I'm satisfied with the changes made by the authors and they address all my major points. I would revise the end of the introduction to either exclude or modify the user-friendly web-server suggestion. As far as I can tell, there is no such user-friendly webserver where a potential user can submit a protein sequence for SNARE vs non-SNARE prediction. I don't think this is a particular problem though as I don't think all methods need to have an associated user-friendly server and that the code shared by the authors is a decent start. I know this is in direct conflict with the other reviewer's suggestion, but including this section in the introduction makes it appear that such a server has been provided. Cite this review as

In this paper, the authors proposed a model to identifying SNARE proteins. SNARE proteins — "SNAP" (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein) REceptor" — are a large protein complex consisting of at least 24 members in yeasts and more than 60 members in mammalian cells. The primary role of SNARE proteins is to mediate vesicle fusion, that is, the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane bound compartments (such as a lysosome). SNAREs are the targets of the bacterial neurotoxins responsible for botulism and tetanus. The authors’ motivation is correct and their efforts should be encouraged. In view of this, the paper holds potential for publication. But to meet the increasingly high quality standard of PeerJ, a careful revision is needed as detailed below. (1) To make this paper logically more clear, operatively more transparent, and practically more useful, the authors should in the end of the Introduction (or right before the beginning of describing their own method) add a prelude, such as: “As shown in a series of recent publications [1-8], to develop a really useful statistical predictor for a biological system, one should observe the guidelines of Chou’s 5-step rule [9] to make the following five steps very clear: (i) how to construct or select a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the predictor; (ii) how to formulate the statistical samples with an effective mathematical expression that can truly reflect their intrinsic correlation with the target to be predicted; (iii) how to introduce or develop a powerful algorithm (or engine) to operate the prediction; (iv) how to properly perform cross-validation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy of the predictor; (v) how to establish a user-friendly web-server for the predictor that is accessible to the public. Below, we are to describe how to deal with these steps one-by-one.” With such a prelude, the outline of this paper and its goal would be crystal clear; its reported results easier for others to repeat. And its attraction to the readership and impact to science would be much higher as well. (2) It is a big plus to use the intuitive set of metrics (Eqs.5-8) to replace the traditional ones copied from math books as done by many in literature. However, in changing fundamental things, such as metrics or rules, the authors should give more description, such as: “Based on the Chou’s symbols introduced for studying protein signal peptides [10], a set of four intuitive metrics were derived [11, 12], as given in Eq.14 of [11] or in Eq.19 of [12].” Also, the authors should cite as many credible publications [11, 13-23] as possible to justify their decision. Furthermore, it is instructive for the authors to add the following in-depth discussion as saying “Either the set of traditional metrics copied from math books or the intuitive metrics derived from the Chou’s symbols (Eqs.5-8) are valid only for the single-label systems (where each sample only belongs to one class). For the multi-label systems (where a sample may simultaneously belong to several classes), whose existence has become more frequent in system biology [24-27], system medicine [28, 29] and biomedicine [30], a completely different set of metrics as defined in [31] is absolutely needed.” (3) It is one more big plus that the authors have provided a web-server for their prediction model. To further stress such an advantage, the authors should in the relevant context add a discussion: “User-friendly and publicly accessible web-servers represent the current trend for developing various computational methods [1-8]. Actually they have significantly enhance the impacts of computational biology on medical science [32], driving medicinal chemistry into an unprecedented revolution [33], here we also provide a web-server at https://github.com/khanhlee/snare-cnn for the new method reported in this paper.” REFERENCES [1] W.

The paper has some typos and difficult to follow sections. I’ve tried to highlight some of the more confusing sections in the following comments. Minor Points: Typo in abstract (76.6%%, should be 76.6%)
Experimental design
label_ed_3
It isn’t clear how cross-validation and independent data sets were produced. As far as I can tell, Uniprot was searched for all SNARE proteins and then proteins that shared over 30% similarity were removed, leaving 245 SNARE proteins. Figure 1, seems to indicate that there are 682 SNAREs used to build and test the model. Where were the extra SNARE proteins found? Is the 682 number found without any similarity filtering? Assuming I’ve read the dataset section correctly, all of the non-SNARE proteins tested are classified as vesicular transport proteins. I’m concerned that the model is thus trained to only differentiate between SNARE proteins and VT proteins. If you put a random collection of protein sequences through the network, does the model always predict non-SNARE? I’m also confused as to how PSI-BLAST was used to produce the PSSM profiles. It appears that a PSSM is built for each protein used to train and test the model. If you used the command line version of PSI-BLAST, can you provide the script or command used to produce the profiles? Also, I don’t understand the part of Figure 1, where all of the A rows are summed up. What is represented in the rows in that image?

Comments for the author
I think the most interesting part of this paper is adapting the convolutional NN type for PSSM profiles. Treating the PSSMs as essentially grayscale images is an interesting if unexpected attempt to force this data type into something easier for the neural network to deal with. Given that one of the goals of the study is to build a model to hopefully find new SNARE proteins (presumably in newly sequenced organisms), I’m a bit surprised that you didn’t make the comparison to simply BLASTing the SNARE and non-SNARE sequences. The output could then be assessing as to whether the first non-identical match was a SNARE/non-SNARE protein. I understand if the true goal was to only assess modern classification methods, but given that PSI-BLAST is already in the pipeline for building the PSSMs, this would seem to be a relevant comparison.
