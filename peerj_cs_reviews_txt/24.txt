Review History A redundancy-removing feature selection algorithm for nominal data To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

In this paper, the author proposed an algorithm named as RedremovingMRLR to select features for nominal data. My main concerns include: (1) I think the novelty of this algorithm is the improvement of traditional NMIFS. Please highlight your unique contributions. (2) In experiments, the computational time of the algorithms should also be compared. The author should analyze the computational complexity at least. (3) There are some typos in this paper. For example Ref. [16]. Besides, there are also some related works should be cited. For example, for feature extraction, “Stable local dimensionality reduction approaches” and “Multiple view semi supervised dimensionality reduction” are two important literatures. For feature selection, I suggest the author to refer “Joint embedding learning and sparse regression: A framework for unsupervised feature selection” Cite this review as

This paper proposes a nominal-data feature selection method based on mutual information . The writting of the paper is very clear. The paper is well organized, and is very easy to follow. The idea in the paper is nice, and it could be accepted with minor revision. Minor comments: 1. The definition of || in Eq.1 and Eq.4 should be clarified and the * in Eq.2 should be deleted. 2 The font size of data set in table 1should be the same. 3 The size of ...(Y_1, Y_2, ... Y_9) used in Experiment 1. 4 Fig. 1a, 1b shows the classification results .... should be Fig. 1a, and Fig. 1b. show (page 11). Cite this review as
