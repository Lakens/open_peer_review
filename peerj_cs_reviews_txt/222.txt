Review History Synthetic dataset generation for object-to-model deep learning in industrial applications To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
Both of the reviewers have pointed out some critical issues that should be addressed. The authors are suggested to make revisions accordingly. [# PeerJ Staff Note: Our apologies for a delayed first decision, however we had difficulty assigning reviewers and in addition one person who had promised a review failed to provide it. #]

label_br_3
The authors propose a method based on 3D modeling and photogrammetry to create synthetic datasets of objects for warehouse management. The results confirm the validity of the approach, in the form of a CNN trained on the synthetic data and achieving high classification results in real world applications. The paper is interesting, technically sound, and well-written. However, some details are too sparsely described, such as: •The ‘3d modeling’ section is rather sparsely described. Maybe consider extending the description to help ensure reproducibility of the procedure. •More details on the synthetic datasets and the training data should be provided. How many classes are generated? How many images per class? What is the size of the image? •More details on the training procedure should also be provided. E.g., how many epochs are used to train the network? On which computing platform? Based on these considerations, it is my opinion that the paper requires a major revision to increase the clarity of the description and ensure the reproducibility of the procedure and the results.

Experimental procedure is too sparsely described. In particular: •More details on the synthetic datasets and the training data should be provided. How many classes are generated? How many images per class? What is the size of the image? •More details on the training procedure should also be provided. E.g., how many epochs are used to train the network?

1.Some figures are fuzzy. For example, the Figure 1 is a little bit blurry, it could be better if a higher resolution one is used. Besides, in the Figure 7, the label of abscissa is incomplete.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
1. In the subsection of Image Classification, authors just use their synthetic dataset to do the experimentation with different CNN architectures. However, they also need to use real datasets for comparative experiments to make their results convincing.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
1. The whole paper lacks enough innovation points, and the methods used are mostly those proposed by others. The author needs to expound his new method and innovation point emphatically
Comments for the author
In the section of LIMITATIONS, the paper shows that "the process of acquiring 3D models and preparing them for rendering required roughly 15 minutes of manual work per product." When the object is large, the author should have further thoughts on how to efficiently scan it with less resources and time. Cite this review as
