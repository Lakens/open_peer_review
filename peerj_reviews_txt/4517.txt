Minor Revisions
The manuscript has been revised substantially, although I see that the authors have chosen not to follow some of the suggestions raised by the reviewers. At least for the wording and phrasing, I urge the authors to follow the suggestion by reviewer #2 (see his/her comments on wording for attachments and insertions) as the current wordings are not correct in the field of anatomy. The authors seem to have a strong opinion on not citing Marjanovic & Laurin (2014). PeerJ is a new platform for open science, and authors are encouraged to expose their opinions and original thoughts in this journal. In this case, I would like you to make the peer-review history of your submission 'open' (i.e. the submission, the reviews, the rebuttal etc are made publicly available upon publication using PeerJ's 'Open Peer Review' functionality). Given the disagreements that are apparent, I believe this extra transparency will explain the review process and the author's reasoning to the readers. I will be happy to accept this manuscript if the authors agree to make this review open.

The authors have now responded to most of my comments. In my opinion, the minor, stylistic revisions are fine, but the reasons they provide not to develop their embryonic discussion further, or not implement other more substantial changes, are not convincing. To take only one example, in their rebuttal letter, the authors state “We did not cited Marjanovic & Laurin (2014) because their updated paleontological timetree of lissamphibians provided no specific estimations of Hynobiidae-Cryptobranchidae splitting time.” This is wrong and surprising, and even though the authors revised their sentence regarding the divergence date between hynobiids and cryptobranchids, it is still incompatible with the timetree of Marjanovic & Laurin (2014) because the authors now state: “Recent analyses of the nuclear exon and mitochondrial genome estimate the Cryptobranchidae-Hynobiidae split as ~150 Ma and the origin of crown-group hynobiids as ~125 Ma (Zheng et al., 2011: fig. 3).” According to Marjanovic & Laurin’s (2014) timetree, there are pan-hynoobiids and pan-cryptobranchids from the Bathonian (166-168 Ma). There is a clear incompatibility between these estimates (for once, the molecular estimates look too young), and I am extremely surprised that they authors don’t see this and don’t wish to comment on this. If new dating of the formations of the relevant fossils falsify the timetree proposed by Marjanovic & Laurin (2014), or if the ideas about the affinities of these fossils have changed, it would be a service to the community to indicate this. The timetree indicates that the divergence dates at least from the Bathovian (Middle Jurassic). The authors should at least rework this point, I think. For the rest, given that I view my role as providing advice, not forcing anybody to do something against their will, so I will not insist further. Some authors are keen on extracting as much impact out of their results as possible, whereas others shy away from drawing inferences based on their findings, and thus, let others exploit their results. The authors appear to fall into this second category ; so be it. They are the ones who will suffer from their academic shyness, and others may reap the rewards of making interesting inferences from these findings, if they happen to notice them (of course, this is far from certain).

Paleontology is not an experimental science, like the rest of morphology and systematics. It is a historical and descriptive science. Thus, most of the points mentioned in the form do not apply.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
Findings seem valid. My only comment is still that broader relevance the findings needs to be highlighted better by more thorough discussions of the most interesting findings. The current version is clearly under-developed, on this front, but given that the authors are uninterested in improving this aspect of the paper, I have nothing to add.

The MS has improved and while I recognize that many suggestions from both reviewers were included, others were not. Most of the not-included ones are well justified in the ‘Rebuttal-letter’. However, one particular suggested change was statet as done but turned out to be not done. In my first review, I wrote: “throughout text change phrasings like “structure FOR attachment (origin, insertion) of muscle xy” to “structure, onto which muscle xy attaches/inserts” or to “structure, from which muscle xy originates”: e.g., lines 32, 441, 616 (ascending process (coronoid process) that serves as insertion …), 707 (projects dorsomedially where the suparcualis[subarcualis] rectus II attaches …); 776 (… end expanded where the pectoral muscles attach.); 790; 805, 806; 825; 827; 869; 902, 904, 906; 914, 916; 918” The authors replied: “—Suggested changes have been made throughout our manuscript text.” But now in the V1 the authors still write: “Proximally on its extensor aspect, the crista dorsalis (dorsal crest) bears a prominent triangular or even knob-like projection, for insertion of the M. subscapularis (Francis, 1934). Proximally on the flexor aspect, the crista ventralis (ventral crest) is a large triangular process, projecting anteroventrally for attachment of the M. pectoralis and M. supra-coracoideus (Francis, 1934) and merging with the head of the humerus (or a facet in some specimens; see below).” The phrases “For attachment” or “for insertion” can still be found numerous times in the text, but in general this is a form of description that should be avoided – e.g., facets are not developed for the attachment of condyles – both develop & evolve together, processes are not developed for muscles, …. Simply, search the document for those phrases and you will see where it should be corrected. However, if the Editor is fine with the phrase/non-correction, I won’t object. Cite this review as

Major Revisions
I have obtained reviews from two reviewers as attached below. Both of the reviewers find merit and novel results in this manuscript, but there are a number of issues (but not critical) to be addressed before publication. Please address all the points raised in the report as all are constructive and should improve the manuscript. I agree with reviewer 1 that the manuscript can be much improved by deepening the discussion. In particular, the evolutionary implications of the anatomical data that you provide. Please attempt to broaden and deepen the discussion, given the guidance provided by the reviewer. Reviewer 1 has also provided a separate annotated file, so please do not forget to incorporate these into the revision.

The text is fairly clear and generally well-written. On the annotated pdf file (attached to this report), I have suggested several minor stylistic improvements, clarifications, and grammatical or typographic corrections. The description is competent. On this front, I only regret that the authors did not provide more illustrations, especially that on-line journals like PeerJ have less stringent space limitations than their paper-based forebears. In this respect, I would very much like to see an occipital view of the skull, and if possible, a lateral view with the quadrate and squamosal in place. The ypsiloid cartilage, the zeugopod elements (radius, ulna, tibia, fibula) should be illustrated too. I find the discussion of the paper weaker, and will concentrate the review on this aspect. The authors do not provide a thorough overview of the evolutionary implications of the anatomical data that they provide. For instance, the seldom-reported ligament connecting the stapes to the quadrate is intriguing. Do taxa that have lost the tympanum (several squamates, some frogs) have this? If not, it would constitute some support for the lepospondyl hypothesis of lissamphibian origins (Laurin, 1998; Marjanovic & Laurin, 2013), because the temnospondyl hypothesis suggests that some distant urodele ancestors had a tympanum (Lombard & Bolt, 1979). Similarly, the claim that the authors make that the absence of the septomaxilla is not paedomorphic is rather weak, to the extent that this bone is one of the last to ossify, and this appears to have been ancestrally present in urodeles (Germain & Laurin, 2009). Not all paedomorphic characters need to be present in all taxa; indeed, theirs lacks external gills… The authors have some evidence about carpus and tarsus development, which bears on the pre- or post-axial dominance being ancestral to urodeles (Fröbisch & Shubin, 2011), but they do not discuss this issue; they should. Also, they apparently present only part of the evidence that they have, judging from line 1101, in the discussion. This is too bad; they should present it all and discuss this point more thoroughly. In the introduction, the authors discuss the fossil record and molecular dates for various cryptobranchoid taxa, but they confuse two (divergence hynobiids/cryptobranchids, and evolutionary radiation of crown-hynobiids), so that the discrepancy between various estimates is even greater than they suggest. This needs to be clarified. Also, I noticed some discrepancies with the latest paleontological timetree for urodeles (Marjanovic & Laurin, 2014); it would be good to know why. Perhaps some more recent research refuted some of the taxonomic positions or stratigraphic age assignments suggested by Marjanovic & Laurin (2014)? The authors, who know these taxa well, could take this opportunity to provide an update. The nomenclatural review (lines 235-249) leaves some issues dangling because it focuses on homonymy, but it looks like there are also synonymy issues, which are currently not discussed, but should be. In the discussion, the presence of a contact between radius and centrale is mentioned in some temnospondyls, but the authors are apparently unaware that this also occurs in at least some lepospondyls, such as Pantylus (Carroll, 1968: fig. 2; Carroll & Gaskill, 1978: fig. 125). There is already an extraordinary bias towards the temnospondyl hypothesis in the literature; no need to enhance this by reporting only part of the evidence. References Carroll, R. L. (1968).
