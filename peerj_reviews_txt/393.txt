Review History Synthetic surfactant containing SP-B and SP-C mimics is superior to single-peptide formulations in rabbits with chemical acute lung injury To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Please clarify the temperature of the saline used to induce ARDS.

Fig 1,minimum surface tension. Most of the data in Fig 1 has been previously published. Please clarify the new data that has not published before.

Generally, the data are well presented using the standard model for ARDS. Additional study with longer periods(at least 6hr of study after surfactant treatment) would strength this paper. Cite this review as

Basic reporting
label_br_2
This is a generally well-written article. There are some minor typographical errors that should be corrected. Specifically: Abstract, line 4: "...absence of specific antidotes besides has...". Either the word "besides" should be deleted or the antidote the authors intended to indicate be included. Abstract, line 17: "...Mechanism_s_ of action..." Introduction, line 8: The sentence should end in a period, not a comma.

Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
It would be helpful to the reader in figures 2 and 3 and in the legends indicating the time-points where the results in improvements in oxygenation and compliance for S-MB+SP-C33 UCLA differ significantly from the other surfactant preparations.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_2
A sentence clarifying or elaborating on exactly how SP-C33 differs from native SP-C (substituting leucines for valines for example) would be helpful to the reader. A sentence in the discussion concerning the relatively short-duration of the experiment related to clinical outcomes in ARDS-ALI (not examined in this kind of study) would be worth including.
