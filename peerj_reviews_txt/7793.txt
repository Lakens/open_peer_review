Review History Exogenous melatonin confers drought stress by promoting plant growth, photosynthetic capacity and antioxidant defense system of maize seedlings To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

This manuscript described the effect of melatonin in response to drought stress in maize seedlings. Two different methods including foliar and soil drench ways were used to precisely monitor the effects of varying concentration of melatonin against drought. Many morphological and biochemical parameters were thoroughly investigated to confirm the positive roles of melatonin. The experiments were well organized and provided solid evidences concerning the melatonin’s physiological roles when the maize seedlings were challenged with drought stress. Authors are missing a couple of recent articles and several typos to be corrected as follows. 1. line 27: change Foliar Application into Foliar application. 2. line 37: lowers to lower 3. line 66: Authors would be better to add the most recent review article (Reiter RJ, Tan DX, Sharma R. 2018.

It is well-written and easy to follow. Data are properly presented and interpreted. But there is no special innovation in this paper. Cite this review as

The author presented a study on the impact of varied concentrations of melatonin on the physiological and morphology responses of maize seedling to drought stress. Many researches on drought stress mitigation by exogenous application of melatonin have been reported. Here, the authors targeted their study by exogenous application of melatonin in leaves and roots of maize, showing that its alleviated drought stress effect by depressing ROS burst, increasing soluble protein and proline content, activating antioxidant enzymes activity, which is an interesting topic. The results are clearly presented. But this article needs major revision, especially the abstract and discussion. After the required revisions, I will recommend publishing.

Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
The results are clearly presented. But this article needs major revision, especially the abstract and discussion. 1) this manuscript showed soil drench and seed drench, but in my opinion, soil drench or seed drench (L 213) is different, which one did the authors use. 2) Please carefully follow the format required by PeerJ. Such as in line 239, after DCK2 add a comma. 3) Please show the pictures of root length phenotype, it will make your results more convincing. 4) The writing should be improved and the format should be recheched.
Comments for the author
Abstract: in this experiment, foliar and soil applications of melatonin were performed, but in this section, the author only showed the results of foliar application of melatonin. Why? L18-19 Please rephrase this sentence, it may make reader confusing. L19 “check” should be replaced by “investigate” Introduction: L33 Please rephrases “Drought is an important to stress” this sentence, it may make readers confusing. L36 delete “pigments” L38-39 Please rephrases “One of the common consequences of” this sentence L44 Please rephrases “an increase in the ROS levels could be toxic” this sentence L66-69 After this sentence, please added references Material and methods: Please add the formulas for calculating the antioxidant enzyme activity, the contents of soluble protein and proline, and the concentration of MDA and H2O2. Results: In this section, the results were clearly presented, however, there are some errors needed to be revised. L205-206 Please added references. L210 delete “in the” L233 change “In” to “in” L258-259 Please rephrase this sentence, it may be make readers confusion. L267 delete “pigments” L268 Please rephrase “In melatonin foliar application” L271-273 please rephrase this sentence, it may be make readers confusion. L273 “Chla” changes to “Chl a” L274 “Chla” changes to “Chl a” L276 “Chla” changes to “Chl a” L283 “(Fig. 1-3)” changes to “(Fig 1-3)” L290 “expansion” should be replaced by another word. L332 “MD1, MD2, MD3, and MD4” changes to “’DM1, DM2, DM3, and DM4”. Discussion: L356 Please rephrases this sentence L359-360 This sentence may be replaced by “During our study, the protective role of melatonin was investigated in maize seedling under drought stress.” L375-376 Please added “Table 1” L376-378 Please added references L388-389 Please rephrases this sentence and added references. L400 “amount” should be replaced by “content” L400 delete “content” L401 “These results indicated that melatonin treatment” should be replaced by “These results indicated that high concentrating of melatonin treatment in leaves” L426 “transportation” changes to “transpiration” L435-437 After this sentence, please added “(Fig 4, Fig 5, Fig 6, Fig 7)” Conclusion: L481-482 Please rephrase this sentence, it may be make readers confusion. L487 “Proline” changes to “proline” Table 1: The unit of root length is not correct, please revision. Supplemental: The unit should be indicated after each measurement indicators and the font need to be Times New Roman. Cite this review as
