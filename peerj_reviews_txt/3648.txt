Thank you very much for making considerable changes to your manuscript in response to my and the reviewers' comments. I believe that you have addressed all of my, and the reviewers', previously-noted concerns, and given that, and the extensive improvements you have made to your manuscript, I have decided not to send your manuscript out for review again. However, I did notice a few typos and a couple sentence that were unclear within this latest version of your article. I have highlighted them and provided suggested edits in the annotated pdf file attached. If you can attend to these minor edits and resubmit your manuscript, I will be happy to accept your article for publication in PeerJ.

Let me apologize for the delay in providing you with a response to your latest submission to PeerJ. Unfortunately, the editor handling your article is no longer available and so I was asked to take over in their place. I have read your most current revision of your article, the two reviewers’ comments, as well as the previous submissions of your article and the associated reviewers’ comments. Considering your latest submission, both reviewers note that you have taken considerable efforts to address their previous concerns and to improve the clarity of your article. I agree with them. The reviewers have also provided detailed feedback as to how you might further enhance your article. Indeed, Reviewer 1 has even taken the time to provide thorough edits to your manuscript, which you can see in the annotated article attached, as well as some questions therein that you must address. Below, I provide some additional comments of my own, but I believe that if you are able to respond to these, and also to the comments provided by the two reviewers, your article will likely be suitable for publication in PeerJ. My general comments: You used capture and injection for the acute stressor. How often is this procedure conducted at the facility where the monkeys were housed? Have they experienced this before? If so, how frequently and how recently? Please provide this information in your article. The final paragraph of your Discussion is pure conjecture. Please remove it and focus on the validation of the methods, rather than the interpretation of them if you do not have appropriate (e.g., behavioral) data to support your claims. Additionally, I think it would be worthwhile if you were able to provide discussion of the application of your (validated) methods. For example, you mention that it is possible that the monkeys you studied might have shown signs of stress in response to tourists. Would this be something that you could test in the future? How might your methods be applied at other institutions or in the wild? How could your methods benefit this species more generally, especially considering its IUCN Endangered status. Comments on specific phrasing within your manuscript: Line 106 – “injection, subjects fully recovered in minutes” – this should be rephrased as “injection, subjects appeared to recover in minutes” Line 115 – “and they usually rested and defecated near the edges of the cage, resulting in entering cages was unnecessary for sample collection” would be more clearly worded thus “the monkeys usually rested and defecated near the edges of the cage, meaning entering cages was unnecessary for sample collection.” Line 203 – “Based three captive adult of a high-stress situation (capture and injection), our results show that it is reliably to detect immunoreactive cortisol (or metabolites) in the urine and feces of golden snub-nosed monkeys by EIA” would be more clearly worded thus “Based on the responses of three captive adult golden snub-nosed monkeys in a high-stress situation (capture and injection), our results show that it is reliable to detect immunoreactive cortisol (or metabolites) in the urine and feces of this species by enzyme immunoassay (EIA)” Line 207 – “But because only one assay was tested with a strong artificial stressor, in the application we should concern its significance when using other assay.” I do not understand this sentence. Please rephrase it. Line 216 and elsewhere, where you refer to the monkeys with the acronym labels, I suggest explicitly noting that you are referring to monkeys to avoid confusion with the other acronyms (e.g., CC and EIA) that you use in your paper. E.g., where you state “First, TT had urinary and fecal baseline levels more than twice those of QQ, and urinary baseline cortisol levels nearly three times higher than SN.” You might wish to write “First, male monkey TT had urinary and fecal baseline levels more than twice those of male monkey QQ, and urinary baseline cortisol levels nearly three times higher than the female monkey SN.” Please avoid retractions throughout e.g., line 223 “so we hadn’t collected it.” should be “so we had not collected it.”

Abstract Line 23-26. Rewrite the two sentences. First sentence is incomprehensible. In the second sentence emphasis the importance of validating the essay that measures CC in feces and urine Introduction Line 38: Mention and Cite Add to dictionary work on baboons as an example for this. Line 40: … to assess the stress response … (also I other places throughout the manuscript) Line 42: Change to: Although cortisol is the major glucocorticoid in most primate species. Line 48: Also state here that essays specific for a range of metabolites and native cortisol exist. Line 54: … for the appearance of cortisol in feces … Line 60: Change to: Thus, for each species, it also important to identify the lag time for cortisol excretion (or its metabolites) besides validating the method to monitor the stress response. Line 74: CC cannot stand for everything (fecal cortisol, metabolite concentration etc.). Rethink the use of the abbreviation CC, maybe just use the term cortisol throughout the manuscript. Line 76 Change sentence: In this experiment, by handling three golden snub-nosed monkeys and injecting a saline solution we stimulated a potential stress response. Line 78: You still aim to measure metabolites, although the essays are specific for cortisol? Methods Line 84: Delete the second sentence. Line 97: change title to Validation Experiment Line 100. … potentially acute stressor …. Line 115: replace …resulting … with … thus, entering … Line 116: It is better to present the average and range of samples collected here. Line 134. Wasser et al (2000) and Fan et al. (2013), and the instructions provided by the EIA kit manufacturer. Line 151: Usually internet addresses can be cited as references and can be included in the reference list. Check with the journal. Line 158: Regression curves of measured and expected cortisol concentrations are presented in Figure 2. Results: Line 186: Is suggest that the authors explain why fecal sample size was low for SN, and how many were collected. Either in the results or in the methods. 197: Replace sentence with : Lag time of urinary and fecal cortisol excretion was examined relative to the timing of injections. Discussion Line 203: Based on samples from three … Line 204: Why metabolites?? Delete. Line 205: …with a commercially available EIA specific for cortisol. Line 207. Is there a reference for the “usually adequate”? Next sentence is confusing. Are the authors planning to use another assay? Line 209: … lag time for this study … Line 212: Don’t start a new paragraph. Be clear here that values are only from tow animals (5 and 23 hours, not between). Line 219: Not clear why TT should have higher peak CC later. Enough samples seem to have been collected. Too much speculation in this paragraph. Line 236. But this was expected considering the acute stressor. Again, there seems to be too much speculation considering that data is only available from 3 animals. The authors should rather end the discussion addressing the aims of the study. Cite this review as

Major Revisions
Whereas both reviewers are happy with the overall content of the manuscript, they have major language issues. I agree with them that the manuscripts needs major revision by a native English speaker. Particularly the discussion is difficult to read. The reviewers have thoroughly reviewed the manuscript and made extensive suggestions for improvement. Please take each of these into account. However, this does not replace the need for a native English speaker's revision. Please also start your discussion with a short summary of your findings: Our results show that ... before you start interpreting them. Avoid going into too much detail of results (omit mentioning the sample size repeatedly) to avoid repetition. Reviewer 2 previously raised objection against the validity of your approach (at that time the comment was: "Although only samples from three animals were analyzed (fecal samples from two animals and urine from 3 animals), this is usually adequate to validate stress assays. But because only one assay was tested with a strong artificial stressor there is not enough significance to publish the results of this validation on its own."). This concern needs to be included into the discussion.

Reviewer one is positive about the general approach of your study, but raises some methodological issues. Reviewer two questions the validity of the study due to the fact that only one assay was tested on a low sample size and with an extreme stressor. He thus questions the reliability of the used assay for the detection of lower stress responses.I agree with his point of view and this fact needs to be appropriately stressed in the discussion and statements about the usefulness of the assay revised accordingly. In addition to the different points raised by the two reviewers, I have the following issues: In general, I would like to see more information on the study species, e.g. social system (i.e. social challenges they might face), habitat they live in (i.e. ecological challenges they might face) as the use of stress hormone measurements is not limited to conservation but is also applied for studies on behavioural ecology, reproductive function etc. Line 49-51: Baseline levels cannot be extrapolated across all studies on a species as long as recovery rates are not evaluated. So I doubt the usefulness of a general baseline determination. More information is needed in the method section: - Important: describe statistical analysis in the method section - How were the monkeys caught and handled?? - Explain sample collection in more details. Obviously, for urine, a special device was used. Describe the device and use of it in the text. How much urine was collected? Did you merge urine samples? How did you get to the faecal samples? Did someone have to enter the cage for sample collection? - You seem to have made some adjustments to the methods based on results previous tests (e.g. dilution of samples). Please describe these. The reference list needs revision for consistency. Sometimes the full journal title is written in capital letters sometimes not and sometimes only abbreviations are given.

The manuscript by Chen et al. describes the validation of an enzyme-immunoassay for determining urinary and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in golden snub-nosed monkey. The general approach is sufficient, but a number of methodological aspects would need further clarification or additional information. To assist the reader, it would also be advisable to request the assistance of a native speaker to improve the language quality of the MS. Line 1: Can the authors please explain what they mean by ‘effectivity’. Further, the authors have to keep in mind that they did not validate the link between urinary and faecal cortisol and stress, but rather a test system to monitor respective physiological indicators. I suggest complete revision of the title Line 10: The study did not validate stress – please rephrase Line 25: The study did not include any analyses via HPLC or GCMS which could have supported the characterisation of respective GC metabolites in golden snub-nose excreta. Thus the authors cannot draw any conclusion regarding the presence of cortisol in urine and faeces of the study species. Please rephrase the statement. Line 29: Could the authors please specify ‘dramatic’ or alternatively rephrase Line 30: I suggest adding ‘… hours post-interference’ Line 38: Should read either ‘…of a stress response’ or ‘ …of stress responses’ Line 42-43: Please specify to which species you are referring to. Line 42ff: The authors should keep in mind that defecation frequency is an equally important factor in this regard. I thus suggest that respective references should also be referred to in terms of numbers of samples produced post-stimulation. Line 48: I don’t understand the link to baseline GC levels here. Although it is indeed necessary to determine an individual baseline for calculating respective stress-related responses (see below), this relationship has not been introduced at this stage in the Introduction. I suggest re-formulate. Line 58: I suggest to exchange ‘employed’ with ‘used’ Line 59: Please specify what you mean by ‘…to analyse results…’ Line 79: The information given in the first half sentence appears somewhat out of context – please re-phrase Line 81-84: Respective information belongs to the Ethics statement (line 64ff) in my opinion Line 87ff: Please indicate how many urine and faecal samples have been collected in total per individual. Further please indicate how many samples could not be collected or used (line 93-94). Were there any samples voided over night? If so, please indicate number and frequency. Line 92: Fig1 can be omitted in my opinion. Line 93: I suggest rephrasing as follows ‘…was collected by using a…’ Line 93: Please specify ‘within reach’ Again mention number of samples not collected as an indicator for potentially missing peak samples post-interference. Line 94: Please indicate if samples haven been stored immediately on ice. If not, I suggest conducting a so called storage experiment (e.g. Ganswindt et al. 2012, Afr Zool 47: 261-269) Line 105: If applicable, please indicate any extraction procedures for collected urinary material. If urine was used natively (as assume), please indicate as well. Subsequently please adjust title of the paragraph. Line 106ff: To assist the reader, please describe the respective procedure for urine and faecal samples separately. Line 119-121: Accuracy of an assay, as defined by the assay’s ability to detect the correct amount of hormone in the sample, is usually determined by spiking samples with a defined hormone concentration. Please provide a respective reference(s) for the approached used. Line 127: I can’t find any information on Data analysis. Thus a respective paragraph has to be included at the end of the M&M section. Here the authors should describe in detail (or give respective reference) how the 3 individual data sets haven been statistically analysed including determination of individual GC baseline levels. Line 130-131: In line with my comment line 119-121 I wonder how the accuracy can be expressed by comparing slopes, as it is usually expressed in percent recovery. Line 132: Fig2 can be omitted as all relevant information with regards to parallelism is given in the text (line 128-131) Line 133-134: If sampling for SN was insufficient, the entire data set should be omitted from the analyses and subsequently the results section. For the description of the intervention-effect, please also indicate individual fold increases in uGC and fGC concentrations. Subsequently the discussion should be adjusted accordingly. Line 143: When comparing signal lag time, the authors should try to justify the references used for comparison by outlining similarities in study setup and housing. Line 157: Is there any evidence for an assumed faster MR for TT? Please also compare in terms of number of samples produced post-interference, even if not collected/used. Line 159: Can’t follow the argument for a higher immunoreactivity, please explain in more detail. Line 165: Difficult to understand, please rephrase. Maybe separate findings for urine and faeces.

The language used and the structure of the manuscript is adequate and the figures are relevant. The cited references are relevant, but there are some more recent primate publications which could have been cited.
Experimental design
Ideally, the authors should have tested different EIA’s (specific for native cortisol, corticosterone and assays specific for its metabolites), especially for the fecal samples were cortisol is often heavily metabolized. Then the best assay could be selected (an important reference is Heistermann et al, 2006: Comparison of Different Enzymeimmunoassays for Assessment of Adrenocortical Activity in Primates Based on Fecal Analysis). The authors showed that the commercial essay for native cortisol can detect an extreme stressor (the handling and injection of saline), but it remains unclear if the assay can detect routinely experienced stressful events. If it is not possible to test additional assays, then the authors should test if the fecal cortisol assay used in this manuscript can also detect these routinely experienced stressors.
Validity of the findings
Although only samples from three animals were analyzed (fecal samples from two animals and urine from 3 animals), this is usually adequate to validate stress assays. But because only one assay was tested with a strong artificial stressor there is not enough significance to publish the results of this validation on its own.
Comments for the author
The validation of stress assays is important and as the authors state, should be carried out for each studied species separately. If the application of this fecal cortisol essay is applied in a study of golden snub-nosed monkeys, then the validation results of this manuscript should be published in that study. For example, the authors could investigate the effect of tourist presence on the captive monkeys. Some further comments: Introduction Line 48: Why it is necessary to establish a baseline for CC change? It is important that the applied assay reliably detects a stressor. Methods Line 67: Why is provisioning of the animals mentioned in the ethic statement? Line 79: I suggest the authors mean: The acute imposed stress is stronger than the impacts of tourists and diurnal rhythm. It would be interesting to know what the impact on stress levels of these factors are. Line 81: More information is needed on how the animals were handled. The injection was probably a minor stressor compared to capture. Line 88: According to the graphs and the raw data samples were collected 4 days before and 4 days after the manipulation. Results Line 112: Is there an explanation why the urine was diluted so much more in males? Line 133. The authors should state if fecal samples were analyses from SN or not.
