Review History A retrospective study of surgical treatment and outcome among women with adnexal torsion in eastern Taiwan from 2010 to 2015 To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The authors made all the suggested modifications. However, in Tables 2, 3,4 contrary to the results section, the authors did not report the data as median and range (still mean and std dev). Please change that. I recommend the article to be published after this minor change.

Major Revisions
Dear Authors, The Reviewers found your manuscript very interesting. Reviewer #2 and Reviewer #3 raised serious concerns, while Reviewer #1 was more positive and generally in favor of publication after a minor revision. In light of the Reviewer's comments, I personally evaluated the manuscript and consider that, after responding to the comments of Reviewer #1, I would suggest to consider the issues raised by Reviewer #2 and Reviewer #3, since they are critical and justified. Please answer all comments in a formal rebuttal letter, discuss and incorporate them in the revised version of your manuscript in order to reach the standard requested for publication. With personal regards Salvatore Andrea Mastrolia, MD PeerJ Academic Editor

Dear Editor, Thank you for the opportunity to review the interesting manuscript entitled ‘A retrospective study of surgical treatment and outcome among women with adnexal torsion in eastern Taiwan from 2010 to 2015’. The authors reviewed the outcomes of 42 female patients with adnexal torsion managed in eastern Taiwan between 2010 - 2015. The paper is interesting and has merits to be accepted after minor revision.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
Major concerns: - Methods: Please use non-paratemtric tests or otherwise prove that data are normal distributed using a statistical test (Kolmogornov Smirnov for example). Please report the data as median median and range or IQR if they are not normal distributed. Chi-sure test should be Fischer s test in some cases - please detail.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
Minor concerns: In Abstract - please detail more clear what mean eastern Taiwan. In Abstract - pleas present the data as median and range or IQR. Table 5 should be moved to Discussions section, not Results. Please discuss the recurrence of the torsion after surgical treatment in the literature and the fertility rate after these surgical procedures.

This study -A retrospective study of surgical treatment and outcome among women with adnexal torsion in eastern Taiwan from 2010 to 2015 is an importent issue among gynecology emergency. Unfortunately this study cohort is small and cast represent truly the study subject. The main idea is important and well disigned but again too small.

Comments to PEERJ 29482 entitled A retrospective study of surgical treatment and outcome among women with adnexal torsion in eastern Taiwan from 2010 to 2015 The authors retrospectively evaluated women who underwent surgical management for ovarian torsion and finally a total of 42 women were enrolled into the current study. Among these, 27 women received laparoscopic approach and the remaining 15 underwent exploratory laparotomy. Conservative surgery was done in one-third of patients (35.8%), suggesting that the majority of patients with ovarian torsion were ended by oophorectomy. Although the authors did not comment this part, it is rational to be explained by only 64.4% of patients who had supposed ovarian torsion preoperatively. However, it is interesting to find that the time interval between the onset of symptom and the final operation is not long, suggesting that the ability of urgent operation is relatively good in the authors’ institute. Some comments are shown below. 1.it is relatively useful to read the difference between radical surgery and conservative surgery. If possible, the audience might be much more interested in this topic. I am wondering why the authors separate their patients into two groups based on the different operation approaches. Tumor size was significantly larger in the laparotomy group, and simple cyst was dominant in the laparoscopy group. Furthermore, fibroma and fibrothecoma were only found in the laparotomy group. All suggested that selection of operation might be biased. In addition, did it mean the surgical approach might be dependent on the “fear” of the malignancy? If the answer is yes, what was the value of the comparison between laparoscopy and laparotomy? 2.If four cases of fibroma and/or fibrothecoma are noted, did ascites exist?
Experimental design
Comparison between radical surgery and conservative surgery might be much more valuable.
Validity of the findings
If possible, please evaluate the relationship between parameters and radical surgery and provide the risk estimation for the radical surgery.
