Review History Tumor mutational profile of triple negative breast cancer patients in Thailand revealed distinctive genetic alteration in chromatin remodeling gene To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Experimental design
label_ed_3
It is not clear which material was used in the study: primary tumor tissues and/or metastatic lymph nodes? It appears that lines 173-178 should be transferred to the section Study Population.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
The study result showed that Thai TNBC has higher tumor mutation burden than previously reported data (ref. 10-12). But the authors compare their results with data from three other studies that have a different design. The analysis in those studies was carried out with the involvement of not only tumor, but also healthy tissue (matched tumour/normal pairs). In this way, germ-line genetic variants could be distinguished from somatic mutations and excluded from analysis. Moreover, in the at least one study (ref. 12) the frozen tumor material was studied. In the other two articles, unfortunately, data on the material is not presented. Formalin fixation leads to significant changes in DNA. Do the authors believe that such differences in design could lead to a higher tumor mutation burden? I can’t fully agree with the statement lines 223-226. A large number of examples have been described when synonymous mutations are significant for carcinogenesis and lead to the synthesis of mutant proteins. So they can create neoantigens and trigger immune response too. See Cell. 2014 Mar 13;156(6):1324-1335. and EMBO Mol Med. 2016 May 2;8(5):442-57.

Comments for the author
The surgically removing primary breast tumors and lymph nodes is standard treatment described in the "Methods" (lines 112). In order to avoid misunderstanding I recommend the authors to describe in more detail which samples were analyzed (primary tumors or lymph node metastases). Cite this review as
