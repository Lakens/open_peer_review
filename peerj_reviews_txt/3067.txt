Review History Hard time to be parents? Sea urchin fishery shifts potential reproductive contribution of population onto the shoulders of the young adults To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
Two reviewers have provided constructive comments on your manuscript. While both were positive, one mentioned additional data that should be supplied (sex ratio, GSI, etc), while the other offered excellent statistical analyses advice. Based on these comments, my decision is 'major revisions' are needed.

Authors indicated that no sampling was done in November, because of the weather condition. However, it is important to have data for this month, because the fishermen are collecting sea urchins starting from November (starting month is very important) as authors said in line 119 "practiced from 119 November to April by 189 professional fishermen authorized"
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
This article is lacking a very important information/calculations for instance: 1- The title is "Hard time to be parents? Sea urchin fishery shifts potential reproductive contribution of population onto the shoulders of the youngest", therefore you should calculate the size at first maturity to detect condition of the stock in the areas of study and to estimate adult and young individuals within population. 3- GSI estimated in the present study, but sex ratio are important too. 2- The authors indicated that the take area under fishing pressure, therefore the calculations of catch per unit effort and exploitation rates are mandatory. In addition, some calculations are important too...... such as growth rate and fecundity.

The authors should edit the manuscript, particularly the introduction, with an eye for proper paragraph structure and topic sentences. 51-77: There’s more than 1 paragraph here. Authors should consult a text on scientific writing and focus on using only one topic sentence per paragraph
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The experimental design is fine as long as the authors are not testing for differences between protected areas and harvested areas. Any analysis with Protection as a factor is flawed. The authors have samples from two areas that happen to have different status for harvesting. There is subsampling of these two locations, but there is no replication of closed and open areas. There is site a and site b. It just so happens That a is protected and b is not. But there needs to be site c and d if you want to test protection level. Table 1. There is no replication for protection level, thus it cannot be a factor in the ANOVA. This is a classic case of pseudo-replication if the authors are trying to say that urchins in protected areas are different than urchins in harvested areas.. I don’t think this is a fatal flaw for the manuscript though, because the results don’t hinge upon proving a difference between protected and unprotected areas. If Protection is changed to Location or Region then it should be ok
Validity of the findings
The findings are valid.
