Review History Probing the origins of human acetylcholinesterase inhibition via QSAR modeling and molecular docking To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_1
The currnet manuscripts is in the scope of the journal , however, the work seems to be carefully done, some few points need attention before publication.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
In the present contribution, the authors proposed a large-scale QSAR investigation for predicting AChE inhibition.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
I believe that the idea is original and the work could contribute to the development of new AChE inhibitors.

Whereas the work seems to be carefully done, some few points need attention before publication. In my view the idea is original and the work could contribute to the development of new AChE inhibitors. The QSAR study presented seems good to me. In this line, please find bellow some suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript. 1)The authors should report applicability domain of the developed models according to Chemom Intell Lab Sys, 145, 2015, 22-29, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2015.04.013 . 2)The authors should also use rm2 metrics for validation. See J Comput Chem 34, 2013, 1071-1082, http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.23231 and Journal of Chemistry, vol. 2016, Article ID 9198582, 12 pages, 2016. doi:10.1155/2016/9198582. Please introduce those papers. 3)A deeper discussion about the docking results is need. 4)Finally, the following references could be introduced in the paper: JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS. VOL.: 33, 2048-2058 (2015). CURRENT BIOINFORMATICS VOL. 8, 496-510 (2013). JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 27, 641-649 (2016).

Basic reporting
label_br_2
Overall, the introduction explained well about background. However, it is needed to explain more about inhibition mechanisms of AChE. For example, carbamates and organophosphates inhibit AChE by forming covalent bond with catalytic serine residue, and dual binding site inhibitors for reversible binding and block the access of ACh.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
Materials and methods section includes sufficient information about data set development and model design. However, there is no concern about mechanism of actions of different inhibitors. I guess some of the selected substructure fingerprints represent important interaction features of inhibitors for forming the covalent bond. For example, C=O in carbamate and P=O in organophosphate are reaction center for forming the covlent bond
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The selected fingerprints and observed interactions from docking study are reasonable.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_2
This work dose not provide new information about mechanism of action or interaction features for AChE inhibitor. However, their model is based on the largest data set and provides reasonable performance. Cite this review as

The work has been carried out with care. The reviewer feels that this manuscript can be accepted. However, a few minor points to be addressed. In abstract section " line 4 should be " This is not the only reason for AD. There are many hypothesis for AD (Cholinergic, Amyloid, Tau hypothesis etc). As per cholinergic hypothesis, this may be one of the reason of AD. In Fig. 2 and 3 color code has been changed. Similar code should be followed for uniformity. Cite this review as
