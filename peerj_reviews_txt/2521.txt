Review History Three-dimensional paleohistology of the scale and median fin spine of Lophosteus superbus (Pander 1856) To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Lophosteus is an enigmatic and debatable taxon in the quest of the origin and early evolution of osteichthyans or bony vertebrates. This well-written manuscript provides the first description of the morphology and paleohistology of a fin spine and a scale from Lophosteus using virtual thin sections and 3D reconstructions, and adds a lot to the understanding of the nature of this key taxon along the stem lineage of osteichthyans. The figures are in high quality and well described.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
The discussions and conclusions are objective, logically consistent, and rigorous, based on the available data. Methods in this manuscript are described with sufficient detail. In summary, this is an important contribution to the research of early vertebrates and paleohistology, with its original primary research within the PeerJ scope.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
The description of the two scans and restorations is detailed, informative and clear, thus providing the rich source of morphological and paleohistological data for the further discussions relating to early vertebrate growth and phylogeny.

Clear, unambiguous, professional English language used throughout. yes Literature: citations missing, citations wrong, papers in references, which are not cited. And relevant citation missing. Figures: can be reduced (e.g. fig. 4 is a repetition of fig. 3B); 3D figures high quality, 2D figures grey, bad quality (differences between tissues not visible)
Experimental design
label_ed_2
The authors refer to new information by 3D synchrotron data, that is only the case for the morphology and the canal system, the histology is still 2D and with bad, grey pictures (less informative than Gross 1969)
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
not very new, repetition of Gross 1969 data are robust
Comments for the author
label_cfta_2
Title misleading, there is only a Two-dimensional paleohistology .. nevertheless a Three-dimensional morphology of external features and the internal canal system …. All the virtual sections are 2D not 3D; they are grey and do not show the tissues (figures by Gross 1969 are much more informative). You need to show thin sections to justify denteons. Literature: citations missing, citations wrong, papers in references, which are not cited. And relevant citation missing.

Comments for the author
This is a solid descriptive paper presenting important new information on the histology and microstructure of an important fossil taxon, Lophosteus. Due to its unresolved phylogenetic position, any new data on this genus is vitally important for helping place it phylogenetically and to make meaningful comparisons with other 'scale and part' taxa known principally from fragmentary remains. The descriptions are good, as are the illustrations. I would like to see a short summary in the conclusions listing precisely what new features/histological structures have been found in this paper, to be clearly laid out for readers who are not familiar with this topic. Other than that I have no real criticism of the work, it is very detailed and could be published as is. My suggestion is only to improve the final version for readers outside this specialised field.
