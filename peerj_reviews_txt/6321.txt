Review History Protein signatures linking history of miscarriages and metabolic syndrome: a proteomic study among North Indian women To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

1. How many patients were included per group - please provide details. 2. Please statistics analysis of these four group of clinical characteristic of patients, including maternal weight, age, height, BMI, blood pressure, etc. in a Table. 3. Please include the internal standard protein (like ß-actin or GAPDH) in Western Blot analysis, by the way, if the number of samples is less than three, how can you caculate the P value?

The article entitled " Protein signature linking history of miscarriages and metabolic syndrome: A retrospective proteomic study among North Indian women" want to identify the proteins signatures to understand the connection between the history of miscarriage and metabolic syndrome. These results showing some new findings, however, there are several points need to be improved and revised before further consideration. >The text must rewriting, because current text is too redundant. -For example, In Abstract The sections of Background and Methods must be simple and clearly. The section of Results do not need repeat the words in the text. It is better to describe the key new findings. What is the “in the three case groups”? What is the “in the two case groups”? Which is the control? >What are the standards for grouping? Miscarriage and MeS based on what? Must give more information to explanation. >The quality of 2-DE gel needs to improve, for current image it’s hard to say about the accuracy of the results. >The number of the differentially expressed proteins is too few; I cannot concluded any significance thighs from Fig3. >Why the western blot in Fig6 have any control band? The results of validation are not right. In the other hand, the quality of the blot is very low. >Table 2 This table must give the p-value of each differential expression result. Cite this review as

The experimental design of the study is appropriate and well thought. The methods reported in manuscript is well described.
Validity of the findings
Data reported in manuscript is meaningful. The study reports proper control and replicates.
Comments for the author
In this study, entitled "Protein signature linking history of miscarriages and metabolic syndrome: A retrospective proteomic study among North Indian women" authors investigate the presence of protein signatures in premenopausal women cohorts. The authors undertook 2D-gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry approach to determine the differential expressed proteins in experimental and control cohorts. Based on the data provided authors suggest that, they have identified 18 differentially expressed proteins in experimental groups and they have also validated the up regulated TTR by various protein assays. The study is significant in profiling the protein signatures on human samples of miscarriage and metabolic syndrome, however following things need to be addressed before publication 1: There is no term like single Mendelian Population. Author should change it to “Mendelian population of same gene pool”. 2: In figure 6, it is not clear whether the authors have compared group A with other three groups or three experimental groups are compared with control group (Group B). Figure legend needs restructuring. 3: Did authors follow up on individuals with increased TTR for their cardio vascular parameters? It is important to know if they show such sign of CVD disorder. 4: Discussion section is too long. It can be shorten a bit. 5: While citing fig in manuscript author should follow one consistent pattern of as advised by journal guidelines. Presently, both round brackets (... ) and square brackets [... ] are used. Cite this review as
