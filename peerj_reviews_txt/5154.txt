Review History Identification of SNPs potentially related to immune responses and growth performance in Litopenaeus vannamei by RNA-seq analyses To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_2
More and precise details of how SNPs were identified are needed, especially, the minimum depth coverage, min number of reads calling SNPs, MAF. It is not clear why max missing 0.5 was used. The reviewer found this manuscript very lengthy (especially in the results and discussion part), and I strongly suggest that the authors should make it short and concise. The manuscript could benefit from discussing and citing calculating the allelic imbalances, in addition, the exist/does not exist of SNPs studies in rainbow trout.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
A small number of fish was used especially in the disease part. The RIN quality value of the RNA was 1.8-2.2, I am not sure if this a typo or not because this is not an acceptable value.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The major problem of this study is that none of the SNPs were validated, at least 10 SNPs or so should be validated by sequencing, or by any other platform, outbred populations should be tested as well. Otherwise, it is hard to make sure these SNPs are high-quality true SNPs.

Comments for the author
In this manuscript, Camilla A. Santos and colleagues employ RNA-seq analysis to explore the SNPs related to L. vannamei growth performance and innate immune responses. L. vannamei is of great economic importance in worldwide aquaculture. Shrimp growth and immunity are of great interest for aquaculture activity. The results reported in this study enriches the genomic databases available for shrimp. And also, may be potentially applied in high-density chips and high-density linkage maps for Genome Wide Association Studies, association analysis between complex traits genotypes and phenotypes, and allelic-specific expression studies. This study is of interest. However, the following questions should be addressed before recommendation for publication. Line 54-61, the introduction of shrimp immune system is not precise and comprehensive, e.g. “crustaceans do not own a real immune system”. Shrimp does not have the adaptive immune system but has a powerful innate immune system. Shrimp Toll-like receptors/IMD-NF-kB signaling pathways (PMID: 21827783; PMID: 19232438) have an equivalent role to mammalian TLRs/TNF- NF-kB cascades. Nucleic acid-induced antiviral immunity (PMID: 23773856) and RNAi-, phagocytosis-, and apoptosis-mediated innate immune responses should be extensively described in this part (PMID: 24886688). Otherwise, this part will mislead the readers. Line 111, “Shrimps exposed to WSSV (WSSV group)”. The sample size is too small, four samples may not representative enough for SNP study (line 117-118). Can the authors explain why they choose muscle and hepatopancreas for cDNA library construction but hemolymph for WSSV-qPCR test? The primers and detailed testing method should be given for testing WSSV. Line 333, “Shrimps exposed to WSSV (WSSV group)”. The authors report that inhibitor of apoptosis has SNPs in L. vannamei exposed to WSSV. Shrimp IAP1-3 has been shown to play roles in host defense against WSSV (PMID: 23967321), the potential mechanism, such as blocking apoptosis against WSSV infection, should be discussed. It is amazing that all the polymorphisms are in coding regions. Can the authors give a rational explanation? Are similar findings reported by other publication? Cite this review as
