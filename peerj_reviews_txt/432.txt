Review History Anatomical and biomechanical traits of broiler chickens across ontogeny. Part I. Anatomy of the musculoskeletal respiratory apparatus and changes in organ size To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Comments for the author
label_cfta_1
Overall very good work. However, as a potential reader of this publication my first impression would be that this manuscript is excessively lengthy and somewhat overloaded with data sets. I would suggest to shorten the manuscript, and present the data sets, in more concise manner. For instance, the information presented in Tables 1 &2 can be fitted in a single table, as well the data presented in Tables 4, 5, and 6 can be presented in a single Table. You have analysed (discussed) your findings in the context of the data of others in text, at length, but as a reader of your publication I would like to see some summary figure or table presenting your current numbers, and comparing the studied variables on historical time scale from the perspective of natural history of changes of these variables at different stages of genetic broiler improvement over the last 50 years or so. Undoubtedly, all readers of your work would appreciate this. Cite this review as
