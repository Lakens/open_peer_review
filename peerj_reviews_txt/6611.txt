Review History Identification of gene-phenotype connectivity associated with flavanone naringenin by functional network analysis To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

While the paper has substantially improved, I still agree with the first Referee, in that there are some strange sentences throughout the manuscript. I would therefore suggest some language editing before its publication. # PeerJ Staff Note 1 - this decision was reviewed and approved by Keith Crandall, a PeerJ Section Editor covering this Section # # PeerJ Staff Note 2 - If you wish, we can provide English copyediting services for a fee - please email us at editorial.support@peerj.com if you are interested in this option. #

Major Revisions
Dear authors, Please find below the reports of two Referees. I would advise to put special care in the description and explanation of the methodology; especially in the justification of some methodological steps, like the threshold of 25 in the degree.

label_br_3
1.The English language should be improved and the manuscript needs professional care. For example, in Line 21 “consequences showed that naringenin...” should be “the results showed that...” 2. The legends for the figures should be better described. In figure 4, what’s the difference between the links with and without arrows?
Experimental design
label_ed_3
1.The PPI network construction of naringenin-mediated proteins is not sufficiently described. The STRING web server has provided the PPI network for the input protein list. But in line 77-78 and 109, the PPI network was constructed by Cytoscape. Did the authors used any special plugin or modules of Cytoscape to construct the PPI network? Or just visualize the network? Please make it more clear in methods part. 2.Why did the authors select the hub proteins by node degree larger than 25? It’s a relative high degree, please give more explanation.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
Why just prostate cancer was chosen as the phenotype associated with naringenin-mediated proteins? Is it just because of hormone related? If so, why other types of cancer that hormone related were not considered, such as breast cancer.

Comments for the author
This paper used a set of bioinformatics tools to integrate available data on naringenin, and find some prostate cancer related genes. The authors proposed that they find gene-phenotype connectivity. What is the genetype and phenotype here? PPI network and prostate cancer? I don’t think the relationship between PPI and prostate cancer is the most important finding here. So, I suggest using a more specified title. More comments are listed in the following: 1.The first step is to put naringenin into the 8 targets returned by DrugBank without screening. Among them, the ttgR gene belongs to Pseudomonas putida species and the other seven genes belong to human. I was wondering if is more reasonable to not include ttgR gene in the further analysis, as prostate cancer is the human disease 2.In the network analysis, degree > 25 was used to select key proteins. This analysis seems too simple, and the authors may use more network parameters to make their finding more convincing. 3.What the network scale used for pathway analysis? STRING can give networks with different scales. Please clarify it 4.There are various English problems. It it better to have a proofreading service. Cite this review as
