Review History Body image, visual working memory and visual mental imagery To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

This is an extraordinarily well written article presenting novel and important results, i.e. that a measure of visual memory is related to body dissatisfaction and that visual representative abilities can protect against body dissatisfaction. I strongly recommend it should be published in PeerJ. There are three very minor revisions to be made: Line 201: I would recommend a section on "Instruments", followed by "Procedure", rather than "Design and Materials". In addition, I believe that readers are familiar with the concept of Body Mass Index so that it does not need to be defined in the methods section. Rather, the equation could be included in parentheses when the term is first mentioned. Line 434: the word "other" seems superfluous. Table 3 line 798: The number of participants should be added (N).

Basic reporting
label_br_2
The presentation complies with all PeerJ specifications excepting the change in font (to Arial, I believe) in lines 280-303 which should be corrected.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
In lines 240 ff, the computer application of the VPT should either reference standardization of this application or note that accessing mouse responses could possibly enlist visuo-motor skills not engaged in the original VPT.

The abstract summarizes the study reliable. The scientific background is clearly presented and prior literature considered appropriately. Figures are relevant and appropriately labeled and discussed. The article complies very well with "self-containment," and clearly specifies the import of the results. The English composition is flawless. An excellent paper worthy of publication Cite this review as
