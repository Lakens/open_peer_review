Review History Evaluation and identification of stem rust resistance genes Sr2 , Sr24 , Sr25 , Sr26 , Sr31 and Sr38 in wheat lines from Gansu Province in China To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Line 288 to 291 need revision (words are repeated). The molecular genetic markers linked to associated with Sr2, Sr24, Sr25, Sr26, Sr31, and Sr38 were used to detect the occurrence of these genes in 75 major wheat cultivars (lines) in Gansu Province in this study. Change to: "The molecular markers associated with Sr2, Sr24, Sr25, Sr26, Sr31, and Sr38 were used to detect the occurrence of these genes in 75 major wheat cultivars (lines) in Gansu Province in this study" In general the conclusion seems need paraphrasing; Suggestion: Breeding resistant cultivars is an economic and effective way to protect wheat from disease. The development of molecular technology facilitated the identification and utilization of molecular markers for durable resistance breeding, leading to increased crop production. The molecular markers associated with Sr2, Sr24, Sr25, Sr26, Sr31, and Sr38 were used to detect the occurrence of these genes in 75 major wheat cultivars (lines) in Gansu Province in this study. The results showed that 35 tested cultivars might carry one of these genes. This information can be used in breeding for stem rust resistance in the future. Cite this review as

The authors addressed all of my concerns. I have some additional edits to improve the English of the newly added sections of the manuscript: Abstract – change “a donor parent” to “donor parents” Line 125 – use “genes” instead of “gene” Line 311 – use “adult plant resistance” Line 312 – use “chromosome arm” Line 350 – use “Wheat plants carrying stem rust resistance gene Sr25 were susceptible to several…” Line 352-353 – change to “to wheat chromosomes 7D and 7A from Thinopyrum ponticum (references).” Line 357-358 – use “, but with white flour (Bariana…” Line 358-359 – “The use of this gene in wheat programs is increasing for… and the Ug99…. potential yield increases….conditions” Line 416 – delete “linked to” Cite this review as

* There are some sentences that are ambiguous and must be corrected and written in clear English and must conform to professional standards of expression. Examples: lines 114-116, 117-120, 131, 141-145, 173-174, 186-187 * Citation in the text has o follow the standards Examples: line 182, 186-187 * Headers of some of the tables did not explained well the contents of the respective tables. Examples: Tables 4 and 5 need footnote what is "+" and "-". There is a correction for the headers of Tables 1, 2 and 3 that is highlighted in the attached annotated PDF. * Needs specific conclusion based on on the obtained result rather than just putting a general conclusion at the end of the abstract and at the last part of the conclusion section (highlighted in the annotated PDF).

Basic reporting
label_br_4
The manuscript will profit if corrected by a native speaker. References in the text and at the end are in agreement, as well as figures and tables
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The manuscript is withing scope and aims of PeerJ, objectives of work are clear. Material and method: lack of information about symptoms and scores which specified for each level of diseas. Even in figure 1 not all type of scores have been included. More details about used markers is missing. Missing data about used wheat cultivars and their pedigree, how they are related.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
For this reviewer the amount of information provided is not sufficient for publishing in PeerJ, but if authors can provide more data about used cultivars, infection types using more races and more Sr markers, then the manuscript could be reconsidered.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_4
The paper "Stem rust seedling resistance genes evaluation and identification of Sr2, Sr24, Sr26, Sr31 and Sr38 in wheat lines from Gansu Province in China" describes analysis of seedling resistance to 3 stem rust isolates at 75 local wheat varieties followed with marker analysis being diagnostic to 5 known stem rust resistance genes. Authors found that 42 or 66.0% of tested wheat varieties are resistant to tested races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, while molecular marker analysis showed that 13 cultivars likely carrying Sr2; 25 carrying Sr31; and 9 Sr38. No cultivar was found to have Sr26 and Sr24. Cite this review as
