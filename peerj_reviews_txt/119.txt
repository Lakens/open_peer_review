Review History Microsaccades restore the visibility of minute foveal targets To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
Reviewer 1 has asked for additional discussion about why low-contrast stimulation failed to be restored bymicrossacades and the mechanisms that could be involved in the restoration of the foveal target visibility after microsaccades.

label_cfta_1
The manuscript aimed to investigated a paradigm that previously showed that stationary objects faded without eye movements. The new contribution of the present manuscript was to focus that investigation in the foveal vision. They had interesting results that showed that microsaccades restored the visibility of foveal targets. They showed that the higher stimulus contrast, the higher microsaccade rate. The discussion is very good, but I think they can stress more why low-contrast stimulation failed to be restored by microssacades. What kind of mechanisms would be involved in the restoration of the foveal target visibility after microsaccades? The method used by the authors actually could be used to estimate the contrast sensitivity of that possible mechanism. Cite this review as

Basic reporting
label_br_2
The submission adheres to all PeerJ policies.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
The experimental design is appropriate and it has been thoroughly explained. The statistical analysis is rigorous including the correction for multiple comparisons.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The findings are not only valid but they provide a much needed complement to a previous report by the same authors suggesting that small saccades produced during attempted fixation can restore visibility of faded targets at all eccentricities, including the fovea.
