Review History Effects of sound exposure on the growth and intracellular macromolecular synthesis of E. coli k-12 To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

My original comment on figure-4, regarding high OD values seems to have remained unanswered. However, I leave it now to the Editor to make final decision on it.

label_cfta_2
"speakers were immersed in nutrient solution" in the revised version; this sentence is almost the same as "speakers were put into nutrient solution" of the original submission. I still feel, it conveys wrong meaning. Was the speaker in direct contact of the liquid? Please modify that sentence so as to leave no confusion for the reader. Cite this review as

Major Revisions
Please take account of the comments of both reviewers. Please make sure to look carefully at the annotated manuscript kindly provided by the reviewer in your resubmission. I also urge you to provide strong reasons as to why this study was performed in the first place and some mechanistic insight would aid us in making a final decision on the manuscript

Effect of sound exposure on the growth and intracellular macromolecular synthesis of E. coli k-12 by Gu et al., reports on the effect of sound waves on the growth of E.coli K12. This reports talks about the use of sound waves of different Hz and Db on E.coli and looking into its growth and intracellular macromolecular synthesis. At present the study is phenomenon based and needs answering crucial mechanisms.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
An elaborate review by Gemma Reguera in Trends in Microbiology, 2011 ( 19,105-113) talks about excellent papers on the effect of sound in various model system. Hence, this paper becomes redundant as this is not a new report. The experimental design should take into consideration different media composition with different viscosity as sound travel different in different medium
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
Though it is very nice to see the effect of any system on organism, at present I am not able to appreciate this study as it does not brings out why this study was done.

This study talks about the biomass and the macromolecular synthesis in E.coli in response to sound waves. 1. How is the signal perceived by E.coli? 2. The EM data adds nothing to the study. AFM is required to understand the intricate changes int he membrane or cytosol. 3. The increase in biomass will lead to increased synthesis of macromolecules. This experiment also does not add up anything to the study. 4. Is this phenomenon conserved among different strains of E.coli? Cite this review as

label_br_4
Authors have chosen to investigate in the area of cell-sound interaction. This is an interesting, but much less-researched area. Hence any meaningful contribution in this area of research should be encouraged.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
Experimental design seems to be sound. However, the manuscript needs to include some explanatory notes on, how sound 'intensity' differs from 'power'. By providing these (and other such) details, the authors can make their manuscript more readable for a audience, which is likely to be comprised largely of biologists.
Validity of the findings
Findings seems to be acceptable.
