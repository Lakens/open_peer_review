The relevance of the statement " Since post-operative sleep............surgical patients " in lines 61- 63 is not understandable after stating the hypothesis.Moreover, what the superscripts used in these lines indicate is not clear. Is it references? The relevance of this statement here needs explanation. The statement in lines 149 and 150 " TST values were significantly reduced..........increased" is not clearly understandable. The statement here should be clearly expressed as per data stated in the table. Similarly the statement in lines 156, 157, 158 and 159 " IL-6 levels..........significance" is not clearly understandable. The statement here should be clearly expressed as per data stated in the figure. In table1 , (line 361) the total number of male and female, analgesic intake are stated under the column of median. The table needs to be revised. Cite this review as

1. Were any of the subjects active smokers or on smoking-cessation therapy (e.g. nicotine patches)? As the act of smoking may be stimulatory in nature and affect your results (or alternatively sudden cessation of smoking may affect the patient's sleep cycle). 2. Line 60/61: "complications that complicate..." suggest slightly change sentence to make it sound better. Cite this review as
