I think the manuscript has been significantly improved. The circular assembly of PET2 mtDNA looks much better now. It represents a unique contribution and should therefore be published. The other two assemblies for the fertile and the CMS PET1 are also of public interest. In the latter two it would be nice if the nad5 would be given with its location. The PET2 DNA assembly also supports the data obtained by Reddemann, Horn 2018. Orf228 represents orf231 without counting the stop codon and orf246 corresponds to orf288 (without stop codon and the possible elongation at the 5’ end of the atp9 gene). However, in our fragments nad5 was on the same fragment as atp9 and the split atp9 was on the fragment together with the orf2565 (DNA polymerase type b homology). This might be looked into it again.

Next generation sequencing data allow assembly of whole mtDNA genomes, which has been done in this manuscript. The coverage was sufficient for obtaining the results. Duplications were detected.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_1
In Table 1 amplicon size needs to be corrected. Either use bp than some values have to be changed from 0.9 to 900 or use kbp but then other values have to be changed from 162 to 0.162. Please correct one way or the other! The manuscript still needs some improvement with regard to the English language.

The authors fixed the majority of the typos and significantly improved presentation of the material. Mathematical formulas (such as 1+E^<U+0394>Ct formula) should be typed using an appropriate equation editor.
Experimental design

The authors assembled the genome and, therefore, the manuscript does not look like a dump of half-cooked results anymore

qPCR and Sanger validation of discovered rearrangements was conducted.

The manuscript is well written and describes the assembly of the mitochondrial DNA of the fertile, PET1 and PET2 cytoplasm in sunflower from next generation sequencing data, which in principle is very interesting and new for PET1 and PET2. However, the assembly of PET2 is not satisfactory. The offer of two circles that cannot be combined is not helpful. It indicates the mtDNA for PET2 is not correctly assembled.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
Results for the RT-PCR should be shown and should include the study of fertility restored hybrids.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
1. The manuscript requires presentation of one circle for PET2. The coverage might not be high enough or hybridization results might be helpful to solve the problem. The early publication of two premature mtDNA circles for PET2 is not helpful. 2. For claiming an involvement with the CMS phenotype at least the effect on transcripts in fertility-restored hybrids should be shown. It is not enough that an orf is expressed in the male sterile line, but not the fertile line. 3. The sequence of the 5 kb insertion in PET1 is already present in NCBI (accession Z23137.1) and should be mentioned in the manuscript. Homology between the sequences should be discussed. 4. The two open reading frames, orf645 and orf1053, which are supposed to be involved in the CMS phenotype encode proteins of about 21 kDa and about 35 kDa, respectively. The CMS-specific protein detected by in organello translation for PET2 has a size of 12.4 kDa (Horn and Friedt 1999). This might be an indication that both new open reading frames, only transcription is stated for orf645, might not be involved.

Please take your time to correctly assemble the PET2 mtDNA! I think you do not gain anything by publishing preliminary data even though you put already a lot of work into the the manuscript. Cite this review as

The paper should be seen by a native English speaker or a technical editor. There are multiple typos and unnecessary punctuation signs. For example, " revealed two single nucleotide insertion: thymidine insertions in 35690-35691 and 129368-129369 positions of NC_023337" should be " revealed two single nucleotide thymidine insertions: in positions 35690-35691 and 129368-129369 of NC_023337". And the following sentence " Considering that due to 2 SNP is not reasonable for appending current data (HA89 fertile line complete mitochondrion sequence) in the NCBI databank" should also be completely reworked. "MC2 cyclization was failed" -> :"MC2 cyclization has failed"
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The PET2 genome used is not fully assembled. It would be desirable to produce the entire genome. I do not anticipate this task to be theoretically or practically challenging
Validity of the findings
There was a new open reading frame orf1053 described in the genome. This in silico discovery should be supported by RNA seq data. This may be a chimeric gene or assembly artifact,etc. The authors need to analyze structure of promoters and distribution of TBFS to support the function of the identified genes.
