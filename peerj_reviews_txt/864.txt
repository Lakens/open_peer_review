Review History Properties evaluation of silorane, low-shrinkage, non-flowable and flowable resin-based composites in dentistry To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Very interesting study comparing physical characteristics of different dental resin-based composites. The article is well presented and the study well designed.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
Well designed study. It would help the reader, however, to know which shade was used and how many specimens were produced (sample size of the study).
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The conclusions of the study are supported by the result, however, see comments on the Experimental Design.

label_cfta_2
Well written manuscript, very interesting topic. The manuscript would need minor revisions: 1) Shade of the products; 2) Sample size for each test 3) punctuation at the Reference List. It is missing or inconsistent. Cite this review as

A well done study. Need to simplify the results as explained in the Summary, Abstract and conclusions. Grammatical corrections required.

The type of composites rather than the trade names need to be referred.The page numbers of the references are not as per the guidelines. Cite this review as
