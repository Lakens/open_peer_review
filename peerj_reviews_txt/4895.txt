Review History Time to get our four priorities right: an 8-year prospective investigation of 1326 player-seasons to identify the frequency, nature, and burden of time-loss injuries in elite Gaelic football To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
Dear authors, Thank you for submitting this paper to PeerJ. You will find the reviewers' reports at the foot of this email. You will see that, as well as having a number of positive things to say about the paper, they have some concerns, and have, for the present at least, advised against acceptance. However, it seems likely that, with some further work, a revised version could be acceptable, and I would like to invite you to re-submit, without commitment, a re-drafted version of your paper, paying attention to the comments and suggestions that we have made, for further review. With respect and warm regards, Dr Palazón-Bru (academic editor for PeerJ)

The management of the risk of injuries is a very important question. Understanding the extent of the injury problem is the first port of call in preventing sports injuries. The present study aimed to investigate the speed at which elite Gaelic soccer players suffer different injuries due to loss of time during the game and training activities. The article includes sufficient introduction and background to demonstrate how the work fits into the broader field of knowledge
Experimental design
label_ed_2
The investigation must have been conducted rigorously and to a high technical standard, in conformity with the prevailing ethical standards in the field.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The data is statistically sound and controlled.

The manuscript is very well written; references used are recent and relevant. No major issues with the article structure, however, it would be important to learn from the Editor if the style used to present the references and the unstructured abstract are acceptable by the Journal standards or must be adjusted.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
The experimental design does not raise any concerns. Nevertheless, relying on the reports from medical staffs, as the author acknowledge always leads to relevant bias. Also, it would be very interesting to have more details on the training and match loads (e.g. number of matches per week, number of training sessions, type of training sessions). Methodology is well described, however no details are given on the source of information regarding the players exposure.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
In general, results and discussion are well written and the conclusions linked with the research question. However, this is where I have some concerns regarding the manuscript: 1) although I understand that the exposure is calculated multiplying the number of hours of training or match by the number of athletes present, that is not explicit in the text; 2) also regarding the exposure, no details are given regarding the source of the information. Was data sent by the medical teams clearly indicating the number of training sessions and matches and the number of athletes present at each session/match? Or was that an estimation made by the authors? 3) Line 113 to 117: Team rates – please explain, if the overall injury rate per season is 42, and only match and training are considered, why the gap (24 match injuries and 15 training injuries = 39 injuries)? Then, Line 189: (…) reveal that teams sustain 24 match-play and 13 training injuries per season (…) 4) Line 131 to 158: Again a gap that I was not able to follow/understand: a) Match injuries associated with the onset of 55.8% of all new injuries (…) training associated with the onset of 38.7% (…) of all new injuries b) Match injuries associated with the onset of 59.3% of all recurrent injuries (…) training associated with the onset of 35.6% (…) of all recurrent injuries 5) Line 170 to 171: Match-play incidence (50.5 ….) was 13-times higher than training incidence…. However, Line 189: Injury incidence per 1000 exposure hours is 12.9 times greater in match-play (48.9/1000 hours) 6) A larger discussion of the study limitations should be included in the discussion and removed from the conclusions.

Dear author, thank you for the opportunity to read this very well written manuscript describing the characteristics of sports injuries sustained by Gaelic Football players during eight seasons. Gaelic football is not very popular outside Ireland, but the similarities to other football codes (e.g. rugby union, American football, soccer) made it very interesting for me to read your manuscript. I have expressed my concerns and I am sure that you will be able to provide the necessary clarifications to make your paper ready for publishing. Cite this review as
