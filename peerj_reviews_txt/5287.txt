Review History Patients with chronic periodontitis are more likely to develop upper urinary tract stone: a nation-wide population-based eight-year follow up study To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Statistically significant 1% increase in the outcome in CP group may still be due to the large sample size. Is it clinically meaningful?

The article is well written,unambiguous and falls well within the scope of the journal. However, there are several typo and grammatical errors in the manuscript. Language edited certificate from Class'A' language editing company is recommended before publishing the article.The study is presented and published as an abstract abstract i in the Journal of Urology (2013)( http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347(13)02278-7/abstract ) as a conference abstract and can be mentioned in the manuscript.

Investigators evaluated the association between chronic periodontitis (CP) and kidney stones (UUTS) and report that CP increases the risk of kidney stones significantly independent of key covariates such as age, gender, and diabetes etc.
Experimental design
label_ed_6
This is an 8-year follow-up study embedded within a national insurance database in Taiwan. The exposed group is the ones with ICD codes for CP (N=16,292). Controls were randomly selected (do not know how exactly) subjects without CP (N=48,876). Over a roughly 8 year follow-up, the risk of UUTS was 1% higher in the CP group which was statistically significant (HR=1.14, 95% CI, 1.08–1.20, p < 0.001) which remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_6
The study is well conducted and is large. The analysis is appropriate. The results are presented clearly and logically. Are the methods used to detect the absence of CP in the 'controls' is the same as that used for the CP group obtained from the insurance data? That can influence the findings. There is only a 1% increase in UUTS and that can very well be due to chance as the study involved thousands. This needs to be discussed. A strong biological model how the CP might increase UUTS is also a worthy discussion. However, the external validity of the study is supported by the findings that the CP group had significantly higher diabetes as expected.

Basic reporting
label_br_7
This manuscript needs to be edited by an individual fluent in the English language. Literature references don't give full support background to hamper the research question.
Experimental design
The research question is skewed. While the authors justify, in a sustained way, the association of PTH levels elevation in periodontitis patients, the association of uric acid metabolism with periodontitis is merely an attempt without scientific support. I would suggest the authors put more effort in first to guarantee this association of uric acid metabolite with periodontal disease prior to any further assumption. The authors didn't consider obesity, hyperuricemia, family history of stone disease and dietary habits as possible confounders, and those are important characteristics to minimize selection and analysis biases. This manuscript should be reviewed by a biostatistician to ensure the statistical analyses are appropriate. Why did the authors decide for a frequency matched 1:3? Did you perform any statistical test to get score matching to select controls?
Validity of the findings
Although this can be considered a novelty and the robust data, this paper has serious flaws and the authors must consider tune down the statements such as ‘CP increase the risk of developing UUTS’.
