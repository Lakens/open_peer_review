Review History Divergent relationship of circulating CTRP3 levels between obesity and gender: a cross-sectional study To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_1
The overall conclusion of the paper is supported by the data presented. The authors clearly articulated the limitation of the study.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
No issues with experimental design. The authors use the appropriate statistics to analyze their human data.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
The findings are valid and limitations of the study are clearly indicated
Comments for the author
label_cfta_1
This human study adds to the growing literature on CTRP3, a secreted plasma protein produced by adipose and other tissues. While the sample size is small, the data indicates interesting sex-dependent differences in circulating levels of CTRP3 between male and female under different (patho)physiological states.

Basic reporting
label_br_3
Well written, good language. The introduction and background provide context for study. Figures and tables well labeled.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
Although stated, the serum specimens are not-fasting, and this is different methodology than used in all other studies examining circulating CTRP3 in humans, making these results very difficult to compare to other authors' findings.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
1) Although the author's found discordant results with previous studies examining CTRP3 in CAD, obesity, diabetes and gender, interpretation has to be cautious because these serum samples were not fasting (different than previous studies), and the author's did not mention which CTRP3 Elisa was used in each study, which can also affect comparison between study results. 2) The author's state that the average BMI is 24.9kg/m22, but with 57% of the patients obese with BMI >30kg/m2, can the authors clarify the breakdown of BMI in this study cohort. ( also in Table 2, the mean BMI listed as 33.09kg/m2).
Comments for the author
Although the authors argue that their findings are novel, a lot of similar findings are embedded in prior publications. Overall, well written manuscript. Add into discussion that results can be different based on ELISA used and because samples not fasting. Cite this review as
