Dear Authors, As you can see from the comments of Reviewer 2, it is felt that you need to further expand your treatment of the international literature to correctly place the article in a wider context (regarding comparisons to other work and possible alternate explanations).

I feel a wider use of the International literature in terms of comparisons and alternative explanations is still needed.

The authors used clear and easy to understand English Background of the study •Review of literature on study’s background is scanty and does not present a clear picture the said topic. A more rigorous literature relating to the acceptance of e-Health by care providers would be needed Problem statement •The authors state from line 6 … there exist a wide gap… does this gap relate to adoption by care providers? •On line 11 the authors have to be precise regarding the population of Nigeria (delete “about” •Reference is needed at the end of line 15. •I am not sure about the clarity of the problem statement – Seems to be motivation for the adoption of e-Health by healthcare organizations – acceptance at organizational level – Relate problem statement to individual acceptance of e-Health
Experimental design
label_ed_2
Study Objectives •Research question “e” could have been answered by formulating and testing hypotheses relating to various constructs in the model to verify any association between the identified factors and the dependent/outcome variable Theoretical background •I am not sure what theory underpins this research. On the one hand the authors state theory but did not make reference to any particular theory. Instead the authors chose to talk about TAM under research model. TAM, could have been placed under theory instead of research model Research model •On line 15 the authors introduce “patients…? •On line 21 are human capacity and organizational factors. But these factors/constructs are not present in figure 1. Sampling of participants •On line 21 are “non-medical staff… But these participants are clearly not healthcare professionals/providers! •Regarding the cover letter and the questionnaire – Did the authors assumed every healthcare provider or staff of healthcare facilities in Nigeria already know what e-health is?
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
Analysis •The authors state they have introduced three constructs (Human resource, …) to make up for the deficient TAM model. The authors do not state how those constructs were measured? Lots of missteps Discussion •I'm afraid all the proposed questions have not been fully answered.

This interesting piece of work aims to investigate, identify and analyse the underlying factors that affect healthcare professionals decision to adopt and use e-health technology applications in developing countries, with particular reference to hospitals in Nigeria. That's well run and written and deserves consideration for publication. However, I have some minor comments authors may wish to address.

That's a cross sectional survey. Classical limitations should be considered.

That's a cross sectional survey. Classical limitations should be considered. Please use for example http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g2276?variant=full-text&hwshib2=authn%3A1513021746%3A20171210%253Ac207388f-8e7f-4a58-afe9-4041e6889f8c%3A0%3A0%3A0%3AIlFK0SLMhD6Ywi7DihLqJQ%3D%3D for limitations and https://www.strobe-statement.org/fileadmin/Strobe/uploads/checklists/STROBE_checklist_v4_cross-sectional.pdf for reporting issues. Also, I feel some wider International comparisons should be made using for example https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/478904 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27107907 Cite this review as
