mention if the plants of Jatropha are toxic or non toxic, It would be appropriate to change the title and that is more specific, as are different agro-climatic conditions throughout southeastern Mexico of "Reproductive biology of the plant Jatropha curcas biofuel in Its center of origin" to "Reproductive biology of the plant Jatropha curcas biofuel from Soconusco, Chiapas. "describe in detail the climatic conditions of the Soconusco

Recommend that the study had been conducted in a plantation of a hectare, as live fences show the differences with a real plantation, a soil analysis is recommended to determine the content of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium correlate the results with flowering and weather conditions (temperature and average rainfall)

increase the number of plants evaluated because only were ten plants

1. mention if the plants of Jatropha are toxic or non toxic, 2. It would be appropriate to change the title and that is more specific, as are different agro-climatic conditions throughout southeastern Mexico of "Reproductive biology of the plant Jatropha curcas biofuel in Its center of origin" to "Reproductive biology of the plant Jatropha curcas biofuel from Soconusco, Chiapas. " 3. describe in detail the climatic conditions of the Soconusco, 4. increase the number of plants evaluated because only were ten plants 5. behavior is different than a plantation plants as a hedge, as well the proximity of plants live fence is one meter between plants Cite this review as

I found this paper to be relatively straight forward and to the point. Being removed from botany for as long as I have did amount to constant breaks in the reading to refresh myself with certain terminologies and forgotten concepts. Once made comfortable I had no issue with the work. Aside from some minor grammatical suggestions I found it needed little editing.
