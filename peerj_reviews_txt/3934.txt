Review History Tolerance: the forgotten child of plant resistance To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_1
The manuscript addresses a fairly major shortcoming in the use of tolerance resistance in plants to arthropods. The material is presented in a straight forward manner and set up in a very readable format. The figures give good supporting back up to the points made in the text, and the references are thorough equally supportive. Some additional detail in the terminology used in the figures would improve their impact and utility in making the point of the review.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
Well addressed, as to the types of normal exp. designs used in plant resistance research, those unique to the study of tolerance and the limitations posed by lack of development of new methods.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
The logic-based conclusions reached by the authors make use of real-world data to point out the limitations of current knowledge about tolerance plant resistance.

A good and timely review. Nice to know others are thinking of management tactics beyond single-gene, high-dose defenses. Cite this review as
