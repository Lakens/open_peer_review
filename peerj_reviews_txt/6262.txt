Review History Effects of table tennis multi-ball training on dynamic posture control To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

In next studies please try to find correlation of multi-ball training with overall balance or postural stability. You can used some dynamic tests as Biodex balance system or some similar. In this study you provide to us info's about CoP distribution during the testing procedures.But it will be good to know the post effects of multi-ball training on the overall balance after few sessions of multi-ball training.
