Review History Genomics analysis of genes encoding respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs) in jatropha and the comparison with castor bean To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
Dear authors Gerard Lazo, the Section Editor wants to suggest the following: “The manuscript reads well, but is lacking in updating the gene family characterization by using an ontology annotation, or by providing the new sequence data to a public resource (like GenBank) where it can be made available in proper formats. Some of this is in supplemental files, but none of these made their way towards being characterized in a public resource. Likewise, if an EST is mentioned the accession number, bioproject sequence, or assembly data should be pointed to so that sequence validation can be conducted by the reader. Journal manuscripts are often scanned by text-mining software that locates and extracts core data elements, like gene function. Adding standard ontology terms, such as the Gene Ontology (GO, geneontology.org) or others from the OBO foundry (obofoundry.org) can enhance the recognition of your contribution and description. This will also make human curation of literature easier and more accurate. None of this was visible. Since many bioinformatic exercises rely on easily adapted pipelines for sequence characterization, we should have such manuscripts add further characterization so that comparisons can readily be created using works already in the public domain. Adding useful annotations will go far in building informative databases. GO terms are a strong attribute tied in with the Arabidopsis and many other communities, and as these resources were cited it would be a complementing service to do the same, and would heighten the value of the manuscript. It is the use of such terms which have moved the technology further in recent years. As different expression profiles were addressed and the fine detail of the gene structure was also addressed, adding appropriate GO terms would be very helpful to the readership of this gene family. This should not be a large hurdle for the authors.“ Please follow the advice and submit a revised version of the manuscript.

Major Revisions
Dear author Your paper has been assessed by three reviewers and myself as academic Editor. As you could see below, the manuscript needs a major revision. Most importantly: Please clarify the methods. Add experiments of gene expression analysis Misconceptions need to be corrected. Statistical treatment of data needs to be more rigorous. Please address all concerns of the reviewers and submit a revised version of the manuscript. Please include a detailed response to each reviewer. I have been informed that PeerJ is now offering a language correction service for a fee. Please consider it before submitting the new version of the manuscript.

Abstract Lines 36-38. Phrase is not clear.. no duplicate was identified in both.. corresponding to no recente whole... is a double negation.. M&M section Line 90.. Arabidopsis and rice rboh genes were obtained ... that means this genes were amplified?, cloned? Line 114..Gene expression analysis.. the gene expression was done in silico?, under what conditions the plants were grown? Results section Line 133-134.. seems repetitive to 136-141. Sube 166. and Isrbigd, And variation.. Lines 170-181, after describir fig 2a and 2b, jumps to figure 3, then Lines 182-188, is describing figure 2c, Line 172. The average theoretical MW (molecular weight) Line 174. average pI .. the I is the italic letter Expression profiles jcrboh genes... what about castor genes? this section is just in silico analysis?, but conditions of experiments could change from experiment to experiment.? so you do not have control of expression profile? IND, STD, PID are not defiende. Line 214.. the response to drought and salt stress was investigase.... this experiment was carried out in the present work or was also in silico analysis?, if was done in this work, information about the experimentos should be added in M&M section. Line 227.. respondes to coletotricum.. was investigated.. no mention in M&M section Line 233.. regulación by hormones.. not mention in M&M section. Figures Fig 2A. the three is mixing C,G, A sequences, H, B, sequences, seems not a very good classification of groups Describe in figure legend what means motif 1, motif 2 and so on Fig 4. describe in figure legend the meaning of std, , pid, ind, leaf age¿, which age?,
Experimental design

Needs to be more clear, the work was an in silico analysis? experiments of gene expression analysis are not described

label_votf_3
there is not a results supported by experimental design explained in the text.

label_cfta_3
The most concern is about the gene expression analysis, no information about the experiments design are present, then is not clear if presented data is also an in silico analysis reviewing all information deposited at databases. Cite this review as

The MS is well written and presented. Please notice that R. communis common name id “castor bean” (not just “castor”).
Experimental design
label_ed_4
Since data for expression analysis were taken from public data banks,how did authors make sure they were comparable? At present form, I'm not totally convinced that differences noticed, both among tissues and conditions are really comparable and, therefore, representative. It would be advisable to confirm these trends with actual lab results (PCR analysis of transcripts abundance, for example).

The manuscript “Genomics analysis of the respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) gene family in jatropha and the comparison with castor” attempts to presents a genome-wide comparative analysis of Rboh family genes in economically important non-food oilseed crop jatropha (Jatropha curcas) and castor (Ricinus communis). Overall, the manuscript conforms to the structure recommended by the journal viz. Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusions. The findings of the study are well discussed and supported by existing evidence. The overall English comprehension and grammar of the article is good and attains standards of a scientific article. The phylogenetic analysis of jatropha and castor with model monocot and dicot provide insights into species-specific functions. However, below are a few suggestions that would be useful for the readers and make it scientifically thorough. 1.Supplementary table S1 and S2 can be combined into a single excel file with information of S1 and S2 table as two separate sheets. 2.Please improve the legend of Fig 1 by incorporating information for e.g. the scale of the bars etc. 3.In the legend of Fig. 2, please provide the scale for the number of amino acid substitutions per site. Also, mention in the text what do the numeric values represented on the top of each clade correspond to?
Experimental design
1.In line 116, how did the author obtain clear reads from raw reads? Please specify exclusively in text. 2.Usually, the average width of the transcription factor binding site is 10bp. Why did the author select such a wide range from six to 180 residues in line 113? Please justify. 3.Please specify Bowtie2 parameters in line 117, unless used default. 4.Please specify if authors have used either existing packages or in-house scripts for identification of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in line 120-121. 5.In addition to DEGs, it would be great to provide a list of all the genes with expression and significance as supplementary.
Validity of the findings
The study is experimentally sound and well presented. For further comments refer section Experimental design.
