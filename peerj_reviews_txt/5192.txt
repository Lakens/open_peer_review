Review History High expression of SLC26A6 in the kidney may contribute to renal calcification via an SLC26A6-dependent mechanism To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
Thank you for submitting your work for publication to PeerJ. As per the appended comments, all reviewers felt that the paper needs major revisions before it can be considered for publication by PeerJ. In addition to all the comments made by the referees you should address in greater depth the apparent contradiction between your conclusion and Jiang's et al., earlier results (2005) with Slc26a6-null mice discussed lightly in your ms.

Basic reporting
label_br_4
1. In the introduction section, more background information is needed for the biological process and chemistry of kidney stone formation. Also, the authors can move the content about oxalate secretion from the discussion section to the introduction section. 2. References are needed for Lines 37, 38, 42, 44. 3. Bright-field images are needed for Figure 2b. 4. In Table 2, the authors should also provides the sequences of other primers and synthetic fragments. 5. In Line 80, write the full name of the acronym IHC. Also, write the acronym SDS-PAGE in Line 83. 6. In Line 91, in triplicates is more often used than thrice. 7. In Line 119 and other places, it is lentivirus ‘infection’ not ‘transfection’. 8. In all figures, y axis units are missing. 9. In Line 255, is it Figure 3b or 4c that should be referred to here?
Experimental design
label_ed_4
1. In Line 74, the authors need to describe the method here other than citing a previous publication. 2. About lentiviral infection, which lentiviral infection system did the authors use and how was the titer calculated? More experimental details are expected, such as what are the packaging and envelope plasmids, transfection reagent.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
In Figure 3a and 3b, it is strange that lentivirus infection did not change Slc26a6 gene expression in duodenal tissue. I am wondering if the infection was successful, maybe the duodenal tissue is hard to infect using the specific lentiviral infection system. Did the authors see RFP expression in the tissue? If so, the authors should provide the image and give a hypothesis of the tissue-specific expression.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_4
The authors should check the usage of acronym. For example, in the legend of Figure 3, standard deviation and SD were used alternatively. The same problem happened to IHC, too. Cite this review as

The manuscript in title of High expression of SLC26A6 in the kidney may contribute to renal calcification via an SLC26A6 dependent mechanism aims to investigate the role of kidney SLC26A6 in urolithiasis. This is a nice manuscript and been well prepared, however, revision should be done before it could be accepted for publication. More information should be added in the instruction section;
Experimental design
label_ed_5
The experimental design is good and been well conducted, however, several issues need be fixed. The method for lentivirus transfection into the kidneys of rats is questionable; regarding the efficiency of lentivirus subcapsular renal transection. Please provide more information about this procedure.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_5
1. Better images should be provided to demonstrate the location of SLC26A6 2. In line 101, please change the word “animal culture”. 3. Images in fig 1D are not comparable, please update them. 4. English editing is needed.

Comments for the author
All the 10 patients identified as stone formers had hyperoxaluria. Since there are other stone types, please explain if the patients were selected according to previous records of hyperoxaluria or by the analysis of stones previously eliminated. In those 10 patients was a diet rich in oxalates excluded as a cause for the stone formation? The transfection of lentivirus with Slc26a6 sequence and lentivirus with siRNA anti-226 Slc26a6 into the kidneys of rats was achieved by injection in the organs. How many injections were done per kidney to obtain a good spread of the vector? For how long can the vectors remain in the kidney? The fragments of kidney tissue used for Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were obtained from parts of the organ well apart from the local of the injections? Why two weeks was the time point decided and not 4 or 8? 90%–95% endogenous oxalate is excreted by kidneys. Did the animals in the siRNA-Slc26a6 groups have any evidence of oxalate overload in the organism? Transfection with lv-Slc26a6 and siRNA-Slc26a6 was carried out in 4 plus 4 animals. This is a relatively low number. Please show individual values in fig 3 and 4 for each one of the transfected rats using a graphic plot as used in fig 1 for patients. This request is for valid for Western Blot, immunohistochemical staining intensity, urinary oxalate and crystal formation. Cite this review as
