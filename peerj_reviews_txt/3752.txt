Review History Remote sensing and spatial statistical techniques for modelling Ommatissus lybicus (Hemiptera: Tropiduchidae) habitat and population densities To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

This is the second revision of this manuscript. English language is clear and professional. The references are adequate and relevant, the issues related to bibliography raised in the first review have been all addressed by the authors. The article, which is over 60 pages long is articulated in the usual section and also according to the methods reviewed and it now has a study area section with a distribution map of the pest. My opinion is that the article is still too long and not very well balanced among the sections. The list of abbreviations is complete and useful. The review of satellite types and resolutions can be shortened. Also geostatistical methods are known to most readers and can be described in less detail. The manuscript should be put in a more concise form before publication.

Raw data is not available, but being a review, it makes sense like this.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The main objective of this paper is to review remote sensing and geographical information analytical techniques that can be applied in mapping and modelling the habitat and population density of O. lybicus in Oman. The Proof-of-concept Cases section and the conclusions now provide information about the sensors, techniques and spatial resolutions that could be best suited to address the problem of this pest of the palm plantations. This is a major improvement. Being a review, the authors refer to published data and did not provide raw data or scripts to reproduce the work.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_2
I was about to reject the manuscript without reading it, because you stated in the message to the editor that "The only change we have made is to the title." I then discovered, with the help of the Associate editor, that instead you carefully addressed the comments of both reviewers. I suggest to pay more attention to such claims in the future.
