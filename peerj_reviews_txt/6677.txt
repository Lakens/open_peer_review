Zhang et al. reported comprehensive identification of auxin response factor (ARF) genes from lirchi, a commercially important fruit tree, especially in China. The litchi ARF proteins were named according to the phylogenetic analyses with ARFs from other model plants, Arabidopsis, rice and tomato. The introns and exons structures of the genes were compared among LcARFs, and conserved domains of ARF were identified. The authors also found target sites of miRNAs in the LcARF genes and discovered a novel miRNA pathway to regulate LcARF9s expression. The authors analyzed expression of all LcARFs in various organs/tissues by qRT-PCR and also analyzed effects of abscission-inducing treatments by RNA-seq. Throughout the manuscript, the experiments were well done and the results were satisfactorily and concisely described. However, the profiling of RNA seq data should be re-analyzed with a normalization method other than RPKM because comparison among samples with RPKM has been demonstrated to be inappropriate (Wagner GP, Kin K, Lynch VJ. Measurement of mRNA abundance using RNA-seq data: RPKM measure is inconsistent among samples. Theory Biosci. 2012, 131(4):281-5.). Other points 1. In line 162, “Class I” should be collected as “Class II” according to Fig. 1. 2. In line 195, the authors described that “all LcARF genes were expressed in all organs/tissues studied”, although in some tissues, the expression levels are very low based on the results in Fig. 4. Generally, by qRT-PCR, it is difficult to distinguish very low accumulation of mRNAs from contaminated genomic DNAs or non-specific amplification. In the context of the manuscript, it is unlikely necessary to claim the significant expression in all tissues. The authors can mention that expression of all ARFs was detected at least in several tissues, which still means that all ARF genes found in this study are likely functional but not pseudo genes. 3. In line 197-199, the authors described that the class I and class III ARFs were expressed at higher levels in “ML”. The authors have defined that ML is “mature leaves”, thus these genes may function in mature leaves but not in “male flower development”, which is described in line 199. 4. In line 242, the authors described none of the LcARFs seems to be activator. As the authors mentioned, there may be no activators with glutamine rich AD, but the data could not exclude the possibility that some ARFs may have other types of ADs. 5. Please indicate SE or SD for the error bars in Fig. 4B. 6. In the graph for LcARF9B in Fig. 4B, the numbers of Y-axis are not located at equal interval. I don’t know the journal rule, but I have never seen the numbers in axes of graphs showing as “.5” and like that. Cite this review as

The article is in good writing. But "phylogenetic analysis" and "evolution" are much different. There are some TasiRNA in “miRNA regulation” . Please modify your title of manuscript. Cite this review as

This manuscript has elaborated transcriptional analysis based on qRT-PCR of LcARF gene family. It predicts important roles of these LcARF genes in various tissues/organs/zones and hormone-treated conditions. The authors conducted an interesting investigation on a topic that is of interest to several plant biologists and hence shall invite a broad range of audience. The quality of work and illustrations are excellent. I recommend this for publication after the authors carry out some minor revisions raised by me. The revisions will improve the readability of the paper. 1.Authors should provide the resource of Litchi genomic database. The detail of predicted protein sequences of LcARFs should also provide. Authors also should indicate some report of characterization of ARF family in important crops such as rice, maize, soybean in introduction paragraph. 2.Nomenclature for LcARFs should use no.1--> 39. The chromosome location of LcARFs should include in Table S1. Gene names should be corrected in Italic in Figures 4,5, table S1 and main text of the manuscript. 3.Authors should discuss more of the evolution as well as the tissue specific of the LcARFs to identify some potential genes for further analysis. 4.Authors should include a conclusive table for the important genes and their function, observed in the transcriptome study in tissue/zone specific and hormone condition, that can be used for further functional validation. 5.Author should be correct the English, format errors and missing of citation. For example, length of proteins (aa), molecular mass (Da) L151-154, italic format for the gene name. Cite this review as
