Review History Early identification of recurrence in ovarian cancer: a comparison between the ovarian cancer metastasis index and CA-125 levels To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

In general I believe that it is a quality paper with interesting and relevant results, taking into account the small sample size as mentioned by the authors. The English would still require some small improvements (please refere to the comments I the attached file). Literature references are adequate.
Experimental design

label_br_4
The English language should be carefully revised to improve the clarity of the scientific message. For example, lines 60 (“Thus far, …”), line 75 (”By such an …) and line 191-193 (“The high degree…”) should be rephrased.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
In the introduction, the authors did not refer to NCC which is used to compare results with CA-125 assay in the result section (Table 1, Table 2 and Figure 2). OCMI should be better defined in the introduction as a hybrid model of NNC and multiple linear regression as defined in the Material and Methods section. Results Section: Metastasis and multi-organ metastasis should be better defined. Metastasis refer to peritoneal metastasis? And Multi-organ metastasis refer distant metastasis (e.g. lung) or refer to organs within the peritoneal cavity (e.g.liver) Figure 1: Graphic A should be reformulated to show that within the “Active responders” which ones respond negative.
Validity of the findings
Discussion: The final message should be positive and demonstrative of the strong points of the presented work. The limitations should be discussed in the beginning of the discussion.
Comments for the author
Wang F. et al presented a work with ovarian cancer patients to evaluate the precision rate of the ovarian cancer metastasis index (OCMI) to predict disease recurrence. The results where compared with classical follow up biomarker (CA-125) and Neural network cascade (NCC). Authors showed that OCMI ROC was 0.856, NNC ROC 0.804 and CA-125 alone was 0.752. Moreover, OCMI level predicted recurrence earlier than CA-125 values (1 chemotherapy cycle earlier). The improvement of OC recurrence prediction is of paramount importance and the idea of refining the already available follow up methods would accelerate the implementation of this improved method in to the clinical. The aim of this work is therefore very significant but the present manuscript require some alteration in order to clarify the results. Cite this review as
