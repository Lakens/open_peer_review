Review History The rediscovery of the rare Vietnamese endemic Eriophorum scabriculme redefines generic limits in the Scirpo-Caricoid Clade (Cyperaceae) To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The manuscript is well written and structured, with all sections in clear professional English. The authors refer to relevant literature and provide detailed context were needed e.g. explaining application of place names in Vietnam. Sequence and occurrence data used are shared as supplementary files and info is provided on where the studied herbarium specimens can be accessed.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
The data and methodology used are suitable for the answer the posed question on the phylogenetic position of the studied species. This study is part of research focused on the Scirpo-Caricoid Clade of Cyperaceae by the authors and contributes to a better understanding of generic limits in this group.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
Data and methodology are sound. The conclusions are solid and based on the presented results.

The authors present the rediscovery of an "Eriophorum" species narrowly endemic to an ~200km area of Vietnam. Using a combination of morphological, embryological, and molecular data, they demonstrate that this species is nested within Trichophorum and is only distantly related to Eriophorum. Based on this evidence, they transfer the species to Trichophorum scabriculme. This is by far the easiest review I have ever conducted. The writing is clear, the evidence for their results is overwhelming, the figures are helpful, and the species descriptions and key are thorough and useful. My only suggestion for improvement is that the overall length of the manuscript can be reduced significantly. I appreciate that the authors provide such a thorough context for the taxonomic delimitations of this these clades, but I found it to be unnecessarily long - and, much of it is rehashed again in the Discussion. Similarly, the phylogenetics section could be reduced - this is essentially the same tree, using the same molecular markers, that the authors have now published a number of times. A simple acknowledgement that the topology is consistent with their previous studies, and a brief mention of the placement of T scbirculme, could be sufficient. Cite this review as
