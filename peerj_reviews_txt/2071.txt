Review History Sex expression and floral diversity in Jatropha curcas : a population study in its center of origin To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

English text should be corrected. Some options for improvements have been indicated in the uploaded paper with my comments. The paper should improve the description of the various PCA analysis, especially with respect to the traits put into the PCA analysis. It is possible to show the coefficients of the different traits on the biplots. That would show the reader how the axes are made up. Also, it should be investigated how an overall analysis with all accessions in one PCA can be done. Lastly, the relationship between the biodiversity dendrograms and the PCA plots and the theme of the paper (sexual types) should be made more clear.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
OK, but an overall PCA analysis could be welcome, plus a description of the make up of the PCA 1 and 2 axes in the overall analysis (still to be shown) or the individual PCA analysis.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
In principle OK, but the authors should elaborate more on the theme of the sexual types in relation to biodiversity analysis.

Comments for the author
The present manuscript entitled "Sex expression and floral diversity in Jatropha curcas: A population study in its center of origin" The authors have put the best efforts to characterize the sex expression and floral diversity of potential species Jatropha curcus, The species is having significant importance as a biodiesel plant having good economic importance and because of the improper distribution by anthropogenic activity due to its economic importance the species is losing its valuable natural genetic resources and the research work conducted is very much relevant to the present context and much needed. The over all the work conducted and analysis made is in good scientific standards and manuscript suitable for the publication. However to review these minor points given bellow: Corrections: •In title the name of the plant should include “L” correct it to “Jatropha curcas L” •In few places of the manuscript the plant name is not in italics <U+F0A7>Figure 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Table 1. The Manuscript is discussed well and I recommend strongly for publication. Cite this review as
