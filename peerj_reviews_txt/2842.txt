Review History Taxonomic revision and molecular phylogenetics of the Idarnes incertus species-group (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae, Sycophaginae) To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The manuscript as well as all supplementary materials are very well written. I have just some minor comments provided directly into the .pdf file of manuscript (see attachment) and some comments to Suppl. mat. 2: Page 1 Lines 9-10: "OL, distance between posterior and anterior ocelli (measured from posterior ocellus to anterior ocellus)" - this abbreviation is redundant as it is not mention along the text Line 30: "Bouché," - replace by "Bouché." Page 3 Line 16: "Notauli" - should be replaced by "notaulus" Line 22: "1/2x" - should be replaced by "0.5x" Line 30 "(BMNH)" - replace by "(BMNH))" Page 4 Line 21: "1/5x" - should be replaced by "0.2x" Line 33: "Notauli" - should be replaced by "notaulus" Page 5 Line 5: "1/5x" - should be replaced by "0.2x".

An excellent and thorough revision. Well done! It would be preferable to also include the FigWeb URL in citation of the online keys in the main body of the manuscript: "Multi-entry online keys were produced using Lucid ® v. 3.3 and are available at FigWeb (www.figweb.org) 112 (van Noort & Rasplus 2016) and as supplementary material 3."
