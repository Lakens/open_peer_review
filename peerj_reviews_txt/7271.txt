Review History Three-dimensional printing with biomaterials in craniofacial and dental tissue engineering To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

the article is a good article but has ignored the work most important to this article. therefore it should discuss the work of bio-electrospraying and cell electro spinning. the following article should also be cited, Small, 2(2006)216-219. Analyst, 136(2011)878-890. Biomacromolecules, 7(2006)3364-3369. Analyst, 138(2013)2215-2223.

There are a number of cases where there is no space before the reference, see: "disease(Rai et al., 2017).", "developing(He et al., 2015)", "shaping(Torres et al., 2011)"; or indeed figures: "layer(Fig.1B)" The authors should use the correct symbol for micro instead of the u, e.g.: "50um". Please correct ALL instances. Please change "The control of porosity’s" to read "The control of porosity" The authors correctly state "SLS was developed by Carl Deckard" but fail to cite the thesis - please correct this. Also include other research output from Deckard and coworkers. The authors correctly state "SLA printing dates back to 1986, when Charles Hull, ‘father of 3D print’, first promoted the 60 term ‘stereolithography’ in his U.S. patent, Apparatus for production of three-dimensional 61 objects by stereolithography" but fail to cite the patent - please correct this. Also include other research output from Hull and coworkers. The authors cortectly state "Binder jetting is a technology developed at almost the same period with FDM. Its first development is in the early 1990s. In 2010, the first binder jetting machine was commercially obtained." but fail to cite the patents/papers - please correct this. Figure 1 legend needs to explain what A-D are. Figure 2: legend needs correcting as it appears the image is reproduced from another journal, so the authors need the copyright permission from the publishers of those images (supply this to PeerJ with the revised manuscript), and to ensure the legend is the same as in the original manuscript, and to cite the manuscript.

the article is a nice article but does not do very much to the literature as there are many such review articles. also the article hasn't spoken about cell electrospining and bio-electrospraying.

1. How many articles were searched for by the keywords described? Does table1 list all the articles and How did authors filter these articles? 2. For the articles searched, how did evaluate the authenticity and reliability of the results? 3. could the authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of different cell lines and different animal models?

The manuscript by Liao and colleagues is interesting and well presented. The topic is relevant to the field of tissue engineering and can be of interest for the readership of Peer J. The introduction well matches with the subject presentation.
Experimental design
The study is well designed and the methodology is consistent as well as the bibliography section. Figures are properly organized in order to be easy to understand and representative for the readers. The overall organization of the work is adequate.
Validity of the findings
Each work described is analyzed considering its strenghts and weaknesses.
Comments for the author
The manuscript by Liao and colleagues is valuable. Some minor revisions concerning the language has to be addressed prior to publication: - there are mistakes in lines 135, 161, 186, 188, 298,... In general some careless mistakes can be found throughout the manuscript, please double check the work and fix all of them - TMJ acronym has to be defined in extenso at least once - on line 273 esophagus is wrongly reported as an organ containing cartilages!! If the authors intend cricoid cartilage close which the esophagus starts they should consider that cricoid is anatomically included in larynx. Cite this review as
