Review History A comparative study of root canal shaping using protaper universal and protaper next rotary files in preclinical dental education To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

•There is unclear, ambiguous language in some sections. •What is/are statistical test(s) that was/ were used in this study? should be mentioned in background, methods, and results •What is deformation? Need to be defined •Figures should be included (shaping ability study)

The two different systems (PTU and PTN) were used by different groups of students and this hinder the power of this study, it is indirect comparison with unnecessary variables.

The study was well designed and professional english language was used (Certificate of editing and proofreading was attached). Research question well defined, relevant & meaningful. The first author has experience in this field. Even so, the authors must be controlled the references. (for example; authors name in the text ; in a study by Alemann et al. (2017), and in the references ; Alemam AAH, Dummer PMH, Farnell DJJ. 2017, are different.) As a result, this article is acceptable after correction of subject above. Cite this review as

The author should mention the importance of using NiTi rotary instrumentation by the undergraduate dental student with more details, the author can refer to this study: Comparative study of root-canal shaping with stainless steel and rotary NiTi files performed by preclinical dental students Technology and Health Care 23 (3), 257-265

Was the participation of students in this study mandatory or voluntary? is there any acceptance form for participation in this study? is there any relation between students grades in this course and participating in this study All these points should be mentioned in the materials and method section

The manuscript provides a good idea but needs several modifications to be more valuable work where I have the following comments; Introduction section: 1. The author should mention the importance of using NiTi rotary instrumentation by the undergraduate dental student with more details and the author can refer to this study: Comparative study of root-canal shaping with stainless steel and rotary NiTi files performed by preclinical dental students Technology and Health Care 23 (3), 257-265 Methods section Was the participation of students in this study mandatory or voluntary? is there any acceptance form for participation in this study? is there any relation between students grades in this course and participating in this study All these points should be mentioned in the materials and method section The students had applied root canal treatment to a total of 12 extracted human teeth in the phantom laboratory what is the instrumentation technique do the student used stainless steel file with step back technique Canal straightening and the incidence of ledges were assessed on digital images with AutoCAD 2007. This part needs more expansion Discussion section Narayanaraopeta & AlShwaimi (2015) announced that five of the six schools employed NiTi rotary instruments. Please this statement needs more details and clarification Muñoz et al. (2014) showed that students also engaged in satisfactory shaping via reciprocal movement with a single file. but in your study, you used rotary systems. and you could improve your study by comparing a rotary system with a reciprocating single file system These researchers assessed the amount of straightening of the channels prepared by the third-year students, who had no experience with the rotary instruments, in the extracted molar teeth. Is there no effect of the difference between dentin in the root canal and resin in simulated root canals on the apical transportation you can refer to the following article: Assessment of apical transportation caused by nickel-titanium rotary systems with full rotation and reciprocating movements using extracted teeth and resin blocks with simulated root canals: A comparative study In severely curved canals, the master apical size should be smaller than #30; Where is the reference? In our study, the incidence rates of deformation and fracture were 17% for PTU and 9% for PTN. Can you explain this difference in fracture rate between PTU and PTN Ledges occurred in 19% of the canals prepared with PTU, whereas ledges formed in 4% of PTN cases. Does swaggering motion in PTN has any effects in reducing ledges Within the limitations of this study, What are the limitations of your study? and what is your suggestion to improve teaching and using NiTi systems by undergraduate dental students Cite this review as
