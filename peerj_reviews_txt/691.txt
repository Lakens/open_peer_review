Review History The physiologic and therapeutic role of heparin in implantation and placentation To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
The reviewers found merit in your paper but also lack of practical information that preclude publishing it in its present form. The manuscript will be improved by addition of information on clinical data obtained by randomized controlled or observational studies and indications about the use of heparin in clinical practice during pregnancy. Practical implications of the in vitro findings should be discussed.

Comments for the author
label_cfta_1
The manuscript is well written. Authors should add a final paragraph reporting - indications to use of heparins in clinical practice during pregnancy - practical implications of the reported in vitro findings, in terms of future research or future clinical trials. Cite this review as

Basic reporting
label_br_2
The authors report on mechanisms possibly involved in the improvement of implantation and placentation by heparins.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
This is not a systematic review, it seems a "narrative" review, but this is not clearly reported by authors. If I have correctly understood the Scope of the journal this type of article is not acceptable.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
This review focuses on the role played by heparins in implantation and placentation. Data are properly reported and the paper is well written. However, the review could be improved by adding information on clinical data from RCTs or observational studies.
