label_br_2
The manuscript needs more careful editing. It is very poorly prepared. Literature references, significant background of the work are provided. Article structure, figures, tables and additional data are fine. However, reference list is very poorly prepared. Uniformity in format, complete details such as page numbers are missing. The manuscript is self contained with relevant results to hypotheses tested.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
The research is original and fits with the aims and scope of the journal. Research question is defined well and meaningful. Role of small RNAs in polyploidization is less studied and hence the work fills a wll identified knowledge gap. Variations among the F2 lines analyzed are interesting. However, needs better discussion. The techical part of the work such as experments and ethical standards are high. Methods described are sufficient for replication. The field trails for observing the flowering time should be elaborated in materials and methods and discussed in detail in discussion section.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
Some of the conclusions made are blunt statements. Authors have to discuss in detail about the molecular mechanism of flowering, role of small RNAs and the target transcription factors and other genes regulated by transcription factors.

The manuscript entitled 'Analysis of small RNA changes in different Brassica napus synthetic allopolyploids' is a good work overall but suffers from some serous issues and some minor issues detailed below. The manuscript needs careful editing and also elaborated discussion. Major points: 1. The procedure followed to separate and confirm siRNA from other sRNA in the sequence reads. Is it the usual procedure? Any reference? 2. There are many blunt statements in results and discussion. It has to be elaborated with literature support. Eg. Line 148. What is meant by method of comparision? 3. Lines 157-158. Polyploidization and hybridization caused changes in number of miRNA. Why it should change? Relate to gene regulation during the physiological process with reference. 4. Line 180. How could protein phosphorylation contribute to heterosis? Elaborate with cited references on what is happening to proteins during heterosis and to which proteins. 5. Line 190. What did Fu etal 2016a said? How you state it is consistent with that? Elaborate. 6. Lines 201-204. Number of up-regulated siRNA expression in F2 compared to number of down-regulated siRNA expression indicate what? Why should there be a difference in differential expression of siRNAs amoung F2 plants? This could have been discussed better. 7. Lines 211-221. Observation of flowering time in F2 plants in field trial is not enough to support the argument about role of transcription factors and their targeting miRNAs. A simple RT-PCR to confirm the suppression of AP2-like and AP2 transcription factors would have given a strong support. 8. Line 241. Inconsistent and consistent are not appropriate words. It can be used only when same samples are repeated and when we get different results compared to previous reports. It is obvious that when the subspecies used are different, the results are going to be different from previous reports. There is no surprise. There is no point in arguing consistent or inconsistent. 9. Lines 242-248. This should have been discussed in a much better way. Gene expression and regulation during initial stages of allopolyploid formation - needs referenes to support detailed arguments. 10. Line 252. miRNAs do not regulate sequence of target site. They complement and thus regulate the expression of target molecules (mRNA). 11. Lines 253-255. Unclear. miRNA gene undergoes mutation thereby the sequence changes and loses its complementarity to target mRNA. This can have an impact on the phenotype indirectly or may involve in evolution of new phenotype. Due to mutation in miRNA, its target site (mRNA) may not change or get lost. 12. Lines 265-268. Why there should be difference between different materials of same generation and different materials of different generation? Give a scientific argument or at least a speculation. 13. Lines 271-282. A given miRNA may have many target mRNAs. Since one of the target is a transcription factor involved in regulating flowering time (as per literature / database), the flowering observed cant be just correlated with teh miRNA-mRNA combination. It needs validation. Include discussion on what are the genes regulated by this transcription factor and how many of them are involved in control of flowering time. 14. References are poorly prepared. Journal names are not given in full. Abbreviated journal names are not used in many references. Volume number or page numbers missing in most of the references. There are many typographical errors in reference list. Other minor points: 1. Line 65-66. Avoid use of 'means of molecular biology'. Small RNA is a molecule and the approach is a molecular biological tool. Change the words appropriately. 2. Line 74. 'Stable synthesis B. napus'? 3. Line 77. Change 'are not been' to 'have not been' 4. Line 83. Remove the word 'polyploid' 5. Lines 88-89. Embryo rescue and in vitro hybridization. How this was performed. Elaborate the methodology so that it can be replicated by other researchers. 6. Line 93. Change to 'and flower size' 7. Line 99. Quit and Agilent 2100 should be within brackets? Include city and country name as well. 8. Line 110. Check spelling of the word 'sequences'. 9. Line 114. Change to 'miRNA'. 10. Line 114. Instead of 'we got', use the words 'were obtained' at the end of the sentence. 11. Line 144. What is meant by different materials? plants or tissues? 12. Line 145. 'on average, average' 13. Line 155. Change to 'identified' 14. Line 156. Change to 'known' 15. Lines 162-165. What is bra-miRNA and bol-miRNA? 16. Line 173. 'cell cellular component'?? 17. Lines 163-171. 'Non-additively activated'. Explain. 18. Line 188. Change to 'indicate' 19. Line 192. Change to 'followed by AACC6' 20. Line 192. 'number of parents' or 'number in parents'? 21. Lines 238, 239. Change to Fu et al. (2016a). 22. Line 255. A. thaliana... the statement has to be rephrased. 23. Line 257. Add year to Li et al. 24. Line 259. 'high propotion of miRNAs were non-additively expression' - poor English. Where found to be non-additively expressed? 25. Lines 260-261. Which genes? Examples? 26. Line 263. Add year to Fu et al. 27. Line 264. What is meant by non-expressively expressed?? 28. Line 269. 'performance of field traits'?? 29. Lines 273, 277, 278. 'non-additive expression' 'non-additively expressed'. Check. 30. Line 274. There are hundreds of field traits. What is again meant by consistent? 31. Line 297. 'Predecessors generally use..."?? 32. Lines 283-300. Discuss in a better way. 33. Line 302. Check the spelling of author (auther). Contribution should have lower case c. 34. Line 304. 'contributed to the' is repeated appearing two times. 35. Line 318. Data Accessiblity Statement.

Comments for the author
The submitted manuscript contains some original and useful information. The submitted work has studied the sRNA changes and regulatory patterns of allopolyploids with reference to the flowering trait. The experimental design is good and the results are reliable. The manuscript is clearly written. Hence this work is suitable for Publication with following minor corrections. Abstract: Abstract is comprehensive and informative. Introduction : Introduction is clear enough to introduce the reader. The aim and objective of the study are clear. However the authors failed to write why they select the sRNA changes and regulatory patterns of flowering trait and it's importance. Materials and Methods : The research methodology are clearly written and appropriate. Results : Results are clear with supporting evidences. The presentations of Figures are with good quality. However the Legends for Fig.3c and 3d are looks same. Please check the legends. Line No: 218 Write the full form for 'FT" Discussion : Discussions are sound and enough. Minor concern : Spelling mistakes Line No: 156 the word Known is misspelled. Line No : 188 the word indicate is misspelled Cite this review as
