Review History Seasonal trends in the condition of nesting females of a solitary bee: wing wear, lipid content, and oocyte size To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

This is an excellent article on the physiology of an important native pollinator. The authors have done a stellar job in terms of both experimental design and scientific reporting. Further studies will be needed to fully assess the effects of wing wear and lipid stores on ovarian development and bee reproductive success, but this manuscript is an important first step to launch future research.

The manuscript by O'Neill et al., describes how changes the wing wear, lipid content and oocyte size of M. rotundata, in order to correlate them with reproductive performance and the fitness in a field of an important "solitary bee pollinated crop", alfalfa. Based on the results, beside the normal and always present environmental factors, as for example wheather or food source, a number of not completely controllable seasonal factors are present and can affects the performance of the pollinators. Indeed, there was a negative correlation between wing wear and oocyte size. This study, in my opinion, can add more and interesting information about this pollinator to take into account for its managment for pollination service, even if is not in deep understood the degree of seasonal changes that can affect fitness and performances.
