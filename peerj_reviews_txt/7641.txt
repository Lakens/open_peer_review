Review History Cloning, phylogenetic research, and prokaryotic expression study of the metabolic detoxification gene EoGSTs1 in Empoasca onukii Matsuda To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The manuscript was significantly improved and now suitable to publish in PeerJ. I would recommend accepting this article. Minor: make a space between the and multiscan in the line 179 In line 162, authors wrote "conducted PVDF transmembrane". Please correct. IS that PVDF transfter? Cite this review as

The revised manuscript titled “Cloning, sequence analysis and phylogenetic research study of the metabolic detoxification gene, EoGSTs1, in Empoasca onukii Matsuda” by Zhang et al has reported most of my concerns. However, I have still found many grammatical errors, spelling mistakes and ambiguous sentences that need to be corrected (especially in the method section). Therefore, the manuscript needs serious attention in the writing part, before being considered for the publication. Authors could consider taking help from any native english speaker for the language correction in the manuscript.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
Experiments are well executed. Please consider reducing the number of figures by combining figures and as different parts of same figure wherever possible, it would help the future readers of the manuscript to understand it better and will make the manuscript aesthetically sound. Some more comments: Line 135: Correct the name of restriction enzyme. Line 136: Replace clone strain with cloning strain Line 132: Revise the method section as it is poorly written and contains number of grammatical errors and typos. Line 318: Remove “an”

Comments to authors -English language need to have relook for newly added paragraphs to the draft and correct where ever required -Line 44, change enzymes assay to enzyme activity assay -Remove common in line 45 -Mention at first instance recombinant EoGSRs1 (rEoGSTs1) and Use it as a synonym throughout the manuscript where ever your mentioning recombinant protein or recombinant enzyme. -Use of unique synonym EoGST vs EoGSTs1?? Throughout the manuscript -Line 122, correct -3 ul -Mention Top10 strain correctly. Ecoli top10?? -Line 180/181, use term primary antibody instead of first antibody, secondary HRP antibody instead second antibody -Line 319, Protein gel?? Means SDS-PAGE? Cite this review as

The manuscript titled “Cloning, sequence analysis and phylogenetic research study of the metabolic detoxification gene, EoGSTs1, in Empoasca onukii Matsuda” by Zhang et al. reports the characterization of glutathione S-transferase from Empoasca onukii. The study is providing insights for the future use of EoGST protein for the management of chemical resistance in leafhoppers. The manuscript is overall well-structured and focused. The findings are interesting and will be utilized by the scientific community. However most of the conclusions are presented based on the bioinformatic evidences only.

Introduction, materials and methods and discussion section is well written and is clearly providing all the necessary details. The experiments are well executed.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_5
I have only minor concerns, Result section in few places is containing the part of the method that should go with materials and methods section, for e.g., Line 128, Please move all the methods part in result under methods section. Please comment on the activity of EoGST. Authors should consider doing activity assay of EoGST in vitro. Please elaborate the figure legends. Mainly figure 1, 5 and 7.

In this manuscript entitled “Cloning, sequence analysis and phylogenetic research study of the metabolic detoxification gene, EoGSTs1, in Empoasca onukii Matsuda” authors cloned full-length cDNA of EoGSTs1 from Empoasca onukii Matsuda and used several in silico tools to perform some analysis to reveal characteristics. Manuscript is short but well written. This is not the first instance of cloning GST from Empoasca onukii Matsuda. An 823 bp of GST cDNA was already been reported in PMID: 30296272. Although authors made effort to clone EoGSTs1 and for some in-silico analysis of the GST protein, this manuscript lacks novelty and biological validation by sufficient experiments to publish in “PeerJ”.

1)This is not the first instance of cloning GST from Empoasca onukii Matsuda. An 823 bp of GST cDNA was already been reported in PMID: 30296272. 2)In Line 81-82, authors mentioned that they performed screening of transcriptome data to identify differentially expressed genes upon chemical treatment. But authors didn’t show any analysis in the manuscript. Need explanation. 3)Why authors used specific concentration of thiamethoxam and time point. They could have showed some kinetics of expression of GST at least. 4)Did authors submit the sequence in public database? 5)Authors could have purified and characterized the protein which would makes manuscript acceptable. some in vitro detoxification studies can also be done? 6)Line 66, Expand DEM 7)Ref missing in line 172.
