Review History The roles of STP and LTP in synaptic encoding To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

This is an excellent, focused paper on the ability of short-term potentiation (STP), but not LTP, to modulate the frequency response of bursts of high-frequency synaptic transmission. Because much information in the hippocampus in vivo may be transmitted by high-frequency bursts of pyramidal cell activity, this specific property of STP may be highly relevant to short and intermediate forms of memory. The paper is well-performed and described. One minor rhetorical issue in the Discussion is that I wonder whether STP is really an “extreme example” of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Testing does affect STP strength, as the authors have previously shown and reproduced here, but in a predictable, not in a random way. Cite this review as
