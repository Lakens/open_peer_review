Review History The final spawning ground of Tachypleus gigas (Müller, 1785) on the east Peninsular Malaysia is at risk: a call for action To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

I like the revised version. It is much better structured now. There are still some flaws that could be easily addressed before publications: Introduction The last paragraph of the introduction is still really bad. It has bad grammar and mixes present with past tense. It also lacks any clear description of the objectives. Your paper investigates the relations between nesting behavior and environmental as well as anthropogenic factors, and tries to identify major drivers that influence the nesting. That is not stated anywhere in the manuscript. Discussion What are possible functional explanations for that relationship between nesting and NO3? This should be discussed. The authors suggest an MPA’s for the investigated area. But this may be unrealistic and also may take a long time. The knowledge from this analysis should enable the authors to give more specific advise to the authorities with regard to identifying the most harmful anthropogenic activities in the area and to which extend these should be regulated. Minor issues l. 102 & 409: avoid the term ’long-term observation’ – this is used when data are collected over >20 years l. 365: clam => calm l. 418: the statement on over exploitation is not supported by any data/analysis

Pass Except the Pair-wise statistical variations. Is it one-way ANOVA? I have doubt on this statistical analysis. Require clarification. Otherwise suggest to remove table 6.

The manuscript is well organized and presents valuable information about the spawning ground of Tachypleus gigas. However, some modification and further analysis are required before publication. 1. Information regarding the Ph.D. proposal (lines 133-137) seems unnecessary. 2. I suggest using abbreviations for environmental vectors in PCA graphs. the positions of environmental vectors are indistinct particularly in figure 3, where the most of the environmental vectors are clumped on the right side of the graph.

From the PCA BiPlots (Figure 4) it is obvious that some environmental factors are correlated with each other (especially sediment parameters). Therefore, it is recommended to perform Pearson correlation between environmental parameters before concluding about significant environmental variables, as some environmental factors may affect indirectly.

This is a potentially very interesting paper describing the temporal variation of spawning activity in the Malaysian horseshoe crab T. gigas and making associations to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The language and structure of the ms is very good, but I have some principal concerns about the design of the analysis and the interpretation of the results. First, the ms does not state any clear hypothesis (l. 106-112), which makes the presentation of the results and discussion unfocused and without any clear outcome. One problem with the analysis is that there is so much variation in the overall data set (e.g. season, place, phases), so it is very difficult to analyse correlations between the variation in spawning and the environmental features. At the same time some of the important environmental pressures that may be responsible for the severe drop in abundance of individuals may not have been recorded (e.g. fishing activity, construction activity). The only obvious anthropogenic driver with relation to the measured variables is the sand mining. Hence, the statistical tests perform weak when trying to identify those conditions and factors that are optimal for TG. The only clear pattern I see is that Phase 1 is very different from 2 and 3, both regarding number of females and regarding water quality. Sediment quality however, seems to be different among all three phases, so it may not be so clear to link this to the disappearance of females. Also, I would expect the sediment characteristics to affect the number of nests/eggs but not the number of females. However, the number of eggs has increased from phase 1/2 to phase 3. Again, what is missing here is a clear causal link between the potential pressure, the measured variable and the analysis of variance. I also find it difficult to overview the ANOVA results from the text descriptions. Please consider moving all statistical test results into table(s), e.g. with columns for variables and rows for phase-pairs that are compared against each other. It is confusing to use 1, 2, 3 for both sites and phases. I suggest changing the site description to site A, B, C. Spell check for ‘carbs’ vs ‘crabs’ I still find the ms intriguing and a potentially very critical contribution to the field of horseshoe crab conservation. In conclusion I suggest major revision of the manuscript.

It is about one of the authors registration for Ph. D and getting the permission for field work. Thus I suggest to remove this paragraph.

Results Spawning population and nesting Authors have mentioned that the full moon observations revealed higher egg yield (7,261 eggs in 48 nests) than to the new moon observations (1,693 eggs in 16 nests). But P value shows that there is no significant deference in egg counts during full moon and new moon.Also Fig. 2B doesn’t show above variation. Graphical representation of results is not very clear in 2A, B and C. I suggest to use egg count/nest for all A, B and C graphs. Draw line graphs for 2C and D Sediment characteristics Results of One –way ANOVA are not clear.
