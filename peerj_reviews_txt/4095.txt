Review History SDMtoolbox 2.0: the next generation Python-based GIS toolkit for landscape genetic, biogeographic and species distribution model analyses To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
Dear Authors, Thank you for your thorough and thoughtful responses to the reviewer’s comments. I am returning the MS to you so that you can implement some of the small edits suggested by reviewer 2. With respect to the use of “Thou shall” the choice is yours, although I too would prefer to see alternate wording. I look forward to your revision. Sincerely, Tomas Hrbek

This manuscript provides detailed documentation concerning the release of a new version of SDMtoolbox: 2.0, and will be an excellent contribution to PeerJ. Following the edits and suggestions of the reviewers, the authors have greatly improved the manuscript and the associated “Getting Started” and “ User Guide” for the toolbox. They also made changes to the script to correct previous errors. I fundamentally disagree on the continued use of "The 10 commandments of SDMtoolbox 2.0", especially by beginning each line with "Thou shall". This is, in my opinion, the only unprofessional part of the document. I have no further edits or suggestions.

I have minor comments. The discussion section reads well but other sections need additional work. Line 111, sentence not clear, rewrite. Line 122, sentence not clear, particularly use of the verb visualizing Line 130, incorrect use of punctuation marks. Delete the colon and all semi-colons, and replace the last phrase with "to name a few". Or rewrite. Line 155, a coma is need after OR. Or rewrite Line 203, delete (i.e mean annual temperature) 79 scripts in the main document vs 78 in the user guide. Which is correct? User guide table of content still refers to page 215 Cite this review as

Major Revisions
Dear Authors, I have now received two reviews, one minor and one major revisions. I am recommending major revision. Reviewer number 1 found bugs in your scripts and these will need to be correct (the scripts need to run without throwing errors). Reviewer number two had suggestions on orthography of the MS, and reviewer one the inclusion of page numbers in the User Guide. I would appreciate if you addressed the issue of errors and thoroughly test your scrips (I know this is Python, but different operating systems, functions are sensitive to differences in end of line characters among operating systems, etc.) and implemented the reviewers’ comments and suggestions before returning a revised MS. I look forward to your revision. Sincerely, Tomas Hrbek

This manuscript provides detailed documentation concerning the release of a new version of SDMtoolbox: 2.0. As the use of geospatial analyses is continually increasing in many ecological fields, the development and introduction of new tools such as this that can be used for robust study design is highly important. Generally, this manuscript and the associated “Getting Started” and “ User Guide” are clear and well written. However, I have provided detailed edits in the attached document that can improve organization and clarity of the manuscript, getting started, and user guide documents. The User Guide needs page #s to match the Table of Contents. Additionally, some of the language is unprofessional and needs to be changed as I noted in the detailed edits. Overall, the User Guide was straight-forward, however I received some toolbox errors when following the User Guide as closely as possible, and I have included the error logs for reference. I think that if a better description of the files that are being used for each step and their relative location are added, these errors may be avoided. Finally, there is a lot of detail in the User Guide concerning Maxent, however a description of the new Clog Log function is absent; this should be added.

Comments for the author
Reviewer 1: SDMtoolbox 2.0: The next generation python-based GIS toolkit for landscape genetic, biogeographic and species distribution model analyses. I congratulate the authors for creating and updating SDMtoolbox 2.0. The toolbox aids the automation of rigorous spatial analyses; thus, it is highly desirable among geospatial modelers and conservation professionals. My recommendation is to accept with minor revision. I encourage the authors to make suggested changes and resubmit for publication. Here are my comments. Detailed Comments Line 36, a total of 79 scripts Line 40, future climates, Line 55, a series of Line 56, complicated spatial analyses in ArcMap (ESRI) and python Line 55, line 108, and others, please write abbreviations in full at first use. Line 74, Rewrite the last sentence. Line 89, e.g., Line 101, importance of Bias files in Maxent Line 117, delete brackets, ..tools batch project or define projections of input rasters…. Line 118, delete ‘aims to’, another set of tools facilitate batch exportation of images or aid in RGB band visualization of multiband rasters Line 156, rewrite. Sentence starting As following is not grammatically correct. Line 163, make sure all figures are mentioned in the text. Line 164,insert ‘in’, it can be done in several ways Line 191, “lower levels”, did you mean resulting from lower regularization multiplier values Line 196, delete “(i.e. Bio1)” Line 205, that is more sensitive details of ? sentence appears incomplete Line 207, “which subsequently is implement in the”, sentence appears incorrect Line 217, tests and evaluates? Line 241, if the journal allows this should be written as footnote or in the acknowledgment section. Please follow correct citation style (sometimes publication year is within brackets and other times it is not) I installed the tool using the software installation guide provided in the supplemental material. The user guide needs some editing as well. Example, first sentence needs the preposition “to”. It should read like “designed to automate”. The second paragraph needs a comma immediately after SDMtoolbox 2.0. Table of contents lists page 215 while the document is only 95 pages. General comments: Line 213, the latest maxent default combination is: L, Q, P, H which appears to be more appropriate than the previous maxent versions that included all of them (i.e, L,Q,P,H and T). Are the users able to use this new maxent default combination in SDMtoolbox 2.0? The methods section is very brief, can the authors expand the methods section a little bit. ESRI is an institution that frequently changes its software versions. Given this fact, what is the authors long-term plan to keep SDMtoolbox running on new ArcGIS software versions? Can SDMtoolbox become a standalone tool? Cite this review as
