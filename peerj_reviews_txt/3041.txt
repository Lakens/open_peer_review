Review History Tartrazine induces structural and functional aberrations and genotoxic effects in vivo To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

There are still spacing problem throughout, it will not suitable for your journal in the present format. In the reference list also many spacing problems and most one are not in the journal format. so it need through revision carefully. Cite this review as

Minor Revisions
Our reviewers are generally pleased with the scientific content of your manuscript. Please address the remaining concerns, specifically: from reviewer #2 "There are many previous reports pertaining the toxicity of tartrazine in animal system then what is the novelty of the present work? In your study animals were orally given tartrazine 7.5mg/kg b.wt. (dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water) daily for 30 days. Is all animals alive till the 30th day? is any other health problems observed in the mice during this period when compared to the control group? Out of the 10 mice studied how much are subjected to further biochemical, histological and genotoxic studies?" from reviewer #3: -discuss/compare your results with those of Saxena and Sharma (DOI: 10.4103/0971-6580.172286) "Why did you use only one dose of tartrazine, and very low. In literature higher doses of tartrazine were used. " The manuscript contains many typographical errors, several of which have helpfully been highlighted by the reviewers, and which should also be corrected before acceptance. Review-level comments by the Editor: - Please state the rationale behind the choice of your biochemical markers. Were any addition biochemical markers measured and found to be unchanged? If so, please include them in Table 1. - I think table 1 would be more readable if no abbreviations were used. - Please state the frequency of abnormal histological features in each group of animals. Further, was the researcher who performed the histological observations "blinded" with regard to the origin of the samples? if so, please state that. If not, please perform blinded comparisons of morphological features (with data from several animals from each group). in the discussion, please state the tartrazine concentrations used in the other studies. As mentioned by reviewer #3, you used very low concentrations but still observed toxic effects, whereas some studies did not observe toxicity with much higher doses. You should clearly state these discrepancies, and possibly suggest ways to explain/reconcile these results. line 292: the reference for " In addition, tartrazine has been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations in fibroblast cells of Muntiacus muntjac(Mpountoukas et al., 2010)" is wrong. It should be: Chung, K.T., Fulk, E.G., Andrews, A.W., 1981. Mutagenicity testing of some commonly used dyes. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 42, 641–648

At first, I would like to thank you for choosing me as a referee of your distinguished journal, concerning the manuscript entitled ‘Tartrazine induces structural and functional aberrations and genotoxic effects in-vivo. This paper investigated the toxic potential of a synthetic food colorant Tartrazine in animal test system. The topic of research is interesting and nicely designed, however there are several typographical, spacing and language problems throughout the manuscript. Some of the sentences are meaningless which need rephrasing. Hence this manuscript is not acceptable in its present form, needs major revision

I regret to inform you that the manuscript in its present form has been found to have a number of spelling and typographical errors that make comprehension difficult since there is not a space between two words in most cases. The manuscript needs to be carefully checked before publication. Some recent references are missing in the same fild eg. Saxena B, Sharma S. (2015) Food Color Induced Hepatotoxicity in Swiss Albino Rats, Rattus norvegicus. Toxicol Int. 22(1):152-7. doi: 10.4103/0971-6580.172286. No comment No comment
Experimental design
label_ed_5
No comment In the experimental design it will better to include a second dose of tartrazine used. No comment No comment
Validity of the findings
The findings are very interesting. Comparison of these results with other (and this is important) showed that the dose of tartrazine administered in rats was very low and even exert its toxic effect in biochemical markers (Saxena B, Sharma S. (2015) Food Color Induced Hepatotoxicity in Swiss Albino Rats, Rattus norvegicus. Toxicol Int. 22(1):152-7. doi: 10.4103/0971-6580.172286.) No comment No comment No comment
