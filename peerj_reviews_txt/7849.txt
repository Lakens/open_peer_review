Review History HIF inhibitor topotecan has a neuroprotective effect in a murine retinal ischemia-reperfusion model To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
The authors have substantially improved their manuscript and satisfactorily addressed all the reviewers' concerns. However, there is a significant overlap in the text of this manuscript (Materials and Methods) with a recently published paper by the same authors (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261724>). We understand that the same methods are often reused, although there are only so many ways to describe a procedure. The homologous parts, therefore, should be rephrased.

Basic reporting
label_br_3
Overall, the writing is clear and unambiguous. However, some cosmetic changes to the English writing would improve the readability of the manuscript. The background is sufficient, and references are pertinent. Overall the basic reporting is good. The top right panel in Figure 4A (I/R(+)) is too dark. Please adjust the brightness to match the others (unless the authors have a good reason not to).
Experimental design
label_ed_3
The research question is well defined, interesting, and timely. It is true that neuroprotection of RGCs in various retinal diseases is an unmet need in the field. The model employed is relevant, and the data are clean and presented clearly. Methods are written clearly.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
Data are robust, sound, and controlled. Speculation is reasonable.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_3
The authors show data that preventing HIF stabilization provides functional/anatomical rescue in I/R mice. This is a simple, straightforward study and the findings are clear. The topic is timely, and interesting. I have some specific comments: 1. Can the authors comment on the revelance of the findings to human disease. i.e. Relevance of animal model/contribution of ischemia to RGC degeneration in retinal disease. 2. Can the authors comment more about what is known about HIF1a function in RGCs and supporting cells (astrocytes/microglia). Can the authors rule out an involvement of topetecan in astrocytes/microglia/mueller cells? 3. The authors should clarify that HIF1a is active in multiple other retinal cell-types. Can the authors comment if there may be off target effects? Cite this review as

Basic reporting
label_br_4
The article evaluated the neuroprotective role of topotecan, a HIF inhibitor. The language used is clear, not ambiguous. Introduction and background show context. All references used are relevant. The structure of the manuscript is in accordance with the PeerJ standard. The article has an important contribution to ophthalmology. However, my recommendation is that the authors should clarify some points of the study before it is accepted for publication.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
Why did the authors inject topotecan prior to the induction of retinal injury? As it is a possible therapeutic candidate, it would be interesting to evaluate the protective effect of topotecan after induction of the lesion. Please define normal saline. Is it 10% NaCl? Define IOP at first indication (intraocular pressure) - line 79 Which cocktail inhibitor protease was used in this study? Please enter the manufacturer's catalog number Enter manufacturer's catalog number for all kits cited in the study The methods were presented in the sequence in which they were performed? Rearrange the M&M section, if necessary. Was the electrophysiological evaluation done according to the previous literature? Provide a reference, please. Detail the preparation or acquisition of the primers. Inform if the data were tested for statistical normality
Validity of the findings
The results were not discussed correctly. The authors did not relate their findings to previous literature. Please review this section carefully The figures are adequate Standardize the terminology. Please use RGC degeneration (not RGC neurodegeneration) This reviewer understands that further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of HIF as well as its inhibitory drugs. However, speculations would be welcome in the discussion. Review the sentence - "This study suggested that pharmacological HIF inhibition may be candidates for RGC degeneration induced with renal ischemia or high intraocular pressure."
