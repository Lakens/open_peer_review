Review History Stability of commercial glucanase and ß -glucosidase preparations under hydrolysis conditions To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_1
The manuscript by Rosales-Calderon et al. is a clearly written solid report which is appropriate for publication in its present form. The authors demonstrate that protein aggregation combined with non-productive biomass binding is an important feature of cellulase hydrolysis. This finding has practical impacts regarding the use of stabilizers. Their results also suggest that enzyme recycling approaches may not be feasible, since the enzyme released from biomass may be aggregated and inactive.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
The authors combine excellent and well-thought-out experiments to clarify models to elucidating the role of beta-glucosidase aggregation on cellulolytic enzyme activities.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
The results and concepts gleaned from this study will be of interest to scientists working in the field of biomass conversion to biofuels.
