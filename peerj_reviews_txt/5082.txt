Review History Mulch and groundcover effects on soil temperature and moisture, surface reflectance, grapevine water potential, and vineyard weed management To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
This is an interesting paper and both reviewers find it is worth publishing. However there are some concerns on the limitations of the experiment which can be explicitly described. A diagram of the experimental design will be instructive. I also have a question about the possible variation in soil type among treatments? There seems to be no soil analysis taken, at least for the site. Measurement: Need to specific the depth of temperature measurement, surface? Why do mulch treatments raise soil temperature? Organic mulch has a much lower thermal conductivity and thus should reduce temperature variation, i.e. lower soil temperature. Could it be the effect of time of measurement ?

Objectives well stated. Manuscript is well organized and very well written.
Experimental design

The design appears appropriate, although a strip-plot field design might have been more efficient. I do have some concerns about potential interaction among the main effects. These concerns are expressed in the "General Comments" section.

This is a well organized and well written manuscript and should provide Midwestern winegrape growers with additional options for vineyard floor management. I have a few minor editorial suggestions and a few more substantive comments, as follows: I’m unclear on the actual statistical field plot design given the nature of how data are presented in the tables. Authors state that a “randomized factorial design” with 5 intra- and 3-inter-row treatments were used. If a true factorial experiment was established, this would entail 5 x 3 (15) treatments, replicated 4 times = 60 field plots. I would then anticipate that statistical interpretations would include main effects (intra- and inter-row floor treatments), as well as their potential interactions. I failed to find mention of the potential inter- X intra-row interaction in the results or in the tabular data presented. The main effects are presented separately, so I must assume that there were no significant treatment interactions. This should be reported for each dataset. Some of the methodology is unclear. For example, in the discussion of soil water content, we’re informed that each recorded value was an average of three measurements (Line 163). Is that three measures per treatment replicate (3 X 4 reps)? Similarly, how many leaves were sampled for mid-day stem water potential? Authors mention at lines 246-247 that the lack of treatment effects on reflected PAR was unexpected “because there were obvious visual differences among the treatments.” This is also mentioned in the abstract, yet we’re not told how those differences were visually identified. What is the value of the subjective comments? The ecophysiological measures that were taken were helpful in explaining potential vine responses, but the obvious potential responses of vine size (cane pruning weight), shoot vigor, components of yield, and fruit chemistry are all lacking. Presumably those responses are discussed in a companion paper, but it would be more satisfying to see the vine responses in this same paper with the data presented here. Some very minor issues: the work of Giese et al. of 2014 (lines 338-340) was conducted in the Yadkin Valley of NC, not in Virginia. The soil temperature data in Table 2 should have a footnote defining the depth at which the soil temperature was measured. Also – the similarity of the standard errors reported here is suspicious. Line 40: “none of the treatments affected mid-day vine water potential”. How do you know that all treatments didn’t affect mid-day vine water potential the same way? In reality, Table 5 is probably not needed – the results could be discussed in the narrative. Cite this review as

Line 75: REF? especially regarding time requirements to prune and position shoots Line 77: the phrase: “vine balance” is open to wide interpretation.

Line 355: Again…I suggest to defer from the use of “improve vine balance” as an effect or outcome…”reducing vine vigor” is more exact or accurate CONCLUSION: ** Although data was collected on groundcover treatment impact on light interception by the vine canopy (PAR), soil moisture, vine water potential and soil temperature, these parameters were not correlated to vine growth or yield. Groundcover biomass or weed % may have correlated to vine canopy density or pruning weights. Why was vine nitrogen status not measured?** Line 362-364: This is a broad statement that is not supported by your research…you show no pruning weight or yield data that would support it. How can you be sure that the glyphosate intra-row strip is “unnecessary”, if this yield and pruning weight data…is not shown or presented? Most growers would be want to know the effect of a vineyard practice on yield. Line 363-365: the reduction of vineyard labor was not directly supported/substantiated by your results…did you measure it? Was “vine balance” measured? Overall, I recommend refraining from the use of the terms “vine balance” Line 367-369: DELETE: Cool- season grasses are the most practical inter-row groundcovers because they resume growth early in the spring, which facilitates vineyard management tasks by providing a firm footing for tractor and foot traffic. This was not a measured finding of your research.
