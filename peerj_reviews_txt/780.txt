Review History Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by a new multiplex peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization method To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
As you will see, both expert reviewers consider your manuscript a well written technical study that adds valuable approaches to the diagnosis of BV. Both reviewers provide some suggestions for further improvement of the paper. In addition, I would suggest you use the term microbiota rather than flora/microflora.

Basic reporting

The paper is a technical paper. With some minor translational issues, it is well written and concise. The only technical comment I have is the use of the transport media to generate a Nugent slide. Some readers will state that the media may have a dilution effect on the specimen placed on the slide and could potentially alter a Nugent score. They will need a reference to support the approach, or a sentence discussing this as an experimental limitation. My comments-- Abstract: 1st sentence: “infection” to “infections”. 1st sentence: run-on sentence, split into two sentences. 2nd sentence: “gold standard” to “research gold standard”. 3rd sentence: “characteristic” to “characteristics”. Paper: Line 49: “being” to “with”. Line 49: “Fluorescence” to “fluorescence”. Line 52: remove “Nowadays,”. Lines 174 and 175: “sensibility” to “sensitivity”. Table 1 is demographically interesting, but not really necessary to the content of the paper. Table 1: add “With” to “Children”. Delete Table 1 - it is confusing and adds nothing to the paper
