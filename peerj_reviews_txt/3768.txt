Review History Anthropometric, physical function and general health markers of Masters athletes: a cross-sectional study To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The article as a whole is well written using clear and ambiguous language. Although there are some concepts that are "confusing" these do not seem to be purposeful and may be simply author's vast knowledge and involvement with the manuscript. As a whole, the topic seems well research and sufficient background and context is provided for the reader to understand. Overall, the manuscript is well written and provides significant contribution to the pertinent field of study. However, there are several areas where the manuscript could use some clarity.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
Overall the study design is robust and provides meaningful data. The research question is well defined and the authors provide adequate support of their aims, objectives and statistical methods to reach appropriate conclusions. I have provided additional comments throughout the text, which may require some additional information to add clarity.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
The results provided seem to be valid and reliable. However, the results section as described by the authors requires some work to improve clarity for the reader. I would encourage authors to address some of the comments provide to add clarity to some of these points.
Comments for the author

Basic reporting
label_br_4
This manuscript appears to meets all the requirements as set by PeerJ policies and the reporting in accordance with STROBE guidelines. The introduction is too long. This is not a review of the literature. A shorter, more focused introduction to the study would be better. Much of the literature presented could be synthesised with one or two relevant supporting citations. There are some issues with punctuation that need to be addressed. The authors need to ensure punctuation throughout the document is correct.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
Is the BIA instrument used in the study the same as that used for the Australian reference population? There are no cut points or thresholds for any of the outcome measures. How was sarcopenia evaluated, ie using height adjusted measures, relative or absolute measures of skeletal muscle mass, or fat free mass? What are the expected thresholds for the ‘sarcopenic gait speed’? What are the reference values for handgrip?
Validity of the findings
In the Results, I am not sure why a percentage for differences in BMI is used with the reference population? Could the kg/m2 differences be included? The discussion was acceptable, but the authors state in line 235 that 49% of the cohort were ‘underweight or had normal body composition’. What percentage were underweight?
