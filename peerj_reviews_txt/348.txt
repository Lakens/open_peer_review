Comments for the author
label_cfta_2
The authors are weighing-in on a topic of current controversy and importance in invasive species (and Caribbean coral reef) ecology by providing an additional analyses of a dataset used to examine the relationship between invasive lionfish and native predators. It is this reviewer's opinion that the scientific process is at its best when these controversies play-out with rapid publication that is unfettered by attempts to suppress valid but contrary analyses. For this system in particular, time will tell. The authors have done an excellent job of describing opposing studies in this article and are careful to point out weaknesses in the data and conclusions. The writing is clear and to the point, and was a pleasure to read. Cite this review as
