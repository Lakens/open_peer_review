Review History Changes in pigment, spectral transmission and element content of pink chicken eggshells with different pigment intensity during incubation To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor comments: 1)Abstract: "…region (small, equator and…" should probably read "…region (small pole, equator and…" 2)Abstract: sentence starts with "And": "…light. And the transmittance…" 3)Abstract: undefined abbreviation: "…the PT of the…" 4)Line 37: Keywords are far too vague/general - use more specific words, e.g. eggshell pigment, animal husbandry, chicken rearing, etc. 5)Line 70 (and throughout): "…percent transmittance of light (PT)…"…formally, transmittance is a ratio thus has values from 0 to 1. For percentage values, better to use the term "transmission". 6)Line 85: "…regions (small, equator…" should be "…regions (small pole, equator…" 7)Line 86: "…<U+0394>E represents the chrominance difference value…" – this would be better defined as the "CIE <U+0394>E colour distance", chrominance can have a distinct meaning, different to that used here. 8)Line 87-89: "L* represents the white and the black of the sample, with the increase and the decrease in the value representing slanting white and black, respectively;"… L is luminance or brightness. This sentence should be rephrased, as should the following sentences to use a different term to the rather confusing "slanting". Values a and b represent colour values along the red-green and yellow-blue opponent axes, respectively. 9)Table 1 – would probably be sufficient to give values to 1 decimal place. 10)Figure1 – probably unnecessary. If kept, change "date line" to "data line" Cite this review as
