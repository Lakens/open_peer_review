Review History Mental practice in isolation improves cervical joint position sense in patients with chronic neck pain: a randomized single-blind placebo trial To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Thanks for the opportunity to review this interesting manuscript. This is a well designed clinical trial that provided importants considerations for the biomedical field. Please, consider the following issues/comments according to the presented manuscript: ABSTRACT -Please, consider add subheadings to the abstract. INTRODUCTION -Paragraph from line 40 to 55: Please, a phrase linking sentral sentization to motor control alterations would be useful at the end of tis paragraph (please, reference this paargraph appropiately). METHODS -The study was adequately designed and registered prospectively at clinicaltrials.gov. -References to support inclusion and exclusion criteria would be useful. In addition, the Declaration of helsinki should be cited. -Randomization, blinding and interventions were well-detailed. -Reliability coefficients and minimum detectable changes were adequately provided for the primary outcome. -Reliability coefficients need to be provided for some secondary outcomes tools such as Tampa scale, NDI and level of physical activity. -A sample size calculation is lacking. Please, provide this calculation or if it is not possible, please, include this issue in limitations and detail this manuscript as a pilot study. RESULTS -Tables and figures were well presented and provided useful information. DISCUSSION -Please, consider to dicuss about some future studies comparing AO and MI with other interventions such as dry needling or ischemic compression of myofascial trigger points (Acupunct Med. 2019 Jun;37(3):151-163. doi: 10.1177/0964528419843913) and mobilization of the upper cervical region (J Oral Rehabil. 2019 Feb;46(2):109-119. doi: 10.1111/joor.12733) to improve cervical motor control in subjects with non-specific neck pain.
