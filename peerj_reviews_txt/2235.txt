Review History Fast men slow more than fast women in a 10 kilometer road race To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
The two reviewers and I were happy with most aspects of your study and submitted manuscript; especially as it did not just concentrate on physiological processes that may underlie the gender difference. Please amend to the reviewers comments in your revised version. Please also note the annotated manuscript from Reviewer 1, which contains extensive feedback

At first glance of the title and abstract I felt the paper may not be of interest and not contribute to the current body of knowledge related to pacing and specifically, gender differences in pacing. However, the paper was well written, argued logically, and presented the methods and results in a way I found drew me in. I was particularly impressed with the Discussion and conclusions. The paper is comprehensive and complete and is a "pass" for me. I hope the attached detailed feedback may enhance the final paper.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
The ethical requirements were met. The research design, methodology and statistical analyses were appropriate.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
As above, the research questions and hypotheses were validly tested, reported and discussed in light of previous research findings. The paper makes an original contribution the current research focused on both pacing and gender differences in pacing.
