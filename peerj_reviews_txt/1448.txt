Review History The effectiveness of sputum pH analysis in the prediction of response to therapy in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
The revised manuscript address most of the concerns from the reviewers. I have a general concern: Supposing the majority of patients are from Japan, is there any necessary to discuss about the similar cohort from different ethnic group or genetic group. Additonally, the results section is a little short. I would recommend to combine the results and discussion together if possible. The conclusion is neat. It will be better to highlight the main discovery from your study.

Comments for the author
I have a few concerns as below: 1) It will be better to specify the exact clinical application in conclusion section, not just mention the pH analysis is useful. For example, For a specific age group or gender, this method is useful. 2) Please specify why use MedCalc for the statistical analysis. What is the advantage of this tool comparing to other open source software. 3) Because the individual difference of samples is too big, it is not appropriate to use one-way ANOVA. 4) Because the sample size is small, the conclusion may be not sure.
