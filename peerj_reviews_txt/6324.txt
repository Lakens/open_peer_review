The authors should be adding more references about how to increase the functional compounds by agronomical/breeding/etc technicals in their part of the review. Cite this review as

Comments on manuscript # 30985 " Recent updates on metabolite composition and medicinal benefits of mangosteen plant" by Aizat et. al. The author compiled the updated literature about the Mangosteen plant’s medicinal and other research based benefits in a review-nice compilation of all the data at one place. Following things need to be addressed in the MS. 1.Best thing about this review-The literature was nicely summarized with respect to all the extracts or compounds extracted from the Mangosteen plant up to date. But, the Figure 2-publication record over the years is making no scientific knowledge improvement. I would suggest, author should make a figure showing the different forms of extracts obtained from the Mangoosteen (plant or a fruit) and then all the well characterized compounds from each extract, if any. 2.Related to comment 1, also author can give another figure- very well characterized compounds, e.g., alpha-, beta- , gamma-mangostin, and Xanthones- their structures, if known? 3.Table 1: Author summarized the studies as different categories like anti-cancer, anti-diabetic… excellent job. To make it more effective for all the researchers working in the related area- separate table for in-vivo studies could be even more effective in highlighting the importance of the extracts/compounds for a particular purpose with known dose of the compound/extract used. The paper is technically sound and well written in nice English. Comments above- will make the MS better. Cite this review as

17- October-2018 Journal: Peer J Manuscript ID: Title: Recent updates on metabolite composition and medicinal benefits of mangosteen plant Authors: Wan Mohd Aizat, Faridda Hannim Ahmad-Hashim, Normah Mohd Noor Dear Editor: The authors have investigated the chemical compositions and medicinal benefits of mangosteen plant. The authors present a sufficient interesting review and thus I accept this review for publication after minor revision. . Hesham El-Seedi, Professor, Division of Pharmacognosy Department of Medicinal Chemistry Uppsala University, Biomedical Centre Box 574, SE-75 123, Uppsala, Sweden Tel: +46-18-4714207 Fax: +46-18-509101 E-mail: hesham.el-seedi@fkog.uu.se   Comments to Author: List of authors: 1-the authors would add the affiliations of co-authors. Abstract: 1-The authors would add some examples of the uses of the plant in folk medicines 2-The authors could show the known medicinal benefits. Introduction: 1- The authors would add references for line 41:45, 48:50 and 51:54 in page 7. 2-The authors would clarify effect of this plant that used in folk medicines compared to other plants or solely. 3-The authors would clarify this sentence (Such claim is not without experimental basis as shown in various studies to characterise the fruit usages as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-hyperglycemic substance). Metabolite composition of mangosteen: 1-The authors would check again the statements without references. 2-The authors would show pharmaceutical properties of the compounds. 3-If the authors would need more information about xanthones, take benefit from the below mentioned reviews: 1-El-Seedi, H.R., El-Barbary, M.A., El-Ghorab, D.M.H., Bohlin, L., Borg Karlson, A.-K., Göransson, U., Verpoorte, R. (2010). Recent insights into the biosynthesis and biological activities of natural xanthones. Current Medicinal Chemistry 17, 854-901. 2-El-Seedi, H.R., El-Ghorab, D.M.H., El-Barbary, M.A., Zayed, M.F., Göransson, U., Larsson, S., Verpoorte, R. (2009). Naturally occurring xanthones; latest investigations: isolation, structure elucidation and chemosystematic significance. Current Medicinal Chemistry 16, 2581-2626. 4- The authors could put the ratio of chemical compounds in figure and general chemical structures. 5-the authors could use (anti-microbial) instead of (Anti-bacteria, anti-fungi and anti-virus) Conclusions: Conclusion should follow the instructions of the journal. References: The authors should follow the instructions of the journal and add DOI and link of journal. Cite this review as
