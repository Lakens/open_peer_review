Writing of the manuscript has been enhanced. Some important minor points should be address.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
As the adverse events in wearing orthokeratology lenses are one of the major concerns, the authors should mention about excluding the cases who experienced any side effects of wearing the lenses. This information is important for the readers to know that the study population was selected partly based on clinical outcomes. Therefore, this should also be discussed as a limitation of this study. The authors also should be advised to acknowledge the potential biases introduced by the selection criteria.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The conclusion should be given a timespan of 12 months as shown in this population.

The English expression need to be further polished, and abbreviations should be completely spelt out when they are first appeared, such as "HOA" and "LOA" in line 30.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
1. The current study is a retrospective study and involved small numbers of people, which may make it less reliable. 2. According to the manuscript, during the one-year follow up, patients worn OK lens at night and removed them before 7 am on the next day (line 74). But authors didn't mention when patients worn OK lens (specific timepoint), so it's not sure if all patients worn OK lens in a fixed duration. 3. For optical quality measurement, pecific measure time wasn't mentioned in methods. Considering OK lens' influence to cornea would tail off with time, the measure time should be fixed to insure its veracity.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
According to the result 3.4.1, astigmatism aberration had no statistical significance at 1 and 3 months, and was remarkablely higher at 12 months after wearing OK lens (line 149-151). But authors didn't explain this phenomenon or give possible mechanism in discussion, which may confuse the readers.

1. Please enhance the English writing of this study. There were many grammar errors. 2. Age of "10.806±2.184" years old was not an appropriate format for age.
Experimental design
label_ed_5
1. Please describe the selection criteria in more details. What eye examinations were done? 2. The "parameters were analyzed before and at 1, 3 and 12 months". However, in Table 1, only data from baseline and 12 months were presented. 3. Please detail the statistical methods used in analyzing the repeated data. What type of student t-test was used? Since Friedman test was a kind of repeated measurement ANOVA, what another ANOVA was used? How was the repeated measurement ANOVA applied to the data? Did the authors checked the distribution of visual acuity and compensating factor? 4. How was the visual acuity measured? 5. As the orthokeratology lenses can pose potentially vision-threatening risk to the subjects, did the authors record any of the adverse events? 6. It is very important to know how the study subjects were selected. 7. Please define the error bars in the figures. 8. The authors should describe the compliance data during the study period. Any other treatments were used? 9. Did the authors obtain data regarding the known visual quality problems of orthokeratology lenses, such as night vision loss, ghosting, halos, and glares? 10. Correction for inflated alpha should be considered.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_5
The authors over-interpreted the results. First, this study spanned for only 12 months. Second, most of the parameters were regressing to baseline values, which indicated that the treatment effect of the lenses was decreasing over time. Third, the authors did not report any side effects and subjective visual quality measurements. Fourth, the selection criteria and selection process were not clear.

This retrospective study provided potentially useful data for the field. However, there are some critical issues to be addressed. Cite this review as

This is a well written, well executed, easy to read manuscript with no grammatical errors. The Figures and tables were self explanatory.
Experimental design
In this study the authors have made significant effort to study the visual quality of OK lenses worn juvenile patients who were followed up for a year. The authors need to include the inclusion and exclusion criteria for recruiting the patients for this study.
Validity of the findings
As it has been mentioned in the discussion "the effect of OK lenses on control of myopia progression is well established", hitherto there is no or very little information is available on their effect on visual quality. This makes this study an unique piece of work, however the discussion part still needs to be re-written to highlight the robustness of this work and its significance to make it more interesting for the readers.

Once again I appreciate the authors for their effort taken to address visual quality of OK lenses. Cite this review as
