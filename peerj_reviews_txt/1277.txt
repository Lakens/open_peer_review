Appeal
Appeal text from authors (7/6/2015): I am writing you regarding the Decision on my Manuscript "Pore size is a critical parameter for obtaining sustained protein release from electrochemically synthesized mesoporous silicon microparticles" (#2015:05:5106:0:0:REVIEW). I understand that PeerJ politics regarding manuscript publication are based on methodological and scientific soundness of the data presented. As you noted in your comments, the decision for the rejection was heavily based on the comments of Reviewer 3. While I deeply respect academic decisions, I think the comments of Reviewer 3 that question the methodological soundness of the work are scientifically flawed. Because of that, I would kindly request you to analyze my responses to Reviewer 3 below, and consider the re-evaluation of this work for publication in PeerJ. Thank you very much in advance. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Marcos Garcia- Responses to REVIEWER 3 (Reviewer in RED, MGF in black): Reviewer #3 (R3): Pastor and coworkers present the controlled preparation of mesoporous silicon based microparticles and their use for controlled release of protein. The synthesis and characterization of material has been previously described by the same authors and it has been here improved in order to tail the pore-size of particles under controlled conditions. Such a material has been then used as support for protein adsorption and controlled delivery, claiming its possible use as medical device. The theoretical design and practical development of this experimental part present a lot of flaws and scientific issues that finally make the entire research work unable to be published in PeerJ. Main issues: • Why did the authors use aCT in its soluble form as model protein? Being a proteolytic enzyme and working in absence of an inhibitor as benzamidine, aCT can undergo to autolysis generating a complex mixture of oligo and polypeptide. This behavior generates a serious problem when the quantification of protein release must be carried out by BCA assay. In fact, the BCA chemistry expects the chelation of copper atoms with protein in an alkaline environment forming a blue colored complex. In this reaction, known as the biuret reaction, peptides containing three or more amino acid residues are involved. The intensity of the color produced is proportional to the number of peptide bonds participating in the reaction. Hence, due to the autolysis of aCT and carrying out experiment for long times (14 days at 37C), the number of peptides available for biuret reaction will increase in a time dependent manner generating a false absorbance increase. Enzymatic activity or other protein detection assays together with the systematic use of SDS-PAGE should have been mandatory. Moreover, in these long-time experiments, a control is always required in order to exclude the autolysis. MGF: I understand that this is the major methodological concern of the referee concerning this manuscript. There are theoretical considerations and experimental evidence that evidence there such methodological problem does not exist as I will describe in the following paragraphs. First, note that the word “chymotripsin” is not mentioned even one time in the whole manuscript, but rather the word “chymotripsinogen (i.e. the acronym aCT)”. This is because we have not worked with the enzyme but rather with the zymogen (pro-enzyme). This zymogen is activated by endopeptidaases in the brush border, and thus it does not transform to the active form under the in vitro release conditions tested here. On a second note, as the reviewer suggest, BCA reaction is based on peptide bonds, and contrary to his reasoning there is no strict proportionality between number of peptide molecules and observance, but rather between total protein mass and absorbance. In fact, if you see the Micro BCA instruction (Life Technologies, Inc.) you will see that this assay is optimized for BSA in 0.5-20 ug/mL range, and they specifically mentioned “… and exhibits very low levels of protein-to-protein variability”. Therefore, in the unlikely scenario were some peptide degradation would occur, the impact over BCA observance would be minimum. Finally, we have experimental evidence that this process as a whole does not occur. When we first used aCT as a model protein for BMP-7 drug delivery devices (Reguera-Nuñez et al. (2014) Biomaterials 35, 2859–2867), we performed this very simple test: we compared the readout in the MicroBCA test between two aCT aliquots of the same sample, one stored for three weeks at 4ºC (fridge, control) and another at 37ºC. Both sample were in PBS +5%BSA, and the test was performed in duplicate. As we expected, there was no significant differences in the BCA readout between the test and control samples. These results obviously support the consistency of the results presented in the present manuscript where we observed sometimes close to 100% of protein recovery, but never more than that as it would be expected if the processes suggested by the reviewer took place. In any case, we plan to introduce some clarifying sentences in the manuscript to explain that aCT is an inactive pro-enzyme loaded here as a predictive protein model for BMP-7 (see last question for further data on this protein selection). • R3: Why did the author not use the BCA protein mass detection for BMP7? In this case, it would have been more useful than ELISA assay. MGF: The protein doses required for therapeutic purposes for morphogens and similar proteins are very small, in the order of micrograms, sometimes even nanograms. This is why concentrations of these samples fall absolutely outside the range for BCA. In fact, ELISA has not only been used by us many times for detecting this kind of molecules (see for instance Reguera-Nuñez et al. (2014) Biomaterials 35, 2859–2867; González-Gómez et al. (2015) Oncotarget 6, 10950–10963; d’ Angelo et al. (2010) Mol. Pharmaceutics 7, 1724–1733), but it is the standard method to measure growth factor and morphogen release for drug delivery devices in the literature. On a separate note, a further advantage of using ELISA as the method is that it ensures that the released protein is at least antigenically active; we know this does not ensure ultimately its bioactivity, but in previous studies we have found good correlation between antigenically active BMP-7 and bioactive BMP-7 (Reguera-Nuñez et al. (2014) Biomaterials 35, 2859–2867). Since BMP-7 is a therapeutic protein, and the device could be used in the future for the design of a pharmaceutical system, we believe that it is beneficial to have preliminary data supporting protein bioactivity after in vitro release. • R3: Why did the authors loaded the proteins in force conditions? I strongly disagree with the claim in L 175-176. By this strategy, it is impossible to check the real protein loading because after the solvent evaporation, a solid mass composed by the protein mass plus the microparticle mass will be always obtained. Hence, it will be impossible to estimate the protein amount really adsorbed inside the porous and discriminate it by the protein mass precipitated outside or not adsorbed at all (as in the reported case). By this way, the protein loading will always be quantitative and a burst effect will always be promoted (as depicted in Figure 2A). The loading method described by the same authors in Pastor et al 2011 is undoubtedly more reliable. MGF: Both the method used in our previous publication and this one share the same limitation: they do not allow direct measurement of the associated protein. In this regard, please note that in our previous publication (Pastor et al. (2011) Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces 88, 601–609) we were only able to quantify the protein that was NOT associated to the platform. While we believe that studies such as those published in the previous publication are more suited to measure physicochemical parameters in the adsorption process, a method that achieves close to quantitative loadings of a biopharmaceutical in non-equilibrium conditions are preferable for pharmaceutical development. Because we were cautions of the fact that our system does not allow the determination of the total amount of protein loading, we made sure that we extended protein release times in all studies to a point where reasonably high protein recovery (>70%) had been obtained (see Fig. 2A and 2B). Note that recovery of prototype C in 2A, even if not shown in the graph, was 77.2% ± 4.2 (n=3) after two weeks (stated in line 197 of the manuscript). R3: It is impossible that such a different proteins (especially considering the pI and size of both in relation to the 6nm pore size) show almost the same release kinetic profile. In sum, considering the above detailed comments together with many others issues encountered along the manuscript, this referee considers this research work unable to be published in PeerJ. MGF: aCT selection as a model protein was based on a proteomic screening of databases for protein similarity. In fact, the difference in Mw between both proteins represents just over 10% (10.7%) of the whole weight of BMP-7, and the difference in isoloelectric point (pI) was just 1.4 units. Even more important, since both pI values were above 7.5, this ensured that net charge was similar for both proteins during protein loading and in the release medium. I think any minimal analysis of the pharmaceutical or drug delivery literature will show that most model proteins used in other papers have far less structural similarity than aCT and BMP-7. In our case, we have already used aCT as an indicative model for loading and release studies with BMP-7 (Reguera-Nuñez et al. (2014) Biomaterials 35, 2859–2867). However, note that although we assume that aCT might a predictive model for BMP-7, we do not expect nor claim to have achieved the same release kinetic profile for both proteins.

Considering the comments and the critical points exposed by the referees (specially the third one) , the manuscript is in a very preliminary form, lacking of a set of important experiments, and therefore unfortunately this work cannot be accepted for publication in PeerJ.

The paper shows the control of the protein release from a support having different pore size. Results are clear, smaller pores permit a very slow release. However, they did not show if the enzyme is still active, or if the support may have any kind of interaction with these enzymes. Detailed list of suggestions may be found below: There some text that papers in all pages of the paper, very likely a mistake in the conversion of the files (the text is “ically active form”), making in some cases impossible to read the real sentence. Abstract should contain main hypothesis, conclusions and results, introduction parts should be in the introduction section of the paper. Please, improve this section. In introduction they need to mention the forces that keep the proteins on the support (what kind of adsorption is achieved, or the enzyme is just “trapped inside the support”). Moreover, using medical proteins also effect of the immobilization on stability and activity of the enzyme must be considered, a proper immobilization may improve enzyme stability, but a support able to produce many enzyme-support uncontrolled interactions may have a bad result.

Authors manage to tailor the size of the inner pores of the particles and control the protein release process. They have emphasized the different preparation parameters that are critical for obtaining such small and uniform pore sizes. Authors should address a couple of questions: -Biodegradability and toxicity: No significant tissue accumulation, pathology, or toxicity has been reported from the ingestion of those insoluble or very slightly soluble silicon compounds by the toxicity of intravenously administrated silica nanoparticles should be commented [for example: Yu Y, Li Y, Wang W, Jin M, Du Z, Li Y, et al.
