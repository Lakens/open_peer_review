Review History Determinants of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type I<U+03B3>90 uropod location in T-lymphocytes and its role in uropod formation To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Mathis et al investigated the molecular determinants of PIPKI<U+03B3>90 localization at the T cell uropod and how uropod formation is controlled by this isoform. Using overexpression of PIPKI<U+03B3>90 variants in WT T cells and experiments in PIPKI<U+03B3>90-null cells they report that the C-terminal 26 amino acids of the protein are required for uropod localization and further propose that recruitment of PIPKI<U+03B3>90 to the uropod requires flotillins. This is a well-written and well-presented manuscript on an interesting topic. The work is well done and well controlled. I recommend publication in PeerJ as is. Cite this review as
