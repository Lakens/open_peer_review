Review History Movement velocity in the chair squat is associated with measures of functional capacity and cognition in elderly people at low risk of fall To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The authors accomplished a well scientist manuscript revision. I appreciate the scientific improvement of the manuscript and i think now could be published. Only some minor details must be checked before to publish the manuscript as punctuation in line 119, space of parenthesis in line 140, the correction of 'nor' in line 146 if was a mistake and the parenthesis use in line 157-158.

The authors should be commended for presenting a concise and very well-written manuscript. Below I provide specific comments of the different sections of the manuscript that I hope they could contribute to improve the presented manuscript. ABSTRACT Line 84. Change “consisting on” by “consisting of”. Line 87. Delete N=40 because it is redundant. Line 88. It would be interesting to include the load used in the CSQ test. Line 89. Delete “Additionally” Line 92. Use the abbreviation for “chair squat exercise” or remove this abbreviation from the abstract. Line 93. … correlations “were obtained” between… Line 95-96. If possible, include the value of the ES after each variable instead of using the range. Line 97-99. I think that the conclusion would be more informative if the author indicates in what consisted the “muscular performance test” instead of the device that was used for the measurement. INTRODUCTION Line 118-119. Introduce the abbreviations of these variables if the abbreviations are going to be used later in the manuscript. Line 122. Change “this” by “these”. Line 124-127. Consider to change this sentence for clarity to: “Finally, it has been shown that the velocity recorded against a submaximal load can be used to accurately quantify the maximal strength capacity in a large number of resistance training exercises”. Add at the end of this sentence several references that support this statement. Line 129. Change “correlations” by “relationship” or “association”. Line 132. Consisting “of”. Line 135-136. I miss a couple of sentences in the introduction to justify the hypothesis of the authors. MATERIAL AND METHODS General comment: I suggest to describe first the chair squat test and then all the remaining variables that were correlated with the performance in the chair squat test. Line 138. “Matherial” should be changed to “Material”. Line 143. Consider to change to: “Participants were also divided…” Line 149. Change “participant´s” to “participants´” Line 159. If authors decide to use abbreviations (e.g., HGS), they should use these abbreviations consistently through the manuscript. Line 164-165. I miss one parenthesis after 0-20. Line 179. “ms” should be changed to “s”? Line 186. Change “calculations” by “statistical analyses”. Line 190-192. This sentence would fit better when describing the chair squat test. Line 196. Why using 95%CI for correlations and 90%CI for standardized mean differences. RESULTS The results section is concise and very easy to follow. DISCUSSION Line 222-224. It could be interesting to highlight in the discussion the benefits of the test used in the present study compared to the 30-s chair test (e.g., faster assessment). Line 234. The word “thus” could be omitted. CONCLUSIONS Consider to change to: “This study showed that the mean velocity recorded by a smartphone app during the chair squat exercise is positively related to…”.

I want to thank the author for write this interesting manuscript. However: 1) I suggest count with a professional English servirse to improve the re-phrasing, use of punctuations and minor mistakes with grammar. 2) The reference need to be expanded to give support some topics as methods. Please see attached comments. 3) The manuscript fulfils the scientific structure. But i suggest to add a universal format of data .csv o .txt. Minor changes are attached in comments. 4) The hypothesis is relevant for clinical context, but needs to improve their previous knowledge (introduction), discussion and conclusion with major changes. Please see attached comments.
