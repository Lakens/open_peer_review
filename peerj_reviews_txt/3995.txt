Review History The reanalysis of biogeography of the Asian tree frog, Rhacophorus (Anura: Rhacophoridae): geographic shifts and climatic change influenced the dispersal process and diversification To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
Although all three reviews were brief, the reviewers found several strong points in your manuscript but all 3 identified aspects that need to be addressed before it would be acceptable for publication.

Orlov, Poyarkov, Vassilieva, Ananjeva, Nguyen, Sang, and Geissler, 2012, Russ. J. Herpetol., 19: 23-64 noted extensive confusion with Rhacophorus robertingeri in the literature and mentioned R. chuyangsinesis considered as a junior synonym of R. calcaneus. Thus, the authors need to correct data.

Because computer programs change over time and the default parameters are not necessarily rigid, it would help to specify what the default parameters are. This also helps the reader to know that you judged particular parameters and associated assumptions to be the best ones for your data. Cite this review as

Excellent manuscript by the authors. Since the manuscript talks about geological phenomenon, I felt Two important papers from Indian sub-continent were mission from the manuscript. I would be good if the following papers are cited in the revised manuscript. 1. Taxonomic revisions of Rhacophorus genus in Indian sub-continent was given in Biju et al 2013. This paper did not find a place in the manuscript. 2. Similarly, Vijayakumar et al 2016 provided insights on glaciation, gradient and geography of Western Ghats, that perhaps shaped diversification in Raorchestes genus. This can be cited in the manuscript. Cite this review as

Format of text is not consistent throughout the manuscript. For example, "et al." are italicized in some case, but not, in normal, in other case. Correct such basic formatting throughout the manuscript before submission.
Experimental design
The results of the present study and the former one (Li et al., 2013) were very different. Especially, the estimated ancestral area is quite different. The present authors must clarify any difference in samples, analysis, and interpretation on the results between them.
Validity of the findings
As shown on Fig.S1, 1) a lot of nodes lacked a significant supports. Further, 2) the topology is not consistent between Fig. S1 and Fig. 2. Need to improve or explain on these two major concerns.
