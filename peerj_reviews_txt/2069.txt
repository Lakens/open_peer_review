Review History Retrospective study on structural neuroimaging in first-episode psychosis To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
Dear Authors, There are important comments from both Peer Reviewers which I hope your team can use to revise and add more information. From Peer Reviewer 1: Add more literatures about neuroimaging results when there is negative focal neurological features. As the findings are not new and already known;then please expand on what is new about this manuscript? There are publications that indicate negative imaging results for almost all patients who have no neurological deficit and is this applicable also for psychotic patients without neurological deficits? From Peer Reviewer 2 : Importantly the definition of psychosis: Why did you use CAARMS criteria to define psychosis? This seems unusual. Surely DSM-IV criteria would be more appropriate here, especially given that you later describe that diagnoses were according to DSM-IV. Lines 99 ff. Details on how MRI and CT scans were acquired are missing and should be added (i.e. the make and model of scanner, sequences, etc.). Also please add information on how images were viewed (i.e. which software was used to reconstruct and display the images). Thank you

Basic reporting
label_br_4
Basic reporting of this manuscript is fine.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The design is appropriate, but some questions remain concerning image data acquisition. See more detailed comments below.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
The findings appear robust and the conclusions valid.
Comments for the author
In this manuscript, Coentre and colleagues present a retrospective report of neuroimaging (CT/MRI) abnormalities in a sample of first-episode psychosis patients. It is investigated how frequent abnormalities in these patients are and what the clinical and demographic associations are. The study makes a contribution to answering the clinical question of what may be expected from neuroimaging in the clinical work-up and subsequent treatment of this patient group. Minor Comments Line 70: What is B.K.? Lines 77/78: What do you mean by “MRI is not yet widely available”? Do you have numbers to back this up? Line 85: What is a “clearly referred study design”? Lines 91-93, definition of psychosis: Why did you use CAARMS criteria to define psychosis? This seems unusual. Surely DSM-IV criteria would be more appropriate here, especially given that you later describe that diagnoses were according to DSM-IV. Lines 99 ff. Details on how MRI and CT scans were acquired are missing and should be added (i.e. the make and model of scanner, sequences, etc.). Also please add information on how images were viewed (i.e. which software was used to reconstruct and display the images). Line 107/108: This sentence is not clear to me at all. Please rephrase and put more clearly. Lines 235/273: These references appear incomplete. Cite this review as
