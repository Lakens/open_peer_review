Review History On the reproducibility of science: unique identification of research resources in the biomedical literature To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The manuscript reports findings on a very important problem in biomedical literature and will serve to be very useful in many dimensions.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
The authors have carefully chosen 5 areas or reagents that are often not reported accurately in the literature. Here are some experiments that would add value or strengthen the claim of the paper. 1) In papers where the reagent was not easy identifiable, it would be interesting to know how many other papers have cited this paper and claimed to have prepared their reagents using the methods used by that paper. 2) The authors don't say much about whether there is a bias in the number of papers they selected. Is 135+86+17 a good representation, is that enough?How many of these papers had no relevance to this study, i.e were not experimental papers requiring reporting of constructs, antibodies etc. 3) Would it have been possible to randomly ask a subset of authors from papers that don't have indentifiable resources to see why they did not report the details. Is it because the journals don't have a structured form to report these details? From the data presented, it almost seems like the stringency has no bearing on the # of identified resources. 4) Is it possible that there are way too many reagents to report for any given paper and authors report the resources for just a select set of reagents that are most relevant to understanding the point of the paper? 4) In terms of recommendations, the authors seems to suggest a lot of different options, but none of them are very decisive. So far journals have been successful in requiring submission of sequence to GenBank or structure coordinates to PDB and authors for the most part stick to this requirement irrespective of the name of the journal. How has this been successful and is there something to learn and extend for other resources?

1.p.6, on the discussion of the difficulty of identifying cDNA or peptides related to a gene: have the authors also encountered issues with identifying the species in which the sequence was isolated ? There have been reports that this is problematic. 2.I am a bit surprised about the identification of organisms: usually yeast, frogs, worms, and flies are relatively easy to unambiguously identify; moreover, there is no data for human. How was the analysis done ? For example, 0 % of the yeast were identified, but is there evidence that it should have been the case, in other words, were there any yeasts papers in the set ?
Comments for the author
This paper addresses the very pertinent issue of the lack of sufficient information provided in papers to allow research to be accurately reproduced. The article is very well written, and the results are interesting and provide some quantitative measure of the extent of the problem. Minor comments: 1.p. 7, "Statical analysis": the section title should be marked with underline the same way as 'Journal selection and classification' above. 2.p. 9, Section on Cell lines: There seems to be missing something in the sentence "A source for cell lines was rarely reported and was most common factor for their low identifiability in our study"; please rephrase. 3.At the end of the same paragraph the authors write "see methods section"; it is not clear what they refer to, since this is already the methods section. 4.p. 11: "While it is assuring" -> "While it is reassuring" Cite this review as
