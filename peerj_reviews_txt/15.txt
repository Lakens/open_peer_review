Review History Fluorescent protein tagging confirms the presence of ribosomal proteins at Drosophila polytene chromosomes To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_1
1.Correct miss-localization (page 4). 2.Correct coversplip (page 13) 3.Reference Format is not correct.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
1.What do you mean with this sentence? The nuclear localization of the tagged proteins suggested association with chromosomes. 2.How many cells were analyzed for each variant of transfection with fluorescent/confocal microscope? 3.I miss scale bar for all microscopical images. What is it low and high magnification in Figure 4 & 5? 4.What kind of zoom factor was used in “low magnification”? 5.In Figure 2 D, S15-GFP image does not totally correspond to merge image. 6.Page 12: „Cells were incubated one ore two nights..“ Do you mean that cells were cultivated overnight and 30 hours?

This is a careful study of the in vivo localisation of selected GFP-tagged ribosomal proteins in Drosophila salivary glands. The study supports the hypothesis that at least some ribosomal proteins are associated with chromatin in vivo. While not essential for publication, it would be good to know if the GFP-tagged RPs can rescue mutations in the endogenous genes. Similarly it would be interesting to examine the degree of co-localisation seen with different RPs, presumably why RFP and GFP versions were tagged. Cite this review as
