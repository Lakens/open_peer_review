Review History A retrospective study: does upper airway morphology differ between non-positional and positional obstructive sleep apnea? To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

I acknowledge that the authors have made some corrections and improvements to the original manuscript, however most of the statements that were not clear in the first version are still not clear. The manuscript absolutely needs to be revised by an English translator, in fact, many statements sound incomplete and without the main verb. Minor comment: - Materials and Methods: the authors state that the 105 patients underwent surgery. I suggest to add the reason why they required surgery (OSAS treatment)

I think the article can be published with corrections. Given the limitations of a retrospective study, the reported data and the conclusions still make sense. The authors used routine polysomnography and CT scanning in the appropriate manner and the data were unsurprising. The fact that NPOSA , compared to POSA, is worse and due to anatomical abnormalities is not at all a surprise. And the reasons appear totally logical in that there was, on the average, a lengthened soft palate and a reduced or narrower glossopharynx. My concern is with the clinical significance with respect to treatment regarding these observations. If one has OSA it requires treatment regardless of whether one has POSA or NPOSA due to the well-known debilitating consequences of untreated OSA. One possible conclusion is that NPOSA would probably almost always require PAP therapy whereas POSA might be more susceptible to a mandibular repositioning device. Some discussion along these lines might be helpful. Wrt data reporting, there is no need for 2 decimal points. For example, patient age should be 30.2 +/- 9.4 years not 39.23 +/- 9.41 years. And the same applies to BMI, AHI, and so on.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
They authors used routine Procedures to assess OSA and to measure the patients' anatomical characteristics. And the statistical evaluation followed standard and correct procedures.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The findings are valid while not being very surprising. However, nice to have meaningful statistical data.

This study is to investigate the differences in upper airway morphology between positional (POSA) and non-positional (NPOSA) in 75 patients with obstructive sleep apnea. But please consider the following questions: 1.What is the significance of exploring this difference in the progress and treatment of the patients with OSA? 2.How to judge POSA and NPOSA? You should provide for the method of analysis of these concepts. 3.How to consider the relationship between nocturnal rostral fluid shift and the severity of OSA? How to avoid this kind of confounding factors? 4.Why all of these patients only have OSA? How about MSA or CSA these patients? Cite this review as

Jiao and colleagues retrospectively described the differences in upper airway morphology between 30 patients with positional and 45 with non-positional OSA. Various measurements and diameters calculated on CT scan are compared between the 2 groups. The paper is overall well written and shows some significant results, however there are some major and minor revisions to address. In particular, the authors use too many abbreviations, and some of them are not so easily interpreted, which makes the article sometimes difficult to read, since the reader is obliged to check the meaning of the abbreviation quite often. Furthermore, The discussion is poorly structured, I suggest to briefly report the main results and then discuss each of them comparing with prior literature. Major revisions: - Materials and Methods: the authors state that they performed a PSG, but they did not include electroencephalographic data. I suggest to add this among the study limitations. - Results: Mean age of study population was 39 years. Differently from other studies, The study population is very young, can the authors justify and comment on this? - in the Results, line 119, the authors do not write if BMI was different between groups. This data is written in table 1, however, given its importance, I suggest to add it in the text, too. - discussion, lines 154-157: the meaning of this sentence is not clear, I suggest rephrasing. - discussion, Lines 159-166: I suggest to deepen this point. - discussion, line 178-179: 'specifically...35.41mm'. This result is not present in the result section. I suggest to add it to the section and then discuss. - discussion, line 196-199: ' while there... the two groups': I suggest to better explain this point. - discussion: add to the limits of the study the retrospective nature.

Major revisions: - CT test is not routinely asked in patients with OSA. The authors should explain why the exam was requested in this group of patients. If it was requested for research purposes, patients should have signed an informed consent.
