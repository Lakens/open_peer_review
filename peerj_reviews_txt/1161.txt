Review History Lack of genetic structure in greylag goose ( Anser anser ) populations along the European Atlantic flyway To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The study ventures into analyzing the complex biogeographic relationships of the greylag goose, a species with highly dynamic populations across Europe and elsewhere. The species of this genus appear to be comparatively little differentiated among populations and studying the within-species variation is therefore inherently difficult. This was fully appreciated by the authors who nevertheless try to analyze the complex genetic relationships. Such an analysis was overdue and the efforts of the authors have to be appreciated. The obvious shortcoming of the study is the restriction to a few sampling sites, basically along the Atlantic coast (Fig. 1) that by no means reflects the complex pattern of breeding populations, regional seasonal movements and (obviously changing and dynamic) migratory patterns. The conclusions reached in this paper are therefore to be taken with caution. Line 291: Given the low power of the Mantel-test (Legendre P, Fortin M J /2010/ Mol. Ecol. Resour. 10: 831-844) and the P-value of 0.08 and the general problem of type II errors, the statement “no relationship” is too strong (even when presented as an ‘indication’). Figure 1 was largely taken from Comolet-Tirman 2009. The map there was compiled from Wikipedia-sources (sic!) and contains several geographically misplaced entries and especially gaps. So, for instance, sampling sites 1 and 2 would not lie in the breeding range of the species. Cite this review as

The authors made a great effort to sample Anser anser across western Europe focussing on Scandinavian breeding areas and French wintering sites. As typical for Anseriformes they failed to find a clear genetic substructure, at least with respect to geographic correlation. Since they used a large number of state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools to evaluate their DNA-sequence and microsatellite data, further data analysis does not promise to gain clearer results. The number and style of provided figures illustrates the (missing) data structure. Overall I consider this paper a valuable contribution to our knowledge.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
Sampling, lab work, and data analysis were mostly following current standards (for exceptions see below).
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
The authors provide numerous potential explanations for the missing clear substructure of the goose population, but their final conclusions regarding the impact of hunting should not be drawn from the results of this study.

Please correct the following: Consistently use upper- or lowercase for English names, provide scientific names with or without parentheses (ll. 57 vs. 74 and more often). Use subscripts where appropriate (e.g. fst in l. 213 and more often). References: In titles use uppercase only in the beginning and for names, in journal names for almost all "important" words, but not of, the and so on. 40 climatic changes or climate change 83 genetics 148 use proper acronym for dnasp 174 14 221 ten eight 261f four one one one 263 HWE not introduced before 272, 279 qi 291 A P value of .08 is obviously n.s., thus delete "n.s.".
