Review History Antibodies to Bordetella pertussis antigens in maternal and cord blood pairs: a Thai cohort study To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_2
The article meets all basic reporting criteria.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
The work is original and the study design is appropriate and clearly explained. The methods are well described and the analyses and presentation of results are adequate.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The investigators establish the poor level of protection against pertussis in both mothers and infants in a Thai population, setting the stage for additional work in support of maternal immunization with Tdap. Interestingly, this work in a location where whole cell pertussis vaccine is given to infants provides an opportunity to understand the role of adolescent and maternal vaccination with acellular pertussis vaccine followed by whole cell vaccine in infants. The discussion and conclusions of this study are well stated and supported by the data presented.

Basic reporting

Figure 1, showing the distribution of declared pertussis cases according to age from 2011 up to 2016 is not very informative, as only for 2015 (n=51) and 2016 (n=72) the figures can be split in reasonable numbers. I would suggest to put the data of Figure 1 in a Table and also indicate how many of the cases were laboratory defined and by what method.

Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
One minor comment on the conclusions: -Line 149 states: There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of recently infected rates in women born before or after the EPI program: statistics on 1 vs 2 cases? This can not be used for a statistical analysis
Comments for the author
A general comment: Line 227: Our results explained the susceptibility for pertussis among newborn infants in Thailand and supported the requirement for a pertussis booster vaccine during pregnancy. It is clear that pertussis booster vaccination during pregnancy will increase the antibodies in newborns, but it is also clear there are no actual correlates of protection for pertussis. Although antibodies to PT and Prn certainly play a role in protection, there is also evidence that other factors such as local IgA levels and cell-mediated immune responses are important.
