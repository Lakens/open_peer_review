Review History Sex- and tissue-specific expression of odorant-binding proteins and chemosensory proteins in adults of the scarab beetle Hylamorpha elegans (Burmeister) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

It will be better to include a brief explanation on the missing GO terms in the methods, and mention that the replicates are not 'true' biological replicates. Cite this review as

Major Revisions
Dear Dr. González-González and colleagues: Thanks for submitting your manuscript to PeerJ. I have now received two independent reviews of your work, and as you will see, the reviewers raised some concerns about the research. Despite this, these reviewers are optimistic about your work and the potential impact it will have on research communities studying odorant-binding proteins and chemosensory proteins, as well as scarab beetle biology. Thus, I encourage you to revise your manuscript accordingly, taking into account all of the concerns raised by both reviewers. Please provide the number of replicates used in RNA-seq experiments. Please also ensure that all of your methods contain enough information such that they are repeatable. Please also ensure that your tree-building is estimation of phylogeny (or just distance-based clustering). While the concerns of the reviewers are relatively minor, this is a major revision to ensure that the original reviewers have a chance to evaluate your responses to their concerns. I look forward to seeing your revision, and thanks again for submitting your work to PeerJ. Good luck with your revision, -joe

Basic reporting
label_br_3
The manuscript is written well, however one more round of proofreading is required (typos, missing articles, etc.). The Introduction provide sufficient background. The Discussion section is too short and should be expanded. Overall, discussion section is too conclusive and does not provide significant insight (the same information was already covered in Results). Authors might consider merging this section with Results. Next, it is not enough to just state that results were similar to other studies. Authors should elaborate, providing quantitative comparison.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
Experimental design seems to be appropriate and fit to the objective of the study. Sufficient details are provided.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
Conclusions are too general (more details are needed). For example, authors might consider adding the information about the main patterns they have observed and discuss the difference observed for different tissues in different sexes.

Basic reporting
label_br_4
Basic reporting is sound, and writing is clear and professional. In the abstract, and throughout the manuscript, statements based on correlation should use appropriate language. For example, "...suggesting that they are involved in the sexual recognition process..." is not based on any direct evidence, so it sounds more assertive than the evidence provided. Similarly for, "that this CSP participates in the oviposition process". Lines 19-21: How does transcriptome help to study cryptic habits? The rational is not very clear, and should be expanded or edited.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
How many replicates were done for RNA-seq? The information about biological replicates should be added to materials and methods. Without enough biological replicates, the de-novo assembly will be less robust. Line 162-164: "NCBI (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) protein 163 sequences of OBPs, CSPs, GRs, ORs, IRs, ORCo, SNMPs, ODEs and PDEs from 954 insect 164 species were downloaded to build databases." How exactly was that done? More details should be added to the methods.

Figure 3, 4: A Scale should be added to the tree to make it a phylogeny. Otherwise it would just represent the relationship. Authors should discuss why a large % of genes have no GO terms association assignment? Cite this review as
