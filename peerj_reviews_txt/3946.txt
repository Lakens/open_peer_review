Review History Can 9q34.2 rs633862 polymorphism predict survival in epithelial ovarian cancer? To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The authors need to address the discrepancy regarding the expression data. In the manuscript text they report that AA genotype has increased mRNA expression whereas the Gtex data (figure 2) states that GG genotype has increased mRNA expression. Also, in the text they report "rs633862 G<U+2192>A variant may regulate ABO expression" whereas it technically should be A->G since All other comments have been addressed. Cite this review as

Overall several parts of the manuscript- especially the introduction and discussion section needs to be rewritten to address several grammatical and punctuation errors. Several aspects needs to be rewritten to address the technical aspects and to ensure the right rationale and message is getting across The results need to be addressed again to ensure the statistics used are well explained and the correlation is well described

Line 141- p value – report the exact p value form the gtex Kindly expand on the results obtained from SNPinfo Kindly expand on the overall follow up time line. Detailed clinical and pathological information was retrieved for all the patients however, no information is provided. Including a demographics table including all this information is pertinent For the multivariate analysis- kindly mention in the methods exactly which covariates have been included in the analysis including if continuous or catergorical How was the bioinformatics analysis done to determine that the SNP was a TFBS. Also kindly expand on the actual bioinformatics analysis done vs. information look up using databases such as GTEx and UCSC genome browser. Along the same lines “Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis” is merely looking up the expression on the GTEX database or was any further analysis using the samples in the study done? The gene-expression of the ABO bases on the genotyped should be determined (if samples permit) in the study samples itself to check the correlation with

Rationale for picking ABO vs others reported in the previous paper by the authors should be expanded upon Conclusion/Discussion needs more clear writing to tease apart the message Lack of greater follow up time was reported as one of the short comings of the paper. However no details on the actual follow up done was provided Some kind of replication is warranted especially for the gene expression reported usingGTEX Further information is needed regarding the SNP in question - rs633862 - minor allele frequency especially in the Han chinese population - rationale for the grouping of the SNP - AA+AG vs GG instead of carriers vs. non-carriers of the SNP
Comments for the author
label_cfta_2
The paper needs to address some big questions and several parts need to be readdressed to make it clear and lucid. More elaboration is needed on the SNP itself and the reason for not addressing the gene dosage effect and grouping both carriers and non carriers together. If G allele is being purported as the protective allele then additional analysis with just the GG genotype is needed to support this claim. Cite this review as

Literature references, sufficient field background/context provided Data missing for study group as detailed below
Experimental design
label_ed_3
Study group design- 1. Separating loss of follow-up and death from the disease may better clarify survival analysis 2. Time at enrollment is not stated. Importance arises weather neoadjuvant chemotherapy was introduced to advanced stage disease at time of enrollment. The same pitfall for discussing survival analysis is also true for treatment with Bevacizumab as it is a factor for prolonged survival in a subgroup of ovarian cancer patients. If so, this needs to be discussed as an optional explanation for survival difference. 3. There is a need for sub classifying EOC by histological subtypes as the prognosis is different. HGSOC comprised 71% of EOC in this study. Are the results true for other subtypes of EOC apart from HGSOC? 4. There is missing data regarding how many patients had reached to follow up and was there a difference between the groups in that matter?

Research question well defined, relevant & meaningful dealing with front research in oncology In summary, representing the study group by histologic subtype, number of patients reaching to follow-up, stage of the disease and novel treatments relevant for accepted treatment of ovarian cancer today my explain survival difference ruling out the hypothesis of this study Cite this review as

The report is clear and well written and professional English is used through out . References are up to date and relevant. There is a few typos to be corrected in subediting. Reference 1 Angelov et al. should be 2014 not 1900. Tables and figures are relevant and clear.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The research question is well defined, relevant and original. Methods appear to be well decribed.
Validity of the findings
The data is well presented and appear statistically sound. Limits of the applicability are acknowledged.
