Basic reporting
label_br_1
It is significant to explore the relationship between mesopredators and the habitat. The article revealed the role of fragmentation and landscape changes in the release of common nest predators. It is helpful for human to recognize how our behavior works on the ecological habitat. But I am very concerning the research site selection. How did authors make a decision to choice this area. If the observation place changed does the result also change?
Experimental design
label_ed_1
I think the experimental framework is rational. However, the study should choice multiple places and then can prove the result is robust.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
The findings are logical and meaningful. They are also significant to help human to know the effects of land use.

Although I found the article interesting, informative, and relatively easy to read, the article did have a few areas of grammatical, sentence structure, and word choice issues that made these sections a little unclear. I have made specific comments in the article pdf.
