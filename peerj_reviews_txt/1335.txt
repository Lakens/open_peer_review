Review History Overcoming pain thresholds with multilevel models—an example using quantitative sensory testing (QST) data To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The authors present the basic concept of signal detection theory (SDT) as a method of investigation of differences in somatosensory function. The authors introduce SDT using data from the mechanical pain sensitivity test of the quantitative sensory testing protocol as an example. The manuscript adhere to PeerJ policies.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
The manuscript presents an interesting method of multilevel models to estimate continuous data simultaneously on the individual and group-level. This method could be interesting for the field of clinical research and clinical practice. The manuscript is well and comprehensively written. The questions posted by the authors are well defined. The methodology is clearly explained. Data presentation is clear and includes appropriate statistical methods.

p. 16, last raw: The sentence seems to end abrupt: "At present we believe it is best to use these parameters descriptively without" Without what? Please add the missing words. Cite this review as

1. Introduction: I recommend that the authors add a short description about QST. Example: QST consists of seven tests measuring 13 parameters according to the QST protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS). It is possible to quantify the performance of human somatosensory nervous system in subjects and patients with the complete protocol. Using this method, properties of nociceptive and non-nociceptive submodalities of different groups of afferent nerve fibres and central pathways can be determined. (Mücke et al. 2014) 1.1. Thresholds If you introduce the methods of limits and levels-method, further advantages and disadvantages should be mentioned: To determine the sensitivity of a patient or a test subject compared to the defined test stimuli under the QST, perception and pain thresholds can be quantified. Also available are "level" and "limit" test methods - with varying advantages and disadvantages. The "level method" entails a sensory test method, whereby stimulation is provided repetitively below and above the perception or pain thresholds. After application of the test stimuli, the subjects are asked about the perception or painfulness of the stimulus, specifically whether they are perceived as painful or not. The threshold determination is based on the stimulus intensity at which 50 % of stimuli are recognised. The disadvantage of this method is precisely the long study period required to determine a threshold; furthermore, numerous repeated measurements in determining pain stimuli can also lead to the development of sensitisation phenomena just below or above the threshold. Another psychophysical method is the "limits" method. As part of this process, the perception and pain thresholds are recognised as the first identified stimulus under increasing stimulus intensities. In contrast to the "level" method, the "limit" method overrates the actual threshold, since the tested threshold includes a reaction time artefact. The subject has yet to give feedback after reaching the threshold, while the stimulus intensity keeps increasing further together with the reaction time. The advantage of this method is the short investigation period until the threshold determination is reached. (Mücke et al. 2014) 2. References: Some more recent studies about QST and data analyses should be cited (see references 1-4). List of references the authors should consider to be cited [1–4]: 1.

Limitations: Limitations of SDT should be explicitly explained. 4. Figures: Figure 2: The representation of Figure 2 should be reconsidered. The panels are too small and not readable, therefore not easy understandable. Some minor points: 1. Some minor typos and grammar should be corrected. 2. Keywords: Quantiative sensory testing (QST) should be added, since SDT has an impact on QST. 3. Please introduce abbreviations such as GLM. 4. Special terms e.g. “d’ and C parameters” should be explained for laypersons (postgraduate, students etc.), which could also be interested in this paper. Cite this review as

A more detailed information about the methods (e.g. MPS) would be helpful for the user. E.g. the authors state that they have analyzed data from 172 children (p. 8). They state also: "We analyzed the individual responses to 15.480 responses of the children" (p.9) The link is unclear for the reader.

The methods, the results and figure 2 would benefit if they were more detailed and clearly explained for the readers without profound expertise on statistical methods. Cite this review as
