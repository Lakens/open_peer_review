Major Revisions
Dear Aihong, I have received reviewers’ comments. Two reviewers both raised key issues of experiment design and equations 6 and 7. Several inconsistences (for example in lines 125, 259, 475) were also identified. Please make revision of the ms according to reviewers comment. I look forward to see your revised version. Best wishes, Hong YANG

Comments for the author
The writting of this paper is very poor. There are many errors. The methods to determine the suitable or optimal oasis area do not have robust physical base. I don't think the current form shows contributions to the community as the methods are not novel and the results can not supported by the data. 1.The equation (7) is wrong, please carefully check the wording in the citation, especially the location of this item “10-5”. I do not agree with this formula, the reason is as follows: “Ep is the phreatic evaporation from construction land in an artificial oasis”, as I know the phreatic evaporation you used in your text (equation (11)) is the vegetation water use, not the construction land water use. And you had just classified the land use/cover into six types including the forest land, grassland, water, residence site, cultivated land and unused land. Did you mean that the construction land was the residence site? You also mentioned that “AA is the area of an artificial oasis”, however, I thought AA was the area of cultivated land, where you had mentioned above that artificial land included cultivated land and residence site, and you had already omitted the industrial and domestic water uses in the numerator of the equation (7). 2.Line 15, “and weather and socioeconomic data, suitable scales of oases were analyzed.” However, I did not the find the detailed weather data, except the introduction in the study region. Please add one figure about the detailed weather data, or just rewrite this sentence. 3.Line 251, The equation (6) is wrong, please add <U+2211> in the right side of the formula, and check carefully. 4.Line 259, the water quota of natural vegetation was 2250 m3 hm-2, therefore, the water quota was 225 mm, however, in Line 287, the water demand quota of the natural oases was 400 mm. Please unify the water quota. Similarly, water demand quota of the artificial oases was not unified. 5.Line 302, In the cited reference, the A was the optimal area of a natural oasis, however, in your text, you had changed to the optimal area of an oasis, and you used the same equation as the cited reference. Please check it carefully. 6.Line 475, “natural oasis occupies 60%, and artificial oasis occupies 40%”, however, the proportion of natural oasis and artificial oasis in Table 2 was not the rate.
