Review History The sensitivity and specificity of methylene blue spray to identify the parathyroid gland during thyroidectomy To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The authors sprayed methylene blue onto the thyroid bed of 47 patients receiving thyroid lobectomy. The area with faded color was suspected to be parathyroid glands. Histopathology was a reference. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were analyzed. I reckon the findings from this study are clinical meaningful and very useful in practice. 1.Methylene blue was sprayed after the recurrent laryngeal nerve and upper and lower parathyroid glands were identified and the thyroid gland was pulled back (Line 78-80). While I believe the high sensitivity of methylene blue will be very useful, this study has shown us that methylene blue may not be necessary if surgeons have high surgical skill and good knowledge on surgical anatomy. Please discuss. 2.The biopsies were conducted at the area that was suspected to be the parathyroid gland based on surgical anatomy, which had regained its yellow color (Line 83-84). Please report if there was any case and any area which was suspected by surgical anatomy but having blue-stained color. I assume that there were none. Please confirm. Cite this review as

Comments for the author
This is a prospective diagnostic study which the authors sprayed methylene blue onto the thyroid bed of 47 patients receiving thyroid lobectomy. After five minutes, Biopsies were conducted for histopathology at both the stained area and the area in which the color had faded. The area with faded color was suspected to be parathyroid glands. Histopathology was a reference. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. 1.If after spraying methylene blue, the difference of the area that can quickly absorb the color and other area could not be observed. Where to make the biopsy or to find parathyroid according to surgical anatomy knowledge. Please discuss. 2.Using of methylene blue spray is a test with high level of sensitivity but the specificity is not very good so it is suitable to be a screening tool. Therefore, other tests with good specificity should be used along. The conclusion should be toned down. Cite this review as
