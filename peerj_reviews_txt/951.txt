The investigators examined whether IGRA, a novel promising method of tuberculosis diagnosis, is an effective diagnostic method for tuberculous pleurisy. Considering the worldwide burden of tuberculosis, especially in the developing countries, the study has a potential value for the clinical physician, and also for the health policy maker.

Whether IGRA can be used to diagnose TP is controversial. In this study, the authors conduct a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the overall accuracy of IGRA for the diagnosis of TP. The article includes sufficient introduction and backgrounds. However, there are minor errors in the format, for example, in line 116, 173, 375, 384, 468, 476 et al. Please be aware of the format and typo errors for the purpose of publication.

In this paper, the authors tried to meta-analyzed the available evidence on the overall diagnostic performance of IGRA applied to pleural fluid and peripheral blood to investigate whether IGRA is a good method for diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy (TP). The topic is interesting, however, the result from this study is far less informative.

1. What is the novelty compared with previous meta-analysis as listed in ref such as "Sester M, Sotgiu G, Lange C, Giehl C, Girardi E, Migliori GB, Bossink A, Dheda K, Diel R, Dominguez J, Lipman M, Nemeth J, Ravn P, Winkler S, Huitric E, Sandgren A, Manissero D. 2011. Interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Eur Respir J 37: 100-111." 2. What is the significance of this study? 3.What is the rational for using Chi-square test, multiple regression? 4. It seems that the flow of this manuscript is not well organized.

The diagnosis of pleural effusion can sometimes be a challenge to the clinical physicians. The article investigated the value of a new assay for tuberculous pleurisy, which is a common disease in developing countries. The investigators examined whether IGRA, a novel promising method of tuberculosis diagnosis, is an effective diagnostic method for tuberculous pleurisy. The study appears to be a worthwhile topic, especially with consideration of its potential clinical validation. However, there are some concerns regarding the manuscript. 1. The criteria of the study enrollment should be discussed in details, including the features of related study designs and the methodological quality of the studies. 3. The authors should provide a table summarizing the significant characteristics of each study in the meta-analysis. 4. The authors should evaluate the quality of the studies enrolled in the meta-analysis. 5. Regarding the discussion section, the authors should first make a short summary of the evidence quality, the heterogeneity among studies. 6. Why does pleural IGRA show much better diagnostic performance than blood IGRA? The authors should discuss the mechanism in the discussion section. 7. Pleural IGRA shows much better diagnostic performance than blood IGRA, which should be included in conclusion section due to its clinical significance. Cite this review as
