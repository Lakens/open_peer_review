The authors did a good job in improving the manuscript, but some additional minor revisions have to be done: 1.Carefully check the manuscript for typos and for the English language style 2.Use the present tense for the abstract 3.In the keywords change “forcasting” to “forecasting” 4.Reference number (1) is in the wrong place, please add a sentence at the end of the introduction, where you state that other studies have been performed with supervised methods for predicting viruses and pathologies and cite reference number 1 and other related works 5.The caption of the figures and tables have to extended and improved. 6.Line 175: insert the unit of measure of time (iterations) in the manuscript 7.Line 184: why did you chose 4 folds for the cross validation sampling strategy?

Your submission "Comparisons of forecasting for hepatitis in Guangxi province, China by using three neural networks models" is currently not of sufficient quality to be published, in the actual form. Moreover statistical significance tests should be provided by the authors for the performed comparisons. The authors have to improve the study and the manuscript, by following the indications of the Reviewers comments.

Gan et al. propose the application of three neural network classifiers in order to predict the incidence of Hepatitis A,B,C,D, and E in the province of Guangxi (China). The work is interesting and the prediction results are promising. Although the approach seems to be sound, my main concern of the work is the validation of the results. Are the results and the performed comparisons statistically significant? The authors should provide a statistical significance test. Additionally, the sampling strategy for the training of the neural networks is not well explained. How many folds were selected for cross validations? Furthermore, the abstract has to be rewritten by focusing on the main objective of the work (i.e., the prediction of the incidence of hepatitis) and by not listing all the evaluation metrics. The results have to be presented in a more clear way better explaining the different metrics used to evaluate the approach. Finally, the conclusions have to be extended by stating what are the main findings of the work and by including the perspectives of it. Clear, unambiguous, professional English language used throughout. The English language is ok Intro & background to show context. The introduction is good, but some references are missing. Literature well referenced & relevant. Yes, but authors should cite other papers that deal with viruses classification, e.g.: Weitschek, E., Presti, A. L., Drovandi, G., Felici, G., Ciccozzi, M., Ciotti, M., & Bertolazzi, P. (2012). Human polyomaviruses identification by logic mining techniques. Virology journal, 9(1), 1. Structure conforms to PeerJ standard, discipline norm, or improved for clarity. Yes Figures are relevant, high quality, well labelled & described. The caption of the figures and tables have to extended and improved. Raw data supplied (See PeerJ policy). Raw data is supplied in pdf, please provide in csv (comma separated values) spreadsheet.

the article is written in good english. the introduction is sufficient. The description of the 3 methods is very synthetic and not sufficient to make the paper self contained. this is true, in particular, for the description of the third method. the structure is compliant with a template. figure are relevant and properly described and labeled.
Experimental design
the research question is well posed but incomplete. authors aim at comparing 3 forecasting methods based on several parameters; they do not provide justification for the choice of the 3 methods as opposed to other classical forecasting methods well established in the statistics literature (e.g., autoregressive models such as Arima and Arma). Such methods are quoted in the literature review but not tested, nor results obtained in the paper are compared with those from literature. there is to little mentioning of tuning parameters, of methods, softwares, and algorithms used for the estimation of the models. additionally, it is not clear how cross validation is used in the context of time serie and with how many folders. form the description of the results it is not clear if the 3 models differ in the variables that are used or in the lag, or whether a search on the optimal lag of the autoregressive model is performed.
Validity of the findings
the findings may have some interesting edges; alhtough, the differences in the performances of the tested models/methods are not so marked; in order to establish dominance between them, some statistical considerations (hypothesis testing) should be performed to compare the indicators. Also, authors should test properly tuned autoregressive simples model to make sure the the resort to much more complex and unstable methods such as the ones based on NN are indeed demanded by the complexity of the data.
Comments for the author
the quality of the writing is good; few typos and improvable details are present but I will pospone their fixing to an possible second submisson of the paper. In such a revision, make sure that the experiments may be replicated by a third party providing all needed information. Cite this review as
