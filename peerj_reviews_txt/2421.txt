I have just a couple of minor changes that need to be done: 1. Please spell out FMS and CFS in the abstract and then its abbreviation. Do the same for CFS in the Introduction. 2.Please add sd for the means in Table 2. 3. If possible add a limitation and implication section in the discussion. Cite this review as

Basic reporting
label_br_2
This submission didn't adhere to all PeerJ policies ; for references in the text, authors used Vancouver style and not the "Name. Year" style with an alphabetized reference list. Sometimes, the english was ambiguious for example lines 42-43 "exquisitely hyper-sensitive " but rather "extremely hyper-sensitive".
Experimental design
label_ed_2
The objective of the study is not clear for me. I don't understand if the objective was to assess differences between patients with fibromyalgia and those with chronic fatigue syndrome, or was to assess differences between patients with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. The assessment and the prevalence of CFS in the sample were not specified in the text.

The authors report an interesting study but the aim was not clear. We don't know if the objective was to assess differences between patients with FMS Versus those with CFS or to assess differences patients with FM and CFS. Cite this review as

1. Were the online questionnaires completed anonymously? 2. Please indicate the body that gave ethical approval of the study. If ethical approval was not required (e.g. because participants only completed online questionnaires anonymously), please state so. Cite this review as
