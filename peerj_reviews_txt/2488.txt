Review History Spermatozoon ultrastructure in two monorchiid digeneans To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The paper describes ultrastructure of the spermatozoon in two monorchiid digeneans, Opisthomonorchis dinema and Paramonorcheides selaris. The applied methods are appropriate and the presented micrographs are of good quality. This contribution provides interesting results that might be used in systematic and phylogenetic considerations. The authors used the cytochemical test of Thiéry for detection of glycogen, however, a detailed analysis of the localisation of glycogen is missing. It is recommended, that the authors will improve their results with a detailed descripton of the occurrence of glycogen in various regions of the spermatozoa of two monorchiid digeneans studied. The presence of glycogen should be added also in Fig.4, for completeness and comparative purposes. A comparison of the occurrence of glycogen in monorchiid digeneans and other relative digeneans should be discussed, as the presence/absence of glycogen or electron dense granules is important character in the spermatozoa of parasitic platyhelminthes.

This is an excellent ms, and I would like to highlight: -the excellent quality of TEM micrographs. -the interpretation of the obtained results is correct. -the main ultrastructural characters are discused. -the used references are enough.

The interpretation of TEM micrographs is correct and the obtained results will be very useful for a phylogenetic purposes in the Digenea
