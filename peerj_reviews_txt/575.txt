Review History MicroRNAs expression profile in CCR6 + regulatory T cells To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
It is very important that you justify very clearly the importance and significance of the miRNAs that you have selected and how/why you focused on the specific targets that you have chosen.

Comments to the Author The research paper, “MicroRNAs expression profile in CCR6+ regulatory T cells” by Zhao et al. offers an insight of miRNA role in distinct regulatory T cell subset. Data showed that CCR6+ regulatory T cells expressed different miRNAs profile and gene profile compared with their CCR6- counterpart. This research might be interesting for researchers in related field. There are some minor points that need to be solved by the authors: Minor comments: 1. The GEO number of miRNA expression assay should be supplied. 2. The statistical methods are not very clear and should be verified in Supplementary data fig 1. And the exact p-values also should be listed. Cite this review as

Comments for the author
In this study, Zhao et al we examined the expression profile of miRNAs in CCR6+ Tregs. They found that 58 upregulated and 62 downregulated miRNAs at least 2-fold in CCR6+Tregs as compared to CCR6-Tregs. This paper is too descriptive and there appears to be no logic in selecting the miRNAs for validation. Moreover, the data in the paper is of poor quality and without proper validation and some functional significance. Specific comments are listed below. 1. miR-142 and miR-21 upregulation in CCR+Tregs was validated by qRT-PCR. Error bars and p-value are missing. Also, in the text the authors mention miR-142a whereas in Figure S1, they validate miR-142. Did they validate miR-142a or miR-142b? 2. What was the rationale for selecting miR-21 and miR-142 for further validation? In other words, why did the authors select these 2 miRNAs out of the 58 miRNAs? 3. Y-axis label in Figure S2 is missing. Error bars and p-value is also missing for this graph. This is important because some of the differences appear very marginal. 4. In Figure S2, the mRNA levels of putative targets of miR-142 were measured. Some targets showed inverse correlation. 5. In the text supplemental Figures are cited as FigS1 whereas in the Figure they are shown as SFigure1. This should be corrected. 6. Figure S2 is missing from the results. 7. How did the authors select the targets of miR-142a for validation in Figure S2? Which bioinformatic tool was used? Putative binding sites should have been shown. Cite this review as
