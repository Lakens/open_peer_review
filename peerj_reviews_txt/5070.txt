Major Revisions
I agree with all reviewers when they state that your MS provide interesting and valuable information regarding the use of different models to assess the allometric growth of bivalves and specifically for Tivela mactroides. Also, the problem is correctly presented for the results that are shown. However, I also agree when, especially Reviewer 1 and 2, request for more information regarding the sampling points and the samples numbers, which means that you should provide more information on the sampling design and methods used to collect the specimens, as well as the reasons behind the limited number of data used to produce the analysis. The discussion should be revised in order to better explain and compare the differences between the classic and the more complex models. I therefore invite you to consider their comments and prepare a revised version of the manuscript that you submit, along with a rebuttal of how you have addressed their concerns. Thus, depending on your rebuttal and the revisions made I will consider if a second revision is necessary.

MS Ref: PeerJ_24725 Title: “Non-linear curve adjustments widen biological interpretation of relative growth analysis of the harvested clam Tivela mactroides (Bivalvia, Veneridae)" Authors: Alexander Turra, Guilherme N. Corte, A. Cecília Z. Amaral, Leonardo Q. Yokoyama, Márcia R. Denadai REVIEWER COMMENTS: The present manuscript submitted to “PeerJ” compares different types of models (simple linear, power and polynomial models) to assess allometric growth of Tivela mactroides, aiming to improve the biological information gathered in studies of relative growth. Overall, the manuscript is well written, organised and presented, providing interesting and valuable information on this research topic. Accordingly, I support the acceptance of the manuscript for publication in “PeerJ” following major revision (please see the general and specific comments listed below). General comments: Since the trigonal clam (T. mactroides) is a locally important fishing resource along the Brazilian coast, targeted by fishermen and recreational harvesters, the number of specimens analysed in the study is surprisingly low. In fact, after one-year of monthly sampling (Nov 2003 - Oct 2004) only 187 individuals were sampled (˜ 15 individuals per month). Nevertheless, the samples comprised individuals with a broad size range (3.0–39.0 mm in shell length) and the adjustment of the models presented invariably high determination coefficients and statistical significance levels. Still, I invite the authors to explain why such a “limited” data-set was used in the present study. The results revealed that “the power function was more suitable to describe the relationships involving shell length and weight parameters”, i.e. the “classic” model (Y = aXb) for analysing relative growth remained the best approach for assessing isometry vs. allometry in relationships involving both linear and ponderal variables. On the opposite, “morphometric relationships between shell parameters… were better represented by polynomial functions”. In this context, I invite the authors to improve their discussion on this subject, by explaining why relationships between shell measurements (linear variables) required more complex models (polynomial functions), whereas in relationships between shell measurements (linear variables) and weighings (ponderal variables), the “classic” power function was the most suitable model and more complex models did not provide any added-value. In the Discussion section, authors limit their explanations to the results obtained in the present study and do not provide comparisons with analogous studies performed with this species. For this reason, if available, I invite the authors to add and compare data gathered in previous studies on morphometric / allometric relationships in T. mactroides. Ideally, authors should highlight eventual differences resulting from the adjustment of different models (“classic” vs. “complex”) and the main advantages of adopting the present approach in terms of the information obtained about morphometric trends during growth (i.e. ontogenetic shifts) related to changes in the species biology / ecology.

This article reports the findings of an assessment of non-linear curve adjustments of relative growth analyses of Tivela mactroide. The paper is interesting and revealed the importance that classical and more complex models in studies of allometric growth of benthic invertebrates. The article is clearly laid and all the key elements are present (abstract, introduction, methodology, results and discussion). Please carefully read through the manuscript and correct inconsistencies and issues with orthography - grammar and style improvement (especially space between words). Overall, the paper is writen in clear English, mistakes are comparatively rare.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
This is a original primary research within aims and scope of the PeerJ. The research question well defined, relevant and meaningful. However, some questions about methods and experimental design need to be clearer. The sampling design and sampling area were not described and contain no information about replicates. It is not possible to understand the sites where the sampling was made neither by the map or by the succinct description of the study area. The authors mentioned in the introduction that the growth and shape of the shell are normally influenced by environmental factors, but there is nothing about characterization of the physical variables in the study area. Although the physical variables characterization was not one of the aims, it is important to characterize the environment to strengthen the hypotheses addressed in the discussion. The number of individuals was extremely low for allometric growth analysis. It was used approximately 15 individuals per month and only 5 individuals per size class. In one of the cited studies (Gaspar et al 2002), the shell morphometric was performed on 25 species with a measured N of approximately 300 individuals per species.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
The authors used the small-sample bias-corrected form of the Akaike Information Criteria, AICc (Hurvich & Tsai 1989) of the AIC (Burnham & Anderson 2002a) for the model selection, but why not to use Akaike (AICw)? Weights measure the relative likelihood of a model being the best for the given data. This is a straight-forward procedure in a multimodel inference routine (Burnham & Anderson, 2002). The discussion, in general, is suggestive and repetitive. The discussion still needs some work on the flow of logic and clarity of ideas. Example, in first paragraph Ln 199-202: “The usual approach when studying allometric growth in marine species is to a priori adopt the classical linear or allometric model (power function), which may have implications in the accuracy and precision of the estimated parameters (Katsanevakis et al. 2006; Rabaoui et al. 2007)”. The authors can not state this based on their own results. Depends on the selected parameters, in its study the power function was more suitable to describe all the relationships involving shell length and weight parameters.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_3
Maturity of individuals is also a frequent cause of a distinct change in morphology, given that more energy is allocated to the development of gonads than to the shell (besides considerable changes in weight). Would not it be more interesting to consider sex in the analysis? The authors mentioned that allometric growth analyses are performed using the linear equation and power function; and that these equations do not consider discontinuities in growth, besides may mask important biological information, however, it was the best model selected for half of the relations evaluated, especially relationships involving shell length and weight parameters. What do you suggest about it? Time is really an important factor in growth analysis. Do you consider a year as the ideal period for this kind of study? In addition to the allometric growth, individuals were separated by size class for the one of the novelties of the study: evaluate relationships between the dry weight of soft parts and the shell weight and ash-free dry weight. Is an N of 5 individuals sufficient to characterize the population standard? Cite this review as

Basic reporting
label_br_4
The manuscript is well-written; language is concise, unambiguous and technically correct. It also conforms to technical standards of courtesy and expression. The manuscript includes a sufficient literature review to provide adequate introduction and background relative to recent approaches in the study of allometric growth in bivalves. Relevant literature seems appropriate referenced; however, the titles of the articles in the list of references appear either as sentences (e.g. Corte 2015) or as titles (i.e., capital as the first letter of each word, see Caill-Milly et al. 2014). The three figures are relevant to the content of the article, they are appropriately described and labeled and their quality and resolution are good though could be improved; for example, equations in Fig. 3 would be clearer using a larger font and fewer decimals. Both tables are also relevant and clear. The provided raw data file is complete and clear. I believe that the article is self-contained in the sense that all results relevant to its hypothesis are included.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The research question, i.e. the potential shortcomings of “traditional” allometric growth models, is well within the scope of PeerJ. The topic is well defined, relevant and meaningful, and the results of this case of study are valuable. The investigation was conducted rigorously, and the methods are described with sufficient information and clarity to be replicated.
Validity of the findings
Data used in this article are statistically robust; the number of examined organisms is large, and the size-classes are well represented within the sample. The methods and criteria used for selecting the best model in each case are also adequate. In particular, it is commendable that the principle of parsimony was applied even though the alternative models that the authors are proposing are the less parsimonious. Even though, the authors were able to identify minor, subtle changes in growth which could be meaningful, and which are not detectable by the traditional approach. Up to this point the conclusions are properly stated and supported.
Comments for the author
This submission is a good example that the scope and decision criteria of PeerJ are adequate. For the most part the results were negative in the sense that the “traditional” power function model showed the best fit to the data. If negative results were not accepted, this article could be rejected based on a subjective determination of low impact or not enough novelty. Though the conclusions are properly stated and supported, and since PeerJ welcomes speculation as long as it is clearly identified as such, I would have liked to see a more extensive discussion on the meaning and possible causes of the subtle changes in allometric growth.
