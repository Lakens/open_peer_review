Review History Ellipse packing in two-dimensional cell tessellation: a theoretical explanation for Lewis’s law and Aboav-Weaire’s law To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

This paper investigate cells structures as ellipse packings and thereby provide insight into a set of observed laws for such structures. The investigation seems sound and the results reasonable. What remains unclear, however, is in what way these results are useful for understanding cellular structures. It is mentioned in the text that the results can be used for simulating cell topology during growth. How this should be done remain unclear, however. In general, it needs to be demonstrated, or, at least, argued for in what way the results are useful in this respect before the paper can be considered for publication. Cite this review as

Comments for the author
This paper presents a range of statistical data on 2d foams. It adopts a novel method of analysing 2d cellular patterns, involving the fitting of ellipses to individual cell outlines. I was not persuaded of the necessity for this and indeed some of the conclusions, but I do recommend publication. The work is substantial, and well placed in relation to the literature. Moreover it takes data from a range of biological materials. This will make it useful to many people, particularly as the question of the relation of biological cells to analogous physical systems is topical at this time. Cite this review as
