Review History The pretreatment albumin to globulin ratio predicts survival in patients with natural killer/T-cell lymphoma To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
I agree with the two reviewers that this paper adds to the literature regarding the prediction of survival in natural killer/T-cell lymphoma patients. I also agree with the reviewers in that I found it a pleasure to read. I had some minor suggestions for improvement which were similar to reviewer two: 1. Please make a clearer rationale for the need for a new survival prediction test in this cohort of patients, particularly in relation to some of the issues with the current tests. 2. Please provide a little bit more detail in the introduction regarding the possible role of globulins and albumin in influencing survival in this patient group.

This manuscript was a pleasure to read. It has been very well written and the work provides considerable benefit to the area of research. I feel it provides excellent data upon which further studies can be undertaken to assess the validity and reliability of using the AGR for survival in patients with natural killer T-cell lymphoma.

Basic reporting
label_br_3
This is an interesting study. This reviewer has a few queries, outlined next: It would appear that the biological rationale for this study is entirely based on sentence beginning line 65. However, the biological relevance of globulins / albumin is not further explained, and the next sentence beginning 'Therefore..' on line 67 is premature; it is not clear to me from the introduction why AGR is relevant to NKTCL. It also not clear why a new prognostic indicator in NKTCL is needed? It is stated in the intro that other prognostic indicators are controversial, but it is not clear to the reader why these are controversial
Experimental design
label_ed_3
Was electrophoresis or immunofixation carried out to assess serum globulin appearance in NKCTL? were patients assessed for other concurrent disorders including MGUS which can increase globulin size by over 10-20g/L and is common in older age. The authors acknowledge that relevant proteins (e.g pre albulim) were not measured in this study. did the authors measure indices of renal function that could have enabled them to control for renal function in their analyses? It is stated that patients with renal disease were excluded, so there is some acknowledgement that renal function is an important consideration. was creatinine, or better, c-cystatin, or free light chains, measured? Given the broad range of age in this study, renal function may be useful for any prognostic justification of AGR
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
the validity of the findings appears sound, but more information on the 'make-up' of serum proteins in NKTCL would be of interest to the reader. and some justification of why certain relevant proteins were not measured (e.g., renal markers / markers of malignancy) would also help the reader accept the findings of this manuscript.
