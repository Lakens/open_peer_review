The paper is generally well written, with the introduction and background providing good context for the undertaking of the research. Literature referenced is relevant. Figures and tables are well constructed and easy to read. The following needs to be addressed: a) check consistency of research citations for APA format b) check for consistency in use of terminology through out the article, that is, correctly introduce relative age effect followed by acronym in brackets then use this throughout article and not interchanging c) check for consistent use of hyphens throughout the article when using right-hand, left-hand etc

Validity of the findings
Data is robust, statistically sound and controlled. Findings are of benefit to improving literature however would have liked to have seen more discussion of findings in relation to applications for talent identification, suggestions on how these findings could influence training design for improving acquisition of skill generally and in the right- hand vs left-hand mismatch scenario
Comments for the author
Well researched and well structured paper. Discussion could have been broadened to include practical applications of findings to pathway managers, high performance coaches, talent identification personnel and managers Cite this review as
