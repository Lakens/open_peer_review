Basic reporting
label_br_1
Although the manuscript is somewhat improved, on re-reading it for this review, I cannot help but see there are many points on which the details are not sufficiently clear, nor the context adequately set. Please see the general comments below. The figure outlining the technique does not succeed in conveying its message, an improved caption and a more linear structure would likely help. The other figure captions would also benefit a bit more descriptive nature. The introduction has some gaps in placing the work in respect to prior literature - specifically in regards to the place of probabilistic tractography.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
The work is original, and provides a practical alternative to existing pre-surgical analyses of DTI data based on simple visual perception or pre-existent atlases of fibre tracts. Unfortunately, there is still room to improve the expression of the technique they propose, and separate this from the assessment procedure covered by the study. A point that would be of interest and is not addressed is the reproducibility of the results - does it matter if the original tumor ROI is too big / a bit small? The choices - a 2cm exclusion zone, and factor of 1.2 for the tumor zone region; do they have a significant impact on the results? The selection of what the authors call target clusters is rather ambiguous - more concrete criteria would be desirable.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
As a demonstration of the methodology, the work has been adequately executed, and I have no major concerns on this front. However, the number and mix of patients do not speak to a statistical power driven study for the comparison of patient sub-types performed. as such, the results can at best be expressed as suggestive. Moreover, the discussion is very internally focussed and could be somewhat reduced making space for a more universal consideration of the technique - are the results any different than what would have been / was seen using conventionl DTI analysis techiques? - given the exclusion zone, and the mass effect on the tumor side, is it fair to use the argument in the introduction that a technique is needed to deal with non-major tracts, when the results reached seem likely to be dominated by major tracts - were the tracts identified by the technique really ones that could not be obtained using a tract atlas? - are inherent laterality differences adequately addressed? For future work, ore interesting comparisons can be envisaged, regarding different grades, types of deficits in the patients, and histological and molecular traits of the tumors.

Related to this, while Figure 1 is a welcome addition, it would benefit from a more consistent labeling of the steps and uniquely associating colours of ROIs with the various seed ROIs. One should also mention that these are simplified procedures as ROI dilations, exclusion zones etc are not mentioned. Please rework the figure until someone not associated with the study is able to look at it and have a pretty good idea of the technique.

There is mention of fibers arriving at the centroids - presumable they arrive at the clusters associated with the centroid. I didn't understand the need to differentiate between dual opposed and single clusters, perhaps a bit of explanation why this was necessary / useful. Perhaps a few words of explanation. Were there tumor ROIs that led to more endpoint clusters? If the reason for the information was to support the "tracking through the tumor region" issue, please consolidate the pieces relating to this issue in one place AFTER finishing to describe the proposed method. It is complicated enough as it is, without adding sub-tests into the mix. A bit of justification seems missing. l149-50 reached by most of the tracked pathways - how was this assessed?

I believe the details about two target regions could be moved to results. Instead, please provide a suitable introduction which relates to the proposed method and not its evaluation, or make it clear why you are distinguishing (to me pointlessly as it seems they all should have their place in a consistent evaluation of ALL the tumors) between single/ dual,near / far tracking without having provided justification for such in the introduction. As it just seems a mash of steps. l160 another tracking frameworktotracking is this other tracking actually any different than the technique (i.e. the framework) used previously? If so MUCH more information is needed about the difference. If it is only that tracking is now done based on the Once the distal seeds are identified, might one summarize the further steps as: The tumor-based and distal seeds on both the affected and contralateral sides were used in in several ways to provide a complete evaluation of the impact of the tumor on WM fiber architecture. Where diametrically opposed distal seeds were seen relative to the tumor, the two distal seeds were used to infer connectivity between the areas in both the affected and contralateral hemispheres following a two ROI approach. To make inferences about possible distortion of the WM in the neighborhood of the tumor, the tour based ROIs were dilated using SPM morphology operators to 1.2 times their original size. This expanded ROI and all distal ROIs were then used in a two ROI analysis of WM tract density. Bending angle and fractional anisotropy criteria for the two ROI analyses were the same in both procedures (values). Based on the results of this proposed tractography procedure, three (or more?) comparisons were undertaken: Comparison between hemispheres, Comparison between tumor types, and Comparison against probabilistic tractography as described below. - done in this way, the details of how many had two distal ROIs, and how many not, can be shifted to the results. l173-8 the authors use the term contralateral first to indicate the healthy side (contralateral to the tumor) and within the same paragraph to refer to the tumor-bearing side (contralateral to the "targets").

Might it be better to replicate the distal seed generating process with the probabilistic method, and so have any such missed" projections, one would hen be able to comment on both the relative distributions of tracts and the presence / absence of "missed" tracts. This of course is made problematic by the choice of number of clusters etc which in itself seems subjective.

Basic reporting
label_br_2
The overall structure of the paper is fine and the general preparation is adequate. Unfortunately, the authors have not done a satisfactory job of communicating their message. The introduction provides an acceptable general introduction, but fails to clearly identify why an alternative is needed to existing approaches. A couple of points regarding possible displacement of tracts by lesions, interference of lesions with functional responses, and the possible lack of involvement of one or more major WM tracts would be useful. The last paragraph of the introduction would benefit greatly from separating the outline of the method from the brief description of how the method is to be evaluated. Moreover, the rationale of the method needs to be outlined in a suitable manner because the methods section breaks the process into steps that are difficult to follow the logic of the process. The rationale for and importance of the probabilistic evaluation should also be better stated.

label_ed_2
The method is reasonably described, though the sub-section on tracts of interest was not sufficiently clear for me to understand how the number of centroids generated was decided. While informed consent is stated, there is no indication that the study itself had been approved by the responsible ethical committee or research review board.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The results section needs fairly extensive rewriting. In particular, there are numerous comments that speculate as to the reason behind individual observations (e.g. "probably as a result of the tumor mass", and several other sentences involving "probably"). All of these comments should be eliminated, and such speculation restricted to the discussion (e.g. This could indicate that the underlying axonal structures have remained intact but spatially displaced) with relevant literature cited to support the claims or suggestions. When talking about the various pathways found, it might be useful to indicate where the lesion was and where the observed tract end point centroid(s) were. The discussion also needs considerable revision, firstly to provide a more readily followed line of thought, and more to reflect on its place in context of existing literature. As part of the connection to the literature, it would be good to reflect evidence from elsewhere that disruption is particularly consistent with tumor cell infiltration and not simply edematous changes. There is a large literature on individual diffusion parameters in brain tumors, some relation with how the changes reported in those studies relate to tractography could be attempted. As far as the validity of the results, the small number of cases in different conditions is a limitation, but also provides an initial indication that to some extent the type and severity of a tumor may have stereotypical impacts on WM.

A 10 mm diameter sphere around each centroid of interest was taken to define the corresponding target region (Figure 1). I found the tracts of interest part confusing, in effect, one form of analysis applied when a long-range tract was involved, and a second for localized tracts. I would expect the preceding steps to produce a variable number of centroids (the subjectivity of the decision about number of centrois should be mentioned in discussion), but why exclude smaller centroids, how large is a brain area? As reflected in Figure 1, why is the relatively short track set whose extensions are indicated by the central two arrows in All of this about the limiting of the numbers of target regions should be described in the target region sections. The tracts of interest section could then simply state that where multiple targets were present these were treated as endpoints for tracking, while where only a single target was defined, the original tumor and homologous ROI were dilated and used as the second endpoint (implications of this difference in tracking strategy to be mentioned in discussion).

This is an interesting study that attempts to explore the effects of different types of brain tumours on brain connections using diffusion MRI and tractography techniques. The paper is nicely written and reads well. I only have some comments that I think would clarify some sections. P. 2: The authors use HARDI and PASMRI. Even if there is nothing wrong with that, it may sound as an overkill for patient data. The choice becomes clear later in the manuscript and in the discussion, but it could be clarified and justified here as well. Maybe the authors could briefly mention that despite other techniques being available for resolving crossings using low angular resolution data (e.g. (Peled et al, MRI 2006), (Tournier et al, NeuroImage 2007), (Sotiropoulos et al, JMRI 2008), etc) the particular choice ensures higher sensitivity to fibre crossings. P. 2: Probabilistic Tractography: Please provide references (e.g. Behrens et al MRM 2003, Parker et al JMRI 2003). P. 3: The choice of the imaging protocol is suboptimal. Voxels are anisotropic (suboptimal for tractography, as signal will be lower and therefore uncertainty will be higher along the smaller voxel dimensions). Also, multi-shot acquisitions are more susceptible to subject motion, which is clearly an issue for patients. The authors need to justify these choices and/or at least discuss them as limitations. Finally, the reported resolution is probably interpolated. What is the native resolution of the data? (e.g. 120mm/70 slices does not give 1.5mm that the authors report as slice thickness) P. 4: Using five packages to do deterministic tractography is clearly unnecessary. Nothing wrong about that, but you make your life more difficult. Most of the functions you have performed using AFNI/SPM for instance can be done using FSL or SPM alone. P. 4. References 9 and 35 are repeated, they are the same. P. 4. Enhanced / Unenhanced: You mean Gadolinium-enhanced T1? Please clarify. P. 5-6: Defining tracts of interest. I feel this is an awkward way of defining tracts. Tractography can estimate paths everywhere, so what do the estimated paths in terms of anatomy and their relationship to the tumour area (particularly the ones identified between two targets)? Could you give us some insight behind this choice as opposed to focusing e.g. on specific tracts defined via strictly anatomical criteria? Figure 5: For the Meningioma case the shown example does not clearly support the main conclusion (i.e. that tracts are displaced by the tumour). Could you please provide a probabilistic tractography result for cases M3 or M4, rather than M2? That would make your point stronger and clearer. Cite this review as

The submission adheres to PeerJ policies and it is written in good English requiring only minor editing by a native English speaker. The introduction and background sufficiently demonstrate how this work fits into the field of using MR diffusion imaging for brain surgery. The description of the methodology is complex and it should be less redundant. The authors should try to reduce it in length. The tables and figure adequately illustrate the findings as described in the results section.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The clinical research question is broad and not very well identified. The authors aim to define alterations in WM paths induced by neoplasms. They conclude that decreases in tumor-induced tracts were significantly different between lesion types. However they do not consider a reference index (intraoperative electrical subcortical stimulation for instance). They do not compare their findings with other imaging parameters such as volumes of abnormally appearing white matter. The methodological approach chosen by the author for determining white matter damage induced by intraaxial and extraaxial brain neoplasm is original and sufficiently interesting. The authors made a big effort to use a novel approach with "user-independent" semi-automatic definition of seed and target ROIs, however their only minimal supervised method is going to leave out (or miss) several white matter tracts within and around the mass that may have an important role in brain function. The authors stop short from identifying the name of the major bundles that are infiltrated/damaged by the lesion. The authors do not indicate the name of the major tracts identified by deterministic tractography. This step is important and it would have important implications for presurgical mapping. It is well known that meningiomas displace and do not usually infiltrate or invade brain tissue. It was not a surprise to find that the average percentage of tract reduction due to tumor infiltration/invasion was much lower in meningiomas than in LGG and HGG. The finding that "the higher the Mib-1 label was, the more fibers were missing" is likely a corollary finding rather than an important one. This information could be easily gather from inspection of T2WI and T1WI post-gadolinium images.
Validity of the findings
The choice to use the PAS functions for multi-fiber reconstruction was a good one, because this method is less sensitive than classic DTI to missing white matter tracts in areas of crossing, branching or fanning. However this method has its own limitations that the authors should acknowledge in the appropriate section of the discussion. The method used to pre-process the diffusion imaging data, to identify seed and target ROIs is well described and relatively sound. The selection of the targets appear to be partially bias. In areas of T2WI signal abnormality diffusion imaging may miss existing fibers. There are asymmetric tracts in the human brain (i.e. arcuate fasciculus). How do the authors controlled for these two issues? They should address this issue in the M&M section. The results support the conclusions made by the authors. This reviewer ask if we really need such a complex and long methodology to quantify already well known differences in percentage of white matter damage induced by meningiomas and gliomas. A major limitation of this study was the lack of a reference index such as intraoperative electrostimulation subcortical mapping.
Comments for the author
Specific comments Materials and methods The authors should make an effort to identify the name of the main tracts reconstructed with MR tractography. They should report tract names in the table and figure captions. Results P12.8LGG are known to infiltrate white matter tracts while HGG tend to dislocate them and eventually destroy them. In the discussion the authors should make a comment about what they found and what it is reported in the literature. The Discussion is weak and very brief. The authors should put their finding in contest of the literature. They should describe in greater detail potential clinical implications of their findings on planning surgery in patients harboring neoplasms infiltrating eloquent areas. In the Limitation paragraph the authors should acknowledge limitation of tracking with PAS in areas of T2-weighted signal abnormalities. They should also acknowledge possible bias of their methods in ROI target selection. Main WM tracts coursing in the proximity or within the tumor may be missed with the approach used in this study. Figures Please indicate name of main white matter tract reconstructed according to anatomic position and describe relationship with the tumor. Cite this review as
