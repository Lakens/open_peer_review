Comment to manuscript : #20396 Activities concentration of radiocesium in wild mushroom collected in Ukraine after the 30 years from the Chernobyl Power Plant Accident (#20396) General comment: Useful data; can be accepted after some upgrade (also with a recent literature) Suggested improvements: Is: This accident released huge amounts of radionuclides, including radioiodine and radiocesium, into the environment, contaminating the lands of Ukraine, the Republic of Belarus, and the Russian Federation (Taira Y et al., 2011). Suggested correction: This accident released huge amounts of radionuclides, including radioiodine and radiocesium, into the environment, contaminating the lands of Ukraine, the Republic of Belarus, and the Russian Federation (Taira Y et al., 2011). A cases of a hot spot contamination with radiocaesium and high levels in mushrooms has been recorded also in the nearby countries such as Poland, Sweden or Norway while less elsewhere in Europe (Bakken and Olsen 1990; Cocchi et al. 2017; Falandysz and Borovicka 2013; Falandysz et al. 2015, 2016; Strandberg, 2004; Zalewska et al. 2016) Examplum gratia: [ Bakken and Olsen, 1990, Accumulation of radiocaesium in fungi.

Second, additional analytical uncertainties arose because the committed effective doses from dietary intake of mushrooms cannot measure the day-to-day variations in individuals in Ukraine. Suggested: Our study has several limitations. First, we could not evaluate the relationship between radiocesium concentrations in mushrooms and the concentrations in in the soil. Second, additional analytical uncertainties arose because the committed effective doses from dietary intake of mushrooms cannot measure the day-to-day variations in individuals in Ukraine. A household treatment can have a high impact on content of metallic elements and radionuclides in cooked mushroom and usually a decrease of activity concentration can be expected (Drewnowska et al. 2017; Steinhauser and Steinhauser, 2016)) but this aspect was not considered in our assessment.

Not: 583 (27–1,838) But: 580 (27–1,800) It also matters as relates to assessed exposure (mSv).

There are many important literature references missing in the text regarding radiocaesium concentration in mushrooms in areas affected by Chernobyl accident. For example, there is no mention to the ban of mushroom collection, and how it affected the internal dose due to their consumption. Raw data are shared. A map showing sampling points is missing.

The analysis of the radiocaesium concentration in mushrooms in Ukraine and how it may be related to those collected after Fukushima accident is an interesting topic. However, there are only data for three species of mushrooms in Ukraine and none for Japan. The authors use raw and dried mushrooms, this is quite confusing, since a dried mushrooms is not cooked. It would be better to express this in terms of fresh and dry mass. It is not clear if the samples were measured dried or not.

The novelty and the importance of the manuscript is very low, as it only gives the mean value of three species of mushrooms from Ukraine. There is no comparison with data from mushrooms collected just after Chernobyl accident. There are many significant references missing. The authors only focused on previous work done mainly by Japanese scientist in that area. In my opinion, this manuscript show only that the authors collected a lot of mushrooms samples and measured them. Therefore my recommendation is rejection. Cite this review as

The article is nicely written, clear and lucid English. Sufficient literature citation. I just mention one more article in line 52, 53 of introduction part. Six references have been cited. The following reference, which is newer than some of the reference cited also strongly advocates your comment in the relevant section. Therefore may be included: B Mukhopadhyay et al., J. Radioanal. Nucl. Chem. 273 (2007) 415-418.

Research question is well defined, relevant and meaningful. Methods described with sufficient detailing. According to APS, now year is abbreviated as 'a' (annum), when half life of a radionuclide is described. Please change '30 y' to '30 a' while mentioning half-life of Cs-137. In line 94 you described the detection limit of 137-Cs 28.5 Bq/kg (as you have calculated from median value). But it must be much less for HPGe detector for 137 Cs. I think you should calculate detection limit of 137-Cs from the background. You have not mentioned how much dry mushroom was taken for measurement of 137Cs and in what geometry. This is important information for gamma spectrometric measurement.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
Data is robust, statistically sound and controlled. I would be nice if you (i) describe any significant physical variation of the mushrooms from contaminated regions and non-contaminate regions taken from anywhere of the world. (ii) In figure 3 and 4, first data has very high error as calculated by you. Can you opine for this in discussion section.
