Review History Evaluation of Leymus chinensis quality using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy with three different statistical analyses To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_4
The ms is well written, don’t have any problem with the English. Tables and figures are adequate and relevant. The authors explain step to step the procedure carried out in the experiment: hay sampling, mathematical procedure, analystical methds, etc. The ms is easy to understand and read. In definite, it is a good ms.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The experimental design is adequate with the objectives planted in this experiment. I want to stand out in the experiment that. I) the number of samples used in this assay give a high degree realistic to the assay; ii) there was wide range of values in the parameters CP, ADF, and NDF what it is also important to obtain a good calibration and prediccition, and iii) it is important to use several mathematical model to know what method is the better in the predccidions.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
The validation was done in good way. The big number and variability in the samples did that the authors obtained a good calibration and let them to choose the best model to predict CP, ADF and NDF parameters.

label_cfta_4
This is a good ms, well written and discussed. With an objective novels, where the use of NIR is being development in a lot of agricultural areas. This method avoid complicated chemical analysis, it is cheap, fast, and reliable. Download annotated manuscript Cite this review as

Basic reporting
label_br_5
this manuscript is well written and tried to evaluate of Leymus chinensis quality using Near-Infrared reflectance spectroscopy, as well as the effect of three different statistical analyses on the chemical quality of sheepgrass. The scope is important and fit to this journal. The manuscript has some formatting errors (e.g. line 72: 117.19 ten thousand tons).
Experimental design
label_ed_5
The manuscript describes the NIRS prediction of quality factors in sheepgrass. The work has been carried out in the correct manner and is of reasonable scientific interest.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_5
As an important perennial forage grass across the Eurasian Steppe, sheepgrass is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions, high palatability, rich in nutrients and all kinds of livestock feeding. Hence, sheepgrass in this region is regarded as an important productive grass for the hay industry developing rapidly due to a prosperous status in the dairy industry. However, it remains unclear whether NIRs is applied to search the valuable information about NIRs prediction models and rapidly and accurately assess the quality of the hay dominanted by sheepgrass for CP, ADF and NDF.therefor, this work is very important for sheepgrass.

Good
Validity of the findings
Statistical analysis and comparison was good. For NIR data, normalization procedure across various samples needs to be discussed.
