Review History Impact of body weight gain on hepatic metabolism and hepatic inflammatory cytokines in comparison of Shetland pony geldings and Warmblood horse geldings To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
The study is well presented, and reflected the novelty. I feel that the manuscript is dealing with a good topic but lacks in the quality of preparation. The main problem found in the manuscript is related to the some aspects of the methodology and technical corrections. Please describe the subject of age differences clearly in MS and inform why these parameters (SAA, plasma glucose, serum insulin, TG and NEFA concentrations) are not measured for winter months. It is necessary to improve the manuscript by examining the questions that need to be clarified in a way. Please be aware of the manuscript should be presented according to guidelines for authors of PeerJ. For your guidance, you can check the reviewers' comments. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider your work.

The title accurately reflects the major findings of the work, however, I suggest to add “geldings to Shetland ponies and Warmblood horses. It is useful for the authors to mention the reason for the selection of only geldings animals in their study. Line 92-93: have age differences between the ponies and the horses been considered when comparing the results between two groups? Line 119-121: Serum amyloid A (SAA), plasma glucose, serum insulin, serum triglycerides (TG) and serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations were analyzed only in t0 (October 2015), t2 (October 2016) and t5 (December 2017). Have these parameters been considered in winter only? Line 114: Did the authors used a 14-gauge-catheter for blood sampling from ponies? Line 155-169: Could the authors clarify why they used surgical method rather than classical liver biopsy? Could the surgical operation influnce animal appetite, weight gain and the results of studied blood parameters? Line 231: Did the animals suffer from additional health problems due to excess nutrition such as colic? Were there any observations regarding the consumption of drinking water during the study? kindly focus on these observations. Line 237-238: Could the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 20 days before sample collection in one animal have any impact on studied liver parameters? Line 417-418: When discussing the results it is important to consider the time of sample collection (t0,2, 5). Also the impact of season on the results should be discussed.
