Review History Effectiveness of adaptive silverware on range of motion of the hand To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Comments for the author
label_cfta_1
The paper is generally well written and easy to read and understand. I must admit that the paper is original, it is a small but very interesting matter since no one has ever asked whether tools with over-sized handgrip were actually more efficient in hand-deficient subjects. It is one of those little things you always see in front of you but you have bever asked why it is like that. So...it's a smart paper. Download annotated manuscript Cite this review as

Experimental design
label_ed_2
Methods should be described with sufficient information to be reproducible by another investigator. There are not informations about the reliability of the measures No randomization was done for each conditions The tool used have a poor accuracy for this investigation, are necessary 0.01 degrees in fact the Coefficient of Variation is very higher to discriminate the different conditions
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The data should be robust, statistically sound, and controlled. There are not information's about: - the sample power estimation - the level of the significant - the Anova (univariate or repeated of the measures) - Fisher value - Partial eta square - the Coefficient of Variation was higher (Variable) TABLE 1 (MCP 52<88% - IP 25.8<41.1%), TABLE 2 (MCP 14<29% - IP 7<15% - DIP 18<19%) TABLE 3 (MCP 11<23% - IP 9<52% - DIP 14<19%) TABLE 4 (MCP 15<35% - IP 5<13% - DIP 15<17%) TABLE 5 (MCP 25<51% - IP 8<21% - DIP 15<31%) The authors should clarify the reason of this variability of the data
