As for the rigorous performance of the methodological course I have some observations. I understand as a fragility of the study the participants' choice for vocational training, different places of work (private and public system) and not considering the disparate number among them. Just as a suggestion, I believe that if it were a comparative cross-sectional study between different populations, the results would be less questionable. However, the choice of multiplicity of actors and sites does not invalidate the research. "When you put different professions and different places of action you can say that we can be faced with multiple views and different angles", that is, I believe that in the continuity of this study we must stratify the qualification of the indicators according to place of performance and type of professional activity.
Validity of the findings

It`s OK Only, the conclusion can be improved by identifying the need for further study..

Congratulations! I believe that this study could be further developed so that it becomes a reference for other services to point out their best quality indicators in Pediatric Nutritional Therapy. The experience in this area brings us multiple glances and we certainly need these to better serve those who so badly need this type of therapy performed effectively, efficiently and quality.

283/5000 The following correction is suggested for the present study: In Table 1, if categories of Qualitative Indicators in Nutritional Therapy refer to the same ones mentioned in the introduction and published by Waitzberg DL, for better understanding they should be described in methods.
