Review History Mitochondrial diversity in Gonionemus (Trachylina:Hydrozoa) and its implications for understanding the origins of clinging jellyfish in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Comments for the author

The new version has important improvements considering format (figures and tables), text and general conclusions. As we (reviewers) commented in the first round of review, this will be an important double contribution for marine biology: for biogeographical studies (considering regions in general), and for hydrozoan genetics&population studies in particular (indeed, very needed). I just recommend to simplify the title to (avoid to repeat "clinging jellyfish"): "Mitochondrial diversity in <Gonionemus> (Trachylina:Hydrozoa) and its implications for understanding the origins of clinging jellyfish in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean" Cite this review as

Minor Revisions
I have received comments from two reviewers. Both are very positive about your subject matter and work, with one recommending outright acceptance, and the other with some constructive comments that can help improve your paper. In particular, I agree with reviewer 2 that discussion about "origin" and "invasion history" are not clearly definable or obtainable by your results. Instead, your contribution seems to be more on “genetics related to population identity and structure”, and I hope you can restructure your paper (and title) in such a manner to reflect the slightly more speculative nature of the work. Based on this, my decision is "major revisions" are needed. I look forward to receiving a new version.

Basic reporting
label_br_2
Clear, unambiguous, professional English, language used throughout: yes Intro & background to show context: yes Literature well referenced & relevant: yes, excellent, including difficult to access papers Structure conforms to PeerJ standards: yes Figures are relevant, high quality, well labelled & described: yes Raw data supplied (see PeerJ policy): yes (Genbank)
Experimental design
label_ed_2
Original primary research within Scope of the journal: yes Research question well defined, relevant & meaningful. It is stated how the research fills an identified knowledge gap: yes Rigorous investigation performed to a high technical & ethical standard: yes Methods described with sufficient detail & information to replicate: yes
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
Impact and novelty not assessed: is assessed Negative/inconclusive results accepted: inconclusive results are clearly indicated Meaningful replication encouraged where rationale & benefit to literature is clearly stated: limited by available/accessible material Data is robust, statistically sound, & controlled: cannot be evaluated, but best possible sampling with available resources was done Conclusions are well stated, linked to original research question & limited to supporting results: yes Speculation is welcome, but should be identified as such: no speculations, but differing hypothesis are presented
Comments for the author
label_cfta_2
Phylogeographic studies on hydromedusae are desperately missing and the present study is thus a highly welcome trail-blazer publication with a high impact potential. Moreover, it concerns a serious stinger jellyfish and a species with a long-standing taxonomic discussion. Although more data are clearly needed for more robust conclusions, the study will certainly attract a wide audience and incite other researchers to contribute additional data from other populations.

Basic reporting
label_br_3
The article has minors considerations regarding main objective, results and final discussion/conclusion. Overall it is a very well written article, with adequate references, background and general structure.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
The article has a proper design dealing with genetics and marine populations considering a very peculiar organism.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
Findings are very interesting and well presented; speculative scenarios are well identified in most of the article (minor corrections are suggested).
