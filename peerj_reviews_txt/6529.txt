Review History Genetic diversity of Simao pine in China revealed by SRAP markers To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
Dear Dr Dawei Wang The revised version of the MS has improved considerably, but is not yet acceptable for publication due to language editing problems, for example: - "Introduction" is writen "Itrduction" - Last paragraph of the introduction is still in the present tense form: "In the present study, SRAP markers are used to ….""The study aims to evaluate …." etc If you agree, I will give you the last chance to solve the language editing problem. Best regards Ana Ribeiro-Barros

Dear Dr Wang Thank you for sending the revised version of your MS. At this stage, the MS still needs a deep language editing, particularly in the use of past tense (instead of present tense) in the abstract, methods, results and discussion. Please address carefully this concern. Best regards Ana I. Ribeiro-Barros

Dear Dr Wang, Thank you for sending the revised version of your MS which is now acceptable for publication. Nevertheless, before accepting it I would like to ask you to edit the text in order to correct the few typos and change the verbs from present to past tense. After these changes are included I will accept immediately the paper. Sincerely Ana Ribeiro-Barros

I have checked the manuscript carefully again and found it thoroughly revised the questions that I have suggested previously. So I recommend accept the manuscript after a minor question addressed: L 120, please authors add some parameters of STRUCTURE analysis for the datasets. Cite this review as

Dear Dr. Dawei Wang Your MS entitled “Genetic diversity of Simao pine in China revealed by SRAP markers”, has been reviewed by two independent reviewers, which raised several important issues (see reviewers comments). Based on that, I suggest that you include minor revisions. Particularly, I would like to highlight the need to deepen the discussion, regarding the population structure and driving ecological factors. Please follow the recommendations of the three reviewers. Also, please provide a new version edited by a fluent English speaker. Looking forward to receive the revised version, Sincerely Ana I. Ribeiro-Barros

This manuscript investigated the genetic diversity of Simao pine based on the SRAP markers. The authors found that this important conifer species have the high level of genetic diversity and low level of genetic differentiation among populations. They also proposed the some conservation and management strategies. Actually, the manuscript is interesting for the general reader of Peer J. There are some questions which need to address before acceptance in the Journal. Line 32, “the genetic diversity of the entire remaining natural populations…”, what is mean of the entire remaining natural populations? It seems that the means of the sentence is unclear, which should need to revise. Line 39-40, Results. The 11 populations reveal a relatively low level of genetic diversity in the species. Results show a high level of genetic diversity (PPB = 94.45%, H = 0.4567, I = 0.6484). The means of these two sentences are confused. Please revise it carefully. Line 42, AMOVA analysis changed to AMOVA. The cited literatures style, e.g., Line 59 (Wang et al., 2012) and others. The comma should be body not italic, please carefully revise the whole manuscript. In the whole manuscript, there are some mistakes and errors of the grammars and sentences. I think the authors could thoroughly revise the manuscript in the help of a native English speaker. Some spaces should be noted. E.g., Longitude(° E) Latitude(° N) in Table 1. In addition, I suggest that the authors could run the STRUCTURE analysis for their datasets and they could discuss the population structure furtherly.

1 Authors may discuss about how ecological factors influence the level of genetic diversity of Simao pine populations in nature. 2 Please give some possible reasons why Gst of Simao pine is different from some species or similar with some species. Cite this review as

In general, the English needs to be improved. There are many places with items such as missing punctuation and use of the term "use". These are not major problems, but need attention to improve the readability of the manuscript. Please see other specific comments on the attached manuscript.

Thank you for your contribution. In general,the manuscript is clearly written in professional, unambiguous language. If there is a weakness, it is in the missing punctuation and use of the term "use". (as I have noted above) which should be improved upon before Accepted. What environment were these Simao pine populations? Full sun or shade? Did this affected genetic clustering? And I think some original electrophoresis map is needed to public. Cite this review as
