Review History Evolution of genes involved in feeding preference and metabolic processes in Calliphoridae (Diptera: Calyptratae) To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Major Revisions
Your manuscript has been assessed by four expert reviewers. Based on their reports, and my own assessment, I am pleased to inform you that it is potentially acceptable for publication, once you have carried out some essential revisions suggested by them. Please provide more details about feeding habit differences among the four species studied.

This article seems to me interesting and well prepared. English is good and text is clearly to understand, figures are relevant (only text is too small in some of them). Introduction and background are well written. This investigation is a first step to study the evolution of feeding habits in some dipterous.

Validity of the findings
label_votf_5
This investigation is a pilot study in combining functional and molecular evolutionary approaches in flies. This study was performed professionally.
Comments for the author
label_cfta_5
I have found some abbreviations, which, I think, should be explained. For example L116 - cDNA, L248 Ct method. L339 should be "for" (gene) instead of "For" (gene) L244 "From the 21 possible candidates...." It would be interesting to have information about these 21 possible candidates. This information can be presented as supplement material. Text is Fig.1 and Fig 3 is two small, it should be enlarged. Cite this review as

The manuscript highlights how candidate gene approaches can be useful in generating data supporting the genetic basis of behaviours, often a difficult task, and likely a plastic response. The article is well written, with few grammatical mistake. Some citations are formatted incorrectly throughout the manuscript (i.e. Z, 1965 should be Zumpt, 1965 etc). Data are available.
Experimental design
label_ed_6
The experimental design was well thought out and comprehensive - with just a single but VERY important question that was unanswered: for the rearing of the insects (larvae) for RNA extraction, what was their timeline (when were they removed and extracted, under what conditions), and on what they were fed? Were all 4 species fed the same substrate? Based on the reference for the rearing conditions, the C. hominivorax are reared on a different substrate. What evidence supports that the substrate is not what is generating the response seen (see additional comments below)?
Validity of the findings
label_votf_6
The data are robust and statistically sound. However, more discussion into some of the variability observed (with the other genes, for example, sometimes you saw a great deal of variation in expression, other times you did not). See comments above for the experimental design, if the flies are not reared on the same substrate (as larvae), then the results observed could simply be due to the different substrate? Did you reciprocally rear the other species on the same substrate as C. hominivorax? It is possible that these questions are easily answered, but without knowing the exact rearing conditions just prior RNA extraction, the conclusions may not be supported by the data (i.e. it might just be a substrate effect and not an actual functional response).
Comments for the author
label_cfta_6
As I am familiar with these species, it does not bother me much, but the shorthand species names should be addressed using 2 letters for genera rather than one, since they differ: Co. macellaria and Ch. megacephala. Using C. for both indicates they are the same, when they are not. Cite this review as

Are there alternative explanations for finding a significant deviation? Lines 322-326. Should this be in the Discussion? Has causality been demonstrated, or should you write Mv1 is associated with [not influences] feeding preferences? What is meant by 'probably located in specific sites'? Discussion Amend taking into account your definition of 'expression levels' and those in similar research reports that have been published. Conclusion Lines 399-400. What is the suite of findings that would support the hypothesis, and what is the suite of findings that would reject it? Figures 2 and 3. Show statistical support for each node. Cite this review as

Validity of the findings
Four other obligate parasites blowflies can be studied for the Malvolio expression level.
Comments for the author
This paper attempts to reveal genes involved in feeding habit preference among blowfly species. The authors study expression levels of eight candidate genes that might be involved in the behavior and find that the expression level of a gene, Malvolio, differs among species and suggest that this gene is related to feeding preference. The aim of this study is interesting to understand the genetic basis of speciation of feeding behavior. However, their findings offer no information on the function of Malvolio. They select only eight genes for their studies, but this selection is not fair. It is unfortunate that they could only amplified eight genes among 21 candidate genes. Genes coding for chemosensory proteins (receptor and binding proteins) are good candidates. Then a systematic screening targeting for more numbers of genes would be the best approach. 1.The authors should describe details about the feeding habit differences (necro-saprophagous vs. obligate parasite) among four species. In particular they should explain how the feeding habitat of Cochlipmyia homonivovax is different from others. 2.It is surprising that the expression level of the Malvolio gene is highly elevated in one blowfly species. But the dendrogram based on this exceptional one case is not informative. I strongly recommend the authors to test other four species of obligate parasites for the Molvolio expression level. 3.The title of this manuscript is misleading as it is not clear that genes studied in this paper are involved in the feeding preference. 4. Malvolio is an ion transporter. The authors may discuss why the transporter is involved in feeding preference. Cite this review as
