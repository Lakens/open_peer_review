It is the first SEER based study on impact of RAI therapy in more than 2000 patients with Hurthle cell carcinoma. Rationale & benefit to literature is clearly stated. All underlying data have been provided; they are robust, statistically sound, & controlled. Conclusions are well stated, linked to original research question & limited to supporting results.

- The paper states important findings, but needs lot of revision from grammatical standpoint to be considered for "pass" state - Sentences throughout the paper need to be paraphrased because of grammatical errors - In discussion section, would suggest further comprehensive research into what is being done to address this issue from future standpoint. Are there any clinical trials to address this? - Also, figures for OS and CSS combined stage I-II and III-IV, though all stages have different course, as a result would suggest looking at each stage individually to confer exact OS and CSS difference.

Comments for the author
label_cfta_4
Dear Drs. Yang & Zhao, It was a pleasure reviewing your article on HCC. You stated some new findings, which need to be further looked at in prospective trials to further validate your results. However, before the paper is considered for publication I believe it needs major revision from grammatical standpoint. There are lot of grammatical errors, as a result sentences need to be paraphrased. In addition to that, I would advise looking at all the AJCC stages separately - stage I, II, III, IV to evaluate the OS and CSS. Also, in the discussion section, would recommend highlighting what is being done at this point from future perspective, that is stating any clinical trials looking at this question, or what is the best way moving forward with this issue.

1-Use of English is of poor quality throughout the text and needs to be comprehensively revised. If some of the problems are just simple grammar misuse, other sentences are not understandable. Here are a few examples: «receipt of radiotherapy» (line 98); sentence in lines 110-112 need to be rewritten because it is difficult to understand; «Extrathyroidal evasion» (line 114). «At the end of the last follow-up» (lines 130-131); «Patients without receipt of radioiodine», «Reception of RAI therapy» - legend of Table 2 , «the prognosis were better» line 182; sentence in lines 223-224 does not make sense. 2- Manuscript is well organized, with helpful figures and tables.

Validity of the findings

1-Authors should explain the fact that 7% of patients in the no-RAI group were not submitted to surgery. Taking into consideration that HCC is only diagnosed in histologic analysis, I wonder how the diagnosis was made in those patients. If no explanation can be found, this issue should be discussed. 2-In the discussion, authors claim that factors associated with increased frequency of RAI therapy may be used in the future to guide the selection of the best candidates for RAI therapy. However, this is a retrospective study aiming at evaluating the survival benefits of RAI in patients with HCC, so the authors cannot claim that those factors should guide our future decisions to perform RAI treatment in patients to HCC. To add to this, performing a total thyroidectomy is a prerequisite to perform RAI treatment in most cases.

In this manuscript, authors evaluated the survival benefit of radioiodine (RAI) treatment in a large dataset of patients with Hurthle Cell Carcinoma of the thyroid gland. This is a controversial issue, with recent data raising questions on whether HCC patients have poorer prognosis and worse response to RAI when compared with their non-HCC counterparts. Other strengths of the manuscript are: the use of a large well-characterized dataset of patients and the construction of a nomogram for prognosis stratification of patients with HCC, using widely available clinic-pathologic features. However, authors need to address several points to make the manuscript acceptable for publication. Adding to the points previously mentioned: 1-Authors systematically consider the married status of the patients in the analysis. The relevance of this should be explained in the discussion section. 2-Minor issue: The phrase «vital status» is repeated in the same sentence in lines 86-87. Cite this review as

Comments for the author
Quion Yang et al. aim was to find out in large population based research evaluating whether patinents with Hurthle cell carcinoma (HCC) can benefit from postoperative RAI therapy. Their study is interesting. However, there are some issues that have to be clarified before publication in the Peer J. Major comments: 1.Primary reference should be cited for the sentence of the Introduction (Paolo et al. is not appropriately cited) - lines 44-46 2.Lines 100-115: text is not clear. Can you be more married? Please rewrite. 3.Lines 145-148: State only those that are statistically significant. These are the only one that are important! Omit non-significant factors. 4.Line 191 Refernce Allia at al. is not appropriate (it describes cell cultures and not HCC in human body) 5.Line 202 Add reference Petric R et al. (BMC Cancer 2014, 14:777) 6.Line 223-224: not clear: “It seems that RAI therapy acts absence of survival benefit in the treatment of HCCs patients.” 7.Conclusions in the abstract section and at the end of manuscript should be as follows: “In summary, this study suggests that RAI therapy was significantly associated with improved OS in patients with Hürthle Cell Carcinoma. However, there were no association between treatment with radioiodine and CSS, possibly due to small number of deaths that were related to HCC.” Minor remarks Lines 58-59: Sentence: “Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is known widely to be effective in the treatment of postoperative thyroid cancer.” Should be rewritten as follows: “Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is known widely to be effective in the treatment of thyroid cancer after thyroidectomy.” Line 60 : insert “number of ” as follows: “….there are increasing number of studies……….” Line 64: insert “patients with” as follows: “…..evaluating whether patients with HCC can benefit from……” Line 127: instead “choose” use “be treated” Line 218: instead “confirm” use “evaluate” Line 221: Cox’s Line 226 and 227: instead of “limited samples” use “incidents” Line 238: instead: “solid elucidate” use “evaluate” Cite this review as
