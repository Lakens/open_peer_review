Review History Identification and temporal expression of putative circadian clock transcripts in the amphipod crustacean Talitrus saltator To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

In two places in the introduction there are broken sentences, lines 95-96 and 100-104, that should be corrected. Words that are spelled correctly but are being misused should be corrected, “understating” should be “understanding” (line 48) and “ally” (line 626) should be “allay”. The introduction states (lines 115-116) that the clock-controlled phenotypes of T. saltator are “critical for its survival”; while the presence of rhythmic behaviors undoubtedly increases the animal’s fitness, whether they are essential is a different question. Unless there is evidence in the literature that can be cited, this conclusion should be toned down. Methods would be more complete if the US companies cited also had the city identified, such as Trikinetics and Actimetrics.

Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
Line 559: It may be misleading to say that conserved functional domains were “characterised”. This term might imply to some readers that some functional determination was made to confirm, such as enzymatic or binding activities. It would be less ambiguous to say that that the domains were “identified”.

The manuscript adheres to PeerJ policies. It is written well, except for several long sentences which require rephrasing. In addition I have a few minor grammatical corrections to suggest. The article conforms with the PeerJ templates except for the abstract which is divided into - Background, Results and discussion. As far as I can see there should also be a methods section. The figures are good, clear (in the separate files) and relevant. Line 23-25 - sentence too long. Rephrase. Line 48 - understanding Line 73-78 - sentence too long. Rephrase. Line 95 - leads to Line 101 - suggesting Line 100-104 - sentence too long. Rephrase. Line 106 - remove sandy (appears again next line, same sentence) Line 120 - and circadian clocks (remove a) Line 161 - for temporal Line 563 - all genes Line 663 - the capability
Experimental design
label_ed_4
Overall there is a great deal of work reported, and the methods used are of a high standard. In the Blast2Go section it is states a sequence identity threshold of 95%. What about sequence coverage? Was a particular cutoff set in order to minimize erroneous annotations? What steps were taken to minimize miss-assembled contigs from being part of the GO analysis? This issue should be clarified. JTK Cycle was developed by Michael E Hughes in collaboration with Karl Kornacker and John Hosenesch, and not only by the latter authors. It is unclear how many animals movement contributed to the final results.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
The behavioural findings are very good and establish the point the authors wish to make. However, as stated above, it is unclear how many animals/observations actually contributed to this. This point should be clarified. Line 515 - It is stated that JTK_Cycle was limited to a period of 12-27 hours for detecting circadian cyclers. Is this reported correctly or a mistake?

Authors comply with all PeerJ policies and recommendations.
Experimental design
label_ed_5
The experimental design is sound an was made complying with international bioethical standards. They use modern techniques to elucidate difficult matters in crustacean molecular biology and succeeded in doing so. The authors use addecuate tools for all the molecular biology and rhythmic analysis and demonstrate the usefulness of this techniques in the specific objective they proposed.
Validity of the findings
The finding are valid, well explained and discussed
Comments for the author
In my opinion, the authors showed the importance of studying ecological relevant animal models and in doing so, they used a plausible way to tackle the problem of not having the complete DNA sequence of this animal. I must encourage the authors to use the chronobiology terminology more widely used to allow all readers to understand better their chronobiological findings.
