Review History Rice koji reduced body weight gain, fat accumulation, and blood glucose level in high-fat diet-induced obese mice To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The authors demonstrated that all rice koji have the anti-obesity or anti-diabetes effects although the mechanisms may differ depending on the type of rice koji consumed. This study include an interesting finding, hover, they should revise it according to the following suggestions.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
1) To clarify the effects of these extract on hepatic fatty acid synthesis, the authors should measure the expression of mRNA levels of ACD, acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, CPT II, carnitine palmitoyl transferase II, ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ACL, ATP citrate lyase in addition to FAS, ACACbeta, and PPARalpha. 2) The authors should investigate the GLUT4 expression on muscle of in vivo model, and should investigate the effect of these extracts on the expression of GLUT4.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The authors should carefully evaluate the effects of extracts on myotube cells, and also should confirm these findings using samples from in vivo model.
