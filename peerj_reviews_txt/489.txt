good. some areas need more details like the interview guide (even though a reference is given). the theory on which the qualitative data was analysed- could make it more clearer to read.
Experimental design
label_ed_3
A retrospective cohort was chosen, however the limitation of a retrospective interview has not been discussed. It would make sense to add them.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
Conclusion is solid. Again because of the retrospective nature of questioning the data should be viewed with caution - due to underestimating or overestimation have not been clearly discussed.
