Review History Evaluation of five regions as DNA barcodes for identification of Lepista species (Tricholomataceae, Basidiomycota) from China To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Comments for the author
label_cfta_1
The use of ITS as a barcoding marker for a genus of mushroom forming fungus, Lepista is presented in this manuscript. Overall, this is a good paper and contributes to numerous other clades of fungi where the ITS region is a favorable barcoding marker. Some comments to help the authors improve the quality of their paper are listed below: 1. Line 47, remove "(" before However. Line 48, delete 'believed', and then I think the sentence will make better sense. 2. Line 47–48, "two physical" rewrite as " as the two morphological characteristics...the sentence is unclear, please rewrite 3. Line 49, delete "some" 4. Line 54–57, DNA barcoding is different from phylogenetic analysis - please reframe your sentences here... See these papers: Hajibabaei, M., Singer, G.A., Hebert, P.D. and Hickey, D.A., 2007. DNA barcoding: how it complements taxonomy, molecular phylogenetics and population genetics. TRENDS in Genetics, 23(4), pp.167-172 Vogler, A.P. and Monaghan, M.T., 2007. Recent advances in DNA taxonomy. Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research, 45(1), pp.1-10. 5. Lines 61–63, please cite: Dentinger, B.T., Didukh, M.Y. and Moncalvo, J.M., 2011. Comparing COI and ITS as DNA barcode markers for mushrooms and allies (Agaricomycotina). PLoS One, 6(9), p.e25081. This is a key paper. 6. cox 1 has found to be unsuitable for fungi, so please don't refer in that it was judged to be a suitable barcoding marker...rather say it has been used for mushrooms previously... 7. Line 67, ITS, Internal transcribed spacer region. 8. Fig.1 Legend, explain the key results rather than simply stating what it means...Writing the legend with the key results will make manuscript more interesting for the reader. Same for Fig. 2. 9. Line 184, Lepista should be italics... 10. Are there type species in the samples analyzed? If so, please indicate. Also, how many species of Lepista have been sequenced? The work is based only on <10 species out of possibly 50 - does that give a good indication for the group? Have there been other studies of DNA barcoding on this group? 11. In Fig. 3, please only include values that are =70% (significant values) remove the rest as they are not indicative of strong bootstrap support. 12. What does a tree of all the combined markers look like compared to ITS tree? Perhaps add that to the Suppl information and deposit all alignments into TreeBase. This would make a nice, erudite addition to the paper. Cite this review as

Basic reporting
label_br_2
Basic reporting The text is written in a simple English. Introduction and background are not very relevant. In the introduction, I miss a hypothesis and/or objectives, questions. These sections are nor really informative enough. Figures should be labelled on the base of different colours. Raw data are available from NCBI database
Experimental design
label_ed_2
Yes, the manuscript represents an original primary research within Scope of the journal. The Research question is only mentioned into the abstract. The investigation uses standard tools commonly applied in DNA sequencing and sequence analyses. The methods are described with su<U+FB03>cient detail & information to replicate.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
Impact and novelty are not significant. The authors sequenced some genes, which are largely known to be too conservative. Data is not robust and the phylogenetic analyses are not really sound. DNA sequences for several species of Lepista available from databases were not included. Conclusions are in agreement with the evidence. It is difficult to understand the reason of why the authors are not including sequences from other databases in their analyses? Type-sites for some of these species are localized in Europe. In this way, for example, we should find or not depending of the species some intraspecific variation between natural distribution and new distribution site)
Comments for the author
label_cfta_2
The authors should put together sequences from other collections (for example from Europe) available from GenBank and some other database. Some of the species analysed were described originally outside China. For this reason, I’m confident that for developing an accurate barcode approach is imperative to include collections from the complete ranges of geographic distribution of the species analysed, if these have a broad geographic distribution.
