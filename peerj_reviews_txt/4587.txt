Review History Modelling the growth of the brown frog ( Rana dybowskii ) To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

According to reviewers' comments, a more detailed discussion would be required, besides an improved English language style. You should be aware that some comments are included in the annotated manuscript.

Basic reporting
label_br_2
The article is valid and meets the scope of the journal; however before acceptance and publication, it is necessary to improve the manuscript structure. As English is not the mother tongue of the authors, Thus, I suggest improving the language of the article. The literature cited in the article is sufficient to support the hypothesis but I suggest the citation of more studies on growth models in amphibians. The figures should be corrected and if possible reduce the amount of them. The results are interesting; however authors need to improve the discussion. Suggestions for improving the article are mentioned in the attached file.
Experimental design
label_ed_2
The experimental design needs to be improved. In my opinion it is not interesting to produce models for frogs at different ages, since for recommendation of producers and technicians, it will be necessary to apply only one model that corresponds to the whole life of the animal. The application of polynomial and linear models to describe the growth of frogs, I believe is not valid.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_2
The findings are valid for publication in the journal, and important for describing the growth of amphibians, since there is very little material for this type of animal production.

The article is valuable and should be published, but I suggest that the authors spend some more time in thoroughly review of the article. Some basic comments regarding the article structure are mentioned in the attached document. Cite this review as

I think that authors should read more references of the relationship between body mass/body length and age, especially in Chinese frogs in recent years. For instance, Lu Xin’lab in Wuhan University has published some papers about life-history traits in frogs in recent years. I have added some references related to age-body relationship in the text in attached file.

Comments for the author
I have now read and reviewed manuscript entitled “Modelling the growth of the brown frog (Rana dybowskii)”. Authors establish a working model to examine the growth of one-year-old and two-year-old (age 1 and age 2) brown frogs (Rana dybowskii) from metamorphosis or out-hibernation to hibernation under the same environmental conditions. They found that the third and fourth-order polynomial models provided the most consistent predictions of body weight for age 1 and age 2 brown frogs, respectively. Their findings will not only be useful for amphibian research but also for frog farming management strategies and decisions. It is interesting. However, we believe that, if the concerns outlined below can be addressed. 1. I think that authors should read more references of the relationship between body mass/body length and age, especially in Chinese frogs in recent years. For instance, Lu Xin’lab in Wuhan University has published some papers about life-history traits in frogs in recent years. I have added some references related to age-body relationship in the text in attached file. 2. The English expression need improve and some sentences I can not understand means and I can only guess. 3. In the paper, some minor errors in references need corrected and I have marked in text. Totally, I like this paper and hope that it can be published when my comments have been addressed. Some questions in attached file nee be also addressed. Cite this review as
