Review History Fluoxetine-induced alteration of murine gut microbial community structure: evidence for a microbial endocrinology-based mechanism of action responsible for fluoxetine-induced side effects To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The paper is now been improved following reviewers suggestions. Since the the findings are rather limited, I suggest in the future to develop them in a more complete form to improve their potential impact. # PeerJ Staff Note - this decision was reviewed and approved by Valeria Souza, a PeerJ Section Editor covering this Section #

Major Revisions
I suggest to re-organize results in clear and separate sections. Behaviour results should be included in the discussion or removed and the statistical approach used in the behavioural characterisation should be specified. In addition, please rephrase the sentence: "A numerical trend, although not statistically significant (p=0.08)" , the trend clearly indicate an absence of statistical significance.

Well written and appropriately structured manuscript.
Experimental design
label_ed_5
Sufficient level of detail in methods and satisfactory experimental design. Concern surrounding reproducibility. Ten per test group is quite low when looking at such variable measures as behavior and microbiota.
Validity of the findings
Concern surrounding reproducibility. Ten per test group is quite low when looking at such variable measures as behavior and microbiota. It is remarkable that statistical significance was achieved. Although these dramatic effects many represent a big impact, published results should be the product of 3 independent experiments. So it is recommended that the study be repeated.
Comments for the author
The manuscript is well written and clearly states aims and conclusions of study. More ‘quantitative’ figures, outlining phyla abundances and OTUs should be included in the main figures, rather than as supplemental figures, rather than just the heat maps. Perhaps find another way than tables to represent these data. Figure 1: Data should be presented as mean weight ± standard deviation. Fluoxotine vs. control should be directly compared at each time point and ANOVA applied to the data to determine whether any differences in overall weight are seen between groups. Add n= 10 per group and appropriate figure legend, use format similar to figure 2. Cite this review as
