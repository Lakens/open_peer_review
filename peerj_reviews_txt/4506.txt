Review History Cellular prion protein and <U+03B3>-synuclein overexpression in LS 174T colorectal cancer cell drives endothelial proliferation-to-differentiation switch To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

General comments There are quite a few grammatical errors throughout the paper. These errors, especially those in the abstract make it difficult to follow the paper at times. Minor errors 1.Line 291 typo: astrocyte 2.Line 234: Specify which software 3.The "internal control" on figure 1D needs to be clarified 4.Figure 2B is too wide 5.Figure 2D's low resolution makes it difficult to see the scratch assay 6.No scale bar for figure 2D 7.The Y axis for the figure 2D should probably be Time (hr) 8.Figure 2C has two graphs which share the same Y axis title "Conditioned media". It maybe better to title them " conditioned media from LS cells" or something like that to differentiate the two. 9.No Scale bar in Figure 3 images 10.Adjust the size of Figure 3 graphs 11.No Scale bar for Figure 4 images
Experimental design
label_ed_1
The experimental design is appropriate.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
Statistics mentioned are limited to identifying if the data have a statistical p value of less than 0.05. The P values should be mentioned and the data whose p value is below 0.01 or 0.001 can be highlighted Comments regarding the discussion While the cited Bussolino, Mantovani & Persico review article indicates that the angiogenesis involves changes in morphology, it does not mention EA cell line used in the manuscript. Is there any other reference that can show evidence that EA tube formation can be used as a model for the formation of new vasculature? Is there any evidence that NO levels may affect the proteins detected in the secretome (Figure 5)? Or are they independent
