Review History Maternal ancestry analyses of red tilapia strains based on D-loop sequences of seven tilapia populations To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

The manuscript title with ‘Maternal ancestry of red tilapias based on D-loop sequences analysis of seven tilapia populations’ written by Jiang et al analyzed the genetic diversity and variants of seven tilapia populations, and further speculated the maternal ancestries of three red tilapia varieties, based on the mtDNA D-loop sequences. The paper finely descripted the experiment design, and also provided a relatively complete genetic profile for the tilapia in China, especially demonstrated the new genetic information for the maternal ancestries of several red tilapia strains. In brief, the research is valuable for understanding the genetic profile of tilapia in China, especial for genetic origins of red tilapias, which could be the support data for the genetic protection and further utilization of tilapia resources in China. However, there are some mistakes and unclear descriptions presented in this paper. In my personal opinion, the present paper could be accepted only after minor revision. The specific advises or suggestions are written as follow: (1) Line 29: the description of tilapia resource of China, which might not closely with the present study. Which would suggest to replace with ‘many tilapia species or varieties have been widely ….’. (2) Line 36: the scientific name of red tilapia had been written with mistake, which should be corrected with ‘Oreochromis spp.’. (3) Line 63: there are words presented not clear, that is ‘tilapia variants that sport and attractive red coloration.’ (4) Line 80: the three strains are not clear, which are first time presented in the introduction. It is suggested to be rewritten with ‘three strains widely cultured in China (Yang et al., 2016)’. (5) Line 98: the number of ‘48’ in the head of sentence, should be corrected using the letter form, i.e. forty-eight. (6) Lines 125 & 128: the written form of software names should be checked carefully, ‘DNAsp5.1’ and ‘Mega 5.05’, should be rewritten with ‘DnaSP 5.1 software’ and ‘MEGA 5.05’. (7) Lines 128-131: the sentence which suggested to be rewritten with ‘MEGA 5.05 software (--) was utilized to calculate the Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) distances among populations, and to construct the Neighbor-joining (NJ) dendrogram set with 1000 replications of bootstrapping.’ (8) Line134: the software used to construct the haplotypes network, which should be provided in the paper. (9) Lines 140-142: the description for nucleotide composition of D-loop sequence is incorrect. The D-loop sequence is one kind of double-strand DNA sequence, the composition of A and C should equal to T and G, respectively. (10) Lines 175-180: the word ‘inter-population’ which suggested to be replaced with ‘among populations’. (11) Line 184: the subtitle of this paragraph, which suggested corrected with ‘haplotypes network of D-loop sequences in tilapia populations’. (12) Line 219: the word ‘generation’ should be replaced with ‘generations’. (13) Line 248 & 251: corrected the genus name and significant probability symbol with italic font, i.e. Channa, and P, respectively. (14) References related advices, the form of reference cited in manuscript and the references list should be carefully checked according to the journal. such as following: Cite this review as
