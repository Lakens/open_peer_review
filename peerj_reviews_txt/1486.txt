Review History Low oxygen alters mitochondrial function and response to oxidative stress in human neural progenitor cells To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Basic reporting
label_br_1
This is an excellent study that compares the human neural progenitor cells grown in physioxia and normoxia in terms of growth kinetics, glycolytic metabolism, mitochondrial content, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen uptake, ATP production, ROS production, and antioxidant enzymatic activity, thus shedding light on the importance of oxygenation control in studies focusing on disease and drug screening assays.
Experimental design
label_ed_1
The authors have done a thoughtful experimental design and the revised article is clearly explained.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
Authors have evidently demonstrated that alterations in physioxia-grown NPCs at the metabolic level not only occur but also lead to a differential response to exogenous oxidative agents.

This study investigates the importance of oxygen levels in neuronal development which will be used for drug screening. The authors showed that altered morphology of human neural progenitor cells and oxidative functions in physioxia condition. They also demonstrate that changes in the mitochondrial physiology in human neural progenitor cells are induced by O2 availability. They showed that human neural progenitor cells cultured in 3% oxygen and exposed to external agents have greater susceptibility to DNA damage.
Experimental design
label_ed_4
The authors did an extensive and a thoughtful in vitro analysis to demonstrate the role of oxygen levels in the development of human neural progenitor cells.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_4
Overall, this is an interesting study. Interpretations of all the results by the authors are fully supported by the experimental data.

Comments for the author
This is an interesting and well planned study. Authors have shown that, oxygen levels should be carefully considered for in vitro models of neuronal development and drug screening. i have few concerns -Abstract should be reframed, as it is confusing at this moment. -Authors should include the figures of the NPCs differentiation from human ESCs and their characterization in the manuscript. Which are lacking at this moment. - Authors should see the effect of antimycin-C on cell death, as authors have shown elevated ROS levels in 21% oxygen (in Fig.5) Cite this review as
