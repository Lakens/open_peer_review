Review History Automatic single- and multi-label enzymatic function prediction by machine learning To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Dear Authors, As you can see the three referees have a number of comments and requests that will make the paper stronger and easier to follow. In summary, they ask for a more comprehensive review of a field in which a substantial number of papers have been published. They suggest some papers and there are many others. They request details on the methodology and a more clear evaluation of the results. Finally, the referees suggest (and I agree very much) that the deposition of the datasets and software will make the results reproducible by others and increase its impact in the community.

The authors are presenting a methodology that is mixing peptide torsion angle and sequence alignment information to predict single and multi-label enzymatic function. In the Introduction section, the authors should mention other information coding that have been used for enzyme classification such as topological indices of peptide graphs [1,2]. About the data used for the study: it will be very useful if the raw dataset will be available in any open data repository (FigShare, etc.).

Experimental design
label_ed_1
The authors should explain why they used a new methodology to obtain these classifications during other publications presented a multi-label classification with 99.54 accuracy (line 38). How the current results are improving this number? It should be useful to present details when the authors are comparing results with previous ones: number of features, number of folds, type of data set split, etc. The reproducibility of these results should be improved by placing the raw dataset and the Matlab / python scripts as open repositories (GitHub, FigShare, etc.). Any scientist should be able to download the dataset and to run the script. It should be explained the reason for choosing the current type of data split and number of folds. When method performance are presented, it should be mentioned if there are training or test values.
Validity of the findings
label_votf_1
It should be explained better the advantage of this method compared with the other ones: using previous 99.54 accuracy, execution times, model complexity, etc. It should be specify that the authors are expecting for the deep learning methods by including new information. Why the authors are not using peptide graphs descriptors as invariant codification? (ex: protein star-graphs, protein contact networks using amino acid properties, etc.).
Comments for the author
label_cfta_1
The manuscript is presenting an interesting method to mix molecular information for this type of classification of enzymes. The main three weak spots: the argument for using a new classification comparing with the previous 99.54 accuracy, why there is no molecular graph information involved and the reproducibility of the results without open dataset and scripts. The details about each point are presented in the above review sections. Cite this review as

I recommend to insert a short section to compare this method with other alignment-free methods used to predict enzyme classes or even second level enzyme sub-classes. In this sense, I recommend to insert an discuss briefly a summary comparative table including items like: number of sequences studied, type of structural information considered (sequence, 3D structure), Machine learning methods used (ANN, LDA, etc), type of structural parameters (entropies, moments, etc.), number of classes or sub-classes of enzymes predicted.

The paper is well written however, I may suggest authors change "increased" with "have been increasing" in the line 1 of the abstract. The Introduction between line 24 and 38 is short and the authors should consider also the papers aimed at the prediction of the first EC number using a 3D approach.

Validity of the findings
label_votf_3
The method used by the authors seems to be robust and consistent. However, I think authos should provide more data supporting the robustness of the approach like the ROC curve, the Matthews correlation coefficient, etc. In addition, I think the authors should further discuss the results and the significance of the features in the prediction models. Moreover, it is not clear for me if the authors applied any kind of feature selection or the models will include all the features they calculated.
