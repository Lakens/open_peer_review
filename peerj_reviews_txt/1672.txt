Review History The effect of agmatine on trichothecene type B and zearalenone production in Fusarium graminearum , F. culmorum and F. poae To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

In the present paper, the authors want to shed light into the regulatory network of trichothecenes by investigating the importance of specific AA in this process. I have several major comments that I feel are overlooked by the authors, and therefore, the paper is not acceptable for publication. 1. In the abstract, the authors say that other species produce DON and other type B trichothecenes, to my knowledge, F. poae is not a DON producer. 2. It is well known that F. poae produces type A and type B trichothecenes (see paper by Moretti and coworkers). This means that when you only look at a specific subset of toxins, you can never have an idea of the total titer of trichothecenes produced. In this way, you should also verify DAS, NEO,... 3. In the introduction, the authors mention inducers of trichothecenes, still this list is very short, other factors that are known to influence this are not mentioned e.g. light, fungicides, aw value, ...all aspects that have been addressed by other research groups. 4. What is meant with a "moderate toxin producer", this totally not scientific. What do the authors mean with moderate. 5. I do not understand why all the toxins are summed up. especially ZEN which is a structurally totally different toxin. Also the baseline production of trichothecenes (ppm levels) is completely different from that of ZEN (ppb range). So the picture represented is not correct. 6. for me, it is not clear whether the toxin data were calculated taking into account the fungal biomass. 7. statistics: how can you investigate variance and normality by box and Q-Q plot, the authors should use statistical tests. Figures illustrate already that variances are not equal between isolates, so all data should have been investigated using a non-parametric approach Cite this review as
