Review History Molecular response of canola to salt stress: insights on tolerance mechanisms To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

Minor Revisions
Based on the unanimous opinion of 3 reviewers and my own reading, it is clear that you are presenting an interesting and important review, which is generally well-written, is of broad interest, and will be a useful addition to the field. Some minor issues are raised by two reviewers and obviously they need to be addressed. Please pay close attention to the reviewer #3 request to provide a clear description of different techniques you are discussing in your article. Probably, a good idea would be to have a special section, in which various techniques are introduced and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed.

In this review, the authors focused on studies of the molecular response of canola to salinity to unravel the different pieces of the salt response puzzle. The paper includes a comprehensive review of the latest studies, particularly of proteomic and transcriptomic analysis, which will be helpful for understanding the mechanisms of salt tolerance and cultivating the salt tolerant canola varieties. However, this manuscript still has some content need to be modified or explanted.

Comments for the author
1.Line 468-470: the authors introduced that the report examines the results of proteomic, transcriptomic, genetic engineering, QTL mapping, and genetic studies to put together current understanding of canola salt response. However, there is no description of QTL mapping in the text, and there is less explanation in transcriptome. Could you please make an explanation? 2.line 479-486: in this paragraph, the author introduced many methods, and told us that the progress of these methods will remarkably help to elucidate the unknown or less-known aspects, whether the author can explain in detail how they can be applied in future studies. 3.In the paragraph of ‘Dynamic Changes of Canola Transcriptome and Proteome. This section describes the transcriptome dynamic change rarely, only discussed in proteomics level. Could you please add some content about dynamic changes of canola transcriptome? 4. line142 ‘root and leaves’ was changed to ‘roots and leaves’. 5. line250 ‘root and leaves’ was changed to ‘roots and leaves’.
