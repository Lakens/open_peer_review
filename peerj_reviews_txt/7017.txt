Review History In vitro performance in cotton plants with different genetic backgrounds: the case of Gossypium hirsutum in Mexico, and its implications for germplasm conservation To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

This revised manuscript has been improved in quality. And the explanation and information have been provided as well as the modification of statistics analysis. Now, the manuscript is clearly stated and well organized. There are two questions to be considered in revising this manuscript. 1.The microoganisms growing the explants are not always endophyte. Thus, authors should give “possible” term to state the performance. 2.The ELISA data seem to be missing, which should be added in supplemental file. In fact, the integrated analysis of W, WT, D and DT may be better than by-pairs analysis. Cite this review as

I read your new version of the article with great interest and noticed the more adequate title, however, I have two small comments: 1.- I consider the use of superlatives in the abstract to be unusual, therefore I suggest the elimination on line 41 of the word “strongly” 2.- On line 88; I suggest “some authors” to be changed to “an author”, or add other arguments here, because they cited a Hypothesis and Theory Article, lacking any experiments, since I take this information with reserves. I invite the authors to change arguments or add other citations.

I invite authors to discuss more closely and explain in what way the presence of these transgenic elements cause a detriment to germplasm and its in vitro culture. Cite this review as

Dear author I can read that you have addressed most of the reviewers concern. The title has changed. The reviewers comments have been responded adequately and your manuscript has improved through language edititing. Nevertheless, statistics is still a concern, and most importantly, you did not follow my editorial recommendation about the figures. Normalizing requires the calculation of standard deviation. Dividing through the maximal value is like a percentage. Why transform the data? Why not show all the data? I insist on my previous request: Please prepare new figures that have the unit of measurement of each trait. You cannot mix units of centimeters with units of microbial growth or number of leaves. Prepare one figure for each trait, containing four columns of data from W, Wt, D and Dt. De-transform your data and show the data with the original units and scale of measurements. Too much transformation and normalization generates the suspicion that the experimental data is not robust and there is something hidden. For publication in PeerJ, statistical rigor and data reliability are maximum priorities.

The manuscript is acepted in English language. Authors give sufficient references to describe the field of this study. The hypothesis about effective of transgene presence on cotton biodiversity is an good, but the results can not robust support it.

This manuscript designed the experiment to evaluate effective of transgene presence on cotton biodiversity change. Authors examined the differences of five in vitro culture performance traits between W and D, Wt and W, WT and D, WT and DT through PERMANOVA and NMDS tests. However, the results of statistic tests are simple, and can partially reveal the effective of transgene performance on the G. hirsuturm and wild diversities. Thus other analyses must be added to in detail evaluate the effective. Some comments followed below: 1.Based on the statistic tests of ANOVA, authors add multiple comparison tests among individuals of W, WT, D, and DT groups. 2.The title is unfit for the results, please revise it. 3.The running title is missing. 4.Line 99, Gossypium hirsutum should be omitted into G. hirsutum for the second presence in main text. 5.Line 246 and line 253 and so on, “three out of the five in vitro performance traits ” and “four out of the five analyzed traits” and so on, what are these different in vitro performance traits? Reviewer could not identify them only from Figures. 6.In Figure 2a, microbial growth comparison is wrong in label line. Cite this review as

I suggest the article to be revised by a native English speaking editor to improve the scientific vocabulary and grammatical format used to write.
Experimental design
They use population controls of domestic transgenic and wild type plants that are non-related. Therefore, I recommend using same genetic background samples in experiments. On the other hand, the authors do not consider position insert of the genome transgene, since a gene doesn’t characterize a specific phenotype. Moreover, there are possible implications on genome variants (SNP) over populations and the possible implications associated to in vitro culture. As well, it is necessary to determinate the endophytic bacteria or fungus that grew to correctly interpret the results. Research suggests the existence of advantages and disadvantages of the interaction between cotton plants and microorganisms, where there might be different results in in vitro culture.
Validity of the findings
The aim of the article is to evaluate in vitro culture advantages and disadvantages of transgenic and non transgenic cotton populations. However, the results are speculative due to the methods being control lacking.

Because of these reasons, I recommend the results given to be improved before the article is ready to be issued. Cite this review as
