Major Revisions
I apologize for the long delay before a decision could be taken. This was due to the necessity to review your paper in depth, including by myself. I concur with the opinions of the reviewers but would add a few comments. First, your discussion is MUCH too long and often errs in repeating what is in the Introduction and the Results section. A discussion should not be the place to restate what the results are but to critically discuss them. Second, there are many acronyms which makes the reading difficult. Please check and remove those that are not essential and used more than at least 10 times in your manuscript. Lastly, define exactly what are "care givers" (parents, family ..) and health care workers (doctors, pharmacists, nurses...).

1. The discussion section would benefit from the inclusion of headings 2. Data collection (92) the inclusion of open---ended questions suggests that this has qualitative as well as quantitative components. The section needs to be revisited. Please see below a more detailed explanation of a mixed---methods approach: (check title to reflect data collection method). If including qualitative components need section on analysis of the data; did the interviewer record/was consent given. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data: Mixed methods begins with the assumption that investigators, in understanding the social and health world, gather evidence based on the nature of the question and theoretical orientation. Social inquiry is targeted toward various sources and many levels that influence a given problem (e.g., policies, organizations, family, individual). Quantitative (mainly deductive) methods are ideal for measuring pervasiveness of "known" phenomena and central patterns of association, including inferences of causality. Qualitative (mainly inductive) methods allow for identification of previously unknown processes, explanations of why and how phenomena occur, and the range of their effects (Pasick et al., 2009). Mixed methods research, then, is more than simply collecting qualitative data from interviews, or collecting multiple forms of qualitative evidence (e.g., observations and interviews) or multiple types of quantitative evidence (e.g., surveys and diagnostic tests). It involves the intentional collection of both quantitative and qualitative data and the combination of the strengths of each to answer research questions. 3. See title: the data presented reflects the opinions of HCWs rather than practices rather practice/experience(as per limitations section) Be clear on this throughout and ensure that the discussion reflects this. What percentage had had direct experience of the process? In addition, see the annotated manuscript for line by line edits Cite this review as

The manuscript presents the data of a very important problem. Unfortunately nothing changed since I did my study. The manuscripts confirms the lack of knowledge not only from the parents but also from the HCW site. The manuscript is well written. I found only two typos: one in the abstract: last sentence the word the was written t he and in the text line 51 I think it should be disclosure with HIV ... rather than to? Cite this review as
