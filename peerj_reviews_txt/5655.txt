Review History Inflammation-based prognostic scores predict the prognosis of locally advanced cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients receiving curative concurrent chemoradiotherapy: a propensity score-matched analysis To increase transparency, PeerJ operates a system of 'optional signed reviews and history'. This takes two forms: (1) peer reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to provide their names (if they do so, then their profile page records the articles they have reviewed), and (2) authors are given the option of reproducing their entire peer review history alongside their published article (in which case the complete peer review process is provided, including revisions, rebuttal letters and editor decision letters).

In this study, the authors aim to determine the clinical impact of inflammation-based prognostic scores in locally advanced cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who have undergone curative CCRT. Patient data were collected retrospectively in the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January 2005 and December 2015. This study may be interesting for oncologists who are mainly interested in ESCC. The ethical approval and consent to participate are available in the manuscript. However, the paper needs additional works, and some minor changes are recommended before considering the paper for publication.

I also attached the Turnitin report for plagiarism check. The similarity index at the 33rd page of the Turnitin Originality Report was 40%, and this value exceeded acceptable level range between 15%-20%. Authors must be careful about citing papers appropriately in their study.

My concerns are as follows: In abstract, •In Line 38-42: Please give details for statistical methods in methods section of the abstract. •In Line 43: Please correct “(N=0.013)” as “(P=0.013)”. In introduction, •In Line 67: I think the reference for this sentence is missing. In material and methods, •In Line 135 and 137: The reference of (Edge S) should be corrected as (Edge S et al. 2010). In results, •In Line 217: Please correct “(N=0.013)” as “(P=0.013)”. •In Line 216: Table 2 should be refereed in line 216. In references, •In Line 375: This reference was not cited in the manuscript. In Table 2 and 3, •Please write the phrase “*Statistically significant” in the footnotes of the tables (same as Table 1). •To be consistent, please use 2 or 3 digit for decimals of the p-values (P value 0.047 or 0.04). In Figure 2, •To be consistent, please use 2 or 3 digit for decimals of the p-values (P value 0.010 or 0.01).

The study population was overwhelmingly male. Was this particularly chosen in order to match the cervical and thoracic ESCC patients, or is it because more men are affected by ESCC than female? A couple of sentences in the Discussion explaining whether there is a bias in the data due to an overwhelming male study cohort would be beneficial. Cite this review as

This manuscript by Chia-Che Wu et Al. is a retrospective study to identify the prognostic signi<U+FB01>cance of in<U+FB02>ammatory biomarkers on patients with cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, a relatively rare disease. The result shows many easily assessable biomarkers which relate to worse survival of these patients. There are points in which this study can be adjusted to be more bene<U+FB01>cial. 1. The reference pattern is not standard. Please follow the journal instructions. 2. Your introduction, in line 76-77, is not quite accurate, when standard protocol to date stated clearly on which patients with cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are indicated for surgery. 3. In line 135-137, 205, 289, The sentences are incorrect. 4. The eligibility criteria may need to be clari<U+FB01>ed when <U+FB01>rst criteria is the patients included are stage III. Firstly, according to 8th AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, T4 tumors are classi<U+FB01>ed into stage IV. According to your data, the majority of patients included had T4 tumor stage. Secondly, squamous cell type should be included in the criteria. 5. Other parameters that concern survival should be shown, such as ECOG status and underlying diseases, since they are confounders to the study outcome. 6. These biomarkers are easy-to-measure and can be very helpful if the comparative group are di<U+FB00>erent treatment modalities. 7. The cut-o<U+FB00> values of each biomarkers should be calculated because the cut-o<U+FB00> values depend on speci<U+FB01>c populations. 8. The conclusion should be based on results of the analysis. By concluding all biomarkers as a predictor for cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is misleading. Cite this review as
