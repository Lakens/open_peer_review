This manuscript suggests an innovative model for IDH1 R132H/Fibulin-5 pathway, which could
shed light upon the activity of IDH1 R132H in NSCLC. The experiments show that IDH1
mutation was present in tissues sampled from patients with NSCLC, which was inversely linked
to Fibulin-5 expression. This part is very interesting. However, this manuscript would greatly
benefit from proofreading for clarity.
Major Comments:
1. The Fibulin-5 protein expression results are not convincing, which invalidates some of the
conclusions. Figure 5 D indicates Fibulin-5 protein was not detectable in vector. However,
Fibulin-5 protein was detectable in si control (Figure 5G) and in H1299 according to figures 3D,
4B and 4D. This Figure 5 data is very important for the conclusions of the authors.
2. The authors should discuss the molecular mechanism: why IDH1 R132H is thought to enhance
proliferation and migration.
3. The authors suggest in Figure 1B that proliferation of H1299 cells transfected with IDH1 WT or
empty vector was inhibited (Figure 1B). It is not clear what the authors reference as a control.
4. What kind of mutant of IDH1 did the authors use in Figure 1D-F?
5. The authors should add the reference for previously demonstrated data from other groups. In
section 2.5, authors should indicate the source of the “previous results” with which their current
results agree.
Minor comments
6. Did the authors check the Fibulin-1 expression (Figure 3F)?
7. WB analysis of specific protein (Figure 4 legend) should list the specific antibodies.

In this manuscript, Yan et al. used lung cancer cell lines and showed that the IDH1 R132H
mutation, via the production of 2-HG, promoted cell proliferation and migration and suggested
that repression of Fibulin-5, due to promoter hypermethylation, was responsible for the effects on
cell proliferation and migration. Overall, the results are preliminary and more work needs to be
done to determine the significance of Fibulin-5 in mediating the effects of mutant IDH1, as well as
the mechanism involved in the regulation of Fibulin-5 expression.
Major issues:
1. As indicated by the authors, previous work has established that the IDH1 R132H mutation
leads to the production of 2-HG, which inhibits enzymes that rely on a-HG such as TET
proteins, resulting in DNA hypermethylation. Based on the results in Fig. 4, the authors
suggested that Fibulin-5 promoter methylation was due to increased DNMT1 binding. However,
the experiments were not well designed, and the interpretation of the data is problematic.
Specifically, DNMT1 is the major maintenance DNA methyltransferase and binds hemi-
methylated DNA. Given that 2-HG treatment leads to increased cell proliferation (thus increased
DNA replication-induced hemi-methylated DNA), it is expected that DNMT1 binding to Fibulin-
5 promoter (as well as many other regions) would be increased (Fig. 4A), which does not
necessarily mean that is responsible for hypermethylation. The role of TET proteins in Fibulin-5
promoter hypermethylation should be investigated.

2. In addressing the significance of Fibulin-5 in IDH1 R132H-induced cell proliferation and
migration, the authors used an artificial cell line (H1299 with IDH1 R132H overexpression) (Fig.
5D-I). Since H460 cells harbor the IDH1 mutation, it would be more relevant the test the effects of
Fibulin-5 expression and IDH1 R132H inhibition (with AGI-5198) on H460 proliferation and
migration. Since the demethylating agent AzaC affects many genes and is toxic, it is not
convincing that the effects on cell proliferation and migration (Fig. 5A-C) were due to Fibulin-5
de-repression.
Minor issues:
Page 5, the statement that “Proliferation of H1299 cells transfected with IDH1 WT or an empty
vector was gradually inhibited” was not accurate. Based on Fig. 1B, cells transfected with WT
IDH1 or empty vector did not proliferate as rapidly as cells transfected with the R132H mutant,
which does not mean that their proliferation was inhibited (most likely, their proliferation was
unaffected compared to untransfected cells).
Page 5, the sentence “By contrast, IDH1 knockdown in H460 cells or IDH1 mutation in H1299
cells transfected with IDH1 R132H plasmid inhibited 2-HG production” is confusing. Based on
Fig. 2C, the sentence can be changed to “By contrast, IDH1 knockdown in H460 cells or treatment
of IDH1 R132H-expressing H1299 cells with AGI-5198 inhibited 2-HG production”.
Page 6, in the sentence “However, expression of mutant IDH1 instead of WT IDH1 repressed
Fibulin-1 expression (Fig. 3F)”. Fibulin-1 should be Fibulin-5.

Please address all of the referees' comments
Board Member's comments to Author(s):
The manuscript has been reviewed by two referees and their comments are provided here. Both
referees find the subject interesting, but are not convinced about the proposed mechanism
involving Fibulin 5. I agree with this and suggest that the authors more convincingly demonstrate
the significance of Fibulin-5 in mediating the effects of IDH1 R132H-induced cell proliferation
and migration. One referee points out that DNMT1 binding to promoters is expected to increase
following DNA replication, so this does not specifically implicate Fibulin-5. A second referee
points out that the immunoblot data on Fibulin-5 does not appear to be internally consistent. We
hope that these comments are helpful in suggesting conclusive experiments to determine whether
or not Fibulin 5 promoter methylation is relevant in this context.

Appendix A
Dear Dr. Editor,
We appreciate the insightful and constructive review of our manuscript
entitled “IDH1 mutation promotes lung cancer cell proliferation through
methylation of Fibulin-5" (MS# RSOB-18-0086). To address the raised issues,
we have performed a number of new experiments and extensively revised the
manuscript. The revised portions have been highlighted with red front in a
text file submitted, and the point-by-point response is detailed below:
Referee: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript suggests an innovative model for IDH1 R132H/Fibulin-5
pathway, which could shed light upon the activity of IDH1 R132H in NSCLC.
The experiments show that IDH1 mutation was present in tissues sampled
from patients with NSCLC, which was inversely linked to Fibulin-5
expression. This part is very interesting. However, this manuscript would
greatly benefit from proofreading for clarity.
Major Comments:
1. The Fibulin-5 protein expression results are not convincing, which
invalidates some of the conclusions. Figure 5 D indicates Fibulin-5 protein
was not detectable in vector. However, Fibulin-5 protein was detectable in si
control (Figure 5G) and in H1299 according to figures 3D, 4B and 4D. This
Figure 5 data is very important for the conclusions of the authors.
Response: Thanks for the careful reading. In Fig. 5D, we used the
western blot to show the transfection effect of Fibulin-5 plasmid by a shorter
exposure picture. To address the concern of reviewer, we just add longer
exposure picture, which showed the expression of Fibulin-5 in the control
transfection cells.
2. The authors should discuss the molecular mechanism: why IDH1 R132H is
thought to enhance proliferation and migration.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We just added a discussion about
IDH1 mutation in cell proliferation and migration, which is highlight with red
color.
3. The authors suggest in Figure 1B that proliferation of H1299 cells
transfected with IDH1 WT or empty vector was inhibited (Figure 1B). It is not
clear what the authors reference as a control.
Response: We are sorry for this inaccurate description, and have
corrected our statement in the results.
4. What kind of mutant of IDH1 did the authors use in Figure 1D-F?
Response: The H460 cells have IDH1 R132H mutation. We added the
western blot for IDH1 R132H in Fig. 1D, and the details in the results.
5. The authors should add the reference for previously demonstrated data from
other groups. In section 2.5, authors should indicate the source of the
“previous results” with which their current results agree.
Response: We added a reference in the result to support our statement.
Minor comments
6. Did the authors check the Fibulin-1 expression (Figure 3F)?
Response: We added the mRNA level of Fibulin -1 as suggested. Our
new data also showed that IDH1 mutation did not influence the expression of
Fibulin-1.
7. WB analysis of specific protein (Figure 4 legend) should list the specific
antibodies.
Response: We have specified the proteins analyzed in Figure legends.
8. The authors should add the gene name in figures demonstrating relative
mRNA levels. Consistent spelling errors of “relative” in these figures.
Response: We have corrected the errors and added the gene’s name in
the figures.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, Yan et al. used lung cancer cell lines and showed that the
IDH1 R132H mutation, via the production of 2-HG, promoted cell
proliferation and migration and suggested that repression of Fibulin-5, due to
promoter hypermethylation, was responsible for the effects on cell
proliferation and migration. Overall, the results are preliminary and more
work needs to be done to determine the significance of Fibulin-5 in mediating
the effects of mutant IDH1, as well as the mechanism involved in the
regulation of Fibulin-5 expression.
Major issues:
1. As indicated by the authors, previous work has established that the IDH1
R132H mutation leads to the production of 2-HG, which inhibits enzymes that
rely on a-HG such as TET proteins, resulting in DNA hypermethylation.
Based on the results in Fig. 4, the authors suggested that Fibulin-5 promoter
methylation was due to increased DNMT1 binding. However, the experiments
were not well designed, and the interpretation of the data is problematic.
Specifically, DNMT1 is the major maintenance DNA methyltransferase and
binds hemi-methylated DNA. Given that 2-HG treatment leads to increased
cell proliferation (thus increased DNA replication-induced hemi-methylated
DNA), it is expected that DNMT1 binding to Fibulin-5 promoter (as well as
many other regions) would be increased (Fig. 4A), which does not necessarily
mean that is responsible for hypermethylation. The role of TET proteins in
Fibulin-5 promoter hypermethylation should be investigated.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We agreed with the opinion of
reviewer that the increase of DNMT1 binding with Fibulin-5 promoter might
be raised by the cell proliferation induced by 2-HG. However, our result in
Fig. 4A showed a dramatic enhancement of DNMT1 binding with Fibulin-5
promoter, which is far more than the increase of proliferation induced by 2-
HG. As to the function of TET2, we added TET2 knockdown experiment, and
found that depletion of TET2 did not affect the expression of Fibulin-5 with or
without 2-HG treatment, which might rule out the effect of TET2 in promoter
methylation of Fibulin-5.
2. In addressing the significance of Fibulin-5 in IDH1 R132H-induced cell
proliferation and migration, the authors used an artificial cell line (H1299 with
IDH1 R132H overexpression) (Fig. 5D-I). Since H460 cells harbor the IDH1
mutation, it would be more relevant the test the effects of Fibulin-5 expression
and IDH1 R132H inhibition (with AGI-5198) on H460 proliferation and
migration. Since the demethylating agent AzaC affects many genes and is
toxic, it is not convincing that the effects on cell proliferation and migration
(Fig. 5A-C) were due to Fibulin-5 de-repression.
Response: We added the Fibulin-5 knockdown or overexpression in
H460 cell as suggested by reviewer. Our new data suggested that inhibition of
IDH1 in H460 cells recovered the expression of Fibulin-5, which also
suppressed the cell proliferation and migration (Fig. S1). However,
knockdown of Fibulin-5 abolished the effects of IDH1 inhibition by AGI-
5198 (Fig. S1). We also transfected H460 cells with Fibulin-5 plasmid to
enforce its expression. Consistent with the treatment of 5-Aza, the enhanced
expression of Fibulin-5 substantially suppressed the H460 cell proliferation
and migration. Therefore, our new data also support that Fiblulin-5 expression
mediates the IDH1 R132H induced cell proliferation and migration.
Minor issues:
Page 5, the statement that “Proliferation of H1299 cells transfected with IDH1
WT or an empty vector was gradually inhibited” was not accurate. Based on
Fig. 1B, cells transfected with WT IDH1 or empty vector did not proliferate as
rapidly as cells transfected with the R132H mutant, which does not mean that
their proliferation was inhibited (most likely, their proliferation was
unaffected compared to untransfected cells).
Response: We have corrected our statement to make the description more
accurate.
Page 5, the sentence “By contrast, IDH1 knockdown in H460 cells or IDH1
mutation in H1299 cells transfected with IDH1 R132H plasmid inhibited 2-
HG production” is confusing. Based on Fig. 2C, the sentence can be changed
to “By contrast, IDH1 knockdown in H460 cells or treatment of IDH1
R132H-expressing H1299 cells with AGI-5198 inhibited 2-HG production”.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We have corrected the statement.
Page 6, in the sentence “However, expression of mutant IDH1 instead of WT
IDH1 repressed Fibulin-1 expression (Fig. 3F)”. Fibulin-1 should be Fibulin-5.
Response: We have corrected the mistake.
Thank you again for considering the revised manuscript. We would
very much appreciate if the revised manuscript is acceptable for Open Biology,
and look forward to your favorable decision.
