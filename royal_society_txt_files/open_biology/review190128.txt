The manuscript by Moore and Townsend describes the impact of various factors on the gut flora
development at early stages (prenatal, infant, postnatal) of infants. While the authors chose an
interesting topic within the author’s research area, there are several aspects that can be improved
for better influence of this topic. My recommendation is major revision, please see my listed
comments below.
1. Content. The author discussed fairly well on three stages of infants, however, they missed
discussion on several important findings in some publications (Development of the Human
Infant Intestinal Microbiota, Temporal development of the gut microbiome in early childhood
from the TEDDY study, Temporal Development of the Infant Gut Microbiota in Immunoglobulin

2. Content. The development of infant microbiome is also affected by physical environment (e.g.
infant’s room), persons (e.g. father/relatives) with daily contact, et al. The authors should convey
a comprehensive impression regarding the development of gut microbiome.
3. Presentation. The authors spent much effort on the writing, however, neglected the importance
of illustration. This manuscript only has 3 simple displaying items, which is not enough for a
good presentation. Readers may get lost easily without summarizing tables/figures when
reading the educational writing.

Dear Dr Townsend,
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-19-0128 entitled "Temporal
Development of the Infant Gut Microbiome" has been accepted by the Editor for publication in
Open Biology. The reviewer has recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer's comments
and revise your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
3
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsob/for-authors for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
