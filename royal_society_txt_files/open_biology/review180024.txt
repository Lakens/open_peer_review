This manuscript is welcome, but in places somewhat uncritical. Despite the fact that it seems to
show that ER stress is not involved in AD, the title suggests otherwise. It should say: 'Lack of
involvement...' For tau, it must cite and critically discuss Radford et al., in addition to Abisambra
et al. Could the overexpression levels of mutant human tau have something to do with ER stress
induction (the Tg4510 line massively overexpresses mutant human tau)? What about the work on
human tauopathies? Were the ER stress antibodies used phosphorylation-dependent? If so, might
they have cross-reacted with hyperphosphorylated tau? What about ER stress in other human
diseases, where the filamentous deposits are hyperphopsphorylated (alpha-synuclein) versus
those where the protein deposits are not hyperphosphorylated (prion protein)? The APP lines are
knockin, but the PS19 line is transgenic. How do overexpression levels in PS19 compare with
those in Tg4510 mice?

This review addresses the role of the UPR in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. This is an
interesting overview that integrates the UPR with a specific neurodegenerative disorder, a topic
that has been recently highlighted (Gerakis and Hetz 2017 and 2018). The originality is that the
authors discuss the role of ER stress/UPR (sometimes contradictory) in the different models
mimicking human AD pathology. I would like to suggest several changes to improve its
relevance and clarity. The introduction lays out key concepts of AD and UPR. My feeling is that
some aspects of the introduction would deserve to be detailed. A lot of information are reported,
however, one gets lost a little with effects that occur more or less specifically depending on
models. Schemes summarizing each paragraph would be helpful for the reader.
Specific comments:
-The paragraph concerning the description of the Alzheimer's disease is quite complete, pleasant
to read, the link with the endoplasmic reticulum is well introduced. In contrast, the ER
stress/UPR paragraph is too short. The RIDD activity of the IRE1 sensor should be mentioned.
The impact of UPR in aging should be developed. Regarding the relationship between the ER and
AD, a scheme would be required in order to increase the understanding and clarity of the
message.
-Even if data from literature are under debate, several schemes would be helpful to illustrate
paragraphs 2.3, and 3.
-I understand that the functional role of UPR in AD is complex, however, it is important to
distinguish that UPR is involved in distinct aspects of the pathology including synaptic
dysfunction, and the accumulation of aggregated proteins. I have the feeling that these two
aspects are not enough emphasized as well as the divergent role of IRE and XBP1s (Duran-Aniotz
C et al. 2017).
-Figure 1 has no legend, this point should be addressed. Moreover, the representation of the ER
sensors in FIG. 1 is wrong. ATF6 is not a protein kinase, and once activated, it migrates as a
monomer. It would be more accurate to represent the cleaved product: ATF6-p50 or ATF6c (for
active cleaved form). IRE1 is a kinase and is oligomerized, this is not well represented. Besides,
when XBP1 is spliced, the corresponding transcription factor is called XBP1s.
The categories of the target genes must be specified, the autophagy-related genes only concern
the PERK pathway. etc must be removed.
-CHOP and P-eiF2a expression levels in figures 2 and 3 respectively are not convicing
(multibands and very fuzzy signals).

Decision letter (RSOB-18-0024)
28-Mar-2018
Dear Dr Hashimoto,
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0024 entitled "Involvement of
Endoplasmic reticulum stress in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease" has been accepted by the
Editor for publication in Open Biology. The reviewer(s) have recommended publication, but also
suggest some minor revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the
reviewer(s)' comments and revise your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material (where applicable): this should be contained in a separate
file from the main text and meet our ESM criteria (see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-authors#question5). All supplementary materials
accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final form. They will be published
alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on
figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so that
the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
5
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section (if applicable)
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
