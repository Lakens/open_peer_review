This is an elegant and careful study that shows that the RFamide peptides and their receptors are
involved in a defensive behavior in Brachiopod larvae. The researchers deorphanize receptors for
these peptides and show their localization in the body.
Did desensitization of the response to FLRFamide also decrease the startle response? This would
help support the notion that FLRFamide is necessary, not just sufficient for the response. There
could be a parallel pathway that does not require this peptide.
Fig. 4, it is difficult to compare the dose response curves when they are horizontally arranged and
on different scales. It would be more conventional to put the plots on the same graph and label
them separately. Also, the square fit to DLRFamide looks artificial. It is probably caused by
having 7 data points with zero response. If you fit the curve without the 4 smallest values, then
the calculated EC50 will shift to a higher value.
Fig. 5. The labels are so small that I had to enlarge it 300% to read. There is no indication of what
the scale is; the scale in A is not labeled.
The discussion is only two paragraphs long. I think that paper could be improved by explaining
more about what these results mean in an evolutionary context. Why would a non-specialist care?

General comments
In this paper the authors report the discovery of a FLRFamide-type precursor and a FLRFamide-
type receptor in larvae of the brachiopod Terebratalia. The expression of the precursor and
receptor are mapped in larvae using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry.
Furthermore, the authors show that FLRFamide-type peptides induce a defense reaction (sinking
and extension of chaetae) and the ability of different FLRFamide-like peptides to trigger this
effect corresponds with their ability to activate the Terebratalia FLRFamide receptor when
expressed heterologously. Collectively, the data indicate that a FLRFamide-type neuropeptide
signaling system has a physiological role in Terebratalia larvae in triggering defense behaviour.
The findings of the study are interesting and the experimental data presented is of good quality
(although see some suggestions for improvements below). However, the paper could be
improved in a number of ways:
1. In the introduction it would be good to have a more detailed explanation of the rationale for
choosing to investigate neuropeptide signaling in a brachiopod.
2. To what extent is the effect of FLRFamide-like peptides in triggering sinking and extension of
chaetae unique to this signaling system? Were lots of other neuropeptides also tested? If they
were, what effects did they have. It would be useful for the reader to have some indication of
how unique the effect of FLRFamide-like peptides is.
3. The discussion is rather short. Perhaps the authors could add some thoughts on how the
findings of this study could be built upon to a). investigate neuropeptide signaling more broadly
in Terebratalia and b). investigate the effects of neuropeptides as regulators of defense reponses
in larvae of other taxa.
Specific comments
Line 10: Change “Animals behavior is composed out of spatially or temporally separated sub-
reactions” to “Animal behavior often comprises spatially or temporally separated sub-reactions.”
Line 11- replace “to” with “of”
Line 13 – replace “is widely used” with “has been widely analysed”
Line 13-14 “their function and role has only been studies for a few cases.” This statement needs to
be qualified. Clearly neuropeptide function has been extensively investigated in adult animals. I

assume the authors mean that neuropeptide in larval invertebrates has only been studied in a few
cases. If so, this should be stated.
Line 15 – replace “during” with “in”
Line 17 – reference is made to FLRFamide, but this is not the naturally occurring peptide in
brachiopods. It would be better to state that the endogenous FLRFamide-like peptides have been
identified in Terebratalia transversa (AFLRFamide, DFLRFamide) and that these peptides induce
protrusion of chaetae and sinking.
Line 19 Replace “We deorphanized the FLRFamide receptor and detected its expression in the
same tissues. Furthermore we used behavioral assays to identify the efficiency of modified
peptides in triggering this behavior.” with “We deorphanized the AFLRFamide/DFLRFamide
receptor and detected its expression in the same tissues. Furthermore, the ability of FLRFamide-
type peptides to activate this receptor was found to correspond with their ability to trigger
behavioral responses”.
Line 21 replace “single neuropeptide FLRFamide” with “FLRFamide-type neuropeptides”
Line 22-23 “It reveals how small modifications in the neuropeptide complement can lead to novel
behaviors during the evolution of larval stages.”
It is not at all clear to me what is meant by this statement. Here I think the authors may be
overextending the broader significance of their findings.
Line 29 “have evolved”
Line 35 replace “pointy” with “pointed” here and throughout the MS
Line 50 replace “their phylogenetic relationship is” with “their phylogenetic relationships are”
Line 54 replace “were it showed to have various muscular effects” with “where it has been found
to have various effects of muscular activity”
Line 56 replace “change the efficiency of” to “modulate the effects of”
Line 69 and 70 replace “homologues” with “homologous”
Line 71 replace “endogenous FaRP FLRFamide” with “endogenous FLRFamide-like peptides”
Line 75 replace “are specifically triggered by a single peptide via an ancient FaRP receptor” with
“can be specifically triggered by a single peptide acting via an ancient FaRP receptor”
Line 81 – state which year the animals were collected
Line 81 replace “in” with “at”
Line 82 change “meter” to “meters”
Line 82 – use of first person plural seems unnecessary here; recommend change to passive tense
throughout the materials and methods
Line 99 – replace “unconserved” with “non-conserved”
Line 106 – remove unnecessary hard return
Line 105 onwards – The behavioral assay should be described first. Then describe how peptides
were tested.
Line 115 – explain what vertical experiments are.
Line 121 – There is no information on how a cDNA encoding the Terebratalia FLRFamide
receptor was cloned and sequenced. This should be added
Line 155 – goat ant-rat? Do you mean goat anti-rabbit?
Line 159 – FLRFamide is not an endogenous neuropeptide in Terebratalia; AFLRFamide and
DFLRFamide are.
Figure 1 – It would be useful to include the sequence of the precursor, with colour coding of the
signal peptide, neuropeptides etc
Figure 4 – the dose-reponse curve for DFLRFamide looks odd; it is very steep. More data points
may be needed here.

This is an elegant and careful study that shows that the RFamide peptides and their
receptors are involved in a defensive behavior in Brachiopod larvae. The researchers
deorphanize receptors for these peptides and show their localization in the body.
Did desensitization of the response to FLRFamide also decrease the startle
response? This would help support the notion that FLRFamide is necessary, not just
sufficient for the response. There could be a parallel pathway that does not require
this peptide.
- This is a good point and we added our observation that desensitized larvae
are still able to show a defensive behavior. It seems like desensitized larvae have to
be disturbed more harshly than untreated ones and that larvae that are exposed to
very low concentrations of DFLRFamide seem to be more sensitive to disturbance
than untreated ones. These observations, however, were not quantified (which is of
course also mentioned in the text). We have added this point to the manuscript and
mention it now in the discussion.
Fig. 4, it is difficult to compare the dose response curves when they are horizontally
arranged and on different scales. It would be more conventional to put the plots on
the same graph and label them separately. Also, the square fit to DLRFamide looks
artificial. It is probably caused by having 7 data points with zero response. If you fit
the curve without the 4 smallest values, then the calculated EC50 will shift to a higher
value.
- We tried to combine all curves in a single graph, but due to the very similar
values of AFLRFamide, DFLRFamide and FLRFamide most points overlap strongly
and the curves are not clearly distinguishable anymore. Therefore we decided to
leave the graphs separate in the main manuscript and added the combined graph
into the Supplementary Material.
- We also re-calculated the DFLRFamide data without the lowest
concentrations, starting now with 1E-12 mol/l as for AFLRFamide and FLRFamide.
The EC50 shifted, as predicted, to a higher value (from 11.2 nmol/l to 26.5 nmol/l).
Fig. 5. The labels are so small that I had to enlarge it 300% to read. There is no
indication of what the scale is; the scale in A is not labeled.
- We have now increased the font size of the labels in the figure and added
the scale of the scale bar in the figure legend.
The discussion is only two paragraphs long.
I think that paper could be improved by explaining more about what these results
mean in an evolutionary context. Why would a non-specialist care?
- We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and we have now expanded the
discussion and added an additional paragraph where we discuss the evolutionary
context and other aspects of our study.

The findings of the study are interesting and the experimental data presented is of
good quality (although see some suggestions for improvements below). However,
the paper could be improved in a number of ways:
1. In the introduction it would be good to have a more detailed explanation of the
rationale for choosing to investigate neuropeptide signaling in a brachiopod.
- We have now added a better explanation in the introduction, mentioning the
importance of taxon sampling in Trochozoa and the evolutionary comparative
context.
2. To what extent is the effect of FLRFamide-like peptides in triggering sinking and
extension of chaetae unique to this signaling system?
Were lots of other neuropeptides also tested? If they were, what effects did they
have. It would be useful for the reader to have some indication of how unique the
effect of FLRFamide-like peptides is.
- We have now included a table of all tested neuropeptides in the
Supplementary Table 1 and reference it in the text. None of them induced a
protrusion of the chaetae. Some of them might have changed the vertical distribution,
however, we did not perform any replicates or quantified these reactions as it has
already been shown before that different peptides can change the ciliary-based
swimming in a single species (Conzelmann et al. 2011). We also discuss this point in
the evolutionary context.
3. The discussion is rather short. Perhaps the authors could add some thoughts on
how the findings of this study could be built upon to
a). investigate neuropeptide signaling more broadly in Terebratalia and
b). investigate the effects of neuropeptides as regulators of defense reponses in
larvae of other taxa.
- The very short discussion was also highlighted by reviewer 1 and we have
now expanded the discussion and focused on the evolutionary context and the use of
similar peptides in connection with similar behaviors.

Line 13-14 “their function and role has only been studies for a few cases.” This
statement needs to be qualified. Clearly neuropeptide function has been extensively

the identification of two endogenous FLRFamide-like peptides.
Line 19 Replace “We deorphanized the FLRFamide receptor and detected its
expression in the same tissues. Furthermore we used behavioral assays to identify

was found to correspond with their ability to trigger behavioral responses”.
- Corrected. We changed the second proposed sentence and added “…the
ability of native and modified FLRFamide-type peptides…”
Line 21 replace “single neuropeptide FLRFamide” with “FLRFamide-type
neuropeptides”

Figure 1 – It would be useful to include the sequence of the precursor, with colour
coding of the signal peptide, neuropeptides etc
- We added the sequence in the supplementary material and now also refer
to it in the main text. We color coded signal peptide, cleavage sites, amidation sites
and the predicted neuropeptides.
Figure 4 – the dose-reponse curve for DFLRFamide looks odd; it is very steep. More
data points may be needed here.
- We calculated the curve again without the first data points that show zero
reaction, as suggested by reviewer 1. The new curve looks normal and the EC50
value shifted slightly upwards (from 11.2 nmol/l to 26.5 nmol/l).
