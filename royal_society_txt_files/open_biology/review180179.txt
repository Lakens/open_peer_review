This manuscript [Eckert et al., RSOB-18-0179] utilizes zebrafish to study dynamic morphogenesis
of the eye, with a focus on understanding the mechanisms controlling formation and closure of
the ocular fissure. The authors present very convincing studies of the dynamics of cell
movements during optic cup morphogenesis. The mechanistic studies are well done, but present
little new information beyond the Knickmeyer paper published earlier this year in Open Biology.
Figures 1-3. Quantification is largely lacking for this dataset. For example, the types of cell
movements reported in figure 2 are intriguing and run counter to the prevailing literature
(though they are consistent with previous work from Picker and Heerman). To increase the rigor
of such analyses, it would informative to know what percentage of cells undergo such
movements. Is it 5% or 50%? Can it occur in adjacent cells or is that precluded?
Figure 5. Fig 4 of Knickmeyer (2018) previously utilized the same transgenic line, but began heat
shock at 21 hpf. In this pair of experiments Eckert et al. perform heat shock induction at 13 and 17
hpf (for 15 and 60 min respectively). It is unclear why the methodologies were so disparate in
terms of timings and readouts and this makes this figure very challenging.
Figure 5. the authors are not discussing the results of Bielen et al. (2012 Dev Cell), which
demonstrates that induction of BMP signaling will likely switch the fate of cells from eye to
telencephalic. Do they observe an alteration in rx3 expression in their experiments?
Figure 6. The images presented are in black/white, which complicates interpretations for
experiments when two transgenic readouts are included. The experiments should be discussed in
the context of the results of Veien et al (2009) rather than the mouse studies of porcupine.

ROSB-18-0179 Review:
In their manuscript entitled: “Morphogenesis and axis specification occur in parallel during optic
cup and optic fissure formation, differentially modulated by BMP and Wnt” the authors use the
zebrafish model to examine the morphogenetic regulation of optic fissure fusion. As noted in the
manuscript, this particular aspect of eye development has not been directly examined at length
and this work is a reasonable extension of the previous work from Heermann et al. 2015. Using
live time-lapse imaging, the authors show that cellular flow during optic vesicle development,
such as rim involution, is involved in establishing the two lobes of the optic fissure. Furthermore,
the authors clearly show that TGFb responsive retinal cells are involved in optic fissure
morphogenesis and that they originate from the optic stalk. Using genetic and pharmacological
means the authors also describe the consequences of BMP and Wnt modulation during optic
fissure formation and correlate those findings to effects on retinal axis patterning, in particular
the dorsal-ventral axis. Overall this work outlines some interesting and novel findings that
further our understanding of the morphogenetic process of early retinal formation that would be
of interest to the field at large. However, there are several major considerations.
While the manuscript depicts several interesting and novel aspects, in particular the association
of TGFb signaling with nasal fissure margins and the stalk, there are several areas where the
authors may have overstated their findings and potentially discounted additional pathways.
Major revisions and additional experiments would be required to address my concerns:
Major concern 1: In figure 1, the authors suggest that the photo converted cells display a
“gastrulation like rearrangement”, however when examining the movie and figures it is not clear
(at this level of resolution) that the labelled cells actually migrate from the lens averted to the lens
facing domain. The cells appear to elongate and/or possibly undergo IKNM (inter-kinetic nuclear
migration) rather than actually migrate. The authors continue to examine this phenomenon in
Figure 2 and movie 3, where again, I am not able to decipher any of the cells exhibiting this
motion. The movie lacks tracking data and is therefore difficult to understand how their
conclusion was formulated. When examining the SPIM data in figure 2 and movie 4, it is again
4
very difficult to follow the cells indicated for tracking. The movie and figure also lack detailed
land marks to orient the reader to which regions are being examined. Lastly, it was not indicated
in the manuscript as to the number of cells that were tracked, number of embryos and
experiments these tracks came from and therefore how replicable this observation was. There is
no disputing the ventral flow data, but the suggested migration of cells from the lens averted to
lens facing sides is not convincing and would need to be further supported.
Major concern 2: When examining the contribution of optic stalk cells to the optic fissure margins
the authors suggest that the cells undergo a “twist” and subsequent “vortex of cells”. This data
was depicted in figure 3. While it is clear that the optic stalk contributes cells to optic fissure
margins (Fig 3A-E), the data does not clearly depict the suggested movements depicted in figure
3H. Movie 6 very clearly depicts movements of cells, but those movements resemble rim
involution and the well accepted ventral flow type movements. There is a clear clustering of cells
but classifying it as a vortex may be confusing to readers. Overall, while the suggested
morphogenetic movements (Fig 3H) are plausible, the data as depicted do not support the
proposed model.
Major concern 3: The authors clearly show a drastic effect of BMP4 upregulation on optic fissure
formation, optic vesicle morphogenesis as a whole and TGFb signaling. However, it has been
well noted that BMP signaling is a dorsal patterning determinant and is therefore likely opposed
in the ventral domains Shh. As such, global expression of BMP4 generates a dorsalization event
which is not a normal occurrence. To better address whether BMP signaling drives optic fissure
formation, also examining BMP loss of function (either via mutant analysis or pharmacological
inhibition) would better serve our understanding whether BMP is directly involved in fissure
morphogenesis or whether its activity needs to be restricted from the ventral regions in order to
assure proper morphogenesis. In addition, the authors do not mention as to why they chose 13 or
17hpf as timepoints for initiating BMP4 (or the wnt inhibitor) expression. The rationale behind
their choice would be of importance since global activation of BMP signaling would have
significant implications on early development. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to have
images of the embryos post heat shock to visualize any gross morphological effects on whole
embryo development, especially eye size/shape etc. I would also suggest to have the BMP data to
have its own section/paragraph in the manuscript, separate from the Wnt work.
Major concern 4: The porcupine inhibitor treatment lacks controls. The only indication of its
global effect is found in supplemental figure 6, and clearly the embryo depicted is severely
affected, which can confound the results and conclusions drawn from the treatments. A dose-
response curve on the effects of the inhibitor is lacking, both in regard to morphology of the
embryos as well as to the effects on the TGFb reporter. In addition, while the authors claim that
Wnt is involved in regulating fissure morphogenesis, the reporter line used to confirm the
inhibitor treatment does not clearly show expression in either the dorsal or ventral region of the
eye (it appears to primarily mark neural crest cells). The authors should provide evidence that
Wnt signaling is active during this event in the tissues they are examining, as they have nicely
done in the case of TGFb signaling. Overall, pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling
resulting in major malformations is not a surprising finding and hard to interpret in regards to
specific molecular evens such as cell migration and flow.
Second, the authors show that TGFb responding cells no longer flow into the fissure margins
upon inhibitor treatment and suggest that this indicates all of the cells normally flowing to the
fissure are stopped. This should be supported by performing the photoconverstion experiments
(as in figure 3) to show that the flow of cells is in fact stopped rather than the possibility that
those cells simply no longer respond to TGFb signals.
Major concern 5: When examining the in situ data it is difficult in certain cases to analyze changes
5
in expression intensity due to the merging of channels. The DAPI signal is strong in some images
and weak in others, there is little consistency and when its strong it tends to mask the in situ
signal. In addition, there is no mention as to how prevalent the outcomes were, no n numbers or
numbers of embryos examined were provided. It is also difficult to compare treatments in Figure
9 A-F and M-R, as the inhibitor treated images appear to have a different orientation than the
DMSO controls.
General concerns:
- It was not clear why the authors chose BMP and Wnt as the only signaling pathways to analyze.
It is well known that other morphogens such as Shh and RA play a major role in the incidence of
coloboma (including vast clefts) and optic cup formation. The authors should make a clearer case
as to why only these two pathways were examined.
-Apart from measurements of OF length, the manuscript lacks detail as to the number of
experiments/embryos performed or any statistical measurement of the results, in particular for
live imaging.
-In Figure 1, the authors did not indicate why the particular regions of the retina were chosen for
activation and not others?
-Figures 2, 3 and 4 are missing a time line of procedures as depicted in Figure 1,5 and 6.
-In Figure 5 the authors examine bmp4 activation at 17 vs 13hpf, but the figure examines each
treatment with different reporters. The two timepoints should be examined using the same
reporters (either both with SBE:GFP/lyntdTomato or both with rx2:GFPCAAX) so that they can
be directly compared to each other.
-Figure 6 indicates inhibitor treatment as 10hpf, but the text refers to 13hpf.
-Figure 8 and 9 should be combined into one figure.
-Figure 10 should indicate the predicted time points for each of the proposed events.

Overall the authors were able to address several of my concerns, while others remain. New data
in the form of the BMP inhibitor expression and Wnt inhibitor dose response are great additions.
As was editing the existing figures and the text. Overall I still think the work is very interesting
and proposes some important concepts and findings, however, I feel that there is a lack of rigor in
several of the experiments, in particular the time-lapse tracking work. Having done the SPIM
experiment only once (in one embryo), is not sufficient. Too much variability could be attributed
to these results. Also, it remains unclear what the n numbers in the figures are referring to. For
example, for figure 3, the legend indicates an n of 10, but its not clear whether that is 10 different
embryos all done at once, 10 different embryos done in different experiments etc? I am also
concerned that the inhibitor studies were not repeated at least twice. While I am not questioning
the results per se, I feel its important to achieve proper scientific rigor for all experiments, which
typically involves 2-3 repeats of the experiments. If the authors can show more scientific rigor I
would be supportive of publication.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript [Eckert et al., RSOB-18-0179] utilizes zebrafish to study dynamic
morphogenesis of the eye, with a focus on understanding the mechanisms
controlling formation and closure of the ocular fissure. The authors present very
convincing studies of the dynamics of cell movements during optic cup
morphogenesis. The mechanistic studies are well done, but present little new
information beyond the Knickmeyer paper published earlier this year in Open
Biology.
First, we want to thank the referee for the positive comment on our data. In the
Knickmeyer et al paper, however, we addressed the role TGF<U+F062> signaling and BMP
signaling during optic fissure fusion. In part, the current manuscript is rather a follow
up on the Heermann et al paper (2015) in which we presented the “bilateral (distal)
neuroretinal flow” and also the role BMP antagonism plays there. Importantly, in the
current study we focus on the developing optic fissure, the morphogenesis of which
was largely elusive.
Figures 1-3. Quantification is largely lacking for this dataset. For example, the types
of cell movements reported in figure 2 are intriguing and run counter to the
prevailing literature (though they are consistent with previous work from Picker and
Heerman). To increase the rigor of such analyses, it would informative to know what
percentage of cells undergo such movements. Is it 5% or 50%? Can it occur in
adjacent cells or is that precluded?
The referee is right, a quantification of the overall flow movements was so far not
performed. The extent of the flow movements over the distal rims can be
appreciated in the paper of Heermann et al 2015. Tracking of future CMZ cells was
performed, also nicely showing the extent of cells which are secondarily integrated
into the lens-facing domain of the optic cup. The arrangement of cells before and
after the integration suggests, that adjacent cells can switch neighbors. In addition,
the secondary integration was more intense on the temporal side.
The focus of the current study, however, is the morphogenesis of the optic fissure
and its margins. In this context, we agree that a quantification of the secondary
integration of the stalk domain is highly interesting. We performed additional
experiments in which we used photoconversion of Kaede in the stalk domain and
analyzed the contribution of the stalk domain to the later optic cup. Please see the
revised version of the manuscript.
Notably, this issue was also raised very recently by a different group, published in
Gordon et al., 2018 (November). The contribution of the optic stalk domain was
estimated to be approx. 20% of the optic cup in a wildtype condition.
Figure 5. Fig 4 of Knickmeyer (2018) previously utilized the same transgenic line, but
began heat shock at 21 hpf. In this pair of experiments Eckert et al. perform heat
shock induction at 13 and 17 hpf (for 15 and 60 min respectively). It is unclear why
the methodologies were so disparate in terms of timings and readouts and this
makes this figure very challenging.
We thank the referee for this comment. In our analyses published in Knickmeyer et
al., we addressed the fusion of the fissure margins. In that context, we needed to
show that the transgenic line tg(hsp70::bmp4) is on the one hand sufficient to
recapitulate the morphogenetic defects observed in Heermann et al., 2015 and can
be used on the other hand to interfere with the fusion program. In the analyses of
Heermann et al., 2015 we used the cis regulatory element of rx2 to drive BMP4. The
onset of rx2 driven expression is approximately 12hpf. We made use of the
transgenic line tg(rx2::GFPcaax) to address the onset of expression.
Since we aimed to address the morphogenesis of fissure formation, it made sense to
us to apply heatshocks at 13 hpf and 17 hpf. We have seen an effect, which was
almost absolute at 13 hpf and milder later, at 17 hpf. This suggests a timing effect.
To further support the meaning of the BMP induced arrest of fissure morphogenesis,
we addressed the expression of a BMP antagonist, fsta, at different timepoints.
Notably, we found it expressed in the distal stalk domain (transition to the vesicle)
and the later ventral lens averted domain. This nicely represents the domains, which
are stuck after BMP induction. Please see the revised version of the manuscript.
Taken together, this indicates that BMP signaling must be reduced also for
secondary integration of the optic stalk domain.
The different protocols for heatshock application at different ages of the embryos
were needed, because the age of the embryos is affecting survival rate during these
experiments!
Figure 5. the authors are not discussing the results of Bielen et al. (2012 Dev Cell),
which demonstrates that induction of BMP signaling will likely switch the fate of cells
from eye to telencephalic. Do they observe an alteration in rx3 expression in their
experiments?
We thank the referee for pointing out the results of Bielen et al. While we have not
examined the expression of rx3 in our BMP overexpression model, we observe that
the expression of our rx2:GFPcaax reporter line seems unaltered within the forming
optic cup, except of course the morphogenetic changes resulting from BMP
induction. Please see Figure 5.
Rx2 at this point is a marker for retinal progenitor cells. Furthermore, the eyes of
BMP overexpressing embryos develop RPE and a layered neuroretina, even though
their morphology is severely affected (please also compare Figure 5 Supplement 3 of
the revised version).
The process of eye field specification and splitting occurs around 10 hpf, therefore
our treatments at 13 and 17 hpf are not able to interfere with them. The relatively
late heatshocks performed during our analyses, did not overall stall the “out-
pocketing” of the optic vesicle.
Figure 6. The images presented are in black/white, which complicates
interpretations for experiments when two transgenic readouts are included. The
experiments should be discussed in the context of the results of Veien et al (2009)
rather than the mouse studies of porcupine.
We are very sorry, that the referee obtained black and white images of the
submitted figure 6. Of course, the figure was submitted in color and we absolutely
agree with the referee, that data interpretation is hardly possible in black and white.
With respect to the discussion, we wanted to discuss both, Veien et al. and
Bankhead et al.. The latter was especially important to us because the data
published for the porcupine KO mice was the rational for us to address fissure
morphogenesis in the context of Wnt inhibition. Furthermore, the phenotypes
correlate nicely. The data of Veien et al., are also discussed in our manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
ROSB-18-0179 Review:
In their manuscript entitled: “Morphogenesis and axis specification occur in parallel
during optic cup and optic fissure formation, differentially modulated by BMP and
Wnt” the authors use the zebrafish model to examine the morphogenetic regulation
of optic fissure fusion.
As noted in the manuscript, this particular aspect of eye development has not been
directly examined at length and this work is a reasonable extension of the previous
work from Heermann et al. 2015. Using live time-lapse imaging, the authors show
that cellular flow during optic vesicle development, such as rim involution, is
involved in establishing the two lobes of the optic fissure. Furthermore, the authors
clearly show that TGFb responsive retinal cells are involved in optic fissure
morphogenesis and that they originate from the optic stalk.
Using genetic and pharmacological means the authors also describe the
consequences of BMP and Wnt modulation during optic fissure formation and
correlate those findings to effects on retinal axis patterning, in particular the dorsal-
ventral axis. Overall this work outlines some interesting and novel findings that
further our understanding of the morphogenetic process of early retinal formation
that would be of interest to the field at large. However, there are several major
considerations.
We want to thank the referee for the positive comment on our data.
While the manuscript depicts several interesting and novel aspects, in particular the
association of TGFb signaling with nasal fissure margins and the stalk, there are
several areas where the authors may have overstated their findings and potentially
discounted additional pathways. Major revisions and additional experiments would
be required to address my concerns:
Major concern 1: In figure 1, the authors suggest that the photo converted cells
display a “gastrulation like rearrangement”, however when examining the movie and
figures it is not clear (at this level of resolution) that the labelled cells actually
migrate from the lens averted to the lens facing domain. The cells appear to
elongate and/or possibly undergo IKNM (inter-kinetic nuclear migration) rather than
actually migrate.
We thank the referee for pointing out the potential misunderstanding. We agree
that the epithelial rearrangements (flow/migration) could potentially be mistaken
for interkinetic nuclear migration. In our data, however, it has to be considered that
we do not address nuclear labelled cells and that the cells only after they arrive in
the lens-facing domain, are able to stretch. The latter is, what we see in figure 1. We
observed flat cells in outer domains which over time stretch after they reached the
lens facing domain. Since we have a cytosolic label, the lens- averted cells must be
flat and the lens-facing cells must be stretched (connected basal and apical). Lens
facing and averted domains are oriented head to head. The dynamics have been
shown in Heermann et al., 2015.
The authors continue to examine this phenomenon in Figure 2 and movie 3, where
again, I am not able to decipher any of the cells exhibiting this motion. The movie
lacks tracking data and is therefore difficult to understand how their conclusion was
formulated. When examining the SPIM data in figure 2 and movie 4, it is again very
difficult to follow the cells indicated for tracking.
We agree with the referee, that especially the SPIM data can be difficult to analyse.
We, thus included tracking data. In order to direct the reader better annotations
have been implemented also into the movie file assembled from confocal data.
Please see the revised movie.
The movie and figure also lack detailed land marks to orient the reader to which
regions are being examined.
In order to provide better orientation, we included another landmark, the forming
lens, in the figure.
Lastly, it was not indicated in the manuscript as to the number of cells that were
tracked, number of embryos and experiments these tracks came from and therefore
how replicable this observation was. There is no disputing the ventral flow data, but
the suggested migration of cells from the lens averted to lens facing sides is not
convincing and would need to be further supported.
The continuous flow/migration of cells over the distal and ventral rim on the
temporal side of the forming optic cup, indicated in Figure 2 A-C, was observed in
many cases during conventional in vivo time-lapse confocal imaging (more than6
times). The further annotation in the movie file 3 is now better directing the reader.
To obtain a dataset with a very good resolution also in the z axis, the basis for good
cell tracking, we performed a SPIM imaging experiment. This was meant to show the
continuous flow/migration exemplarily with tracks.The overall distal flow/migration
is well documented in a previous paper, Heermann et al., 2015.
We have tracks for one SPIM set with 8 temporal tracks, 4 distal and 4 perpendicular
tracks
Major concern 2: When examining the contribution of optic stalk cells to the optic
fissure margins the authors suggest that the cells undergo a “twist” and subsequent
“vortex of cells”. This data was depicted in figure 3. While it is clear that the optic
stalk contributes cells to optic fissure margins (Fig 3A-E), the data does not clearly
depict the suggested movements depicted in figure 3H.
We agree with the referee, that the morphological changes the transition zone
undergoes before the stalk domain largely contributes to the forming optic cup, was
not well shown in figure 3. We now included the important stages in figure 3. The
triangular transition zone from the optic stalk to the vesicle is a crucial step. We
further clarified what we meant by “twist”. Please see the revised version of the
manuscript.
Movie 6 very clearly depicts movements of cells, but those movements resemble rim
involution and the well accepted ventral flow type movements. There is a clear
clustering of cells but classifying it as a vortex may be confusing to readers.
We thank the referee for this comment. We are glad that the rim movements as well
as the ventral flow movements are visible. The term “vortex” was chosen, because
over time the depicted ventral/nasal domain is undergoing a transient change of
morphology. This change of appearance, best seen in a movie file, looks like a vortex
of cells. This domain corresponds to the domain in which on the lens facing side the
rim movement and the stalk flow converge.
Overall, while the suggested morphogenetic movements (Fig 3H) are plausible, the
data as depicted do not support the proposed model.
Please see the new Figure 3.
Major concern 3: The authors clearly show a drastic effect of BMP4 upregulation on
optic fissure formation, optic vesicle morphogenesis as a whole and TGFb signaling.
However, it has been well noted that BMP signaling is a dorsal patterning
determinant and is therefore likely opposed in the ventral domains Shh. As such,
global expression of BMP4 generates a dorsalization event which is not a normal
occurrence. To better address whether BMP signaling drives optic fissure formation,
also examining BMP loss of function (either via mutant analysis or pharmacological
inhibition) would better serve our understanding whether BMP is directly involved in
fissure morphogenesis or whether its activity needs to be restricted from the ventral
regions in order to assure proper morphogenesis.
The referee is raising an interesting aspect. A dorsalization, resulting from a BMP
induction, is what we see and show indeed. This can be appreciated nicely in the
figure 7. Importantly, however, the dorsalization is not the only phenotype observed.
We can furthermore show clearly, that the flow movements, which we observed in
control fish, are arrested. Thus, domains are not properly integrated into the
forming optic cup. In the controls of figure 9, 8 and 7 we clearly show that the vax2
domain is primarily largely localized in the lens-averted domain and only later can be
found strong in the lens facing domain. After BMP induction, the vax2 domain is also
stuck in the lens averted domain. Please see figure 7 j-k.
To further support the meaning of the BMP induced arrest of fissure morphogenesis,
we addressed the expression of a BMP antagonist, fsta, at different timepoints.
Please see the revised figure 5.
Notably, we found fsta expressed in the distal stalk domain (transition to the vesicle)
and the later ventral lens averted domain. This does nicely represent the domains,
which are stuck after BMP has been induced. Taken together, our data indicate that
BMP signaling must be reduced also for secondary integration of the optic stalk
domain.
In addition, the authors do not mention as to why they chose 13 or 17hpf as
timepoints for initiating BMP4 (or the wnt inhibitor) expression. The rationale
behind their choice would be of importance since global activation of BMP signaling
would have significant implications on early development.
We thank the referee for this comment. In this study, we aimed to address the
morphogenesis of fissure formation. In part it can be seen as a follow up on the
manuscript published in 2015, Heermann et al. In the analyses of Heermann et al.,
2015 we used the cis regulatory element of rx2 to drive BMP4. The onset of rx2
driven expression is approximately 12 hpf We made use of the transgenic line
tg(rx2::GFPcaax) to address the onset of expression.
The heatshock inducible line enabled us to now use different onsets of BMP
induction. Thus, it made sense to us to apply heatshocks at 13 hpf and 17 hpf. We
observed an almost complete inhibition of optic fissure formation at 13 hpf and a
milder phenotype later, at 17 hpf. . Please see the revised version of the manuscript.
Furthermore, it would be beneficial to have images of the embryos post heat shock
to visualize any gross morphological effects on whole embryo development,
especially eye size/shape etc. I would also suggest to have the BMP data to have its
own section/paragraph in the manuscript, separate from the Wnt work.
We agree with the referee that images depicting the gross morphology of
tg(hsp70:bmp4) embryos would be helpful for readers. We have included such
images in Figure 5 Supplement 3 of the revised version.
Major concern 4: The porcupine inhibitor treatment lacks controls. The only
indication of its global effect is found in supplemental figure 6, and clearly the
embryo depicted is severely affected, which can confound the results and
conclusions drawn from the treatments.
A dose-response curve on the effects of the inhibitor is lacking, both in regard to
morphology of the embryos as well as to the effects on the TGFb reporter.
We included a dose response analysis we performed on zebrafish embryos in figure
6 supplement 2. We used a nuclear labeling and a membrane labeling for confocal
imaging. In addition, we show brightfield images. We focused on the morphology
and not on TGF<U+F062> reporter signal, which in case of figure 6 was meant as a stalk
marker. Please see the added figure and the included figure legend.
In addition, while the authors claim that Wnt is involved in regulating fissure
morphogenesis, the reporter line used to confirm the inhibitor treatment does not
clearly show expression in either the dorsal or ventral region of the eye (it appears
to primarily mark neural crest cells). The authors should provide evidence that Wnt
signaling is active during this event in the tissues they are examining, as they have
nicely done in the case of TGFb signaling. Overall, pharmacological inhibition of Wnt
signaling resulting in major malformations is not a surprising finding and hard to
interpret in regards to specific molecular evens such as cell migration and flow.
The referee is raising an interesting point. We were also surprised to see Wnt
signaling activation of the reporter in our hands mainly or solely within the neural
crest derived periocular mesenchymal (POM) cells. We think that the Wnt effect on
fissure formation could be an indirect effect. Although fissure morphogenesis could
happen with reduced numbers of crest derived POM cells (Gestri et al., 2018), it is
still elusive whether they are required or not.
We agree that per se Wnt inhibition could affect embryogenesis severely. However,
we addressed the morphogenesis via time-lapse imaging and show that per se the
early optic cup formation is occurring, but specific flow movements are hampered.
Furthermore, we show data (in situ) comparable to Veien et al. in line with a dorsal
maintenance defect.
Second, the authors show that TGFb responding cells no longer flow into the fissure
margins upon inhibitor treatment and suggest that this indicates all of the cells
normally flowing to the fissure are stopped. This should be supported by performing
the photoconverstion experiments (as in figure 3) to show that the flow of cells is in
fact stopped rather than the possibility that those cells simply no longer respond to
TGFb signals.
For this set of experiments we used the TGF<U+F062> signaling reporter as a marker for the
stalk domain. Even under the inhibition of porcupine we can still see the reporter
signal in the optic stalk domain. Nevertheless, the referee is right, that we cannot
totally exclude that a portion of cells which are moved into the optic cup could
potentially be unable to respond to TGF<U+F062> any longer and are thus not detectable.
However, we anyhow addressed the morphogenesis over time and can clearly show,
independent of any specific signaling reporter and purely focusing on the
morphology, that the stalk is not properly included into the optic cup.
Major concern 5: When examining the in situ data it is difficult in certain cases to
analyze changes in expression intensity due to the merging of channels. The DAPI
signal is strong in some images and weak in others, there is little consistency and
when its strong it tends to mask the in situ signal.
We are of course interested in an optimal visibility of the in situ labeling, however,
we also think that the orientation is also important to consider. Thus, we would like
to keep the merged channels for presentation.
In addition, there is no mention as to how prevalent the outcomes were, no n
numbers or numbers of embryos examined were provided.
We included numbers of experiments /embryos in the manuscript. Please see the
revised version of the manuscript. ( For each condition/treatment/probe 8 embryos,
were treated, 4-5 of them were confocaly imaged, one is depicted in the figure. )
It is also difficult to compare treatments in Figure 9 A-F and M-R, as the inhibitor
treated images appear to have a different orientation than the DMSO controls.
We changed the orientation in order to provide a better comparability.
General concerns:
- It was not clear why the authors chose BMP and Wnt as the only signaling
pathways to analyze. It is well known that other morphogens such as Shh and RA
play a major role in the incidence of coloboma (including vast clefts) and optic cup
formation. The authors should make a clearer case as to why only these two
pathways were examined.
The referee is raising a very interesting point. We think that many more pathways
play a role in optic fissure morphogenesis and “morphogenetic coloboma”. We
wanted to give examples to prove our hypothesis. We started to work on BMP
induction, since we knew from our previous work (Heermann et al., 2015) that BMP
antagonism is important for eye morphogenesis, specifically for the bilateral distal
flow/ rim migration. We now wanted to address the details of optic fissure
morphogenesis. During literature research we came across very interesting data of
Bankhead et al., 2015, presenting a similar phenotypic coloboma. We thus wanted to
investigate whether optic cup morphogenesis and optic fissure formation could be a
good explanation for the phenotype.
-Apart from measurements of OF length, the manuscript lacks detail as to the
number of experiments/embryos performed or any statistical measurement of the
results, in particular for live imaging.
We included numbers of experiments /embryos in the manuscript. Please see the
revised version of the manuscript.
-In Figure 1, the authors did not indicate why the particular regions of the retina
were chosen for activation and not others?
We marked different regions in the dorsal ventral and nasal temporal aspect, just to
demonstrate the rim movement during eye morphogenesis from a lateral
perspective.
-Figures 2, 3 and 4 are missing a time line of procedures as depicted in Figure 1,5 and
6.
In figure 3 a timeline is included. In figure 2 and 4 we did not see the necessity to
include timelines. No photoconversion was performed here. Additional information
is of course provided in the figure legends.
-In Figure 5 the authors examine bmp4 activation at 17 vs 13hpf, but the figure
examines each treatment with different reporters. The two timepoints should be
examined using the same reporters (either both with SBE:GFP/lyntdTomato or both
with rx2:GFPCAAX) so that they can be directly compared to each other.
We are aware that we used different labels for the experiments and data
presentation. However, it is also important to consider that we used a pan-retinal
membrane labeling in both experiments. The difference is that one is ubiquitous and
the other is more or less only pan-retinal. Nevertheless, the information regarding
the fissure morphogenesis defect can be seen independent of the specific labeling
used.
-Figure 6 indicates inhibitor treatment as 10hpf, but the text refers to 13hpf.
We thank the referee for pointing this out. We corrected the mistake.
-Figure 8 and 9 should be combined into one figure.
We agree that it would have advantages to combine the figures. However, that is
hardly possible due to the size.
-Figure 10 should indicate the predicted time points for each of the proposed events.
We appreciate the suggested inclusion. Please the revised figure 10 scheme.
