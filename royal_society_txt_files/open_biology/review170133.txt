This manuscript by Lortat-Jacob and colleagues reports the solution structure of native CXCL13
and Met-CXCL13, which differ by the addition of a single amino acid at the N-terminus. The
results suggest that CXCL13 dimerizes in the typical manner of other CXC chemokines, though
with slow exchange NMR kinetics that seems at odds with the weak self-association with a Kd in
the millimolar range. They also examine the interaction of CXCL13 with heparan sulfate by
modeling, SPR, NMR and mutagenesis, identifying two distinct GAG binding sites that account
for a portion of the binding energy. Overall, this is an exhaustive structure-function analysis of
murine CXCL13 that provides a great deal of new information, most of which is probably
relevant to the human ortholog as well, although that aspect of the study could be improved,
along with many other weaknesses that should be addressed in a future version. In particular, the
relevance of the surprising structural effect of one extra N-terminal amino acid to biological
activity and CXCL13 dimerization is left largely unexplored. For example, while removal of the
N-terminal Met from Met-CXCL13 evidently changes the kinetics of beta-strand formation, there
is likely still an equilibrium population of free and bound N-terminus which may explain the low
apparent dimer affinity. Additionally, while basic cluster 1 in the helix, but not the C-terminal
cluster 5, was found to contribute significantly (10-fold reduction) to the HS binding affinity, it
seems likely that other basic residues that were not interrogated by mutagenesis may also be
important (e.g. K10, K40) and should be probed more systematically. Other specific concerns and
suggested revisions are detailed below.
1. Throughout: Met-CXCL13 and CXCL13 can be expected to behave differently in nearly
all of the experiments performed; if CXCL13 is used for everything except the structural analysis
of Met-CXCL13, this should be made explicitly clear in the results section.
2. Line 263: Add the HSQC overlay as a figure in the supplemental materials.
3. Line 276: Fig S1 and S2 should be combined into a single figure and incorporated into the
main manuscript.
4. Table 1: residue ranges used for RMSD calculations should be indicated.
5. Fig S2B: What do the red and black contours represent? 2D ZZ exchange and normal
HSQC? This should be indicated in the legend.
6. Fig 2A. Add secondary structure icons.
7. Fig 2C. A surface view would be useful for illustrating the likely GAG binding regions.

8. Fig 2: A panel with HSQC spectral overlay showing the HS titration should be added.
9. Fig. S3: Correct the display of the methionine methyl group, which appears to be a CH2
group with sp2 hybridization.
10. Line 316: Met49 should be mutated to test the hypothesis that it hinders GAG binding, or
this speculative analysis should be moved to the discussion.
11. Line 429: Analysis of CXCL13 dimerization is lacking in several respects. An HSQC
overlay at different concentrations should be shown as a supplemental figure to illustrate the
slow exchange between monomer and dimer.
12. Line 440: Quantitation of binding from peak heights can be challenging. How were peak
intensities measured (maximum vs integrated intensity, e.g.)? The binding isotherm used to
estimate dimer Kd should be shown in a figure.
13. Line 443: If monomer and dimer are present in slow exchange, how were the dimer
resonances assigned?
14. By how much is the CXCL13 dimer Kd reduced in the presence of HS?
15. Line 470: Which double-mutant CXCL13 was used for cell binding measurements?
16. Line 556: ‘Low’ (here and elsewhere) is an imprecise description of binding affinity and
should be replaced with a more quantitative term.
17. Line 556: Why is association of the N-terminus with the beta-1 strand not mentioned as
an equally plausible disrupter of dimerization? The role of flexible N- and C-terminal sequences
in the low propensity for dimerization should be investigated by comparing truncated and full-
length sequences by 2D NMR.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
Interaction of chemokines with extracellular components was shown to play a role in their
presentation and distribution in the tissue. In this work Monneau and colleagues present work
aimed at investigate how heparan sulphate (HS) can regulate CXCL13 activity. To this end they
solved the solution structure of CXCL13 and present data concerning the mechanism of CXL13
dimerization upon HS-chemokine interaction. Relevant for this work, the authors showed before
in an in vivo context that CXL12 interaction with HS plays a role in the function of the
chemokine.
According to the presented results, CXCL13 can be presented to its receptor in a HS-bound form,
which is consistent with the idea that it functions in promoting cell adhesion. Indeed, based on
definition of the domains of the protein to which HS binds the authors constructed CXCL13
mutations in which they uncouple HS binding from CXCR5 signaling, showing that the two
features of the chemokine (HS binding and signaling) are separable and that the HS binding is
not required for signalling. The results thus potentially allow the evaluation of the role each one
of the two processes separately concerning the function of CXCL13. Another finding highlights
5
the importance of proper N-terminal protein sequence (the first Methionine) in dictating the
structure of the chemokine.
The paper is well written and the message is very clear. The results now allow the functional
analysis and dissection of the two different features of the protein and thus biologically
intersting. Such future work is likely to shed light on the precise mode of action of the CXCL13
chemokine in different contexts and is also interesting with respect to chemokine evolution, as
differences among different chemokines are described.
While the presented data appears interesting and of high quality, I would rely on structural
biologists referees to judge this aspect of the work.
For Figure 7, I would add a mutation affecting the signaling, such that there is a form that serves
as negative control in the experiment. In addition, for clarity, instead of the triangles and squares,
I would use different colors for the plots and indicate what each signifies within the panel itslf.
Minor points –
- The title of the paper “Solution structure of CXCL13 and heparan sulphate binding show that
GAG binding site and biological activity rely on distinct domains” means that the GAG binding
site has no biological activity, a point that was not really shown in the paper. Such a claim could
be examined by assaying the CXCL13 in the context of the whole animal.
- I would phrase the “Computational approaches were used to analyse the HS sequences
preferentially recognized by the protein and gain atomic level understanding of the CXCL13
induced dimerization observed upon HS binding.” In the abstract differently, as it might be
understood that the dimerization is induced by the chemokine.
- “Both HS and receptor binding sites of CXCL13 are distinct “ – I would delete the word “both”.

The authors have addressed the previous concerns and the current manuscript is suitable for
publication in Open Biology with minor revisions.
1. I recommend that the authors use the IUPAC accepted spelling of "sulfate".
2. Line 29 should read "a detail that remains elusive".
3. The authors mention that HS is comprised of GlcA, IdoA and GlcNAc/GlcNS. Then, they say
‘both’ can be sulfated (line 62). Please clarify which entities are sulfated.
4. Please provide a reference for the statement on "HS-mediated chemokine immobilization"
(lines 66-72).
5. Line 235 is empty after the word "cells". Please correct formatting.
6. Change the word ‘extend’ (line 314) to ‘extent’.
7. Please correct the grammar in the sentence "However, although CXCL13 was incubated at high
concentration (3 µM) in the cross-linking approach, a method that was shown to identify low
affinity binding sites [18]" (lines 314-316).
8. The authors use different designations: ‘40s’ (line 316) and ‘40’s’ (line 521). Please use the same
nomenclature throughout the paper.
9. Please highlight the 40s loop in the sequence of one of the figures to improve clarity.
10. The authors chose to mutate basic residues that show the highest CSPs. Please comment on
why other residues (non-basic) that exhibit high CSPs were not probed by mutagenesis?
11. Please comment on the physiological relevance of dimerization, given the low affinity?
12. Please correct the grammar in the statement ‘which structure are still unknown’ (line 578).
13. In the legend for Figure 4, the authors fail to explain what the grey line is. Also, the grey trace
is absent in panel A of Figure 4.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript by Lortat-Jacob and colleagues reports the solution structure of native
CXCL13 and Met-CXCL13, which differ by the addition of a single amino acid at the N-
erminus. The results suggest that CXCL13 dimerizes in the typical manner of other CXC
chemokines, though with slow exchange NMR kinetics that seems at odds with the weak self-
association with a Kd in the millimolar range. They also examine the interaction of CXCL13
with heparan sulfate by modeling, SPR, NMR and mutagenesis, identifying two distinct GAG
binding sites that account for a portion of the binding energy. Overall, this is an exhaustive
structure-function analysis of murine CXCL13 that provides a great deal of new information,
most of which is probably relevant to the human ortholog as well, although that aspect of the
study could be improved, along with many other weaknesses that should be addressed in a
uture version. In particular, the relevance of the surprising structural effect of one extra N-
erminal amino acid to biological activity and CXCL13 dimerization is left largely unexplored.
For example, while removal of the N-terminal Met from Met-CXCL13 evidently changes the
kinetics of beta-strand formation, there is likely still an equilibrium population of free and
bound N-terminus which may explain the low apparent dimer affinity.
Thank you for this remark. While the Met-CXCL13 mostly displays a folded N-terminal
domain (90 % of the population at 100 µM, as measured from peak volume ratio of amino-acid
probes, such as Ile29), the wt-CXCL13 spectrum does not show any detectable characteristic
esonance of a folded N-terminus within the limit of NMR experiment sensitivity (approx. 2
%). This enables us to conclude that a remaining equilibrium is unlikely to explain the low
apparent dimer affinity of the wt-CXCL13. Additionally, we also observed that <U+2206>N-CXCL13
CXCL13 from which the first 9 residues were removed) also features a low apparent dimer
affinity (new Fig. S7). This is now indicated lines 424-426.
Additionally, while basic cluster 1 in the helix, but not the C-terminal cluster 5, was found to
contribute significantly (10-fold reduction) to the HS binding affinity, it seems likely that other
basic residues that were not interrogated by mutagenesis may also be important (e.g. K10, K40)
and should be probed more systematically.
We agree that K10 and K40, which in the folded protein are close to each other, could have
been considered as a putative HS binding site. However, our cross-linking approaches clearly
ndicated that they do not participate in HS recognition. This method (see reference 18), which
accuracy and sensitivity have been validated with several HS binding proteins
CCL5/RANTES, the envelope glycoprotein gC from pseudorabies virus, the laminin-5
a3LG4/5 domain, the HIV-1 gp120), was shown to pick up either high or low affinity binding
sites, depending on the concentration of protein used. In particular, our previous work with the
chemokine CCL5, used at either 300 nM or 10 µM enabled us to identify two distinct binding
sites characterized by high and low affinity respectively. In the present work, K10 and K40
were never picked up with CXCL13 used at up to a 3 µM concentration, ruling out a significant
ole in HS recognition for these residues. On this basis, only the clusters 1 and 5 were thus
considered as HS binding sites. Hence, mutagenesis of these two clusters were performed to
nvestigate their respective contributions to the binding affinity. We would also like to point
out that the CSP that these two residues undergo during titration experiments could be induced
by other events, such as dimerization for example. Few sentences have been introduced, lines
306-309 to better explained these results.
Other specific concerns and suggested revisions are detailed below.
1. Throughout: Met-CXCL13 and CXCL13 can be expected to behave differently in
nearly all of the experiments performed; if CXCL13 is used for everything except the structural
analysis of Met-CXCL13, this should be made explicitly clear in the results section.
Met-CXCL13 and CXCL13 behave differently for the folding of the N-terminal domain and
consequently for the concentration at which these two samples dimerise. However, the N-
erminus has no influence on binding to HS (Met-CXCL13 and <U+2206>N-CXCL13 - see below -
display identical affinity).
For this work we have prepared four different CXCL13 constructs that were used for different
purposes. This includes Met-CXCL13, CXCL13, <U+2206>N-CXCL13 and CXCL13-<U+2206>C. The two
atter constructs lack the first 9 and last 14 residues respectively (and include an initiating
methionine).
CXCL13 was used for establishing the structure of the "unfolded N-terminus CXCL13", the
HS binding on cell surface and the bioassays.
Met-CXCL13 gave rise to a complex spectrum featuring 3 populations comprising the "folded
N-terminus CXCL13", the "unfolded N-terminus CXCL13" and the "CXCL13 dimer". <U+2206>N-
CXCL13 was thus constructed to simplify the attribution of the core domain of CXCL13, in the
absence of the folded N-terminus. It was also used to identify the resonances of the dimer, in
SPR binding studies (new data, see below), and to show that the N-terminus has no impact on
he binding to HS and (to reply to a question of reviewer 2) is necessary to bioactivity.
CXCL13-<U+2206>C was used for investigating the possible existence of an interaction between the C-
erminus and the core domain of the chemokine.
Finally, Met-CXCL13 was used for establishing the structure of the "folded N-terminus
CXCL13", and to characterise the exchange between the folded and unfolded N-terminal
domains. We have also used this sample (rather than CXCL13) in NMR-based HS binding
experiments, as it poorly dimerises and thus enabled following of the CSP on the basis of the
monomer structure.
The possibility of using this sample in binding experiments is supported by the fact that the HS
binding regions (clusters 1 and 5) are not modified by the folding of the N-terminal domain. In
addition, as indicated above, we have also compared the SPR data between Met-CXCL13 and
<U+2206>N-CXCL13 and found no difference in affinity.
These explanations have now been introduced in the manuscript and the identity of the samples
used for each experiment has been explicitly indicated throughout the manuscript. Thank you
or raising this point, that was indeed not sufficiently clear in the initial version of our text.
2. Line 263: Add the HSQC overlay as a figure in the supplemental materials.
The HSQC overlay has been added to the supplemental material (new Fig. S2).
3. Line 276: Fig S1 and S2 should be combined into a single figure and incorporated
nto the main manuscript.
Combining Fig S1 and S2 would have generated a very large (10 different panels) and, to our
view, poorly comprehensive figure. This would also very significantly increase the size of the
manuscript main text with a message (please see the Fig S3 legend describing the structure and
dynamic of Met-CXCL13) that is not within the main focus of our work. We nevertheless fully
agree that the comparison between the murine CXCL13 and the human Met-CXCL13 (Fig. S1)
s of interest. We have thus introduced the Fig. S1 into the main manuscript (now Fig. 2) and
kept Fig. S2 (now Fig. S3) in the supplementary material.
4. Table 1: residue ranges used for RMSD calculations should be indicated.
All residues were used for RMSD calculations. Table 1 -and also table S1- have been modified
accordingly.
5. Fig S2B: What do the red and black contours represent? 2D ZZ exchange and normal
HSQC? This should be indicated in the legend.
Thank you for having pointed out this omission. The red and black contours represent 2D ZZ
exchange spectra at 1 and 0 second, respectively. This is now stated in the figure legend.
6. Fig 2A. Add secondary structure icons.
Thank you for this suggestion. We have introduced the secondary structure icons in this figure
now Fig.3), however this has been done in Fig.3C rather than Fig.3A, which would otherwise
have been overloaded.
7. Fig 2C. A surface view would be useful for illustrating the likely GAG binding
egions.
Thank you for this suggestion, which indeed highlights better the GAG binding site. A new
panel has been added (Fig.3D), showing a surface view of CXCL13.
8. Fig 2: A panel with HSQC spectral overlay showing the HS titration should be added.
An HSQC overlaid of apo-CXCL13 and HS bound-CXCL13 (with three different HS
concentrations) has been added (now Fig. 3B).
9. Fig. S3: Correct the display of the methionine methyl group, which appears to be a
CH2 group with sp2 hybridization.
The methyl group of M49 is correct: the third hydrogen is hidden behind the carbon sphere.
Because this part of the manuscript has been moved from the result section to the discussion
as suggested in your point 10.) this figure is now Fig. S12
10. Line 316: Met49 should be mutated to test the hypothesis that it hinders GAG binding,
or this speculative analysis should be moved to the discussion.
We agree that in the absence of mutagenesis, the possibility that the Met49 hinders GAG
binding remains speculative. As requested, the corresponding paragraph has been moved to the
discussion.
11. Line 429: Analysis of CXCL13 dimerization is lacking in several respects. An HSQC
overlay at different concentrations should be shown as a supplemental figure to illustrate the
slow exchange between monomer and dimer.
An HSQC overlay of <U+2206>N-CXCL13 at 56 uM and 860 uM has been added (see new Fig. S7). As
ndicated above, this construct (rather than the full length wt-CXCL13) has been used to
dentify the dimerization interface, as the N-terminal domain is not participating in the
dimerization and it yields a simpler spectrum. As dimerization and N-terminal unfolding are
inked, the <U+2206>N-CXCL13 sample enables us to unambiguously decipher which spectral
variations are only due to dimerization.
12. Line 440: Quantitation of binding from peak heights can be challenging. How were
peak intensities measured (maximum vs integrated intensity, e.g.)? The binding isotherm used
o estimate dimer Kd should be shown in a figure.
NMR signals were measured by integrating the peak of amino acids involved in dimerization
thus peak volume and not peak heights – Line 440 has been modified accordingly). The dimer
Kd has been estimated using peak volumes using the equation 2 of the supplementary document
and each of the amino acid signals for which the monomer-dimer signal dispersion were
sufficient for proper volume measurement. The Kd values reported in the manuscript are the
mean of all individual values along with standard deviations.
13. Line 443: If monomer and dimer are present in slow exchange, how were the dimer
esonances assigned?
The dimer specific N-H resonances were assessed by recording HSQC at different
concentrations and by monitoring peak appearance (illustrated on Fig. S7). The dimer
esonances were assigned by recording NMR experiments on <U+2206>N-CXCL13 displaying both
oligomeric states (protein concentration was 580 µM). Backbone and side chains were assigned
using the same approach than for the monomer.
14. By how much is the CXCL13 dimer Kd reduced in the presence of HS?
Measuring the CXCL13 dimer affinity in the presence of HS would require knowing the
proportion of the HS bound- and HS free- CXCL13 (either in their monomer and dimer form),
a data that is not available. As we observed that <U+2206>N-CXCL13, at 50 µM, was essentially
monomeric and almost entirely shift to a dimer upon addition of an equimolar concentration of
HS, we concluded that HS induced strong dimerization without indicating a Kd value.
15. Line 470: Which double-mutant CXCL13 was used for cell binding measurements?
The double-mutant CXCL13 corresponds to CXCL13 mutated on both the C1 (a-helix) and the
C5 (C-terminus) clusters. This is now indicated, line 469.
16. Line 556: ‘Low’ (here and elsewhere) is an imprecise description of binding affinity
and should be replaced with a more quantitative term.
Thanks for having pointed out this imprecise description. We edited the manuscript, taking into
account this remark and sentence (line 560) now reads: “Surprisingly, the time scale of
dimerization is slow compared to the chemical shift time scale, which is uncommon for
millimolar-range affinity dimer (instead of low affinity dimer).
17. Line 556: Why is association of the N-terminus with the beta-1 strand not mentioned
as an equally plausible disrupter of dimerization? The role of flexible N- and C-terminal
sequences in the low propensity for dimerization should be investigated by comparing truncated
and full-length sequences by 2D NMR.
As explained above, in absence of the initiating Met, we did not detect any interaction between
he N-terminal domain and the beta-1 strand of the protein (new Fig. S1). We thus do not discuss
he possibility that the N-terminus could interfere with the dimerization. The possibility that the
extended C-terminus may prevent or decrease dimerization has only been introduced as a
possible hypothesis (in comparison with other C-terminally extended chemokine). Investigating
he possible influence of the C-terminal domain on dimerization is not really in the scope of the
study and would require recording data with CXCL13-<U+2206>C at high concentration.
18. Line 30: replace ‘an information’ with, e.g. ‘details’
19. Line 129: transversal -> transverse
20. Line 136: delete ‘a’
21. Line 138: change gamma to delta in both cases.
22. Line 162: thermolysine -> thermolysin
23. Line 257: delete ‘the’
24. Line 259: residues -> residue
25. Line 336:form -> from; off-rate -> off-rates
26. Line 361: define ‘GA’
27. Line 448: helix -> helices
28. Line 527: know -> now
29. Line 544: of -> to
30. Line 545: delete ‘the’
31. Line 571: recognizes -> recognize
32. Line 575: was -> were
Thank you for having noticed these errors and typos. They have been corrected and GA (which
stand for genetic algorithm….) – your point 26 - has been defined in the text (see line 355).

Comments to the Author(s)
nteraction of chemokines with extracellular components was shown to play a role in their
presentation and distribution in the tissue. In this work Monneau and colleagues present work
aimed at investigate how heparan sulphate (HS) can regulate CXCL13 activity. To this end
hey solved the solution structure of CXCL13 and present data concerning the mechanism of
CXL13 dimerization upon HS-chemokine interaction. Relevant for this work, the authors
showed before in an in vivo context that CXL12 interaction with HS plays a role in the function
of the chemokine.
According to the presented results, CXCL13 can be presented to its receptor in a HS-bound
orm, which is consistent with the idea that it functions in promoting cell adhesion. Indeed,
based on definition of the domains of the protein to which HS binds the authors constructed
CXCL13 mutations in which they uncouple HS binding from CXCR5 signaling, showing that
he two features of the chemokine (HS binding and signaling) are separable and that the HS
binding is not required for signalling. The results thus potentially allow the evaluation of the
ole each one of the two processes separately concerning the function of CXCL13. Another
inding highlights the importance of proper N-terminal protein sequence (the first Methionine)
n dictating the structure of the chemokine.
The paper is well written and the message is very clear. The results now allow the functional
analysis and dissection of the two different features of the protein and thus biologically
ntersting. Such future work is likely to shed light on the precise mode of action of the CXCL13
chemokine in different contexts and is also interesting with respect to chemokine evolution, as
differences among different chemokines are described.
While the presented data appears interesting and of high quality, I would rely on structural
biologists referees to judge this aspect of the work.
For Figure 7, I would add a mutation affecting the signaling, such that there is a form that serves
as negative control in the experiment. In addition, for clarity, instead of the triangles and
squares, I would use different colors for the plots and indicate what each signifies within the
panel itself.
We have now introduced a mutant form: <U+2206>N-CXCL13 (CXCL13 from which residues 1 to 9
have been deleted) and showed that, although it dimerises and binds to HS with an affinity
similar to that of the full-length protein, it lacks biological activity. This has been added on Fig.
7A (now Fig. 8), in which a colour code has been introduced as requested. These new data
urther support that bioactivity and binding to HS rely on distinct domains (thank you for this
suggestion) and have been now described (see lines 478-482).
Minor points –
The title of the paper “Solution structure of CXCL13 and heparan sulphate binding show that
GAG binding site and biological activity rely on distinct domains” means that the GAG binding
site has no biological activity, a point that was not really shown in the paper. Such a claim could
be examined by assaying the CXCL13 in the context of the whole animal.
We agree that our title may be confusing and could indeed (wrongly) suggest that eliminating
GAG binding would have no effect in vivo. We thus thank the referee for this pertinent remark
and have changed our title that now reads: “Solution structure of CXCL13 and heparan sulphate
binding show that GAG binding site and cellular signalling rely on distinct domains”
I would phrase the “Computational approaches were used to analyse the HS sequences
preferentially recognized by the protein and gain atomic level understanding of the CXCL13
nduced dimerization observed upon HS binding.” In the abstract differently, as it might be
understood that the dimerization is induced by the chemokine.
The sentence has been rephrased and now reads: “Computational approaches were used to
analyse the HS sequences preferentially recognized by the protein and gain atomic level
understanding of the CXCL13 dimerization induced by HS binding.”
“Both HS and receptor binding sites of CXCL13 are distinct “ – I would delete the word
“both”.
"Both" has been deleted.
“ Figure S10: CXCR5 expression of splenocytes and transfected CHO cells. A: The levels of
CXCR5, the CXCL13 receptoe,…” should be =Receptor
Thank you for having noticed this typo. It has been corrected.

Comments to the Author(s)
The revised manuscript is much improved after incorporation of the vast majority of reviewer
suggestions and is suitable for publication.
Referee: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed the previous concerns and the current manuscript is suitable for
publication in Open Biology with minor revisions.
1. I recommend that the authors use the IUPAC accepted spelling of "sulfate".
Done
2. Line 29 should read "a detail that remains elusive".
Done, thank you
3. The authors mention that HS is comprised of GlcA, IdoA and GlcNAc/GlcNS. Then, they
say ‘both’ can be sulfated (line 62). Please clarify which entities are sulfated.
The sentence has been modified and now read: "It is composed of alternating hexuronic acid,
either a glucuronic acid (GlcA) or its C-5 epimer, an iduronic acid (IdoA), and a N-acetyl-or
N-sulfated- glucosamine (GlcNAc or GlcNS). Resulting disaccharides can also be O-sulfated
at different positions, which may occur at C-2, C-6 and occasionally C-3 of GlcN, and C-2 of
doA or GlcA".
4. Please provide a reference for the statement on "HS-mediated chemokine immobilization"
lines 66-72).
Reference 8 and 9 (which were introduced later in the text) have been now indicated directly
after the statement on "HS-mediated chemokine immobilization"
5. Line 235 is empty after the word "cells". Please correct formatting.
Done
6. Change the word ‘extend’ (line 314) to ‘extent’.
Done, thank you
7. Please correct the grammar in the sentence "However, although CXCL13 was incubated at
high concentration (3 µM) in the cross-linking approach, a method that was shown to identify
ow affinity binding sites [18]" (lines 314-316).
Done, thank you
8. The authors use different designations: ‘40s’ (line 316) and ‘40’s’ (line 521). Please use the
same nomenclature throughout the paper.
Done, thank you
9. Please highlight the 40s loop in the sequence of one of the figures to improve clarity.
The 40s loop has been highlighted as recommended (see figure 3E) and the corresponding
egend modified accordingly.
10. The authors chose to mutate basic residues that show the highest CSPs. Please comment on
why other residues (non-basic) that exhibit high CSPs were not probed by mutagenesis?
Non-basic residues indeed also experienced CSPs, such as Leu65 and Leu66 for example. These
esidues, which are pointing toward the protein core, cannot interact with the ligand, and
presumably underwent conformational reorganization rather than direct binding. On this basis,
and because the mutagenesis of the basic residues of clusters 1 and 5 was sufficient to fully
disrupt HS binding, these non-basic residues were not further investigated using mutagenesis.
The following sentence has been added to the text (see line 309- 312): "Finally, non-basic
esidues also experienced CSPs, such as Leu65 and Leu66 for example (Figure 3E). These
esidues, which are pointing toward the protein core, presumably underwent conformational
eorganization rather than direct binding with the ligand".
11. Please comment on the physiological relevance of dimerization, given the low affinity?
Given the low affinity for dimerization, HS free-CXCL13 is likely to function as a monomer,
at least as shown with the cell assay used in the present study. As we reported, dimerization is
nevertheless strongly induced upon binding to HS. Such dimer, which leaves the N-terminus
and N-loop exposed on the chemokine surface, can activate the receptor and thus may represent
a functional unit which local concentration would be increased by HS binding. The
physiological relevance of this possibility remains to be investigated. To comment on this
aspect we added few lines in the discussion section (lines 574-577).
12. Please correct the grammar in the statement ‘which structure are still unknown’ (line 578).
Done, thank you
13. In the legend for Figure 4, the authors fail to explain what the grey line is. Also, the grey
race is absent in panel A of Figure 4.
The grey trace in figure 4A has been added and the legend modified (thanks for having noticed
his omission).
