In this manuscript, the authors describe the crystal structures of the apo-, PLP- and PMP-bound
forms of Spr1654 and identify the key Spr1654 residues for ligand binding and catalysis. A detail
model for teichoic acid synthesis in S. pneumoniae has been proposed 2012 (Denapaite et al.,
2012) and it was suggested that Spr1654 is involved in the early steps of TA precursor synthesis,
where the first amino sugar UDP-AATGal was predicted to be synthesized by this
aminotransferase. In this manuscript the authors demonstrate the aminotransferase activity of
Spr1654 using structural and biochemical analyses. This is a very important finding and should
be communicated to the public health community. The manuscript is well written and the
scientific content is clearly structured. From my point of view, only a few minor details need
attention.
The authors should propose the name for Spr1654 and use this name in the manuscript; because
spr1654 is not hypothetical gene any more.
S. pneumoniae wrong spelled in many places. Please check spelling.
I have found some troubles with the references used in introduction. For example:
Line 43. It would be better to quote Neuhaus, F.C., and J. Baddiley. 2003.
Line 60-63. To the best of my knowledge, Massidda et al (2013) are not describing biosynthesis of
teichoic acids in this review and focusing only on cell division proteins. Please, comment.
Denapaite et al. (2012) are describing only 18 known and hypothetical genes which products are
required for synthesis of the TA repeating unit as well as for their polymerization, transport and
anchoring in either cell wall or the PG. How the authors come to 22?
Line 174-177. The authors are describing three best hits found in Dali server. Why the authors did
not use the third hit of “GDP176 Perosamine Synthase” for blast sequence alignment. Please
explain.

This manuscript reports the crystal structure of Spr1654 from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Based
on sequence similarity analyses, the protein had previously been proposed to catalyze the
pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent transamination of UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-GlcNAc to yield 2-
acetamido-4-amino-2, 4, 6-trideoxygalactose (AATGal), a precursor for the synthesis of wall and
lipoteichoic acids in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The crystallographic work, which included the
structures of apo, PLP-bound and PMP-bound Spr1654, appears solid, although the final R-
factors suggest that the models would benefit from additional refinement. As expected from
sequence similarity, the structures confirm that the enzyme belongs to the Type-I
aminotransferase family of PLP-dependent enzymes, similar to other sugar-nucleotide
transaminases including GDP-Perosamine Synthase, UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-AltNAc
Synthetase (PseC), and UDP-4-amino-4deoxy-arabinose synthetase (ArnB). The half reaction with
glutamate suggests the enzyme is indeed a transaminase. However, the authors stop short of
testing the activity of Spr1654 in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, its role in AATGal and teichoic acid
(TA) biosynthesis remains to be tested. In this context, the authors assertion that they “…
performed preliminary structural and functional studies on Spr1654, demonstrating the
aminotransferase role in TA synthetic pathway…” appears premature. Despite this caveat the
authors offer a model of the complex between the enzyme and its putative product. The
manuscript would benefit from a description or a figure of the superpositions that give raise to
the model.
In the words of the authors the value of the manuscript rests on the essentiality of Spr1654 in
Streptococcus pneumoniae: “…following genetic disruption of Spr1654 in streptococcal cells, no
colonies are formed on selective agar plates, demonstrating that Spr1654 is an essential gene for S.
pneumoniae survival [19, 20]. This renders in our opinion Spr1654 an excellent target for the
development of selective inhibitors that could abolish bacterial virulence by interfering with the
biosynthesis of the cell wall…”

As far as I could tell, Reference 19 [Thanassi, J.A., 2002 Identification of 113 conserved essential
genes using a high-throughput gene disruption system in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nucleic
Acids Res. 30(14): p. 3152-62.] makes no mention of Spr1654 and it is not listed in the table of
essential genes. It is possible that a nomenclature difference is behind this apparent inconsistency.
If so, it needs to be clarified. Furthermore, Reference 20 [Thanassi, D.G. 2002 Ushers and secretins:
channels for the secretion of folded proteins across the bacterial outer membrane. J Mol Microbiol
Biotechnol. 4(1): p. 11-20 ] appears to be unrelated to Spr1654 or the topic of this manuscript.
Several other assertions in the manuscript do not appear well supported by the references. For
example:
“… Indeed, Spr1654 was suggested to catalyze the PLP-dependent addition of the amino group to
the C-4 atom of the UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-GlcNAc in order to form UDP-AATGal [12, 18]…” but
I could not identify mentions of Spr1654 in references 12 or 18.
“… It has been previously suggested that the intermediates UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-GlcNAc
produced by Spr0092 (Figure 1b) is an unstable compound and that Spr1654 may form a
multiprotein complex with Spr0092 for the efficient transport of the intermediates between the
active sites [35, 36]…” Reference 35 discusses instability of other 4-keto-6-deoxy sugars but makes
no mention of Spr1654, its substrate or complexes with other proteins. Similarly, Reference 36
does not offer data to support the assertion.
Organization: the first subheading of the manuscript “Spr1654 is a PLP-dependent
aminotransferase” describe similarity to other PLP-dependent transaminases and conservation of
two active site residues as strong evidence that the protein is a PLP-dependent aminotransferase.
This could be confusing to some readers. Belonging to the Type I aminotransferase family does
not provide “strong evidence” for an amino transfer reaction. Members of the Type-I
“aminotransferase” family include tryptophan indole-lyase and ornithine decarboxylase to name
just two other PLP-dependent enzymes that catalyze different reactions. The case for amino
transfer is supported later in the manuscript with the glutamate half reaction experiments. The
authors should consider reorganizing the results to clarify this point.
The authors indicate that “… For most SATs, the amino donor is either L-glutamate or L-
glutamine [25], but L-aspartate may also be used in some few cases [29]…” It is thus not obvious
why they chose not to test glutamine as an amino donor.
In summary, the manuscript presents solid crystallographic data on an enzyme proposed to play
an important role in the synthesis of teichoic acids in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The manuscript
would be greatly enhanced by activity data to experimentally validate the proposed role for the
enzyme. While the substrate may not be commercially available, it seems that it could easily be
made in situ from UDP-GlcNac and Spr0092. Enzymatic synthesis of substrates was used to
characterize the reactions catalyzed by the related enzymes GDP-Perosamine Synthase, UDP-4-
amino-4,6-dideoxy-AltNAc Synthase (PseC), and UDP-4-amino-4deoxy-arabinose synthase
(ArnB). In its current form, the manuscript provides structures of an uncharacterized enzyme and
its presentation requires careful reevaluation of the conclusions, and the data and references to
support them.

is involved in the early steps of TA precursor synthesis, where the first amino sugar
UDP-AATGal was predicted to be synthesized by this aminotransferase. In this
manuscript the authors demonstrate the aminotransferase activity of Spr1654 using
structural and biochemical analyses. This is a very important finding and should be
communicated to the public health community. The manuscript is well written and
the scientific content is clearly structured. From my point of view, only a few minor
details need attention.
The authors should propose the name for Spr1654 and use this name in the
manuscript; because spr1654 is not hypothetical gene any more.
In this study, we have demonstrated the aminotransferase activity of Spr1654.
However, considering that we were unable to identify the real substrate of Spr1654, in
order to test the entire transaminase reaction in the TA synthetic pathway, this hinders
us at the present time from modifying Spr1654 to an adequate denomination.
S. pneumoniae wrong spelled in many places. Please check spelling.
We apologize for these mistakes which have been corrected.
I have found some troubles with the references used in introduction. For example:
Line 43. It would be better to quote Neuhaus, F.C., and J. Baddiley. 2003.
We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and this reference has been added
to the revised version of the manuscript. Line 42, reference 3.
Line 60-63. To the best of my knowledge, Massidda et al (2013) are not describing
biosynthesis of teichoic acids in this review and focusing only on cell division
proteins. Please, comment.
The publication by Massidda et al was cited since it describes how LCP proteins can
transfer TA subunits to the peptidoglycan in the assembly of wall teichoic acid and
capsular polysaccharides. However, following the suggestion of the reviewer, we
have now replaced this citation by two publications by Brown et al, 2013 (reference
14) and Rahman et al, 2009 (reference 15) in the revised manuscript (lines 60-62).
Denapaite et al. (2012) are describing only 18 known and hypothetical genes which
products are required for synthesis of the TA repeating unit as well as for their
polymerization, transport and anchoring in either cell wall or the PG. How the
authors come to 22?
We would like to thank very much the reviewer for hindering us from stating this
erroneous statement. The reasons underlying this wrong statement is that we decided
to study a selection of proteins within the frame of TA synthesis and based on the
publication of Denapaite et al as well as some other publications, our research group
identified 22 potential interesting targets.
However, besides the 18 proteins mentioned in the Denapaite publication, the recent
study of Xue Liu et al (2017), now reference 2 in our revised manuscript, revealed
that spd1197 tarQ (equivalent to spr1221) participates in the polymerization of TA
chains together with the polymerase spd1198 TarP (equivalent to spr1222). Thus, we
decided to include Spr1221 to the 18 proteins suggested by the Denapaite study (lines
58-60).
Line 174-177. The authors are describing three best hits found in Dali server. Why
the authors did not use the third hit of “GDP176 Perosamine Synthase” for blast
sequence alignment. Please explain.
We agree with the reviewer and have added the GDP-Perosamine Synthase to the
blast sequence alignment in a revised version of this figure. The text of the manuscript
has also been changed accordingly (lines 105-110) and revised Figure 2.
Referee 2
This manuscript reports the crystal structure of Spr1654 from Streptococcus
pneumoniae. Based on sequence similarity analyses, the protein had previously
been proposed to catalyze the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent transamination of
UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-GlcNAc to yield 2-acetamido-4-amino-2, 4, 6-
trideoxygalactose (AATGal), a precursor for the synthesis of wall and lipoteichoic
acids in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The crystallographic work, which included the
structures of apo, PLP-bound and PMP-bound Spr1654, appears solid, although
the final R-factors suggest that the models would benefit from additional
refinement.
Although we agree that the obtained R/Rfree values are not ‘optimal’ for 1.8-2.3Å
resolution structures, they are in our opinion fully acceptable. It should be noted that
we have performed extensive refinement assays, using several different strategies.
However, none of the refinement strategy reduced the R-factors further without
deterioration of the models. In our opinion, the most important is not the exact value
obtained for R/Rfree, but rather the quality of the electron density maps which are
good enough for us to position all the residues of Spr1654 without any doubt. Where
in doubt, we introduced gaps in the three-dimensional structures.
As expected from sequence similarity, the structures confirm that the enzyme
belongs to the Type-I aminotransferase family of PLP-dependent enzymes, similar
to other sugar-nucleotide transaminases including GDP-Perosamine Synthase,
UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-AltNAc Synthetase (PseC), and UDP-4-amino-4deoxy-
arabinose synthetase (ArnB). The half reaction with glutamate suggests the enzyme
is indeed a transaminase. However, the authors stop short of testing the activity of
Spr1654 in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, its role in AATGal and teichoic acid (TA)
biosynthesis remains to be tested. In this context, the authors assertion that they “…
performed preliminary structural and functional studies on Spr1654, demonstrating
the aminotransferase role in TA synthetic pathway…” appears premature.
We agree with the reviewer that our conclusion cannot be entirely supported without
conducting the enzymatic reaction using the biological substrate of Spr1654 in the TA
synthetic pathway in order to create UDP-AATGal. However, we believe that our
study already provides strong support for the proposed function of Spr1654 in TA
synthesis. We also agree with the reviewer that the biological substrate needs to be
further investigated. Unfortunately, we were unable to produce this substrate
synthetically nor through the use of the molecule Spr0092 (please see our response
here below to another comment from the reviewer).
The contents of the manuscript were modified following the comments from the
suggestions of the reviewer, and in particular the statement within the last section of
our manuscript (lines 377-390).
Despite this caveat the authors offer a model of the complex between the enzyme
and its putative product. The manuscript would benefit from a description or a
figure of the superpositions that give raise to the model.
Our model is based on the superposition of the structure of Spr1654/PLP on the
previously determined crystal structures of PseC/PMP/UDP-L-AltNAc (PDB code
2FNU) and ArnB/PLP/UDP-Ara4N (PDB code 4OCA). This molecular model was
created in two steps, the first indicating that the sugar substrate UDP-L-AltNAc with
an N-acetyl group fits better within the active site of Spr1654/PLP compared to UDP-
Ara4N. The second step allowed us to model the proposed substrate UDP-AATGal
within the crystal structure of Spr1654/PLP. A figure presenting this structural
superposition has now been added to the revised version of our manuscript (new
Figure 6a). The related text lines 267-271 and 320-324 were also revised accordingly.
In the words of the authors the value of the manuscript rests on the essentiality of
Spr1654 in Streptococcus pneumoniae: “…following genetic disruption of Spr1654
in streptococcal cells, no colonies are formed on selective agar plates,
demonstrating that Spr1654 is an essential gene for S. pneumoniae survival [19, 20].
This renders in our opinion Spr1654 an excellent target for the development of
selective inhibitors that could abolish bacterial virulence by interfering with the
biosynthesis of the cell wall…”
As far as I could tell, Reference 19 [Thanassi, J.A., 2002 Identification of 113
conserved essential genes using a high-throughput gene disruption system in
Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nucleic Acids Res. 30(14): p. 3152-62.] makes no
mention of Spr1654 and it is not listed in the table of essential genes. It is possible
that a nomenclature difference is behind this apparent inconsistency. If so, it needs
to be clarified.
We appreciate this comment and have revised accordingly the contents of our
manuscript in order to clarify this inconsistency (Lines 85-88). In this new version,
we state instead: “Indeed, following genetic disruption of Spr1654 (equivalent to
SP1837 in S. pneumoniae TIGR4) in streptococcal cells, no colonies are formed on
selective agar plates, demonstrating that Spr1654 is an essential gene for S.
pneumoniae survival [19].” Reference 19 corresponds to Thanassi, JA. et al, 2002.
Table 2 in Thanassi, JA et al shows that SP1837 (in S. pneumoniae TIGR4) is
equivalent to Spr1654 in S. pneumoniae R6.
Furthermore, Reference 20 [Thanassi, D.G. 2002 Ushers and secretins: channels
for the secretion of folded proteins across the bacterial outer membrane. J Mol
Microbiol Biotechnol. 4(1): p. 11-20] appears to be unrelated to Spr1654 or the
topic of this manuscript.
We agree with the reviewer and apologize for this mistake. The section in which we
are erroneously making use of this reference (Thanassi DG et al, 2002) has now been
deleted and we keep the reference 19 (Thanassi JA et al, 2002) in the revised
manuscript (Line 88). Please note that the works by Thanassi JA and Thanassi DG are
different.
Several other assertions in the manuscript do not appear well supported by the
references. For example:
“… Indeed, Spr1654 was suggested to catalyze the PLP-dependent addition of the
amino group to the C-4 atom of the UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-GlcNAc in order to
form UDP-AATGal [12, 18]…” but I could not identify mentions of Spr1654 in
references 12 or 18.
We thank the reviewer for this comment and apologize for these recurring unfortunate
errors. Of course, the references should be Seo, HS et al, 2008 (11 in our list of
references) and Aanensen, DM et al, 2007 (18 in our list of references). These errors
have been modified in the revised manuscript (Lines 80-82).
“… It has been previously suggested that the intermediates UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-
D-GlcNAc produced by Spr0092 (Figure 1b) is an unstable compound and that
Spr1654 may form a multiprotein complex with Spr0092 for the efficient transport
of the intermediates between the active sites [35, 36]…” Reference 35 discusses
instability of other 4-keto-6-deoxy sugars but makes no mention of Spr1654, its
substrate or complexes with other proteins. Similarly, Reference 36 does not offer
data to support the assertion.
We agree with the reviewer and apologize again. To our knowledge, there are no
published reports for the instability of compounds for Spr1654. Indeed, as indicated
by the reviewer, the work by Piacente, F et al, 2015 (reference 35) only suggests that
the NDP-4-keto-6-deoxyhexose intermediate produced by the dehydratase is unstable.
There are no mentions of Spr0092 nor Spr1654 in that work. However, we decided to
keep this reference since it alludes to the instability of a substrate similar to the one
for Spr1654. Additionally, we have now added new reference by Tonetti, M et al,
1998 (reference 36 in our revised list of references) which also mentions the
instability of the 4-keto-6-deoxy intermediates produced by dehydratases. The
uncorrelated reference 36 has now been deleted in the revised version of our
manuscript (Lines 364-365).
Organization: the first subheading of the manuscript “Spr1654 is a PLP-dependent
aminotransferase” describe similarity to other PLP-dependent transaminases and
conservation of two active site residues as strong evidence that the protein is a PLP-
dependent aminotransferase. This could be confusing to some readers. Belonging
to the Type I aminotransferase family does not provide “strong evidence” for an
amino transfer reaction. Members of the Type-I “aminotransferase” family include
tryptophan indole-lyase and ornithine decarboxylase to name just two other PLP-
dependent enzymes that catalyze different reactions. The case for amino transfer is
supported later in the manuscript with the glutamate half reaction experiments. The
authors should consider reorganizing the results to clarify this point.
We agree with the reviewer in her/his quest for precision, and therefore modified the
first subheading to “PLP binding and sequence analysis of Spr1654” in order to avoid
any confusion (Lines 101-127).
The authors indicate that “… For most SATs, the amino donor is either L-
glutamate or L-glutamine [25], but L-aspartate may also be used in some few cases
[29]…” It is thus not obvious why they chose not to test glutamine as an amino
donor.
Following the excellent suggestion of the reviewer, we performed additional assays
with both L-glutamate and L-glutamine. While spectra changes could be detected
immediately following the addition of L-glutamate, the reaction took place much
more slowly following addition of L-glutamine, reaching the same levels compared to
L-glutamate only after one hour. Thus, Spr1654 has a very strong preference for L-
glutamate. These results are now presented in the revised Figure 5 and lines 242-250.
In summary, the manuscript presents solid crystallographic data on an enzyme
proposed to play an important role in the synthesis of teichoic acids in
Streptococcus pneumoniae. The manuscript would be greatly enhanced by activity
data to experimentally validate the proposed role for the enzyme. While the
substrate may not be commercially available, it seems that it could easily be made in
situ from UDP-GlcNac and Spr0092. Enzymatic synthesis of substrates was used to
characterize the reactions catalyzed by the related enzymes GDP-Perosamine
Synthase, UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-AltNAc Synthase (PseC), and UDP-4-amino-
4deoxy-arabinose synthase (ArnB). In its current form, the manuscript provides
structures of an uncharacterized enzyme and its presentation requires careful
reevaluation of the conclusions, and the data and references to support them.
The criticisms from the reviewer are well-taken. Indeed, our initial strategy since this
study was initiated four years ago, was to produce soluble Spr0092 in order to obtain
the substrate for Spr1654. While we were able to produce efficiently the soluble
Spr1654, we were unfortunately unable to produce full-length Spr0092. Spr0092 is a
membrane protein with four potential transmembrane regions at its N-terminus part,
and in our hands, difficult to work with. We thereafter attempted to clone and produce
the dehydratase domain of Spr0092. Three different truncated versions of Spr0092 all
containing the dehydratase domain, corresponding to the stretch of amino acid
residues 284-616, 256-616 and 146-616, were designed based on sequence alignment
to the Helicobacter pylori-associated 4,6-dehydratase FlaA1 (Creuzenet et al, 2000
and Ishiyama et al., 2006) and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-associated UDP-GlcNAc
C6 dehydratase WbpM (Creuzenet et al, 2001). We were able to produce the
truncated versions of Spr0092 corresponding to 284-616 and 256-616, but not 146-
616, which remained insoluble (please see figure below for 284-616).
Unfortunately, we could not detect any production of NAD(P)H using
spectrophotometry, and no sign of possible products through Thin Layer
Chromatography (TLC) nor Mass Spectrometry (MS). Thus, these truncated soluble
versions of Spr0092 did not have any catalytic activity. We believe at the present
stage that the catalytic activity of Spr0092 may require the membrane domains
corresponding to residues 1-136 and/or the stretch of residues 137-256. In conclusion,
despite all these efforts, we were not able to establish an Spr0092 system that would
allow us to produce the substrate for Spr1654. One additional non-excluding
possibility is that the sugar substrate proposed to be catalyzed by Spr0092 is actually
not the appropriate biological substrate (Denapaite et al, 2012 and Aanensen, DM et
al, 2007).
In our opinion, our study still provides novel information about the essential and
uncharacterized Spr1654 that has been proposed to be involved in the TA synthetic
pathway. Of course, we also agree with the reviewer on that the specific function of
Spr1654 in the TA synthetic pathway still needs to be further investigated.

Comments to the Author(s)
The revised manuscript by Han et al. describes the structure and function of a PLP-
dependent aminotransferase that plays a role in the teichoic acid biosynthetic
pathway. The results are reliable, and the conclusion is sound and precautious
against overclaiming. I have only some minor comments:
Reference 12 (Draining et al., 2006) contains no mass spectrometry. It presents
NMR data. Please rephrase the sentence of Lines 67-68.
We agree with the reviewer and apologize for this mistake. Following the suggestion
of the reviewer, we have now removed this citation and kept reference 11 (Seo et al.,
2008) which analyzed the repeating units of the pneumococcal LTA by mass
spectrometry (Lines 67-68).
Line 259: The phrase "crystal structure of Spr1654/PLP in complex with L-
glutamate" implies that L-glutamate binds to the protein in the crystal. But this was
not the case. It would be better to say "in the presence of L-glutamate".
We would like to thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and have revised the
contents of our manuscript accordingly (Line 259).
Line 381: Both references 5 and 11 propose formation of the first amino sugar by
an aminotransferase. The word "believed" weakens experimental support for such
a notion.
We appreciate this comment and the text of the manuscript has been changed
accordingly (Line 381).
Figure 6: The authors show interest in the "unusual non-proline cis-bond" (Line
333). It would be helpful to show this backbone bond in (d).
We agree with the reviewer and we have showed the main chains of the
corresponding amino acids H344 and Y345 in the revised version of figure 6 (b and d).
