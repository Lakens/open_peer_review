Grant et al. investigate a novel role for Aurora-A kinase in the maintenance of mitochondrial
morphology in interphase. For obvious reasons, the focus of research on AurA has so far been on
its mitotic role and I think there will be wide interest in this work since it suggests that AurA has
other functions. If this is correct it has implications for cancer since AurA is frequently over
expressed in cancer cells and for its treatment since AurA inhibition as a cancer treatment is
currently being trialed in the clinic.
I was happy to review this paper since I'd already read it on bioRxiv. Thanks to the authors for
making it available ahead of publication. I found this paper to be very well written, the
experimental data are of a high standard and the discussion of results is honest. My criticisms:
1. Results p.7: "Conversely, we found that tetracycline-induced overexpression of an AURKA-
Venus transgene in RPE-1 cells resulted in increased fragmentation of the mitochondrial network
(Figure 2D,E)." Looking at the figure it looks like there is no change. What do the stats say (see
next point)? I see two reasons why the authors detect no fragmentation of mitochondria in RPE-1
with induced AurA OE: a) they just don't go any shorter in RPE-1 cells, b) in this series of
experiments the cells were behaving differently (note that the distribution is shifted to longer
mitochondria lengths when compared with other experiments in this figure. Looking at Fig S3 it
seems like OE of AurA does fragment the mitochondria. It would be nice to show that the change
can be induced the other way by OE, so it would be worth repeating this experiment to clarify
this result
2. Some clarity over the stats and presentation would be good. The authors show the results of
manual measurements (30 mitos/cell, 20 cells from 3 expts) as smoothed PDFs (using a kernel
density estimation method). This is OK but makes me wonder why smoothing is applied at all.
Second point is that a Mann-Whitney test is done and low p values are reported. As I understand
it these tests are done on the outputs from MicroP and not the manual measurements. My guess
is that the authors did not use the actual N value of 3 to calculate the p value from the MW test.
The effects here are clear (even if not what the authors want, see point above) but the stats need
to be valid and done properly. My suggestion here is that the authors should show the (raw)
measurements as cumulative histograms and compare each pair of distributions using a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
3. The experiments in Fig 3 are really important to show a role for AurA at the mitochondria. It is
3
pretty convincing. However, there's a lot of AurA signal which is clearly not on the mitochondria.
My worry is that the dots that are coincident with the mitochondrial network are not specifically
targeted there. In a live cell movie, do the authors see the spots wobbling around stuck to the
mitotracker-stained mitochondria? This would be good evidence that AurA is specifically
targeted to mitochondria and might also reveal if it is indeed preferentially found at network
branch points.
4. The authors say "cloning details are available on request". Really? Cloning details? This is
important for anyone wanting to reproduce the work. Just add them to the paper and be done
with it.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_3
This manuscript by Grant et al investigates the relationship between AURKA and the dynamics
of mitochondrial network. The authors demonstrated that a fraction of cytoplasmic AURKA
localizes to mitochondria and interacts with mitochondrial protein TOMM20, and they also
identified a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) in N-terminal domain of AURKA.
A better understanding of the control of AURKA activity beyond mitosis and the role of AURKA
in interphase cells are important in optimizing the efficacy and interpreting potential
downstream consequences of AURKA inhibitors in the clinic.
Current manuscript is a revised version after the first round of the review process. In my opinion
the authors have addressed the questions raised by the reviewers.

Minor comments:
1) please check the reference to Figure 4C on page 4, it seems there is a mistake in this reference
and Figure 4 can’t be reference prior to Figure 3. “In further experiments we found that transient
overexpression of AURKA-Venus in RPE-1 cells or in another
untransformed line, breast epithelial MCF10A cells, also led to increased fragmentation of
themitochondrial network in cells overexpressing AURKA (Figure 4C, Supplementary Figure
S2C).”
2) Please check the reference to Figure 3C on page 6, it seems to be a mistake and Figure 4C
should be referenced instead. - "Moreover, AURKA<U+0394>31 overexpression did not cause

Appendix A
Response to Referees.
Referee 1
We agree with the referee that this result – increased fragmentation of mitochondrial network upon
induction of a stable AURKA-Venus transgene in RPE cells - did not look a strong result, however it is
statistically significant (see point 2). We agree with the suggestion that RPE mitochondria are rather
resistant to shortening. Higher level of overexpression of AURKA after transient transfection has a
much clearer effect in shortening mitochondria (data now in Fig 3E and Fig S4A&B, with
quantifications) and we have also tested the result in another untransformed cell line, MCF10A (Fig
S2C), in response to Referee 2.
We acknowledge the commentary on suitable presentation and statistical tests for mitochondrial size
data and thank Referee 1 for his suggestion of the K-S test, which we had not previously used. We
have now reanalysed our data using the K-S test, with D- and p-values logged in all figure legends.
The K-S test showed increased confidence in most of our results (compared to the MW test applied
previously) EXCEPT for the result in Fig2E (previously Fig 2C), which Referee 1 had spotted as less
convincing. However the p-value for this distribution still crosses the threshold for significance (see
point 1).
We chose kernel density plots to present our data because they are easier to look at than histograms
of the same data, especially where comparing two conditions. We have added two new panels to
Figure S2 to support our chosen methods: Fig S2A shows that the kernel density plot for the data in
Fig 1A maps exactly onto a histogram plot of the same data. Fig S2B shows the cumulative density
plots of the same data, to which the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is applied for statistical
significance.
We agree that the large number of dots seen in AURKA IF are a worry in terms of establishing specific
localization with mitochondria, and we spent a lot of time convincing ourselves of this result.
Unfortunately it is not possible to assess colocalization through time as Referee 1 suggests, since our
timelapse movies do not offer sufficient temporal resolution. However, we have included in FigS3
images that we obtained on an OMX, that show examples of AURKA-Venus dots localized to
mitochondria at increased resolution. We also checked the statistical performance of random patterns
of dots against our AURKA dots to confirm significant co-localization (see also response to Referee 2
point 3) – data not included in manuscript, but we would be happy to send for inspection to Referees.
We have added subcloning details in Materials & Methods.
Referee 2
We have included more information to validate use of PCNA as a marker for cell cycle phases. We
have added a citation of the method [Zerjatke, T. et al. Quantitative Cell Cycle Analysis Based on an
Endogenous All-in-One Reporter for Cell Tracking and Classification. Cell Rep 19, 1953–1966 (2017)]
and have added to Fig 1B the cell cycle distribution stats which show that our scoring with PCNA gives
the expected G1:S:G2 phases in the population. We chose this method in order to avoid
synchronisation protocols (suggested by Referee 2), since all methods we know of involve use of
reagents eliciting cellular stress. We agree that Fig 1C was not clear and have reassembled it from
raw image files to improve the quality of the figure panel as requested.
Indeed we agree with these comments from Referee 2. We have written up our findings as a ‘short
report’ precisely because we felt the claims we could associate to this work are rather modest, and we
carefully avoid making the ‘global’ claim about differential expression of AURKA and mitochondrial
morphologies in cancers. The amount of work involved in a systematic study (to support a global
claim) would warrant a much bigger publication. However, in response to this Referee’s concerns we
have repeated our core finding – that raising AURKA levels leads to shortening of mitochondria and
inhibition of AURKA activity has the opposite effect – in another pair of cell lines showing opposite
mitochondrial morphology (non-transformed MCF10A and HCC1143 breast cancer cells). These
additional data are in Fig S2C,D.
We are pursuing the ‘global’ question as a two year collaboration with other labs. This future work will
include figuring out an assay sensitive enough to answer Referee 2’s question about activity: Given it
is the activity of AURKA at the mitochondria that is responsible for the effect on morphology, we would
indeed want to detect activity of this subpopulation of the kinase. Existing tools are not sensitive
enough, and we plan to use new FRET-based tools in development.
We have looked carefully at Fig S3A (previously Fig S1C), and although we understand the Referee’s
concern that there could be mutually exclusive staining of the AURKA ‘dots’ (in green) with the
mitochondrial staining (purple), we are confident that our interpretation is safe. We have added arrows
to indicate colocalization. Notably, in the knockdown image, where cytoplasmic staining is much
reduced, the remaining signal appears more likely to colocalise to mitochondria, which we think argues
against the interpretation of ‘mutually exclusive staining’ in the control image. We have modified the
figure legend to clarify our interpretation.
In a study to compare the colocalization of mitochondria with AURKA ‘dots’, versus random fields of
‘dots’ generated with 100nm fluoresent beads, we found highly significant differences in Pearson’s
Correlation Coefficients, in favour of the idea that the AURKA staining pattern contains a component
specific to mitochondria.
Finally, we generated higher resolution images on an OMX system that appear to confirm
colocalization of AURKA dots with mitochondria, and have included this data in Fig 3.
Figure S3F (previously S3D) demonstrates the successful endogenous tagging of AURKA (ie it
behaves as predicted through the cell cycle). We have reduced the number of images in this panel
and explained in more detail in the figure legend.
To address Referee 2 comments on Fig3: Aurora A overexpression in our hands rarely leads to mitotic
abnormalities, and certainly never to arrest in cytokinesis. If anything, it promotes cytokinesis (as might
be expected from the recent work of Vernos and Prigent labs showing AURKA-dependent
phosphorylation of p150 is required for anaphase). We have removed the previous Fig 3C
quantification of AURKA-Venus overexpression, which was not an important result, to make way for
new data in this figure (now Fig 3D). The previous Fig 3D showed fixed cells from the endogenously
tagged AURKA-Venus line shown in Fig S3. We can’t explain the bright dots, but they are not
centrosomal abnormalities. We had chosen this image because it showed a particularly nice example
of colocalization of the endogenous-tagged AURKA with mitochondrial staining. We have chosen a
different image (now Fig 3C) that we hope is more acceptable.
Thanks to Referee 2 for pointing out the error in this panel. We had intended to remove lanes 4 and 8,
which show cells transfected with a mutated version of AURKA (a non-degradable version that we
were testing for altered localization to the mitochondria). In the interests of telling a simple story we
had decided not to add this negative result to the story. We have now removed these lanes in the
revised version of Figure 3.
We based our study on experiments carried out in two different cell lines. This was a necessary
choice: For experiments to examine the consequences of reducing AURKA levels, we looked at U2OS
cells, where AURKA levels are higher than RPE. For experiments to analyse the effect of different
versions on AURKA on mitochondrial morphology, we chose RPE cells, since the mitochondria are
already rather fragmented in U2OS cells. In the same experiments we analysed the mitochondrial
morphology and examined the localization. The result of this choice does mean therefore that the
colocalization data are mostly from RPE cells. To address this criticism we have carried out a new
experiment to show enhanced colocalization of AURKA-<U+0394>8-Venus with mitochondria in U2OS cells
(Fig S4D).
We have re-done all of our statistical analyses in line with the suggestions of Referee 1, and have
added them to all figure legends.
We have modified the title of our study as recommended.
Appendix B
Response to Referees.
The referee points out a couple of errors with figure citations in the main text of our revised
manuscript. We are uploading a final version of the manuscript in which these errors have been
corrected as follows:
1) The reference to Figure 4C has been removed from p4
2) The reference to Figure 3C on p6 has been altered to read Figure 4C.
We are delighted that our manuscript is ready for publication, and thank the referee for his time and
effort.
