Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In this commentary, the authors provide an overview of protein-based materials appropriate for a
general audience. There are some aspects that could improve the manuscript.
1. In figure 1, it appears that the conserved repeat composition for most proteins is the amino acid
sequence that confers the structural or mechanical properties. However, for keratin, the cell-
adhesion sequences (that are found in many other proteins as well) are listed. It would be better
to be consistent and list the conserved amino acid sequence for keratin that contributes to
structure (presumably the alpha-helical sequences?).
2. The text states that the “most commonly used repeat sequence for recombinant resilin” is from
A. gambiae, but the Drosophila sequence is also widely used. It is not clear to this reviewer that
one is used more than the other.
3. Some of the references do not appear to be correct. For example, references 27 and 28 are used
to support the sentence that materials “have been used to encourage tissue growth during
subcutaneous implantation, for example in promoting bone healing.” Neither the Moisenovich
reference (27) nor the Aldo reference (28) examine bone healing, and the Aldo reference does not
include subcutaneous implantation studies. Another example is reference 36, which is used to
support the sentence that “collagen has been used for tissue grafts and made into a porous gel
that promotes wound healing.” The Milthorpe reference (36) appears to examine tendon and
ligament repair and does not examine wound healing.
4. Several of the words defined in the Definitions list do not appear to be used in the
commentary. Specifically, elastic modulus, electrospinning, self-healing, strain healing, and yield
strength were not found in the main text.

Decision letter (RSOB-18-0113.R0)
10-Sep-2018
Dear Dr Abascal
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0113 entitled "The past, present, and
future of protein-based materials" has been accepted by the Editor for publication in Open
Biology. The reviewer has recommended publication, but also suggest some minor revisions to
your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer's comments and revise
your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
4
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
The Open Biology Team

Appendix A
To the Open Biology Team,
Thank you so much for your careful reading and review. All of the
referee's comments have been addressed, and it is our hope that our
commentary will be suitable for submission now.
Each comment will be addressed by its corresponding number (as was
rendered in the "Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author" section of the
Decision Letter).
1. Figure one was fixed such that the repeating portions of both alpha
and beta Keratin are addressed (alpha has repeating alpha-helical
regions while beta has repeating beta-sheet regions).
2. The text now reads: "However, the exact sequence of the resilin
varies from source to source (i.e. mosquito resilin varies from fruit fly
resilin), although one of the most commonly used repeat sequence for
recombinant resilin being that from A. gambiae, AQTPSSQYGAP."
3. Each of the noted citations were more accurately referenced in the
text.
4. The preamble before our Definitions list now says: "Many of the
terms associated with biomaterials are quite loosely defined, with
broad interpretations, while others are more precisely defined. It is
therefore important to specify the meaning of a few commonly used
terms in the field. Some of these terms appear in this commentary."
Thank you again for your review and acceptance.
