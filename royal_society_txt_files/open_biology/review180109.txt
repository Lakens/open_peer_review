This is a nice review focusing on the major SAC kinase Mps1 and how it is regulated. It is well
written and I only have minor suggestions to consider:
1) At the end of section 7 could they comment on the functional relevance on the model they
propose for regulating Mps1 interactions with KTs.
2) Maybe briefly in the text mention RVxF motif in KNL1 and its regulation by Aurora B in
relation to dephosphorylation of MELT repeats.
3) I guess it cannot be excluded that Mps1 has additional functional interactions with
kinetochores that are of low abundance but if they constitute below 20% of the entire population
of Mps1 they are easy to detect.
4) Figure 2: They indicate that TPR domain binds Hec1 (I think they should change Hec1 to
Ndc80 as this is what they use in the text) but in the text they state that no binding partners has
been identified for the TPR domain....this is confusing.

This is an excellent review on an important protein kinase. Only a few minor changes are
needed:
1) page 4: additional model system refs should be added, clarifying how this kinase was first
shown to be a key SAC component (Winey and Murray labs, budding yeast).
2) Line 77. Why is Mps1 kinase essential, if the SAC is not? Please clarify.
3) Line 325. There is quite a lot of evidence supporting a diffusible mode of Mps1 action (and
MCC assembly?) away from kinetochores. A few references should be added here, in support of
this.
4) Line 329. Mps1
5) Figs 2-3. The authors do a good job here, of summarising a complex series of regulatory
kinetochore interactions.

Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
5
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Dear David,
Many thanks for the swift review and the positive comments on our manuscript, which we
hereby submit in revised form.
A point-by-point rebuttal to reviewers comments is attached to this letter.
I hope you now find our manuscript acceptable for publication in Open Biology.
Kind regards,

Rebuttal
Referee 1
1) We have added a sentence at the end of section 7 highlighting the potential
relevance of the different modes of binding. This comes back more subtly in section
9 where we take a step back to follow Mps1 through a round of mitosis.
2) In section 8 about silencing and more specifically where we mention the contribution
of phosphatases, we briefly mention the contribution of Aurora B to recruitment of
PP1 via the RVxF motif in Knl1.
3) Indeed, additional Mps1-kinetochore interaction cannot be excluded, yet have not
been observed. We now highglight this possibility at the end of section 5.
4) It was not the intention of Figure 2 to show an interaction between the TPR and HEC1
- we have changed the relative sizes of the proteins in the figure to make this more
clear (the TPR is now not touching HEC1).
We propose to keep HEC1 named as is in the figure, as the different modes of binding
we depict here have, so far, only conclusively been shown in human cells. We try to
make it clear in the text but also now in the figure legend that we are only talking
about the human situation here.
5) The typo has been corrected – thank you for the observation.
Referee 2
1) Indeed, references were missing. We added them and mention how Mps1 first came
to be associated with a checkpoint.
2) The SAC is essential in some model organisms, in others not. Mps1 is potentially more
essential due to its involvement in various processes outside the SAC such as error
correction. We have added a sentence to reflect this in the text.
3) References were added to mention reports of non-kinetochore Mps1 activity and
MCC assembly. They have mostly been reported as important at the onset of mitosis
– we are curious as to whether non-kinetochore Mps1 activity is important for
maintenance of a mitotic arrest. We try to make this more clear in the text.
4) Typo was corrected – thank you for the observation.
5) The comment is much appreciated.
