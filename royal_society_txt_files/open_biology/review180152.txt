Although several reviews on the transcription factor GATA3 have been published to date, this
manuscript by Zaidan and Ottersbach has a unique and interesting focus on the role of GATA3 in
hematopoietic development, and particularly in the emergence of hematopoetic stemcells in the
embryo. This review was a pleasure to read. Within the field of hematopoiesis it is
comprehensive and contains an informative in-depth discussion on all the supportive evidence
for our current view of the role of GATA3 (which is also nicely illustrated in Figure 3).
I only have a few minor comments.
Page 5. The sentence “Gata1 induces megakaryocyte and erythrocyte development, while
preventing granulocyte-monocyte and lymphoid commitment” is quite confusing, since Gata3 is
also expressed in granulocytes, including eosinophils as is clear from the next sentence. This
should be rephrased. Likewise, the sentence linking Gata2 to HSC is confusing as GATA2 is e.g.
also involved in mast cell development.
Page 7. When the importance of the level of GATA3 is discussed, it would be nice to include
some older literature the phenotype of GATA3 overexpression, e.g. leading to thymocyte tumors
(Nawijn et al., J immunol. 2001 ) or mast cell lineage diversion (Taghon et al., Nat Immunol.
2007).
Pages 10/11. For the role of GATA3 in breast tumors, I suggest to mention estrogen sensitivity
(because it is very important in the clinic). GATA3 is a regulator of estrogen receptor expression
as it binds to regulatory elements in the ERalpha locus.
Page 11. Gata3 is also involved in ear development. Although this is surely not the focus of this
review, the authors may consider to mention the human condition, HDR syndrome, that is
caused by GATA3 haplo-insufficiency whereby deadness is one

The well-written review by Zaidan and Ottersbach focuses on the critical GATA factor GATA-3,
which has not been thoroughly considered in recent reviews. Given the unique facets of GATA-3
biology and potential mechanisms, this represents a timely and important article, and only minor
changes are suggested below to increase accurate of two citations.
1) “when Gata1 is expressed, Gata2 is displaced” etc – The authors cite reference 22, a review
from M. Yamamoto’s group. However, this finding was demonstrated by Grass et al. PNAS 2003
and developed in multiple subsequent papers in the Bresnick group (e.g., reviewed in Bresnick et
al. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; Katsumura et al. Blood 2017).
2) “as Gata2 is required for their emergence”. The authors cite de Pater, but not the co-published
Gao et al. JEM 2013, which rigorously established a GATA-2 requirement for HSC emergence.
Gao et al. also described GATA-2 regulation of Runx1 expression in the AGM, in the context of
HSC emergence.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewers:
We thank the reviewers for their positive comments and for highlighting
inconsistencies and missing references. We have corrected these in the manuscript,
with changes shown in red. Below are also detailed responses to the individual
comments made by the reviewers.
Referee 1:
Although several reviews on the transcription factor GATA3 have been published to
date, this manuscript by Zaidan and Ottersbach has a unique and interesting focus on
the role of GATA3 in hematopoietic development, and particularly in the emergence
of hematopoetic stem cells in the embryo. This review was a pleasure to read. Within
the field of hematopoiesis it is comprehensive and contains an informative in-depth
discussion on all the supportive evidence for our current view of the role of GATA3
(which is also nicely illustrated in Figure 3).
I only have a few minor comments.
Page 5. The sentence “Gata1 induces megakaryocyte and erythrocyte development,
while preventing granulocyte-monocyte and lymphoid commitment” is quite
confusing, since Gata3 is also expressed in granulocytes, including eosinophils as is
clear from the next sentence. This should be rephrased. Likewise, the sentence linking
Gata2 to HSC is confusing as GATA2 is e.g. also involved in mast cell development.
We agree that these sentences were somewhat contradictory and have therefore
rephrased them slightly to better reconcile these different parts. They now read as
follows: “The main function of Gata1 is cell fate determination at an early branch point
in the haematopoietic tree, where it induces megakaryocyte and erythrocyte
development, while preventing granulocyte-monocyte and lymphoid commitment.
However, it is also expressed further downstream in common lymphoid and myeloid
progenitors, mast cells and eosinophils [16, 17]. The most critical role of Gata2 is the
formation and maintenance of HSCs [18, 19], although it has additional functions in
specific blood lineages as discussed below.”
Page 7. When the importance of the level of GATA3 is discussed, it would be nice to
include some older literature the phenotype of GATA3 overexpression, e.g. leading to
thymocyte tumors (Nawijn et al., J immunol. 2001 ) or mast cell lineage diversion
(Taghon et al., Nat Immunol. 2007).
We have now included these examples of the consequences of Gata3 overexpression
and have added the following sentence: “Indeed, enforced expression of Gata3 in the
T cell lineage caused a maturation arrest in the cytotoxic T cell lineage and promoted
the formation of thymic lymphoblastoid tumours [41], and overexpression of Gata3 at
early foetal thymocyte stages redirected their differentiation towards the mast cell
lineage [42].”
Pages 10/11. For the role of GATA3 in breast tumors, I suggest to mention estrogen
sensitivity (because it is very important in the clinic). GATA3 is a regulator of estrogen
receptor expression as it binds to regulatory elements in the ERalpha locus.
We have now also included a couple of sentences on the regulation of ERalpha
expression and oestrogen-responsiveness by GATA3 in breast cancer: “The
involvement of GATA3 in breast cancer, however, is complex as it was also shown to
promote the growth of oestrogen-responsive tumours through direct binding to and
activation of the oestrogen receptor <U+F061> (ER<U+F061>) gene [85]. ER<U+F061>-positive tumours display
a more differentiated phenotype and are generally less aggressive, which may be
another reason why GATA3 expression in breast cancer is associated with a more
favourable prognosis [86-88].”
Page 11. Gata3 is also involved in ear development. Although this is surely not the
focus of this review, the authors may consider to mention the human condition, HDR
syndrome, that is caused by GATA3 haplo-insufficiency whereby deadness is one
We have now added a section on inner ear development and HDR syndrome on page
10 to represent the full spectrum of GATA3 involvement in human disease.
Referee 2:
The well-written review by Zaidan and Ottersbach focuses on the critical GATA factor
GATA-3, which has not been thoroughly considered in recent reviews. Given the
unique facets of GATA-3 biology and potential mechanisms, this represents a timely
and important article, and only minor changes are suggested below to increase
accurate of two citations.
1) “when Gata1 is expressed, Gata2 is displaced” etc – The authors cite reference 22,

Grass et al. PNAS 2003 and developed in multiple subsequent papers in the Bresnick
group (e.g., reviewed in Bresnick et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; Katsumura et al. Blood
2017).
We apologise for the omission of these relevant references, which we have now added
on page 5.
2) “as Gata2 is required for their emergence”. The authors cite de Pater, but not the
co-published Gao et al. JEM 2013, which rigorously established a GATA-2 requirement
for HSC emergence. Gao et al. also described GATA-2 regulation of Runx1 expression
in the AGM, in the context of HSC emergence.
Again we apologise for the omission of this important study, which we now reference
on pages 5 and 6.
