General comments
Usually this lab produces excellent articles which this reviewer very much enjoys reading.
Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Given the nice piece of work generating the knockout
strain of subunit zeta the authors have in hand, this reviewer strongly encourage them to closely
examine the suggestions made if they wish to explore function.
The title insinuates that the manuscript is to describe mechanism of subunit zeta regulation of the
Paracoccus denitrificans F1Fo ATP synthase. The timing of the study is a perfect follow-on from
the observations of the Garcia-Trejo laboratory, and the extremely informative structure of the
Walker laboratory. Yet, the manuscript did not live up to its title. While it was an attempt at
describing a holistic view of regulation in light of the role of subunit zeta (it is a subunit, not ‘The
<U+03B6> protein’ as referred to throughout the manuscript – please respect the established
conventions), there was no direct evidence of the mechanism of regulation by the subunit zeta in
this article. What the authors did show was how removing subunit zeta did not affect the
hydrolysis/synthesis activity observed. Showing that the removal of subunit zeta did not affect
the activity under the conditions tested does not automatically show a mechanism simply
because ADP regulation is ‘likely’. It simply suggests that subunit zeta likely has a role in another
condition, such as a stress response. Surprisingly the authors did not perform and grow
experiments to test this. This is lazy science, but then again the tone of the article suggests that
describing subunit zeta function was not even the intended purpose, and the writer is seemingly
upset about it: ‘Our motivation was to activate the P. denitrificans ATP synthase to catalyze ATP
hydrolysis, and then to use it to create a proton motive force in P. denitrificans sub-bacterial
particles (SBPs), to enable measurements used routinely in bovine sub mitochondrial particles
(SMPs) [31] to be transferred to the P. denitrificans system. However, removing the <U+03B6> protein
does not substantially activate ATP hydrolysis’.
Strangely this manuscript relied on kinetics to support claims without showing a single kinetic
trace. However, this reviewer completely agrees that the evidence provided strongly indicates
that the loss of subunit zeta does not appear to have a large effect on overall hydrolysis under the
conditions examined. A nice observation; however, the numbers are rather low compared to
current literature, so this reviewer wonders if hydrolysis might be amplified in their preparations
if the data was not so low?
This particular statement is curious given the lack of experimental evidence to support it:
‘Although the <U+03B6> protein in P. denitrificans adopts a similar binding mode to the IF1
inhibitor proteins of eukaryotic ATPases, the <U+03B6> protein is a permanently-bound subunit…’ (page
3
10, line 228). ‘Permanently’ is a very strong statement; there is no published evidence to support
this to this reviewer’s knowledge. Permanently bound implies that it is bound under all
conditions, the authors did not perform growth experiments under various conditions to support
this statement. It is far too broad. In the same vein, the authors simply did not write to their
results in the most part, they wrote to common theories such as ADP regulation without ever
actually directly showing it, or even attempting to do so.
The most impressive pieces of work about the manuscript is the knockout. This was unequivocal,
yet given this powerful methodology, surprisingly, the authors ignore any possible subunit
epsilon role in regulation, where they could have truncated the C-terminal helix of subunit
epsilon and completed the picture to make a more conclusive study. Although it is noted that
current literature indirectly shows perhaps the subunit epsilon likely has a different role in P.
denitrificans, it has not been directly observed by the Garcia-Trejo group, leaving it open to these
authors, yet they seem to ignore subunit epsilon and claim ADP regulation. This reviewer see’s
this as a short cut to publish the work rather than a through analysis of function.The authors
reference a recent C. thermarum structure by Ferguson et al that also claims that ADP regulation.
That article also lacked direct evidence of ADP-regulation and both that study and this claim
ADP-regulation simply because the crystal structures were found in the same conformation with
ADP in the active sites with subunit epsilon down. These are snapshots, not functional kinetics.
Yet E. coli structures of the F1 sub-complex have also been found with epsilon in both down and
up states, therefore, it is still questionable, and cannot be ignored as has been done here. What
would have been direct evidence is single-molecule data showing ADP regulation in both cases.
This has been achieved several times before and should be conducted, especially since this theory
is not novel. There are several world-leading experts the authors could have collaborated with to
achieve this (Frasch, Noji, Borsch, Berry laboratories for example). Likewise with the actual study
- perhaps the Garcia-Trejo laboratory that the authors seem so keen on discounting the studies of?
Lastly, there are sections of the manuscript that are rather poorly written.
Statements such as:
- ‘catalyze ATP synthesis rapidly’ (page 5, line 78) which could have been written ‘rapidly
catalyze the formation of ATP’
AND
- ‘It has also been linked to the C terminus of the e subunit [23], but structural and mutagenesis
data on the C. thermarum enzyme (see Figure 1) have questioned this relationship also’ (page 5,
line 67-69). Placing ‘also’ at the end of a sentence is not grammatically correct.
These types of errors are very easily fixed, and should have been corrected during the drafting.
Suggestions:
- The authors need to show at least example kinetics if they are going to rely on it to prove their
points. It should at the very least be in the supplementary section.
- Perform conditional growth experiments with the delta zeta strain to find out the physiological
function considering it clearly capable of binding to the P. denitrificans enzyme as shown by the
crystal structure. Once they find said conditional effect they should then induce zeta expression
to see if function can be restored.
- If the authors want to claim ADP inhibition then they need to show it directly instead of
‘writing to it’. Do the experiments and prove it.
- Perhaps the authors might be better off collaborating with the Garcia-Trejo laboratory to reveal
why the very large rate differences in activation, adding something of more meaning to the field
is rather than focusing on critiquing.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
The manuscript by Varghese et al. presents straightforward project describing an effect of the
zeta-subunit knock-out in Paracoccus denitrificans cells on their ability to respire and to
synthesize and hydrolyze ATP. Original studies by the group of Jose J. García-Trejo showed that
the zeta-subunit acts as an inhibitor of the hydrolytic activity of the FoF1 ATP synthase complex.
Interestingly, in contrast to mitochondrial inhibitory peptide IF1, which binds to FoF1-ATPase
only when there is a need to inhibit the hydrolytic function of the complex, the zeta-subunit is a
permanently-bound subunit and remains bound to the complex during the forward as well as
reverse reactions of the complex.
In contrast to expectations, the presented manuscript shows that the rate of ATP hydrolysis in
subbacterial particles (SBPs), and also by purified F1-ATPase complex, was increased only
moderately in the mutant knock-out cells. Moreover, the rates for ATP hydrolysis in SBPs from
knock-out cells were extremely low in comparison to those of bovine submitochondrial particles.
This is a surprising finding since there is a substantial evidence that overexpressed and purified
zeta-subunit is able to inhibit stimulated ATPase activity of the P. denitrificans F1 and FoF1
complexes. Moreover, purified complexes with lower content of zeta and epsilon subunits
showed larger activation of the ATPase activity. Here, authors concluded their findings by two
possible mechanisms. First one involves the presence of subunit epsilon and its putative role in
blocking the hydrolysis in the zeta-free FoF1 ATPase. Second one includes a possibility of
formation of a stable ADP-bound state, from which the enzyme can not escape in the hydrolysis
direction. While the presented manuscript offers exciting and surprising findings, further genetic
and structural work is needed to shed light on this phenomena.

Comments for the manuscript:
1. Is zeta-subunit essential for the P. denitrifican cells? Is it possible that during the selection for
knocked-out cells there is a pressure to create a random mutant, in which the FoF1 ATP synthase
complex will be trapped in stable-on pathway state?
2. Page 4, lanes 80 – 83 - this statement is a little bit confusing to me, since after reading the
Zarco-Zavala paper I came to a different conclusion. Zarco-Zavalo states on page 2149, second
column, top paragraph: „Furthermore, removal of both subunits (epsilon and zeta) to obtain
alpha, beta, delta, gamma subcomplex, decreased to about half the sulfite-activated PdF1-ATPase
activity from 20-25umol/min/mg (see Fig.3) to 12umol/min/mg (Fig.1)“ However, they also
state that „ removal of 30% of the endogenous zeta increase 5-fold the PdF1-ATPase turnover,
from 0.88 to 4.5 umol/min/mg in the presence of 0.15% LDAO. Since these two statements seem
to be a little bit contradictory and in my opinion the ATPase activity of the complex differs
between the purifications and depends on ratio of zeta and epsilon subunits which remain to be
bound to the complex. I would just simply state:
„Addition of a recombinant form of the zeta subunit to P. denitrificans F1-ATPase complex
resulted in substantial decrease of the sulfite-stimulated rate of ATP hydrolysis.“
3. Table 3 and 4 – for at least some measurements it would be nice to have a control with the F1-
ATPase inhibitor or to have an add-back experiment with recombinant zeta-subunit to confirm
that the increase in the activation of ATP hydrolysis is due to the lack of zeta-subunit.
4. In Morales-Ríos et al, 2010 paper, on page 64 it is clearly shown that during the purification of
F1Fo and F1 complexes the epsilon and zeta subunits dissociate and this might be the reason for
the observed higher ATPase activity of this enzyme. Interestingly, the similar preparation of the
F1-ATPase subcomplex presented in this manuscript (Fig.3C) shows almost no decrease in
epsilon and zeta subunits in the case when complex was purified from wt cells and no obvious
decrease in the epsilon subunit in the case when complex was purified from the knock-out cells.
Densiometry analysis is highly recommended of the stained gels presented in Fig 3C and the
obtained results should be discussed in relation to published data in Morales-Rios et al., 2010
5. Last, but not least, it would have been great if authors would created the epsilon knock-out
cells or even a double knock-out of epsilon and zeta subunit and analyzed these cell lines by the
measurements of specific activities for ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis. I understand that it
goes beyond the scope of this report, however it would really increase the impact of the
presented manuscript.
6. Discussion, lanes 204 – 207 – Is this statement correct? After reading the original paper by
Zarco-Zavala and co-workers, I am not able to find calculations that would justify this statement.
The activity of the F1 complex (minus epsilon and zeta subunits) was reported to be 12.22
ug/min/mg, while the activity of the complete F1 complex was reported to be 20-25
ug/min/mg.

The inability of the P. denitrificans ATP synthase to hydrolyse ATP has been a puzzle for over 40
years. Unexpectedly, the content of this paper does solve it. This is completely contrary to my
expectation. In that sense the paper contains important negative evidence. A few minor points.
1. line 14 of Abstract: ATP hydrolysis ???
2. Page 6 line 146, 10 mM Tris would be pH 10 or so. ?
3. Page 7 lines 168 etc. - might be wroth comparing the very early respiratory rates and RCR
values given by John & Whatley.Not sure how valid it is to compare SMPs with P. denitrificans
vesicles; copy number of Complex 1 and other complexes could be very different per mg protein.
4. Having had a quick look at ref 27 it seems that attempts were made to measure equilibrium
exchange between phosphate and ATP. Could the authors do that their inhibitor depleted
system. Hard to believe that such exchange would not be accelerated by inhibitor depletion.

Editor's Comments to Author(s):
All three reviewers and the Board Member found this work to be exciting and potentially
paradigm changing. However, two of the reviewers raise some substantive issues that need to
addressed before the manuscript can be reconsidered for publication. In particular, since your
findings refute the original hypothesis that the zeta-subunit is the inhibitor of the FoF1-ATPase
activity in Paracoccus denitrificans they feel that stronger experimental evidence is required to
support your case.
The reviewers propose a number of lines of investigation to do so. Perhaps the simplest of these
is to perform whole genome sequencing to rule out the possibility of other, possibly
compensatory, mutations in the knock-out mutant. In addition, two of the reviewers propose
that characterization of a knock-out mutant for the epsilon subunit might also help to substantiate
the results and conclusions. Additional useful suggestions were made in the reviews that, when
implemented, will improve the paper.
However, if you are no longer in a position to undertake any further experiments you may like to
8
consider transferring the paper to our sister journal, Open Science. Here, only minor revisions to
the text and addition of raw data are required.
Board Member's comments to the Author(s):
Reviewer 1 is rather brusque in his manner, but both reviewer 1 and 2 comment on the need for
further KO work involving the epsilon subunit of the Paracoccus ATP synthase - I did wonder if
this would come out in peer review and whilst I am not sure if this is technically demanding or
not, the fact that the data from Hirst et al. are so surprising and contradictory to the work of
another group means in my view the onus is on the authors to do the additional work in order to
ideally resolve the conundrum.
Alternatively, if the KO work is technically demanding, then the authors could/should address
point 1 of reviewer 2 - compensatory mutations are all the more likely if the KO was technically
demanding or not efficient. Yet, the indication of additional mutations between parent and KO
clones is easy addressed by cheap next generation sequencing approaches and analysis.
So, in summary, I'm supportive of publication but unfortunately only after some additional work
- either epsilon KO or sequencing parent and zeta KO. I suspect a request for additional work
makes it 'major revision'.
In its current, equivocal form more suited to publication in Open Science? Here, only minor
revisions to the text and addition of raw data are required.
The request for the raw data to be published as supplementary by reviewer 1 is also appropriate
and speaks to the drive from Royal Society towards transparency in data publication.

system. Hard to believe that such exchange would not be accelerated by inhibitor depletion.

This is now an excellent manuscript - it is great to see it in this much better shape. The authors
have provided a much more balanced argument and reigned in some of the 'broader' statements.
It is also clearer, much better written and constructed. It will provide much interesting discussion
in the field.
I have 1 minor comment/request: and that is in lines 225-274 the authors state two possibilities:
that the epsilon subunit could be a factor influencing ATP hydrolysis or ADP. The argument as
written favours ADP due to a relatively recent crystallographic study (Ferguson et al 2016; lines

C.thermarum is in contrast to the earlier biochemical study of Keis et al 2006 (J.Bac. Vol 188,

This should be discussed briefly, and Keis et al 2006 referenced to create a balanced viewpoint on

Dear Editor,
Thank you for the comments on our manuscript (RSOB-17-0206) originally entitled “Role of
he IF1-like <U+03B6> subunit in unidirectional catalysis by Paracoccus denitrificans ATP synthase”.
We have now revised our manuscript in response to these comments and your editorial
ecommendations, and are submitting the new version, along with a detailed documentation
of the changes made (below) for your consideration. In order to satisfy the reviewers’
comments we have changed the title, and carried out a number of further experiments - and
herefore have added an additional author to our manuscript.
We hope that our revised manuscript will now prove worthy of publication in Open Biol.
Yours faithfully,
Judy Hirst
on behalf of all authors)
Editor's Comments
All three reviewers and the Board Member found this work to be exciting and potentially
paradigm changing. However, two of the reviewers raise some substantive issues that need to
addressed before the manuscript can be reconsidered for publication. In particular, since
your findings refute the original hypothesis that the zeta-subunit is the inhibitor of the FoF1-
ATPase activity in Paracoccus denitrificans they feel that stronger experimental evidence is
required to support your case.
The reviewers propose a number of lines of investigation to do so. Perhaps the simplest of
hese is to perform whole genome sequencing to rule out the possibility of other, possibly
compensatory, mutations in the knock-out mutant. In addition, two of the reviewers propose
hat characterization of a knock-out mutant for the epsilon subunit might also help to
substantiate the results and conclusions. Additional useful suggestions were made in the
reviews that, when implemented, will improve the paper.
We have now sequenced the two operons that encode all the subunits of the Paracoccus ATP
synthase in the knock-out strain. We found that the sequences match the sequences from the
wild-type exactly (described on page 5, lines 135-138). We note that our ATP hydrolysis data
ely solely on catalysis by the ATPase enzyme itself, not on any other pathway or enzyme,
and therefore these sequence data exclude the possibility of one or more compensatory
mutations preventing hydrolysis in the absence of the zeta protein. We are grateful to the
eviewers for suggesting this experiment (which we should not have omitted to carry out in
he first place).
Regarding the epsilon subunit: simply knocking out epsilon would inevitably destroy the ATP
synthesis functionality of the enzyme. However, having demonstrated that removing the zeta
subunit is not sufficient to activate hydrolysis, we agree that the C-terminus of epsilon has
become a more promising (but not unique) candidate for the inhibitory
component/mechanism. We are now pursuing this line of enquiry: we have designed
runcations of epsilon to remove the C-terminal domain but leave the catalytically-essential
N-terminal domain intact, and have begun to create the constructs to produce the variant
strains. However, genetic manipulations of the Paracoccus genome (requiring conjugation
1
with E. coli and homologous recombination in a genome with extremely high GC content) are
non-trivial experimentally and this work requires a substantial new investment of time and
effort. We consider manipulation of the epsilon subunit a ‘new project’ and wish to publish
our results on the zeta subunit, as a distinct and specific conclusion, without further delay.
mportantly, our current manuscript does not claim to define why the Paracoccus ATPase is
unable to hydrolyse efficiently, but only to show that hydrolysis is not activated (contrary to
expectations) by deleting the zeta subunit.
Board Member's comments
Reviewer 1 is rather brusque in his manner, but both reviewer 1 and 2 comment on the need
or further KO work involving the epsilon subunit of the Paracoccus ATP synthase - I did
wonder if this would come out in peer review and whilst I am not sure if this is technically
demanding or not, the fact that the data from Hirst et al. are so surprising and contradictory
o the work of another group means in my view the onus is on the authors to do the additional
work in order to ideally resolve the conundrum.
Alternatively, if the KO work is technically demanding, then the authors could/should address
point 1 of reviewer 2 - compensatory mutations are all the more likely if the KO was
echnically demanding or not efficient. Yet, the indication of additional mutations between
parent and KO clones is easy addressed by cheap next generation sequencing approaches
and analysis.
So, in summary, I'm supportive of publication but unfortunately only after some additional
work - either epsilon KO or sequencing parent and zeta KO. I suspect a request for additional
work makes it 'major revision'.
Please see our responses to the comments from the Editor above.
The request for the raw data to be published as supplementary by reviewer 1 is also
appropriate and speaks to the drive from Royal Society towards transparency in data
publication.
Reviewer 1 requested to see examples of kinetic traces and we have now included them in
Figure 4, demonstrating both the principle of the measurement and the high quality of the data
obtained and used in this work.
Referee 1
Usually this lab produces excellent articles which this reviewer very much enjoys reading.
Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Given the nice piece of work generating the knockout
strain of subunit zeta the authors have in hand, this reviewer strongly encourages them to
closely examine the suggestions made if they wish to explore function.
We understand that the reviewer is questioning the wider interpretations we have drawn from
our data, not the quality or extent of our experimental work. However, the comment itself is
not specific, and as the reviewer provided more detail below we have chosen to respond to the
specific comments provided there.
2
The title insinuates that the manuscript is to describe mechanism of subunit zeta regulation of
he Paracoccus denitrificans F1Fo ATP synthase.
We apologise for the confusion as we did not intend to ‘insinuate’ anything. In retrospect we
understand that our title may have been open to misinterpretation, since it may have been
aken to imply that the zeta subunit does play an important role in making catalysis
unidirectional. We intended our title to convey the questioning of this assumption, not its
confirmation. We have therefore amended our title to “Deleting the IF1-like <U+03B6> subunit from
Paracoccus denitrificans ATP synthase is not sufficient to activate ATP hydrolysis” and hope
hat this is now clear.
The timing of the study is a perfect follow-on from the observations of the Garcia-Trejo
aboratory, and the extremely informative structure of the Walker laboratory. Yet, the
manuscript did not live up to its title. While it was an attempt at describing a holistic view of
regulation in light of the role of subunit zeta (it is a subunit, not ‘The <U+03B6> protein’ as referred to
hroughout the manuscript – please respect the established conventions), there was no direct
evidence of the mechanism of regulation by the subunit zeta in this article.
We have now amended our title as described above.
Regarding the term zeta subunit or protein, we have deferred to the reviewer’s requirement
and adopted the established convention of referring to the zeta subunit. However, we are not
completely comfortable with the accuracy of this terminology: we note that (below) the
eviewer him/herself questions whether the zeta subunit is in fact a permanently bound
constitutent of the enzyme, which we understand to be the technical definition of a subunit.
What the authors did show was how removing subunit zeta did not affect the
hydrolysis/synthesis activity observed. Showing that the removal of subunit zeta did not affect
he activity under the conditions tested does not automatically show a mechanism simply
because ADP regulation is ‘likely’. It simply suggests that subunit zeta likely has a role in
another condition, such as a stress response. Surprisingly the authors did not perform and
grow experiments to test this. This is lazy science, but then again the tone of the article
suggests that describing subunit zeta function was not even the intended purpose, and the
writer is seemingly upset about it: ‘Our motivation was to activate the P. denitrificans ATP
synthase to catalyze ATP hydrolysis, and then to use it to create a proton motive force in P.
denitrificans sub-bacterial particles (SBPs), to enable measurements used routinely in bovine
sub mitochondrial particles (SMPs) [31] to be transferred to the P. denitrificans system.
However, removing the <U+03B6> protein does not substantially activate ATP hydrolysis’.
1. Our conclusion is that deleting the zeta subunit is not sufficient to activate hydrolysis, so in
ts absence at least one other effect or component must prevent the hydrolysis reaction. The
possibilities we identified were a domain of the epsilon subunit and bound ADP. We discuss
both of these suggestions and do not favor one over the other. For Paracoccus, it is possible
hat future work on the epsilon subunit may help to resolve this issue.
2. We have now included growth curves on three different substrates as Supplementary Figure
1 (referred to on page 8, line 249). Deletion of the zeta subunit has no effect on cell growth.
3. Our statement on the motivation for this study was honest and not intended to cause
offence. We have now removed it.
3
Strangely this manuscript relied on kinetics to support claims without showing a single kinetic
race.
We have now included example kinetic traces in Figure 4.
However, this reviewer completely agrees that the evidence provided strongly indicates that
he loss of subunit zeta does not appear to have a large effect on overall hydrolysis under the
conditions examined. A nice observation; however, the numbers are rather low compared to
current literature, so this reviewer wonders if hydrolysis might be amplified in their
preparations if the data was not so low?
We are pleased the reviewer agrees with our conclusion that loss of the zeta subunit does not
substantially affect hydrolysis. Regarding the low rates, we agree that the rates of hydrolysis
we observe with the isolated F1 domain are lower than those from Garcia and coworkers. Part
of the difference is due to the different conditions employed, and part may be due to lack of
he epsilon subunit in Garcia’s preparations. However, a major problem with studying the
solated F1 domain is that it is not possible to confirm its functionality by carrying out ATP
synthesis assays. For this reason we place substantially more emphasis on our results from the
ntact, integral enzyme, because its inherent catalytic functionality can be confirmed in this
way. As noted on page 6 our observed rates for both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis in this
case are comparable to values reported previously. In any case, the data from both systems
agree on the common conclusion that deleting zeta does not activate hydrolysis.
This particular statement is curious given the lack of experimental evidence to support it:
Although the <U+03B6> protein in P. denitrificans adopts a similar binding mode to the IF1
nhibitor proteins of eukaryotic ATPases, the <U+03B6> protein is a permanently-bound subunit…’
page 10, line 228). ‘Permanently’ is a very strong statement; there is no published evidence
o support this to this reviewer’s knowledge. Permanently bound implies that it is bound
under all conditions, the authors did not perform growth experiments under various
conditions to support this statement. It is far too broad. In the same vein, the authors simply
did not write to their results in the most part, they wrote to common theories such as ADP
regulation without ever actually directly showing it, or even attempting to do so.
1. We agree that there is no evidence to confirm that zeta is permanently bound – although it
s not easily lost from the complex during purification, or displaced and lost following
synthesis. We have now amended our text (page 8, line 229-30) to read ‘is generally
considered to be a permanently-bound subunit’. We note that use of the term ‘subunit’ rather
han ‘protein’ (as required by this reviewer in a comment above) further implies permanent
binding.
2. As noted above, we now present growth curves in the Supplementary Figure 1.
3. Our conclusion is that deleting the zeta subunit is not sufficient to activate hydrolysis, so in
ts absence at least one other effect or component must prevent the hydrolysis reaction. The
possibilities we identified were a domain of the epsilon subunit and bound ADP, and we do
not favor one over the other. It is reasonable to consider these two alternatives in the
discussion section of our manuscript.

The most impressive pieces of work about the manuscript is the knockout. This was
unequivocal, yet given this powerful methodology, surprisingly, the authors ignore any
possible subunit epsilon role in regulation, where they could have truncated the C-terminal
helix of subunit epsilon and completed the picture to make a more conclusive study. Although
t is noted that current literature indirectly shows perhaps the subunit epsilon likely has a
different role in P. denitrificans, it has not been directly observed by the Garcia-Trejo group,
eaving it open to these authors, yet they seem to ignore subunit epsilon and claim ADP
regulation. This reviewer see’s this as a short cut to publish the work rather than a through
analysis of function.
We agree that, having demonstrated that removing the zeta subunit is not sufficient to activate
hydrolysis, the C-terminus of epsilon has become a more promising (but not unique)
candidate for the inhibitory component/mechanism. We are now pursuing this line of enquiry:
we have designed truncations of epsilon to remove the C-terminal domain but leave the
catalytically-essential N-terminal domain intact, and have begun to create the constructs to
produce the variant strains. However, genetic manipulations of the Paracoccus genome
requiring conjugation with E. coli and homologous recombination in a genome with
extremely high GC content) are non-trivial experimentally and this work requires a substantial
new investment of time and effort. We consider manipulation of the epsilon subunit a ‘new
project’ and wish to publish our results on the zeta subunit, as a distinct and specific
conclusion, without further delay. As noted above, we consider both the C-terminus of
epsilon and bound ADP as candidates for the inhibitory component/mechanism in the zeta-
ree enzyme, and do not favor one over the other.
The authors reference a recent C. thermarum structure by Ferguson et al that also claims that
ADP regulation. That article also lacked direct evidence of ADP-regulation and both that
study and this claim ADP-regulation simply because the crystal structures were found in the
same conformation with ADP in the active sites with subunit epsilon down. These are
snapshots, not functional kinetics. Yet E. coli structures of the F1 sub-complex have also been
ound with epsilon in both down and up states, therefore, it is still questionable, and cannot
be ignored as has been done here.
We consider both the C-terminus of epsilon and bound ADP as candidates for the inhibitory
component/mechanism in the zeta-free Paracoccus enzyme, and do not favor one over the
other.
What would have been direct evidence is single-molecule data showing ADP regulation in
both cases. This has been achieved several times before and should be conducted, especially
since this theory is not novel. There are several world-leading experts the authors could have
collaborated with to achieve this (Frasch, Noji, Borsch, Berry laboratories for example).
Likewise with the actual study - perhaps the Garcia-Trejo laboratory that the authors seem so
keen on discounting the studies of?
1. Single molecule studies are clearly outside of the boundaries of the current study. Our ‘next
objective’ on this project is to assess the role of the C-terminus of the epsilon subunit. Should
his approach not provide an explanation we will then turn to the investigation of ADP
egulation as suggested.
2. We are not ‘keen on discounting’ the studies of Garcia and coworkers, we are keen on
understanding how ATP hydrolysis is prevented in Paracoccus ATP synthase, and we have
5
been very careful to give due credit to Garcia’s work on the Paracoccus enzyme – for
example, page 3 lines 80-4 and page 7 lines 220-24.
Lastly, there are sections of the manuscript that are rather poorly written.
Statements such as:
‘catalyze ATP synthesis rapidly’ (page 5, line 78) which could have been written
rapidly catalyze the formation of ATP’
AND
‘It has also been linked to the C terminus of the e subunit [23], but structural and
mutagenesis data on the C. thermarum enzyme (see Figure 1) have questioned this
relationship also’ (page 5, line 67-69). Placing ‘also’ at the end of a sentence is not
grammatically correct.
These types of errors are very easily fixed, and should have been corrected during the
drafting.
We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We prefer to avoid using split infinitives but
have removed ‘also’ from the end of the second sentence.
Suggestions:
The authors need to show at least example kinetics if they are going to rely on it to prove
heir points. It should at the very least be in the supplementary section.
As noted above, we have now included example kinetic traces in Figure 4.
Perform conditional growth experiments with the delta zeta strain to find out the
physiological function considering it clearly capable of binding to the P. denitrificans enzyme
as shown by the crystal structure. Once they find said conditional effect they should then
nduce zeta expression to see if function can be restored.
As noted above, we have now included data from growth experiments under different
conditions as Supplementary Figure 1. There is no difference between the wild-type and
knockout strains.
If the authors want to claim ADP inhibition then they need to show it directly instead
of ‘writing to it’. Do the experiments and prove it.
As noted above, we consider both the C-terminus of epsilon and bound ADP as candidates for
he inhibitory component/mechanism in the zeta-free Paracoccus enzyme, and do not favor
one over the other.
Perhaps the authors might be better off collaborating with the Garcia-Trejo laboratory to
reveal why the very large rate differences in activation, adding something of more meaning to
he field is rather than focusing on critiquing.
We will be delighted to provide the Garcia laboratory with the constructs discussed in this
study upon their request.

Referee 2
The manuscript by Varghese et al. presents a straightforward project describing an effect of
he zeta-subunit knock-out in Paracoccus denitrificans cells on their ability to respire and to
synthesize and hydrolyze ATP. Original studies by the group of Jose J. García-Trejo showed
hat the zeta-subunit acts as an inhibitor of the hydrolytic activity of the FoF1 ATP synthase
complex. Interestingly, in contrast to mitochondrial inhibitory peptide IF1, which binds to
FoF1-ATPase only when there is a need to inhibit the hydrolytic function of the complex, the
zeta-subunit is a permanently-bound subunit and remains bound to the complex during the
orward as well as reverse reactions of the complex.
n contrast to expectations, the presented manuscript shows that the rate of ATP hydrolysis in
subbacterial particles (SBPs), and also by purified F1-ATPase complex, was increased only
moderately in the mutant knock-out cells. Moreover, the rates for ATP hydrolysis in SBPs
rom knock-out cells were extremely low in comparison to those of bovine submitochondrial
particles. This is a surprising finding since there is a substantial evidence that overexpressed
and purified zeta-subunit is able to inhibit stimulated ATPase activity of the P. denitrificans
F1 and FoF1 complexes. Moreover, purified complexes with lower content of zeta and epsilon
subunits showed larger activation of the ATPase activity. Here, authors concluded their
indings by two possible mechanisms. First one involves the presence of subunit epsilon and
ts putative role in blocking the hydrolysis in the zeta-free FoF1 ATPase. Second one includes
a possibility of formation of a stable ADP-bound state, from which the enzyme can not escape
n the hydrolysis direction. While the presented manuscript offers exciting and surprising
indings, further genetic and structural work is needed to shed light on this phenomena.
1. Is zeta-subunit essential for the P. denitrifican cells? Is it possible that during the selection
or knocked-out cells there is a pressure to create a random mutant, in which the FoF1 ATP
synthase complex will be trapped in stable-on pathway state?
) We have now sequenced the two operons that encode all the subunits of the Paracoccus
ATP synthase in the knock-out strain. We found that the sequences match the sequences from
he wild-type exactly (described on page 5, lines 135-138). We note that our ATP hydrolysis
data rely solely on catalysis by the ATPase enzyme itself, not on any other pathway or
enzyme, and therefore these sequence data exclude the possibility of one or more
compensatory mutations preventing hydrolysis in the absence of the zeta protein. We are
grateful to the reviewer for suggesting this experiment (which we should not have omitted to
carry out in the first place).
i) We now present growth curves (Supplementary Figure 1) which demonstrate that deletion
of the zeta subunit does not affect cell growth. i.e. the zeta subunit is not essential.
2. Page 4, lanes 80 – 83 - this statement is a little bit confusing to me, since after reading the
Zarco-Zavala paper I came to a different conclusion. Zarco-Zavalo states on page 2149,
second column, top paragraph: „Furthermore, removal of both subunits (epsilon and zeta) to
obtain alpha, beta, delta, gamma subcomplex, decreased to about half the sulfite-activated
PdF1-ATPase activity from 20-25umol/min/mg (see Fig.3) to 12umol/min/mg (Fig.1)“
However, they also state that „ removal of 30% of the endogenous zeta increase 5-fold the
PdF1-ATPase turnover, from 0.88 to 4.5 umol/min/mg in the presence of 0.15% LDAO. Since
hese two statements seem to be a little bit contradictory and in my opinion the ATPase
7
activity of the complex differs between the purifications and depends on ratio of zeta and
epsilon subunits which remain to be bound to the complex. I would just simply state:
„Addition of a recombinant form of the zeta subunit to P. denitrificans F1-ATPase complex
resulted in substantial decrease of the sulfite-stimulated rate of ATP hydrolysis.“
We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion, which we have implemented in our
manuscript (page 3, lines 80-3). We have found it difficult to accurately summarise the work
described by Zarco-Zavala and coworkers, and appreciate the reviewer taking the time to
provide advice on this matter.
3. Table 3 and 4 – for at least some measurements it would be nice to have a control with the
F1-ATPase inhibitor or to have an add-back experiment with recombinant zeta-subunit to
confirm that the increase in the activation of ATP hydrolysis is due to the lack of zeta-subunit.
Although the rate of hydrolysis in the zeta knockout strain is increased slightly (less than two-
old) relative to in the wild-type it is still negligable in comparison to the rates from ATP-
hydrolysing enzymes (such as B. taurus), measured under equivalent conditions (see Table 2),
and on this basis we chose not to pursue experiments with the recombinant protein.
4. In Morales-Ríos et al, 2010 paper, on page 64 it is clearly shown that during the
purification of F1Fo and F1 complexes the epsilon and zeta subunits dissociate and this
might be the reason for the observed higher ATPase activity of this enzyme. Interestingly, the
similar preparation of the F1-ATPase subcomplex presented in this manuscript (Fig.3C)
shows almost no decrease in epsilon and zeta subunits in the case when complex was purified
rom wt cells and no obvious decrease in the epsilon subunit in the case when complex was
purified from the knock-out cells. Densiometry analysis is highly recommended of the stained
gels presented in Fig 3C and the obtained results should be discussed in relation to published
data in Morales-Rios et al., 2010
We understand from Morales-Ríos et al, 2010 that epsilon and zeta were only partially lost
during preparation of the F1 complex, not from F1FO (page 603 “regardless of the method
used to resolve the native PdF1FO complex, the 11-kDa protein was consistently bound….”).
We agree that loss of these subunits from the F1 prepared in 2010 was suggested to underpin
he increased ATP hydrolysis activities reported – and this was followed up by Zarco-Zavala
and the removal of both epsilon and zeta from F1 (discussed on page 7). In the F1
preparations used here (ref. 45, developed later by Morales-Ríos in Cambridge) epsilon is
clearly present in both strains, and zeta varies as expected. We carried out these experiments
simply to confirm that removing zeta did not have a different effect in F1 to in F1FO.
5. Last, but not least, it would have been great if authors would created the epsilon knock-out
cells or even a double knock-out of epsilon and zeta subunit and analyzed these cell lines by
he measurements of specific activities for ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis. I understand
hat it goes beyond the scope of this report, however it would really increase the impact of the
presented manuscript.
We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion – and also for recognising that it goes
beyond the scope of our current manuscript. We have already begun to pursue this line of
enquiry: we have designed truncations of epsilon to remove the C-terminal domain but leave
he catalytically-essential N-terminal domain intact, and have are creating constructs to
produce the variant strains. However, genetic manipulations of the Paracoccus genome
8
requiring conjugation with E. coli and homologous recombination in a genome with
extremely high GC content) are non-trivial experimentally and this work requires a substantial
new investment of time and effort. We consider manipulation of the epsilon subunit a ‘new
project’ and wish to publish our results on the zeta subunit, as a distinct and specific
conclusion, without further delay.
6. Discussion, lanes 204 – 207 – Is this statement correct? After reading the original paper by
Zarco-Zavala and co-workers, I am not able to find calculations that would justify this
statement. The activity of the F1 complex (minus epsilon and zeta subunits) was reported to
be 12.22 ug/min/mg, while the activity of the complete F1 complex was reported to be 20-25
ug/min/mg.
We thank the reviewer for noting this discrepancy. Upon revisiting the Zarco-Zavala
manuscript we have modified our statement to read ‘the ATPase activity of Pd-F1-ATPase…
ncreased substantially upon removal of the endogenous e and <U+03B6> subunits’. Although less
specific, we consider this consistent with all the data presented.
Referee: 3
The inability of the P. denitrificans ATP synthase to hydrolyse ATP has been a puzzle for over
40 years. Unexpectedly, the content of this paper does solve it. This is completely contrary to
my expectation. In that sense the paper contains important negative evidence.
We thank the reviewer for this supportive evaluation.
A few minor points.
1. line 14 of Abstract: ATP hydrolysis ???
Thank you very much for noting this error – ATP is indeed correct.
2. Page 6 line 146, 10 mM Tris would be pH 10 or so. ?
We have now clarified this statement: 10 mM Tris-SO4 (pH 7.4) buffer.
3. Page 7 lines 168 etc. - might be wroth comparing the very early respiratory rates and RCR
values given by John & Whatley.Not sure how valid it is to compare SMPs with P.
denitrificans vesicles; copy number of Complex 1 and other complexes could be very different
per mg protein.
) We have revisited the work from John and coworkers, but we have not found directly
comparable data on RCR values plus ATP synthesis rates that would add to the point made
here – specifically, that a high RCR value does not necessarily correlate to a high rate of ATP
synthesis. John and coworkers report RCR values of up to 3 (John and Hamilton 1971).
i) We agree that an exact comparison between SMPs and SBPs is not possible, and have now
ncluded a clause to state this on page 6 lines 169-70. However, the patterns of respiratory
complexes analysed by blue-native PAGE on both systems are similar, and broad
comparisons are possible. Rates of ATP synthesis do vary, and may be accounted for by
differences in enzyme composition and coupling (as noted), but the huge differences in the
9
ates of ATP hydrolysis observed, and importantly, the ratio between synthesis and hydrolysis
see Table 2) are not accounted for by these effects – and are the focus of our work.
4. Having had a quick look at ref 27 it seems that attempts were made to measure equilibrium
exchange between phosphate and ATP. Could the authors do that their inhibitor depleted
system. Hard to believe that such exchange would not be accelerated by inhibitor depletion.
We agree this would be an interesting experiment, since it would address the rate of exchange
at equilibrium. However, we are not currently qualified or equipped to carry out this
experiment with the required 32P isotope. We will consider collaborating to enable this
experiment in the future.
