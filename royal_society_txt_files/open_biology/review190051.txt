This review address two complementary subjects: One is to review mechanisms by which protein
synthesis and translation can be protected from inhibition by existing antibiotics. The second is to
survey 'exciting new directions' in the development of antibiotics targeting translation and
protein synthesis.
General comments.
I think the review is rather short, and does not seem especially comprehensive. I could imagine
another review that for example goes more comprehensively into all of the tet RPP genes, the
various specific mutations in ribosomal proteins conferring resistance to various drugs, and all of
the RMT genes and which nucleotides they modify and the effects that they have. In addition, I
think it is important to consider the fact that many translation-inhibiting antibiotics are limited in
their clinical use by their spectrum of antibacterial activity - some are ineffective against Gram-
negatives while others have a very broad spectrum. Compared to my hypothetical review, this
review seems superficial. On the other hand, it functions as a quick, broad survey of the field of
resistance related to translation and protein synthesis.
At times I think it loses track of what it is supposed to be discussing in each section as well. The
antifungal tRNA synthetase drug section in particular seems like it doesn’t fit where it is.
Likewise the long discussion of EF-P (pages 8-9) is at best of marginal interest to clinical
antibiotics and resistance and could be greatly shortened or cut completely. Similarly for the long
discussion of rpoD and mistranslation.
I get the impression that the authors have placed an artificial limitation on themselves to only
discuss one or two examples of each phenomenon, which may be why the review often seems
superficial. The section where this is a serious problem is in the New Frontiers in Antibiotic
Development section where I don’t think they can have this section with only odilorhabdins as an
example. The Pew Trusts database maintains a listing of all antibiotics in clinical trials
development globally (current and past decade at least). I think the authors should consult this
database and include in their review information on the multiple new aminoglycosides,
tetracyclines, macrolides, oxalzolidinones, etc that are being brought through clinical trials or
have recently been approved for clinical use. For example, one interesting compound is a
chemical hybrid of an oxazolidinone and quinolone, dual targeting translation and
topoisomerase. This compound went all the way through Phase 3 clinical trials but development
has recently been suspended by the company. Nevertheless, I think it is important to bring this
hybrid up as an important example of a direction in which translation targeting antibiotics could
go. It would also be important to discuss why new variants of classical classes are being
developed - what problems are they addressing (in many cases it is connected with overcoming
resistance mechanisms and so should be of interest for this review).

Here are some line comments:
Line 56: Does halting protein synthesis rapidly lead to elimination of bacteria? Chloramphenicol
and Macrolides halt translation and are bacteriostatic.
Line 77 (Figure 1). Figure 1 serves to give a very general overview of important ribosomal
locations for antibiotic action. I think however, that the authors should consider including either
additional more detailed figures (or additional panels to this figure) showing the locations of
interaction of several specific classes of antibiotics , including the odilorhabdins.
Line 116. It is not correct to state that all S12 mutations come with a significant fitness cost.
Multiple publications have shown in various species, and in animal infections, that at least one
S12 mutations is essentially cost-free. As an example I suggest you include reference to a paper by
Erik Böttgers group showing a strong bias in favour of this mutation in resistant Mycobacterium
tuberculosis clinical isolates: Böttger et al, (1998) Nature Medicine 4, 1343-1344.
Line 129: As I read them, both of the citations propose or support models that TetO and TetM
dislodge bound tetracycline and induce a conformational change that prevents tetracycline
rebinding after the RPP has left. I did not see anything that indicated evidence for direct
competition for ribosomal binding between RPPs and tetracycline. I think you should rewrite this
section to better reflect the experimental evidence.
Line 135: ABCF needs to be defined and introduced for the uninitiated. It seems strange to
introduce them with their most important characteristic being that they are NTP hydrolases.
Line 159 - 160. I think you should give credit to the references with precedent for fusidic acid
resistance mutations in S. aureus. I suggest you include reference to Nagaev et al, (2001) Mol
Microbiol, 40, 433-439; and Laurberg et al (2000) J Mol Biol 303, 593-603.
Lines 186-219. I agree that EF-P is an interesting and important translation factor. However, it is
not a target for antibiotics and I think this section could be entirely removed (or reduced to a very
short comment on its potential as a future target).
Lines 221-248. Similarly to the above, mistranslation is interesting for ribosomologists but it is not
a significant player in antibiotic therapy and this section should either be removed or reduced to
a very short commentary on its potential for use.
Lines 236-239: In addition: This is very unclear to me and needs to be reworded to make the
intended meaning clear. I think that some of the unclearness may come from the introduction of
an ‘antibiotic resistance protein’ in the middle of this section.
Lines 272-280: This section about drugs targeting tRNA synthetases is out of place in a discussion
of resistance mechanisms. It should be moved to the New Frontiers in Antibiotic Development
section. I think that tRNA synthetases as novel drug targets should be discussed but you must be
more comprehensive and include the examples of GSK2251052 and the recent GSK Tuberculosis
tRNA synthetase inhibitors. You should also mention the one that has been on the market for
decades - mupirocin.
The New Frontiers in Antibiotic Development section should be expanded. There have been
other developments in translation targeting drugs other than odilorhadbdins. Please examine the
literature and especially the Pew Trust database (there are several ahminoglycosides and
tetracyclines and macrolides designed to overcome resistance mechanisms, for example).
4
Lines 331 - 346. It seems wrong to have this long speculation about modification of
chloramphenicol while ignoring the actual ahminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides etc that
are in clinical trials or recently approved.
Lines 347 - 355. Similar criticism to above - this text on modifications of neomycin is speculative
ribosomology rather than a discussion of developments in antibiotic development. In a long
review there would be a place for such speculations but not at the expense of ignoring all of the
developments that are actually occurring.
Lines 356 - 365. Same comments as above - you ignore the actual macrolides and ketolides in
development and instead return to discussing a potential resistance mechanism.
Lines 366 - 394. This section is very speculative and it would be better to devote text to actual
examples where an adjuvant has been shown to increase the potency of an antibiotic. There are
publications where adjuvants have for example been used to increase the entry of Gram-positive
antibiotic (macrolides) into Gram-negatives. These have not made it to the clinical yet but I think
it would be appropriate to discuss the potential of actual examples like this rather than purely
speculative examples (like mistranslation/kasugomycin and EttA ADP/ATP ratios).
Lines 409 - 416. I don't think the discussion of persisters is relevant to the review and certainly is
not a good way to end the review. Better to end with a summary of the major developments in
drug discovery in the area and the problems they are trying to address.

This review by Witzky et al. provides an overview of current knowledge of bacterial resistance
mechanisms against antibiotics that target the ribosome (and other components of the
translational machinery), along with discussion of work towards or new potential strategies that
might alleviate this important clinical problem. This significance of this topic is clearly high –
antibiotics that target protein synthesis have been critical in treatment of bacterial infection but
many (if not all) are threatened by one or more forms of resistance. The global threat of antibiotic
resistance is widely acknowledged, making this review of interest to a potentially wide audience.
As acknowledged by the authors, given the importance of these drugs and the topic in general,
several other detailed reviews have been published in recent years that cover topics of
translation-targeting antibiotics and their interactions with the ribosome, mechanism of action
and resistance mechanisms. However, the approach taken by the authors here to overview
resistance mechanisms together with substantial discussion of future perspectives on the
opportunities and challenges faced in overcoming this resistance gives the work a unique
perspective and makes it potentially a valuable contribution to this field.
While I am overall positive about the potential contribution of this work, to maximize its impact,
I encourage the authors carefully review a number of aspects of how the material is presented.
Three main aspects could be strengthened:
Eliminating a number of instances of vague or overly informal language, oversimplification of
important concepts, and the odd example of hyperbole (do bacteria really “run rampant”?).
While it is important for a review of this nature to be broadly accessible this should not come at
the expense of an appropriate level of accuracy and rigor (some examples are included in the
specific comments below).
A single, not especially useful figure is used to illustrate the entire discussion. This figure should
feature earlier and could be substantially improved e.g. label binding sites of the antibiotics and
resistance mechanisms discussed (e.g. where modifications or mutation lead to resistance). All
elements of the figure should be labeled (not just the subunits-mRNA, tRNA, nascent peptide). A
second panel summarizing the discussion of aaRS targeting antibiotics and resistance mechanism
would also be useful. More generally, many other aspects of the discussion would benefit from
illustrations – these could be structures of proteins (such as ribosome bound protection factors)
involved highlighting key features mentioned in the text, model figures summarizing mechanism
of action, etc.
In the section on adjuvant strategies (or in its own sub-section) the approach of directly inhibiting
resistance determinants (“resistance breakers”) should be included.
Specific comments and suggestions:
1. Line 56, “protein synthesis rapidly halts, leading to elimination of the bug”… how does the
drug eliminate? Bacteriostatic vs bactericidal activity, etc. (I also generally object to the use of the
term “bug”!)
2. Line 63, “bacteria rapidly evolving mechanisms of resistance”… not clear this entirely true;
resistance mechanisms can be acquired by gene transfer and also (as later noted) there is
compelling evidence for the ancient nature of resistance (pre-human use of antibiotics).
6
3. Line 75, specify “bacterial ribosome” (others are not 30S/50S)
4. Line 77,78 – include inducing miscoding as mechanism of action of aminoglycosides (this is
mentioned later but should be stated here)
5. Line 82, “Bacteria will often employ inducible methyltransferases”… this is not so clear cut and
could be described in a little more detail (how are they inducible, under what circumstances;
drug producer vs. acquired resistance enzyme in a pathogen, etc)
6. Line 86-87, statement that ribosome modification “often” creates a significant impediment
should be supported by references. Some elaboration may also be needed, e.g. it is not so clear cut
that this is the case for all aminoglycoside resistance.
7. Line 133, grammatical issue? (suggest “preventing tetracycline binding and removing drug
once bound”)
8. Line 156, “directly OR indirectly”
9. Line 165, mutations in rRNA, protein, both?
10. Line 168, this statement is misleading – EF-Tu hydrolyses GTP regardless of whether correct
codon-anticodon pairing occurs.
11. Line 181, ribosomes are not “permanently” inactivated – competitive inhibitor with a
dominant effect due to increased affinity.
12. Lines 212-220 (discussion of EF-P). Not really clear what the main take-away point is. here.
What is the evidence for high translational demand? Does need to evade immune system or
outcompete commensals depend on location/ type of infection/ pathogen? What about
dormancy (also an effective strategy to evade antibiotic treatment, also immune system)? Do
common commensals have EF-P and should this also be a consideration here?
13. Lines 229-239, I also found this description of RpsD mediated effects confusing. In line 236
why “also” maintains? (Isn’t the discussion about RpsD leading to mistranslation?) And, which
“antibiotic resistance protein” is referred to in Line 237?
14. Line 252-253, “non-cognate” is by definition in “the incorrect location”.
15. Line 323, while likely true at least in part, interspecies competition is probably not the only
reason for bacterial evolution of antibiotics (intra/ interspecies “communication”, regulation of
gene expression, etc). The wording here is also a little confusing in terms of natural vs. semi-
synthetic antibiotics: Line 324 appears refer to alteration of existing (natural) drugs; additionally,
there is no “this method” described in the preceding sentence and also the next sentence refers to
them as being “isolated” (which suggests the natural compounds themselves). Finally, the
paragraph ends with the statement that efforts have turned to chemical modification (which is
where it seemed start…).
16. Line 332, first reference to the figure (despite multiple prior mentions of tRNA binding sites or
other features).
17. Line 338, instability of what? The drug itself? (Chemical lability, greater sensitivity to
degradation). Is it shown that the alternative site isn’t just less effective for ribosome inhibition?
7
18. Line 339, “Derivatization of chloramphenicol can also… impact drug activity.” Isn’t this also
the case for the previous example? If so, why “also”? (It’s not completely clear but I assume here
“activity” refers to target or mechanism of action? However, even that changed in the previous
example as the ribosome binding site was altered).
19. Phrase “Translation is an essential process” is repeated in Line 396 & 403.

56: Does halting protein synthesis rapidly lead to elimination of bacteria? Chloramphenicol
Macrolides halt translation and are bacteriostatic.
s sentence has been reworded so it is clearer.
77 (Figure 1). Figure 1 serves to give a very general overview of important ribosomal
tions for antibiotic action. I think however, that the authors should consider including either
itional more detailed figures (or additional panels to this figure) showing the locations of
raction of several specific classes of antibiotics, including the odilorhabdins.
have modified this figure and added additional figures.
116. It is not correct to state that all S12 mutations come with a significant fitness cost.
tiple publications have shown in various species, and in animal infections, that at least one
mutations is essentially cost-free. As an example I suggest you include reference to a
er by Erik Böttgers group showing a strong bias in favour of this mutation in resistant
obacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates: Böttger et al, (1998) Nature Medicine 4, 1343-
4.
have added this information to the review.
129: As I read them, both of the citations propose or support models that TetO and TetM
odge bound tetracycline and induce a conformational change that prevents tetracycline
nding after the RPP has left. I did not see anything that indicated evidence for direct
petition for ribosomal binding between RPPs and tetracycline. I think you should rewrite this
tion to better reflect the experimental evidence.
s section has been clarified.
135: ABCF needs to be defined and introduced for the uninitiated. It seems strange to
oduce them with their most important characteristic being that they are NTP hydrolases.
s section has been clarified.
159 - 160. I think you should give credit to the references with precedent for fusidic acid
stance mutations in S. aureus. I suggest you include reference to Nagaev et al, (2001) Mol
robiol, 40, 433-439; and Laurberg et al (2000) J Mol Biol 303, 593-603.
se citations have been added.
s 186-219. I agree that EF-P is an interesting and important translation factor. However, it is
a target for antibiotics and I think this section could be entirely removed (or reduced to a
short comment on its potential as a future target).
s section has been moved to the adjuvant section and shortened.
s 221-248. Similarly to the above, mistranslation is interesting for ribosomologists but it is
a significant player in antibiotic therapy and this section should either be removed or
uced to a very short commentary on its potential for use.
ical isolates have been identified that have GatCAB and aaRS mutations. We have
ed this section to emphasize the relevance of this form of resistance by directly
ntioning these.
s 236-239: In addition: This is very unclear to me and needs to be reworded to make the
nded meaning clear. I think that some of the unclearness may come from the introduction of
antibiotic resistance protein’ in the middle of this section.
have modified this section to explicitly name the antibiotic resistance protein (TEM-1)
ier in the paragraph and clarify the intended meaning.
s 272-280: This section about drugs targeting tRNA synthetases is out of place in a
ussion of resistance mechanisms. It should be moved to the New Frontiers in Antibiotic
elopment section. I think that tRNA synthetases as novel drug targets should be discussed
you must be more comprehensive and include the examples of GSK2251052 and the recent
K Tuberculosis tRNA synthetase inhibitors. You should also mention the one that has been
he market for decades - mupirocin.
have removed this section.
New Frontiers in Antibiotic Development section should be expanded. There have been
er developments in translation targeting drugs other than odilorhadbdins. Please examine
literature and especially the Pew Trust database (there are several ahminoglycosides and
acyclines and macrolides designed to overcome resistance mechanisms, for example).
have added the suggested information.
s 331 - 346. It seems wrong to have this long speculation about modification of
ramphenicol while ignoring the actual aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides etc that
in clinical trials or recently approved.
have added the suggested information.
s 347 - 355. Similar criticism to above - this text on modifications of neomycin is speculative
somology rather than a discussion of developments in antibiotic development. In a
review there would be a place for such speculations but not at the expense of ignoring all
he developments that are actually occurring.
have added the suggested information.
s 356 - 365. Same comments as above - you ignore the actual macrolides and ketolides in
elopment and instead return to discussing a potential resistance mechanism.
have added the suggested information.
s 366 - 394. This section is very speculative and it would be better to devote text to actual
mples where an adjuvant has been shown to increase the potency of an antibiotic. There are
lications where adjuvants have for example been used to increase the entry of Gram-
itive antibiotic (macrolides) into Gram-negatives. These have not made it to the clinical yet
I think it would be appropriate to discuss the potential of actual examples like this rather than
ely speculative examples (like mistranslation/kasugomycin and EttA ADP/ATP ratios).
have added additional examples of adjuvants.
s 409 - 416. I don't think the discussion of persisters is relevant to the review and certainly
ot a good way to end the review. Better to end with a summary of the major developments in
g discovery in the area and the problems they are trying to address.
have shortened this part to de-emphasize it.

Line 56, “protein synthesis rapidly halts, leading to elimination of the bug”… how does the
g eliminate? Bacteriostatic vs bactericidal activity, etc. (I also generally object to the use of
term “bug”!)
mination” was referring to the clearance of the pathogen from a host, not necessarily
ng. This sentence has been reworded so it is clearer.
Line 63, “bacteria rapidly evolving mechanisms of resistance”… not clear this entirely true;
stance mechanisms can be acquired by gene transfer and also (as later noted) there is
pelling evidence for the ancient nature of resistance (pre-human use of antibiotics).
s sentence has been modified to include “acquiring and evolving” mechanisms of
stance.
Line 75, specify “bacterial ribosome” (others are not 30S/50S)
have made the suggested change in the text.
Line 77,78 – include inducing miscoding as mechanism of action of aminoglycosides (this is
ntioned later but should be stated here)
have made the suggested change in the text.
Line 82, “Bacteria will often employ inducible methyltransferases”… this is not so clear cut
could be described in a little more detail (how are they inducible, under what circumstances;
g producer vs. acquired resistance enzyme in a pathogen, etc)
have added a more detailed description of the induction further into the paragraph.
Line 86-87, statement that ribosome modification “often” creates a significant impediment
uld be supported by references. Some elaboration may also be needed, e.g. it is not so clear
that this is the case for all aminoglycoside resistance.
have made the suggested change in the text.
Line 133, grammatical issue? (suggest “preventing tetracycline binding and removing drug
e bound”)
have made the suggested change in the text.
Line 156, “directly OR indirectly”
have made the suggested change in the text.
Line 165, mutations in rRNA, protein, both?
have specified ribosomal protein S12.
Line 168, this statement is misleading – EF-Tu hydrolyses GTP regardless of whether
ect codon-anticodon pairing occurs.
have removed the word “correct.”
Line 181, ribosomes are not “permanently” inactivated – competitive inhibitor with a
inant effect due to increased affinity.
have made the suggested change in the text.
Lines 212-220 (discussion of EF-P). Not really clear what the main take-away point is.
e. What is the evidence for high translational demand? Does need to evade immune system
utcompete commensals depend on location/ type of infection/ pathogen? What about
mancy (also an effective strategy to evade antibiotic treatment, also immune system)? Do
mon commensals have EF-P and should this also be a consideration here?
t al. 2019 established that salmonella must quickly undergo proteomic
rogramming to survive in a macrophage. We have modified this section to be more
ar for the reader more precisely reflect this data. We have also addressed the
mancy concern.
Lines 229-239, I also found this description of RpsD mediated effects confusing. In line
why “also” maintains? (Isn’t the discussion about RpsD leading to mistranslation?) And,
ch “antibiotic resistance protein” is referred to in Line 237?
have clarified this section by explicitly naming the antibiotic resistance protein, TEM-
e have also removed the “also” on line 236.
Line 252-253, “non-cognate” is by definition in “the incorrect location”.
have removed the phrase “the incorrect location”
Line 323, while likely true at least in part, interspecies competition is probably not the only
son for bacterial evolution of antibiotics (intra/ interspecies “communication”, regulation of
e expression, etc). The wording here is also a little confusing in terms of natural vs. semi-
thetic antibiotics: Line 324 appears refer to alteration of existing (natural) drugs; additionally,
e is no “this method” described in the preceding sentence and also the next sentence refers
hem as being “isolated” (which suggests the natural compounds themselves). Finally, the
agraph ends with the statement that efforts have turned to chemical modification (which is
re it seemed start…).
have clarified this section.
Line 332, first reference to the figure (despite multiple prior mentions of tRNA binding sites
ther features).
have added more references to the figure 1 and added additional figures.
Line 338, instability of what? The drug itself? (Chemical lability, greater sensitivity to
radation). Is it shown that the alternative site isn’t just less effective for ribosome inhibition?
s was added by mistake and has been removed.
Line 339, “Derivatization of chloramphenicol can also… impact drug activity.” Isn’t this also
case for the previous example? If so, why “also”? (It’s not completely clear but I assume
e “activity” refers to target or mechanism of action? However, even that changed in the
vious example as the ribosome binding site was altered).
have clarified this sentence.
Phrase “Translation is an essential process” is repeated in Line 396 & 403.
removed the first use of this phrase.
