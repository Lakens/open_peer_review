Review of Open Biology Manuscript RSOB-18-0183 by Leila Rieder
Hamm & Harrison: Insights from Drosophila melanogaster: regulatory principles governing the
maternal-to-zygotic transition
Summary:
Hamm and Harrison have written a very comprehensive yet succinct review focusing on MZT in
the Drosophila embryo. They provide comparisons, when available, to other species, and outline
the layers of change--from transcription factors to PTMs to high order genome organization- that
occurs when maternally deposited factors hand off development to the zygotic genome. The
figures are excellently rendered and clear.
Major criticisms:
Consider eliminating passive voice.
One of the goals of the review is to illustrate how the cells of the early embryo achieve
totipotency, however I find this a bit lacking. For example, there is no discussion of the
protamine-to-histone conversion of the male pronucleus. I suggest this as an alternative to the
discussion on SCNT, which I found out of place, or perhaps as a paragraph in the beginning of
section 5.
Consider adding a paragraph about sex determination, since the sex determination cascade
involves zygotic factors and begins in the embryo prior to MZT.
Minor Criticisms:
Please add nuclear cycle numbers to Figure 1A
Please mention the conservation of Staufen (page 4, line 71).
Be specific when writing “transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome,” for example, page 5,
line 115. Is this the earlier wave of activation (NC8) or the major wave (NC14)?
Figure 3B shows Zelda binding to a TAGteam motif that is not nucleosomal--I suggest adding a
nucleosomal motif to the figure.
Typos and Grammar:
Add the word “to” on page 5, line 125.
If convention is not to italicize “Drosophila,” then do not italicize “Xenopus” (page 7, line 230)
Remove “the” from page 7 line 241
Some acronyms do not need to be noted, as they are not used again.
“3D” on page 8, line 272 should be “3B” referring to the figure, or else the statement needs
clarification.
3
“Figure 3C” on page 10 line 374 should be “Figure 3D.”
Add a “.” to page 12 line 468
“Less” on page 6, line 204 should be “fewer.”

The manuscript by Hamm and Harrison describe the molecular mechanisms that underlie the
MZT, with a focus on what we have learned from studies in Drosophila. The review is timely,
readable and comprehensive.
Below are a number of minor points the authors should consider prior to publication.
Minor points:
Inverting the title might make sense (i.e. Regulatory principles governing the maternal-to-zygotic
transition: Insights from Drosophila melanogaster)
While the degradation of maternal mRNAs is thought to be required during the MZT, there is no
evidence that conclusively demonstrates this. The text should be modified to reflect this.
4
Drosophila should be italicized throughout.
Clarify what is meant by ‘division cycle’ in line 24.
For clarity lines 61+62 should be modified to read: ‘including those that regulate the translation,
stability and subcellular localization of mRNAs’.
Lines 65+66 should be modified to read ‘through cis-acting elements within the deposited RNAs’
to reflect the fact that elements can be found in UTRs as well as in orfs.
The sentence in lines 75+76 as worded could be read so as to suggest that polyA tail length is
regulated independent of RBPs, which is in fact likely not the case.
Line 82. SMG regulates both the stability and translation of target mRNAs (i.e. Chen et al., 2014
Genome Biology).
Lines 86+92 should be modified to indicate that there are two ‘general’ pathways of decay to
recognize that there are likely multiple maternal and zygotic pathways.
Lines 99-100. While PUM and BRAT binding sites are largely found in 3’UTRs, SMG sites are
largely located in orfs (see Chen et al., 2014 Genome Biology). In addition, while SMG functions
maternally, BRAT appears to function in both maternal and zygotic pathways (Laver et al, 2015
Genome Biology), while PUM appears to function in zygotic pathways (see Thomsen et a.l, 2010,
Genome Biology and Laver et al., 2015 Genome Biology).
The role of piRNAs in mRNA decay is very controversial, and to avoid the authors having to
delve into this controversy, I suggest that they remove references to this from their manuscript.
Lines 229 and 230: Should this sentence read ‘Increases in expression of Pou5f3, Sox19b, Nanog in
zebrafish and TATA-binding protein in Xenopus contributes to the onset of ZGA in these
species’?
Lines 233-238. Its unclear what the relationship is between genes bound by ZLD and those genes
that required ZLD for their activation. Are the later all direct targets or are some fraction indirect?
Also, where are the binding sites in the targets typically found?
Delete ‘clear’ from line 208.

Hamm & Harrison: Insights from Drosophila melanogaster: regulatory principles governing the maternal-to-zygotic
transition
Summary:
Hamm and Harrison have written a very comprehensive yet succinct review focusing on MZT in the Drosophila embryo.
They provide comparisons, when available, to other species, and outline the layers of change--from transcription factors
to PTMs to high order genome organization- that occurs when maternally deposited factors hand off development to the
zygotic genome. The figures are excellently rendered and clear.
Major criticisms:
Consider eliminating passive voice.
Thank you for this suggestion. We have reviewed the manuscript with this in mind.
One of the goals of the review is to illustrate how the cells of the early embryo achieve totipotency, however I find this a
bit lacking. For example, there is no discussion of the protamine-to-histone conversion of the male pronucleus. I
suggest this as an alternative to the discussion on SCNT, which I found out of place, or perhaps as a paragraph in the
beginning of section 5.
We have added a brief discussion of the histone to protamine exchange at the beginning of this section.
Consider adding a paragraph about sex determination, since the sex determination cascade involves zygotic factors
and begins in the embryo prior to MZT.
We appreciate the importance of sex determination and its establishment in the early embryo. While entire reviews
have been devoted to this process, we have made a brief mention of the fact that genes involved in this pathway and in
early pattering comprise the first group of expressed genes in the early embryo.
Minor Criticisms:
Please add nuclear cycle numbers to Figure 1A
These have been added.
Please mention the conservation of Staufen (page 4, line 71).
We have mentioned that Staufen is conserved, but given the scope of this review have chosen to focus on it’s role in
Drosophila.
Be specific when writing “transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome,” for example, page 5, line 115. Is this the
earlier wave of activation (NC8) or the major wave (NC14)?
For the specific expression of mir-309 the exact timing of expression has not been reported. We have changed the
wording for clarity and looked for additional examples throughout the text where existing data would allow us to be more
precise in our description of gene expression timing.
Figure 3B shows Zelda binding to a TAGteam motif that is not nucleosomal--I suggest adding a nucleosomal motif to
the figure.
While we and Chris Rushlow have unpublished data demonstrating that Zelda can bind to nucleosomal DNA, there are
no published data to warrant inclusion in Figure 3B.
Typos and Grammar:
Add the word “to” on page 5, line 125. Incorporated edit as suggested.
If convention is not to italicize “Drosophila,” then do not italicize “Xenopus” (page 7, line 230) Italicized Drosophila
throughout.
Remove “the” from page 7 line 241 Incorporated edit as suggested.
Some acronyms do not need to be noted, as they are not used again.
“3D” on page 8, line 272 should be “3B” referring to the figure, or else the statement needs clarification. Incorporated
edit as suggested.
“Figure 3C” on page 10 line 374 should be “Figure 3D.” Incorporated edit as suggested.
Add a “.” to page 12 line 468 Incorporated edit as suggested.
“Less” on page 6, line 204 should be “fewer.” Incorporated edit as suggested.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Hamm and Harrison describe the molecular mechanisms that underlie the MZT, with a focus on
what we have learned from studies in Drosophila. The review is timely, readable and comprehensive.
Below are a number of minor points the authors should consider prior to publication.
Minor points:
Inverting the title might make sense (i.e. Regulatory principles governing the maternal-to-zygotic transition: Insights
from Drosophila melanogaster) The title has been inverted, as suggested.
While the degradation of maternal mRNAs is thought to be required during the MZT, there is no evidence that
conclusively demonstrates this. The text should be modified to reflect this.
We have modified the text to reflect the lack of conclusive evidence for the requirement of maternal mRNA
degradation..
Drosophila should be italicized throughout. This is now italicized throughout.
Clarify what is meant by ‘division cycle’ in line 24. Corrected to read, “mitotic division cycle”.
For clarity lines 61+62 should be modified to read: ‘including those that regulate the translation, stability and subcellular
localization of mRNAs’. Thanks for the suggestion. The text has been changed as suggested.
Lines 65+66 should be modified to read ‘through cis-acting elements within the deposited RNAs’ to reflect the fact that
elements can be found in UTRs as well as in orfs. We agree and have changed the text to be more inclusive as
suggested.
The sentence in lines 75+76 as worded could be read so as to suggest that polyA tail length is regulated independent
of RBPs, which is in fact likely not the case. We appreciate pointing out the possible lack of clarity and have attempted
to revise it to be clearer.
Line 82. SMG regulates both the stability and translation of target mRNAs (i.e. Chen et al., 2014 Genome Biology). We
have incorporated and cited work from Chen et al., 2014.
Lines 86+92 should be modified to indicate that there are two ‘general’ pathways of decay to recognize that there are
likely multiple maternal and zygotic pathways. This has been modified.
Lines 99-100. While PUM and BRAT binding sites are largely found in 3’UTRs, SMG sites are largely located in orfs
(see Chen et al., 2014 Genome Biology). In addition, while SMG functions maternally, BRAT appears to function in both
maternal and zygotic pathways (Laver et al, 2015 Genome Biology), while PUM appears to function in zygotic pathways
(see Thomsen et al, 2010, Genome Biology and Laver et al., 2015 Genome Biology). The text has been edited to
include regulation through both 3’UTRs and ORFs.
The role of piRNAs in mRNA decay is very controversial, and to avoid the authors having to delve into this controversy,
I suggest that they remove references to this from their manuscript. We appreciate this suggestion and for this reason
have chosen to keep our mention of this role to a minimum, but provide references. This will allow readers to come to
their own conclusions.
Lines 229 and 230: Should this sentence read ‘Increases in expression of Pou5f3, Sox19b, Nanog in zebrafish and
TATA-binding protein in Xenopus contributes to the onset of ZGA in these species’? These changes have been made.
Lines 233-238. Its unclear what the relationship is between genes bound by ZLD and those genes that required ZLD for
their activation. Are the later all direct targets or are some fraction indirect? Also, where are the binding sites in the
targets typically found?
We have added a discussion to clarify the relationship between ZLD-bound loci and gene expression.
Delete ‘clear’ from line 208. Modified line 308.
