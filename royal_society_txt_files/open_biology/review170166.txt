m6A is the most well characterized epitranscriptomic mark in the mammalian systems and
impacts many different functions of RNA biology. However, no previous study has ever
examined its distribution and regulation in the brain, where it is of high abundance. In this study,
Chang et al reports the first transcriptome-wide methylation profile of m6A in mouse brain,
demonstrating region-specific methylation, the existence of the heterogeneity of RNA
methylation across different brain regions and different types of neural cells. Most interestingly,
the discovery of the high m6A methylation levels of FMRP target mRNAs suggests a possible
function of m6A in synapse and disease. In general, the data is well interpreted and the
manuscript presents a clear and interesting story. I recommend the publication of this work in
Open Biology after minor revision:
1. In page 12, the logic of this paragragh is a little disordered. It will be better to firstly
introduce the term of numbers of mRNA peaks and genes, then introduce the term of fold
enrichment of peaks and genes instead of the mixture and crossing of the two terms.
2. Also in page 12 line 245-247, “the number of specifically methylated mRNAs (SMRs) was
much higher including 1559 cerebellar SMRs and 712 cortical SMRs” should be revised to “the
number of specifically methylated mRNAs (SMRs) was much higher in cerebellar SMRs(1559)
than in cortical SMRs(712)”.
3. In figure 2h-i, the largely different numbers of “common” and “specific” may generate
difference when calculating the difference of fold enrichment between the two parts, so the
similar numbers of input is suggested to be put to calculate the difference of fold enrichment
between the two parts.
4. In figure 3a, when calculating the motif of the m6A, the distance of the upstream and
downstream of the m6A between the two samples (cerebellum and cortex) is different, I mean it
should be consistent when calculating the motif of the two samples, including the length and the
up-down stream distance between the modification sites. In this figure, we don’t know the base
at the +2 site of the cortex.
5. In page 16 line 330, it is mentioned that “identified 814, 704 and 1,436 genes with
detectable methylation levels in three types of cells in cerebellum”. Do the authors know (or can
you estimate based on literature) the proportions of the three cells? The difference of methylated
genes and levels between these three cells could be influenced by the difference of the numbers of
cells, as shown in figure 4a b c. The authors may want to change the wording a bit.

In this manuscript, Chang et al investigated the m6A profiles in different mouse brain regions
and illustrated common and region-specific mRNA targets. In-depth data analysis revealed an
interesting correlation between methylated mRNAs and FMRP targets. In addition, the start
codon-associated m6A is intriguing and implies a novel regulation in neuron development.
Recent years have witnessed stunning progress on “epitranscriptomcs”, which triggered a flurry
of studies aimed at functional characterization of mRNA m6A modification. The study by Chang
et al yields timely and useful information by focusing on brain region-specific m6A. It has long
been appreciated that brain tissue is subject to m6A regulation. However, the relevant studies
lagged behind partly due to the technical challenge. The authors had nicely performed brain
tissue isolation, which is key to the success of mapping region-specific m6A profiles. As a result,
the study revealed several interesting findings, which lay a foundation for future mechanistic
investigations. The manuscript was clearly written, the data is of high quality, and the reference
is up-to-date. Except for a few minor concerns, I highly recommend publication of this
manuscript at Open Biology.
Minor comments:
1. The figure legend of Fig. 6c is unclear. Does the orange bar refer to unmethylated FMRP
targets? It will be more informative to see the relative distance between m6A peaks and FMRP
binding sites. Zero distance will support the model depicted in Fig. 6f.
2. Page 22, is there any evidence showing that the target mRNAs are demethylated upon
synaptic stimuli?
3. The overlap between m6A and FMRP targets is intriguing. Phenotypically, does
overexpression of m6A demethylases (e.g., FTO or ALKBH5) potentially mimic the FMRP
disease? A clearer discussion will be desirable.

Comments to the Author(s)
m6A is the most well characterized epitranscriptomic mark in the mammalian systems and impacts
many different functions of RNA biology. However, no previous study has ever examined its
distribution and regulation in the brain, where it is of high abundance. In this study, Chang et al
reports the first transcriptome-wide methylation profile of m6A in mouse brain, demonstrating
region-specific methylation, the existence of the heterogeneity of RNA methylation across different
brain regions and different types of neural cells. Most interestingly, the discovery of the high m6A
methylation levels of FMRP target mRNAs suggests a possible function of m6A in synapse and
disease. In general, the data is well interpreted and the manuscript presents a clear and interesting
story. I recommend the publication of this work in Open Biology after minor revision:
1. In page 12, the logic of this paragraph is a little disordered. It will be better to firstly introduce
the term of numbers of mRNA peaks and genes, then introduce the term of fold enrichment of
peaks and genes instead of the mixture and crossing of the two terms.
Answer: We thank this reviewer’s constructive comment. In the revised manuscript (Page 12, Line
243-265), we have modified text according to the suggestion.
2. Also in page 12 line 245-247, “the number of specifically methylated mRNAs (SMRs) was
much higher including 1559 cerebellar SMRs and 712 cortical SMRs” should be revised to “the
number of specifically methylated mRNAs (SMRs) was much higher in cerebellar SMRs (1559) than
in cortical SMRs (712)”.
Answer: Thanks for this reviewer’s suggestions to make more clear presentation. We have made
revision according to your suggestion (Page 12, Line 246-250).
3. In figure 2h-i, the largely different numbers of “common” and “specific” may generate
difference when calculating the difference of fold enrichment between the two parts, so the similar
numbers of input is suggested to be put to calculate the difference of fold enrichment between the
two parts.
Answer: We thank this reviewer for the constructive comments. We have added one
supplementary figure to address this question. From the commonly methylated RNAs, we
randomly extracted the same numbers of m6A peaks or methylated RNAs as specifically methylated
RNAs, and then compared for their methylation levels. In total, 10 sets of commonly methylated
RNAs were extracted and compared. Same result was obtained that commonly methylated RNAs
had higher methylation levels than specifically methylated RNAs. This result was shown in
Supplementary Figure S2g & S2h. We included this result in page 13, line 261-265.
4. In figure 3a, when calculating the motif of the m6A, the distance of the upstream and
downstream of the m6A between the two samples (cerebellum and cortex) is different, I mean it
should be consistent when calculating the motif of the two samples, including the length and the
up-downstream distance between the modification sites. In this figure, we don’t know the base
at the +2 site of the cortex.
Answer: We thank this reviewer for his comments. The motif shown in previous version was an
output generated automatically by using HOMER software, when the length of motif was set as
5nt. Judged from the results from several groups and ours (Ref. 10, 12 & 62), the distance of the
upstream and downstream of the m6A was not always the same. In order to know the base at the
+2 site of the cortex, we re-analyzed the motif by setting the parameter of motif length as 6nt and
7 nt, and observed similar motifs in both cerebellum and cortex. The most conserved base at the
+2 site in both samples was U. This result was added as a supplementary figure S6c, S6d.
5. In page 16 line 330, it is mentioned that “identified 814, 704 and 1,436 genes with detectable
methylation levels in three types of cells in cerebellum”. Do the authors know (or can you estimate
based on literature) the proportions of the three cells? The difference of methylated genes and
levels between these three cells could be influenced by the difference of the numbers of cells, as
shown in figure 4a b c. The authors may want to change the wording a bit.
Answer: We thank this reviewer for the suggestions. Based on literature research, in mouse
cerebellar cortex, the granular cells account for ~85%, astrocytes account for ~15%, while Purkinje
cells account for 0.2% only (Ref. 7). However, we don’t think that the difference of methylated
genes and levels could be influenced by the different cells numbers, because we did not perform
m6A-IP directly using the specified type of neural cells. Instead, we took advantage of the result of
TRAP-seq of adult mouse cerebellum (Ref. 68). They generated Pcp2, Neurod1 and Sept4 bacTRAP
animals which were utilized to purify Purkinje cells, granular cells and Bergmann glial cells
respectively. Four cerebella were used for cells isolation and RNA purification, followed by TRAP-
seq which only needed 10 ng of total RNA for cDNA library construction. By comparing the RNA
expression among the three types of cells, they identified cell-type enriched RNAs, including 922
Purkinje cell-, 2084 Bergmann glia-, and 986 granular neuron-enriched genes. Therefore, what we
analyzed in this study were the methylation levels of these cell-type enriched RNAs, but not all the
RNAs isolated from one type of neural cells. In order to make this point easier to be understood,
we have made some revision on page 16, Line 340-356.

In this manuscript, Chang et al investigated the m6A profiles in different mouse brain regions and

The manuscript was clearly written, the data is of high quality, and the reference is up-to-date.
Except for a few minor concerns, I highly recommend publication of this manuscript at Open
Biology.
Minor comments:
1. The figure legend of Fig. 6c is unclear. Does the orange bar refer to unmethylated FMRP targets?
It will be more informative to see the relative distance between m6A peaks and FMRP binding sites.
Zero distance will support the model depicted in Fig. 6f.
Answer: We thank this reviewer for the constructive suggestion. Yes, the orange bar refers to
unmethylated FMRP targets. We have modified the figure legend in order to make it easier to be
understood (Page 36-37, Line 914-915). Our finding of the correlation between FMRP and m6A was
drawn mainly based on data mining including the previous CLIP by others and our m6A-seq. Data
analysis from several independent studies revealed that the consensus motif of FMRP binding sites
include GAC, GGA and ACU, which are highly similar to m6A motif. We do agree that it will be more
informative to see the relative distance between m6A peaks and FMRP binding sites. Currently we
have initiated another project to investigate whether FMRP is a direct m6A reader or not, by
utilizing in vivo FMRP CLIP and miCLIP (Ref. 66). In this manuscript, we changed the wording a bit
in order to avoid overstatement (page 23, line 484-491).
2. Page 22, is there any evidence showing that the target mRNAs are demethylated upon
synaptic stimuli?
Answer: We thank this reviewer for the question. To our knowledge, there is no published data
showing that the target mRNAs are demethylated upon synaptic stimuli under normal physiological
condition. However, under pathophysiological conditions, fear conditioning exposure caused an
increase of m6A in mouse prefrontal cortex (Ref. 34) and hippocampus (Ref. 89). On the other side,
in addition to demethylation, either increase or decrease in RNA methylation level caused by
altered expression of writer and reader genes may also be able to interfere the FMRP-RNA protein
interaction. Thus, in the revised manuscript, we changed the wording in the manuscript for an
objective judgement (Page 22. Line 491-506).
3. The overlap between m6A and FMRP targets is intriguing. Phenotypically, does
overexpression of m6A demethylases (e.g., FTO or ALKBH5) potentially mimic the FMRP disease?
A clearer discussion will be desirable.
Answer: We thank this reviewer for his invaluable question. Indeed, this is a very important
question to address. There is no published data yet showing that the overexpression of m6A
demethylases potentially mimics the FMRP diseases. We have performed in vivo transient
overexpression of FTO in mouse cerebellum by using lentivirus system. We observed the defect in
cerebellum development, but we could not conclude that it mimics the FMRP disease, since FTO
was overexpressed only in very limited area in the mouse brain. However, Fto genetic variants have
been found to be correlate with high risk of Alzheimer diseases (Ref. 91 & 92). Meanwhile, an
Alkbh5 SNP was also found in the major depressive disorder patients (Ref. 90). These results imply
that m6A RNA methylation may play a role in synaptic signaling and intellectual disability.
Additionally, alteration in mRNA methylation, either increase or decrease, may be able to interfere
the FMRP-RNA interaction as well. Therefore, there is a possibility that other m6A-related genes
are also contribute to cognitive disorders. We have revised the manuscript as shown on Page 23,
line 507-524.
