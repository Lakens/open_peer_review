This is an excellent and timely review that covers findings over recent years in the roles of the
principal Polo-like kinase in mitotic entry. The review is very clearly written and is a delight to
read.
I do not see any need to revise any of the text as presented. However, the authors might wish to
consider including some description of an aspect of mitotic entry in which the role of Polo is not
absolutely clear. This relates to the mitotic kinase Greatwall that is required to inhibit indirectly
PP2A:B55 to promote mitotic entry. As greatwall has been shown to have genetic interactions
with polo in Drosophila, it might be worthwhile mentioning this as an area still requiring study
as, to my knowledge, the biochemical interpretation of this interaction is still not clear.
I strongly support publication of this interesting review

This is a very nice review describing how polo kinase (PLK1) is regulated during mitotic entry, a
manuscript of a great interest accessible for non-expert people.
specific comments
Page 2
Lane 24 & 25
Drosophila Polo, mammalian Plk1, Xenopus Plx1 and C. elegans PLK-1 are clear orthologs at the
sequence and functional levels (here, we refer to them collectively as Polo)
I found confusing to refer all 4 kinases as Polo as – you don’t really use only the name Polo …
Also it is much easier to follow if you use the right names, Plk1, Plx1, PLK-1, Cdc25, Polo
Or do as for yeast
…. inactivation of Cdc5 (Polo) kinase ….
Two examples of confusing sentences
1 - These phenotypes could have been due to incomplete inactivation of Plk1 in these tissues,
where maternally contributed Polo is gradually depleted in the developing fly.
Here Plk1 should be Polo (because it is Drosophila)
2 - Consistent with a role for Polo in mitotic entry, inactivation of Plk1 (Polo) by antibody
injection in non-transformed human cells caused a majority of cells to arrest in the G2 phase of
the cell cycle (Lane and Nigg, 1996).
Etc …

I thought that Aurora-A activated PLK1 at centrosome (Macurek et al., 2008; Seki et al., 2008;
Thomas 91 et al., 2016).
while Aurora-B activated PLK1 at kinetochores (Carmena et al., 2012).
And I know that it has been shown only in Drosophila.
This has to be discussed further.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
5
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

AUTHORS RESPONSE: We have defined and used Polo as a generic name for
cross-species direct orthologs in an effort to make the text easier to read. The
reviewer’s suggestion prompted us to try again writing without it, always
using all species-specific names of Polo orthologs in all sentences. We found
that this complicates the text unnecessarily and therefore we would like to
keep our original approach. However, we did correct a few instances,
including those mentioned by the reviewer, where the names were misused
or sentences were unclear.

Seki et al., 2008; Thomas 91 et al., 2016).
while Aurora-B activated PLK1 at kinetochores (Carmena et al., 2012).
And I know that it has been shown only in Drosophila.
This has to be discussed further.
AUTHORS RESPONSE: We have discussed these points in the sentences
below:
“Phosphorylation at this residue is primarily mediated by Aurora A in
vertebrates (Figure, point 3) (Macurek et al., 2008; Seki et al., 2008; Thomas
et al., 2016) and possibly also in C. elegans (Tavernier et al., 2015b), and by
Aurora B in Drosophila (Carmena et al., 2012). Aurora A is enriched at spindle
2
poles, and phosphorylated Plk1 is first detected at centrosomes as human cells
enter mitosis (Bruinsma et al., 2012).”
We cannot state that Aurora A activates Plk1 at centrosomes because,
although it is likely the case, it has not been formally shown.
Aside from addressing the reviewers’ suggestions, we have added a
paragraph to discuss a newly published article that shows a role for WAC and
Aurora A in promoting Plk1 activation in the nucleus.
We sincerely thank you and the reviewers for the help in improving our
review article.
Best wishes,
Vince and Lionel
