Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
This study reviewed the mechanotransduction in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells from various
aspects, such as cell proliferation, cell-substrate adhesion, bone remodeling, stem cell
differentiation, matrix rigidity, and periodontal disease. The paper appeared well-written, but on
the basic point, the reviewer got the impression that authors didn’t fully understand the biology
of periodontium throughout the text, e.g. PDL tissue doesn’t include keratinocyres, gum tissues
and PDL tissues were mixedly explained, and another end of Sharpey’s fiber is also embedded in
alveolar bone, and so on.
Other comments
1. Regarding the abbreviation of PDL, authors described periodontal ligament as PDL in p4, line
4, but PDLs meant periodontal ligament cells in p5, line 12.
2. P5, line 12, how did authors distinguish PDL cells from PDLFs?
3. P11, lines 2-4, it was difficult for the reviewer to understand this sentence ‘Cell shape has been
shown to regulate……’. How does cell shape regulate them? Cell shape is the state of some
affairs.
4. As some contents are repeated and others are complicated, authors should summarize in Table,
or show the scheme.
5. P9, line 18, ‘is’ should be probably deleted.

This study reviewed the mechanotransduction in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells from various
aspects, such as cell proliferation, cell-substrate adhesion, bone remodeling, stem cell
differentiation, matrix rigidity, and periodontal disease. The paper appeared well-written, but on
the basic point, the reviewer got the impression that authors didn't fully understand the biology
of periodontium throughout the text, e.g. PDL tissue doesn't include keratinocyres, gum tissues
and PDL tissues were mixedly explained, and another end of Sharpey's fiber is also embedded in
alveolar bone, and so on.
Response: We have deleted all occurrences of ‘keratinocytes’ from the manuscript. We have
deleted the one occurrence of the word ‘gum tissue’. We have fixed the error regarding Sharpey’s
fiber which is indeed embedded in alveolar bone at one end and cementum at the other.
Other comments
1. Regarding the abbreviation of PDL, authors described periodontal ligament as PDL in p4, line
4, but PDLs meant periodontal ligament cells in p5, line 12.
Response: We have corrected this error. Periodontal ligament cells are now referred to as PDL
cells.
2. P5, line 12, how did authors distinguish PDL cells from PDLFs?
Response: PDL fibroblasts are variously referred to as PDL cells and PDLFs in the literature.
Because this seems to have caused confusion, we have deleted the sentences on P5, line 12.
3. P11, lines 2-4, it was difficult for the reviewer to understand this sentence 'Cell shape has been
shown to regulate..'. How does cell shape regulate them? Cell shape is the state of some affairs.
Response: Cell shape can be ‘controlled’ by patterning extracellular matrix adhesion proteins. In
this case, cell shape is a parameter that can be tuned independently of the soluble environment of
growth factors. The cited paper (117) is one of the most popular papers in the literature published
in Science and with more than 5000 citations so far. Therefore, that cell shape has been shown to
regulate cell function is a well-established concept in the field, due in particular to the work of
Don Ingber and coworkers.
4. As some contents are repeated and others are complicated, authors should summarize in Table,
or show the scheme.
Response: We considered preparing a table of some sort in the original submission, but the table
became too verbose to be of significant value to the manuscript. We are happy to prepare a table
if the referee has more specific suggestions.
5. P9, line 18, 'is' should be probably deleted.
Response: This has now been fixed. Thank you.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_4
The authors demonstrated the effects of mechanical force to periodontal ligament-derived cells
including stem cells. The present article has importance because reviewing the relationship
between periodontal ligament-derived cells and mechanical force is crucial to understand the
healing process under the mechanical force like mastication. Some comments are shown below.
Major comments
1. There are the same sentence in the abstract and the introduction. The authors should not use
the same sentence in the article.
2. The authors used abbreviation for many words, however they did not need to use abbreviation
when they use the word once (ROCK, FAK etc.). They should check abbreviations used in this
article carefully.
3. What does the bone inhibitory protein mean? Is it a correct name for classification of protein?
In addition, slerostin should be wrong and sclerostin is correct.
4. The author demonstrated that osteogenesis in PDLs has been observed under fluid shear and
6
under centrifugal force, however the results from reference No 88 and 89 used not PDL tissues
but PDL cells. The author should check their results again.
Minor comments;
1. P1 The authors should set the affiliation that comes out first to ‘a, b’.
2. In the abstract part, the authors demonstrated that PDL tissue includes stem cells, fibroblasts,
and epithelial cells. However, PDL tissue is known to include other types of cells such as
cementoblasts and osteoblasts, so they should reveal the cells in PDL tissue in detail.
3. In the abstract part, the authors described the mechanical stresses generated by chewing
motion, tongue motions, and implants. They also show the effects of the orthodontic force on
PDL cells, so they should add the orthodontic force in this sentence.
4. P3 A period is essential after the sentence, The human periodontium is a structure that
supports and anchors teeth to marginal gingiva and to alveolar bone.
5. P3 ,a loss of equilibrium, is better.
6. The author used PD as an abbreviation of periodontal disease, however many ‘periodontal
disease’ remains. They should identify PD at first and use it as a substitute of periodontal disease.
Same as periodontal disease, the author should check the word, periodontal ligament.
7. The author should not use the number at the beginning of the sentence.
8. P5 such strain; is better.
9. P6 The authors need to (MMP) after the word, matrix metalloproteinease. In addition, they put
hyphen between MMP and number or not, so they should be consistent with the terms used in
the document.
10. P6 The authors should insert a space before %.
11. P6 The authors used collagen-1 and type I collagen, so they should be consistent with the
terms used in the document.
12. P8 PDL tissue does not produce IL-1b and the cells included in PDL tissue produce it.
13. P8 tensile strain and fluid shear is better.
14. P8 Pulp is not periodontium, so I recommend to remove the sentence, Uniaxial strain applied
to dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) inhibits osteogenic differentiation
15. P9 Periodontal fibroblast should be changed to PDLF.
16. P10 The word, 2001, should be removed.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
The authors demonstrated the effects of mechanical force to periodontal
ligament-derived cells including stem cells. The present article has
importance because reviewing the relationship between periodontal ligament-
derived cells and mechanical force is crucial to understand the healing
process under the mechanical force like mastication. Some comments are
shown below.
Major comments
1. There are the same sentence in the abstract and the introduction. The
authors should not use the same sentence in the article.
Response: We assume the reviewer is referring to the sentence, “These
cells are constantly exposed to mechanical stresses2 generated by biological
process like the chewing motions of teeth3, by flows generated by tongue
motions4, and by orthodontic forces generated by implants” We thank the
reviewer for the suggestion but the reason the sentence is repeated in the
introduction is because we wish to provide citations to it, which we cannot do
in the abstract. We have now modified the sentence somewhat.
2. The authors used abbreviation for many words, however they did not need
to use abbreviation when they use the word once (ROCK, FAK etc.). They
should check abbreviations used in this article carefully.
Response: We have checked the all the abbreviations used and deleted
those that were used only once .
3. What does the bone inhibitory protein mean? Is it a correct name for
classification of protein? In addition, slerostin should be wrong and sclerostin
is correct.
Response: We meant that sclerostin is a negative regulator of bone
formation. We have now deleted these words, and corrected the typo.
4. The author demonstrated that osteogenesis in PDLs has been observed
under fluid shear and under centrifugal force, however the results from
reference No 88 and 89 used not PDL tissues but PDL cells. The author
should check their results again.
Response: We have added the word ‘cells’ after the word ‘PDL’ to clarify that
cells and not tissues were studied in reference 88 and 89.
Minor comments;
1. P1 The authors should set the affiliation that comes out first to ‘a, b’.
Response: We have made changes to the affiliations as suggested by the
reviewer.
2. In the abstract part, the authors demonstrated that PDL tissue
includes stem cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. However, PDL
tissue is known to include other types of cells such as cementoblasts
and osteoblasts, so they should reveal the cells in PDL tissue in
detail.
Response: We agree PDL tissue includes “various cell types” as
mentioned in the abstract. The focus of this review is
mechanotransduction, and we couldn’t find papers dealing specifically
with mechanotransduction by cementoblasts in the PDL or
osteoblasts *in the PDL*.
3. In the abstract part, the authors described the mechanical stresses
generated by chewing motion, tongue motions, and implants. They
also show the effects of the orthodontic force on PDL cells, so they
should add the orthodontic force in this sentence.
Response: We now mention orthodontic forces in the introduction.
4.P3 A period is essential after the sentence, The human periodontium is a
structure that supports and anchors teeth to marginal gingiva and to alveolar
bone.
Response: That has now been fixed.
5.P3 ,a loss of equilibrium, is better.
Response: We have made the change suggested.
6.The author used PD as an abbreviation of periodontal disease, however
many ‘periodontal disease’ remains. They should identify PD at first and use
it as a substitute of periodontal disease. Same as periodontal disease, the
author should check the word, periodontal ligament.
Response: We have eliminated the words periodontal disease and
periodontal ligament after their abbreviations are defined.
7.The author should not use the number at the beginning of the sentence.
Response: We have changed 70.1 % to seventy percent.
8.P5 such strain; is better.
Response: We have made the change.
9. P6 The authors need to (MMP) after the word, matrix metalloproteinease.
In addition, they put hyphen between MMP and number or not, so they
should be consistent with the terms used in the document.
Response: We have made the changes suggested.
10. P6 The authors should insert a space before %.
Response: done.
11. P6 The authors used collagen-1 and type I collagen, so they should be
consistent with the terms used in the document.
Response: Done.
12. P8 PDL tissue does not produce IL-1b and the cells included in PDL
tissue produce it.
Response: We have added the word ‘cells’ after the word ‘PDL’.
13. P8 tensile strain and fluid shear is better.
Response: We have made the changes as suggested by the reviewer.
14. P8 Pulp is not periodontium, so I recommend to remove the sentence,
Uniaxial strain applied to dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) inhibits osteogenic
differentiation
Response: We removed this sentence.
15. P9 Periodontal fibroblast should be changed to PDLF.
Response: Fixed.
16. P10 The word, 2001, should be removed.
Response: We have made the change as suggested.
