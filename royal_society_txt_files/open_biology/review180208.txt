Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In the review by Sun, Xiao, and Carlson, the authors tackle Odorant Binding Proteins (OBPs)- a
class of molecules highly enriched in olfactory tissues, but whose functions are poorly
understood. The goal of the review is to summarize what is currently known about OBPs,
highlighting recent discoveries made by the authors in Drosophila.
A review about OBPs is timely, given the new discoveries by the Carlson lab. It is useful to
revisit OBPs in light of these new discoveries. While I am in favor of the review, I think the
authors could dig a little deeper in discussing OBPs. I find reviews most useful when they are a
synthesis of knowledge from experts in the field; a way to gain insight into a topic from those
who have thought long and hard about it. As it is now, the review is mainly cursory, lightly
touching upon different topics associated with OBPs. For example, after reading the review, I was
still left slightly confused as to what OBPs actually do, which is essentially how I felt before
reading the review. As such, it would be helpful (and an opportunity for the authors) to reflect
upon the author’s current models/thinking for OBPs. How might a beginning graduate student
think about this curious class of molecules? I describe sections that could be improved, which
might help the authors enrich the review, and make it more impactful.
1. Question. If OBPs can bind many odorants (chemicals?) in vitro assays, can these studies be
used to determine if the chemical binding is relevant? Do the authors have recommendations on
how to interpret such results?
2. OBPs appear to have diverse functions, likely far beyond binding odorants. Should they be
renamed? Does classifying them as odorant binding proteins hinder investigations into their
function? Are they enriched in other tissues?
3. It would be interesting to include a phylogenetic tree for OBPs (for the OBPs in Drosophila,
and include OBPs from other insects if possible), and then highlight which OBPs have known in
vivo functions (ie, LUSH for cVA pheromone binding, OBP28a as quencher, OBP59a as humidity
sensor). Would this reveal that there are sub-families? That some OBPs might be pheromone
binding proteins (as previously implicated), others more similar to OBP59a may act to interact
with non-odorants, etc? Do the authors think that OBPs as a whole might be better classified into
smaller protein families? If so, what should be the classifications?
4. The potential function of OBPs in non-model insects could be expanded. For example, ticks do
not contain ORCO/Ors but do contain OBPs. It is suspected that OBPs might act directly in
odorant detection (see work by Roe and Soneshine). The author’s insights on this would be of
value. In addition, OBP1 is suspected to play a large role in odorant and repellent detection in
3
mosquitoes (see: Biessmann Plos one 2010, Qiao Cell Mol Life Sci 2010, Tsitsanou Cell Mol Life
Sciences 2011, among others).
5. Section 2 of the review. Please clarify how OBPs are classified from an insect’s genome (ie,
Agam has 69, cockroach has 109). If they are diverse in sequence, what hallmarks are used to
determine if a protein is an OBP? Could this classification be too broad?
6. Figure 2. Please point out the three disulfide bridges on the crystal structure. As these bridges
are a hallmark of an OBP, it will be useful to see them presented in the structure.
Similarly, please label the 6 alpha-helices in the crystal structure (e.g., different shades of color, or
by numbers). If one can’t see all 6 helices in a single view, maybe include an image of it rotated
90°.
7. The crystal structure of Agam OBP1 is hypothesized to be a dimer (Fig 3 in Tsitsanou 2012).
How does this relate to the crystal structure shown by the authors in Fig 2? Can OBPs function as
both monomers and dimers?
8. Figure 4. Perhaps shade the lymph region to emphasize that it represents an aqueous region.
9. Are there any general principles for the types of chemicals that OBPs tend to bind? If binding
is verified, is it usually to fatty lipids like cuticular pheromones? Mostly hydrophobic chemicals?
Have in vitro studies similarly generated the types of chemicals that can be bound to OBPs? Or
those that would not be bound?
10. What are the ‘tuning’ properties of OBPs? Do they tend to bind to certain classes of
molecules? Do they tend to be narrowly or broadly tuned?
11. It would be of value if the authors commented on what they view as the future of OBP
research. Do the authors think OBPS will be involved in even more functions? If so, what? What
is the best way forward? Should efforts be spent performing in vitro binding assays? Or instead
on in vivo studies? Would exogenous expression screens be of value? Or only knock-out
studies?

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
The authors have provided a concise review of the insect OBPs, showing how several studies,
most decisively from their lab, reveal that the now-standard supposition about their function
(transport of hydrophobic ligands from the air to the odorant receptors), is unlikely to be their
primary role.
The review is well written and in my opinion describes well the state of the field, which these
authors and a few others have recently questioned with strong datasets. As they note, there are
innumerable studies of OBPs in insects, their diversity, expression, and ligand-binding, but
almost no decisive studies of their function based on the gold standard of knocking out the gene
encoding the OBP. In part this is because until very recently this was difficult to do in non-
Drosophila insects, hence their and other studies on Drosophila OBP mutants are so critical. This
review will go a long way to pushing others in this field to take a more critical view of OBP
function, and hopefully will recruit some outside the immediate field to study these abundant,
diverse, and clearly very interesting but mostly enigmatic proteins.
I only have a few suggestions for improvement.
First, in the title and the first sentence of the abstract, I encourage the authors to include the word
"insect", both to avoid confusion with the mammalian OBPs (which, as they note, are completely
different proteins), and any other animals with OBP-like proteins, as with a few unclear
exceptions, so far OBPs have only been found in insects and their closest relatives, other
hexapods.
Second, I think the authors could include reference to the Gomez-Diaz et al paper from 2013 in
PLoS Biology on the role of Obp67d in cVA perception in Drosophila showing that the model of
OBP configuration changing upon ligand binding and this change affecting the relevant OR is not
correct (something mentioned briefly in line109).

Editor
Open Biology
Dear Editor,
We are very grateful to the reviewers for their helpful comments, which we
have addressed as follows:
Reviewer 1
1. Question. If OBPs can bind many odorants (chemicals?) in vitro assays,
can these studies be used to determine if the chemical binding is relevant? Do
the authors have recommendations on how to interpret such results?
--We have added to the ms. a statement that "binding affinities in vitro
may not always reflect binding affinities in vivo, where conditions may differ.
In vitro studies are extremely useful in making predictions about Obp function
in vivo, but these predictions need to be tested."
2. OBPs appear to have diverse functions, likely far beyond binding odorants.
Should they be renamed? Does classifying them as odorant binding proteins
hinder investigations into their function? Are they enriched in other tissues?
--We think it would be better to rename Obps after we know more
about their functions. We have added a statement that "In fact, recent
RNAseq data in Drosophila has revealed expression of more than 25 Obps in
tissues outside the olfactory organs of the fly."
3. It would be interesting to include a phylogenetic tree for OBPs (for the
OBPs in Drosophila, and include OBPs from other insects if possible), and
then highlight which OBPs have known in vivo functions (ie, LUSH for cVA
pheromone binding, OBP28a as quencher, OBP59a as humidity sensor).
Would this reveal that there are sub-families? That some OBPs might be
pheromone binding proteins (as previously implicated), others more similar to
OBP59a may act to interact with non-odorants, etc? Do the authors think
that OBPs as a whole might be better classified into smaller protein families?
If so, what should be the classifications?
--We have examined a published phylogenetic tree of Obps and have
not found a compelling relationship between position on the tree and function,
nor a compelling reason to reclassify them. We have, however, added a
statement that the tree includes not only classical Obps but also ones with
more or fewer cysteine residues.
4. The potential function of OBPs in non-model insects could be expanded.
For example, ticks do not contain ORCO/Ors but do contain OBPs. It is
suspected that OBPs might act directly in odorant detection (see work by Roe
and Soneshine). The author’s insights on this would be of value. In
addition, OBP1 is suspected to play a large role in odorant and repellent
detection in mosquitoes (see: Biessmann Plos one 2010, Qiao Cell Mol Life
Sci 2010, Tsitsanou Cell Mol Life Sciences 2011, among others).
--We consider the identification of Obp-like proteins in ticks to be
tentative and prefer not to emphasize them. However, the revised ms.
contains a reference to Biessman PLoS One 2010.
5. Section 2 of the review. Please clarify how OBPs are classified from an
insect’s genome (ie, Agam has 69, cockroach has 109). If they are diverse in
sequence, what hallmarks are used to determine if a protein is an OBP?
Could this classification be too broad?
--We have explained how the 109 Obps were identified and
acknowledged that these numbers include some variants of the canonical
structure. We have also indicated that the abundantly expressed antennal
Obps are all of the classical structure.
6. Figure 2. Please point out the three disulfide bridges on the crystal
structure. As these bridges are a hallmark of an OBP, it will be useful to see
them presented in the structure.
Similarly, please label the 6 alpha-helices in the crystal structure (e.g.,
different shades of color, or by numbers). If one can’t see all 6 helices in a
single view, maybe include an image of it rotated 90°.
--We have replaced the original figure with a figure that shows the
disulfide bridges and that labels the 6 alpha-helices.
7. The crystal structure of Agam OBP1 is hypothesized to be a dimer (Fig 3
in Tsitsanou 2012). How does this relate to the crystal structure shown by
the authors in Fig 2? Can OBPs function as both monomers and dimers?
--We have added a statement indicating that "Crystallized Obps have
revealed a dimeric structure with a binding pocket that consists of a tunnel
extending into each of the two subunits (Leite 2009, Wogulis 2006)".
8. Figure 4. Perhaps shade the lymph region to emphasize that it represents
an aqueous region.
--Amended as suggested; we thank the reviewer for this excellent
suggestion.
9. Are there any general principles for the types of chemicals that OBPs tend
to bind? If binding is verified, is it usually to fatty lipids like cuticular
pheromones? Mostly hydrophobic chemicals? Have in vitro studies similarly
generated the types of chemicals that can be bound to OBPs? Or those that
would not be bound?
--We have added a statement indicating that "Most Obps bind
hydrophobic compounds (Pelosi CMLS 06)"
10. What are the ‘tuning’ properties of OBPs? Do they tend to bind to
certain classes of molecules? Do they tend to be narrowly or broadly tuned?
--We have added a statement that "some appear to bind a broad
spectrum of hydrophobic ligands (Li PLOS One 16)."
11. It would be of value if the authors commented on what they view as the
future of OBP research. Do the authors think OBPS will be involved in even
more functions? If so, what? What is the best way forward? Should efforts be
spent performing in vitro binding assays? Or instead on in vivo studies?
Would exogenous expression screens be of value? Or only knock-out
studies?
--We have rewritten the last section of the paper to provide a more
explicit vision of a future for the field. The revised section reflects our view
that more functions will be found, and that in vivo analysis is the most
promising path forward. We suggest both physiological and anatomical
avenues for research.

1. First, in the title and the first sentence of the abstract, I encourage the
authors to include the word "insect", both to avoid confusion with the
mammalian OBPs (which, as they note, are completely different proteins), and
any other animals with OBP-like proteins, as with a few unclear exceptions,
so far OBPs have only been found in insects and their closest relatives, other
hexapods.
--We have added the word "insect" to the first sentence of the
Abstract.
2. Second, I think the authors could include reference to the Gomez-Diaz et al
paper from 2013 in PLoS Biology on the role of Obp67d in cVA perception in
Drosophila showing that the model of OBP configuration changing upon
ligand binding and this change affecting the relevant OR is not correct
(something mentioned briefly in line109).
--The original version of our ms. was not clear in line 109. Gomez-
Diaz refuted a model from Dean Smith's lab in which odor receptor Or67d is
activated directly by an Obp bound to cVA. In line 109 we were referring to a
model of Walter Leal in which other Obps change configuration due to
interaction with a charged membrane. We have reworded this line to make
our intent clearer.
Thanks very much for your consideration,
