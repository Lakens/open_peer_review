Sun et al. present intriguing data between the relationship miR-4262 expression and paclitaxel
resistance in NSCLC. The authors find that miR-4262 expression in upregulated in NSCLC tumor
tissue and cell lines when compared to normal adjacent tissue. They also identified a putative
miR-4262 binding site on the 3’ UTR of PTEN mRNA that leads to its suppression. While the
presented data is robust, the manuscript as currently written has limitations.
Major concerns:
1. The paper would benefit from grammatical proofreading from a native English-speaking
author. There are many grammatical, and formatting issues that make the manuscript difficult to
follow at times.
2. What is the sequence of the miR-mimic? Is it the same as endogenous miR-4262?
3. While the miR-4262 mimic suppresses PTEN mRNA, there is no evidence presented that the
mimic alone alters PTEN protein levels (modest decrease in combination with PTX shown in
Figure 6).
4. PTEN specific siRNAs or shRNAs should be used to confirm the relationship between miR-
4262, PTEN, and PTX resistance since miR-4262 has been shown to target other cancer/stemness
genes in breast cancer (e.g. PMID 27629257).
Minor issues.

This is a nice study of the role of a microRNA in cancer drug resistance. The strengths include the
fact that both in vitro and in vivo data are presented and that a potential target of microRNA was
identified to be a gene of high relevance, PTEN. And the data presented are of good quality.
There are also weaknesses that need to be addressed before going forward. The most serious is
the lack of data showing that miR 4262 plays a role in taxol resistance in the parental cancer cell
lines used in xenograft studies. Specifically:
Fig. 5 is fine for showing that adding more miR 4262 to already PTX resistant cells provide
further protection from the drug. But these data do not address whether miR 4262 is responsible
3
for the PTX resistant nature of these cells, nor do they address if miR4262 has a role in the
parental cancer cells (where PTX induces mir 4262). They should knock down miR 4262 (with the
inhibitor or antigomiR) in PTX resistant cells and ask if this restores sensitivity and also in the
parental cells, to see if decreasing miR 4264 increases sensitivity to PTX. Because in vivo studies
in Fig. 7 are with parental cell lines, it is important to show that inhibition of miR4262 makes the
cells more sensitive to PTX in vitro.
Related, Taxol induces miR 4262 expression in cells in Fig. 4 but the opposite happens in the
tumors in Fig. 7. Why this difference?
The writing and the grammar need to be improved; it is not at the level acceptable for an
international journal.
Minor comments:
CCK8 assay measures cell number. Cell number changes could be due to changes in cell
proliferation or cell death or both. In other words, CCK8 does not necessarily measure
proliferation as the authors suggest in Fig. 2A. To conclude that miR 4262 affects cell
proliferation, the authors need to monitor other markers such as BrdU or EdU incorporation,
phospho-H3 or Ki67, or similar. Alternatively, the authors should modify the text to reflect
accurately what CCK8 measures. In fact, since miR 4262 inhibition increases apoptosis, this alone
can explain the CCK8 data.
Why does miR 4262 mimic increase the level of endogenous miR 4262? Clearly endogenous miR
4262 cannot do this.
The migration assay needs either a citation of a reference or more details. What is in the migration
medium? What are the vectors? What are in two chambers and what separates the chambers? Are
the chambers commercial?
Are the miR inhibitor and antigomiR the same? What exactly are these?

The authors have responded comprehensively and adequately to my concerns about the science.
But the writing still needs to improve. The authors used a professional service to ensure the
correctness of the language. The body of the manuscript is in fairly good shape now but there are
still mistakes, some of which are listed below. But the worst is the Abstract, which is the most
important part because this is what the readers will see first. The Abstract in its current form is a
list of experiments along with some results. There is no scientific context provided and no
conclusions stated. The results provided are on the role of miR-4262 in apoptosis, proliferation
and motility, and on the levels of miR-4262 and PTEN. What about the conclusion that miR-4262
is responsible for paclitaxel resistance? Nothing in the Abstract supports or even addresses this
conclusion.
A few examples of writing problems:
The authors need to reconsider word choices; some are sub-optimal. For example, in ‘miR-4262
responded to PTX resistance…’, ‘responded’ may not be the word you want to use.
In the first sentence of the Abstract, do you mean ‘resistant’ instead of ‘resistance’?
The following sentence needs a reference/citation. ‘Previous studies have shown that the
PTEN/PI3K-AKT axis is involved in drug resistance in NSCLC.’

e: Dear reviewer, we’ve carefully revised this manuscript and sent it to a native
peaker for help. We hope the current version can meet your satisfication.
What is the sequence of the miR-mimic? Is it the same as endogenous miR-
4262?
Re: Dear reviewer, the sequence of the miR-4262 mimics is: 5’-
GACAUUCAGACUACCUG-3’. MiRNA mimics could increase the effective
concentration of miRNAs within cells and enhance silencing of target genes [1].
Moreover, miR-mimics is one type of synthetic chemicals and has the same sequence
as the naturally occurring miRNA.Therefore, miR-mimics is expected to target the
same set of mRNAs that is also regulated by the natural miRNA [2].

While the miR-4262 mimic suppresses PTEN mRNA, there is no evidence
presented that the mimic alone alters PTEN protein levels (modest decrease in
combination with PTX shown in Figure 6).
Re: Dear reviewer, we sincerely appreciate your advice. We’ve detected the protein
levels of PTEN in A549 and H1299 cells, and the results are shown in Fig 3C-F,
which revealed that miR-4262 mimics alone suppress both mRNA and protein
expression of PTEN.
PTEN specific siRNAs or shRNAs should be used to confirm the relationship
between miR-4262, PTEN, and PTX resistance since miR-4262 has been shown
to target other cancer/stemness genes in breast cancer (e.g. PMID 27629257).
Re: Dear reviewer, thank you for your suggestion. We’ve confirmed the relationship
between miR-4262, PTEN and PTX resistance further by PTEN specific siRNAs.
And the results indicated that knocking down of PTEN by specific siRNAs had no
effect on miR-4262 expression, but enhanced the resistance of NSCLC cell lines to
PTX (Fig S1).

Re: Dear reviewer, we are sorry for making such mistake, and we’ve corrected this

Re: Dear reviewer, we sincerely appreciate for your advice. Actually, we
nvestigated the role of miR-4262 in NSCLC cell viability, proliferation, apotosis
and migration abilities, which play vital roles in NSCLC progression. The results
showed that miR-4262 promoted cell viability, proliferation, migration, and inhibited
apotosis (Fig 2). Therefore, we changed “development” to “progression”.

R 4262 is responsible for the PTX resistant nature of these cells, nor do they

X resistant cells and ask if this restores sensitivity and also in the parental cells,
see if decreasing miR 4262 increases sensitivity to PTX. Because in vivo studies
Fig. 7 are with parental cell lines, it is important to show that inhibition of
R4262 makes the cells more sensitive to PTX in vitro.
: Dear reviewer, we sincerely appreciate your advices. We’ve reconducted the
priments about miR-4262 and PTX-resistance with miR-4262 inhibitor treatment
up added both in PTX-resistant cells and the parental cells. The results showed that
ocking down the expression of miR-4262 can restore the sensitivity of PTX resistant
ls to PTX (Fig 5C-D). Meanwhile, knocking down the expression of miR-4262
reases the sensitivity of parental cells to PTX (Fig 5E-F).
lated, Taxol induces miR 4262 expression in cells in Fig. 4 but the opposite
ppens in the tumors in Fig. 7. Why this difference?
: Dear reviewer, thank you for point this. We examined our data and found that
litaxel induced miR-4262 expression. In order to confirm the accuracy of the data,
verified this result again through experiments. The results showed that paclitaxel
uced miR-4262 expression (Fig 7D), and we corrected our mistakes, please check.

nor comments:
K8 assay measures cell number. Cell number changes could be due to changes
cell proliferation or cell death or both. In other words, CCK8 does not
cessarily measure proliferation as the authors suggest in Fig. 2A. To conclude
t miR 4262 affects cell proliferation, the authors need to monitor other
rkers such as BrdU or EdU incorporation, phospho-H3 or Ki67, or similar.
ernatively, the authors should modify the text to reflect accurately what CCK8
asures. In fact, since miR 4262 inhibition increases apoptosis, this alone can
plain the CCK8 data.
: Dear reviewer, we sincerely appreciate your advices. In order to make the effect of
R-4262 on cell proliferation and apoptosis more clearly, we detected the expression
Ki67, and the results showed that miR-4262 increased the expression of Ki67 and
moted cell proliferation (Fig 2C). Menwhile, to reflect accurately what CCK8
asures, we’ve modified the description of CCK8 assay in the method section, as
lows: Quantitative cell viability was evaluated with a CCK-8 assay. The cells used
the experiments were inoculated into wells of a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells per well)
ernight to adhere. After transfection for a certain period of time (24, 48, 72 and 96
each well was added 20 µl of CCK-8 solution (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO)
another 4 hours. Then, the absorbance value (optical density) values were
ermined at 450 nm with an ELISA reader (MultiskanEX, Lab systems, Helsinki,
land).
hy does miR 4262 mimic increase the level of endogenous miR 4262? Clearly
dogenous miR 4262 cannot do this.
: Dear reviewer, thank you for pointing this out. We’ve corrected the descrption
out miR-4262 mimics, which has the same sequence but not identical structure with
dogenous miR-4262, and clearly clarified that miR-4262 mimics can act as
dogenous miR-4262 once it enters the cell and enhance silencing of target genes [1],
tead of increase the level of endogenous miR-4262.

e migration assay needs either a citation of a reference or more details. What
n the migration medium? What are the vectors? What are in two chambers
d what separates the chambers? Are the chambers commercial?
: Dear reviewer, thank you for point this. Migration chambers were peurchased from
oning. These chambers can be put and suspended in 24-plate. A filter membrane in
per chamber (transwell insert) separates it from the lower chamber [1]. Cells are
ded in the upper chamber and cells migrate through the membrane to the lower
mber of the culture plate that contains chemotactic stimuli (Serum is often utilized)
. Thus, cells can migrate to serum-containing side.

RNA. And miR antagomir is another type of inhibitor, which is specifically modified

authors have responded comprehensively and adequately to my concerns about the science. But
writing still needs to improve. The authors used a professional service to ensure the correctness
he language. The body of the manuscript is in fairly good shape now but there are still mistakes,
e of which are listed below. But the worst is the Abstract, which is the most important part because
is what the readers will see first. The Abstract in its current form is a list of experiments along
h some results. There is no scientific context provided and no conclusions stated. The results
vided are on the role of miR-4262 in apoptosis, proliferation and motility, and on the levels of
R-4262 and PTEN. What about the conclusion that miR-4262 is responsible for paclitaxel
stance? Nothing in the Abstract supports or even addresses this conclusion.
Dear reviewer. Thank you for your advice. We have improved the abstract, as follows:
n-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered to be the primary cause of cancer-related
rtalities worldwide. Paclitaxel (PTX), either as a monotherapy or in combination with other
gs, is an alternative therapy for advanced NSCLC. However, cancer cell resistance against
litaxel represents a major clinical problem. This study aimed to investigate the role and
derlying mechanism of miR-4262 in paclitaxel (PTX)-resistant NSCLC. The levels of miR-
2 were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). A luciferase
orter assay and bioinformatics were used to explore the potential target gene of miR-4262.
gulation miR-4262 and PTEN expressions in NSCLC were conducted by transfection. PTX-
istant A549 and H1299 cells were established by stepwise screening through increasing the
X concentration in the cultures. In vivo tumourigenesis experiments were used to explore the
cts of miR-4262 and PTX. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell migration were detected
ng a CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and Transwell migration assay, respectively. PI3K/Akt
hway-related proteins were detected by western blot. MiR-4262 expression was significantly
egulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and miR-4262 targeted PTEN. Besides, miR-4262
uced PTX chemoresistance by promoting survival and migration in A549/PTX and
299/PTX cells. Moreover, miR-4262 expression and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related
teins was up-regulated and PTEN was down-regulated in A549/PTX and H1299/PTX cells.
r results indicated that miR-4262 enhances PTX resistance in NSCLC cells through targeting
EN and activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The inhibition of miR-4262 expression
ht be an improved treatment to overcome PTX resistance in NSCLC.
ew examples of writing problems:
authors need to reconsider word choices; some are sub-optimal. For example, in ‘miR-4262
ponded to PTX resistance…’, ‘responded’ may not be the word you want to use.
Dear reviewer. Thank you for your advice. ‘We found that miR-4262 responded to PTX
istance by altering the PTEN expression level and the subsequently activated PI3K/AKT
naling pathway’ has been changed to ‘We found that miR-4262 was responsible for PTX
istance by altering the PTEN expression level and the subsequently activated PI3K/AKT
naling pathway’.
he first sentence of the Abstract, do you mean ‘resistant’ instead of ‘resistance’?
Dear reviewer. Thank you for your advice. We changed ‘resistance’ to ‘resistant’. The
tence changes consistently from ‘This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying
chanism of miR-4262 in paclitaxel (PTX)-resistance non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)’ to
is study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of miR-4262 in paclitaxel
X)-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)’.
following sentence needs a reference/citation. ‘Previous studies have shown that the PTEN/PI3K-
T axis is involved in drug resistance in NSCLC.’
Dear reviewer. Thank you for your advice. We have supplemented the references as follows:
vious studies have shown that the PTEN/PI3K-AKT axis is involved in drug resistance in
CLC [Ref.1].’
