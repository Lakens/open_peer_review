Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In this manuscript, Rossi F. and coauthors make use of the transgenic RNAi technology and the
l(3)mbt tumor model, to screen over 4000 genes for those required to inhibit malignant growth.
They initially tested a selected group of 233 candidate genes and analyzed the effect of the
corresponding RNAi by working out the statistics of maximum brain Feret diameters. They then
used the know-how from the first screen, to design a procedure to screen 4,090RNAi lines
corresponding to 4,075 genes, representing 30% of the protein coding sequences in Drosophila
melanogaster. Taken together their results identified 131 suppressors of mbt tumor growth,
which can be linked to different gene ontologies including histone modifications, DNA damage
response, germ cell development. Remarkably they demonstrate that most of these target genes
are not significantly overexpressed in mbt tumors, indicating that up-regulation of gene
expression is not a good predictor of functional requirement. Among the target genes that they
identified, meiotic W68 is the Drosophila orthologue of the human Cancer-testis gene SPO11,
which encodes the enzymes that catalyzes the formation of meiotic double strand breaks. Finally,
by showing that that ionizing radiation can functionally substitute for Drosophila Mei-W68, they
demonstrate that the pro-tumoral role of Mei-W68/SPO11 is associated with its endonuclease
activity.
The article is really interesting and opens up new horizons in the use of Drosophila tumor models
for investigating the contribution of human cancer genes to malignancy.
I suggest the following minor changes:
1) Because there are only 4 figures in the article, I would suggest showing Figure S3 as new
Figure 5, as a summary of the main results derived from the screen.
2) Page 7, the sentence “Following this reasoning the 4 RNAi lines (CG31373, png, spnD
and nbs)..” is not clear. I suggest modifying it.
3) Page 12, line 388. I suggest to change the text as follows “ Our data, by demonstrating
that ionizing radiation can functionally substitute for Drosophila Mei-W68, strongly suggest that
pro-tumoral role of Mei-W68/SPO11 is associated with its endonuclease activity. “
4) There are many typos. For example page 9, line 278 “mbt tumpur growth” should be
changed to mbt tumor growth”; line 289 “down-regulated in following” should be changed to
“down-regulated following”
5) I would suggest using commas when the sentences are very long. This would facilitate
the reader. For example on page 8, line 240, the sentence starting with “In the high content
screen”, I would suggest adding a comma after the word “screen” and a comma after “CG4975)”

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
In this manuscript the authors describe a very elegant and powerful screening strategy that
allowed them to identify novel genes involved in tumorigenesis. They have taken advantage of a
well-characterized model of brain tumors induced by the loss of lethal(3)malignant brain tumour
(mbt) in Drosophila. Previous studies, including some published by this group, have
demonstrated that this model generates bonefide malignant tumors in Drosophila, validating this
model for cancer research. The authors have performed RNAi screens targeting 1/3 of the
Drosophila genome (more than 4000 genes) and have identified at least 131 genes that may have a
relevant role in tumorigenesis. Interestingly, many of these genes are related to the DNA damage
response, histone modification and germ cell development, indicating that these processes are
particularly sensitive in the Mbt tumors.
One of the most interesting messages of this paper is that the overexpression of genes in a given
tumor is not indicative of its biological relevance for tumorigenesis. The authors provide several
evidences supporting this idea. First, most of the genes that were upregulated in the Mbt tumors
do not appear as hits in the screen. Second, in conditions where tumors were prevented, for
example by targeting Mei-W68/SPO11, the transcriptional program activated by the loss of Mbt
was still present.
In addition the authors have validated and characterized the pro-tumorigenic role of one of the
hits, the endonuclease Mei-W68/SPO11. The authors have nicely shown that this enzyme -that is
normally involved in generating physiological DSBs- may promote tumorigenesis by inducing
unscheduled DSBs and genomic instability, at least, in this mbt tumorigenic model.

As a minor comment/correction, the authors should check the nomenclature of the human genes
in the manuscript. Human genes should be written in capital letters and italics.
In summary, I believe that this is a relevant study that provides a powerful screening strategy to
identify genes involved in tumorigenesis and has identified a number of novel genes potentially
relevant in cancer. Therefore, I strongly recommend it for publication in Open Biology.

Appendix A
Response to Referees
We thank the reviewers for the useful comments they made to our manuscript. We
have addressed all of them as detailed below.
From Referee 1:
1) Because there are only 4 figures in the article, I would suggest showing Figure S3
as new Figure 5, as a summary of the main results derived from the screen. As
suggested, in the revised version, the previously submitted Figure S3 is now reported
as Figure 5.
2) Page 7, the sentence “Following this reasoning the 4 RNAi lines (CG31373, png,
spnD and nbs)..” is not clear. I suggest modifying it.
The sentence has been modified and the new text reads: “Following this reasoning the
4 RNAi lines (CG31373, png, spn-D and nbs) that were classified as neutral (blue) by the
algorithm, but fall within this first part of the plot, could also be considered as
suppressors of mbt tumor growth.”
3) Page 12, line 388. I suggest to change the text as follows “ Our data, by
demonstrating that ionizing radiation can functionally substitute for Drosophila Mei-
W68, strongly suggest that pro-tumoral role of Mei-W68/SPO11 is associated with its
endonuclease activity. “
The sentence has been revised following the reviewer’s comment and the new text
reads: “Our data demonstrating that ionizing radiation can functionally substitute for
Drosophila Mei-W68, strongly suggests that the pro-tumoral role of Mei-W68/SPO11 is
associated with its endonuclease activity.”
4) There are many typos. For example page 9, line 278 “mbt tumpur growth”
should be changed to mbt tumor growth”; line 289 “down-regulated in following”
should be changed to “down-regulated following”
The whole text has been checked for typos and corrections have been made.
5) I would suggest using commas when the sentences are very long. This would
facilitate the reader. For example on page 8, line 240, the sentence starting with “In
the high content screen”, I would suggest adding a comma after the word “screen”
and a comma after “CG4975)”
We revised the whole manuscript accordingly.
From Referee 2:
As a minor comment/correction, the authors should check the nomenclature of the
human genes in the manuscript. Human genes should be written in capital letters
and italics.
Following the reviewer’s comment, we revised the nomenclature of the human genes.
