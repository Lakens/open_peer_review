Summary
Little is known about chemoreception in Platynereis. It is thought that nuchal organs, palps,
antennae, and tentacular cirri are chemoreceptive organs. GCaMP was used to image the activity
of cells in these sensory organs during controlled delivery of chemical stimuli in a microfluidic
device. Antennae respond similarly to the four types of chemical stimuli used, while nuchal
organs, palps, and tentacular cirri respond differentially. This, along with ultrastructure of the
antennae, indicate that the antennae may be responsible for the general identification of chemical
cues, while the other organs are more specialized. Analysis of the timing of responses to stimuli
in different areas indicates that apical organ cells, eyefront cells, and fronto-dorsal cells may be
involved in a chemosensory circuit. Cells in the mushroom bodies responding to some
chemosensory cues at a delay compared to the sensory organs, indicating that these may be
involved in integration of chemical cues.
Comments
Methods
- State in the methods the reason for doing the flow control
- Add the method for determining when muscle contraction in the trunk or stomodeum was
determined. In the figure this data is plotted as a kymograph but the method is never explained.
- Using a dye in the stimulus would have taken away the variability in the onset and offset
timing. This was later stated in the discussion
- Page 16 line 622- should be citing figure 3b
Figures
- Text in some figures is too small, for example figure 4 n values.
- Shapes on figure 5b are too small to distinguish. The shapes are also not labeled.
Results
- Page 5 line 115- It’s not clear what the difference between the two sets of delay times are.
- Page 12 line 452- It’s stated that “single-cell responses to stimulants in the nuchal organs were
hardly repeatable” and references Figure 3C. However, only two example traces are shown, one
of which shows the response repeating and the other showing the response not repeating.
Quantification on why the responses are considered “hardly repeatable” should be shown or this
statement should be further explained in text.

In this paper Chartier and colleagues use live Ca2+ imaging to study chemosensory responses of
juvenile aquatic Platynereis dumerilii. The authors identify and functionally describe 4 main and
3 secondary chemosensory organs that respond to four test stimulants. This paper provides a
valuable contribution to our knowledge of chemosensation in aquatic invertebrates, and points
towards intriguing early integration of signals, potentially mediated by different classes of
chemoreceptors.
Major comments
1. What is known about the chemicals, ecologically relevant for the 6dpf stage of Platynereis?
What, if any, natural behaviours are these animals known to perform?
2. Please discuss, whenever possible, where the projections from the four main chemosensory
organs go?
3. Please make it clear how many cells were responding in each of the four main organs. Is it one
pair of cells or more per organ? If more, what exactly is shown in Figure 3A and have you
observed any functional differences between cells belonging to the same organ?
4. Please discuss, based on your findings, what chemosensory receptors are likely to be expressed
in each main chemosensory organ/cell. I find it interesting that same cells respond to all 4
stimulants. I would have expected to see one subset of IR-expressing cells to respond to 1-butanol
and amyl acetate, and the other subset of GR-expressing cells - to glutamate and sucrose.
4
5. Given the high activity of the lateral regions (Fig 3A), why are they not classified as main
chemosensory organs?
6. Images in Figure 2 show the cells of interest as well as many other cells that are equally bright.
It would be nice to have supplementary videos showing activity of the cells of interest. Please
also discuss whether the responding cells are (sensory) neurons or not, and if so – why.
7. The paper is difficult to follow because of the numerous abbreviations in Figures the meaning
of which is not immediately obvious. Please explain abbreviations in the legends, or ideally, write
them in full in the Figures, and also in the text when referring to a Figure.
8. Please shorten and streamline the paper (I made some suggestions below). The rationale
behind analyses in Figure 4 and Figure 5 should be clearly explained.
9. I suggest combining Figures 2 and 3 in the following way. New Figure 2 includes all
information from current figures 2 and 3 about the four main chemosensory organs. New Figure
3 (or this could be a supplemental figure) includes all other information.
10. I suggest significantly shortening Discussion, as well as sections 4, 5 and 6 of Results.
Minor comments
1. Page 3, line 31 – should be "there" instead of "this"?
2. Page 3, line 65 – should be Figure 1A,B,C.
3. Page 5, lines 132-140 – please refer here to Figure 2.
4. Figures 1 ,2 and 4– please indicate in the legend the abbreviation for nuchal organ and all other
organs that are studied in the paper. Please remove all non-essential abbreviations.
5. Figure 2 – the regions of interest are hard to see in the white-on-black images, especially when
printed out. Perhaps inverting black and white could make the images more clear? Please also
increase the width of white dashed and solid lines, and the font size of abbreviations.
6. Figure 2 – please provide Z coordinates for each of the panels.
7. Figure 2 – I presume that each active cell may be seen in more than one horizontal plane. If so, I
suggest giving each active cell a unique number, and indicating all active cells on each A1-J1
image.
8. Figure 3A, leftmost column – why do the light-blue bars go both above and below zero, and all
other light-blue bars on the right only go below zero?
9. Line 391 – wrong reference?

Appendix A
Chartier et al, Chemosensory activity in Platynereis. Response to
referees.
Referee: 1
Methods
- State in the methods the reason for doing the flow control -> reformulated and left
in the Results section line 107-109. The separation of sensory modalities is a crucial
experimental issue here, and the three-channels design is central to the purpose of
the microfluidic device explained in this paragraph.
- Add the method for determining when muscle contraction in the trunk or
stomodeum was determined. In the figure this data is plotted as a kymograph but the
method is never explained. -> added in Methods, line 662-665.
- Using a dye in the stimulus would have taken away the variability in the onset and
offset timing. This was later stated in the discussion -> added in Discussion, line 491-
493. We did try a number of dyes and could not find any that did not trigger a
response in the antennal cells.
- Page 16 line 622- should be citing figure 3b -> Figure 3A,B added, line 643
Figures
- Text in some figures is too small, for example figure 4 n values. -> corrected in Figures
1 to 5 and S2
- Shapes on figure 5b are too small to distinguish. The shapes are also not labelled. ->
We have removed the different shapes. The initial reason for having them was to
show that the two apical organ cells are sometimes unsynchronized, but the figure
was not very explicit graphically and this can anyway be seen on the activity traces
(Figure 5A).
Results
- Page 5 line 115- It’s not clear what the difference between the two sets of delay
times are. -> reformulated and clarified in the text
- Page 12 line 452- It’s stated that “single-cell responses to stimulants in the nuchal
organs were hardly repeatable” and references Figure 3C. However, only two example
traces are shown, one of which shows the response repeating and the other showing
the response not repeating. Quantification on why the responses are considered
“hardly repeatable” should be shown or this statement should be further explained in
text. -> clarified in Results, line 114-118
Referee: 2
Major comments
1. What is known about the chemicals, ecologically relevant for the 6dpf stage of
Platynereis? What, if any, natural behaviours are these animals known to perform? -
> added in Introduction, line 83-85 and 68-69
2. Please discuss, whenever possible, where the projections from the four main
chemosensory organs go? -> was already stated in Results part 2, except for nuchal
organs, added line 146
3. Please make it clear how many cells were responding in each of the four main
organs. Is it one pair of cells or more per organ? If more, what exactly is shown in
Figure 3A and have you observed any
functional differences between cells belonging to the same organ? -> the number of
responding cells has been clarified in Results part 2. Activity shown in Figure 3A
corresponds to responses in at least one cell on at least one of the two sides, as
stated in Methods, line 607-609. We did try a few experiments to see differential
responses in antennae and palps, but with no success so far. We added this
comment in Discussion, line 367-368.
4. Please discuss, based on your findings, what chemosensory receptors are likely to
be expressed in each main chemosensory organ/cell. I find it interesting that same
cells respond to all 4 stimulants. I would have expected to see one subset of IR-
expressing cells to respond to 1-butanol and amyl acetate, and the other subset of GR-
expressing cells - to glutamate and sucrose. -> This point is indeed of interest,
especially for the nuchal organs’ revolver cells which respond to several compounds
and are likely to express several types of receptors, contrary to what seems to be
generally true in mammals and insects. However, we prefer not to comment on this
point, and wait until we look ourselves into Platynereis’ genome. We do not know
which candidate genes Platynereis has, and feel any hypothesis would be too
speculative at this stage. No prior knowledge exists on the molecular physiology of
chemosensation in annelids, and the only published pieces of information on
potential annelid chemoreceptor genes come from Capitella teleta, a species quite
distant from Platynereis (see phylogeny in Struck et al., Nature, 2011) and having a
different lifestyle (sedentary vs errant). These species could thus have strongly
differing chemoreceptor gene complements, as was found in insects between
fruitflies and honeybees for example.
5. Given the high activity of the lateral regions (Fig 3A), why are they not classified as
main chemosensory organs? -> added in Discussion, line 349-353. We think this
question cannot be settled at present.
6. Images in Figure 2 show the cells of interest as well as many other cells that are
equally bright. It
would be nice to have supplementary videos showing activity of the cells of interest.
-> We have prepared supplementary videos showing examples of calcium activity in
a few regions.
Please also discuss whether the responding cells are (sensory) neurons or not, and if
so – why. -> added in Discussion, line 355-363.
7. The paper is difficult to follow because of the numerous abbreviations in Figures
the meaning of which is not immediately obvious. Please explain abbreviations in the
legends, or ideally, write them in full in the Figures, and also in the text when referring
to a Figure. -> we have now explained the main abbreviations in the legends of
Figure 2, 4, S2 and S3. The accessory abbreviations, which are useful for the readers
specialist of annelids, have been kept away from legends for brevity, and are
available in the full list of abbreviations at the end of the article. (Repositioned line
680-690, maybe it had been overlooked)
8. Please shorten and streamline the paper (I made some suggestions below). The
rationale behind
analyses in Figure 4 and Figure 5 should be clearly explained. -> the rationales have
been clarified at the beginning of Results section 5 and 6 respectively.
9. I suggest combining Figures 2 and 3 in the following way. New Figure 2 includes all
information from current figures 2 and 3 about the four main chemosensory organs.
New Figure 3 (or this could be a supplemental figure) includes all other information. -
> We had thought about that, but prefer presenting first all ten active regions in a
single, uniform anatomy figure. Moreover, this reflects better our approach of
looking at the entire brain activity with no a priori on which part would show
activity.
10. I suggest significantly shortening Discussion, as well as sections 4, 5 and 6 of
Results. -> we have streamlined the whole text after making all modifications. We
have shortened the Results by about 160 words, but we did not significantly shorten
the Discussion as we wish to keep all points currently discussed.
Minor comments
1. Page 3, line 31 – should be "there" instead of "this"? -> “this” is what we mean
2. Page 3, line 65 – should be Figure 1A,B,C. -> corrected, line 64
3. Page 5, lines 132-140 – please refer here to Figure 2. -> corrected, line 134
4. Figures 1 ,2 and 4– please indicate in the legend the abbreviation for nuchal organ
and all other organs that are studied in the paper. Please remove all non-essential
abbreviations. -> we have now explained the main abbreviations in the legends of
Figure 2, 4, S2 and S3. Non-essential abbreviations are kept in all figures for annelid
specialists, but explained only in the abbreviations list at the end of the article (line
680-690), not in legends.
5. Figure 2 – the regions of interest are hard to see in the white-on-black images,
especially when printed out. Perhaps inverting black and white could make the images
more clear? -> we have tried inverting black and white but this doesn’t improve
visibility. Unfortunately this is due to raw data quality.
Please also increase the width of white dashed and solid lines, and the font size of
abbreviations. -> changed in Figure 2 and Figure S2
6. Figure 2 – please provide Z coordinates for each of the panels. -> to avoid crowding
this anatomy figure, we preferred indicating the corresponding Z planes in Figure S2,
as stated in the legend of Figure 2.
7. Figure 2 – I presume that each active cell may be seen in more than one horizontal
plane. If so, I
suggest giving each active cell a unique number, and indicating all active cells on each
A1-J1 image. -> This is generally not the case, an active cell is seen in only one plane.
We have also added a comment on the bilaterality of responses (line 464-473, 618-
620 and Figure S6), discussing why responses are sometimes seen only on one side
of the head.
8. Figure 3A, leftmost column – why do the light-blue bars go both above and below
zero, and all other light-blue bars on the right only go below zero? -> this corresponds
to the control experiments (as explained in Methods, line 637-642) where the
channel normally containing a stimulant contains only sea water, hence the top bar
is light blue instead of being colour-coded for a stimulus.
9. Line 391 – wrong reference? -> corrected, line 401
