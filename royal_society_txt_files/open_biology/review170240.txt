Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The work of Wang and colleagues presents an analysis of three different transgenic mouse
myosins behaviour obtained from in vitro motility and Qdot assays. Modulating the alpha-
actinin concentration, force-velocity and force-power curves have been obtained. The data has
been analysed in a mathematical framework, modified from previous works in literature, to
estimate several properties, in particular the variation of step-size frequencies at different loads
and myosin isoforms. These informations are interpreted in a working hypothesis about a four-
paths cross-bridge cycle, previously proposed by some of the authors.
The isoforms chosen are related to some important cardiac pathologies, and the in vitro analysis
is interestingly compared to the similar in vivo analysis obtained by the authors in previous
works. The mathematical framework used for the analysis of the data seems robust under several
aspects and the differences between isoforms are well explained and described in the
physiological context.
On the other side, I have found some limits in the text and in the approach.
1) I have found the text difficult to be read, at least for a general reader. It lacks of a clear work
overview in the introduction (and possibly even in the abstract), explaining the experimental
setup and data which will be shown (eventually with a figure for the setup). Similarly, in
“methods” the mathematical treatments for different analyses, correlated one to each other, and
their parameters and constants, are introduced without a clear explanation of when and how they
will be used to analyse the data. I suggest to rewrite the text, introducing already in this section
the sentences found later. Just as an example, I would move lines 496-501 in this section. In
general, I suggest to clearly state in Methods, after each subsection, the constants imposed and
the free parameters to be fitted from the data, which data will be used and the subsequent steps
that have been done to reach the values shown in the figures. In this respect, the way in which the
simulation of the motility event-velocity histograms is done is crucial for the text and cannot be
limited to a citation of a previous work (line 222).
2) As a possible strong limitation of the model, I think equations 12 and 13 hypothesises a linear
dependence of the average step size and duty ratio from motility velocity (eqs. 8-11), while it has
been shown, as reported also in the text, that the motility velocity shows a nonlinear dependence,
for instance, from the amount of slow and fast isoform (eq. 15). I think a nonlinear dependence
could also be generated from different step-sizes, possibly affecting also the analysis presented in
this work. I suggest to introduce a discussion in this respect about the strength of such an
hypothesis.
3
3) The working hypothesis used to analyse the data is based on a four-path cross-bridge cycle
proposed by the authors in previous works. The hypothesis seems to me quite new and non-
conventional, therefore I strongly suggest to include a “relationship to other studies” section to
explain the necessity of introducing such an hypothesis. For instance, a comparison with similar
data obtained in ref. [26] has been made (L 585-593), but in that work a more conventional cross-
bridge cycle is used, with two subsequent steps. Is this simpler model incompatible with the data
obtained in this work? What are the limits of working hypotheses proposed in previous works?
Moreover, I do not fully understand the difference between the 8 nm and 5+3 nm paths or the
likelihood of path of 3 nm, which, if I well understood, is made by a useless 5 nm step in the
detached state followed by a 3 nm step in the attached state. Some explanation about this process
should be included. Finally, I am confused by lines 461-469 which makes some clear statements
about the *velocity* of the completion of the cycle related to the tension in the ELC, in
relationship with the subsequent sentence in lines 471-474 which switches to the *probability* of
longer or shorter steps. ELC-ratchet checkpoint seems to be at the end of the cycle and I do not
understand how it may affect the whole cycle itself. it should be clarified.
Minor points are:
The term “parameters” and “constants” in lines 182 and 184 respectively are somehow confusing.
I suggest to include a table, eventually in the SM, with the values imposed in the equations (not
deduced from the experimental data).
The term “immobilized” in line 194 is not easy to be understood. I suggest to clarify it.
In line 231 it should be written “=1 vu” because the ratio is not a pure number.
In line 454 “vivo” should read “in vivo”, I think.
As far as I understand, the analysis is not based on single motors but on arrays of motors acting
on a single actin filament. Despite the hierarchy is simpler than in in vivo muscles, the basic
structure is somehow preserved. Therefore I would reformulate the sentences in lines 109, 580
and 675 to account for this aspect.
I suggest to introduce a comment on the analysed stiffness per motor (line 629) and to make a
comparison with previously published values.

I found the paper hard to follow. In my opinion the writing has jargons that are not helping
understanding and the presentation of data is obscure. I struggled to understand how Fig 5 is
built, and anyway there are contradictions for the claimed conclusion: for instance why in the
E143K there are more events at higher velocity for a force of 204 pN with respect to 112pN.
Shouldn't the modulation of step size frequency by force determine a lower velocity?
Also obscure is the reason why the power can only rise with increse of load (Fig 4).
In Eq 8 s(m) goes to zero for F(d) = 0, it looks a contradiction.

The manuscript by Wang et al. examines the properties of purified myosin from mouse hearts
with point mutations in the essential light chain that are associated with cardiomyopathies in
humans. The human essential light chain with the point mutations was expressed in the mouse
model, but there is still the endogenous mouse ELC expressed which makes the purified myosin
a non-homogenous species. Thus, the results which are based on a thorough characterization
using ATPase and in vitro motility methods have to be interpreted qualitatively since it is not
known how much of the mutant ELC is bound to the myosin heavy chain and this could vary
from prep to prep. The results are fairly convincing that there are differences in the motile and
biochemical properties of mouse myosin caused by the presence of the mutant human ELCs even
if the quantitative nature of this differences is difficult to dissect. The trend appears quite
interesting that the duty ratio, motility velocity, and various mechanical measurements show
clear differences. Most of the paper focuses on the methods that are developed using the Qdot
motility assay which has been published previously but this study performs a direct comparison
of mutant myosins. They also examine the Qdot motility assay in the presence of a tethering load
and are able to pull out isometric force, power, and a measure of the elastic properties of the
myosin. These methods are impressive and may be useful in future studies that are attempting to
compare disease mutations using in vitro assays.
Specific changes for the authors to consider:
The abstract is very general and not very informative about what was performed and the key
results of the work.
Add more to the discussion of the two mutations in terms of integrating the in vitro results with
the physiological impact on the animal as well as what is known to occur in humans. The Yuan et
al study should be referenced in places where similar studies were performed on the E143K
mutant (Qdot motility assay).
The paper is quite long and tries to do too much (compare the mutations, describe several new
methods and analyses, discuss the hypothesis that the authors have about step size variability).
Many of these interesting ideas seem to get lost in the paper because of its length and attempt to
address so many topics.

label_comment_4
The authors measured the unitary step size of cardiac myosin molecules including wild type and
mutants in the presence of alpha-actinin. With several assumptions on step sizes, loads and
mixture of mutants, they analyzed step distribution of step size, force velocity relationship and
chemical reaction route.
I found serious problems in the manuscript and the text difficult to understand.
Serious problems.
1. There are no clear unitary step sizes of wild and other type of myosin shown in Figure 3. What
histogram was obtained at changing the velocity (vu)? How was the significance of step size
determined at varied velocities (vu)? The three unitary step-sizes are unreliable at the present
manuscript.
2. The definition of the unitary step-size is the displacement (power stroke distance) per ATP
molecules hydrolysis driven by single molecules of motor protein (equations 8-13). The
displacements of actin filaments driven by myosin assemble in an in vitro motility were
generated by detachment of positively and negatively loaded myosin, detachment of loaded
alpha-actinin and reverse reaction of power stroke as well as the power stroke of myosin. These
displacements were not distinguishable from that of the power stroke in the motility assay.
3. It is known that multiple myosin molecules generate power strokes cooperatively (Huxley
&Simmons Nature 1971, Kaya et al Nat. Comm. 2017). In the cooperative action, the step sizes
driven by multiple myosin molecules are not simple summation of step size driven by single
molecule because the myosin had elasticity and force changed the reaction rate. In the
manuscript, the elasticity of myosin and non-linearity of step size summation were not assumed
in the calculation.
8
4. The purified mutant myosin contained both wild and mutant myosin (Fig. 1). This makes an
interpretation of experimental result very difficult (equations 14-17). The homo-dimer of mutant
myosin is strongly recommended to use.
Major comments.
1. Abstract is difficult to understand. Experiment, result, simulation and major suggestion will be
described in abstract.
2. Introduction is difficult to understand. There are many works on step size and rotational
motion of myosin (first and second paragraphs). The authors should cite the general works, other
than their works. In other paragraphs, the authors should cite the general works that are
background of the present work. Otherwise, we are not able to understand significance of the
manuscript.
3. Line 166-172: The error of Qdot position bound to actin filaments at no motile is important
information to know the vibration of apparatus, photon noise and error of position calculation,
etc. The authors should indicate the position error of Qdot, for example,in an in vitro assay in the
absence of ATP.
There are no data of position of Qdot during sliding of actin. The original data before analyzing
the step size is very important to understand the quality of position measurements.
4. line 174-188: The load in an in vitro assay was applied by alpha-actinin interacting with actin
filaments. There are many unknown parameters such as linearity of elasticity of apha-actinin,
actual number of alpha-actinin bound to actin filaments, error of all parameters shown in the
equation 2 and 3.
5.Figure 6: The reaction model is very complicated. I do not understand what results support
which chemical routes and states.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_6
The manuscript presents detailed analysis of the impact of disease causing mutations to the
essential light chain of cardiac myosin and interprets these impacts with a novel model that
incorporates the function of the myosin essential light chain isoform with a long N-terminal
extension. The strain sensing features of the essential light chain appear to be modulated by the
mutations causing changes in the step size distribution. There are places in the manuscript where
clarifications would be useful as described below:
1. Can the authors provide any further insight into the role of the N-terminal truncated essential
light chain? If only one isoform is required, why are both expressed?
13
2. The use of the term "autonomous" in describing myosin needs a clearer definition. Myosin is
receiving input from a variety of external sources that modify its behavior. How is that
autonomous?
3. The observed differences in step sizes (3 nm, 5 nm, 8 nm) is highly reminiscent of the
previously reported stepwise shortening of the sarcomere (Pollack et al., "Sarcomere shortening
in striated muscle occurs in stepwise fashion." Nature 268:757-759 and subsequent publications
on this topic) in which 2-3 nm quanta of stepsize variations were detected, but never fully
explained. Could the authors comment on the possible relationship of their work to this previous
literature?
4. The figure legends should clearly indicate which data are from simulations and which are from
motility assay measurements.
5. The forces plotted in Figure 7 seem to be too high for 1000 nm actin filament lengths. A myosin
head generates 3-4 pN (Finer et al., "Single myosin mechanics: piconewton forces and nanometre
steps." 368:113-9) and given the repeat distance of an actin filament of about 40 nm, there are at
most about 1000 nm/40nm = 25 myosins bound at one time, an upper limit of nearly 25 x 4 pN =
100 pN seems likely. Please clarify.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have satisfactorily addressed the previous concerns. I would strongly advise them to
incorporate shortened/brief versions of their responses to Reviewer's 4 Serious Problems 1, 2, 3
and 4 to the text. Additionally, further editing and clarifying the text will be beneficial.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript presents detailed analysis of the impact of disease causing mutations to the
essential light chain of cardiac myosin and interprets these impacts with a novel model that
incorporates the function of the myosin essential light chain isoform with a long N-terminal
extension. The strain sensing features of the essential light chain appear to be modulated by the
mutations causing changes in the step size distribution. There are places in the manuscript where
clarifications would be useful as described below:
1. Can the authors provide any further insight into the role of the N-terminal truncated essential
light chain? If only one isoform is required, why are both expressed?
2. The use of the term "autonomous" in describing myosin needs a clearer definition. Myosin is
receiving input from a variety of external sources that modify its behavior. How is that
autonomous?
3. The observed differences in step sizes (3 nm, 5 nm, 8 nm) is highly reminiscent of the
previously reported stepwise shortening of the sarcomere (Pollack et al., "Sarcomere shortening
in striated muscle occurs in stepwise fashion." Nature 268:757-759 and subsequent publications
on this topic) in which 2-3 nm quanta of stepsize variations were detected, but never fully
explained. Could the authors comment on the possible relationship of their work to this previous
literature?
4. The figure legends should clearly indicate which data are from simulations and which are from
motility assay measurements.
5. The forces plotted in Figure 7 seem to be too high for 1000 nm actin filament lengths. A myosin
head generates 3-4 pN (Finer et al., "Single myosin mechanics: piconewton forces and nanometre
steps." 368:113-9) and given the repeat distance of an actin filament of about 40 nm, there are at
most about 1000 nm/40nm = 25 myosins bound at one time, an upper limit of nearly 25 x 4 pN =
100 pN seems likely. Please clarify.

plified. The Introduction was re-written to better overview work described in the manuscript. The first
paragraphs describe the background in vitro and in vivo work measuring single myosin
racteristics in cardiac muscle. The third paragraph indicates the unknowns that we want to figure out
generally how we intend to do it. The fourth paragraph introduces the medical relevance of the
eins and experiments and in the last paragraph we give the broad overview of findings.

hods are now separated into two sections beginning with their development for application to samples
m pure species and ending with the more complex application to heterogeneous samples

to have no impact on results but it introduces myosin elasticity. Myosin elasticity is a unique and
able mechanical characterization that shows an interesting and informative contrast between mutant
cies.
ults were reorganized. The revised manuscript has Qdot assay results summarized first culminating in
re-introduction (from an earlier publication) of a revised pathway scheme in Figure 6 and quantitation
he flux through the pathways in Table 1. The conventional in vitro motility experiments giving myosin
e-velocity and elasticity are now in one continuous subsection of Results and contained in Figures 8-
nd Table 2.
stants taken from the literature are quoted when used in Methods (eg., line 182). Fitted parameters
endent on data introduced in the manuscript are defined in Methods but their values (including
tional concentrations of pure species, step-sizes, step-frequencies, detachment rates, and more) are
ays contained in Results. We think this is appropriate.

other context for nonlinear was when modeling motility for inhomogeneous myosin samples. We
e revised the manuscript to clarify how we manage this difficulty as summarized on the third
agraph in response to Comment 1 above. Generally, the velocity nonlinearity is negligible for the
ples used due to the large fraction of the major species (discussed starting with line 315).

elationship to other studies. Reviewer comments have stimulated several alterations in the manuscript
ted to our proposed 4-pathway network (now Figure 6). The referee mentions a conventional vs our
del wherein two subsequent steps (5 then 3 nm) is replaced by 8, 5+3, or 5 nm steps. Our 8 and 5+3
ways are equivalent to the conventional picture. We differ from convention by also identifying a solo-
m step. Our model is based on previous and unmistakable observation of unequal 3 and 5 nm step-
uencies (Wang et al. 2013). Our ability to distinguish separated 3 and 5 nm unitary steps is probably
m the unique ability of the Qdot assay to ascertain single actomyosin interactions from myosin
embles. We simply disagree with a model that does not allow a solo-5 nm step.
re recently we observed a large fraction of the solo-3 nm step-size in vivo in the near isometric heart
rghardt et al. 2017). The in vivo data shows how single myosin lever-arms rotate but under conditions
n multiple myosins are simultaneously interacting with the same actin filament. This is again a unique
ure of our approach leading to new observations about the native system. The latter is consistent but
required by the new in vitro data presented here. We have revised the discussion to clarify the
tionship of the present work to other work (line 702).
the solo-3 nm step-size pathway. Figure 6 (original Figure 8) was modified in response to the referee
ments. The solo-3 nm step-size pathway was originally shown to have an unproductive 5 nm lever-
swing due to temporary detachment from actin. The revised version shows an unproductive 5 nm
r-arm swing due to the myosin slipping (moving backward on actin) without detachment. Actomyosin
page in this context was observed previously as indicated in the revised manuscript (line 561).

paper supports the finding that the myosin motor is autonomous by drawing on previous work
wing mechanical characteristics of single cardiac myosins functioning in vivo (while other myosins
impelling the actin and in the presence of the other sarcomeric proteins) for comparison with results
e indicating mechanical characteristics of single cardiac myosins functioning in vitro (while no other
osins are impelling the actin filament and in the absence of the sarcomere). The principal message that
motor is autonomous is uncomplicated. The revised manuscript better emphasizes the principal
sage with a succinct description of the results.

here are no clear unitary step sizes of wild and other type of myosin shown in Figure 3. What
ogram was obtained at changing the velocity (vu)? How was the significance of step size determined
aried velocities (vu)? The three unitary step-sizes are unreliable at the present manuscript.
nt- velocity histograms in Figure 3 have evident discrete unitary-myosin actin-translating step events
ted at positions indicated with single red (~3 nm) , green (~5 nm), and blue arrows (~8 nm). Several
ary steps in combination (indicated with two arrows) at higher velocity are separate unitary steps
urring during one sampling interval (<U+F0F3>t). Discrete unitary step events are superposed on a smooth
eline from multiple actin bound myosins under various loads due to their simultaneous actin binding

Independent motion by the Qdot bound to an immobilized actin filament is the baseline (low red
d lines in Fig 3) that is subtracted from the event-velocity histogram curve (the difference curve is
wn by the solid square symbols). The difference curve is simulated to estimate the total event-velocity
ogram (solid line compared to solid squares including unitary events and the effect of ensemble
osin), the unitary step-size, and step-frequency as described in the manuscript and previously [2].

Qdot assay quantitation of cardiac myosin unitary step characteristics is firmly established having
demonstrated the significance of the cardiac ELC N-terminus actin binding on unitary step-size [2,
he significance of RLC phosphorylation on myosin unitary mechanics [4], and the mechanism for the
ct of a specific cardiac myosin drug modulator on unitary myosin mechanical characteristics [5].
Qdot assay derived step-size and step-frequency characteristics are remarkably reliably
roducible from native cardiac and skeletal myosins (porcine, mouse [2], and zebrafish [6])
s providing the contrast to surmise the impact of protein mutation [2] or other modifications
5]. Our original findings that cardiac myosin lever-arm swing partitions into three step-sizes
m two sub-steps [3] and the mechanism underlying this phenomena [2] has been
ependently verified [7, 8].
he definition of the unitary step-size is the displacement (power stroke distance) per ATP molecules
rolysis driven by single molecules of motor protein (equations 8-13). The displacements of actin
ments driven by myosin assemble in an in vitro motility were generated by detachment of positively
negatively loaded myosin, detachment of loaded alpha-actinin and reverse reaction of power stroke
2
ell as the power stroke of myosin. These displacements were not distinguishable from that of the
er stroke in the motility assay.
<U+F061>-actinin/actin detachment/attachment does not actively produce movement (they are not ATPases)
lying the “step-size” will be stochastic (unlike myosin with step-size dependent on lever arm
ensions). Average <U+F061>-actinin “step-size” is equal to the time <U+F061>-actinin spends detached from actin (<U+F074>off)
es average actin motility velocity. The <U+F061>-actinin actin binding rate, 1/<U+F074>off = kA (<U+F078> [<U+F061>]}3/2 10-3 NA-1 s-1

rage displacement of 32 nm that is unlikely to complicate measurements of the myosin step-size.
er [<U+F061>] produces a longer average displacement. Furthermore, we observe constant step-sizes and no
arent dependence on ensemble motility velocity consistent with their underlying dependence on
osin dimensions. The contribution of <U+F061>-actinin binding/detachment to step-size is ignorable.
Other effects due to multiple actin bound myosins make up the smooth baseline that is estimated
distinguished from the discrete unitary myosin motor steps by simulation. The latter is discussed in
rebuttal to point 1.
is known that multiple myosin molecules generate power strokes cooperatively (Huxley &Simmons
ure 1971, Kaya et al Nat. Comm. 2017). In the cooperative action, the step sizes driven by multiple
sin molecules are not simple summation of step size driven by single molecule because the myosin
elasticity and force changed the reaction rate. In the manuscript, the elasticity of myosin and non-
arity of step size summation were not assumed in the calculation.
are aware that myosins in a muscle fiber can be synchronized by rapid length changes [9] and that a
osin filament with multiple heads bound to an actin filament is reported to coordinate their force
eration [10]. Myosin is also thought to be a stochastic force producer propelling actin with force
portional to the number bound [11]. All are consistent with an autonomous myosin that responds to the
umstances (single myosin interacting with actin up to multiple myosins interacting with one actin
ment) without requiring hierarchical coordination with the sarcomere. In the Qdot assay, discrete steps
rded at the lowest velocity end of the event-velocity histogram are unitary and represent single
osin interactions with actin while multiple actomyosin interactions contribute the smooth baseline
ove the baseline from independent Qdot movement). We previously provided and discussed the
ence that single ventricular myosins propel actin under unloaded conditions in the Qdot assay (see
gle Myosins Propel Actin in Results section of [2]). The discussion is the same for this case except
under load we could expect myosin detachment rate to decrease [8] to lower the fraction of unitary
s observed in the event-velocity histogram. Nonetheless, the characteristic unitary impulsion is readily
tified and quantitated. We find load does not affect step-size significantly but rather shifts the step-
distribution to favor the shorter step-size.
he purified mutant myosin contained both wild and mutant myosin (Fig. 1). This makes an
rpretation of experimental result very difficult (equations 14-17). The homo-dimer of mutant myosin is
ngly recommended to use. We recognized that protein mixtures present a more complex problem and
ntitatively addressed its impact on results as indicated in Table 1 and Fig S2. Overall the expression
ls were very favorable and these complications were managed without compromise.

blem 4 is about the heterogeneous expressed protein samples. We recognized that protein
tures present a complex problem and quantitatively addressed its impact on results as
icated in Table 1 and Fig S2. Inhomogeneity in the myosin expression caused us to apply
hods introduced by Cuda et al. [1] to interpret mixed myosin motility under load (see
thods lines 352 to 439 on pages 19-23). Using this approach we managed to measure
emble myosin elasticity for each species as shown in Figure 10. Overall, the expression levels
e very favorable and these complications were managed without compromise.
remaining Problems 1-3 are summarized in two points: (i) the referee disputes our assertion
the discrete steps recorded at the lowest velocity end of the event-velocity histogram are
tary and represent single myosin interactions with actin while multiple actomyosin
ractions contribute a smooth baseline that we estimate and remove, and, (ii) what is the
act of binding and dissociation of <U+F061>-actinin on the Qdot assay step-size measurements.
address point (i) we include an Authentication section in the Methods discussing how single
osins impel actin in the Qdot assay (see Methods lines 185 to 194 on page 10).
address point (ii) we include an <U+F061>-actinin attachment/detachment effect on myosin step-size
tion in the Methods. Expected average “step-size” contributed by the attachment/detachment
<U+F061>-actinin to actin is <U+F074>32 nm and distinct from the myosin step-size (see Methods lines 317 to

in occurs in fast-twitch and slow-twitch skeletal muscles as well as in cardiac muscle, while
is found only in fast-twitch skeletal muscle. Both ELCs, A1 and A3 are products of the same
e, MYL1 located on chromosome 2q32.1-qter, differing only at the amino (N) terminal region
to a differential splicing event and the use of distinct promoters [2-4]. Mouse and human
tricular myosin essential light chain (ELC), encoded by the MYL3 gene (UniProtKB -
590), exclusively occurs in the long isoform containing the ~43 amino acid N-terminal
ension. All of our ELC’s are full length with the extended ELC N-terminus.
C isoform content in myosin changes during development affecting shortening speed in the
n in vitro motility assay [5]. It suggests the relative content of the A1 and A3 isoforms in
letal myosin adapt myosin function to its application.
he use of the term "autonomous" in describing myosin needs a clearer definition. Myosin is
eiving input from a variety of external sources that modify its behavior. How is that
onomous?
onomous in the standard sense of acting independently or self-determined. Myosin uses two
edded regulatory mechanisms to decide the step-size appropriate for the situation. It does not
d the sarcomere. Hence findings from loaded in vitro motility are applicable to the myosin in
heart.
he observed differences in step sizes (3 nm, 5 nm, 8 nm) is highly reminiscent of the
viously reported stepwise shortening of the sarcomere (Pollack et al., "Sarcomere shortening
triated muscle occurs in stepwise fashion." Nature 268:757-759 and subsequent publications
this topic) in which 2-3 nm quanta of stepsize variations were detected, but never fully
lained. Could the authors comment on the possible relationship of their work to this previous
rature?
difficult to assign a muscle mechanism giving rise to the observation. A recent paper from
line of research attributes the fundamental step-size (2.7 nm) to the linear repeat of actin
nomers in F-actin [6]. The observations are from whole sarcomeres and would require a high
ree of cooperativity over many actin and myosin filaments. The latter is a steep challenge for
mechanism to explain. The actin inchworm mechanism suggested by Yakovenko et al.
ms to be ruled out by the inverted motility assay where myosin filaments move over actin
d to the surface [7].

he figure legends should clearly indicate which data are from simulations and which are
m motility assay measurements.
revised the figure captions to distinguish experimental data from simulation.
he forces plotted in Figure 7 seem to be too high for 1000 nm actin filament lengths. A
osin head generates 3-4 pN (Finer et al., "Single myosin mechanics: piconewton forces and
ometre steps." 368:113-9) and given the repeat distance of an actin filament of about 40 nm,
re are at most about 1000 nm/40nm = 25 myosins bound at one time, an upper limit of nearly
x 4 pN = 100 pN seems likely. Please clarify.
re-checked the numbers and force values in Figure 7 are correct.
cording to the results in two papers from Moore’s group, the isometric forces can be 490-2200
[8] and 1396-2736 pN [9] in different cases. The isometric forces in our paper are 373-699
(Rhodamine data were used in fitting). Our and their forces are in the same range (the length
ctin filaments in Moore’s two papers were not given, but we guess that it is 3.1 <U+F06D>m according
he paper describing the model. The actin length is 1 <U+F06D>m in our paper.
hough Greenberg and Moore’s model can give the force in real units (pN), the model is
ited to comparing difference in isometric force between isoforms rather than giving the
olute value of the force because the parameters in eq. 3 are approximate. For example, system
pliance, <U+F06B>, associated with <U+F061>-actinin ranges from 0.7~1.7 pN/nm [8] (we used 1.7), which
rs Ff in eq. 4 by a factor of 2.4 due to only one parameter.
re is another thing. Values for force in Figure 7 are a little higher than the forces in Figure 9.
reason is that the force in Figure 7 is from Qdot labeled actin data and the force in Figure 9
rom Rhodamine labeled actin data. Because the velocities of Qdot actin filaments are higher
n those of Rhodamine actin filaments at same [<U+F061>-actinin] and friction is proportional to
ocity, the forces in Qdot case are higher than those of Rhodamine case.
noted in the manuscript that constants in eqs. 2 & 3 (except NA) are estimates. They
oduce errors affecting absolute but not relative force-velocity estimates (see lines 213-217,
e 11).
