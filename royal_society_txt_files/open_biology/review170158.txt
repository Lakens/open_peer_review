Sarell et al. report on the interactions between Abeta oligomers and the prion protein using
established cell culture models of prion disease. This work supports previous findings that Abeta
can bind to the PrPc protein and adds to this knowledge by indicating that this inhibits prion
propagation. The authors also demonstrate that this mechanism is specific to defined species of
Abeta (“oligomers”) and PrP (cellular). The experiments are well done. The conclusions are
warranted but based on in vitro data (incl synthetic Abeta known to be much less active
compared to brain-derived Abeta). The latter diminishes somewhat the importance of the work.
Comments:
1. Methodology for Fig. 5B seems crude. Can an interaction really be detected by such analysis? Is
there a positive control?
2. It is unclear why BSA was used as a control in some experiments (is this a relevant protein?).
Was BSA incubated in F12 media and characterized by AFFFF? It would seem that the most
relevant comparisons are ADDLs to monomers and fibrils in each experiment (Fig 2, 3C, 6 this is
missing).
3. The purity of Abeta fibrils and ADDL should be indicated after the generation in F12 media
(media “impurities” entering experiments?). Should monomers not also be prepared in F12 and
snap frozen for later use in experiments?

Sarell and colleagues explore the potential relationship between Aß oligomers and Prion
infection. It has been reported by these and others that Aß oligomers bind to PrPC. PrPC is of
course the substrate for templated misfolding to PrPSc during prion infection. The authors ask if
these molecular processes are competitive. They show that ADDL forms of synthetic Aß, but not
Aß monomers or Aß fibrils, inhibit cellular prion infection. Moreover, in chronically infected
cells, ADDL “cure” infection. Cellular binding data are consistent with this being due to Aß
oligomer binding to PrPC but not PrPSc. The authors suggest that Aß pathology in elderly
populations may limit risk of CJD by this mechanism. The data are clear and the ability of Aß
oligomers to inhibit Prion injection is novel and important. The authors could a few points more
fully.
1. The authors should comment J Neuroscience 30:4528-4535. In that study Prion infection was
more rapid in APP transgenic mice, opposite to the effects reported here. There are many
differences, but these should be discussed.
2. The inhibition of prion infection is observed with synthetic ADDL at relatively high
concentrations. This raises the issue of whether human AD brain has relevant levels of Aß
oligomer for this effect. At least one of the authors has shown that TBS extracts of human AD
autopsy brain (but not control brain) inhibit LTP. If such extracts are added to cellular prion
infections, as in Fig 2 or Fig 3, does the AD brain extract have any effect to limit or cure prion
infectivity? IOf so this would greatly strengthen the authors’ hypothesis.
3. Binding of ADDL to PrPC is clear. The lack of binding to PrPSc is assessed by EM of prion
rods in Fig. 5B. Here, the authors might provide biochemical assays. If the RML prion rods are
mixed with ADDL, they could pellet the rods by centrifugation and wash several times and then
assess “bound” ADDL by immunoblot.

September 26, 2017.
Sarell et al. Manuscript RSOB-17-0158
Dear Open Biology team,
Thank you for your letter of August 22. We are delighted that our manuscript has been accepted for publication in Open
Biology and we thank the reviewers for their generous praise and suggestions for minor changes. We have modified our
manuscript as detailed in your letter and below we have provided a point-by-point response to the Reviewer’s critiques.
Sincerely,
Dominic M. Walsh & John Collinge
Response to Referees
Referee: 1
Point 1: Methodology for Fig. 5B seems crude. Can an interaction really be detected by such analysis? Is there a positive
control?
Response 1: The weight of evidence from Figure 5A and Figure 6 strongly support our conclusion that ADDLs bind to
PrPc, but we agree that this experiment in Figure 5B is rather crude and by no means completely excludes the possibility
of ADDL binding to PrPsc. Accordingly, we have revised the text on page 15 to make our conclusion a little more
conservative and to suggest future studies should look at this issue.
Point 2: It is unclear why BSA was used as a control in some experiments (is this a relevant protein?). Was BSA
incubated in F12 media and characterized by AFFFF? It would seem that the most relevant comparisons are ADDLs to
monomers and fibrils in each experiment (Fig 2, 3C, 6 this is missing).
Response 2: BSA was used to account for non-specific effects of adding a significant amount of protein. As the reviewer
rightly points out the results shown in Figure 4 provide the most relevant control: Aß monomer and Aß fibrils.
Point 3: The purity of Abeta fibrils and ADDL should be indicated after the generation in F12 media (media “impurities”
entering experiments?). Should monomers not also be prepared in F12 and snap frozen for later use in experiments?
Response 3: This information has been added to page 7 of the Materials and Methods.
Point 4: Page 6, 3rd last line: “1,6,00 g” should be “16,000 g”
Response 4: We have corrected this error
Referee: 2
Point 1: The authors should comment J Neuroscience 30:4528-4535. In that study Prion infection was more rapid in APP
transgenic mice, opposite to the effects reported here. There are many differences, but these should be discussed.
Response 1: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this omission and have addressed this issue in the Discussion on
page 17-18.
Point 2: The inhibition of prion infection is observed with synthetic ADDL at relatively high concentrations. This raises
the issue of whether human AD brain has relevant levels of Aß oligomer for this effect. At least one of the authors has
shown that TBS extracts of human AD autopsy brain (but not control brain) inhibit LTP. If such extracts are added to
cellular prion infections, as in Fig 2 or Fig 3, does the AD brain extract have any effect to limit or cure prion infectivity?
IOf so this would greatly strengthen the authors’ hypothesis.
Response 2: This is an interesting suggestion, however, the addition of human brain extracts to culture cells often leads
to bacterial contamination which compromises our bioassays. We are currently working to resolve this hurdle, but such
experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript.
Point 3. Binding of ADDL to PrPC is clear. The lack of binding to PrPSc is assessed by EM of prion rods in Fig. 5B. Here, the
authors might provide biochemical assays. If the RML prion rods are mixed with ADDL, they could pellet the rods by
centrifugation and wash several times and then assess “bound” ADDL by immunoblot.
Response 3: As indicated in our response to Referee 1’s first comment, we have added text to page 15 to address this
point.
