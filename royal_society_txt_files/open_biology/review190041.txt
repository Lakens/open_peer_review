The review by Palazzo et al. details the current knowledge on the disease connections of ADP-
ribosylation signaling. The review is well written, easy to understand and provides a valuable
source of the scientific reports that establish the role of ADP-ribosylation in various human
diseases.
The authors do not specifically spell out but the review focuses on the enzymes involved in ADP-
ribosylation metabolism. There is probably only one exception: GDAP2, which has not been
associated with either generating or degrading ADP-ribose. The 7.4 GDAP2 section is quite short
and I wonder if other ADP-ribose readers associated with disease could be mentioned there, such
as the macro histones and Alc1.
Regarding disease and in particular the hope of alleviating it, the therapeutic potential through
targeting the players of ADP-ribosylation signaling could be discussed. Especially the review of
the current status of developing selective small-molecules and the potential challenges based on
the known structures and available inhibitors of the enzymes to be targeted would be a nice
addition.
A table detailing the proteins and the associated diseases with references would be a great help
for the reader looking for specific questions.
In section 7.6, it is written that the fold and catalytic mechanism of ARH3 are completely different
from PARG. While there are several original publications to support such statement, authors
could briefly mention some information they find important, such as how that translates to
similarities and differences in function or the potential for their therapeutic targeting.
Minor comments on typos:
P2L19 “transferred onto on nucleic” omit “on”
P5L24 “The member 1 of the mammalian PARPs” does not read well, please rephrase.
P7L32 “ characterized by; aggregation” omit semi-colon.

P9L25 Inflammatory bowel disease is a type of colitis, I suggest omitting “colitis”.
P9L26 Not all mentioned are causes but also manifestations. Infection, ischemia and allergic
reactions are causes the others not.
P10L4 “Alkylating” instead of “alkylation”
P10L33 Could authors rephrase “passing though”?

This excellent review will no doubt be well-received by anyone interested in a comprehensive yet
concise summary of disease-relevant functions of ADP-ribosylation. The manuscript refers to
numerous recent studies, covers a wide range of enzymes in different systems, including bacterial
toxins/antitoxins and touches upon the function of ADP-ribosylation in viral infection. I enjoyed
reading this unique manuscript and would be happy to see it published in Open Biology.
I have a number of suggestions for revising the manuscript.
Major points:
- The inhibition of DNA-dependent PARP enzymes (most notably PARP1) in BRCA-deficient
cancers is not discussed. This is certainly one of the most tangible successes in targeting PARPs in
the clinic. Mechanistic insights are being gained: trapped PARP1 on DNA breaks appear to be the
toxic lesion initiating synthetic lethality. I think it is rather important to discuss this. If the authors
would like to limit the discussion, they can refer the reader to other excellent reviews on the
topic.
- The field suffers from a somewhat clumsy nomenclature, even referring to mono-ADP-
ribosyltransferases as PARPs. (See also Figure 1: the term "mono-PARP" is contradictory in itself.)
The review would be an opportunity to use a nomenclature that is clearer to the outsider. Many
authors prefer the old, inconsistent nomenclature for historic reasons, but this may impair clarity
for readers not yet familiar with the PARP field. This will be the authors' call.
- p.9, paragraph 1: There is an apparent contradition, or at least a potential source for
4
misunderstanding. In line 7, the authors state that "inhibition of Tankyrases does not alter the
overall formation of SGs". In contrast, in lines 10 and 11, the authors point out that PARP
inhibition "reduces the accumulation of TDP-43 ...". Are SGs still being observed?
- Two major incentives for targeting the tankyrase proteins by small molecule inhibitors are to
control their function in canonical Wnt signalling (for example related to colorectal cancer) and
glucose homeostasis (related to diabetes). Can the authors either briefly discuss these aspects or
refer the reader to other reviews? Tankyrase has also gained attention through its roles in
telomere length maintenance. A few more words on this aspect, which is also relevant to disease
mechanisms, would be welcomed.
- I think the following study deserves to be discussed in the context of tankyrase, in particular
since neurobiology already features prominently in the review: Fancy et al. (2011) Axin2 as
regulatory and therapeutic target in newborn brain injury and remyelination. Nat. Neurosci. 14,
1009–1016.
- p. 12, paragraph 3: Tankyrase appears to impinge on a wide range of functions and have many
interaction partners and substrates. The sheer number of binders/substrates, illustrated by
references 160 and 150, should be referred to. Also, another study worth adding in this context is
the following: Li et al. (2017) Proteomic Analysis of the Human Tankyrase Protein Interaction
Network Reveals Its Role in Pexophagy. Cell Reports 20, 737–749.
- p. 12, line 8: Functions of tankyrase in HR-mediated DNA damage repair and Notch signalling
are fairly recent discoveries. Therefore, it may be a bit premature to talk about "crucial roles". This
may well be the case, but without a deeper mechanistic understanding, I recommend caution in
the wording. Among the best understood functions of tankyrase are canonical Wnt signalling,
telomere length maintenance and roles in mitosis.
- p. 12, line 13: Many tankryase-binding motifs in fact are octapeptides, as informed by peptide
permutation studies (see reference 160). The consensus has also been determined in greater detail
than RxxPDG (also see reference 160). Also, "non-canonical" motifs with an N-terminally
displaced arginine residue are emerging (see DaRosa et al., Protein Sci, 2018 vol 27). Having said
that, the particular motif in 3BP2 is indeed an example for a hexapeptide as the residue at
position 8 makes minimal contributions to binding.
- p. 12, line 20: Whether PTEN is a direct tankyrase binder or substrate is still not clear.
- p. 12, paragraph 3: Although the PAR-dependent ubiquitination pathway is ubiquitous, many
tankyrase binders do not become PARylated or destabilised (e.g., MCL1, GMD). The mechanistic
basis for this observation is not known. The sentence in lines 21 and 22 should therefore be
revised accordingly.
Minor points / stylistic suggestions / typos:
- The abbreviation ADPr is used for both ADP-ribosylation and ADP-ribose in the article. A
disambiguation would be desirable.
- Abstract (p. 1): "The control of the ADPr network is vital, and dysregulation ..."
- Abstract (p. 1): "... acquired human diseases, such as several neuological disorders ..."
- p. 2, line 7: This is a conceptual point: cellular mechanisms do not evolve for a purpose;
evolution is not purpose-directed.
- p. 2, line 8: "dynamically regulate protein function through chemical modification." - You do not
need the word "structure" here.
- p. 2, line 32 and elsewhere (p.9, line 20): talking of "cure" is very strong. This could, for example,
be exchanged by "available therapy".
- p. 3, line 27: "paragraph thirteen" - indicating the section would suffice as readers may not want
to count paragraphs.
- p. 3, line 32: "extracellular"
- p. 6, line 9: "Ser-ADPr targets include ..."
- p. 6, line 10: "has been found linked to factors mediating RNA processing, chromatin
modification, splicing, ..."
- p.6, line 26: "... which involves the production ..."
5
- p. 6, line 29: "Similar observatiuons were made ..."
- p. 6, line 30 & 31: "Moreover, PARP1 activation was shown in [...] patients who died of stroke,
..."
- p. 7, line 7: I suggest saying "We next describe the role of PARP1 activation ..."
- p. 7, line 32: "... which is characterized by aggregation ..."
- p.8, line 34: The sentence commencing with "In turn, nuclear PAR aids the translocation ..." is
unclear. Can the mechanism be described somewhat more extensively?
- p. 10, line 14: "... are encoded in the human genome ..."
- p. 10, line 25: The sentence "PARP9 is recruited at the DNA damage foci ..." is unclear.
- p. 10, line 32: Likewise, the sentence "It should be noted that the oncogenic potential ..." can be
written in a clearer way.
- p. 11, line 13: "... which also is a substrate of PARP14 ..."
- p. 11, line 28: "When secreted into the extracellular environment [...] and, in addition, facilitates
angiogenesis ..."
- p. 12, line 28: "tankyrase substrates"
- p. 13, line 17: "OADPr" hasn't been defined.
- p. 14, line 17: "among them the MacroD2 gene"
- p. 14, line 21: "250 kilobase"
- p. 14, line 24: "It is worth mentioning ..."
- p. 14, line 25: I suggest separating the sentence and have the second sentence start with "Thus,
more observations are needed to explore ..." (rather than "establish")
- p. 14, line 33: "Importantly, some MacroD2 somatic mutations ..."
- p. 15, line 7: "... phophate- [or phospho-]linked ADPr [...] [44, 47, 188, 189]"
- p. 15, line 24: The logic of the sentence "Nonetheless, the accumulation of peptides ..." is unclear.
- p. 16, line 2: "Differently from TARG1, MacroD1 and MacroD2, ..."
- p. 16, line 13: "... have not been directly linked ..."
- p. 16, line 20: "... die at the embryonic stage; however, when grown at a permissive temperature,
survival is increased."
- p. 16, line 27: "PARG functions have also been linked ..."
- p. 17, line 10: "PARG has already been proposed ..."
- p. 17, line 10: I suggest splitting the sentence, starting the second sentence with "This would be
particularly appropriate ..."
- p. 17, line 19: one reference is formatted incorrectly (Eidhof 2018).
- p. 17, line 24: "ARH"
- p. 17, line 27: "hydrolytic activity towards N-glycosidic bonds"
- p. 17, line 30: "hepatocellular carcinoma"

- p. 20, line 11: "Pertussis toxin acts towards virtually all mammalian cell types ..."
- p. 20, line 14: ".. pathogenic mechanisms as well as the proteins substrate(s) of this toxin remain
unknown."
- p. 20, line 17: "non-polymerised form of actin"
- p. 20, line 28: "In addition, a very intriguing class of bARTTs ..."
