Comments to the Author

In this manuscript the authors discuss the oposite roles of the JNK pathway in apoptosis versus
proliferation. The authors put together the state of the art and make a valuable contribution by
analyzing different contexts and concluding that the outcome of the JNK differs when acts as
autocrine or as a paracrine signal. The manuscript is accompanied by several images that support
their conclusions. The manuscript considers a long-standing debate, which deserves much more
attention for its relevance on cell competition, compensatory proliferation, tumor growth and
hyperplasia, growth control and regeneration. Overall, this is a timely paper and deserves
publication. There are few comments and suggestions that hopefully can help to improve the
present version.
The authors describe the dual function of JNK, which acts as paracrine and autocrine signal. I am
missing any possible mechanism that could explain how JNK signals reach the neighbor cells. If
the same JNK has a dual function and is produced by the same source of cells, downstream
signals of the JNK pathway should be activated, act on the neighbors (e.g. via jak stat or wg), and
then JNK activated in that nearby cell. Alternatively, the TNF Eiger should be transcriptionally
activated (somehow) and signal to neighbors. My concern is that, according to the model in
figure 1, whatever is the mechanism that JNK is reaching the nearby cells, transcriptional
activation is supposed to be involved. But transcriptional activation, especially after apoptosis or
damage, can be very important to sustain the mechanism of repair or growth, but too slow for the
initial steps. The initial responses to insults are usually fast, albeit transient, in the order of
seconds or minutes. These rapid responses include pro-inflammatory signals, which are often
triggered by calcium and ROS, and act upstream of protein modifications (e.g. phosphorylation
of JNK). In addition, some of these rapid signals are able to spread from a source to surrounding
tissue. Therefore the JNK function in proliferation could be a consequence of stressors
propagated, at least in the initial steps, rather than the paracrine JNK. There are plenty of
evidences that damage produces release of calcium, this calcium is propagated, NAPH oxidases
(Duox) activated by calcium, and these oxidases produce H2O2 that activate JNK in proliferating
cells. Thus a mechanism that propagates JNK could be scheduled as: Damage->Ca++->ROS-
>JNK->Proliferation
which has been proposed in Drosophila discs (W. Wood, P. Martin, F. Serras, M. Galko labs) .
Note that the paracrine function would be supported by the Ca++ module->ROS or alternatively,
as proposed by some, by the ROS propagation itself. Thus, initially JNK is activated in both
damaged cells and growing cells. Summarizing, the authors mention ROS and that ROS is
important for JNK activation. However they omit that the mechanism of stress-dependent JNK
activation could also explain the action of JNK in growing cells. It would be fair to consider this
issue in the manuscript, particularly that stress can act on JNK, or at least that this stress-
3
dependent JNK activation could operate in conjunction with paracrine model presented here.
This would fit in a comprehensive model in which JNK generated in tumor cells or apoptotic cells
creates a stress environment that when propagated, cells respond by activating JNK or enhancing
JNK activity.
Minor comments
Page 4. This sentence should be in the previous paragraph: ‘The mechanism by which Dronc
activates or stimulates JNK (37, 38) is not known’.
Page 6 first sentence: ‘ X-ray-damaged tissue can compensate in absence of the mitogenic signals
Wg and Dpp from apoptotic cells (7).’ In the way it is written one can conclude that Wg and Dpp
are not involved in compensatory proliferation. This contradicts other parts of the manuscript,
where the authors comment that wg is involved in growth. It has been demonstrated that Wg is a
key signal for growth; an enhancer of wg is activated in tumors and regeneration in a JNK-
dependent manner (Hariharan, Schubiger). Moreover, tumor growth dependent of JNK has been
shown to act via Wg (Milan. Dekanty et al., 2012. Moreover, in the absence of that wg enhancer,
discs do not regenerate and tumor growth diminishes. These points could be clarified.
Page 6 the sentence ‘Although it was discovered in cells in which the apoptosis program was
active, the paracrine capacity to stimulate cell proliferation is an intrinsic property of JNK that
does not depend on apoptosis. Sustained JNK activity in apoptosis-deficient cells also causes
excessive proliferation (7, 25).’
Again this could be dependent on stress signals, as mentioned above. Sustained activity of JNK
could result in sustained activation of caspases, which in turn, result in high stress, affecting
mitochondria and generating high oxidative stress. Can the authors discard that the short range
signal (paracrine) is amplified because stress can propagate to neighbors?.
Page 6. About the sentence: ‘The paracrine function is normally inconsequential because the cells
in apoptosis emitting mitogenic signals are short-lived. It is only when the apoptotic cells remain
alive, like the undead cells, or when cells lack the apoptosis machinery (7, 25), that the
consequences of the proliferative signalling become apparent’ This a good point. Indeed cell
death would prevent soon or late the paracrine signal. Therefore, for compensatory proliferation,
other signals might be important. Again, ROS and Ca, which are produced in dying and dead
cells for long periods, could be the trigger.
Page 8 top. The sentence ‘population. How this mechanism of ROSmediated
JNK activation relates to the Sas/PTP10D ligand/receptor system described
by Yamamoto et at is unclear’ could be moved to the Sas/PTP10D paragraph below of the same
page.
The ‘group protection’ concept is very intriguing and interesting. The figure is very convincing.
In fact, it can be considered a variation of the Gurdon’s community effect; why not using the term
community effect?
The JNK sustenance by mol is a mechanism to maintain the stress, but not to originate it. ROS are
primarily induced in the mitochondria. Again, ROS are produced far earlier than mol expression.
Figure 2c Clarify in the legend whether those clones, in addition to scrib-, overexpress the
phosphatase puc or are visualizing puc-GFP. This could help to general readers. Is the scale the
same as b?

The JNK signaling pathway is an important pathway conserved among metazoans. It plays an
important role in different processes such as tissue homeostasis, morphogenesis, wound healing,
immunity, programmed cell death or aging. Therefore, it presents great interest for a large panel
of readers. In this review paper, the authors present the complexity of the JNK functions in vivo
with respect to cell proliferation, competition, tumorigenesis and regeneration. Most of the paper
deals with data obtained using the Drosophila wing imaginal disc model, but the authors also
open up to the mammalian field. At the end of the review, the authors present very novel data
that compare regeneration processes in two different tissues, the notum and the appendage. They
suggest that differences between models are mediated by differing downstream signaling
pathways. I agree with the authors but it could also be partly explained by the large number of
possible kinases, adaptors and ligand/receptor combinations.
Overall, this is a nice manuscript that can be published with minor revisions (see pdf file).

Appendix A
Response to referees
We would like to thank the two referees for their positive
and constructive comments. They appreciate the value of
our manuscript in putting together the evidence indicating
the dual functions of JNK regarding apoptosis and cell
proliferation.
Both of them point out some grammatical mistakes and also
some sentences that are not sufficiently clear. They
suggest appropriate alterations that we have included in
the revised version of the manuscript
In the case of Referee 1, this person raises several
points. A major one concerning our model that JNK may
exert two distinct functions: an autocrine cell killing
activity in the cells expressing the pathway and a
paracrine pro-proliferation function affecting neighbour
cells. The referee argues about the possibility of the
paracrine signalling emanating from the JNK expressing
cells would result in JNK activation in the neighbour
cells caused by stressors (calcium, H2O2). This JNK
function might be responsible of the pro-proliferation
effect. We are aware of work indicating the JNK activity
may be propagated, via eiger or other factors. However,
the important issue is that it is the autocrine cell-
killing function of JNK what causes proliferation of
neighbour cells. Whether this is mediated by secondary
non-lethal activation of JNK is of interest but does not
affect the essence of the model: cells expressing JNK
undergo cell death themselves (autocrine effect), and also
generate signals that stimulate proliferation of neighbour
cells – a paracrine effect. Perhaps the best demonstration
of this duality comes from the regeneration experiments
reported by Martin et al Development 2017, which are also
illustrated in Figure 5c,d of our manuscript. rpr-mediated
killing of the wing cells causes over-proliferation of
their neighbour notum cells, which make a notum duplicate.
The over-proliferation and the notum duplication are
suppressed if the dying wing cells cannot activate JNK.
Thus it is the signalling emanating from JNK-expressing
dying cells that is responsible for the overgrowth of
neighbour tissue
The referee comments about a sentence of our manuscript
“X-ray-damaged tissue can compensate in absence of the
mitogenic signals Wg and Dpp from apoptotic cells” and
states “In the way it is written one can conclude that Wg
and Dpp are not involved in compensatory proliferation”
That is exactly what we wanted to conclude; that Wg and
Dpp are not involved in compensatory proliferations.
Strong evidence for this claim was published some years
ago (Perez-Garijo et al Development 2009, cited in the
reference list). Wg is certainly involved in generating
overgrowths but not in compensating for lost tissue after
irradiation.
The referee also points out our sentence “Although it was
discovered in cells in which the apoptosis program was
active, the paracrine capacity to stimulate cell
proliferation is an intrinsic property of JNK that does
not depend on apoptosis. Sustained JNK activity in
apoptosis-deficient cells also causes excessive
proliferation”
and then states
“Again this could be dependent on stress signals, as
mentioned above. Sustained activity of JNK could result in
sustained activation of caspases, which in turn, result in
high stress, affecting mitochondria and generating high
oxidative stress. Can the authors discard that the short
range signal (paracrine) is amplified because stress can
propagate to neighbors?”
The referee is in error here for in apoptosis-deficient
cells there is no caspase activity
About the “group protection” concept. As postulated by
John Gurdon, it describes a situation in which cells can
influence the determination of their neighbours. It is a
very interesting idea that we have postulated may function
during regeneration (Herrera and Morata eLife 2014).
However the group protection hypothesis describes a
mechanism by which a sufficiently large group of tumour
cells can escape cell competition because the latter is a
short-range phenomenon that only affects the periphery of
the group. Those inside are beyond the reach
