Comments to the Author

In this manuscript, Lin and colleagues present a thorough review of the state-of-the-art in the
research of how neural circuits control Drosophila feeding behavior based on their hunger state.
The strength of the review is the provided extensive overview of the current knowledge on (1)
how nutritional needs are sensed by different tissues including the brain; (2) how nutrient status
is communicated to the brain; (3) the neuromodulatory and peptidergic pathways involved in
encoding of the hunger state and; (4) how the activity of feeding circuits (from sensory neurons to
locomotor circuits) are regulated by different modulatory pathways based on the nutritional state
of the fly. They have nicely discussed our understanding of how the intake of different
macronutrients (i.e. sugar and protein) could be controlled by modulating the activity of different
sensory circuits involved in different aspects of the feeding program (e.g. modulation of olfaction
and locomotion for foraging, gustatory sensory neurons for food exploitation). They have also
mentioned higher order feeding circuits such as mushroom body and central complex. The
writing and figures are clear.
There are four major points which I would like to raise and which in my opinion could help the
authors to significantly improve the manuscript:
At this stage the comprehensiveness of the discussed players controlling feeding makes the
different parts of the review a bit difficult to read. Sometimes one feels like crossing a long desert
of facts. I think that subdividing the review in subsections would help. For example the part on
the feeding circuits could be subdivided into taste and non-taste parts. I also don’t think that the
memory part should necessarily be lumped together with olfaction. A clearer structure would
help the reader to orient themselves in the sea of facts.
A major disappointment is that while the title, abstract and the beginning of the review
emphasizes behavior, there is no further emphasis or discussion on the different behavioral
elements underlying foraging and feeding. The behavioral manifestation of the hunger state in
terms of the changes in the foraging and feeding behavior is not well discussed. A section on how
deprivation of nutrients affects foraging (e.g. Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016, Kim and Dickinson
2017) and the feeding microstructure (e.g. Itskov et al., 2014, Yapici et al., 2016) would be useful
to clarify the behavioral relevance of the neuromodulation etc.. This could also give the non-
expert reader a feeling of the behavioral approaches and assays used to mechanistically dissect
feeding and could highlight that a key challenge for the future will be to assign how the
described neuromodulators/neurons control foraging and feeding.
In general I also would suggest that the authors emphasize that what is known in larvae and
adults does not necessarily have to be the same. This is a common misconception in papers and
reviewers. I appreciated that the authors tried to always mention if data were generated in larvae
or adults but I think this could be emphasized even more. Maybe they could even emphasize that
in a specific paragraph. Also in figure 1 which I think at this stage lumps together data from
larvae and adults the authors should be careful to separate if the conclusion comes from larvae or
adults. If this is the case, maybe splitting the diagram into two like done in figure 2 would be
better.

Finally, at the beginning of the review (for example the introduction) the authors provide a lot of
general concepts and ideas about feeding, foraging, and how it is regulated. Unfortunately no
citations are provided for these generally accepted “facts”. Unfortunately, these aspects are
foundational for how we think about feeding and foraging and are unfortunately not always well
documented if at all. The authors should therefore provide citations for these initial statements.
MINOR POINTS:
Although the modulatory pathways controlling the hunger-driven behaviors are well-defined,
the neural circuits that are involved in the sensorimotor transformation are not well-discussed
(e.g. interneurons and PERin neurons previously defined by the Kristin Scott lab, Fdg command
neuron identified by Flood et al., 2013). Besides being at the core of the sensorimotor
transformations controlling foraging and feeding behaviors, these neurons are likely targets of
neuromodulation as well. It would be useful if the authors could add a paragraph discussing
these neural elements and their potential interactions with the modulatory circuits.
As a general remark I am not sure that it is always correct to call some of the molecules
“homologues” of vertebrate molecules. I think in some cases “orthologues” would be a better
choice.
poxn mutants are not taste blind as they still have internal taste organs and also taste pegs are not
affected by the mutation. In general the field has become more careful in interpreting the results
from “taste mutants” as an evidence for postingestive nutrient assessment.
As for the concluding remarks, it would be essential to speculate how important it is to study the
integrated action of different modulatory pathways control different aspects of the fly feeding
program ranging from foraging dynamics to the microstructure of food consumption.

Appendix A
Point-by-point response to reviewers
We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript. We
have followed their suggestions closely and revised the manuscript accordingly. We believe these
changes have significantly improved the manuscript. For ease of reading, our responses to
comments are provided in blue font.
There are four major points which I would like to raise and which in my opinion could help the
authors to significantly improve the manuscript:
At this stage the comprehensiveness of the discussed players controlling feeding makes the different
parts of the review a bit difficult to read. Sometimes one feels like crossing a long desert of facts. I
think that subdividing the review in subsections would help. For example, the part on the feeding
circuits could be subdivided into taste and non-taste parts. I also don’t think that the memory part
should necessarily be lumped together with olfaction. A clearer structure would help the reader to
orient themselves in the sea of facts.
We thank the reviewer for this helpful comment. We have improved the structure of the manuscript
by subdividing into subsections some parts of the review.
A major disappointment is that while the title, abstract and the beginning of the review emphasizes
behavior, there is no further emphasis or discussion on the different behavioral elements underlying
foraging and feeding. The behavioral manifestation of the hunger state in terms of the changes in
the foraging and feeding behavior is not well discussed. A section on how deprivation of nutrients
affects foraging (e.g. Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016, Kim and Dickinson 2017) and the feeding
microstructure (e.g. Itskov et al., 2014, Yapici et al., 2016) would be useful to clarify the behavioral
relevance of the neuromodulation etc. This could also give the non-expert reader a feeling of the
behavioral approaches and assays used to mechanistically dissect feeding and could highlight that a
key challenge for the future will be to assign how the described neuromodulators/neurons control
foraging and feeding.
We thank the reviewer for these valuable suggestions. We have added a new section, “Intricacy of
foraging and feeding behavior: a future challenge,” to cover these points.
In general I also would suggest that the authors emphasize that what is known in larvae and adults
does not necessarily have to be the same. This is a common misconception in papers and reviewers.
I appreciated that the authors tried to always mention if data were generated in larvae or adults but
I think this could be emphasized even more. Maybe they could even emphasize that in a specific
paragraph. Also in figure 1 which I think at this stage lumps together data from larvae and adults the
authors should be careful to separate if the conclusion comes from larvae or adults. If this is the
case, maybe splitting the diagram into two like done in figure 2 would be better.
We agree with the reviewer that it is important to distinguish whether a conclusion is based on data
from larvae or adults. However, we do think that there are many similarities between larvae and
adults in terms of neuromodulator functions. Accordingly, we still prefer to discuss larval and adult
findings together. Nevertheless, we have revised our introduction to emphasize the potential
differences in neural mechanisms between larvae and adult flies. We have further ensured that we
always categorically state if a data is from larvae or adults. We have also now labeled the citations in
Fig. 1 differently to distinguish larval and adult studies.
Finally, at the beginning of the review (for example the introduction) the authors provide a lot of
general concepts and ideas about feeding, foraging, and how it is regulated. Unfortunately no
citations are provided for these generally accepted “facts”. Unfortunately, these aspects are
foundational for how we think about feeding and foraging and are unfortunately not always well
documented if at all. The authors should therefore provide citations for these initial statements.
We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have now provided citations for these
statements.
MINOR POINTS:
Although the modulatory pathways controlling the hunger-driven behaviors are well-defined, the
neural circuits that are involved in the sensorimotor transformation are not well-discussed (e.g.
interneurons and PERin neurons previously defined by the Kristin Scott lab, Fdg command neuron

controlling foraging and feeding behaviors, these neurons are likely targets of neuromodulation as
well. It would be useful if the authors could add a paragraph discussing these neural elements and
their potential interactions with the modulatory circuits.
We have added a new subsection to cover these findings.
As a general remark I am not sure that it is always correct to call some of the molecules
“homologues” of vertebrate molecules. I think in some cases “orthologues” would be a better
choice.
We revised our manuscript to remove “homolog” where we deem it unsuitable. However, in most
cases where we have confirmed our use of this term is consistent with the literature, we have
maintained it. To our knowledge, ortholog can be included in the definition of homolog (i.e.
homologs can be subdivided into orthologs and paralogs).
poxn mutants are not taste blind as they still have internal taste organs and also taste pegs are not
affected by the mutation. In general the field has become more careful in interpreting the results
from “taste mutants” as an evidence for postingestive nutrient assessment.
We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have removed the statement about poxn
mutants.
As for the concluding remarks, it would be essential to speculate how important it is to study the
integrated action of different modulatory pathways control different aspects of the fly feeding
program ranging from foraging dynamics to the microstructure of food consumption.
We again thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion and have revised our concluding remarks
accordingly.
