Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
This manuscript successfully applies the technique of MicroCT scanning to study the structure of
direct longitudinal muscles in Drosophila, as well as in honeybee. Some new insights into muscle
structure and development are presented here, but overall this is a methodology paper. As the
authors point out, MicroCT will provide better appreciation of structure of mutant muscles in
Drosophila, as well as thoracic muscles in other insects. The main point for consideration is
whether the method will be of enough interest to warrant publication in Open Biology. If the
authors wish to convert the paper into a research report, specific hypotheses about structural
defects in mutant muscles could be tested and reported upon. At the least, questions addressed in
the manuscript as to differences in muscle volumes between the sexes and during aging could be
highlighted in the abstract and introduction, so that there is some focus on research observations
as opposed to only methodology. Below are some specific comments that could improve the
presentation:
1) References need to be added in multiple locations, e.g., “shares myofibrillar architecture with
mammalian skeletal muscles”; “Drosophila muscle developmental studies focus on larvae or
pupae”
2) The authors focus on DLMs and note that they alone share architecture with mammalian
muscle. What about DVMs? Don’t the authors mean to talk about IFMs overall? Also, some
explanation of how these muscle work to power flight would be appropriate.
3) The single paragraph sentence at the end of the Introduction needs to be better developed to
highlight the research results. The sentence prior to that should be fused with the previous
paragraph. The same for line 104.
4) How long does a scan take? What is the purpose of calculating square roots of muscle
volumes?
5) Lines 108-109: “actin bundles” are more properly called “myofibrillar bundles” or perhaps
“fascicles”?
6) Line 117: Fig. 2C-E seems to show four instances of templates failing to split, not three. Need to
explain how the rate of this defect was calculated (1:40).
7) Line 126: we devised a volume mapping [protocol]
8) Unclear what is meant by non-myofibril signal. Just the area between fascicles? What about
3
signals due to mitochondria, nuclei and intracellular membranes? Actin signal in Fig 3D is either
referring to myofibrillar signal or fascicle signal, depending on what is meant here. This should
be clarified.
9) A number of grammatical errors are sprinkled through the manuscript. Note author
capitalization or repetition errors in references 8 and 10.
10) Figure 2B caption mentions 28-day results, whereas the figure says 3 weeks. In addition to
correcting this, it is probably best to use either days or weeks in both figure and legend.

Comments to Author:
The authors make a convincing argument that new methods for analyzing muscles are needed,
and their use of MicroCT scans reveals a powerful approach to evaluate tissue in the context of
the whole organism. Their data clearly show differences in muscle volume between sexes, in part
through elegant 3D movies, and their method is applicable to another insect species, honeybee.
The impact of this work would be significantly higher, however, if the analyses included a
description of a muscle mutant.
In addition to the other issues noted by one of the reviewers, minor weaknesses that need
attention include:
1) grammar and punctuation;
2) justification for measurements to two decimal places (not warranted by the standard
deviations);
3) in Fig 1B, is anterior down; are we seeing antennae?
4) minor annotation on the movies to show features.

Subject: Submission of revised Manuscript
Dear Editor,
The authors of this study are very happy to have received your referees’ comments on our
manuscript. They were constructive and we believe they have led to an improved paper. We
have addressed each comment specifically. In the following pages, you’ll find that the text of
each specific comment from the reviewers has been changed to red an our response that
describes consequent changes to the manuscript is in blue. We sincerely hope that these
revisions are to your satisfaction.
This manuscript was intended to illustrate the power of using MicroCT scanning for
analysing muscles in insects. These novel anatomical observations correlated with
Drosophila ageing couldn’t have satisfactorily been made otherwise. In rewriting the
manuscript we have tried to make it hypothesis driven, as Reviewer 1 suggested. We are
convinced that this method and these findings stand on their own, irrespective of our
success in converting the original submission to a hypothesis driven paper. We hope that
you agree.
We deeply appreciate the quick turn around on our submission. If there is any other
information that we need to furnish, we would be happy to provide it.
Sincerely,
Dhananjay Chaturvedi

Comments to Author:
The authors make a convincing argument that new methods for analyzing muscles are
needed, and their use of MicroCT scans reveals a powerful approach to evaluate tissue in
the context of the whole organism. Their data clearly show differences in muscle volume
between sexes, in part through elegant 3D movies, and their method is applicable to
another insect species, honeybee. The impact of this work would be significantly higher,
however, if the analyses included a description of a muscle mutant.
We are grateful to the Board member for recognizing the need and scope of MicoCT
scanning of Drosophila muscles. Through figure 4, Video 4 and its associated result
description, we have added a small analysis of the Indirect Flight Muscle phenotypes
mutations in the Sphingosine Lyase gene. This mutation and its effects on Drosophila DLMs
have been previously described (Pantoja et. al. Development. 2013). This permits for a
direct comparison between traditional methods and ours. A full aging analysis on these
mutants would prove impractical, given the viability of these mutants and the scope of this
study.
In addition to the other issues noted by one of the reviewers, minor weaknesses that need
attention include:
1) grammar and punctuation;
The revised manuscript has been checked for spelling and grammar.
2) justification for measurements to two decimal places (not warranted by the standard
deviations);
We thank the review for this comment. The least count in our measurements is above 1<U+F06D>3
and they range from the fifth to the 7th order of magnitude. Therefore, we have rounded off
volume and standard deviation measurements to the nearest whole number.
3) in Fig 1B, is anterior down; are we seeing antennae?
Fig1B. schematizes the positioning of DLMs inside the thorax. In the legend for this figure,
we have described the Top view as: “In Top view, DLMs (Green) run along the A-P (red
dotted line, arrowhead indicates anterior ‘A’) inside the thorax, under the cuticle.” To
illustrate this positioning to the reader, the head with eyes and antennae are shown. We
hope this, in addition to the labelling, communicates to the reader that this is in fact, the
top view of the animal with the anterior side to the left, and therefore the posterior to the
right of the page.
4) minor annotation on the movies to show features.
All uploaded videos are now annotated to guide the viewer. They highlight structures that
we’d like to draw the viewer’s attention to.

and introduction, so that there is some focus on research observations as opposed to only
methodology.
We thank the reviewer for suggesting these changes. The abstract, introduction and
discussion have been extensively modified bearing this comment in mind.
Below are some specific comments that could improve the presentation:
1) References need to be added in multiple locations, e.g., “shares myofibrillar architecture
with mammalian skeletal muscles”; “Drosophila muscle developmental studies focus on
larvae or pupae”
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added more references as appropriate.
The manuscript now provides better context to our findings.
2) The authors focus on DLMs and note that they alone share architecture with mammalian
muscle. What about DVMs? Don’t the authors mean to talk about IFMs overall? Also, some
explanation of how these muscle work to power flight would be appropriate.
This description has been added to the introduction.
3) The single paragraph sentence at the end of the Introduction needs to be better
developed to highlight the research results. The sentence prior to that should be fused with
the previous paragraph. The same for line 104.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The two sentences indicated by the reviewer
have been fused to previous paragraphs.
4) How long does a scan take? What is the purpose of calculating square roots of muscle
volumes?
Each scan takes forty minutes. This information has been added to the MicroCT scanning
section under materials and methods.
The reason for calculating square roots of the volume lies in the design of the volume
mapping protocol. We wanted to represent the magnitude of volume (3D) through the area
of a square (2D). So, if a square of side length ‘s’ represents a volume ‘V’
s2 =bV
where ‘b’ is a constant of appropriate units, the length ‘s’, of the side of the representative
square, is square root of bV. Because these volume measurements are normalized to the
smallest measurement, the constant ‘b’ cancels out. This clarification is very warranted and
so has been added to the manuscript in the Data processing and volume calculation section
under Materials and Methods.
5) Lines 108-109: “actin bundles” are more properly called “myofibrillar bundles” or perhaps
“fascicles”?
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. “actin bundles” have been changed to
“myofibrillar bundles”.
6) Line 117: Fig. 2C-E seems to show four instances of templates failing to split, not three.
Need to explain how the rate of this defect was calculated (1:40).
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this possible source of confusion. To clarify that
statement, we’ve amended the text as below.
“…we show three animals where templates failed to split during pupariation. These were
found among a total of 131 animals scanned for this study. Therefore the background rate
of this specific defect in muscle development in our wildtype stock is around 1 in 40
animals.”
7) Line 126: we devised a volume mapping [protocol]
This correction has been made in line 126 and 130 of the original submission. The title of
Figure 2 has been amended in the same spirit.
8) Unclear what is meant by non-myofibril signal. Just the area between fascicles? What
about signals due to mitochondria, nuclei and intracellular membranes? Actin signal in Fig
3D is either referring to myofibrillar signal or fascicle signal, depending on what is meant
here. This should be clarified.
Based on comparisons with phalloidin staining of DLM preps, and that iodine is taken up by
myofibrils, we are confident, that the signal we are seeing in our scans is associated with
myofibrils. To highlight this, we have moved the sentence “Iodine uptake by myofibrils has
previously demonstrated (6).” from the Materials and methods to the second paragraph in
the first result section.
Since we are not absolutely certain what the remaining muscle volume is occupied by, we
have stated the following in the next paragraph “This suggests that regions with signal
below threshold, are non-sarcomeric muscle components between fascicles. This
arrangement is consistent. We speculate these non-sarcomeric regions may consist of
proteins that define the fascicles, such as those usually present in the extracellular matrix
and/or lipids in addition to nuclei, mitochondria and intracellular membranes. Since we
have not categorically demonstrated what this volume consists of, we continue to refer to it
as non-sarcomeric regions or volume.” To avoid confusion, “Actin bundles” labeled next to
the green box in Fig.3D has been changed to “Myofibril signal”.
9) A number of grammatical errors are sprinkled through the manuscript. Note author
capitalization or repetition errors in references 8 and 10.
We attended to all such errors in this manuscript. We thank the reviewer for their attention
to detail.
10) Figure 2B caption mentions 28-day results, whereas the figure says 3 weeks. In addition
to correcting this, it is probably best to use either days or weeks in both figure and legend.
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error in figure-making. It has been duly
corrected.
