Chu et al have demonstrated that the IL-38 plays an inhibitory role in NSCLC development and
function as a novel prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target, which is interesting
and important for this field. However, there are some concerns that the authors should address
them carefully.
1) Full name for "CI" in table 2-3
2) Use box and whiskers plots for data presentation in Figure 1A and Figure 4A, 4B.
3) Repeat some important findings on at least one newly isolated cancer cell line.
4) The physiological and pathological concentration of IL-38 (Figure 1B) is much less than the
concentration the authors used for in vitro studies (Figure 2 and 3). Does this mean that the
authors misinterpreted the data as too high IL-38 concentration used.
5) Show some representative figures for Figure 4A and 4B

The authors conducted the present study to investigate the effects of IL-38, a newly identified
anti-inflammatory factor, on NSCLC, and showed that overexpression of IL-38 in NSCLC cells
suppressed cell migration, invasion, proliferation, colony formation through suppressing ß-
catenin. The results of this study indicated that IL-38 plays an inhibitory role in NSCLC
development and functions as a novel prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target.
Overall, the manuscript is of definite interest to the readers and is of moderate impact for the
biology of NSCLC, but I have some concerns about this manuscript.
1. The authors examined the association between IL-38 expression and patient characteristics. In
this study, a total of 384 patients with surgically resected NSCLC were enrolled, but Table 1
showed that this study included the patients with stage IV disease. Why did this study include
the patients with stage IV disease? Moreover, we couldn’t know the information about the
histology (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma), smoking history, and the presence of
pleural and lymphatic invasion. Please show me the patient characteristics in more detailed and
re-examine the association between IL-38 expression and patient characteristics.
2. The authors evaluated IL-38 expression in NSCLC by immunohistochemistry, but I could know
little information about the expression pattern of IL-38, for example, membrane of tumor cells or
cytoplasm of tumor cells and the presence of heterogeneity. Please show me the representative
images of no expression, weak expression, and strong expression of IL-38.
3. In vitro study, the authors used two human NSCLC cell lines A549 and SK-MES-1. Why did
you use this two cell lines? Why didn’t you use the other NSCLC cell lines?
4. In vitro study, the authors investigated the role of IL-38 in NSCLC development, cell migration,
invasion, apoptosis, proliferation and cancer stem cell after the administration of rhIL-38.
However, I don’t know whether IL-36R, the receptor of IL-38, is expressed in tumor cells or not.
Did you analyze the IL-36R expression in NSCLC?
5. In present study, the authors showed that IL-38 was barely expressed in the NSCLC tissues but
highly expressed in the adjacent normal tissues, and that reduced IL-38 in NSCLC was associated
with poor prognosis. However, previous studies revealed the opposite results. Briefly, Tominaga
M et al. showed that IL-38 protein was not strongly expressed in normal pulmonary alveolar
tissues (Respir Investig 2017; 55: 293-299) and Takada K et al. showed that high IL-38 expression
was associated with poor survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients (PLoS One 2017; 12:
e0181598). The authors should cite these literatures and edit the discussion regarding the opposite
results.

Board Member's Comments to Author(s):
The manuscript needs major revisions in order to be considered for publication at the Open
Biology. Some of the major concerns include lack of histological staining used for quantification
of IL-38 expression in human tumour tissues; lack of assessment of IL36R expression on human
cancer cell lines used in the study, as well as lack of rationale for using these specific cell lines.

Finally, the authors completely disregard previously published literature on the role of IL-38 in
lung cancer. These and additional concerns pointed out by the reviewers need to be addressed.

Responses to Board Member's
1. The manuscript needs major revisions in order to be considered
for publication at the Open Biology. Some of the major concerns
include lack of histological staining used for quantification of IL-38
expression in human tumour tissues; lack of assessment of IL36R
expression on human cancer cell lines used in the study, as well as
lack of rationale for using these specific cell lines. Finally, the
authors completely disregard previously published literature on the
role of IL-38 in lung cancer. These and additional concerns pointed
out by the reviewers need to be addressed.
Response: Thanks. We carefully addressed all your comments as
outlined below.
Responses to Referee 1.
1. Full name for "CI" in table 2-3
Response: Thanks. We have updated the information in Tables and
highlighted as yellow.
2. Use box and whiskers plots for data presentation in Figure 1A and
Figure 4A, 4B.
Response: Thanks. We have updated the Figure 1 and Figure 4.
3. Repeat some important findings on at least one newly isolated
cancer cell line.
Response: Thanks. We have updated the information in
Supplementary Figure 1 and 2. Page 13, line 316-317; page 14,
line333-334 and highlighted as yellow.
4. The physiological and pathological concentration of IL-38 (Figure
1B) is much less than the concentration the authors used for in vitro
studies (Figure 2 and 3). Does this mean that the authors
misinterpreted the data as too high IL-38 concentration used.
Response: Thanks. It is true that both the physiological and
pathological concentration of IL-38 are much lower than the
concentration we used for in vitro studies. It is reasonable as the
physiological and pathological levels of IL-38 could not suppress the
cancer development otherwise there would be no cancer at all. The
higher concentration of IL-38 is effective and it is achievable via gene
therapy or protein infusion as we demonstrated in the mice model.
5. Show some representative figures for Figure 4A and 4B.
Response: Thanks. We have updated the figures.
Responses to Referee 2.
1. The authors examined the association between IL-38 expression
and patient characteristics. In this study, a total of 384 patients with
surgically resected NSCLC were enrolled, but Table 1 showed that
this study included the patients with stage IV disease. Why did this
study include the patients with stage IV disease? Moreover, there is
a lack of information about the histology (adenocarcinoma or
squamous cell carcinoma), smoking history, and the presence of
pleural and lymphatic invasion. Please provide more detail on the
patient characteristics and re-examine the association between IL-38
expression and patient characteristics.
Response: Thanks. We included the stage IV samples because the
IL-38 levels are more related with the disease progression in stage IV
patients. Please check the tables. And we also updated the
information according to the suggestions, Table1 and highlighted as
yellow.
2. The authors evaluated IL-38 expression in NSCLC by
immunohistochemistry, but give little information about the
expression pattern of IL-38, for example, membrane of tumor cells
or cytoplasm of tumor cells and the presence of heterogeneity.
Please show the representative images of no expression, weak
expression, and strong expression of IL-38.
Response: Thanks. We have updated the representative figures in
Figure 1D. Page 19, line 478-479.
3. In vitro study, the authors used two human NSCLC cell lines A549
and SK-MES-1. Why did you use these two cell lines? Why didn’t
you use the other NSCLC cell lines?
Response: Because these two NSCLC cell lines are widely used by
other researchers. To further confirm our findings, we also repeated
the important findings in freshly isolated NSCLC cells. Supplementary
Figure 1 and 2. Page 13, line 316-317; page 14, line333-334 and
highlighted as yellow.
4. In vitro study, the authors investigated the role of IL-38 in NSCLC
development, cell migration, invasion, apoptosis, proliferation and
cancer stem cell after the administration of rhIL-38. However, it is
unknown whether IL-36R, the receptor of IL-38, is expressed in
tumor cells or not. Did you analyze the IL-36R expression in NSCLC?
Response: Thanks. We have added the western blot result for IL-36R
in Figure 2A. Page 13, line 310-311 and highlighted as yellow.
5. In present study, the authors showed that IL-38 was barely
expressed in the NSCLC tissues but highly expressed in the adjacent
normal tissues, and that reduced IL-38 in NSCLC was associated with
poor prognosis. However, previous studies revealed the opposite
results. Briefly, Tominaga M et al. showed that IL-38 protein was not
strongly expressed in normal pulmonary alveolar tissues (Respir

IL-38 expression was associated with poor survival of lung
adenocarcinoma patients (PLoS One 2017; 12: e0181598). The
authors should cite these literatures and edit the discussion
regarding the opposite results.
Response: Thank you very much. We have updated the references
and the discussion about the opposite result. Page 16, line 383-393
and highlighted as yellow.
