This study describes the generation of IFT140 null mutants in the protist parasite Leishmania
mexicana, and the subsequent detailed analysis of the phenotypic consequences for flagellum
assembly and cell morphogenesis. The experimental work is excellent, and I have only minor
comments to make on the results. However, I am not convinced the findings reported in this
study are of sufficient general interest to justify publication in Open Biology, rather than a
specialist parasitology journal. Nevertheless, below I make some suggestions that would improve
the manuscript, particularly for a non-specialist audience.
Although it is clearly appropriate to explain IFT (and the role of IFT140) in some detail, for the
non-specialist audience (or indeed those lacking detailed knowledge of trypansomatid biology)
the introduction does not provide sufficient background to Leishmania cell morphology, or cell-
and life cycle-related morphogenetic events. Many of the results presented in this study require
detailed understanding of the flagellar pocket, as well as cytoskeletal elements (such as the
microtubule quartet) and flagellum attachment zone. Therefore, without a better introduction to
Leishmania cellular architecture, it will be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the subject area to
understand or appreciate the results that pertain to these structures.
Although the phase contrast images provided in the manuscript support the authors’ contention
that the ‘thin tubular structures’ observed in the <U+0394>ift140 cells are ‘distinct from a flagellum’, were
the <U+0394>ift140 cells also labelled with an antibody against either an axonemal or PFR protein to
conclusively demonstrate lack of cytoskeletal components within these ‘plasmanemes’?
In Figure 5, the authors suggest that the electron dense material underlying the cell membrane in
the neck region, likely represents cytoplasmic attachment plaques, which in wild type cells attach
the cell body and flagellum. However, the authors comment that the electron dense material is
'less distinctive and ordered than typical Leishmania FAZ junctional complexes' and show that
the flagellum is not attached. So the comment that <U+0394>ift140 cells 'did not lack cytoplasmic
attachment plaques' needs to be amended, since the electron dense material does not mediate
flagellum attachment.
The accumulation of membranous structures within the flagellar pocket of <U+0394>ift140 cells is a
striking observation. The authors suggest this may reflect loss of vesicular material from the
flagellum resulting from the formation of short rudimentary flagellum in <U+0394>ift140 mutants. The
authors suggest that loss of vesicular material from the flagellum could also occur during
promastigote to amastigote differentiation, as this would allow for the disposal of excess flagellar
3
membrane. Is there any experimental evidence to support this, either from this laboratory’s
previous studies on promastigote-amastigote differentiation, or from studies by other groups?
Given that during its life cycle Leishmania forms an amastigote stage that possesses a
rudimentary flagellum, I am curious to know why the authors state ‘remarkably the loss of
flagellum elongation is well tolerated by the Leishmania cell’. Why do they consider the
toleration of a rudimentary flagellum in their IFT mutant cells to be remarkable?

Dependency relationships between IFT-dependent flagellum elongation and cell morphogenesis
in Leishmania.
Dr Jack Sunter and colleagues.
Summary
Intraflagellar transport is an important mechanism for the generation and function of axonemal-
4
based organelles. Moreover, IFT machinery is conserved in eukaryotes and is essential for motile
and non-motile cilia. It is therefore an important area of study to understand axonemal function
in metazoans, plants, protists and in the case of this manuscript protist pathogens. The work
submitted in this manuscript investigates the role of IFT140 in Leishmania mexicana by
producing IFT140 KO cell lines (some tagged) that produce very short flagella and form
amastigote-like phenotypes. The authors analyze the role IFT140 plays in flagellar function and
correlate this with cell morphogenesis. Numerous additional phenotypic traits are observed in
these KO cells including the accumulation of vesicles within the flagellar pocket, the formation of
plasmonemenes and misplaced FAZ proteins. The work is very strong in the sense that it defines
and explains the dependencies between IFT, flagella function and cell morphology and relate
these with observations made in true amastigote forms. These definitions and results are novel
and important in understanding the biology of this pathogen. The work is of very high standard,
is clear and concise, has novel insights into flagella function and cell morphology and should be
published in Open Biology. Weaknesses are that there are some points that need to be clarified
and others that need to be substantiated. Subsequently, I have some comments and points
outlined below, that I think the authors should address before this work should be published.
Main comments
Line 207 and Figure 2C. Please explain why IFT52::eYFP marker is associated with plasmonemes
since no axoneme is associated with these structures?
Line 568. The authors suggest that there is no accummilation of IFT-B material in the flagellum of
the IFT140 KO cell line because of shedding of these proteins. However, they offer no hard proof
of this. I would suggest that they either remove this statement or show a western blot or other
evidence of IFT-B proteins present in the culture medium.
Figures 1-7. The flagellar of IFT140 KO cells is short and terminates near the FPC. It would be
informative if the authors could probe such cells to investigate whether the FPC is normal.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_3
The authors present a manuscript on the consequences of the loss of intraflagellar transport in
Leishmania. The authors provide a good introduction on the topic at hand and have prepared
overall a well written manuscript. They present their mostly descriptive data in seven figures
including some quantifications.
The major finding is that loss of IFT leads to a short flagellum (which has been reported before)
and that flagellum has an amastigote like 9+0 configuration. Furthermore, lack of IFT does not
impact normal promastigote cell morphogenesis.
I have a little problem with how the authors connect the differentiation between pro and
amastigotes with the IFT. I think it needs to be really clear that they have no evidence if and how
IFT is involved in differentiation. What they show is that lack of IFT leads to a short flagellum in
promastigotes. Whatever happens in amastigotes or during the differentiation is not shown. In
that light they should carefully rephrase the part in the abstract.
There is very little I have to correct in the article, however I would also like to mention that
despite the beautiful tomograms and IFA imagery there is only incremental knowledge increase
and that knowledge gain is really limited to this group of parasites, thus I am not sure if the
publication would not be better suited for a more specialized parasitology journal.
Minor comments.
P3, L57: Referencing the latest review on the TAC would be appropriate here.
P5, L94: The sentence starting with: In T. brucei, the basal body is a central organiser of cell
morphogenesis.... reads rather awkward. I suggest to separate out the different statements into
individual sentences.
P8, L180: Is there any evidence presented for the detection of the plasmanemes as distinct
structures??? I might have missed that. If not please provide or remove sentence.

Appendix A
We thank the referees for their comments and have introduced changes to
the text and performed extra measurements and experiments to address
them, which we believe have improved the manuscript. Our responses to the
specific referees’ comments are below in blue text.
Referee: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This study describes the generation of IFT140 null mutants in the protist
parasite Leishmania mexicana, and the subsequent detailed analysis of the
phenotypic consequences for flagellum assembly and cell morphogenesis.
The experimental work is excellent, and I have only minor comments to make
on the results. However, I am not convinced the findings reported in this
study are of sufficient general interest to justify publication in Open Biology,
rather than a specialist parasitology journal. Nevertheless, below I make
some suggestions that would improve the manuscript, particularly for a non-
specialist audience.
Although it is clearly appropriate to explain IFT (and the role of IFT140) in
some detail, for the non-specialist audience (or indeed those lacking detailed
knowledge of trypansomatid biology) the introduction does not provide
sufficient background to Leishmania cell morphology, or cell- and life cycle-
related morphogenetic events. Many of the results presented in this study
require detailed understanding of the flagellar pocket, as well as cytoskeletal
elements (such as the microtubule quartet) and flagellum attachment zone.
Therefore, without a better introduction to Leishmania cellular architecture, it
will be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the subject area to understand or
appreciate the results that pertain to these structures.
We believe – from presentations at general cell biology meetings – there is
generic interest in this report, particularly in the cilium / flagellum / cell
morphogenesis community. In that context it appears that we have focussed
too much in the introduction on these aspects and not enough on the
background of the organism. We agree with the referee that more
background into the cellular architecture around the flagellar pocket would
help the non-specialist reader and have therefore added extra detail into the
introduction. (lines 71-81)
Although the phase contrast images provided in the manuscript support the
authors’ contention that the ‘thin tubular structures’ observed in the <U+0394>ift140
cells are ‘distinct from a flagellum’, were the <U+0394>ift140 cells also labelled with an
antibody against either an axonemal or PFR protein to conclusively
demonstrate lack of cytoskeletal components within these ‘plasmanemes’?
The evidence that there is no axoneme or paraflagellar rod structures in the
plasmanemes is confirmed by direct electron microscopic analysis. We have
added this statement to the text to clarify. Moreover, we draw attention to this
specifically in relation to Fig S2A emphasising that the plasmanemes
originate from the flagellum but do not contain an axoneme or a paraflagellar
rod. We have confirmed this with an anti-PFR antibody (Fig. S2B). Lines 172-
175
However, because of this origin of the plasmanemes it is highly likely that
they will contain flagellum membrane and other flagellar proteins. In that
context we show (discussed below) that they do contain other IFT proteins
(IFT52) and the flagellar membrane specific protein SMP1.
In Figure 5, the authors suggest that the electron dense material underlying
the cell membrane in the neck region, likely represents cytoplasmic
attachment plaques, which in wild type cells attach the cell body and
flagellum. However, the authors comment that the electron dense material is
'less distinctive and ordered than typical Leishmania FAZ junctional
complexes' and show that the flagellum is not attached. So the comment that
<U+0394>ift140 cells 'did not lack cytoplasmic attachment plaques' needs to be
amended, since the electron dense material does not mediate flagellum
attachment.
We have amended this sentence to reflect that these junctional complexes
are not mediating flagellum attachment. Although the plaques observed in the
FAZ area of <U+0394>ift140 cells are not mediating attachment of the flagellum to the
cell body, they are nevertheless morphologically akin to FAZ attachment
plaques found in parental cells, yet are unordered and clustered, and often
mediating a membrane vesicle to cell body connection (Fig. 6F). This
complexity is important to rehearse since it suggest that IFT is important for
delivery / organisation / linkage coordination, but likely not for parts of the
attachment plaque assembly per se. Lines 324-335.
The accumulation of membranous structures within the flagellar pocket of
<U+0394>ift140 cells is a striking observation. The authors suggest this may reflect
loss of vesicular material from the flagellum resulting from the formation of
short rudimentary flagellum in <U+0394>ift140 mutants. The authors suggest that loss
of vesicular material from the flagellum could also occur during promastigote
to amastigote differentiation, as this would allow for the disposal of excess
flagellar membrane. Is there any experimental evidence to support this, either
from this laboratory’s previous studies on promastigote-amastigote
differentiation, or from studies by other groups?
Previous work from our lab by Wheeler and colleagues examined the
disassembly of the Leishmania flagellum as promastigotes differentiated to
amastigotes inside host cells. For one of these experiments they infected
macrophages with Leishmania promastigotes expressing SMP1 tagged with
eGFP and the differentiation was followed using time lapse microscopy
(supplementary movie 1). This published video clearly shows that the
shrinking flagellum of differentiating cells sheds streams and vesicles of
SMP1 labelled material, supporting our hypothesis that shedding of flagellar
membrane is important for the disassembly of the flagellum during
promastigote to amastigote differentiation. We have added a section into the
discussion where we examine this data. Lines 561-573
Given that during its life cycle Leishmania forms an amastigote stage that
possesses a rudimentary flagellum, I am curious to know why the authors
state ‘remarkably the loss of flagellum elongation is well tolerated by the
Leishmania cell’. Why do they consider the toleration of a rudimentary
flagellum in their IFT mutant cells to be remarkable?
We have removed this comment, the issue was about whether a mutant in a
cell that normally has a flagellum can survive without one, rather than another
type of cell differentiated to exhibit this phenomenon naturally.

Dependency relationships between IFT-dependent flagellum elongation and
cell morphogenesis in Leishmania.
Dr Jack Sunter and colleagues.
Summary
Intraflagellar transport is an important mechanism for the generation and
function of axonemal-based organelles. Moreover, IFT machinery is
conserved in eukaryotes and is essential for motile and non-motile cilia. It is
therefore an important area of study to understand axonemal function in
metazoans, plants, protists and in the case of this manuscript protist
pathogens. The work submitted in this manuscript investigates the role of
IFT140 in Leishmania mexicana by producing IFT140 KO cell lines (some
tagged) that produce very short flagella and form amastigote-like phenotypes.
The authors analyze the role IFT140 plays in flagellar function and correlate
this with cell morphogenesis. Numerous additional phenotypic traits are
observed in these KO cells including the accumulation of vesicles within the
flagellar pocket, the formation of plasmonemenes and misplaced FAZ
proteins. The work is very strong in the sense that it defines and explains the
dependencies between IFT, flagella function and cell morphology and relate
these with observations made in true amastigote forms. These definitions and
results are novel and important in understanding the biology of this pathogen.
The work is of very high standard, is clear and concise, has novel insights
into flagella function and cell morphology and should be published in Open
Biology. Weaknesses are that there are some points that need to be clarified
and others that need to be substantiated. Subsequently, I have some
comments and points outlined below, that I think the authors should address
before this work should be published.
Main comments
Line 207 and Figure 2C. Please explain why IFT52::eYFP marker is
associated with plasmonemes since no axoneme is associated with these
structures?
We have rehearsed aspects of this explanation above. However, to expand: a
rudimentary flagellum with a transition zone and shorter/collapsed axoneme
is assembled in the <U+0394>IFT140 cells, presumably due the activity of the
anterograde IFT system, of which IFT52 is a component. As IFT140 is
involved in the recycling of anterograde IFT material from the flagellum tip to
its base in other systems, we expected that anterograde IFT components
such as IFT52 would be transported to the flagellum upon knockout of IFT140
and as above will become incorporated in the plasmanemes that emerge
from the flagellum tip (Fig. S2A, 6G). We have added an explanation of this
hypothesis to the discussion. (Lines 591-596)
Line 568. The authors suggest that there is no accummilation of IFT-B
material in the flagellum of the IFT140 KO cell line because of shedding of
these proteins. However, they offer no hard proof of this. I would suggest that
they either remove this statement or show a western blot or other evidence of
IFT-B proteins present in the culture medium.
In retrograde IFT knockouts in other organisms IFT52 anterograde
components tend to accumulate at the flagellum tip. This doesn’t happen in
the Leishmania IFT140 KO and we have altered the discussion to make it
clear that the shedding of these proteins is a plausible hypothesis to explain
the difference. The hypothesis is based on the fact that, in Leishmania, the
flagellum of IFT140 KO cells seems to discard excessive membranous
material via plasmanemes (which harbour the flagellar membrane marker
SMP1). (Lines 591-596)
Figures 1-7. The flagellar of IFT140 KO cells is short and terminates near the
FPC. It would be informative if the authors could probe such cells to
investigate whether the FPC is normal.
We suspect that the referee missed this aspect in the manuscript and so
have clarified it. We have analysed the FPC extensively using thin section
electron microscopy and electron tomography. In our TEM analysis we could
not identify clear differences between the FPC in the parental and IFT140 KO
cells: the two electron dense filaments were present in both and appeared to
be following the expected C-shaped path around the collar constriction,
leaving a “gap” for the MTQ (Fig. 4B-D, 6A, Supp. Movie 2). Moreover, there
was no difference in FPC width between IFT140 KO and parental cells, when
we measured this distance on our TEM images – we have added this data to
the manuscript (lines 291 - 297). In addition, our electron tomography
enabled us to examine the 3D structure of the FPC and again we observed
no differences between the parental an IFT140 KO cells.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present a manuscript on the consequences of the loss of
intraflagellar transport in Leishmania. The authors provide a good introduction
on the topic at hand and have prepared overall a well written manuscript.
They present their mostly descriptive data in seven figures including some
quantifications.
The major finding is that loss of IFT leads to a short flagellum (which has
been reported before) and that flagellum has an amastigote like 9+0
configuration. Furthermore, lack of IFT does not impact normal promastigote
cell morphogenesis.
I have a little problem with how the authors connect the differentiation
between pro and amastigotes with the IFT. I think it needs to be really clear
that they have no evidence if and how IFT is involved in differentiation. What
they show is that lack of IFT leads to a short flagellum in promastigotes.
Whatever happens in amastigotes or during the differentiation is not shown.
In that light they should carefully rephrase the part in the abstract.
We have revisited the abstract and revised the wording to ensure that the
possible roles of the IFT system in promastigote to amastigote differentiation
are clearly phrased as conjecture.
There is very little I have to correct in the article, however I would also like to
mention that despite the beautiful tomograms and IFA imagery there is only
incremental knowledge increase and that knowledge gain is really limited to
this group of parasites, thus I am not sure if the publication would not be
better suited for a more specialized parasitology journal.
Minor comments.
P3, L57: Referencing the latest review on the TAC would be appropriate
here.
We have added this citation.
P5, L94: The sentence starting with: In T. brucei, the basal body is a central
organiser of cell morphogenesis.... reads rather awkward. I suggest to
separate out the different statements into individual sentences.
We have rephrased this sentence.
P8, L180: Is there any evidence presented for the detection of the
plasmanemes as distinct structures??? I might have missed that. If not
please provide or remove sentence.
We have now included an example of this in Supplementary Figure 2C.

We have corrected this mistake – thanks.
