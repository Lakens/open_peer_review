This is a potentially interesting piece of work that addresses the identity of cells that line the
central canal of the zebrafish spinal cord and potentially contribute to spinal cord regeneration.
However there a number of issues that need clarification:
1. Are the cells discussed here really ependymal cells? As the authors point out most of the cells
that line the central canal have a radial glial morphology with their basal processes extending all
the way out to the pial surface of the cord. This isn’t a characteristic of ependymal cells in
mammals, which have only short radial processes that do not reach the pial surface. Also most of
the zebrafish cells that contact the central canal are GFAP positive and I’m not sure that is true of
mammalian ependyma (some GFAP positive processes may reach the central canal surface but I
think these come from more basally positioned astrocytes). So I think its important to make it
clear these zebrafish cells are not fully equivalent to mammalian ependymal cells. Other authors
have called the fish cells “ependymal radial glia”, and some would simply call them radial glia. I
think this is an important point that needs to be made clear to readers in the introduction and
needs some discussion.
2. The relationship of the GFP reporter of foxj1a to the endogenous foxj1a RNA expression seems
rather unclear. The fluorescent in situ signals are quite hard to interpret as the signal is very
punctate and quite hard to assign to individual cells in the figures and often doesn’t seem to
match the GFP reporter expression. The best example of this is comparing Figure 2H to Figures
2C and D, also comparing Figures 6 F and G. They seem really quite different.
3. The GFP reporter also seems to be problematic because the levels of GFP are quite different in
different cells around the central canal. This makes deciding whether the reporter is expressed or
not rather difficult. There seem to me to be examples where the authors decide foxj1a:GFP is not
expressed but I would say that it is expressed weakly (for example some panels in Figure 5). This
point becomes especially important as the authors suggest their results demonstrate foxj1a:GFP
expression may be controlled different elements in development, maintenance and regeneration.
4. The authors talk about “lumen closure” as the large lumen of the early spinal cord is
remodelled to become the much smaller central canal of the more mature larva and adult. The
lumen is always closed during this process, it just becomes much smaller. So the authors should
remove the phrase lumen closure.
5. I think some discussion of the use of PCNA as a read out of proliferating cells is required. I
believe there is some produrance of PCNA in post-mitotic cells, so it doesn’t always tell you
which cells are in the cell cycle.
6. Some speculation about why knockdown of foxj1a alters position of the central canal should be
attempted in the discussion. What might be happening at the cellular level?

label_comment_2
This is a well-written and well-illustrated paper that extends to zebrafish knowledge about the
role of Foxj1 (Foxj1a in zebrafish) in the proliferation and differentiation of ependymal cells,
studied previously in mouse. This allows the information to be applied to a species in which the
injured spinal cord can regenerate. Foxj1a is a transcription factor involved in the generation of
cillia, and thus it is critical for the differentiation of ependymal cells, which in zebrafish are the
source of new neurons and glia after spinal cord injury, whereas in adult mammals, ependymal
cells give rise only to glia. Because the same cells can be driven to a neuronal phenotype in vitro,
the spinal cord environment may be limiting the phenotypic flexibilty of ependymal cells in
mammals. The experimental results, using a Foxj1a:GFP reporter transgenic line, suggest several
important conclusions about Foxj1a in zebrafish:
1. In normal development, Foxj1a is expressed in all ependymal cells, including ependymal radial
glia and csf-contacting neurons, from the formation of the neural tube into adulthood.
2. Inhibition of Foxj1a expression with a morpholino causes delay in closure of the lumen of the
central canal (delayed dorsal zipping), and a slight dorsal shift in its position, although it did not
affect the phenotypes of the ependymal cells.
3. Inhibition of Foxj1a expression with a morpholino attenuated sonic hedgehog (Shh) activity
and delayed cessation of ependymal cell proliferation.
4. Foxj1a expressing cells proliferate in response to spinal cord injury, although not all the
resulting cells that remained around the central canal were labeled with GFP. In particular, the
ependymal radial glial cells often lost their Foxj1a label, while the csf-contacting neurons
maintained Foxj1a expression. However, even the GFP-non-labeled proliferating cells
upregulated the Foxj1a transcripts, suggesting that the transgene promotor used to drive GFP
4
lacked some injury-dependent regulatory sequence needed to drive Foxj1a expression after
injury.
5. Finally, inhibition of Sonic hedgehog signaling with Cyclopamine reduced FISH staining for
Foxj1a transcripts, suggesting that Sonic hedgehog stimulates ependymal proliferation by
stimulating Foxj1a transcription.
The authors conclude that spinal cord injury activates Sonic hedgehog, which induces
proliferation of ependymal cells and consequent regeneration of spinal cord neurons and glia.
The conclusions appear to be well supported by the data, but manuscript could be improved by
making a few clarifications, particularly to make the paper easier to follow for those who are not
intimately familiar with the zebrafish literature:
1. The title is cumbersome. It could be changed to: “Foxj1a is expressed in ependymal precursors
in zebrafish embryos, regulates the formation of the central canal and is activated in new
ependymal cells during regeneration.”
2. The authors could be more direct in specifying which principles about Foxj1a expression and
activity are already established in mammals, which of these are different in zebrafish, and which
findings are truly novel.
3. The designation “Foxj1a:GFP” suggests that the transgene expresses GFP, rather than a Foxj1a-
GFP fusion protein, but this should be specified early, since there could be functional
consequences to the difference.
4. Similarly, the morpholino used to knock down Foxj1a is described as “translation-blocking,”
which suggests that it targets the start codon. Although the morpholino has been described
previously, it would be helpful for those not familiar with morpholino techniques to specify this
in the text.
5. The authors should say something about how specific Foxj1a is for ependymal cells. For
example, in Figure 2C, at 52 hours post-fertilization, the transgene appears to be expressed in
neural crest cells.
6. Finally, the authors indicate that an important rationale for studying Foxj1 in zebrafish is the
potential for understanding of how to overcome the gliogenesis bias of ependymal cells in vivo.
Therefore, it would be useful if the authors discussed how their findings in zebrafish could be
used to understand why proliferating ependymal cells at the site of spinal cord injury in
mammals do not become neurons, why this limits functional regeneration, particularly in spinal
cord levels away from the cervical and lumbar motor pools, and how the limitations could be
overcome. This is especially true in light of the failure of their transgene to label many of the
proliferating ependymal cells, i.e., the ependymal radial glia.

The manuscript by Ribeiro et al. describes the expression of Foxj1a in the adult zebrafish spinal
cord and during development. The authors show that during spinal cord development, Foxj1a is
required for the correct positioning of the central canal. They use morpholinos and crispr mutants
in their analysis. Furthermore, they show that Foxj1a cells proliferate during regeneration after
injury and contribute to the restoration of the spinal cord.
The experiments are well conducted and the results sound. However, I would like to make few
considerations.
1) the authors compare the endogenous expression of Foxj1a cells with the one of the reporter in
Figure 1. However the endogenous expression detected by FISH are not very clear .Better images
and separate channels should be provided. This is important since upon regeneration the authors
observe endogenous expression in Foxj1a in many proliferating cells that are not GFP. From this,
they conclude that the activation of Foxj1a during regeneration uses a different regulatory
element. Since in Figure 1C is not clear the reporter ad endogenous expression in non-
regenerative adult spinal cord, it is still possible that the reporter recapitulates well the
expression during development but not in adult and therefore is missing cells in non-regenerative
conditions and regenerative conditions.
2) The authors perform experiments of loss of function using the crispr technique but only very
few animals are affected. Therefore, this experiment is very weak and I am not sure if at the
present moment can be added. Are the embryos analyzed F0?. If crispr mutantsexperiments are
included, they should be descendants of F0. Can they use the crispr adults to check whether
Foxj1a is required for restoration of injury?
3) In Results,the description of how the compression injury protocol should briefly introduced
to the non-specialist. In addition, explain in text how the area of regeneration is the section being
followed.
4) The phenotype in lumen closure in Foxj1a morphants is described and related to increased Shh
activity. Are cilia lost in the morphants? From the morphant phenotype during development, it
seems that Foxj1a promotes differentiation or at least low levels of Foxj1a induce progenitor
proliferation. However, thisseems to be the opposite during regeneration. Please, discuss this.
5) In non-regenerative adult spinal cord, there are ependymal cells proliferating cells? Are those
Foxj1a?
6) the authors make a strong case stating that studying Foxj1a cells in zebrafish can provide better
information why in zebrafish can give rise to neurons and not in mammals, thus it seems that the
reporter line could be a good tool for studying ependymal regeneration. At the end, we find that
this reporter does not respond to injury cues, thus is not good for regenerative experiments.
6
Altogether, there is a bit of a deception for the arguments posed at the introduction and they
could adjust the intro for this.

I think this revised manuscript contains interesting data and adds to the field of study, but I still
have one major reservation about this paper. That is the identity and name the authors give to the
cells expressing foxj1a. I strongly think it is a mistake to call these cells ependymal cells, in fact I
think it is misleading. As the authors say almost all the cells expressing foxj1a:GFP have a radial
glia morphology. Ependymal cells do not have a radial glial morphology, they may have short
radial processes that poke out into the subventricular zone, but they do not have long radial
processes that reach the pial surface. I suspect the authors wish to call them ependymal cells as
this potentially makes their study more interesting to labs studying the stem cell and regenerative
potential of ependyma in mammalian systems. I strongly recommend the authors use the term
ependymo-radial glia (ERG) throughout this manuscript to make it clear these cells may not be
equivalent to ependyma in mammals. This does not dimish the data, it makes it more transparent
and open.

Comments to the Author(s)
I think this revised manuscript contains interesting data and adds to the field of study, but I still
have one major reservation about this paper. That is the identity and name the authors give to the
cells expressing foxj1a. I strongly think it is a mistake to call these cells ependymal cells, in fact I
think it is misleading. As the authors say almost all the cells expressing foxj1a:GFP have a radial
glia morphology. Ependymal cells do not have a radial glial morphology, they may have short
radial processes that poke out into the subventricular zone, but they do not have long radial
processes that reach the pial surface. I suspect the authors wish to call them ependymal cells as
this potentially makes their study more interesting to labs studying the stem cell and regenerative
potential of ependyma in mammalian systems. I strongly recommend the authors use the term
ependymo-radial glia (ERG) throughout this manuscript to make it clear these cells may not be
equivalent to ependyma in mammals. This does not dimish the data, it makes it more transparent
and open.

Appendix A
Referee 1
“This is a potentially interesting piece of work that addresses the identity of cells that
line the central canal of the zebrafish spinal cord and potentially contribute to spinal
cord regeneration. However there a number of issues that need clarification:
1. Are the cells discussed here really ependymal cells? As the authors point out most
of the cells that line the central canal have a radial glial morphology with their basal
processes extending all the way out to the pial surface of the cord. This isn’t a
characteristic of ependymal cells in mammals, which have only short radial processes
that do not reach the pial surface. Also most of the zebrafish cells that contact the
central canal are GFAP positive and I’m not sure that is true of mammalian ependyma
(some GFAP positive processes may reach the central canal surface but I think these
come from more basally positioned astrocytes). So I think its important to make it clear
these zebrafish cells are not fully equivalent to mammalian ependymal cells. Other
authors have called the fish cells “ependymal radial glia”, and some would simply call
them radial glia. I think this is an important point that needs to be made clear to readers
in the introduction and needs some discussion.”
We agree with the reviewer that a clarification was needed regarding the
differences between the ependymal region in zebrafish and mammals. We use the
term ependymal cells to specify all cells that contact the central canal, irrespective of
function or morphology. We follow the nomenclature used in previous mouse work,
which name as ependymal cells all lumen-contacting cells in the mouse spinal cord,
despite having heterogeneous morphologies (cuboidal, tanycyte and radial) (Meletis
et al., 2008). Regarding the long radial projections observed in zebrafish, they are also
present in dorsal and ventral cells in the mouse ependymal region, as detected with
filamentous markers such as Nestin and Vimentin (Hamilton et al., 2009; Meletis et
al., 2008). Nevertheless, we agree that zebrafish has a higher proportion of cells with
radial morphology and we have included this observation in the results (page 6) and
discussion (page 14). Likewise, we have made clearer that there are differences in
protein expression in ependymal cells between zebrafish and mammals, namely in the
distribution of GFAP and Vimentin (page 6 and page 14).
“2. The relationship of the GFP reporter of foxj1a to the endogenous foxj1a RNA
expression seems rather unclear. The fluorescent in situ signals are quite hard to
interpret as the signal is very punctate and quite hard to assign to individual cells in
the figures and often doesn’t seem to match the GFP reporter expression. The best
example of this is comparing Figure 2H to Figures 2C and D, also comparing Figures
6 F and G. They seem really quite different.”
We agree with the reviewer that there were some differences between the
endogenous foxj1a expression detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization and the
corresponding foxj1a:GFP reporter (Figures 2C,D,H). To detect foxj1a transcript
distribution in an independent manner, we compared in adjacent sections the
expression of the reporter with the endogenous gene using a colorimetric in situ
hybridization.
The results of this new analysis performed at 3 different stages (48, 52 and 56 hpf)
are now shown in the new Supplementary Figure 3. This analysis revealed that foxj1a
transcript is not only expressed in the floor plate and roof plate, but also in cells close
to the lumen in the middle region of the neural tube. By contrast, the foxj1a:GFP
reporter failed to label this middle domain, labelling only the ventral and dorsal
domains. This distribution is very similar to one we have previously reported in our
manuscript (Figure 2 H). Therefore, we are very confident that foxj1a is expressed in
the cells that will give rise to the central canal.
We have now described in more detail the domains of foxj1a expression and mention
the differences observed in the Results (page7) and Discussion (page 14) sections.
We have also made clear in the manuscript that the enhancer sequence size/region
in this reporter is not sufficient to fully reproduce the endogenous expression.
In Figures 6F and G we show larvae with 8 dpf, and again we also see that there are
differences between the distribution of the transcript and the transgene. In a normal
spinal cord at this stage the level of foxj1a expression is low and we could not increase
the exposure time because we needed to maintain the same image acquisition
settings to be able to compare the transcript levels between un-injured and injured
spinal cords (compare Figure 6G with 6I). Again, we are very confident that foxj1a is
expressed in the cells of the ependymal canal and that this transgene is not faithfully
reporting the endogenous expression of foxj1a.
“3. The GFP reporter also seems to be problematic because the levels of GFP are
quite different in different cells around the central canal. This makes deciding whether
the reporter is expressed or not rather difficult. There seem to me to be examples
where the authors decide foxj1a:GFP is not expressed but I would say that it is
expressed weakly (for example some panels in Figure 5). This point becomes
especially important as the authors suggest their results demonstrate foxj1a:GFP
expression may be controlled different elements in development, maintenance and
regeneration.”
We agree with the reviewer that the transgene levels are heterogeneous in the
ependymal region. To deal with this heterogeneity, in Figure 5 we quantified the
number of cells expressing GFP and/or PCNA, instead of presenting just a qualitative
description. For this quantification, we defined a cell as GFP-positive if the GFP levels
were above background levels, measured in a Foxj1a-negative region (white matter).
Using this quantification method, we observed that the majority of proliferating or
newly-formed cells expressed GFP levels below background levels. To be more
accurate, we have changed the text to say that these cells had low or negative GFP
levels (page 11). However, whether the GFP levels are low or absent, these results
indicate that the foxj1a:GFP transgene is not as strongly expressed in the lateral
regions (where most PCNA+ cells accumulate) as in the dorsal and ventral regions.
This pattern contrasts with the distribution of the foxj1a transcripts (higher in the lateral
proliferating regions, Figure 6C,D), which is why we suggest that the transgene is not
as responsive to regenerating cues as the endogenous gene.
“4. The authors talk about “lumen closure” as the large lumen of the early spinal cord
is remodelled to become the much smaller central canal of the more mature larva and
adult. The lumen is always closed during this process, it just becomes much smaller.
So the authors should remove the phrase lumen closure.”
We agree with the reviewer that the term lumen closure can be misleading. We
have corrected this expression in the text, changing it to lumen contraction or
narrowing.
“5. I think some discussion of the use of PCNA as a read out of proliferating cells is
required. I believe there is some produrance of PCNA in post-mitotic cells, so it doesn’t
always tell you which cells are in the cell cycle.”
We used PCNA as a proliferation marker because it is widely used in many
fields and organisms. However, it is true that PCNA can be less specific than other
proliferation markers, such as Ki67 and MCM-2. Nevertheless, we believe that, for the
purpose of this work, PCNA can still be useful as a proliferation marker. Even though
the PCNA antibody may label not only cycling cells but also cells that have left the cell
cycle after dividing, this marker still serves as an indicator of the proliferative response,
since it identifies cells that are dividing or have recently divided. Moreover, since very
few PCNA+ cells are observed in the control spinal cord (Figure 5A,A’), the increase
in PCNA+ cells observed after an injury likely reflects an increase in proliferation in
response to injury, as previously reported (Reimer et al., 2008).
“6. Some speculation about why knockdown of foxj1a alters position of the central
canal should be attempted in the discussion. What might be happening at the cellular
level?”
We thank the reviewer for making this suggestion. We have now included in
the discussion a section that attempts to explain how the position of the central canal
is shifted dorsally in the morphants (page 15). We propose that the Foxj1a knockdown,
by promoting the expansion of Shh signalling, may affect the timing of differentiation
of cells along the dorso-ventral axis. Shh expansion may delay the differentiation of
some cells through the maintenance of its mitogenic activity, or it may affect the rate
of differentiation by changing the dorso-ventral identity of progenitor cells. If cells exit
the lumen at the wrong time, the zipping of the lumen can occur incorrectly and the
central canal will be placed in the wrong position.
Referee 2
“This is a well-written and well-illustrated paper that extends to zebrafish knowledge
about the role of Foxj1 (Foxj1a in zebrafish) in the proliferation and differentiation of
ependymal cells, studied previously in mouse. This allows the information to be
applied to a species in which the injured spinal cord can regenerate. Foxj1a is a
transcription factor involved in the generation of cillia, and thus it is critical for the
differentiation of ependymal cells, which in zebrafish are the source of new neurons
and glia after spinal cord injury, whereas in adult mammals, ependymal cells give rise
only to glia. Because the same cells can be driven to a neuronal phenotype in vitro,
the spinal cord environment may be limiting the phenotypic flexibilty of ependymal
cells in mammals. The experimental results, using a Foxj1a:GFP reporter transgenic
line, suggest several important conclusions about Foxj1a in zebrafish:
1. In normal development, Foxj1a is expressed in all ependymal cells, including
ependymal radial glia and csf-contacting neurons, from the formation of the neural
tube into adulthood.
2. Inhibition of Foxj1a expression with a morpholino causes delay in closure of the
lumen of the central canal (delayed dorsal zipping), and a slight dorsal shift in its
position, although it did not affect the phenotypes of the ependymal cells.
3. Inhibition of Foxj1a expression with a morpholino attenuated sonic hedgehog
(Shh) activity and delayed cessation of ependymal cell proliferation.
4. Foxj1a expressing cells proliferate in response to spinal cord injury, although
not all the resulting cells that remained around the central canal were labeled with
GFP. In particular, the ependymal radial glial cells often lost their Foxj1a label, while
the csf-contacting neurons maintained Foxj1a expression. However, even the GFP-
non-labeled proliferating cells upregulated the Foxj1a transcripts, suggesting that the
transgene promotor used to drive GFP lacked some injury-dependent regulatory
sequence needed to drive Foxj1a expression after injury.
5. Finally, inhibition of Sonic hedgehog signaling with Cyclopamine reduced FISH
staining for Foxj1a transcripts, suggesting that Sonic hedgehog stimulates ependymal
proliferation by stimulating Foxj1a transcription.
The authors conclude that spinal cord injury activates Sonic hedgehog, which induces
proliferation of ependymal cells and consequent regeneration of spinal cord neurons
and glia. The conclusions appear to be well supported by the data, but manuscript
could be improved by making a few clarifications, particularly to make the paper easier
to follow for those who are not intimately familiar with the zebrafish literature:”
“1. The title is cumbersome. It could be changed to: “Foxj1a is expressed in ependymal
precursors in zebrafish embryos, regulates the formation of the central canal and is
activated in new ependymal cells during regeneration.”
We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and we have changed the title
accordingly.
“2. The authors could be more direct in specifying which principles about Foxj1a
expression and activity are already established in mammals, which of these are
different in zebrafish, and which findings are truly novel.”
We have added a few sections in the discussion that more clearly explain what
had been described in mammals and what is new in our findings. Specifically, we have
highlighted the differences between the ependymal regions in mouse and zebrafish
(see also comment 1 of reviewer 1). We also explain that Foxj1 expression had been
separately described in the floor plate and in the adult ependymal region in mouse and
in the roof plate in chick. We show for the first time that there is a continuity in this
expression, from the embryonic domains until the adult spinal cord. In addition, we
clarify that Foxj1 had been previously proposed to play a role in the attenuation of Shh
signalling activity during the chick neural tube development, but our work is the first to
describe how this affects the final position of the central canal (pages 14 and 15).
“3. The designation “Foxj1a:GFP” suggests that the transgene expresses GFP, rather
than a Foxj1a-GFP fusion protein, but this should be specified early, since there could
be functional consequences to the difference.”
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have made clearer in the text
that the transgene is composed of a regulatory region of the foxj1a gene upstream of
the GFP sequence (page 5). Please note that this is the accepted nomenclature for
zebrafish transgenics.
“4. Similarly, the morpholino used to knock down Foxj1a is described as “translation-
blocking,” which suggests that it targets the start codon. Although the morpholino has
been described previously, it would be helpful for those not familiar with morpholino
techniques to specify this in the text.”
We have clarified in the text that the used morpholino targets the start codon
(page 8).
“5. The authors should say something about how specific Foxj1a is for ependymal
cells. For example, in Figure 2C, at 52 hours post-fertilization, the transgene appears
to be expressed in neural crest cells.”
Foxj1a endogenous transcripts detected by in situ hybridization within the
spinal cord appears to be restricted to ependymal precursors or ependymal cells. In
embryos Foxj1a is expressed in other ciliated tissues such as the pro-nephric ducts
(asterisks in Figure 2H). However, we believe that the foxj1a:GFP reporter expression
in cells dorsally to the neural tube (putative neural crest cells) is not specific, since this
expression was never detected by in situ hybridisation (Supplementary Figure 3).
“6. Finally, the authors indicate that an important rationale for studying Foxj1 in
zebrafish is the potential for understanding of how to overcome the gliogenesis bias
of ependymal cells in vivo. Therefore, it would be useful if the authors discussed how
their findings in zebrafish could be used to understand why proliferating ependymal
cells at the site of spinal cord injury in mammals do not become neurons, why this
limits functional regeneration, particularly in spinal cord levels away from the cervical
and lumbar motor pools, and how the limitations could be overcome. This is especially
true in light of the failure of their transgene to label many of the proliferating ependymal
cells, i.e., the ependymal radial glia.”
We believe that Foxj1a is a useful marker to follow the fate of ependymal cells
after an injury, even though the transgenic line used in this study is not a reliable
reporter for Foxj1a expression. However, with the right promoter, a Foxj1a reporter
can be used in lineage tracing experiments to determine if ependymal cells give rise
to new neurons and oligodendrocytes in zebrafish. Moreover, a Foxj1a promoter can
also be used to create an ependymal cell ablation transgenic line to assess if
ependymal cells are needed to efficiently repair the spinal cord. We have included
these suggestions in the Discussion (page 17).
The reason behind the limited neurogenic potential of ependymal cells in mammals in
vivo is still unclear. It has been proposed that high levels of Notch activity in the
ependymal region in mouse, but not in zebrafish, inhibit neuronal differentiation
(Yamamoto et al, 2001; Dias et al, 2012). However, to determine if the formation of
new neurons is required for functional recovery, it will be necessary to ablate the
neuronal progenitors (ependymal cells) after an injury as described above.
We are currently trying to identify the complete Foxj1a promoter sequence to use in
future lineage-tracing and cell ablation experiments.
Referee 3
“The manuscript by Ribeiro et al. describes the expression of Foxj1a in the adult
zebrafish spinal cord and during development. The authors show that during spinal
cord development, Foxj1a is required for the correct positioning of the central canal.
They use morpholinos and crispr mutants in their analysis. Furthermore, they show
that Foxj1a cells proliferate during regeneration after injury and contribute to the
restoration of the spinal cord.
The experiments are well conducted and the results sound. However, I would like to
make few considerations.”
“1) the authors compare the endogenous expression of Foxj1a cells with the one of
the reporter in Figure 1. However the endogenous expression detected by FISH are
not very clear .Better images and separate channels should be provided. This is
important since upon regeneration the authors observe endogenous expression in
Foxj1a in many proliferating cells that are not GFP. From this, they conclude that the
activation of Foxj1a during regeneration uses a different regulatory element. Since in
Figure 1C is not clear the reporter ad endogenous expression in non-regenerative
adult spinal cord, it is still possible that the reporter recapitulates well the expression
during development but not in adult and therefore is missing cells in non-regenerative
conditions and regenerative conditions.”
We understand the reviewer’s point about the distribution of the reporter
transgene in comparison to the foxj1a transcripts. Regarding foxj1a expression in the
adult spinal cord, we have included a new image with separate channels in Figure
1(C-C’’’), which we believe shows that foxj1a transcripts are present all around the
central canal. Likewise, the foxj1a:GFP reporter is also expressed in cells around the
central canal, although the expression levels are heterogeneous. These results
indicate that the endogenous gene and the reporter have similar patterns of
expression in the non-regenerating adult spinal cord, although this is not true in the
regenerating spinal cord.
However, we have re-evaluated the similarity between the endogenous gene and the
reporter in the embryonic neural tube and concluded that a middle domain of
expression is not reproduced by the reporter (see also comment 2 of reviewer 1). This
indicates that the foxj1a:GFP reporter lacks some of the regulatory sequences
necessary during development and regeneration. These results and conclusions have
now been added in the Results and Discussion sections (page 7 and page 14).
“2) The authors perform experiments of loss of function using the crispr technique but
only very few animals are affected. Therefore, this experiment is very weak and I am
not sure if at the present moment can be added. Are the embryos analyzed F0?. If
crispr mutants experiments are included, they should be descendants of F0. Can they
use the crispr adults to check whether Foxj1a is required for restoration of injury?”
We agree with the reviewer that the number of crispant embryos is very low.
These embryos are F0, that is, they are the embryos injected with the guide RNAS
and Cas9 protein. Because of the mosaicism of the injection not all cells of the
embryos acquire mutations in the foxj1a gene. Only in very few embryos there were
enough cells with mutations to give rise to a whole body phenotype (the curved body).
We included this experiment despite the low number of embryos to reinforce the
morpholino rescue experiment, which was only partial. However, we understand the
point of the reviewer that the experiment is not strong enough to be included and agree
to remove this supplementary figure if it is consensual.
We are still in the process of identifying founders and it will take a long time to reach
the F2 generation where we can analyse the true mutants. For this reason, it is not
feasible to wait for these results to be included in the current paper.
Regarding the use of adult crispr mutants to test the role of Foxj1a during regeneration,
we don’t believe that will be possible even when we have the mutant line established.
Embryos injected with the Foxj1a morpholino do not survive beyond the larval stages
and therefore it is not expected that the crispr mutants will be able to survive until
adulthood.
“3) In Results, the description of how the compression injury protocol
should briefly introduced to the non-specialist. In addition, explain in text how the
area of regeneration is the section being followed.”
We have included in the text a brief description of the injury protocol and which
regions of the injured spinal cord were analysed (page 11).
“4) The phenotype in lumen closure in Foxj1a morphants is described and related to
increased Shh activity. Are cilia lost in the morphants? From the morphant phenotype
during development, it seems that Foxj1a promotes differentiation or at least low levels
of Foxj1a induce progenitor proliferation. However, this seems to be the opposite
during regeneration. Please, discuss this.”
Regarding the presence of cilia in the morphants, we have not looked
extensively into this because it had been previously shown that Foxj1a knockdown
results in a decrease in the number of motile cilia in the developing neural tube (Yu et
al., 2008). However, our qualitative analysis of cilia in the Foxj1a morphants revealed
a reduction in cilia distribution at 24 and 30 hpf when compared to controls, indicating
that cilia formation is impaired upon Foxj1a knockdown (data not shown).
Regarding the role of Foxj1a during development vs. regeneration, we agree with the
reviewer that our results appear contradictory. Our work suggests that Foxj1a is
involved in the transition from proliferation to differentiation during neural tube
development, but in regenerating adult spinal cord foxj1a transcripts are present in
high levels in proliferating ependymal cells. However, this observation means only that
there is a correlation between proliferation and Foxj1a upregulation, but does not allow
us to draw conclusions about the role of Foxj1a during differentiation/regeneration. To
better understand how Foxj1a participates in this process it will be necessary to target
Foxj1a function in the adult. Although the use of adult crispr mutants may not be
possible (see response to comment 2 Reviewer 3), we can use in-vivo morpholinos to
knockdown Foxj1a in adult tissues. This experiment would allow us to determine if the
relationship between Foxj1a and the Shh signalling pathway is maintained in the adult
and if Foxj1a is required for the transition to differentiation, or if the embryonic role of
Foxj1a is not conserved in the adult.
This question about the possible roles of Foxj1a during regeneration has been
included in the discussion (page 16).
“5) In non-regenerative adult spinal cord, there are ependymal cells proliferating cells?
Are those Foxj1a?
In homeostasis, there are very few cells proliferating in the adult spinal cord. As
can be seen in the quantification shown in Figure 6B’, a few PCNA+ cells can be found
close to the ependymal region of control spinal cords, but these cells are GFP low or
negative and are not contacting the lumen.
“6) the authors make a strong case stating that studying Foxj1a cells in zebrafish can
provide better information why in zebrafish can give rise to neurons and not in
mammals, thus it seems that the reporter line could be a good tool for studying
ependymal regeneration. At the end, we find that this reporter does not respond to
injury cues, thus is not good for regenerative experiments. Altogether, there is a bit of
a deception for the arguments posed at the introduction and they could adjust the intro
for this.”
In the introduction we make the point that Foxj1a could be a good marker to
follow the fate of ependymal cells during regeneration, but we do not mention
specifically the foxj1a:GFP reporter. Even though our work revealed that this
transgenic line is not ideal to label new ependymal cells, we still believe that the gene
Foxj1a can be a useful marker, but a better reporter needs to be developed. We have
included this conclusion in the Discussion, arguing that we should identify the
complete Foxj1a promoter sequence in order to be able to perform lineage-tracing of
the ependymal descendants and understand how they contribute to spinal cord
regeneration (page 17).

Abstract
Zebrafish are able to regenerate the spinal cord and recover motor and sensory functions upon
severe injury, through the activation of cells located at the ependymal canal. Here, we show that
cells surrounding the ependymal canal in the adult zebrafish spinal cord express Foxj1a. We
demonstrate that ependymal cells express Foxj1a from their birth in the embryonic neural tube
and that Foxj1a activity is required for the final positioning of the ependymal canal. We also show
that in response to spinal cord injury, Foxj1a ependymal cells proliferate and contribute to the
restoration of the spinal cord structure. Finally, this study reveals that Foxj1a expression in the
injured spinal cord is regulated by regulatory elements activated during regeneration. These data
establish Foxj1a as a pan-ependymal marker in development, homeostasis and regeneration and
may help identify the signals that enable this progenitor population to replace lost cells after
spinal cord injury.

Introduction
The spinal cord develops from the embryonic neural tube, an initially homogeneous
neuroepithelium. During development, progenitor cells in the neural tube acquire different
identities depending on their position along the dorso-ventral axis. The roof plate on the dorsal
side (via BMPs and Wnts) and the floor plate on the ventral side (via Shh) provide positional
information that assigns cells to distinct progenitor domains (Jessell, 2000; Helms and Johnson,
2003). Each progenitor domain can give rise to several cell fates that emerge sequentially. The
initial step in neuroepithelial patterning specifies different neuronal subtypes. Soon after, the
progenitor region switches from a neuronal to a glial fate and begins generating oligodendrocytes
and astrocytes that support neurons (Rowitch and Kriegstein, 2010). After the differentiation and
migration of neurons and glial cells from the neuroepithelium, the remaining cells now lining the
central canal give rise to an additional cell fate - ependymal cells. Ependymal cells (i.e. all the cells
that contact the central canal) descend predominantly from the ventral progenitor domains p2
and pMN (Fu et al., 2003; Masahira et al., 2006) and the floor plate (Khazanov et al., 2016) and
require the ventral signal Shh for their correct specification (Yu et al., 2013).
As the remnant of the embryonic neuroepithelium, the ependymal region in the adult spinal cord
retains not only the pseudo-stratified epithelial organization, but also a stem/progenitor
character. These cells have neurosphere-forming capacity and are able to give rise to neurons,
astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in vitro, both in mouse (Johansson et al., 1999; Meletis, et al.,
2008) and human (Dromard et al., 2008; Mothe et al., 2011). By contrast, in vivo ependymal cells
display a more restricted lineage potential, in the context of spinal cord injury. Upon damage to
the spinal cord ependymal cells show a strong proliferative response, but fail to generate neurons,
forming mostly astrocytes that incorporate the glial scar and a small number of oligodendrocytes
(Mothe and Tator, 2005; Meletis et al., 2008). The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo
data suggests that neural stem cells in the ependymal region have the potential to replace all lost
cells, including neurons, but the neuronal fate is inhibited by the microenvironment in the injured
spinal cord. Therefore, if these inhibitory signals were removed it could be possible to direct the
endogenous stem cells towards a neuronal lineage.
In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish are able to efficiently regenerate the spinal cord due to
its ability to regrow damaged axons and form new neurons, while avoiding the formation of a glial

scar (Fleisch et al., 2011). Injury-induced neurons arise from the ependymal region (Reimer et al.,
2008), suggesting that stem/progenitor cells in the zebrafish spinal cord have a wider
regenerative potential than in mammals and could be used to identify the signals that help
promote the neuronal fate.
The study of the behaviour of zebrafish ependymal cells during regeneration would be facilitated
by the use of ependymal-specific molecular markers, but these are limited in zebrafish. A good
candidate is Foxj1, which is specifically expressed by ependymal cells in the mouse spinal cord
(Meletis et al., 2008) and is also detected in the ependymal zone in the human spinal cord (Garcia-
Ovejero et al., 2015). Moreover, Foxj1-expressing cells were shown to enter into a proliferative
state after spinal cord injury contributing mainly to astrocytes in vivo but with the ability to
differentiate into other cell types, including neurons, when cultured in vitro (Meletis et al., 2008).
In zebrafish, the Foxj1 homologue - Foxj1a - is expressed in the floor plate of the developing spinal
cord (Yu et al., 2008) and was shown to be elevated after injury in embryos (Hellman et al., 2010).
Yet, the cellular details of the Foxj1a distribution and response to injury in the adult spinal cord
were not explored.
In this study we determined if Foxj1a can be used to identify ependymal cells and whether Foxj1a-
expressing cells participate in the repair of the spinal cord. We report that Foxj1a expression in the
ependymal region is conserved in zebrafish and accompanies ependymal cells from their genesis
until adulthood. We also show that Foxj1 activity is important for the formation of the central
canal, through the modulation of the Shh signalling pathway. Moreover, we confirm that Foxj1a-
positive cells expand in response to injury through a Shh-dependent mechanism and contribute
to the restoration of the spinal cord structure in zebrafish.
Results
Adult zebrafish ERGs express Foxj1a
To determine if Foxj1a is expressed in the adult zebrafish spinal cord we used the reporter
transgenic line Tg(0.6foxj1a:GFP), in which a small enhancer sequence drives the expression of the
fluorescent protein GFP (Caron et al., 2012). This transgenic line was shown to reproduce Foxj1a
endogenous expression in several tissues, including the developing neural tube. In transverse

sections of the adult spinal cord the Foxj1a reporter labelled most cells surrounding the central
canal - ependymal cells (Figure 1A,A’). The majority of GFP+ ependymal cells had ependymo-
radial glia (ERG) morphology (Becker and Becker, 2015), with projections that extended to the
pial surface (Figure 1A-B’). We also confirmed by fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization (FISH) on
transgenic sections that the distribution of the foxj1a:GFP reporter is similar to the endogenous
foxj1a gene, which is also detected in the cells surrounding the central canal (Figure 1C-C’’’).
A general feature of ependymal cells is the presence of cilia and Foxj1(a) is associated with the
formation of motile cilia (Brody et al., 2000; Chen et al., 1998; Stubbs et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008).
To determine if Foxj1a+ ependymal cells in zebrafish are ciliated we labelled cilia with acetylated
<U+0251>-tubulin, which revealed long cilia projecting into the central canal (Figure 1 D,D’). At a closer
view, we detected one or two cilia per ependymal cell (Supplementary Figure 1). Transmission
electron microscopy revealed that most cilia at the apical edge of cells around the central canal
had a central pair of microtubules (n=21/25) (Figure 1E, arrow), as well as outer dynein arms
(Figure 1E, arrowhead). These results confirm that cells lining the central canal have long and
likely motile cilia, features that are consistent with the expression of Foxj1a.
The adult zebrafish ependymal region was previously shown to retain an embryonic-like pattern
of expression of several progenitor markers (Reimer et al., 2009). To assess the dorso-ventral
identity of Foxj1a+ cells we tested the expression of ventral marker Nkx6.1. This analysis showed
the expression of Foxj1a in both the Nkx6.1+ ventral half of the ERGs and in the Nkx6.1-negative
dorsal region that corresponded to a Pax6+ domain (Figure 1F,F’). Foxj1a expression was also
more widespread in the ependymal region than that of other molecular markers associated with
radial glial cells (GFAP and Vimentin; Supplementary Figure 2). Foxj1a+ ERGs were also in close
proximity to blood vessels (Figure 1G; Supplementary Figure 2), which provide support to neural
stem cell niches (Shen et al., 2008; Tavazoie et al., 2008). These data settle Foxj1a as a general
ependymal marker that labels a heterogeneous group of immature/progenitor cells.
Although the majority of cells surrounding the central canal had a radial glial morphology, a
subset of foxj1a:GFP-expressing cells displayed a more rounded morphology with a bulbous
apical attachment (Figure 1H’’). This morphology is reminiscent of cerebrospinal-fluid-contacting
neurons (CSF-cN) (Djenoune et al., 2014). To test if Foxj1a is expressed in CSF-cNs we examined
the expression of the early neuronal marker HuC/D and a CSF-cN-specific marker, polycystic

kidney disease 2-like 1 (PKD2L1) (Djenoune et al., 2014). This analysis showed that foxj1a:GFP+
cells with CSF-cN morphology express HuC/D (Figure 1H-H’’’) and pkd2l1 (Figure 1I-I’’), indicating
that Foxj1a is expressed not only in ERGs, but also in CSF-contacting neurons.
This initial characterization of Foxj1a expression in the adult zebrafish spinal cord demonstrated
that, as in mammals, Foxj1a is expressed in the cells that line the central canal, which we broadly
term as ependymal cells. The Foxj1a+ population is composed of various cell types, including
different subtypes of radial glial progenitors and more differentiated CSF-cNs (Figure 1J).
However, despite the common expression of Foxj1, zebrafish and mammalian ependymal cells
show some differences. Namely in the distribution of markers such as GFAP (absent in mouse)
and Vimentin (more widespread in mouse) and in the proportion of cells with radial morphology
(lower numbers in mouse) (Meletis et al., 2008).
Foxj1a is expressed in the ERG precursors in the developing neural tube
We next asked if Foxj1a plays a role in the assembly of the ependymal region during neural tube
development. Foxj1(a) is expressed in the embryonic floor plate (Yu et al., 2008; Cruz et al., 2010)
and roof plate (Nitzan et al., 2016). In zebrafish, floor plate and roof plate cells participate in
contraction of the primitive lumen to form the central canal (Kondrychyn et al., 2013), which
occurs between 48 and 72 hours-post-fertilization (hpf) as neural precursors exit the ventricular
zone (Hudish et al., 2013).
To determine if Foxj1a is expressed in the cells that help form the central canal, we examined the
behaviour of foxj1a:GFP+ cells during this embryonic period. The tight-junction protein ZO-1 was
used to reveal the outline of the primitive lumen. Expression of the reporter transgene was
detectable in the floor plate at 24 hpf (Figure 2A,A’) and continued to be expressed in the ventral
midline in the subsequent time-points analysed (Figure 2B-F’). At 48 hpf foxj1a:GFP started to be
expressed in roof plate cells (Figure 2B,B’), indicating that the expression pattern observed in
chick is conserved in zebrafish (Nitzan et al., 2016). Endogenous foxj1a expression in the roof
plate was confirmed by FISH in sections of 54 hpf embryos (Figure 2H). However, the analysis of
the distribution of foxj1a transcripts also uncovered a domain of foxj1a expression that was not
reproduced by the reporter transgene - a region of strong expression in the middle of the neural
tube (Figure 2H, Supplementary Figure 3). Nevertheless, the reporter could still be used to follow
6
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Page 7 of 36 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
the behavior of the roof plate and floor plate during lumen contraction. At 52 hpf, the roof plate
started to extend as the primitive lumen started to contract, and the apical projection of roof
plate cells continued to stretch until the conversion of the lumen into the central canal was
completed by 72 hpf (Figure 2C-E’). By contrast, the floor plate showed little change during this
process. The quantification of the size of the lumen in different embryos showed that the
reduction of the lumen reproducibly occurred from 48 to 72 hpf, with a dorsal-to-ventral zipping
mechanism (Figure 2G). After lumen contraction at 72 hpf the size of the ventral and dorsal
regions remained constant until the last time-point analysed, 120 hpf (Figure 2F,F’).
The initiation of Foxj1a expression in the neural tube also coincided with the appearance of long
cilia. When Foxj1a started to be expressed in the floor plate (24 hpf) and the roof plate (48 hpf)
GFP+ cells exhibited long cilia (Figure 2I-J’). The correlation between Foxj1a expression and
appearance of long cilia is consistent with the role of Foxj1a in the regulation of motile
ciliogenesis.
These results show that Foxj1a is expressed in ERG precursors in the floor plate, roof plate and in
cells close to the lumen in the middle region, which continue to surround the central canal after
lumen contraction. These data also revealed that the foxj1a:GFP reporter transgene is expressed
only in a subset of the endogenous foxj1a domains (floor plate and roof plate) in the neural tube,
indicating that the enhancer in the construct lacks some of the foxj1a regulatory elements.
Loss of Foxj1a activity affects the timing of lumen contraction
To test if Foxj1a is required for the transition from primitive lumen to central canal we examined
the morphology of the lumen (visualized with ZO-1) in larvae injected with antisense morpholino
oligonucleotides (MO) designed to block Foxj1a protein translation by targeting the start codon
(Dutta et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2008) (Supplementary Figure 3). We first analysed
larvae at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf), which showed a round and narrow lumen when injected
with a standard control MO (Figure 3A,A’). By contrast, foxj1a MO-injected larvae exhibited an
elongated lumen, indicating that lumen contraction was delayed when compared to the controls
(Figure 3D,D’,G,G’). The degree of the delay varied between morphant larvae, but the size of the
lumen was significantly larger and the dorsal region significantly smaller when compared to
7

Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY Page 8 of 36
controls (Figure 3J,K). These data suggest that the delay in lumen contraction observed in
morphants results from a lagging dorsal zipping.
To determine if foxj1a morphants are able to complete the zipping of the lumen, we analysed
MO-injected larvae at 5 dpf. At this stage control larvae displayed a small and ventrally positioned
central canal (Figure 3B,B’). In morphant larvae the size of the lumen was equivalent to controls,
but the position of the canal was altered (Figure 3J,K). In foxj1a morphants with a milder
phenotype the position of the central canal was only modestly dorsalized (Figure 3E,E’), but in
more severe phenotypes the canal was displaced to the middle of the spinal cord (Figure 3H,H’).
The measurement of the size of the ventral region showed that floor plate cells in the morphant
had stretched significantly (Figure 3J,K). These results indicate that the lumen size phenotype
observed in 3 dpf morphants is caused by a delay that ultimately affects the final position of the
canal. The co-injection of the foxj1a MO with a MO-resistant form of the foxj1a mRNA resulted in
the rescue of the curved body phenotype and the position of the central canal in a subset of larvae
(Supplementary Figures 4 and 5). Moreover, the injection of Cas9/gRNA complexes targeting the
foxj1a locus resulted in a small number of larvae with a curved body and a central canal shifted
dorsally (Supplementary Figure 6). Together, these data argue that the morphant phenotype is
specific to Foxj1a downregulation.
To determine if the dorsalization of the central canal in foxj1a morphants affects the identity of
the cells encircling the canal, we analysed the expression of the ventral marker Nkx6.1. At 5 dpf,
Nkx6.1 was expressed in cells lining the ventral side of the central canal in both control and
morphant larvae (Figure 3C,C’, F,F’, I,I’), suggesting that the dorso-ventral identity of ependymal
cells was not changed by the loss of Foxj1a function.
Together, these results indicate that Foxj1a activity influences the position of the central canal,
but not the specification of the ependymal precursor cells surrounding the canal.
Foxj1a attenuates Shh activity and prolongs the proliferative phase
The lumen closure phenotype observed in foxj1a morphants was reminiscent of larvae lacking the
microRNA miR-219 (Hudish et al., 2013). In miR-219 morphants the extended lumen was
associated with enhanced Shh activity and Shh-induced proliferation (Hudish et al., 2016). To test
8
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Page 9 of 36 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
if Foxj1a also affects the activity of the Shh pathway we assayed the expression of the Shh target
gene patched2 (Concordet et al., 1996) by FISH in 54 hpf embryos, when the lumen is closing.
Standard MO-injected larvae presented a ventral-to-dorsal accumulation of patched2 transcripts
near the lumen (Figure 4A,C), which was increased in foxj1a morphants (Figure 4B,D). This
increase in the expression of a Shh target gene in the absence of Foxj1a is consistent with the
hypothesis that Foxj1 dampens Shh signal transduction (Cruz et al., 2010). The increase in
patched2 expression is not a result of increased shh levels in the floor plate of foxj1a morphants,
as assessed by FISH (Supplementary Figure 7).
The Shh signalling pathway has both patterning and mitogenic roles in the neural tube (Ulloa and
Briscoe, 2007) and the attenuation of Shh activity is required for progenitor cells to exit the cell
cycle and differentiate (Hudish et al., 2016). To test if the loss of Foxj1a affects the transition from
proliferation to differentiation, we quantified the number of mitotic cells (labelled by phospho-
Histone H3 - pHH3) in control and morphant 54 hpf embryos. At this stage, very few mitotic cells
were detected in the neural tube of Standard MO embryos (0.1744 ± 0.0437 cells/section) (Figure
4E,G), but in foxj1a morphants the number of pHH3+ cells was significantly increased (1.25 ±
0.1326 cells/section) (Figure 4F,G). This result suggests that a decrease in Foxj1a activity leads to
an extended period of neural progenitor proliferation, likely due to the ectopic activation of the
Shh pathway. This delay in the transition to differentiation may explain the delay in lumen closure
observed in Foxj1a morphants. Together, these data propose a role for Foxj1a in the triggering of
progenitor cell cycle exit and induction of lumen contraction, through the modulation of the Shh
signal transduction.
Foxj1a-expressing cells participate in the regeneration of the spinal cord
To determine if adult zebrafish Foxj1a+ ependymal cells contribute to the repair of the spinal cord
after an injury, we examined the proliferative response of Fox1a+ cells after a compression injury
protocol. In this protocol, the vertebral column was exposed and the spinal cord was compressed
along the dorso-ventral axis using forceps (Hui et al., 2010). The site of the injury and the adjacent
rostral and caudal regions (350 µm from the injury centre) were analysed in transverse sections.
Proliferation was assayed using a PCNA antibody to label cells in G1 and S phases of the cell cycle
(Reimer et al., 2008). In adult fish that had undergone only sham-injury the number of PCNA+
cells was very low (Figure 5A). The quantification of number and position of PCNA and GFP-

expressing cells, plotted in a composite map of all samples, showed foxj1a:GFP+ cells around the
central canal and very few PCNA+ cells (Figure 5A’,H). At 3 and 7 days-post-injury (dpi) the
sections at the injury site were too disrupted to analyse, therefore only the adjacent sections were
quantified. At 3 dpi the number of proliferating cells had significantly increased (Figure 5B,H) and
dividing foxj1a:GFP+ ERGs around the central canal composed almost 50% of all proliferating cells
(47.05% ± 4.2%) (Figure 5B’). At day 7 the number of proliferating cells had further increased, but
the proportion of PCNA+ cells that expressed foxj1a:GFP was lower than at 3 dpi (23.5% ± 7%)
(Figure 5C,C’,H). The expansion of the ependymal area argued that new ependymal cells were
being formed, but not all new cells expressed foxj1a:GFP. The transgene was also downregulated
in new neurons as they left the ependymal zone and remained expressed only in CSF-contacting
neurons (Supplementary Figure 8). At 14 dpi a large number of cells, mostly foxj1a:GFP-low or
negative, was still proliferating at the injury epicentre (Figure 5E,E’,H), but the number of dividing
cells had decreased in adjacent regions (Figure 5D,D’,H). By 30 dpi, the ependymal zone remained
expanded, but the number of proliferating cells had considerably decreased, both far and close to
the injury (Figure 5F-G’,H). The dynamic behaviour of ERGs contrasted with the population of
CSF-cNs in the ependymal region, which remained almost unchanged in response to injury
(Supplementary Figure 9).
These data reveal that the Foxj1a+ ERG population is sensitive to injury and initiates a proliferative
program that contributes to the expansion of the ependymal area. However, the presence of
GFP-low or negative cells in the ependymal region raised the possibility that Foxj1a expression
was not induced in new ERGs or that the reporter transgene was not responsive in these cells
because it lacks the necessary regulatory elements, as observed in the embryonic neural tube.
Shh signalling activity induces Foxj1a expression during regeneration
To determine if foxj1a:GFP expression reproduced endogenous foxj1a in proliferating ERGs during
regeneration, we compared the expression of the GFP reporter and the distribution of foxj1a
transcripts in 7 dpi spinal cords. In sham-injury spinal cords, foxj1a:GFP labelled all cells around
the central canal (Figure 6A,A’). In adjoining sections, FISH for foxj1a revealed low levels of
transcripts distributed around the central canal (Figure 6B,B’). In injured spinal cords the
foxj1a:GFP reporter displayed high levels in the ventral and dorsal regions and low or absent
expression in the middle region where most PCNA+ cells were located (Figure 6C,C’). The reverse
10
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Page 11 of 36 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
pattern was seen for foxj1a transcripts: high transcript levels in the PCNA+ lateral cells and low
signal in the dorsal and ventral regions (Figure 6D,D’). These data show that Foxj1a is highly
expressed by proliferating cells after an injury, confirming that Foxj1a+ ERGs actively participate
in the repair of the lesioned spinal cord. In addition, these results reveal that the upregulation of
foxj1a expression in response to injury is not replicated by the reporter transgene, suggesting that
the injury-dependent expression of Foxj1a requires regulatory regions that are not present in the
promoter sequence used in this transgenic line.
The activation of Foxj1a expression in new ependymal cells during regeneration raises the
question of whether the injury-associated expression of Foxj1a is modulated by the signals used
during development. Since in the developing neural tube Foxj1a expression in the floor plate is
regulated by the Shh signalling pathway (Yu et al., 2008), we examined Foxj1a expression in
lesioned spinal cords exposed to an inhibitor of the Shh pathway - Cyclopamine. This experiment
was carried out in larvae, which are more tractable than adults in terms of compound delivery and
tissue penetrance (Bhatt et al., 2004; Briona and Dorsky, 2014; Ohnmacht et al., 2016). We
performed spinal cord transection in 5 dpf Tg(0.6foxj1a:GFP) larvae (Figure 6E) and confirmed
that foxj1a expression is also induced after spinal cord injury in 3 dpi larvae (Figure 6G,I).
Moreover, the distribution of foxj1a transcripts coincided with the accumulation of PCNA+ cells
induced by the lesion (Figure 6F,H), resembling the adult spinal cord.
We next examined the role of the Shh pathway in the upregulation of foxj1a in the injured tissue.
Injured larvae were treated with 200 µM of Cyclopamine or an equivalent volume of DMSO from
day 1 to 3 post-injury (Figure 6J). The concentration of Cyclopamine used was sufficient to inhibit
injury-induced proliferation in larvae (Supplementary Figure 10). foxj1a expression was detected
by FISH in spinal cord sections of injured larvae and the florescence intensity of foxj1a transcripts
was quantified in cells along the dorso-ventral axis (Figure 6K). In DMSO-treated larvae foxj1a
transcripts were present at high levels in cells lining the lumen (Figure 6L), with peak intensity at
middle/dorsal positions (Figure 6N,O). By contrast, the fluorescence intensity levels of foxj1a
transcripts were dampened in larvae exposed to Cyclopamine (Figure 6M), with significantly
lower levels in the middle/dorsal region when compared to the controls (Figure 6N,O). This result
suggests that Shh signalling activity is required for the injury-dependent expression of Foxj1a in
ependymal cells.
11

Together, these data reveal that activation of the Shh signalling pathway after injury triggers
upregulation of Foxj1a expression and promotes proliferation in the regenerating spinal cord.
Discussion
Ependymal cells were viewed simply as the lining of the central canal until the discovery of neural
stem cells within this spinal cord population (Johansson et al., 1999; Dromard et al., 2008). The
identification of resident stem cells in the mammalian spinal cord led to a new therapeutic
perspective in which ependymal cells could be used as an alternative to stem cell transplantation
to help replace cell types lost after spinal cord injury (Sabelström et al., 2014). However, further
work is needed to understand how to overcome the astrocytic differentiation bias of these
endogenous stem cells and to favour their differentiation into new neurons. Insight may be
gained from the study of organisms that are able to spontaneously form new neurons and regain
motor function after spinal cord injury, such as zebrafish (Reimer et al., 2008).
Here, we identify Foxj1a as a general ependymal marker in zebrafish that can help follow the
response of ependymal cells during spinal cord regeneration. Unlike other described molecular
markers such as Sox2, GFAP and Vimentin (Hui et al., 2015), Foxj1a is not restricted to subsets of
ependymal cells. The expression of Foxj1a in the adult zebrafish spinal cord, together with the
expression of other ependymal markers, reinforces the molecular similarities of stem/progenitor
cells found in zebrafish and mammals. Nevertheless, when comparing our results obtained in
zebrafish with the ones reported in mouse we could see differences in the ependymal region in
terms of protein distribution (GFAP and Vimentin) and radial glial morphology, which may be
associated with differences in cellular function and could have an impact on their regenerative
potential. We further show that Foxj1a is expressed by neurons that maintain attachments to the
apical surface (CSF-contacting neurons), indicating that Foxj1a labels not just ERGs but all cells
contacting the central canal.
This study also reveals that Foxj1a is expressed in ependymal cells not only in the adult spinal cord
but from the time of formation of the central canal in the embryonic neural tube. We show that
Foxj1a is induced in the floor plate and roof plate before the initiation of lumen contraction.
Foxj1a is also expressed in a subset of cells lining the lumen in the middle region of the neural
tube. The
12

Page 13 of 36 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
different domains of Foxj1a-expressing cells later contribute to the ependymal region after the
narrowing of the lumen. Although the expression of Foxj1 in the floor plate (in mouse, Cruz et al.,
2010) and in the roof plate (in chick, Nitzan et al., 2016) had been reported previously, here we
show for the first time that Foxj1a expression is maintained in these two domains and in the
previously unreported middle domain until the formation of the central canal. Moreover, we show
that Foxj1a remains expressed in the ependymal region until adulthood.
Foxj1a is not only expressed by the cells that make up the ependymal zone, but is also required for
the correct positioning of the central canal. In the absence of Foxj1a activity the dorsal to ventral
zipping of the lumen is delayed resulting in a dorsally located canal. Foxj1a appears to be involved
in the attenuation of the Shh-dependent mitogenic activity that is necessary for cells to exit the
cell cycle and migrate away from the ventricular zone (Hudish et al., 2016). If this transition is
affected, progenitor cells remain longer in the ventricular zone and the constriction of the
primitive lumen is stalled. Although delayed, lumen contraction is completed in Foxj1a
morphants. However, the final position of the central canal is moved dorsally, through a
mechanism that is still unclear. The expanded Shh activity may affect the timing of differentiation
along the dorso-ventral axis, either by delaying the transition from proliferation to cell cycle exit
or by changing the dorso-ventral identity of progenitor cells, which influences their rate of
differentiation (Kicheva et al., 2014). If cells exit the lumen at the wrong time and/or order and the
zipping of the lumen is not coordinated (for example, ventral and dorsal cells exiting at the same
time), the central canal can end up in the wrong position. Nevertheless, the shifted ependymal
region in the Foxj1a morphants displays a normal dorso-ventral pattern, suggesting that
ependymal cells originate from the correct progenitor domains. However, we cannot confirm that
ependymal specification occurred without defects, since we did not test markers associated with
mature ependymal cells. Therefore, further work is needed to assess if Foxj1a is required for the
differentiation of ependymal cells, as shown in the mouse brain (Jacquet et al., 2009). The
mechanism through which Foxj1a dampens Shh signalling activity is also not known. The role of
Foxj1 in the attenuation of Shh activity had been previously proposed in the chick neural tube
(Cruz et al., 2010), although the later effect on the position of the central canal had not been
described. Foxj1 function in Shh pathway regulation is expected to involve changes in cilia
structure that affect signal transduction downstream of Shh binding and make cells less
responsive to Shh (Cruz et al., 2010).
13

Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY Page 14 of 36
Foxj1a expression is also activated in new ependymal cells formed in response to injury, as had
been suggested in embryos (Hellman et al., 2010). Injury-induced proliferation is first detected in
the Foxj1a+ ependymal zone and results in the expansion of the ependymal layer. Many of the
newly added ependymal cells continue to proliferate and reinforce the expression of Foxj1a,
suggesting that these cells maintain a progenitor status. The upregulation of Foxj1a levels in the
injured spinal cord depends on Shh activity, arguing that the regulation of Fox1a expression
during regeneration relies on the same cues used during development. Shh expression is also
increased in response to injury (Reimer et al., 2009), but the trigger for the upregulation of Shh
levels is still unknown. Shh activity also promotes proliferation in the regenerating spinal cord and
it will be of interest to investigate if Foxj1a function is required for the injury-induced proliferation
or if, conversely, it is involved in the transition to differentiation in resemblance with its role
during development.
The characterization of Foxj1a+ cells during spinal cord development and repair also revealed that
the foxj1a:GFP reporter, which uses a 600bp regulatory sequence to drive GFP expression (Caron
et al., 2012), only partially reproduces the endogenous foxj1a expression. In the developing neural
tube the reporter transgene fails to label Foxj1a+ cells in the middle region and in the regenerating
spinal cord the reporter is not induced in ependymal cells formed after injury. These results
indicate that additional regulatory elements are necessary to fully reproduce endogenous Foxj1a
expression, but further work is needed to identify these elements. It will be of particular interest
to investigate if Foxj1a expression in response to injury requires dedicated regulatory sequences.
Regeneration-specific enhancer elements were recently reported in zebrafish in the context of
heart and caudal fin regeneration (Kang et al., 2016) and our data suggest that Foxj1a expression
during spinal cord regeneration may also be regulated by specific enhancers.
A better understanding of the Foxj1a regulatory regions will also be important to develop new
tools to follow ependymal cells after an injury. It is known that ependymal cells not only self-
renew in response to injury, but also give rise to new neurons (Reimer et al., 2008). Given that
Foxj1a is expressed by the majority of cells in the ependymal region, it is likely that Foxj1a+ cells
are able to generate neurons. However, we were unable to identify the progeny of Foxj1a+ cells
using the Tg(0.6foxj1a:GFP) transgenic line, due to the rapid downregulation of GFP expression in
differentiated cells. To track the fate of Foxj1a descendants after they leave the ependymal
region it will be necessary to use a lineage-tracing approach, which will require a reliable Foxj1a
14

promotor sequence. The lineage-tracing of Foxj1a+ cells will help confirm if ERGs are multipotent
(generating neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) and if all new neurons formed after injury
arise from the ependymal population. In addition, the complete Foxj1a promoter can also be used
to create cell ablation transgenic lines to evaluate the contribution of the ependymal population
to the repair of the damaged tissue.
The role of Foxj1 as an ependymal marker is well established in amniotes (Meletis et al., 2008;
Jacquet et al., 2009). Our study demonstrates that this role is conserved in zebrafish and shows
that Foxj1a expression in ependymal cells is initiated in the developing spinal cord. Foxj1a also has
an active role in the formation of the ependymal canal during development, through the
modulation of the Shh signalling pathway. Finally, this work shows that spinal cord injury induces
the formation of new ependymal cells that contribute to tissue repair and Foxj1a expression is
activated in these new cells through the use of specific regulatory elements. Thus, Foxj1 is a
useful marker to help understand how similar populations of cells - ependymal cells in zebrafish
and amniotes - display such strikingly different behaviours in response to injury that lead to
regeneration in zebrafish and scarring in amniotes.
Materials and Methods
Fish husbandry and zebrafish lines
Adult and embryo zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained at 28ºC in standard conditions. The
zebrafish transgenic lines used in this study were previously reported: Tg(0.6foxj1a:GFP) (Caron et
al., 2012), Tg(flk1:mCherry) (Hogan et al., 2009) and Tg(fli1:EGFP)y1 (Lawson and Weinstein, 2002).
Procedures with zebrafish were approved by the Portuguese DGV (Direção Geral de Veterinária).
Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) and mRNA microinjection
Foxj1a antisense MO (Yu et al., 2008; obtained from Gene Tools) and standard control MO (Gene
Tools) were injected in Tg(0.6foxj1a:GFP) embryos at the one-cell stage. Each embryo was
microinjected with a volume of 1.4 nl containing 2 ng of either Foxj1a or standard control MOs.
Foxj1a MO-injected embryos were screened at 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to select only
individuals displaying a curved body phenotype, which is indicative of problems in ciliogenesis
15

(Tian et al., 2009). To perform the rescue experiments one-cell stage embryos were injected with
2 ng of foxj1a MO alone or together with either 500 pg or 1 ng of a MO-resistant form of the full
length foxj1a mRNA.
Generation of a MO-resistant full length foxj1a mRNA
The MO-binding region of the foxj1a coding sequence was altered by introducing silent mutations
(Forward primer:5’ CGCGGGATCCGTCAGGACTATGTTAAGTATGTCTAGCA
TGGACCCCTGGCCGGA 3’; Reverse primer: 5’ GCGCGCGGCCGCAAAGCAGAGTCTCGATTTTAC
3’). The transcription of the full length mRNA was performed using the SP6 mMESSAGE
mMACHINE kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Generation of CRISPR gRNAs to target the foxj1a locus
Crispr gRNAs targeting the sequence coding the Forkhead domain of the foxj1a gene were
designed using the CrisprScan algorithm (Moreno-Mateus et al., 2015). The sgRNAs were
generated according to Gagnon et al., 2014. Briefly, gene-specific oligonucleotides containing the
T7 promoter, the target DNA sequence (underlined) and a complementary region (sgRNA_FD1:
5’-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCAGGTGGGATCTGCGTGGGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG-3’;
sgRNA_FD2: 5’-
TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCAGGTGGGATCTGCGTGGGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG-3’)
were annealed to an invariant oligonucleotide encoding the reverse-complement of the tracrRNA
tail (5’-
AAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTCAAGTTGATAACGGACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATT
TCTAGCTCTAAAAC-3’) and T4 DNA polymerase (NEB #M0203S) was used to fill in the ssDNA
overhangs. The double stranded sgRNA template was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen #28104) and transcribed using MEGAshortscript™ T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion
#AM1354). Finally, the sgRNAs were DNAse-treated and purified with phenol:chloroform
extraction followed by alcohol precipitation, according to the transcription kit. Cas9 protein was
produced by the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel as a purified batch at 1 mg/mL in 20 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 M KCl. For the gRNA/Cas9 microinjections, the two sgRNAs (FD1
and FD2) were mixed with Cas9 protein (360 ng/µl per sgRNA and 800 ng/µl of Cas9 protein) and
incubated at 37ºC for 5 minutes to allow for the sgRNA/Cas9 complexes to form. Embryos at one-
cell stage were injected with 1.4 nl of this solution.

Spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish
Adult zebrafish of either sex (4-12 month-old) were anesthetized by immersion in 0.016% tricaine
(MS222, Sigma) in tank water. A longitudinal incision was made on the side of anesthetized
zebrafish, midway between the base of the skull and the dorsal fin. After exposing the vertebral
column, the spinal cord was compressed dorsoventrally using forceps (Dumont #55, FST). The
wound was sealed with Vetbond (3M) and the fish allowed to recover in individual tanks. In
control fish a sham injury was performed by making an incision at the side of the animal but
leaving the spinal cord intact before sealing the wound.
Spinal cord injury and Cyclopamine treatment in zebrafish larvae
The protocol to perform spinal cord injury in zebrafish larvae was previously described (Briona
and Dorsky, 2014). Transgenic larvae (Tg(0.6foxj1a:GFP)) with 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) were
anesthetized in 0.016% tricaine in embryo medium and placed on their side in a drop of medium
in a Petri dish. The injury was performed at the level of the anal pore using a 20G x 1’’ syringe
needle (Terumo) to transect the region dorsal to the notochord that contains the spinal cord.
Injured larvae were carefully transferred to fresh embryo medium and maintained at 28ºC until
the time of analysis.
To inhibit the Shh signalling pathway in injured larvae, Cyclopamine (Sigma, C4116) was added at
a concentration of 200 µM to the medium one day after the injury and fresh medium with
Cyclopamine was added again at 2 dpi. A control group of injured larvae was treated with an
equivalent volume of DMSO (Cyclopamine vehicle). The drug-treated larvae were kept in the dark
at 28ºC until the time of analysis.
Histology
The vertebral column of adult zebrafish was dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at
4ºC overnight. After fixation the spinal cord was isolated from the vertebral column.
Embryos/larvae collected at different developmental stages were also fixed in 4% PFA at 4ºC
overnight. The samples were washed 3 x 5 min in PBS and equilibrated in 15% sucrose / 0.12M
phosphate buffer (PB) pH 7.2 solution at 4ºC overnight, embedded in 7.5% gelatin / 15% sucrose /
0.12M PB pH 7.2 at 42ºC and frozen. The samples were cryosectioned in 14 µm-thick slices and
processed for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The vertebral column of adult zebrafish was dissected and the spinal cord isolated from the
vertebrae before fixation overnight at 4ºC in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing
2,5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. Following 1 hour post-fixation in 1% (aq.) osmium tetroxide and 30
minutes contrast in block in 1% (aq.) uranyl acetate. Dehydration was made using ethanol
gradient (50-70-95-100%) and infiltration was aided using propylene oxide and a mixture (1:1) of
propylene oxide and EPON 812 resin (EMS). Samples were embedded in EPON resin and
hardened at 60ºC for 36h. Sections were obtained using an ultramicrotome Reichert Supernova
(Leica microsystems), semi-thin sections (500 nm) were stained with toluidine blue for light
microscope evaluation. Ultra-thin sections (70 nm) were collected in Formvar (AGAR scientific)
coated copper slot grids, and counter-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (Reynold
recipe), and screened in a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope at 100kV acceleration.
Immunohistochemistry
To perform immunostaining in sections the gelatin was removed from the cryosections using PBS
heated to 42ºC (4 x 5 min washes). After incubation with a blocking solution (1% Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA) in PBS / 0.01% Triton X-100 (PBSTx) ) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT), the
sections were incubated in primary antibody solution at 4ºC overnight. After 5 x 5 min washes in
PBSTx, the sections were incubated with the secondary antibody (1:1000 in blocking solution) and
1µg/ml DAPI (Sigma, D9564) for 2 hours at RT. Details of the primary and secondary antibodies
used are described in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. After incubation with the secondary
antibodies, the sections were washed in PBS and mounted in Mowiol mounting medium. Antigen
retrieval was performed for the anti-PCNA antibody by placing the slides in 10 mM sodium citrate
pH6 / 0.1% Triton X-100 and heating in a microwave at sub-boiling temperature for 5 min before
proceeding with gelatin removal and immunostaining.
In Situ Hybridization
in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed in sections using probes against foxj1a (Neugebauer et
al., 2009), pkd2l1 (kindly provided by Mónica Roxo-Rosa) or patched2 (Concordet et al., 1996).
Digoxigenin (DIG) or fluorescein (Fluo)-labelled probes were transcribed using T7 or SP6 RNA
polymerase (Roche). The ISH protocol followed was adapted from a described protocol (Lauter et
18
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Page 19 of 36 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
al., 2011) and is detailed in Supplementary information. In sections that were processed with a
colorimetric reaction the probe was developed using BM Purple AP substrate (Roche,
11442074001). In sections developed with a fluorescent reaction (FISH) the TSA Plus
TMR/Fluorescein system (PerkinElmer, NEL756001KT) was used instead, following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Nuclei were counterstained with 1µg/ml DAPI and the slides were
mounted in Mowiol medium. In some cases, the FISH was followed by immunostaining against
GFP or PCNA. In these sections, the development of the probe with the TSA plus system was
followed by the immunohistochemistry procedure described above.
Imaging
Immunostained and FISH sections were imaged in Zeiss LSM 710 or LSM 880 confocal
microscopes with Plan-Neofluor 40x/1.3 Oil or Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil objectives. Each
image is a maximum intensity projection of a z-stack acquired from the 14µm cryosection.
Images of the neural tube region in transverse sections of larvae were acquired at the level of
somites 5 to 10. The images of ISH sections developed with colorimetric reaction were acquired in
a Leica DM2500 brightfield microscope with a HCX PL FLUOTAR 100x/1.3 Oil objective. The
processing of acquired images was performed using the image analysis software Fiji (Schindelin
et al., 2012) and Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator were used for assembly of figures.
Quantification of lumen closure
The positions of the dorsal and ventral points of the lumen and the ventral and dorsal edges of
the neural tube (floor plate and roof plate respectively) were quantified manually using Fiji.
Matlab was used to register the positions in each neural tube to the centre of the lumen and to
plot the grouped positions according to stage (hpf) and condition (Foxj1a MO vs Standard MO).
GraphPad Prism 5 was used to generate the scatter plot of the size of the lumen and ventral and
dorsal regions and to perform statistical analysis between conditions.
Quantification of cell number and positions
The number of phospho-Histone H3+ cells per section was quantified manually and obtained data
was plotted and analysed statistically using GraphPad Prism 5.
The number and position of PCNA+ (or Hu+), foxj1a:GFP+ and DAPI+ cells in the injured spinal
cords were quantified using the 3D Objects Counter plugin available in Fiji (Bolte and Cordelières,
19
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY Page 20 of 36
2006). Briefly, a maximum projection image was generated from 3 optical sections with 1 µm
between sections. The image of the DAPI channel was then used to automatically segment
individual nuclei using the plugin. In nuclei that overlapped and were not be segmented
automatically, the boundary between nuclei was defined manually. The segmentation mask that
identified individual objects (nuclei) in the DAPI channel was then used to extract the
fluorescence intensity in the other two channels (GFP and PCNA/Hu). The plugin output included
the position of each nucleus and the average fluorescence intensity in the GFP and PCNA/Hu
channels. We defined that a nucleus was positive for a specific channel if the average intensity
was above the background levels (measured manually). Matlab was used to analyse the obtained
data and to generate scatter plots of cell positions for each time-point after injury (composite
maps).
GraphPad Prism 5 was used to plot the total number of different cell types per section, to
compare between different conditions and different time-points post-injury and to perform
statistical analysis.
Quantification of fluorescence intensity of foxj1a and shh transcripts
Images of sections labelled by FISH with a probe against foxj1a or shh were used to measure the
profiles of the fluorescence intensity of foxj1a or shh transcripts along the DV axis. A 10 µm-wide
box was placed on one of the sides of the lumen from the ventral to the dorsal edges of the neural
tube and the DV profile of foxj1a or shh fluorescence intensity (in arbitrary units, a.u) was
measured inside the box using the Plot Profile plugin in Fiji. Matlab was used to normalize the DV
positions to the size of the neural tube and to bin the raw fluorescence intensity values into 5%
intervals relative to the total size of the neural tube. The binned fluorescence intensity was
averaged between individuals and plotted in function of the relative DV position. Matlab was also
used to quantify the foxj1a or shh fluorescence intensity in different DV regions of the neural tube.
GraphPad Prism 5 was used to plot the average foxj1a fluorescence intensity in each region, to
compare between different conditions (DMSO vs Cyc) and perform statistical analysis.
