Firstly, I want to say this is an interesting paper that is advancing the field of biomarker
discovery. With the exception of the paragraph below, all points are relatively minor, and it is
this point alone that prevents me from recommending the paper for publication as it currently
stands.
I have a fundamental concern regarding the study design and the omission of an age matched
group to your model group. Many comparisons are made between the recovery group
(maintained for 8 weeks in total and fed the caloric restriction diet for 4 weeks) and the model
group (killed at 4 weeks). One example is when the claim is made that the recovery group
showed a significant reduction in both TCH and LDL-c (fig. 1). While this appears to be a cogent
conclusion, there is no way to be sure of disease progression in the model group after the 4 week
period. We have no way of knowing how levels of TCH and LDL-c would progress in a model
group maintained for the remaining 4 weeks on a normal diet, and therefore cannot conclude the
caloric restriction was the reason for the reduction in cholesterol levels. This is the same for all
other comparisons made between the model group at 4 weeks and the recovery group at 8 weeks.
I therefore recommend adding a model group not killed at 4 weeks, however maintained on a
normal diet. This way you can conclude, in age matched animals, that all improvements to
physiology observed were the result of caloric restriction alone. An alternative for this, is leaving
the disease regression story out of your paper, and focusing on biomarker discovery as you have
conducted some truly compelling research in this field.
For the IVUS imaging and histology, I was confused by the graph concerning the neointimal area
(fig. 2) as to whether a single comparison was made (between Model and Recovery) or multiple,
given that you have included the control group in the graph. If the latter is true, this should use a
one way ANOVA for comparisons, and not a Student's T-Test, as there are >2 group
comparisons. If the former is true, being more explicit with how your statistics were calculated
would be useful for the reader.
With regards to statistical analyses, you have opted for an ANOVA with Fisher's LSD test. As the
test does not account for multiple comparisons, the general consensus is to rarely recommend it.
You need to account for multiple comparisons when you interpret this data or reconcile this in
your methods section. I have recommended the paper be seen by a specialist statistician.
3
Some additional comments regarding study design on the microarray would be beneficial. For
example, the number of biological and technical replicates used. With this information, it would
be easier to discern whether the method of normalisation (Quantile) is suitable for your study
design.
The use of GAPDH as a housekeeper could potentially raise a flag. As with all tissue types, work
must be done to find a suitable reference gene. A brief literature review of reference genes in
ascending aortas of human patients suggests GAPDH to be one of the least stable genes tested.
They continue to suggest a few genes that might be of interest to your further work (PMID:
23326585). If GAPDH is indeed stable for your work, it would useful to show this in your paper.
This factors into the below comment with regards to error bars and n number.
Figure 6. requires annotation of the microarray graphs. Also, error bars are essential l in the RT-
PCR data, along with n number. If this is based on n=1 work, replicates are also essential.
I object to the phrase, "The results showed that our gene chip was reliable" as this is only based
on the validation of 4 genes. Consider using the phrase, "The results suggest that our gene chip
was reliable". This is a subtle change in language; but given my own work on validation of big
datasets, 4 genes is not enough to validate an entire dataset.
Overall, you provide a convincing evidence that your atherosclerosis model was established.
However, you do not convince me of a regression in atherosclerotic markers as a result of caloric
restriction. I believe your work on biomarker discovery is well polished and would need minimal
work before being publication ready. Moving forward, I would be happy to endorse this paper
once the above revisions were made, and without the caloric restriction element being added due
to the lack of controls.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
Yu et al relied upon a rabbit model of atherosclerosis in order to study a hypothesis of healing
(rescue) following caloric restriction. They provided histology and ultrasound in order to
physiologically profile control, injured and rescued rabbits and then performed a microarray
experiment in order to provide a molecular footprint of atherosclerosis in the rabbit aorta, and
determine how that footprint changed as a consequence of caloric restriction. They translated
these genes into humans with CAD.
The English and grammar is mostly okay throughout, but some small copyediting is required to
meet minimum standards.
Title:
I'm not sure the title is fit for purpose having read the study.
Introduction:
The introduction was concise, which is good, but would have benefitted from a more careful
description of the experiment in the final paragraph; for example, what tissue do the authors use?
Methods:
1. The model should be much better described so that it is explicit how the animals groups were
assigned and what the protocol was. The figure is informative, but the words should be clear
also.
2. The authors don't state whether the control was a sham or not, but I suspect it is not. If this is
indeed the case, I would like some justification for not using a sham model as a control, as the
gene changes may result from the surgery, and recovery and not from the model. This is a major
flaw in this study and needs to be carefully addressed.
3. Blood sampling - please state more detail regarding blood collection, how much was collected
and into what tube did you collect (EDTA?).
4. Sample collection - This section needs a more detailed protocol. I'm not clear from this which
tissue you used for the RNA extraction? Did you use fibrotic scars, normal looking tissue, a mix.
The relative homogeneity of the tissue is important, especially in light of the non-sham control.
5. Also, Stating 'Trizol method' does not do justice to the range of strategies for RNA collection.
Did you store the tissue in RNAlater? Did you purify directly on a column, or precipitate. when
you used the Aglient, what RIN cutoff did you get/apply?
6. Microarray analysis - I can't see any reference to Multiple test correction in this section. Also,
it's not clear whether you applied the statistical analysis before or after flag cuttoff. Please write a
detailed protocol.
7. In addition, I can't see any reference to the public repository that you have or will upload this
data into. Please consider sharing your data with ncbi GEO.
8. Please give the full name for DAVID, and not just the abbreviation.
9. qPCR - the authors do not state whether the samples processed for qPCR were independent
from those they performed the microarray on. If they are the same samples, this is a technical
validation and of little value.
10. Primers - The authors have used GAPDH as a calibrator in their PCR. Did they test this to
5
determine whether GAPDH is regulated in this tissue by the treatment, if it does (and it often
does), then this is a poor calibrator.
11. Human Serum - it is a big jump to suggest that gene expression in serum will reflect gene
expression in the aorta. This is a second major flaw in this paper that needs careful thought.
Results:
1. Figure 2 shows a graph where the neointimal area is significantly regulated between model
and recovery. My eye tells me that there are also changes between control and model and control
and recovery that are also significant. Please ensure that you have applied the appropriate
statistics here.
2. Figure 3 is too low a resolution for me to see differences. Please provide high resolution images
with better magnification.
3. DRG - please cite Treeview software.
4. Please provide the list of 3716 differentially regulated genes in a supplementary table.
5. Please ensure that the key for the heatmap is better. At present it is difficult to see.
6. Please ensure that the genes for each of the clusters is provided in a supplementary file.
7. Please ensure that the genes for each of the enriched GO analysis is provided.
8. Please give a better description of how you chose your 4 validation targets.
Discussion:
The discussion is too short because only four genes were revealed following a comprehensive
gene expression study. This discussion should have a more comprehensive discussion about the
genes found. Also, there is no real discussion about how the four genes might be biomarkers in
human blood AND in the aorta. Are there experimental reasons or are these biologically
important? This data has not been placed into the current understanding of atherosclerosis or
caloric restriction.

those killed at the 4-week mark in addition to the others (AS30 + AS60).

Appendix A
Dear Editors:
We are especially grateful to the editor and referees for their excellent comments
and helpful suggestions for increasing the breadth and impact of our original
article entitled “Large-scale gene analysis using a rabbit atherosclerosis model to
discover new biomarkers for human coronary artery disease” (ID:
label_version_3
RSOB-18-0148). All of the comments provided by the referees were constructive
and afforded us the ability to revise our manuscript accordingly. Please find our
replies, comments, and inclusions to the revised manuscript in sequence below.
Referee 1:
1. I have a fundamental concern regarding the study design and the omission of
an age matched group to your model group. Many comparisons are made
between the recovery group (maintained for 8 weeks in total and fed the caloric
restriction diet for 4 weeks) and the model group (killed at 4 weeks). One
example is when the claim is made that the recovery group showed a significant
reduction in both TCH and LDL-c (fig. 1). While this appears to be a cogent
conclusion, there is no way to be sure of disease progression in the model group
after the 4 week period. We have no way of knowing how levels of TCH and
LDL-c would progress in a model group maintained for the remaining 4 weeks
on a normal diet, and therefore cannot conclude the caloric restriction was the
reason for the reduction in cholesterol levels. This is the same for all other
comparisons made between the model group at 4 weeks and the recovery group
at 8 weeks. I therefore recommend adding a model group not killed at 4 weeks,
however maintained on a normal diet. This way you can conclude, in age
matched animals, that all improvements to physiology observed were the result
of caloric restriction alone. An alternative for this, is leaving the disease
regression story out of your paper, and focusing on biomarker discovery as you
have conducted some truly compelling research in this field.
Responses:
1) The referee is absolutely correct here. We apologize for our incorrect
statement that caloric restriction was the reason for the reduction in cholesterol
levels. In the revised manuscript, we deleted those conclusions.
We originally used a caloric restriction diet to accelerate the regression of
atherosclerosis. In our previous research, we found that TCH and LDL-c
concentrations were also reduced in rabbits fed a normal diet. The reductions
were not significant after feeding a normal diet for 4 weeks but became
significant after feeding a normal diet for 8 weeks (provided in the revised
Supplementary Figure 1). The results of IVUS detection also showed that the
lesion did not significantly reduce after feeding a normal diet for only 4 weeks
(provided in the revised Supplementary Figure 2). These results suggested that a
normal diet can induce the regression of atherosclerosis, although 8 weeks or
more may be required. According to previous reports, the addition of certain
substances such as s-HDL, paclitaxel or phosphatidylcholine into the normal diet
induced rapid regression of atherosclerosis [1-3]. Moreover, caloric restriction is
the most effective and reproducible intervention against atherosclerosis through
increasing HDL-c levels and decreasing TCH and LDL-c levels [4-6]. To speed
up the process, we designed an atherosclerosis rapid regression experiment using
a caloric restriction diet (reduced daily intake by 20 percent) instead of a normal
diet (ad libitum intake).
2) We sought to simultaneously compare the characteristics between progression
and regression of atherosclerosis. The progression of atherosclerosis was
compared between the model group and the control group, and the regression of
atherosclerosis was compared between the recovery group and the model group.
Thus, in Figure 1, we re-defined the “model group” as “AS30”, the “recovery
group” as “AS60”, and the “control group” as “AS0”. We hope that this change
allows a better understanding of the results.
3) Thank you very much for recommending an alternative solution. However, we
think that the comprehensive study of regression and progression together may
provide a solution for discovering important genes related to the diagnosis and
prognosis of atherosclerosis. We hope that the corrections in the revised
manuscript meet your approval. However, if the reviewer recommends, we can
remove the disease regression discussion from the paper and focus on biomarker
discovery.
2. For the IVUS imaging and histology, I was confused by the graph concerning
the neointimal area (fig. 2) as to whether a single comparison was made
(between Model and Recovery) or multiple, given that you have included the
control group in the graph. If the latter is true, this should use a one way ANOVA
for comparisons, and not a Student's T-Test, as there are >2 group comparisons.
If the former is true, being more explicit with how your statistics were calculated
would be useful for the reader.
Responses:
We have re-written this part according to the referee’s suggestion in P7, Line
18-22. The progression of atherosclerosis was compared between the model
group (AS30) and the control group (AS0), and the regression of atherosclerosis
was compared between the recovery group (AS60) and the model group (AS30).
We used Student's t test for comparisons.
3. With regards to statistical analyses, you have opted for an ANOVA with
Fisher's LSD test. As the test does not account for multiple comparisons, the
general consensus is to rarely recommend it. You need to account for multiple
comparisons when you interpret this data or reconcile this in your methods
section. I have recommended the paper be seen by a specialist statistician.
Responses:
We have consulted a professional statistician and have re-written the description
of the statistical analyses in the method section in the revised manuscript..
4. Some additional comments regarding study design on the microarray would be
beneficial. For example, the number of biological and technical replicates used.
With this information, it would be easier to discern whether the method of
normalization (Quantile) is suitable for your study design.
Responses:
We have re-written this part in the revised manuscript in P5, Line 25-26. We
selected one aorta sample from the control, model, and recovery groups for gene
chip analysis and used the quantile method for normalization.
We recognize that three biological replicates are optimal for the experiment.
However, considering the cost of 9 samples (£5500), we selected one
representative sample from each group for the microarray analysis. However, the
candidate genes were validated by RT-PCR in four samples from each group, and
the results showed that the gene chip analysis aided in studying the molecular
characteristics of the progression and regression of atherosclerosis.
5. The use of GAPDH as a housekeeper could potentially raise a flag. As with all
tissue types, work must be done to find a suitable reference gene. A brief
literature review of reference genes in ascending aortas of human patients
suggests GAPDH to be one of the least stable genes tested. They continue to
suggest a few genes that might be of interest to your further work (PMID:
23326585). If GAPDH is indeed stable for your work, it would useful to show
this in your paper. This factors into the below comment with regards to error bars
and n number.
Responses:
1) Again, the referee is absolutely correct here. The study that the referee
provided (PMID: 23326585) showed that PPIA was a better choice than GAPDH
as a housekeeping gene in ascending aortas of human patients. Considering the
differences between human and rabbit aortas, we designed primers of rabbit
PPIA (NM_001082057.1) and compared the results using PPIA as a
housekeeping gene with GAPDH as a housekeeping gene in our samples of
rabbit aortas. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the
ratio of the Ct value PPIA/GAPDH among the three groups (Control group:
1.07±0.06, Model group: 1.25 ± 0.28, Recovery group: 0.94 ± 0.22, all P value >
0.05).
Additionally, some previous reports of rabbit aorta have used GAPDH as a
housekeeping gene [7, 8]. A study of reference genes in the left ventricle of
rabbits suggested that GAPDH was one of the most stable genes tested [9]. Thus,
we think that using GAPDH as a housekeeping gene in the aorta was reliable in
our study.
2) We have added error bars and n=4 in the revised legend of Figure 6.
5. Figure 6. requires annotation of the microarray graphs. Also, error bars are
essential in the RT-PCR data, along with n number. If this is based on n=1 work,
replicates are also essential.
Responses:
1) We have annotated Figure 6A as a microarray graph, which is shown as a
signal value in our revised manuscript.
2) We have added error bars and n=4 to the RT-PCR data in the revised legend of
Figure 6.
6. I object to the phrase, "The results showed that our gene chip was reliable" as
this is only based on the validation of 4 genes. Consider using the phrase, "The
results suggest that our gene chip was reliable". This is a subtle change in
language; but given my own work on validation of big datasets, 4 genes is not
enough to validate an entire dataset.
Response:
The referee suggested that “the results suggest that our gene chip was reliable” is
more correct and appropriate, and therefore, we have re-written this phrase in
P10, Line 9.
We thank the referee for the excellent comments.
Referee: 2
1. The English and grammar is mostly okay throughout, but some small
copyediting is required to meet minimum standards.
Responses:
Thank you for your valuable feedback. We have had our revised manuscript
copy-edited by a native English speaker.
2. Title: I'm not sure the title is fit for purpose having read the study.
Responses:
We would propose either “Use of a rabbit atherosclerosis gene chip to discover
new biomarkers for human coronary artery disease” or
“Large-scale gene analysis of rabbit atherosclerosis to discover new biomarkers
for human coronary artery disease” as the title of our manuscript.
3. Introduction:
The introduction was concise, which is good, but would have benefitted from a
more careful description of the experiment in the final paragraph; for example,
what tissue do the authors use?
Responses:
According to the referee’s suggestion, we have re-written this part by more
carefully describing the experiment in the final paragraph, and we have
mentioned the abdominal aorta, which is the tissue we used in the experiment in
P3, Line 32-40.
4. Methods:
4-1. The model should be much better described so that it is explicit how the
animal’s groups were assigned and what the protocol was. The figure is
informative, but the words should be clear also.
Responses:
We have re-written this part to better describe the model in the method section in
our manuscript in P4, Line 3-22. I hope that the corrections are clearer for
readers.
4-2. The authors don't state whether the control was a sham or not, but I suspect
it is not. If this is indeed the case, I would like some justification for not using a
sham model as a control, as the gene changes may result from the surgery, and
recovery and not from the model. This is a major flaw in this study and needs to
be carefully addressed.
Responses:
The referee raises a very important question here as to whether it is better to use
a sham model as a control. One reason we did not choose to use a sham control
was to reduce the risk of death of rabbits by femoral artery cutdown. It is well
known that balloon injury causes intima hyperplasia, which is widely used in the
rabbit model of atherosclerosis. The gene changes between the model group and
a sham control group may highlight the genes associated with the arterial wall
that were injured by balloon from the diaphragm to the iliofemoral artery. Thus,
we suggest that femoral artery cutdown in a sham control would not influence
the gene changes in atherosclerosis.
In addition, the gene changes in regression were compared between the model
and recovery groups, and both of these groups underwent surgery.
4-3. Blood sampling - please state more detail regarding blood collection, how
much was collected and into what tube did you collect (EDTA?).
Responses:
We collected 5 mL blood samples from rabbits or humans into non-EDTA tubes
in P4, Line 39-40 and P7, Line 1-2.
4-4. Sample collection - This section needs a more detailed protocol. I'm not
clear from this which tissue you used for the RNA extraction? Did you use
fibrotic scars, normal looking tissue, a mix. The relative homogeneity of the
tissue is important, especially in light of the non-sham control.
Responses:
We collected the abdominal aortas at the location of balloon injury from the
diaphragm to the iliofemoral artery in the model and recovery groups. In the
control group, the abdominal aortas were collected from the same location from
the diaphragm to the iliofemoral artery.
4-5. Also, Stating 'Trizol method' does not do justice to the range of strategies
for RNA collection. Did you store the tissue in RNAlater? Did you purify
directly on a column, or precipitate. when you used the Aglient, what RIN cutoff
did you get/apply?
Responses:
1) We isolated the abdominal aorta and fixed it in RNA later immediately after
dissection.
2) We purified RNA on a column by using an RNeasy micro kit (Cat#74004,
QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany) and RNase-Free DNase Set (Cat#79254,
QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany).
3) When using the Agilent system, we applied a RIN cutoff of >7.
We have re-written this part in detail in the revised manuscript.
4-6. Microarray analysis - I can't see any reference to Multiple test correction in
this section. Also, it's not clear whether you applied the statistical analysis before
or after flag cutoff. Please write a detailed protocol.
Responses:
As the referee suggested, we have re-written the detailed protocol in the method
part of the microarray analysis in the revised manuscript in P5 Line 41-44 and P6
Line 1-8.
4-7. In addition, I can't see any reference to the public repository that you have
or will upload this data into. Please consider sharing your data with ncbi GEO.
Responses:
We are very sorry for our negligence in sharing the data with NCBI GEO, as we
do not have experience previously uploading such data.
This resubmission, we have shared our data with NCBI GEO and our GEO
accession number is GSE122669. The entries are scheduled to be released on
Mar 31, 2019 (If needed, we can change our released date in advance).
To review GEO accession GSE122669:
Please go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE122669
Enter token gpuzmiuqplydtmt into the box
4-8. Please give the full name for DAVID, and not just the abbreviation.
Responses:
We have re-written “DAVID (Databases for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery)” in the revised manuscript in P6 Line3-4.
4-9. qPCR - the authors do not state whether the samples processed for qPCR
were independent from those they performed the microarray on. If they are the
same samples, this is a technical validation and of little value.
Responses:
We have added error bars and n=4 for the qPCR samples in the revised legend of
Figure 6. The three samples processed for qPCR were independent from those
used for the microarray analysis.
4-10. Primers - The authors have used GAPDH as a calibrator in their PCR. Did
they test this to determine whether GAPDH is regulated in this tissue by the
treatment, if it does (and it often does), then this is a poor calibrator.
Responses:
We refer to the primer sequences of GAPDH in a previous report [10]. Some
studies of rabbit aortas [7, 8] have reporting using GAPDH as a housekeeping
gene. A study of reference genes in the left ventricle of rabbits suggested that
GAPDH is one of the most stable genes tested [9]. In addition, the difference in
CT values between the control, model and recovery groups was not significant.
Thus, we suggest that using GAPDH as a housekeeper in the aorta was reliable.
4-11. Human Serum - it is a big jump to suggest that gene expression in serum
will reflect gene expression in the aorta. This is a second major flaw in this paper
that needs careful thought.
Responses:
The referee raises a very important question here. Given that vascular tissue is
not readily accessible in humans, identifying protein markers in the serum can
have practical implications in developing diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of
CAD. However, there may not be a direct correlation between vascular gene
expression and serum protein levels for the same markers because of the lack of
vascular tissue. In our study, we used a rabbit model to validate the correlation
between vascular gene expression and serum protein levels for the same markers.
We found that gene expression in serum was consistent with the chip results.
Although we correlated rabbit vascular gene expression with serum protein
levels in humans, the results are meaningful due to the molecular similarities
between experimental rabbit atherosclerosis and human atherosclerosis. Thus, it
is possible that the rabbit atherosclerosis model could be used to study the
molecular pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. We believe that these findings
highlight a new method that could be used to discover novel biomarkers for
human CAD. We have added this text to the discussion section in the revised
manuscript P14 Line 27-39.
5. Results:
5-1. Figure 2 shows a graph where the neointimal area is significantly regulated
between model and recovery. My eye tells me that there are also changes
between control and model and control and recovery that are also significant.
Please ensure that you have applied the appropriate statistics here.
Responses:
In our study, the progression of atherosclerosis was compared between the model
group and the control group, and the regression of atherosclerosis was compared
between the recovery group and the model group. We used Student's t test for
comparisons and have re-written this part in the revised manuscript in P7 Line
18-22.
5-2. Figure 3 is too low a resolution for me to see differences. Please provide
high resolution images with better magnification.
Responses:
There may have been some limitations in the upload of the figures preventing
some of the high-resolution figures from being converted to PDF. We have
provided the high-resolution images in the resubmission.
5-3. DRG - please cite Treeview software.
Responses:
We have cited the TreeView software in the methods and the legend of figure 4.
5-4. Please provide the list of 3716 differentially regulated genes in a
supplementary table.
Responses:
We have provided these genes in Supplementary Table 1.
5-5. Please ensure that the key for the heatmap is better. At present it is difficult
to see.
Responses:
We have modified the key for the heatmap so that it can be more clearly seen.
5-6. Please ensure that the genes for each of the clusters is provided in a
supplementary file.
Responses:
We have provided these genes in Supplementary Table 1.
5-7. Please ensure that the genes for each of the enriched GO analysis is
provided.
Responses:
We have provided these genes in Supplementary Table 2.
5-8. Please give a better description of how you chose your 4 validation targets.
Responses:
We have rewritten this part regarding how the 4 validation targets were chosen in
the revised manuscript in P9 Line 43-44, P10 Line 1-6. “Under the guidance of
gene chip analysis, we screened candidate biomarkers from among the genes of
clusters 2 and 4 because these genes may have the ability to more quickly cause
regression of atherosclerosis. Thus, we selected lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and
bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) from the enriched genes of the
“glycolytic process” and “glucose homeostasis” in cluster 2 and macrophage
cationic peptide 2 (MCP2) and somatostatin (SST) from the enriched genes of
“regulation of immune system process” and “cell migration” in cluster 4, all of
which had significantly changed signal values in the formation or regression of
atherosclerosis. ”
6. Discussion:
The discussion is too short because only four genes were revealed following a
comprehensive gene expression study. This discussion should have a more
comprehensive discussion about the genes found. Also, there is no real
discussion about how the four genes might be biomarkers in human blood AND
in the aorta. Are there experimental reasons or are these biologically important?
This data has not been placed into the current understanding of atherosclerosis or
caloric restriction.
Responses:
1) According to the referee’s suggestion, we have re-written the discussion
section in the revised manuscript in P12 Line 40-44, P13 Line 1-9. We have
included a more comprehensive discussion about how the genes were identified.
2) BMP7 and SST have been shown to play important roles in obesity or
hypertension based on previous experimental results. However, we first found
that they were significantly changed in CAD patients in our study by analysis of
the progression and regression of atherosclerosis in the rabbit model. Then, we
confirmed their biologically important roles as biomarkers in CAD.
3) Considering the Referee’s suggestion, “This data has not been placed into the
current understanding of atherosclerosis or caloric restriction”, we have
re-written this section in our revised manuscript in P13 Line 12-25. We hope that
the description in the manuscript strengthens the correlation.
We hope that the referees and editor will agree that the revised manuscript is
much improved compared with the original submitted version. We have marked
the changes in the revised paper in red. We appreciate the Editors/Referees’ hard
work and constructive feedback, and we hope that these corrections will meet
your approval. We are happy to continue the revision process if the referees feel
further changes are needed. Once again, thank you very much for your
comments and suggestions.

Appendix B
Dear Dr. Glover,
We are especially grateful that our manuscript (RSOB-18-0238)
entitled "Large-scale gene analysis using a rabbit atherosclerosis
model to discover new biomarkers for human coronary artery disease"
has been accepted for publication in Open Biology. We greatly
appreciate the constructive comments and suggestions from you and
referees on our manuscript. Based on the referees’ comments, we have
made revisions marked in red in the manuscript. Below, Please find
our replies, comments, and inclusions to the revised manuscript in
sequence below.
Referee: 2
2. No – I think that the suggestions for the title are both to close to the
original. The problem with this is that the jump between the animal
model and the human is too great. I think it is interesting that this this
comparison was performed, but I still think that it is misleading to
include human in the title.
Responses: Referee’s point is well taken, we are willing to leave out
the word “human” from the title. The new title would be “Large-scale
gene analysis of rabbit atherosclerosis to discover new biomarkers for
coronary artery disease”
4.2 I think that the authors should ensure that this explanation is
included in the manuscript. I can’t see reference to a Sham group.
Responses: As referee suggested, we had added this explanation and
cited reference in the discussion section.
4.6 Did you run a Multiple test correction?
Responses: We recognize that three biological replicates are optimal
for the experiment, considering the cost of 9 samples, we selected one
representative sample from each group for the microarray analysis.
However, the candidate genes were validated by RT-PCR in four
samples from each group and have a multiple test correction. The
RT-PCR results showed that the gene chip analysis aided in studying
the molecular characteristics of the progression and regression of
atherosclerosis.
4.10 Did you run a significance test on this primer. Indeed, did you
show that all the primers hit an amplification efficiency between
90%-110%?
Responses: We have run a significance test on these primers and the
amplificantion efficiency of these primers were listed as follows:
GAPDH: 99.17%, BMP7: 97.8%, LPL: 95.02%, MCP2: 96.05%, SST:
96.05%.
We thank the referee for the excellent comments.

Comments to the Author(s)
Methods
2.1 I think there is a need to be more specific whether the
measurements obtained were from the same animals, rather than a
4-week cohort and 8-week cohort (with calorie restriction) being
plotted. As no n number is listed in the figure legend, this is not
obvious. Presumably you took bloods from the 4 animals that were fed
the high-calorie diet, and used the same animals once you switched to
the calorie restriction diet (AS60 Cohort) rather than pooling blood
samples from those killed at the 4-week mark in addition to the others
(AS30 + AS60).
Responses: As referee suggested, we have added the n number in the
figure legend in our revised manuscript.We pooled blood samples from
those killed at the 4-week mark in addition to the others (AS30 +
AS60). In the other words, there were 8 rabbits in AS0 and AS30, and
there were 4 rabbits in AS60.
Besides, we also got the same results by the performace with the 4
rabbits (that were fed the high-calorie diet, and used the same animals
once we switched to the calorie restriction diet (AS60 Cohort)).
We pooled blood samples from those killed at the 4-week because we
wanted to express our model group better. If not, we can provided the
measurement obtained from the same rabbits.
2.3 Please indicate the anticoagulant used, rather than “non-EDTA”
tubes.
Responses: Thank you very much for your suggestion, considering that
we colleted the serum, we used the “non-EDTA” tubes which refer to
pro-coagulation tubes. We have correted it in our revised manuscript.
2.4 RNALater “Stabilises”, it does not act as a fixing agent.
Responses: It was true as referee suggested, RNA later does not as a
fixing agent. In our revised manuscript, some vascular tissue were
stored in RNA later for mRNA extraction, and some vascular tissue
were stored in formalin for fixing.
2.8 Again, please indicate the anticoagulant used for the human blood
samples.
Responses: Thank you very much for your suggestion, we used the
“non-EDTA” tubes which refer to pro-coagulation tubes. We have
correted it in our revised manuscript.
Results
All figure s. List n numbers on all graphs as this is essential to their
interpretation.
Responses: As referee suggested, we have listed n numbers on all
graphs.
3.2 For the comparison of intima thickness, an ANOVA is
recommended, rather than multiple t-tests between Model and either
Control or Recovery groups.
Responses: We have performed the ANOVA analysis for the
comparison of intima thickness in Figure 2 and 3.
We appreciate the Editors/Referees’ hard work and constructive
feedback, and we hope that these revisions will meet your approval.
We are happy to continue the revision process if the referees feel
further changes are needed. Once again, thank you very much for your
comments and suggestions.
