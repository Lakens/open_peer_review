Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
This is a timely, interesting and rather comprehensive review on the use of human iPSCs in
modeling neurodegenerative diseases. 3 main neurodegenerative diseases were discussed, i.e.
AD, PD and HD. Overall, the write up is informative and the tables provided that summarize the
various iPSC-linked disease models generated thus far by different groups serve as a good
resource.
Notwithstanding the above, I have some comments/suggestions that might help to improve the
article further, as discussed below:
1. Although current animal models of neurodegenerative diseases are well recognized for their
limitations, they have nonetheless shed important insights into the pathogenesis of various
neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, they provide the associated behavioral phenotype
(e.g. cognitive or motor impairments) that could be quantified, which also serve as useful
readouts for drug evaluation. This is something that 2D and even 3D iPSC-based disease models
cannot recapitulate. The authors may wish to take this into consideration in their discussion.
2. The maturity of iPSC-derived neurons and the time for them to age sufficiently to manifest the
disease-associated phenotypes is indeed an issue (p. 4). The authors stated that the issue is
addressed by “the use of multiple well-characterized iPSC lines and isogenic controls”. Arguably,
these lines may resolve the variability issue but not the time issue.
3. Related to the above, for age-related neurodegenerative diseases like AD and PD, substantial
length of time is needed for the phenotype to manifest. Hence, the use of progerin-induced aging
as a strategy to accelerate the aging process, which the authors have also highlighted. However,
is progerin-induced aging an appropriate model for AD and PD? This is something that merits
discussion.
4. The section “Modeling neurodegenerative diseases with by 3D brain model” is grammatically
incorrect (i.e. with or by?). Importantly, the reported generation and characterization of 3D
ventral midbrain organoid model that is relevant to PD (e.g. Jo et al., 2017 Cell Stem Cell) was not
discussed.
5. The authors have discussed several limitations surrounding current 3D organoid models. One
major limitation with the ventral midbrain model is its primitive structure, which in no way
3
recapitulate the nigrostriatal pathway that degenerates in human PD brain. The authors might
want to include this point in their revised discussion.
6. Some missing references: “…Mao-B inhibitors or overexpression…for PD treatment” (p. 10);
“neuronal function was characterized…oligodendrocytes (29.6%)” (p. 17)
7. Parkin R275W is incorrectly stated as PINK1 R275W (p. 9)
8. The manuscript is peppered with typographic errors. For example, “PRAK7” instead of “PARK
7” (p. 8); “glucocerebrocidas” instead of “glucocerebrocidase” (p. 10)

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a timely, interesting and rather comprehensive review on the use of human iPSCs in modeling
neurodegenerative diseases. 3 main neurodegenerative diseases were discussed, i.e. AD, PD and HD.
Overall, the write up is informative and the tables provided that summarize the various iPSC-linked disease
models generated thus far by different groups serve as a good resource.
Notwithstanding the above, I have some comments/suggestions that might help to improve the article
further, as discussed below:
1. Although current animal models of neurodegenerative diseases are well recognized for their limitations,
they have nonetheless shed important insights into the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders.
Importantly, they provide the associated behavioral phenotype (e.g. cognitive or motor impairments) that
could be quantified, which also serve as useful readouts for drug evaluation. This is something that 2D and
even 3D iPSC-based disease models cannot recapitulate. The authors may wish to take this into
consideration in their discussion.
Response:
We thank reviewers for this and other thoughtful suggestions; we believe that addressing each one has greatly Formatted: Font color: Text 1
improved the quality of our manuscript. We agree that animal models provide important insights into the
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and it is inarguable that in vitro iPSC-based models cannot Formatted: Font: Italic, Font color: Text 1
Formatted: Font color: Text 1
recapitulate the behavioral phenotypes, such as motor dysfunction in PD and impaired cognition in AD. Thus,
we have revised the Conclusion accordingly, and we now suggest the use of iPSC-based models in
combination with animal models for drug development. In this way, novel interventions can be evaluated in
these complementary systems prior to clinical application (Page 18, Line 579). Formatted: Font color: Text 1
2. The maturity of iPSC-derived neurons and the time for them to age sufficiently to manifest the disease-
associated phenotypes is indeed an issue (p. 4). The authors stated that the issue is addressed by “the use of
multiple well-characterized iPSC lines and isogenic controls”. Arguably, these lines may resolve the
variability issue but not the time issue.
Response:
We revised the Introduction accordingly, mentioning that some issues of timing could be potentially
addressed by multiple treatments or long-term 3D organoid cultures. For most diseases of aging, multiple
treatments are required to promote the expression of disease-associated phenotypes in cellular models. This
approach may also be improved by utilizing long-term 3D organoid cultures. These complex structures
uniquely provide a human organ-like tissue that is amenable to long-term culturing for disease modeling
(Page 3, Line 90). Formatted: Font color: Text 1

3. Related to the above, for age-related neurodegenerative diseases like AD and PD, substantial length of
time is needed for the phenotype to manifest. Hence, the use of progerin-induced aging as a strategy to
accelerate the aging process, which the authors have also highlighted. However, is progerin-induced aging
an appropriate model for AD and PD? This is something that merits discussion.
Response:
Progerin overexpression causes telomere shortening, which is a typical feature of aging. Thus, we revised Formatted: Font color: Text 1, Not Highlight
the Conclusion and now discuss the potential approach of inducing premature aging with progerin in Formatted: Font color: Text 1
combination with iPSCs derived from other diseases, including HD and AD. However, the cellular Formatted: Font color: Text 1, Not Highlight
