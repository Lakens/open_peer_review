The manuscript by Leonard et al presents analyses based on the sequencing of the genome of a
stramenopile pseudofungus, but really does a wonderful job integrating ecological and
evolutionary genomics of the entire ecological/phylogenetic group. Few stones were left
unturned. Some of the novel results include detailing the diversity of fungal-like nutritional
strategies represented in the genomes of pseudofungi, the likely insertion of a viral genome into
H. catenoides, ancestral state of chitin metabolism machinery, and evidence of losses of
taxonomically relevant characters such as plastids and regular flagellum, and convergence in
polar growth. The strong message here is that the fungal lifestyle is mostly convergent in the true
fungi and pseudofungi.
Most of the analyses and experiments were expertly performed. I would like to be able to say
accept as is, however I think the species tree (Fig. 1B) generated to reconstruct evolutionary
events in the lineage was not adequately described. While I don’t doubt the majority of nodes
supported in this tree, the near 100% nodes with 100% bootstraps to my mind represents inflated
certainty. What proportion of trees support each node (Tree Certainty)? This should be easily
accomplished by running orthologous gene sets through the authors’ automated ML phylogeny
pipeline, and then computing the proportion of trees supporting each node using the methods
incorporated in the newest versions of RAxML.
I was unable to find the main figure legends in the main text? I would be happy to review these
when they are located (or I am shown where I missed them). Most of the figures were self-
explanatory, but I may have missed something the authors were trying to point out.
The sentence beginning line 147 would be easier to digest if rearranged.
Can the beta-glucan+transporter fusion be an operon or annotation artifact? What is the
expectation that these specific kinds of functional fusions occur?

TITLE: The evolution of parasitic oomycete and fungal-like traits through genome analysis of the
free-living pseudofungus Hyphochytrium catenoides
In this article, Lenonard et al. presents an interesting genomic portrait of the saprophytic
hyphochytriomycete ‘pseudofungus’ Hyphochytrium catenoides. The authors used this genomic
information to investigate the evolution of Pseudofungi. They have performed a series of
analyses entailing genome comparisons with other microbial eukaryotes, drug sensitivity
analysis and high-throughput culture arrays to investigate the ancestry of
oomycete/pseudofungal idiosynchrasies and metabolic features. They convincingly show that
several of these pseudofungal genetic traits are specific to the Oomycete lineage. Comparative
genomics of saprophytic and pathogenic Fungi and Oomycetes also revealed clear differences in
the repertoire of genes associated with filamentous growth between the Fungi and the
Pseudofungi. These include differences in the repertoire of genes encoding components of the
vesicle trafficking systems, cell wall synthesis pathways and motor proteins. These substantial
differences in gene content suggest convergent evolution of filamentous osmotrophic growth
within Fungi and Pseudofungi.
Overall, the data presented in the paper is technically sound and these results should appeal to a
broad readership including scientists with an interest in microbiology, plant pathology, and
evolution of fungal/oomycete lifestyles. The experiments performed and methods used seem to
be appropriate (but see below).
In this paper, the Authors face a challenging task: to summarize the body of information gained
from the comparative analysis of the Hyphochytrium genome and gene repertoires of several
other filamentous microbes, as well as discussing new transcriptomic/biological datasets in a few
pages. Most of the conclusions are well supported by the current set of experimental datasets
and results, but as it stands, the manuscript is wordy and lengthy. Having a Results &
Discussion section does not help. It is hard to grasp the main conclusions on the evolutionary
4
biology of their system. As a result, the current manuscript fell short of achieving its full
potential. I encourage the Authors to produce a more concise manuscript focusing on the main
conclusions and moving several of the more ‘routine’ genomic analyses to the Supplemental
Material section. I suggest an extensive revision of the manuscript to improve its clarity and the
narrative flow.
A few suggestions:
– the Abstract is emphasizing one of the main conclusions of the present study, the viral
co-evolution. Although interesting, this results in an unbalanced summary of the main
conclusions.
- although the CEGMA/BUSCO analyses aimed to assess the completeness of the gene
repertoire are crucial for the remaining part of the study, they can be summarized in one or two
sentences and the details moved to SM section;
- similarly, I would move the section on domain architecture distribution (L 238-250) to
the SM section ;
– two pages are dealing with the footprint of a plastid gene ancestry in the H. catenoides
genome assembly (L 369-413), but the conclusions are very vague and “inconclusive“. Delete.
– Move the section describing the viral integration across the Pseudofungi and the
organelle genomes after the discussion of the protein repertoire.
Additional comments:
– Insert a figure in the Introduction presenting Hyphochytrium catenoides and its main
morphological features;
– The conclusions on the evolution of secreted CAZymes should be supported by CAFE
(expansion/contraction of gene families) and NOTUNG gene tree/species tree reconciliation
analyses focusing on gene families encoding enzymes thought to be involved in plant cell wall
(PCW) degradation. This also apply to other key protein studied in this work.
– Table 1 should only list the secreted plant cell wall degrading and secreted protease
genes – i.e. those having a role in saprotrophy;
– Figure 1 is cluttered;
– Legends of the main figures are missing from the merged pdf;
– Figure 2: Auxiliary activities are not defined.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_5
Regarding the phylogenomic tree figure/analysis:
****Reviewer 1 also asks us to identify orthologues and investigate individual tree support for the
nodes reported. Unfortunately, we do not agree with this logic for two main reasons 1) the
identification of orthologues is extremely noisy and recovers numerous false positives
R2: Perhaps my suggestion was not clear. I have not asked the authors to identify orthologs. In
order to generate a concatenated alignment, orthologs must have already been predicted, as the
authors state: “We generated a concatenated amino acid alignment of 245 putative orthologues
(85 taxa and 71,862 amino acid sites) and including a comprehensive sampling of eukaryotic taxa
based on previously published papers [23].” Tree certainty is a quick step from there, taking 3
seconds from the 245 best trees (only a problem if this work is being done on a single desktop
computer, and authors do not know how to automate the process). With only 85 taxa per tree,
these should complete rather quickly.
**** and 2) the resulting orthologous gene phylogenies would be, by their nature, subject to a
higher noise-to-signal ratio, leading to many false phylogenetic results.
R2: The reasoning for the suggested analysis is to identify bias in the alignment coming from a
small subset of genes with a strong conflicting signal, as well as systematic bias in the dataset.
These effects were clearly demonstrated by Salichos and Rokas:
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7449/full/nature12130.html
As they demonstrate, large alignments usually give 100% bootstrap support for nodes even in the
presence of significant conflict. This has been known for some time:
https://doi.org/10.1080/10635150601146041
The problem of noisy genes can easily be solved by removing the ortholog groups with low
average internode certainty. I am not suggesting this be done, only that authors present the tree
certainty (proportion of the partitions supporting the hypothesis that results from concatenation)
in the dataset. This is a matter of due diligence to address known problems with concatenation,
which is far simpler than employing alternative methods of combining data. It would be a shame
to include an antiquated phylogenomic analysis in an otherwise excellent manuscript, although
the authors are free to do so. Or why do the phylogenomic analysis at all?
****As part of our analysis we did identify orthologue families to investigate pseudofungal
specific orthologues (Table S3). To give some indication of the noisy nature of this analysis an
orthologue finding pipeline found over 80 candidate pseudofungal specific orthologues.
R2: I am confused, is the 245 ortholog concatenated matrix patchily populated? There is no
mention of missing data in the methods. Most phylogenomic analyses of species relationships
start with orthologs that are 1 per species.
****Further, manual analysis (which is not possible on the scale the reviewer is suggesting for
every gene family) demonstrated only 9 of these were correctly identified as pseudofungal
specific orthologues using this pipeline approach. This demonstrates the messy nature of these
types of analyses. This is why we did not go into this data further in the paper (reviewer 2 also
asked us to further reduce this section). The combination of messy orthologue recovery and the
fact that individual gene phylogenies suffer from a high noise-to-signal ratio is the reason we
chose to focus on a comprehensive multi-gene phylogenetic analysis using a very large
concatenated protein alignment.
9
R2: I am certainly not suggesting manual analysis. One simply breaks the alignment into the
partitions, computes a tree for each partition, and calculates internode agreement among the
resulting trees. Were the orthologs put into the matrix added manually? Presumably, the
individual alignments already exist, because aligning the concatenated alignment would certainly
not work correctly, especially with missing sequences. The methods are not detailed in this
regard.
Conclusion to all discussion on this figure/analysis: I can go along with the tree being drawn this
way for illustration purposes (not providing weight to one hypothesis or another in stramenopile
diversification), and therefore does not warrant a more thorough examination of the matrix,
which would require significant additional compute time. I do think this makes bootstrap values
superfluous. The initial suggestion would be more than reasonable if the aim were to infer the
phylogeny of this group.
Other replies:
R2: The figure legends in the generated PDF are sometimes the supplementary legends and
sometimes the main text legends when I download (this is not the authors’ fault apparently).
****As discussed in the paper this gene fusion is present in a number of oomycetes, e.g. P.
infestans XP_002998554 and is present in the Hypho transcriptome on one contig "contig09799" so
is unlikely to be an annotation artefact. It is encoded on a putative nuclear contig so it is unlikely
to be an operon.
R2: I find this rather unsatisfying given the recent evidence of operons in fungi. I think either a
brief mention that an operon cannot be excluded because proteomics were not performed, or a
statement of sequence observations that make an operon unlikely would suffice.
R2: Second (B) should be (C) in Figure 1 legend.

label_comment_6
Leonard et al presents the genome sequence of the pseudofungus Hyphochytrium catenoides
with detailed analyses of its coding potential. I found the paper to be well-written and
interesting, I only have a few minor points to add. Most important of these is my suggestion to
run a partitioned RAxML ML analysis as a surrogate to the questionable IQ-Tree analysis (see
below). A further analysis that the authors might find useful is to calculate the enrichment of
pfam domains in H. catenoides vs. other stramenopiles or that of pseudofungi vs. other
eukaryotes using a hypergeometric test. This would detect all expanded pfams in the study
group and would assign p-values to expansions, while correcting for differences in proteome
sizes.
Minor comments:
line-78: maybe add some details here on how the genome was sequenced?
line-81: I’m not sure how often the alignment parcentage of transcriptome data is used as a
measure of genome completeness? Since both can be incomplete to an unknown extent, the 97%
alignability might be misleading. Also, how do the authors explain the BUSCO value of 52%?
This seems too low compared to the CEGMA figures.
line-138-139: please note that the recommendation of the author’s of IQ-Tree is to run 10-100000
ultrafast bootstrap replicates. Since the UF bootstrap uses a less efficient branch swapping
algorithm, it tends to overestimate BS percentages. I would prefer to see how these figures
compare to 100 conventional bootstrap reps in RAxML.
line-139: please include actual numbers of bs% in Fig S6 instead of dots.
line-141: as a discretionary comment, I expect a raxml analysis with 100 bootstrap replicates to be
feasible computationally if a computing cluster is available to the authors. Would be an
interesting comparison, even if ran on a subset of the 85 taxa.
line-171: please cross check gene ids with this statement and Fig S7. I could not find
‘Hypho2016_00003038 ’ on the fig.
line-192: maybe you mean secreted proteases?
line-213: gene tree: species tree reconciliation could provide an explicit answer to that question.
line-215: 218: this sentence is hard to follow, could you rephrase?
line-221: including pfam ID-s in Table S3 would be useful.
line-336: what is paralogue family expansion? please rephrase
line-395 and elsewhere: I’m wondering if ‘under sampled’ is better written as undersampled?
line-613: please include more detail on how the concatenated alignment was made. How were
single-gene alignments made and overly variable sites treated? Also, was the concatenated
dataset partitioned by gene? As there is a chance for LBA to be in action, these are important
parameters.
line-712: what does ‘…’ stand for?
line-716: ‘All number…’ this is sort of useless without specifying those genome portals. Maybe
you could cite more specific sources or publications where these metrics are reported?

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7449/full/nature12130.html
As they demonstrate, large alignments usually give 100% bootstrap support for nodes even in the
presence of significant conflict. This has been known for some time:
https://doi.org/10.1080/10635150601146041
The problem of noisy genes can easily be solved by removing the ortholog groups with low
average internode certainty. I am not suggesting this be done, only that authors present the tree
certainty (proportion of the partitions supporting the hypothesis that results from concatenation)
in the dataset. This is a matter of due diligence to address known problems with concatenation,
which is far simpler than employing alternative methods of combining data. It would be a shame
to include an antiquated phylogenomic analysis in an otherwise excellent manuscript, although
the authors are free to do so. Or why do the phylogenomic analysis at all?
****As part of our analysis we did identify orthologue families to investigate pseudofungal
specific orthologues (Table S3). To give some indication of the noisy nature of this analysis an
orthologue finding pipeline found over 80 candidate pseudofungal specific orthologues.
R2: I am confused, is the 245 ortholog concatenated matrix patchily populated? There is no
mention of missing data in the methods. Most phylogenomic analyses of species relationships
start with orthologs that are 1 per species.
****Further, manual analysis (which is not possible on the scale the reviewer is suggesting for
every gene family) demonstrated only 9 of these were correctly identified as pseudofungal
specific orthologues using this pipeline approach. This demonstrates the messy nature of these
types of analyses. This is why we did not go into this data further in the paper (reviewer 2 also
asked us to further reduce this section). The combination of messy orthologue recovery and the
fact that individual gene phylogenies suffer from a high noise-to-signal ratio is the reason we
chose to focus on a comprehensive multi-gene phylogenetic analysis using a very large
concatenated protein alignment.
R2: I am certainly not suggesting manual analysis. One simply breaks the alignment into the
partitions, computes a tree for each partition, and calculates internode agreement among the
resulting trees. Were the orthologs put into the matrix added manually? Presumably, the
individual alignments already exist, because aligning the concatenated alignment would certainly
not work correctly, especially with missing sequences. The methods are not detailed in this
regard.
Conclusion to all discussion on this figure/analysis: I can go along with the tree being drawn this
way for illustration purposes (not providing weight to one hypothesis or another in stramenopile
diversification), and therefore does not warrant a more thorough examination of the matrix,
which would require significant additional compute time. I do think this makes bootstrap values
superfluous. The initial suggestion would be more than reasonable if the aim were to infer the
phylogeny of this group.
Other replies:
R2: The figure legends in the generated PDF are sometimes the supplementary legends and
sometimes the main text legends when I download (this is not the authors’ fault apparently).
****As discussed in the paper this gene fusion is present in a number of oomycetes, e.g. P.
infestans XP_002998554 and is present in the Hypho transcriptome on one contig "contig09799" so
is unlikely to be an annotation artefact. It is encoded on a putative nuclear contig so it is unlikely
to be an operon.
14
R2: I find this rather unsatisfying given the recent evidence of operons in fungi. I think either a
brief mention that an operon cannot be excluded because proteomics were not performed, or a
statement of sequence observations that make an operon unlikely would suffice.
R2: Second (B) should be (C) in Figure 1 legend.

Leonard et al presents the genome sequence of the pseudofungus Hyphochytrium catenoides
with detailed analyses of its coding potential. I found the paper to be well-written and
interesting, I only have a few minor points to add. Most important of these is my suggestion to
run a partitioned RAxML ML analysis as a surrogate to the questionable IQ-Tree analysis (see
below). A further analysis that the authors might find useful is to calculate the enrichment of
pfam domains in H. catenoides vs. other stramenopiles or that of pseudofungi vs. other
eukaryotes using a hypergeometric test. This would detect all expanded pfams in the study
group and would assign p-values to expansions, while correcting for differences in proteome
sizes.
Minor comments:
line-78: maybe add some details here on how the genome was sequenced?
line-81: I’m not sure how often the alignment parcentage of transcriptome data is used as a
measure of genome completeness? Since both can be incomplete to an unknown extent, the 97%
alignability might be misleading. Also, how do the authors explain the BUSCO value of 52%?
This seems too low compared to the CEGMA figures.
line-138-139: please note that the recommendation of the author’s of IQ-Tree is to run 10-100000
ultrafast bootstrap replicates. Since the UF bootstrap uses a less efficient branch swapping
algorithm, it tends to overestimate BS percentages. I would prefer to see how these figures
compare to 100 conventional bootstrap reps in RAxML.
line-139: please include actual numbers of bs% in Fig S6 instead of dots.
line-141: as a discretionary comment, I expect a raxml analysis with 100 bootstrap replicates to be
feasible computationally if a computing cluster is available to the authors. Would be an
interesting comparison, even if ran on a subset of the 85 taxa.
line-171: please cross check gene ids with this statement and Fig S7. I could not find
‘Hypho2016_00003038 ’ on the fig.
line-192: maybe you mean secreted proteases?
line-213: gene tree: species tree reconciliation could provide an explicit answer to that question.
line-215: 218: this sentence is hard to follow, could you rephrase?
line-221: including pfam ID-s in Table S3 would be useful.
line-336: what is paralogue family expansion? please rephrase
line-395 and elsewhere: I’m wondering if ‘under sampled’ is better written as undersampled?
line-613: please include more detail on how the concatenated alignment was made. How were
single-gene alignments made and overly variable sites treated? Also, was the concatenated
dataset partitioned by gene? As there is a chance for LBA to be in action, these are important
parameters.
line-712: what does ‘…’ stand for?
line-716: ‘All number…’ this is sort of useless without specifying those genome portals. Maybe
you could cite more specific sources or publications where these metrics are reported?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_9
The manuscript by Leonard et al presents analyses based on the sequencing of the genome of a
stramenopile pseudofungus, but really does a wonderful job integrating ecological and evolutionary
genomics of the entire ecological/phylogenetic group. Few stones were left unturned. Some of the
novel results include detailing the diversity of fungal-like nutritional strategies represented in the
genomes of pseudofungi, the likely insertion of a viral genome into H. catenoides, ancestral state of
chitin metabolism machinery, and evidence of losses of taxonomically relevant characters such as
plastids and regular flagellum, and convergence in polar growth. The strong message here is that the
fungal lifestyle is mostly convergent in the true fungi and pseudofungi.
Most of the analyses and experiments were expertly performed.
We thank the reviewer for the very positive review of our paper and for recognising our hard work to
try and bring an integrated evolutionary analysis to a genome paper.
I would like to be able to say accept as is, however I think the species tree (Fig. 1B) generated to
reconstruct evolutionary events in the lineage was not adequately described. While I don’t doubt the
majority of nodes supported in this tree, the near 100% nodes with 100% bootstraps to my mind
represents inflated certainty. What proportion of trees support each node (Tree Certainty)? This
should be easily accomplished by running orthologous gene sets through the authors’ automated ML
phylogeny pipeline, and then computing the proportion of trees supporting each node using the
methods incorporated in the newest versions of RAxML.
We have rewritten this section to provide additional back ground information and citations relating
to the calculation of this phylogeny. We have also included the wider phylogeny as a supplementary
figure which demonstrates multiple nodes in more contentious parts of the eukaryotic phylogeny that
are not supported with 100%. We have also included in the text a brief acknowledgment/caveat
relating to the fact that ultrafast bootstrap replicates can produce inflated support levels, but also
state why this approach was used as ‘traditional’ bootstrap approaches are not viable on a dataset of
this size.
The aim of our phylogenetic analysis was to use concatenated approaches to generate a very large
multiple sequence alignment. The logic for this approach is that large alignments minimise the level
of noisy signal while maximising the ‘true’ signal (theoretically the longer the alignment the more the
signal exceeds noise). This logic has been demonstrated to be true in numerous analyses (e.g. [1]). Our
alignment included 85 taxa and 71,862 alignment positions. This is a very large multiple alignment
position. The purpose of the phylogeny is to confirm the branching position of Hyphochytrium. The
results do not show any controversial phylogenetic position for this relationship and recovers
numerous strongly supported nodes. The results of this analysis are discussed in comparison to other
recent and very well executed analyses [2] using a similar approach but with different taxon sampling.
These analyses broadly agree and do not demonstrate anything to suggest the placement of
Hyphochytrium is controversial [acknowledged by the reviewer], which was the key purpose for this
analysis.
The reviewer is sceptical about the node the support values, even though the reviewer accepts the
topology presented. We note that Fig. 1 only shows a subsection of the phylogeny. In the previous
submission, we had included the full tree as a tree file in the supplementary data. We have now
included this figure as a full tree figure as well as the tree file (researchers like to use tree files for
downstream analysis, which we of course support). We note that the wider phylogeny used to
compute this topology demonstrates many nodes that are not 100% supported and as also mentioned
above we discuss the use of ultra-fast bootstrap method.
Reviewer 1 also asks us to identify orthologues and investigate individual tree support for the nodes
reported. Unfortunately, we do not agree with this logic for two main reasons 1) the identification of
orthologues is extremely noisy and recovers numerous false positives and 2) the resulting orthologous
gene phylogenies would be, by their nature, subject to a higher noise-to-signal ratio, leading to many
false phylogenetic results. As part of our analysis we did identify orthologue families to investigate
pseudofungal specific orthologues (Table S3). To give some indication of the noisy nature of this
analysis an orthologue finding pipeline found over 80 candidate pseudofungal specific orthologues.
Further, manual analysis (which is not possible on the scale the reviewer is suggesting for every gene
family) demonstrated only 9 of these were correctly identified as pseudofungal specific orthologues
using this pipeline approach. This demonstrates the messy nature of these types of analyses. This is
why we did not go into this data further in the paper (reviewer 2 also asked us to further reduce this
section). The combination of messy orthologue recovery and the fact that individual gene phylogenies
suffer from a high noise-to-signal ratio is the reason we chose to focus on a comprehensive multi-gene
phylogenetic analysis using a very large concatenated protein alignment.
I was unable to find the main figure legends in the main text? I would be happy to review these when
they are located (or I am shown where I missed them). Most of the figures were self-explanatory, but
I may have missed something the authors were trying to point out.
Included in revised manuscript. We did upload this but I think it was lost because of page formatting.
Please accept our apologies.
The sentence beginning line 147 would be easier to digest if rearranged.
We had trouble tracking down this sentence. We think we have rewritten it as requested: “Using
reciprocal BLAST searches we confirmed that H. catenoides encodes and expresses putative
homologues of all seven eukaryotic wide meiosis-specific gene families [3] in the culture conditions
used to grow H. catenoides prior to sequencing (see Table S1).”
Can the beta-glucan+transporter fusion be an operon or annotation artifact?
As discussed in the paper this gene fusion is present in a number of oomycetes, e.g. P. infestans
XP_002998554 and is present in the Hypho transcriptome on one contig "contig09799" so is unlikely
to be an annotation artefact. It is encoded on a putative nuclear contig so it is unlikely to be an operon.
What is the expectation that these specific kinds of functional fusions occur?
This is a difficult question to answer. Any specific answer would of course underestimate variations
that occur between phylogenetic groups and/or would require a very large research project to make
certain predictions. Our research team has worked extensively on this question and we know, for
example, that in fungi fusions do occur at a lower relative rate than fissions, making them unstable
characters [4]. We also know that fusions can occur between genes/proteins that encode linked
functions resulting in novel or improved functions (e.g. [5]). Given our lack of certainty of fusion/fission
metrics in the Pseudofungi we would prefer not to comment further. Although we note this section
has been rewritten on the suggestion of reviewer 2.

TITLE: The evolution of parasitic oomycete and fungal-like traits through genome analysis of the free-
living pseudofungus Hyphochytrium catenoides
In this article, Lenonard et al. presents an interesting genomic portrait of the saprophytic
hyphochytriomycete ‘pseudofungus’ Hyphochytrium catenoides. The authors used this genomic
information to investigate the evolution of Pseudofungi. They have performed a series of analyses
entailing genome comparisons with other microbial eukaryotes, drug sensitivity analysis and high-
throughput culture arrays to investigate the ancestry of oomycete/pseudofungal idiosynchrasies and
metabolic features. They convincingly show that several of these pseudofungal genetic traits are
specific to the Oomycete lineage. Comparative genomics of saprophytic and pathogenic Fungi and
Oomycetes also revealed clear differences in the repertoire of genes associated with filamentous
growth between the Fungi and the Pseudofungi. These include differences in the repertoire of genes
encoding components of the vesicle trafficking systems, cell wall synthesis pathways and motor
proteins. These substantial differences in gene content suggest convergent evolution of filamentous
osmotrophic growth within Fungi and Pseudofungi.
Overall, the data presented in the paper is technically sound and these results should appeal to a
broad readership including scientists with an interest in microbiology, plant pathology, and evolution
of fungal/oomycete lifestyles. The experiments performed and methods used seem to be appropriate
(but see below).
In this paper, the Authors face a challenging task: to summarize the body of information gained from
the comparative analysis of the Hyphochytrium genome and gene repertoires of several other
filamentous microbes, as well as discussing new transcriptomic/biological datasets in a few
pages. Most of the conclusions are well supported by the current set of experimental datasets and
results, but as it stands, the manuscript is wordy and lengthy.
We thank the reviewer for the positive over-view of our paper. As detailed below we have tried to
respond to the reviewers’ suggestions by making edits accordingly.
Having a Results & Discussion section does not help. It is hard to grasp the main conclusions on the
evolutionary biology of their system. As a result, the current manuscript fell short of achieving its full
potential. I encourage the Authors to produce a more concise manuscript focusing on the main
conclusions and moving several of the more ‘routine’ genomic analyses to the Supplemental Material
section. I suggest an extensive revision of the manuscript to improve its clarity and the narrative flow.
We have tried to revise the manuscript as suggested through-out. However, we must say that because
this is a genome analysis it is difficult to separate the results and discussion. Following the reviewers’
advice, we have edited the manuscript down, moved several sections to the supplementary material
and rewritten several sections.
A few suggestions:
– the Abstract is emphasizing one of the main conclusions of the present study, the viral co-
evolution. Although interesting, this results in an unbalanced summary of the main conclusions.
This has been done, thank you for the suggestion. We have reduced the summary of the virus data to
one sentence and emphasised the comparative genomic analysis of the oomycete and
fungal/pseudofungal traits.
- although the CEGMA/BUSCO analyses aimed to assess the completeness of the gene repertoire
are crucial for the remaining part of the study, they can be summarized in one or two sentences and
the details moved to SM section;
This has been done, thank you for the suggestion.
- similarly, I would move the section on domain architecture distribution (L 238-250) to the SM
section;
We are not sure what section the reviewer is specifically referring to here as the line numbers do not
seem to match up with the section mentioned. One of the main reasons for sequencing the
Hyphochytrium genome was to look into the pattern of conservation of characters in the Pseudofungi,
including shared gene-fusion-architectures, so we are keen to retain this analysis. However, consistent
with the reviewers aim for us to produce a cut-down version of the manuscript. We have significantly
reduced this section of the manuscript focusing on the core results and directing the reader to the
supplementary table where further information is available.
– two pages are dealing with the footprint of a plastid gene ancestry in the H. catenoides genome
assembly (L 369-413), but the conclusions are very vague and “inconclusive“. Delete.
We understand the reviewers point of view here. However, we must note, evolutionary biology is full
of hypotheses where it is impossible to prove a negative. Specifically, an endosymbiotic pattern is
posited, genes of endosymbiotic ancestry are looked for. If they are found the hypothesis is supported.
If they are not found the hypothesis cannot be refuted because you cannot prove a negative over
patterns of extensive gene loss. This pattern of science is very evident in the field, to its detriment.
Taking the point of view that results cannot be published because they are “inconclusive”, which is
what the reviewer is suggesting here, essentially reinforces the position where research can only find
in favour of the null hypothesis (endosymbiotic ancestry) and therefore the alternative hypothesis (no
endosymbiotic ancestry) is ‘un-falsifiable’. So, where we agree this section is “inconclusive”, we are
very keen not to perpetuate this state of affairs and we therefore would like to record as part of this
paper that we looked for plastid ancestry genes and found very little evidence. To compromise with
regards the reviewer’s suggestion we have moved the majority of this section to the supplementary
materials. We link this section into the discussion of the organelle genomes so that a reader can find
this analysis in the supplementary materials if desired.
– Move the section describing the viral integration across the Pseudofungi and the organelle
genomes after the discussion of the protein repertoire.
Done, but we note consistent with the suggestion to reduce and focus this paper the discussion of
organelle genomes has been moved to the supplementary materials.
Additional comments:
– Insert a figure in the Introduction presenting Hyphochytrium catenoides and its main
morphological features;
Done, thank you for the suggestion
– The conclusions on the evolution of secreted CAZymes should be supported by CAFE
(expansion/contraction of gene families) and NOTUNG gene tree/species tree reconciliation analyses
focusing on gene families encoding enzymes thought to be involved in plant cell wall (PCW)
degradation. This also apply to other key protein studied in this work.
The CAZY enzyme analysis the reviewer is referring to are summarised in figure 2. The purpose of this
figure is to illustrate that Hyphochytrium has a reduced set of secreted proteins and specifically a
reduced set of CAZY secreted enzymes when compared to majority of the oomycetes. The reviewer is
asking us to specifically identify gene sets that show branch specific expansion and contraction in
these gene families across the pseudofungi. As this figure demonstrates that the patterns of expansion
are likely to be associated with specific radiations within the oomycetes this is an analysis which is not
directly related to the genome analysis of Hyphochytrium. Furthermore, this is a huge topic and has,
in part, been the topic of multiple additional studies [6-8].
The reviewer asks us to conduct CAFÉ and NOTUNG analysis, essentially conducting a pipeline
analysis to identify expansion and contraction metrics in the oomycetes. We have experience in these
approaches and we find them very unreliable when they are compared to ‘proper’ manually checked
phylogenetic analysis (which is hardly ever done in the field or published papers). This makes for
inaccurate conclusions. As such, we would not want to conduct such analyses without careful manual
checks of the alignments and trees for every gene family analysed. Through-out this paper we have
been very careful to back up similar pipeline analysis relating to gene phylogeny with careful
phylogenetic analysis. As such, we really would like to resist adding this extra and some-what
superficial analysis that will make no substantive addition to the current paper.
This is not to say that we do not see the value in conducting gene family
expansion/contraction analysis in the oomycetes - specifically, as the reviewer suggests, indeed we
currently have two members of our group who are specifically working on a project focusing on CAZY
enzyme expansion/contraction using fully checked phylogenetic analysis. Importantly as part of this
project we are combining this analysis with functional analysis so that we can link these
expansion/contraction patterns with biochemical/biological function in the oomycetes. As such, I am
sure you can see we are very keen not to step on the feet of this distinct oomycete project. We also
think it is important to stress that this additional analysis would add no more key information to the
analysis of Hyphochytrium as these expansions/contractions would be all within oomycetes, given
current genome sampling and would take an unfeasible amount of time to conduct accurately.
– Table 1 should only list the secreted plant cell wall degrading and secreted protease genes – i.e.
those having a role in saprotrophy;
The purpose of table 1 is to summarise the presence and absence of key genes in hypthochytrium and
other groups. It would introduce an unnecessary bias in perspective to reduce this comparator set to
cell wall degrading and secreted protease genes. Especially as the Pseudofungi group include
numerous lifestyles not just saprotrophy. As such we would prefer to leave these extra rows in the
table as they are found in many other oomycete genome papers and we think the comparisons are
important.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_11
Regarding the phylogenomic tree figure/analysis:
****Reviewer 1 also asks us to identify orthologues and investigate individual tree support
for the nodes reported. Unfortunately, we do not agree with this logic for two main reasons
1) the identification of orthologues is extremely noisy and recovers numerous false positives
R2: Perhaps my suggestion was not clear. I have not asked the authors to identify orthologs.
In order to generate a concatenated alignment, orthologs must have already been
predicted, as the authors state: “We generated a concatenated amino acid alignment of 245
putative orthologues (85 taxa and 71,862 amino acid sites) and including a comprehensive
sampling of eukaryotic taxa based on previously published papers [23].” Tree certainty is a
quick step from there, taking 3 seconds from the 245 best trees (only a problem if this work
is being done on a single desktop computer, and authors do not know how to automate the
process). With only 85 taxa per tree, these should complete rather quickly.
We now understand what the reviewer was requesting. We have now added this extra
analysis along with some additional analysis. Please note we have updated the phylogeny
with improved taxon sampling. This additional analysis includes full bootstrap method,
Astral analysis, and an evaluation of orthologue support within the concatenated phylogeny
using internode consistency index approach (e.g. [1]) as suggested by both reviewers. This
additional analysis has not changed any aspect of the conclusions of our paper.
**** and 2) the resulting orthologous gene phylogenies would be, by their nature, subject
to a higher noise-to-signal ratio, leading to many false phylogenetic results.
R2: The reasoning for the suggested analysis is to identify bias in the alignment coming from
a small subset of genes with a strong conflicting signal, as well as systematic bias in the
dataset. These effects were clearly demonstrated by Salichos and Rokas:
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7449/full/nature12130.html . As they
demonstrate, large alignments usually give 100% bootstrap support for nodes even in the
presence of significant conflict. This has been known for some time:
https://doi.org/10.1080/10635150601146041 The problem of noisy genes can easily be
solved by removing the ortholog groups with low average internode certainty. I am not
suggesting this be done, only that authors present the tree certainty (proportion of the
partitions supporting the hypothesis that results from concatenation) in the dataset. This is
a matter of due diligence to address known problems with concatenation, which is far
simpler than employing alternative methods of combining data. It would be a shame to
include an antiquated phylogenomic analysis in an otherwise excellent manuscript, although
the authors are free to do so. Or why do the phylogenomic analysis at all?
We thank the reviewer for adding some clarity to their request. We now understand what
the reviewer was requesting. We have now added this analysis along with some additional
analysis. We have now calculated internode certainty and we also took this opportunity to
therefore subsample the 50% of the orthologues used in the multigene phylogeny that
showed reduced ‘conflict’ (as suggested by the reviewer as optional). Using this 50% dataset
we recalculated the phylogeny and internode certainty (Fig. S6B and S7B). This showed no
change from the previously reported analysis regarding the placement of Hyphochytrium in
the species phylogeny. These extra analyses have been added and described in the updated
paper.
****As part of our analysis we did identify orthologue families to investigate pseudofungal
specific orthologues (Table S3). To give some indication of the noisy nature of this analysis
an orthologue finding pipeline found over 80 candidate pseudofungal specific orthologues.
R2: I am confused, is the 245 ortholog concatenated matrix patchily populated? There is no
mention of missing data in the methods. Most phylogenomic analyses of species
relationships start with orthologs that are 1 per species.
This refers to the search for pseudofungal specific orthologues which is a separate section of
the paper. Previous comments from this reviewer confused us. We now understand what
the reviewer was requesting, I think we have both been discussing different parts of the
paper, please see the responses above.
****Further, manual analysis (which is not possible on the scale the reviewer is suggesting
for every gene family) demonstrated only 9 of these were correctly identified as
pseudofungal specific orthologues using this pipeline approach. This demonstrates the
messy nature of these types of analyses. This is why we did not go into this data further in
the paper (reviewer 2 also asked us to further reduce this section). The combination of
messy orthologue recovery and the fact that individual gene phylogenies suffer from a high
noise-to-signal ratio is the reason we chose to focus on a comprehensive multi-gene
phylogenetic analysis using a very large concatenated protein alignment.
R2: I am certainly not suggesting manual analysis. One simply breaks the alignment into the
partitions, computes a tree for each partition, and calculates internode agreement among
the resulting trees. Were the orthologs put into the matrix added manually? Presumably,
the individual alignments already exist, because aligning the concatenated alignment would
certainly not work correctly, especially with missing sequences. The methods are not
detailed in this regard.
This refers to the search for pseudofungal specific orthologues which is a separate section of
the paper. Previous comments from this reviewer confused us. We now understand what
the reviewer was requesting, please see above.
Conclusion to all discussion on this figure/analysis: I can go along with the tree being drawn
this way for illustration purposes (not providing weight to one hypothesis or another in
stramenopile diversification), and therefore does not warrant a more thorough examination
of the matrix, which would require significant additional compute time. I do think this
makes bootstrap values superfluous. The initial suggestion would be more than reasonable
if the aim were to infer the phylogeny of this group.
Further comments from the reviewer have allowed us to figure out what they were
requesting. This additional analysis has been added as described above.
Other replies:
R2: The figure legends in the generated PDF are sometimes the supplementary legends and
sometimes the main text legends when I download (this is not the authors’ fault
apparently).
We will make sure this is correct for later submissions/proofs.
****As discussed in the paper this gene fusion is present in a number of oomycetes, e.g. P.
infestans XP_002998554 and is present in the Hypho transcriptome on one contig
"contig09799" so is unlikely to be an annotation artefact. It is encoded on a putative nuclear
contig so it is unlikely to be an operon.
R2: I find this rather unsatisfying given the recent evidence of operons in fungi. I think either
a brief mention that an operon cannot be excluded because proteomics were not
performed, or a statement of sequence observations that make an operon unlikely would
suffice.
We have added a short statement confirming that we cannot exclude that possibility of an
operon.
R2: Second (B) should be (C) in Figure 1 legend.
This is fixed. Thank you

Leonard et al presents the genome sequence of the pseudofungus Hyphochytrium
catenoides with detailed analyses of its coding potential. I found the paper to be well-
written and interesting, I only have a few minor points to add. Most important of these is
my suggestion to run a partitioned RAxML ML analysis as a surrogate to the questionable
IQ-Tree analysis (see below).
We have run a range of additional phylogenetic analysis on the suggestion of reviewer 2 see
above. This also includes a partitioned analysis. This new analysis along with a range of
others requested by reviewer two have been added.
A further analysis that the authors might find useful is to calculate the enrichment of pfam
domains in H. catenoides vs. other stramenopiles or that of pseudofungi vs. other
eukaryotes using a hypergeometric test. This would detect all expanded pfams in the study
group and would assign p-values to expansions, while correcting for differences in proteome
sizes.
As discussed in our previous replies to reviewers, which I am not sure reviewer three saw,
we are currently conducting a range of expansions and contraction analysis across both the
stramenopiles and the pseudofungi. As discussed previously these topics are best viewed in
the wider context of stramenopile evolution and there are multiple people in our research
group specifically focusing on this subject. As such we would prefer to not go into this area
in this already large paper. We also note that previously reviewer 1 and 2 recommended
significant reductions. We are therefore not keen to expand the paper further.
Minor comments:
line-78: maybe add some details here on how the genome was sequenced?
Previous reviewers have asked us to remove a huge amount of detail previously given to the
methods etc. In the Results and Discussion, we specifically sign post the fact this
information is given in the methods.
line-81: I’m not sure how often the alignment parcentage of transcriptome data is used as a
measure of genome completeness? Since both can be incomplete to an unknown extent,
the 97% alignability might be misleading.
Transcriptomes are always partial. We are not seeking to evaluate the completeness of the
transcriptome nor did we report an attempt to do so. However, it is an established
approach for examining genome completeness to test how much of the transcriptome can
be recovered from the genome. As such the vast majority of all a transcriptome identified
should be identifiable from a genome, if the genome is near complete. The reverse analysis
is of course meaningless, but we did not do this. Low recovery of transcriptome from
genome indicates one needs to do more sequencing or a better job of assembly to complete
the genome. Our transcriptome to genome analysis demonstrates that the genome is likely
very near complete.
Also, how do the authors explain the BUSCO value of 52%? This seems too low compared to
the CEGMA figures.
This was discussed in the previous submission, but the other reviewers asked us to remove
it. BUSCO v1 was only derived from animals and fungi. So BUSCO comparison to anything
that is not an animal or fungi often renders ‘low’ percentage results. We show in figure 1
BUSCO is consistently low in multiple Stramenopiles. We have added back the text the
previous reviewers asked us to remove explaining the shortcoming of BUSCO.
“Both CEGMA and BUSCO (v1.2) are likely to underestimate the completeness of genomes, as the
core gene list is derived from a subset of eukaryotic genomes that does not fully sample a diverse
collection of eukaryotic genomes (e.g. BUSCO version 1.2 only samples fungi and metazoan
genomes), which inevitably gives a much lower estimation of completion.”
line-138-139: please note that the recommendation of the author’s of IQ-Tree is to run 10-
100000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates. Since the UF bootstrap uses a less efficient branch
swapping algorithm, it tends to overestimate BS percentages. I would prefer to see how
these figures compare to 100 conventional bootstrap reps in RAxML.
Given the clearer comments from Reviewer 2 above, we have added additional analysis
including 100 standard bootstrap analysis. All nodes key to the results discussed in this
paper are still strongly supported using standard bootstrap analysis.
line-139: please include actual numbers of bs% in Fig S6 instead of dots.
Done, but with the following conventions: “Bootstrap values below 50% are denoted as a *.
Circles denote 99% or above values from all tree topology support analyses.
line-141: as a discretionary comment, I expect a raxml analysis with 100 bootstrap replicates
to be feasible computationally if a computing cluster is available to the authors. Would be
an interesting comparison, even if ran on a subset of the 85 taxa.
We have added a range of additional phylogenetic analyses on the recommendation of both
reviewers including using RAXML for to evaluate internode certainty (IC) scores and conducting
100 ‘standard’ bootstrap replicates, this new analysis although intensive did not change any of
the conclusions in our manuscript
line-171: please cross check gene ids with this statement and Fig S7. I could not find
‘Hypho2016_00003038 ’ on the fig.
Corrected.
line-192: maybe you mean secreted proteases?
We are confused by this comment and have checked this line to make sure it is correct.
line-213: gene tree: species tree reconciliation could provide an explicit answer to that
question.
Such analysis, given current taxon sampling would, in our opinion, not provide an explicit
answer of whether genes have been lost on the Hyphochytrium branch or gained on the
Hyphochytrium branch. We also note, as discussed before, that we are currently conducting
a range of expansions and contraction analysis across both the stramenopiles and the
pseudofungi. As discussed previously these topics are best viewed in the wider context of
stramenopile evolution and there are multiple people in our research group specifically
focusing on this subject. As such we would prefer not to go into this area in this already
large paper. We also note that previously reviewer 1 and 2 recommended significant
reductions. We are therefore not keen to expand the paper further.
line-215: 218: this sentence is hard to follow, could you rephrase?
Done
line-221: including pfam ID-s in Table S3 would be useful.
Done
line-336: what is paralogue family expansion? please rephrase
Rephrased
line-395 and elsewhere: I’m wondering if ‘under sampled’ is better written as
undersampled?
Two uses changed
line-613: please include more detail on how the concatenated alignment was made. How
were single-gene alignments made and overly variable sites treated? Also, was the
concatenated dataset partitioned by gene? As there is a chance for LBA to be in action,
these are important parameters.
Extra information is provided in this draft. We have added a range of additional
phylogenetic analyses on the recommendation of both reviewers these include specific
analysis using a gene partitioned approach. We also conducted additional analysis with
conflicting datasets removed and added additional phylogenetic trees (Fig S6B and S7B).
line-712: what does ‘…’ stand for?
Removed
line-716: ‘All number…’ this is sort of useless without specifying those genome portals.
Maybe you could cite more specific sources or publications where these metrics are
reported?
Table with source material included. Apologies this should have been clearer.
