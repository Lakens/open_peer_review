Authored by: Justin Flatt & Sarah Butcher
This review summarizes the events occurring during adenovirus entry from cell attachment to
genome delivery at the nuclear pore. The authors focus their attention on the role of the internal
capsid protein VI as a driving and coordinating force of adenovirus entry. In addition, the
authors present the cell as an obligatory open functional network that is susceptible to viral
intervention secured by intrinsic control mechanisms.
On the whole, this manuscript is well written largely covering the existing literature. The authors
favor an unorthodox writing style, which in my opinion sometimes lacks immediate clarity (see
below). Still, I enjoyed reading this review and think it provides a comprehensive and interesting
read.
In principle, the authors provide a description of generic adenovirus entry, which is legitimate,
often referring to references using in depth characterization of HAdV-C2 or C5 at high MOI in
conventional cell culture models (e.g. HeLa cells). An important point that the authors should
mention more clearly is that host species, cell type and virus type can substantially influence the
entry pathway and the associated immune response (e.g. PMID:17707546, PMID:11152512). E.g.
most of the TRIM21 work was performed in murine cells, while AdV is not permissive in murine
cells.
The authors may consider the following points
- Protein VI is certainly not the only protein directing entry even if it has been investigated more
profoundly and plays an important role. Thus, stating that “AdV gains targeted control of the cell
network with JUST A SINGLE protein” (abstract) should be put into context. Then again, protein
VI plays an important role in assembly, maturation (protease activation), capsid stability (see
below) and nuclear import of hexon, which is maybe worth mentioning.
- AdV (partial) disassembly during entry occurs at defined steps/barriers that allow to overcome
the obstacle to continue with the entry process. Please avoid phrases that suggest otherwise (e.g
“As the virus travels through the cell … cues progressively induce conformational changes (part
2), “particles can fall apart in the cell” (part 2).
- Part 2 is numbered twice and so is part 6
- Please clarify (simplify) the text in the cell networks part (part 2) especially the second
paragraph. To have a more practical connection you may consider to combine this part with the
description of the innate sensing at the end of the cytosolic transport part (part 7).
3
- Immune detection does not only result in autophagy and immunophagy (last sentence part 2)
- I slightly disagree with the term “introduction of foreign matter” in part 2. Is it not more an
“out-of-place detection” (e.g. DNA in the cytosol or endosome, glycosylated proteins in the
cytosol) ? (part2)
- Part 3 is very general and could be combined with part 4
- Point out that host species, cell type and virus type can substantially influence the entry
pathway
- Macropinocytosis may only be relevant at high MOI. (part 5)
- The authors should consider to give the adenovirus temperature sensitive mutant AdVts1
and/or the AdV-pVI-L40Q mutant as an example for the importance of protein VI in regulating
capsid stability, endosome penetration and endosomal escape (e.g. PMID:21209115,
PMID:24027314, PMID:25473051, PMID:19563809) (part 5-6)
- Maybe it is worthwhile to point out more clearly that endosomal rupture and escape from the
endosomal compartment are two separate events (e.g. PMID:22855481) (part 5).

This review article by Flatt and Butcher describes an overview and recent knowledge about
cytoplasmic transport of adenoviruses, as well as interactions with host mechanisms during the
process. By referring to structural and biochemical evidence, the manuscript widely covers topics,
4
from entry into host cells to genome uncoating at nuclear pore complexes, and is described in a
well-balanced manner. Overall, I feel the manuscript provides the general, up-to-date view for
adenoviral trafficking mechanisms and is of good quality as a review article. Therefore, I have
only a few minor points that may need to be addressed as follows.
1. In the Abstract and Conclusions, protein VI appears to be featured among other viral proteins.
However, the main text describes general topics on adenoviral transport without specific focus on
the protein. Although it is clear that protein VI is a key player in several processes mentioned in
the manuscript, the Abstract would need to be more balanced according to the contents of the
manuscript.
2. I feel some parts of the text are a bit difficult to follow. For instance, page 1 gives a general
introduction, page 2 explains specific structural features of adenoviruses, page 3 goes back to a
general topic on host-virus interactions, and then page 4 is again about adenoviruses.
Reorganizing the text would increase readability.
3. Subheads are mislabeled: 1. Introduction, 2. Adenoviruses are built for cellular networking,
and “2”. Cell networks are open but protective against viral infection.

r Reviewers,
thank you for reviewing the manuscript and providing useful feedback. We believe that the revised
ion has been greatly improved. Please find our responses to specific comments below.
ponses to Reviewer 1
rinciple, the authors provide a description of generic adenovirus entry, which is legitimate, often
rring to references using in depth characterization of HAdV-C2 or C5 at high MOI in conventional cell
ure models (e.g. HeLa cells). An important point that the authors should mention more clearly is that
t species, cell type and virus type can substantially influence the entry pathway and the associated

rine cells, while AdV is not permissive in murine cells.
nk you for the comment. We have added a couple of sentences and references to the manuscript (see
ion 4: Adenovirus delivery across cellular networks) to briefly discuss this important point.
ection 4:
ost of what we currently know about AdV entry pathways is the result of experimentation using either
2 or AdV5 at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) in conventional cell culture systems (e.g., HeLa cells).
review is thus largely AdV2/5-centric, however, it is important to note that the virus type, cell type,
host species significantly influence the entry pathway, as well as the associated immune response (45,

GLE protein” (abstract) should be put into context. Then again, protein VI plays an important role in
embly, maturation (protease activation), capsid stability (see below) and nuclear import of hexon, which
aybe worth mentioning.
comments about protein VI are well taken. The text has been modified in several places.
he abstract
ead of "...topology and multifunctional nature of just a single viral protein, protein VI." it now reads
te centered on the interactional topology and multifunctional nature of protein VI."
he last paragraph of section 3:
maturation via the viral protease..." is written "...maturation via a protein VI-activated viral protease..."
ection 9:
o, during the final stage of delivery, protein VI molecules mediate import of newly synthesized hexon
the nuclear compartment so that virus assembly can occur. Protein VI is able to shuttle between the
plasm and nucleus because it contains nuclear import and export signals in its C-terminus (119). In the
plasm, protein VI forms a complex with hexon, and then recruits importins a and ß to promote
slocation through the NPC (119). Following formation of new capsids, maturation results in removal of
C-terminal transport signals from protein VI, which switches the functionality of protein VI away from
porting hexon import to a structural role in virus assembly (119)."
V (partial) disassembly during entry occurs at defined steps/barriers that allow to overcome the
tacle to continue with the entry process. Please avoid phrases that suggest otherwise (e.g “As the virus
els through the cell … cues progressively induce conformational changes (part 2), “particles can fall
rt in the cell” (part 2).
ection 3 it now reads:
ring cell entry, environmental cues progressively induce conformational changes in the structural
teins of the incoming virion to promote stepwise disassembly, and to direct the virus to the site of
ication."
psids are sturdy enough to prevail against the internal pressure of the confined genome, which for AdVs
stimated to be ~30 atm (28), and at the same time, they can be utilized for directed transport and
trolled release once inside cells (29, 30)."
t 2 is numbered twice and so is part 6
numbering issue has been fixed.
ase clarify (simplify) the text in the cell networks part (part 2) especially the second paragraph. To have
ore practical connection you may consider to combine this part with the description of the innate
sing at the end of the cytosolic transport part (part 7).
nk you for the suggestion to move the description on innate sensing into the section covering cell
works. We have reorganized the text (see Section 2: Cell networks are open but protective against viral
ction) and this has nicely improved the flow of the manuscript.
mune detection does not only result in autophagy and immunophagy (last sentence part 2)
sentence commenting about immune detection, autophagy, and immunophagy is no longer in the
nuscript. It was removed when reworking the description of innate immunity into the section covering
networks. See section 2. Cell networks are open but protective against viral infection in the revised
ion of the paper.
ightly disagree with the term “introduction of foreign matter” in part 2. Is it not more an “out-of-place
ection” (e.g. DNA in the cytosol or endosome, glycosylated proteins in the cytosol) ? (part2)
sentence containing "introduction of foreign matter" is no longer in the manuscript. It was removed

networks are open but protective against viral infection in the revised version of the paper.
t 3 is very general and could be combined with part 4
have now combined sections 3 and 4 (Section 4. Receptor binding and initiation of the uncoating
gram).
nt out that host species, cell type and virus type can substantially influence the entry pathway
have added text and references to section 4:
ost of what we currently know about AdV entry pathways is the result of experimentation using either
2 or AdV5 at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) in conventional cell culture systems (e.g., HeLa cells).

host species significantly influence the entry pathway, as well as the associated immune response (45,
"
cropinocytosis may only be relevant at high MOI. (part 5)
now mention in the section on macropinocytosis:
dence suggests that AdV endosomal escape is dependent on having an activated macropinocytic
hway, though such a connection may only be relevant at high MOI (79)."
e authors should consider to give the adenovirus temperature sensitive mutant AdVts1 and/or the AdV-
-L40Q mutant as an example for the importance of protein VI in regulating capsid stability, endosome
etration and endosomal escape (e.g. PMID:21209115, PMID:24027314, PMID:25473051,
ID:19563809) (part 5-6)
nk you for bringing this to our attention. We have now included a new sentence with appropriate
rences in section 6:
e rupturing capacity of protein VI, as well as its role in regulating capsid stability and endosomal escape
e been studying in great detail using a temperature sensitive mutant of human adenovirus 2 and a
ant virus with single point mutation in in protein VI, LQ40 (89-93)."
ybe it is worthwhile to point out more clearly that endosomal rupture and escape from the endosomal
partment are two separate events (e.g. PMID:22855481) (part 5).
have included the following the following sentence in part 7.Escape from endosomes and host
ection:
ecifically, during endosomal breakage and virus escape, which are spatially and temporally distinct
nts (95), compartmentalized glycans are released to the cytosol where in the foreign context they elicit
utophagic response that is selective in eliminating the damaged components that could become toxic
he cell (see Figure 2 autophagy) (98)."
ponses to Reviewer 2
n the Abstract and Conclusions, protein VI appears to be featured among other viral proteins. However,
main text describes general topics on adenoviral transport without specific focus on the protein.
ough it is clear that protein VI is a key player in several processes mentioned in the manuscript, the
tract would need to be more balanced according to the contents of the manuscript.
