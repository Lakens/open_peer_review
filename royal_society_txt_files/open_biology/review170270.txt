Bresson and Tollervey discuss conserved regulatory mechanisms that govern transcript quality
control and stability during eukaryotic cell growth and division. The review begins with the
surveillance machinery that mainly consists of 5’- and 3’-exonucleases, rather than
endonucleases, which means that it is susceptible to inhibition by protective modifications of
transcript ends. The manuscript then covers major steps in transcript synthesis (elongation,
splicing, termination), the role of polyA binding proteins in RNA stability, and finally the role of
the nuclear surveillance machinery in the degradation of various types of transcripts with unclear
coding potential.
The authors put forward the quite plausible concept that nuclear RNA degradation is a default
pathway that destroys all transcripts, coding and non-coding alike, unless they are protected by
sequence features and RNA binding proteins. The review comprehensively covers known
mechanisms relevant for RNA stability during mitotic growth and division very clearly and the
major points are well-illustrated in rather captivating figures (apart perhaps from Fig. 4 that is
informative but slightly less elaborate than the other figures).
The author’s concept has interesting implications. When the surveillance machinery’s activity is
impaired in certain (suboptimal) growth conditions, during stress, disease (and therapy) or when
cells undergo developmental pathways, then normally more or less unstable transcripts will
accumulate. This would likely include putative (long) non-coding RNAs that might have
important functions under these conditions. Their usefulness might make the drawback of
simultaneous accumulation of faulty mRNAs acceptable to the cell, especially during processes
such as stress, where survival has priority, or gametogenesis, where protein translation is down-
regulated because it is not needed in spores or sperm.
Escaping from the nucleus appears to be one efficient way for transcripts to avoid being
degraded. In this context, it is interesting that Brar et al. report numerous cases of meiotic
putative lncRNAs being associated with ribosomes, which leads to the synthesis of small proteins
that may (or may not) have important roles in the process (Brar et al., Science 2012; Hollerer et al.,
Proteomics 2017).
In light of these considerations I regret that the review does not include a brief section, which
discusses how the mitotic surveillance activity might be altered in and adapted to developmental
pathways such as gamete formation.

Comments to the Author

Recent advances in transcriptome analyses have lead to the identification of many RNA species,
some relevant for biological processes and others as failed or aberrant by-products of
transcription, rapidly turned over by the RNA decay machinery. Rapidly turned over RNA could
be associated with co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. RNA could be
degraded by the 5’ exonucleases Xrn1/2 or the 3’ exonuclease complex RNA exosome (with the
assistance of many cofactors). In this review, Bresson et al. provide a comprehensive description
of these RNA decay processes. It is a refreshing read coming from a laboratory that pioneered our
understanding of the eukaryotic RNA exosome complex. As with any review article, there is
only so much that can be covered and some references have been missed. Below, I have
suggested some additional points and references the authors could incorporate that I deem
relevant to the focus of the review. Overall, this is a review/point of view article that covers an
exciting field of RNA biology and should be published soon.
1. In the abstract of the review, the authors mention that “It is likely that bona fide transcripts are
specifically protected, particularly by 5’ and 3’ modifications.” In the remainder of the article
there is sufficient discussion regarding capping associated modification and end phosphorylation
of RNA. But new studies have highlighted other RNA modifications, either at the 5’ end or the 3’
tail, such as m6A, m1A (Roundtree et al., Cell 2017); the process of dynamic RNA modifications
may also have a role in RNA stability. The authors could consider these thoughts and expand
their “modification” discussion.
4
2. An interesting idea that has been proposed is “Antisense transcripts can hybridize to
complementary sense RNA, forming double stranded RNAs that may enter the RNA interference
pathway.” Does evidence for this mechanism in higher eukaryotes exist or is this technique
limited to yeast? In this regard, the role of RNA exosome in heterochromatin silencing has been
evaluated in S. pombe and inclusion of this concept could be a nice addition (Reyes-Turcu NSMB
2011; Yamanaka et al., Nature 2011; Buhler et al., PLoS Biol. 2007).
3. The authors succinctly mention that one of the major requirements for rapid RNA turnover in
the nucleus is related to the prevention of genomic instability due to formation of RNA/DNA
hybrids “Excess RNA, particularly if poorly packaged, can also bind to homologous gene loci,
forming harmful RNA:DNA hybrids that are associated with DNA double-strand breaks.” These
observations were described in S. cerevisiae (Wahba et al., Mol Cell 2011) and subsequently in
mammalian cells (Pefanis et al., Nature 2014 and Lim et al., Cell 2017). Moreover, the DNA/RNA
hybrids can be rescued by RNaseH1 treatment. These observations link RNA decay with genomic
instability caused by collisions of transcription/replication machineries or due to DNA mutating
agents like APOBECs/AID etc. This body of work could be mentioned as it may be of interest to
the readership.
4. Continuing from point #3, the authors consider 3’-end and 5’-end degradation as a part of
RNA surveillance. Is degradation of the RNA on the DNA (that is, part of a DNA/RNA hybrid)
by the RNaseH1 protein a part of this RNA surveillance mechanism? It would be nice to learn the
perspective of the authors on this point since RNaseH may coordinate with RNA decay to enforce
overall RNA surveillance. Many labs have published on this topic (nicely described in Santos-
Pereira and Aguilera, Nature Reviews Genetics, 2015) and it remains an important topic.
5. A recent study (Chiu et al, Mol Cell 2018) indicates that PAS site polyadenylated RNAs in the
sense direction are rapidly turned over by the RNA exosome. As this study suggests the role of
RNA exosome in preventing accumulation of transcription byproducts and supports the overall
focus of the review, I would expect the authors would like to incorporate a discussion of it into
this manuscript.
6. Finally, a paragraph regarding future directions for investigation and burning questions could
be included.

Appendix A
We thank the referees for their thoughtful comments.
Referee: 1
The only substantive criticism was:
I regret that the review does not include a brief section, which discusses how the mitotic
surveillance activity might be altered in and adapted to developmental pathways such as
gamete formation.
We certainly agree that alterations in the regulation of RNA processing and surveillance
during development and meiosis is an important and very topical subject. However, this is a
big field that we feel could not be done justice in a brief section. It would really warrant a
review in it is own right.
Referee: 2
1. In the abstract of the review, the authors mention that “It is likely that bona fide
transcripts are specifically protected, particularly by 5’ and 3’ modifications.” In the remainder
of the article there is sufficient discussion regarding capping associated modification and
end phosphorylation of RNA. But new studies have highlighted other RNA modifications,
either at the 5’ end or the 3’ tail, such as m6A, m1A (Roundtree et al., Cell 2017); the
process of dynamic RNA modifications may also have a role in RNA stability. The authors
could consider these thoughts and expand their “modification” discussion.
In higher eukaryotes, these modifications have a wide range of reported functions. However,
the review is focused on yeast, in which the functional significance of these modifications
remains unclear. We have therefore included discussion of the base-modification in the new
future directions section, proposed by the referee (p19).
2. An interesting idea that has been proposed is “Antisense transcripts can hybridize to
complementary sense RNA, forming double stranded RNAs that may enter the RNA
interference pathway.” Does evidence for this mechanism in higher eukaryotes exist or is
this technique limited to yeast? In this regard, the role of RNA exosome in heterochromatin
silencing has been evaluated in S. pombe and inclusion of this concept could be a nice
addition (Reyes-Turcu NSMB 2011; Yamanaka et al., Nature 2011; Buhler et al., PLoS Biol.
2007).
This pathway is absent from S.cerevisiae and, as far as we know, has not been established
in humans. It is, of course, important in many other systems and particularly plants, but we
would prefer to retain the focus of the review on the budding yeast and human systems.
3. The authors succinctly mention that one of the major requirements for rapid RNA
turnover in the nucleus is related to the prevention of genomic instability due to formation of
RNA/DNA hybrids “Excess RNA, particularly if poorly packaged, can also bind to

decay to enforce overall RNA surveillance. Many labs have published on this topic (nicely
described in Santos-Pereira and Aguilera, Nature Reviews Genetics, 2015) and it remains
an important topic.
We have included further discussion of RNase H activity and its potential role in RNA
surveillance (p12-13).
5. A recent study (Chiu et al, Mol Cell 2018) indicates that PAS site polyadenylated
RNAs in the sense direction are rapidly turned over by the RNA exosome. As this study
suggests the role of RNA exosome in preventing accumulation of transcription byproducts

We thank the referee for pointing out this very recent publication, which we have included in
the revised MS (p16).

questions could be included.
