Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In both invertebrates and vertebrates, animal skins are innervated by sensory neurons that allow
animals to sense and respond to the external world. Although the sensory neurites closely
associate with epidermal cells, the interactions between neurites and epidermal cells have not
been carefully characterized until recently. In the manuscript by Yang and Chien, the authors
attempt to summarize our current knowledge on these interactions, by primarily focusing on
work done in C. elegans and Drosophila. Although there are already good reviews that cover
similar subjects (e.g. Dong et al, Annu Rev Physiol 2015), this manuscript discusses some of the
more recent findings. In this regard, the review could be a welcomed addition to the literature.
On the other hand, in my opinion, the manuscript suffers from several important deficits. I would
only be supportive for the publication of this review in Open Biology if these issues are
satisfyingly addressed.
Major comments:
1. The scope of the review is kind of narrow in my opinion. There is a larger body of work on this
topic in recent literature that the authors seemed to have ignored. First, nice work has been done
in vertebrate systems like zebrafish to investigate sensory neurite/epidermal cell interactions
(Wang et al, Current Biology, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.040; Rasmussen et al, J Neurosci,
2015, DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3613-14.2015). I understand that the authors chose to focus on
work done in worms and flies, but the interactions in the zebrafish are very similar to the those
discussed in the manuscript and have added to our understanding of neurite/epidermis
interactions as a whole. These should at least be acknowledged. Second, even in the Drosophila
literature, there are important work missed by the manuscript. Some examples are DOI
10.1016/j.devcel.2010.02.010; DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.062; DOI 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.09.001.
The findings reported in these studies should be discussed.
2. The structure of this manuscript is awkward. It starts by describing the PVD system in C.
elegans, which is followed by two sections of how PVD dendrites are affected by the hypoderm.
But the Drosophila da neuron system was introduced as a part of the second section, where the
introduction took a large space. The relevant Drosophila work for this section is only a smaller
part at the end of the second section. The rest of the manuscript is then focused on Drosophila
work only. This organization makes the manuscript hard to follow. I suggest introducing both
systems in the beginning and then grouping worm and fly work under appropriate sections.
There should also be discussions on how similar and how different the fly and worm systems are.
3. The writing in many places lacks clarity or is confusing. This is especially true in later part of
the manuscript when fly work was discussed. Those places could probably be understood only
by experts working on these specific systems. However, the purpose of writing a review is to
3
inform non-experts on specific topics. I suggest the authors to carefully revise the text so that
scientists who are not in the field can also understand it.
Here are just a few examples of the confusing writing. On page 9, “This self-avoidance
mechanism simply maximizes the branching coverage without needing of directing every single
dendrite growth.” This sentence is very hard to understand. In the next sentence “Although the
lumen between the muscle and epidermis is spacious…”, I don’t think the space between the
muscle and the epidermis can be called a lumen because muscles and the epidermis do not form a
concealed compartment. The next sentence, “Indeed, confocal imaging reveals the dorsal field of
a Drosophila larvae hemi-segment to be covered by hundreds of dendritic branches distributed
within a narrow space”. It would be very hard for non-experts to imagine what is the narrow
space the authors refer to. On page 10, “the Semaphorin ligand and receptor” is confusing.
Probably “a semaphorin ligand and its receptor” is more accurate.
On page 10 in the section of “Fragmented dendrite engulfment during dendrite pruning”, the
sentence “Studies of axon pruning…” lacks the necessary contexts for people to understand it.
What axons? Which systems?
4. The figures are not as helpful as they could be. Since the review is about interactions between
sensory dendrites and epidermal cells, diagrams illustrating the spatial organization of these two
types of tissues in C. elegans and Drosophila are necessary. Also it would be helpful to include
figures summarizing the major ways epidermal cells regulate dendrite morphogenesis.
5. Lastly, I think the English writing of the manuscript should be improved. It may be
appropriate to seek help from English editing service.
Minor comments:
1. In the last sentence of the abstract, “myriad” is not accurate because it means “numerous”. But
in fact the paper only talked about five roles of epidermis.
2. I am not sure if the C. elegans PVD neurons can be considered as space-filling neurons and I
have not seen them referred to as such in the literature. Unlike space-filling neurons in the fly and
the zebrafish, PVD dendrites do not fully cover the body surface.
3. In the first paragraph, the claim of “mainly through studies of Drosophila and C. elegans” is
not correct. Important work on the interactions between sensory neurites and the epidermis has
also been done Zebrafish.
4. On page 8, the authors mentioned that class IV da neurons appear around 16 hr AEL, but in the
literature the earliest time these neurons were observed is in stage-16 embryos at around 13 hr
AEL (Grueber et al, Current Biology, 2003; Han et al; PNAS, 2011).

Major comments:
1. The scope of the review is kind of narrow in my opinion. There is a larger
body of work on this topic in recent literature that the authors seemed to have

investigate sensory neurite/epidermal cell interactions (Wang et al, Current Biology,
2012, DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.040; Rasmussen et al, J Neurosci, 2015,
DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3613-14.2015). I understand that the authors chose to
focus on work done in worms and flies, but the interactions in the zebrafish are very
similar to the those discussed in the manuscript and have added to our understanding
of neurite/epidermis interactions as a whole. These should at least be acknowledged.
Second, even in the Drosophila literature, there are important work missed by the
manuscript. Some examples are DOI 10.1016/j.devcel.2010.02.010; DOI
10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.062; DOI 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.09.001. The findings
reported in these studies should be discussed.
We are graceful to this reminding.
(1) The zebrafish works have been cited as well as discussed and in the ending of
“Stabilizing new branches” section in page 8, and in the section of “Engulfment
of fragmented dendrites during pruning”in the top of page 12.
(2) The fly works have also been cited and discussed as:
(a) DOI 10.1016/j.devcel.2010.02.010 is in the section of “Reshaping dendrites”
in page 12-13.
(b) DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.062 is in the section of “Concluding remarks
and future prospects” in page 13.
(c) DOI 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.09.001 is in the section of “Restricting dendritic
branching within a thin two-dimensional space” in page 11.
2. The structure of this manuscript is awkward. It starts by describing the PVD
system in C. elegans, which is followed by two sections of how PVD dendrites are
affected by the hypoderm. But the Drosophila da neuron system was introduced as a
part of the second section, where the introduction took a large space. The relevant
Drosophila work for this section is only a smaller part at the end of the second
section. The rest of the manuscript is then focused on Drosophila work only. This
organization makes the manuscript hard to follow. I suggest introducing both
systems in the beginning and then grouping worm and fly work under appropriate
sections. There should also be discussions on how similar and how different the fly
and worm systems are.
We are graceful for reviewer to point out the weakness of our review structure. The
introduction of both systems is reorganized into the beginning and also includes a
simple description of the somatosensory RB neurons in zebrafish. The differences
are discussed in the end paragraph of the introduction.
3. The writing in many places lacks clarity or is confusing. This is especially true
in later part of the manuscript when fly work was discussed. Those places could
probably be understood only by experts working on these specific systems. However,
the purpose of writing a review is to inform non-experts on specific topics. I suggest
the authors to carefully revise the text so that scientists who are not in the field can
also understand it.
Thanks for reminding, we have carefully and largely revised the part of fly works by
expressing ideas and writing sentences clearer as well as easier for reading by
outfield readers.
Here are just a few examples of the confusing writing. On page 9, “This
self-avoidance mechanism simply maximizes the branching coverage without
needing of directing every single dendrite growth.” This sentence is very hard to
understand. In the next sentence “Although the lumen between the muscle and
epidermis is spacious…”, I don’t think the space between the muscle and the
epidermis can be called a lumen because muscles and the epidermis do not form a
concealed compartment. The next sentence, “Indeed, confocal imaging reveals the
dorsal field of a Drosophila larvae hemi-segment to be covered by hundreds of
dendritic branches distributed within a narrow space”. It would be very hard for
non-experts to imagine what is the narrow space the authors refer to. On page 10,
“the Semaphorin ligand and receptor” is confusing. Probably “a semaphorin ligand
and its receptor” is more accurate.
On page 10 in the section of “Fragmented dendrite engulfment during dendrite
pruning”, the sentence “Studies of axon pruning…” lacks the necessary contexts for
people to understand it. What axons? Which systems?
For these specific examples. We have modified the text as below:
(1) The self-avoidance is introduced more in the end of introduction section when
mentioning the differences between class IV da and PVD neurons, through page 4
line 29 to page 5 line 2.
(2) The whole section of“Restricting dendritic branching within a thin
two-dimensional space” is largely rewritten to avoid confusing sentences and
words.
(3) The sentence in the section of“Engulfment of fragmented dendrites during
pruning” is rewritten as“Studies of programed axon pruning in mushroom bodies
during metamorphosis and axon degeneration after injury in olfactory receptor
neurons indicate that glia, the axon-supporting and -ensheathing cells, mediate
clearance of degenerating axons.”in page 11 lines 26-29.
4. The figures are not as helpful as they could be. Since the review is about
interactions between sensory dendrites and epidermal cells, diagrams illustrating the
spatial organization of these two types of tissues in C. elegans and Drosophila are
necessary. Also it would be helpful to include figures summarizing the major ways
epidermal cells regulate dendrite morphogenesis.
We are graceful for reviewer to give us constructive suggestions. We have included
additional figures to illustrate the spatial organization of class IV da/PVD neurons to
the epidermis in Figure 1 and 2. Also, cartoons that describing examples of how
epidermis can regulate dendrite patterning are added in Figure 3.
5. Lastly, I think the English writing of the manuscript should be improved. It
may be appropriate to seek help from English editing service.
We have sent the revision version for English editing.
Minor comments:
1. In the last sentence of the abstract, “myriad” is not accurate because it means
“numerous”. But in fact the paper only talked about five roles of epidermis.
Thanks for reminding, we have changed it into“several aspects” in page 1, line
20.
2. I am not sure if the C. elegans PVD neurons can be considered as space-filling
neurons and I have not seen them referred to as such in the literature. Unlike
space-filling neurons in the fly and the zebrafish, PVD dendrites do not fully cover
the body surface.
Thanks for reminding, we have removed the description of PVD as a space-filling
neuron in the introduction.
3. In the first paragraph, the claim of “mainly through studies of Drosophila and
C. elegans” is not correct. Important work on the interactions between sensory
neurites and the epidermis has also been done Zebrafish.
Thanks for reminding, we have added zebrafish into this sentence and cited a review
for sensory neurites- epidermis interactions in zebrafish in page 2, lines 13-18.
4. On page 8, the authors mentioned that class IV da neurons appear around 16 hr
AEL, but in the literature the earliest time these neurons were observed is in stage-16
embryos at around 13 hr AEL (Grueber et al, Current Biology, 2003; Han et al;
PNAS, 2011).
Thanks for reminding, we have reorganized the sentence as“Imaging of early-stage
class IV da neurons has revealed that dendrite outgrowth starts around 16 hr after
egg laying (AEL), after the epidermal sheet has formed (Parrish, et al., 2009).”in
page 9, lines 18-20.
