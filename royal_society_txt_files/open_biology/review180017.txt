The author provided the comprehensive information of ABHD that is helpful for specialists and
the general readers. Besides, they also showed their study on the structure of ABHD16A.
However two major concerns for publication are as followings:
1. The preciseness of sentences should be promoted;
2. The information should be better organized so that the general readers will follow it easily.

Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123

• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Comments to the Author(s)
The author provided the comprehensive information of ABHD that is helpful for specialists and
the general readers. Besides, they also showed their study on the structure of ABHD16A.
However two major concerns for publication are as followings:
1. The preciseness of sentences should be promoted;
2. The information should be better organized so that the general readers will follow it easily.
The authors’ responses:
We are very grateful for the editor’s approval and excellent revision suggestions. In accordance with
these suggestions, we modified the sentences that may be considered imprecise or difficult to
understand. To enhance clarity for the general reader, we reorganized the information, adjusted the
order of some sentences, and even rewrote the sections we believe to be important. In addition, the
revised manuscript has been checked and modified by American Journal Experts, a well-known
company providing a professional language editing service. The details of language embellishment are
not be enumerated here.The following is a list of the main revisions and key points:
1. In the reivised version, the title is change to “Sequence analysis and structure prediction of
ABHD16A and the roles of the ABHD family members in human disease”. The original title is
“Sequence analysis and structure prediction of the ABHD16A and the roles of ABHD family
members in human disease”The only difference with the first manuscript is the location of the word
“the”.
2. We checked and reorganized the sentences in the abstract to increase conciseness and ensure
that the abstract is informative. To avoid the abrupt appearance of the subject, we added general
information regarding ABHD16A and the ABHDs to provide the readers with preliminary knowledge
of the topic discussed.
3. In the introduction, we replaced “Human ABHD16A gene (BAT5)” with a simple abbreviation
“ABHD16A”, which is defined in the introduction (line 44, the revised version). To enhance clarity
and coherence, we adjusted the order of several sentences. The sentence “ABHD16A is a serine
metabolism enzyme, typically containing…” was moved to line 45-46. Line 47-49 “Especially in
the last 2-3 years, some groups reported…” of the first manuscript was reworded “Particularly
within the prior 2-3 years, several groups have reported that…” in the revised version. The last
sentence of Introduction was reworded to “Significant insights and future developments are also
proposed” from “The significant insights or development in the future were also provided”.
4. In the first manuscrip, Line 87-88, “In addition, there is a highly conserved histidine residue in a
variable loop in the back of ß8” was changed to “In addition, a highly conserved histidine residue is
present in a variable loop behind ß8” after modification, line 93.
5. We inserted the missing “(Table 1)”, line 97, the revised version. In addition, the word“from”was
replaced with“in” in the caption of this table (line 111).
6. We replaced the headline “Research progress of ABHD16A” (line 105, the first manuscript) with
“Research progress related to ABHD16A”( line 112, the revised manuscript). Moreover, the first two
paragrah was re-divided according to the relevance of the content (line 121-122).
7. Similarly, we repaced the word “of” (line 148, the first manuscript) with “related to” ( line 156, the
revised manuscript) .
8. We changed the subhead 6.1 “A direct participant in lipid metabolism” to “Direct contribution to
lipid metabolism” (line 162) according to the suggestion of AJE editor. The others subheads were
changed slightly because the prepositions “for” was replaced with “in”, respectively line 181, 200,
228, 240.
9. We deleted a general descriptional and unnecessary sentence “Palmitoylation modification of
protein is a major posttranslational modification for significant function” , line 265-266 of the first
manuscript.
10. In the competing interests section, we replaced the heading with the more standard “Competing
interests” according to the “Author guidelines” of the Royal Society, line 295.
11. In table 2, we inserted the missing references citations. Consequently, these citations information
were added in the section of References according to their corresponding location by the EndNote
software .
12. In Figure 3A, we showed the three categories in the right of the cladogram.
Thanks again for the hard work of the reviewer and editor!
