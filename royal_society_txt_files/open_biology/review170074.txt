This is an interesting study that describes a novel method for the assignment of streptococcal
species based on sequencing of a variable region of the ribosomal S2 gene. The topic is of
increasing relevance as proper discrimination of streptococcal species is often difficult, albeit
important, when evaluating the impact of pneumococcal vaccines in carriage and disease.
The paper is carefully prepared and well written. The pros and cons of the novel method are
discussed. The paper, in general, provides an in-depth discussion and good review regarding the
topic of streptococcal speciation -with emphasis on pneumococci and related species- using
molecular methods.
Major comment
Lines 141-142; 318-325: Some of the genes that are described as pneumococcal species-specific
were, indeed, initially described as so, but were later found to be occasionally present in other
streptococcal species. This was known prior to the current study - for example for Spn9802, ply
(described in S. mitis as mly), lytA - and should be acknowledged.
Minor comments
Title: The title does not make real justice to the paper as the description and validation of the
novel method is, in this reviewer’s opinion, the key interest of the manuscript. The title could be
changed – this is, of course, a suggestion – to emphasize the novel method.

Wyllie and colleagues adapt one of 53 rMLST genes for use as a molecular tool for
phylogenetically differentiating between S. pneumoniae and other related streptococcal species.
They test this on 200 streptococcal strains obtained from the Netherlands. They further identify
that the molecular targets lytA and piaB were only identified only S. pneumoniae (albeit NOT in
all pneuominae and for paiB only in 3/17 isolates) and proposed these as a further differential
diagnostic targets for S. pneumoniae. Unconvincing data is then discussed about the distribution
of some other classic pneumococcal molecular targets identified within other streptococcal
isolates and potential disease status.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
1. The manuscript title is misleading. This is primarily a S. pneumoniae diagnostics paper. The
weakest part of the manuscript is the data on carriage and disease. The findings are built around
S2 as a possible molecular clustering tool - not disease.
2. Why S2 and not any of the other 52 rMLST alleles? No results or explanation are provided.
What is the rationale behind the sub-region of S2 chosen as a molecular target?
3. There is allelic variation observed in S2 sequences from S pneumoniae. As far as I can tell, the
authors only examined this in context of 221 specimens from the Netherlands and around 70
whole genome sequences. How applicable is this in a global context given that there are
thousands of pneumococcal genome sequences available?
4. Results (from line 187): No result section related to the identification of the S2 region. In the
introduction it is implied that this is a novel identification (line 82/83) “Of the 53 ribosomal
protein (rps) genes analysed in rMLST, we identified a region in rpsB (encoding the 30S
4
ribosomal protein S2) which could potentially discern species of streptococci”. I would like to see
some results as to why the S2 region and not other ? How divergent are the rpsB nucleotide
sequences? Etc
5. Line 22. The use of the term “most pathogenic” in this sentence is a matter of context. In what
context are the authors referring to S. pneumoniae as being the most pathogenic?
6. Line 35/88. The use of specific in this sentence gives the impression that lytA and piaB are in
all S pneumoniae. They are not as stated in the results – this should be noted as these genes
cannot be used as definitive markers which is what is the broader objective.
7. The discussion in general is very long and takes a number of liberties given the results. Lines
304-325 – This section highlights that S2 species grouping is not uniform. I am concerned that the
nature of the limited geographical sampling used in this study may suggest that pneumococcal
strains may also show diversity if the genetic screen was larger. This should be at least discussed.
8. Line 192 – Figure 1. Whole genome phylogeny should be shown rather than ambiguously
stated as “comparable to the results from phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequences on
the PATRIC website”.

Editor's Comments to Author(s):
Your paper has been reviewed by two experts in Streptococcal genetics and phylogeny and their
appraisals are very similar. Both reviewers feel that the title of the manuscript is inappropriate or
even misleading and recommend a change. Furthermore, reviewer 2 feels that you have not
taken full advantage of the thousands of whole genome sequences of Streptococcus pneumoniae
that are available but limited yourselves to 221 from the Netherlands (SPECIFIC COMMENT 3).
Clearly, the paper would have more impact if the largest possible sample were analyzed and the
results found to be concordant. This would render the conclusions more convincing and likely
make the tool more attractive to the diagnostics/microbial identification community.
These two major points must be addressed before we can move forward. The other issues raised
by the reviewers appear to be relatively easy to settle.

r Editor,
thank both reviewers for their thoughtful comments on the original manuscript and hope that they are
ciently addressed in the revised version. In particular we hope that the new title better reflects the
re of our study and that the additional in silico analysis of 1157 pneumococcal genomes strengthens
manuscript. Since Dr Bart Ferwerda and Dr Diederik van de Beek critically contributed to this extra
lysis, we invited both to co-author the manuscript. The authors’ contribution section has been changed
ordingly (lines 501-502). All authors read and approved revised version of the paper.
specific responses to the reviewers’ comments:

thank the reviewer for raising this point. We were indeed aware of these previous reports (references
d in line 89). Based on these previous studies reporting on false positivity in certain assays, we were
rested in testing these on our panel of streptococcal strains with the aim of identifying non-
umococcal streptococcal isolates responsible for such confounding. These assays were generally
eloped for the identification of cultured, individual pneumococcal strains and are used mostly by
nostic labs to confirm S. pneumoniae as etiological agent causing a disease. Here we wanted to
light the necessary precautions when applying these assays to polymicrobial samples of the oral

iewer #2:
lie and colleagues adapt one of 53 rMLST genes for use as a molecular tool for
logenetically differentiating between S. pneumoniae and other related streptococcal species.
y test this on 200 streptococcal strains obtained from the Netherlands. They further identify
the molecular targets lytA and piaB were only identified only S. pneumoniae (albeit NOT in all
umoniae and for paiB only in 3/17 isolates) and proposed these as a further differential
nostic targets for S. pneumoniae. Unconvincing data is then discussed about the distribution
ome other classic pneumococcal molecular targets identified within other streptococcal
ates and potential disease status.
thank the reviewer for raising these important points. In the current study, we decided to include a few
-typeable S. pneumoniae strains as they can often be a source of contention in regards to their
sification as true S. pneumoniae (paragraph starting line 458). While limited in number, S2-typing
vincingly classified all strains identified as non-typeable pneumococci by culture as S. pneumoniae.
hermore, we found it interesting to report on the lack of piaB in the isolates that later proved to be truly
-typeable pneumococci (negative in Quellung, CST and serotyping qPCRs). First, as we discussed in
paper (lines 451-452), this highlighted how the gold standard culture-based method itself is subject to
e positivity, arising from human interpretation of results It was also interesting to note that the truly
-typeable pneumococci were lacking the piaB gene (or at least the region targeted by qPCR). Finally,
n entering the piaB sequence that we target into NCBI blast, 42 hits with 100% homology are returned
DNA sequences from typeable S. pneumoniae strains (next closest DNA sequences were of <20%
ology). In light of these observations, we therefore found it important to discuss how the pia gene has
iously been described as being essential for pneumococcal virulence, and in concordance with that,
non-typeable strains are rarely isolated from invasive pneumococcal disease. We further discuss the
cificity of the piaB-qPCR for pneumococcal detection in response to reviewer’s comment #6.
gards to our further discussion on disease status, our findings suggested an important hypothesis for
C, contradicting earlier reports implicating it in virulence and invasive disease. We were excited by
possible finding which we felt worthy of inclusion for others to also contemplate. Encouragingly, this
since been further supported by a recent paper published by Yamaguchi et al (1). We have updated
text to reflect this (lines 467-469).
gards to the distribution of other classic pneumococcal molecular targets investigated in the study, as
reviewer has mentioned, we indeed tested only a small number of strains. However, even within this
ll random selection of isolates, we find the number of false positive signals when these strains were
ed for ‘other classic pneumococcal molecular targets’ worthy of concern. It is this degree of
ounding that we feel needs to be stressed to researchers and microbiologists in the field.
cific comments
he manuscript title is misleading. This is primarily a S. pneumoniae diagnostics paper. The
kest part of the manuscript is the data on carriage and disease. The findings are built around
as a possible molecular clustering tool - not disease.
thank the reviewer for their feedback and hope our changes to the title are satisfactory.
hy S2 and not any of the other 52 rMLST alleles? No results or explanation are provided. What
e rationale behind the sub-region of S2 chosen as a molecular target?
apologise to the reviewer for our previous lack of explanation on this matter. We have updated the text
m line 141) and hope that our edits satisfy the questions of the reviewer.
here is allelic variation observed in S2 sequences from S pneumoniae. As far as I can tell, the
hors only examined this in context of 221 specimens from the Netherlands and around 70
le genome sequences. How applicable is this in a global context given that there are
usands of pneumococcal genome sequences available?
owing the concerns expressed by the reviewer, we have since analysed the S2-sequences of a further
7 pneumococcal isolates. We have updated the text accordingly (paragraphs starting line 177, 242,
). We are aware this does not fully address reviewer’s concerns about global context, yet hope this
s the reviewer more confidence in our analysis.
esults (from line 187): No result section related to the identification of the S2 region. In the
oduction it is implied that this is a novel identification (line 82/83) “Of the 53 ribosomal protein
) genes analysed in rMLST, we identified a region in rpsB (encoding the 30S ribosomal protein
which could potentially discern species of streptococci”. I would like to see some results as to
the S2 region and not other ? How divergent are the rpsB nucleotide sequences? Etc
hope the additions to our manuscript (from line 141) in response to this comment now satisfies the
ewer and provides greater clarity on this matter.
ine 22. The use of the term “most pathogenic” in this sentence is a matter of context. In what
text are the authors referring to S. pneumoniae as being the most pathogenic?
ed, one can argue there is no ultimate proof that S. pneumoniae is the most pathogenic among Mitis
ptococci. To reflect the theoretical possibility there might be a member of Mitis group with invasiveness
rier to disease case rate CCR) higher than S. pneumoniae we edited the text in line 54. With the
umococcus responsible for more morbidity and mortality around the world than all the other
ptococci of the Mitis group and since the pneumococcus is the most common etiological agent of
sive bacterial disease (2), we believe the statement in line 26 and repeated in line 54 is justified.
ine 35/88. The use of specific in this sentence gives the impression that lytA and piaB are in all
neumoniae. They are not as stated in the results – this should be noted as these genes cannot
sed as definitive markers which is what is the broader objective.
thank the reviewer for discussing this important point.
t, we would like to highlight that the positive results from the lytA and piaB-specific qPCRs for all tested
neumoniae strains would imply 100% sensitivity and not specificity but we understand the hesitation in
epting that either of the two is a definitive marker of S. pneumoniae.
ection of lytA in non-pneumococcal strains has indeed been reported in studies before the advent of
lytA-specific qPCR. Those were molecular assays targeting regions of the gene different to the one
eted in the qPCR we applied in this study. In the text, we stress that the sequence we targeted in lytA-
cific-qPCR was not detected in any non-pneumococcal strains tested in this study (100% specificity),
in paragraph starting line 415 that also in no samples previously tested by us and reported on
refore supporting high specificity) (3–7). As we have now highlighted further in the manuscript (lines
-422), there only exists one report of false positivity in this assay (8), despite how widespread its use is
oming. With the recent report of false positivity in the lytA assay from Portugal (8), the need for
iple targets to include for assurance of results is becoming more urgent.
are also not aware of any reports on false positivity of the piaB-specific assay although admittedly, the
ay is not broadly used. While piaB was therefore 100% specific, we have not claimed that it is 100%
sitive. In fact, since it does not detect non-typeable S. pneumoniae, it is not 100% sensitive.
ertheless, we are not aware of any target as specific as piaB to pair with lytA.
he discussion in general is very long and takes a number of liberties given the results. Lines
-325 – This section highlights that S2 species grouping is not uniform. I am concerned that the
ure of the limited geographical sampling used in this study may suggest that pneumococcal
ins may also show diversity if the genetic screen was larger. This should be at least discussed.
ed, it is evident that grouping even with WGS is not uniform or reliable, mostly due to the unreliable
cies annotation of sequences in the public databases. As we discuss (in paragraph starting line 364),
method of S2-typing further highlights the trouble in this, as also experienced by others. Therefore, we
e that S2-typing is most suited to streptococcal species and to S. pneumoniae identification when
r methods continue to struggle. We hope that the inclusion of over a thousand additional
umococcal strains alleviates the reviewer’s concerns in regards to the limited number of
umococcal strains we reported on in the original manuscript.
