This is an interesting review written by the main specialist of the field. I have only a very few
remarks to make:
1. The English of the MS should be improved. Especially in the first half of it there are many
grammatical inconsistencies.
2. P.3, l.4. It could be mentioned that the central C-fiber terminals of DRG neurons project to the
substantia gelatinosa (Layer II). Then interneurons project to the Layer I of the spinal cord.
3. Fig. Legends are missing. References to the Figs. should be made in the text.

This is a very interesting and timely review on the role of microglia in the development of
neuropathic pain, written by one of the pioneers in this field who significantly contributed (and
still contributes) to the shift from a “neuron-centric” view of neuropathic pain to a more
integrated approach. The concept of “microgliopathic” pain is extremely interesting as well, since
microglia can trigger pain itself, and could hopefully represent an innovative target for the
development of effective drugs.
Specific comments:
1. The paper would benefit from a careful proofreading due to several grammar and syntax
errors and to several unclear sentences. Indeed, in the two last paragraphs of section #6 the
statement “It was reported that…” is repeated at least 5 times in few lines; this makes the quite
repetitive. Just few examples of unclear and/or incorrect sentences:
- Summary:
o “…chronic pain is lacking the physiological significance but rather of confusion of nerve
functions”
- Introduction:
o “Neuropathic pain…is heavy clinical problem…”
o “Patients more than 20 million in the worldwide…”
o “…body of evidences [uncountable] showing that spinal microglia activated in response…”
- Section #4:
o “This report made a big stream as glial pain into the pain research.”
2. I would change the title of Section #5 since mechanisms of evoking mechanical allodynia have
been discussed also in the previous section. It could be changed to “Role of extracellular
nucleotides in mechanical allodynia” or something similar and more connected to the topic of the
section.
3. The reader is a bit confused by the background leading to Section #6 and to the development of
the concept of “MIcrogliopathic pain”. Maybe I got it wrong, but it is initially stated that this is
abnormal pain derived by activated microglia without nerve damage. Nevertheless, after the first
paragraph, the author discusses the mechanisms of microglia activation following PNI, which is a
type of nerve damage. Please, try to better clarify this point.
4. Figure legends are missing.

Dear The Open Biology Team
re: Manuscript RSOB-18-0154
Thank you for your decision letter of 03-Oct-2018. I am very pleased
that my manuscript is acceptable in principle and I have now revised the
manuscript according to referee comments.
As you will see in the attached revised manuscript and in my
point-by-point responses to referee comments, I have now addressed all
of these points.
I am now submitting a revised version of the review manuscript. I
appreciate very much your help and guidance with this manuscript.
Sincerely yours,

The point-by-point responses to referee comments

Comments to the Author(s)
Q1. The English of the MS should be improved. Especially in the first
half of it there are many grammatical inconsistencies.
A: I am very sorry for my poor English. I asked Trent Rogers, Ph.D.,
from Edanz Group (www.edanzediting.com/ac) for editing a draft of
this manuscript. I think the English has been improved.
Q2. P.3, l.4. It could be mentioned that the central C-fiber terminals of
DRG neurons project to the substantia gelatinosa (Layer II). Then
interneurons project to the Layer I of the spinal cord.
A: Thank you very much for your suggestion. As you mentioned,
C-fiber terminals of DRG neurons project to the substantia gelatinosa
(Layer II). And also there are reports indicating that C-fiber
terminals of DRG neurons project to Lamina I. Then, I use
“superficial layer” in the text as below because“superficial layer”
includes LamiaI and II. “These spikes conduct to the central ends of
these DRG neurons, and transmit to secondary sensory neurons in
the dorsal horn superficial layer” This change does not cause essential
misunderstandings.
3. Fig. Legends are missing. References to the Figs. should be made in
the text.
A: I am very sorry for my mistake that is very embarrassing. It was
completely dropped out in several corrective processes. I have
attached Fig.Legends in revised version.

Q2. I would change the title of Section #5 since mechanisms of evoking
mechanical allodynia have been discussed also in the previous section. It
could be changed to “Role of extracellular nucleotides in mechanical
allodynia” or something similar and more connected to the topic of the
section.
A: Thank you very much for your suggestion. Based on your remarks,
I have reviewed all titles including Section #5 and the title of the
paper. I changed the title of the paper from "A state-of-the-art
prospect of microgliopathic pain" to “A state-of-the-art perspective of
microgliopathic pain” as more appropriate. In Section #5, I firstly
mentioned the mechanism of evoking mechanical allodynia. In
previous section, I only mentioned the activation of microglia that
results in neuropathic pain but not the mechanism. Therefore, the
title of Section #5 seems to be appropriate as it is.
Q3. The reader is a bit confused by the background leading to Section #6
and to the development of the concept of “Microgliopathic pain”. Maybe I
got it wrong, but it is initially stated that this is abnormal pain derived
by activated microglia without nerve damage. Nevertheless, after the
first paragraph, the author discusses the mechanisms of microglia
activation following PNI, which is a type of nerve damage. Please, try to
better clarify this point.
A: Thank you very much for your suggestion. Based on your remarks,
I have changed several sentences in the text.
Before: “It has been reported that neuropathic pain is caused by
several treatments associated with activated microglia even in
normal animals [17,19,23-26].”
Revised text; Neuropathic pain is caused by several conditions after
PNI as mentioned before. Recently several reports indicated that
abnormal activated microglia are able to cause neuropathic pain even
in in naïve animals [17,19,23-26].
Q4. Figure legends are missing.
A: I am very sorry for my mistake that is very embarrassing. It was
completely dropped out in several corrective processes. I have
attached Fig.Legends in revised version.
