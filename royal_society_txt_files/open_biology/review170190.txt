This review of growth and size control starts of fairly generally but rapidly narrows to cover
tissue-autonomous organ size control and then focuses fairly tightly on Drosophila imaginal
discs. The coverage of the various alternative models that follows is nice, but their treatment is a
bit uneven, both in the text and in the figures. There is also an initial distinction made between
growth rate control and growth termination, and between permissive mechanisms and
instructive, but the authors seem to go back and forth rather unhelpfully between one category
and another. This should be tidied up to make a smoother and clearer read.
It seems highly likely that multiple mechanisms are used in combination, but this point is not
really made. Some synthesis of what combinations of mechanisms might be likely and effective
would be interesting. A big summary table would also be nice.

p.3, last paragraph “Given the complexity of the growth control mechanisms, it was important to
choose a simple model system to study the mechanism of growth control”. This is a rather
strange way of putting it. Should be “…it has been informative to choose…” or “… significant
insights have been gained by investigation of…”
p. 4, lines 7-8 “eversion, i.e. via the movement of the discs from the inside of the larvae, through
the larval wall…” should more precisely be “…eversion, i.e. via turning inside-out through the
larval wall…”
p.7, top “inconsistent with the observation that the growth of lateral clones with constitutively
active Dpp is faster than that of wild-type clones [42]. This is poorly explained: lateral clone
growth in constitutively Dpp-active tissue would seem to be consistent with the threshold model
if those clones would otherwise be non-growing.
p.8 Growth Equalisation model
It is not made clear here whether Dpp stimulates proliferation as well as pushing Brk to the
lateral parts of the tissue – the non-homogeneous proliferation is described as “inherent” which is
confusing.
p.9 Middle “Growth control by cell differentiation” is really growth control by clock-and-wave
patterning.
p.10, lines 4-5 “the growth data from the Drosophila wing disc cannot be explained with a
dilution mechanism [79].” This needs explaining.

p.10 Intercalation model: The arguments against the intercalation model are weak. The
nutritional limit is, as previously mentioned, a completely extrinsic mechanism and so likely of
only contingent relevance. The “considerable cell motility” is only very local – labelled clones
tend to remain as contiguous cells.
p.10 “Feed forward model” The description of this model seems to be of a different quality to that
of the other models, making them difficult to compare. Moreover, it is not really clearly
explained, and the speculation about wg involvement seems arbitrary and perhaps belonging to a
different model (e.g. the threshold model).

The manuscript by Vollmer et al. reviews the present state of knowledge concerning growth and
size control of Drosophila organs, particularly wind disc and eye disc, during development. This
is the very old but actually also a timely subject since significant new advances have been made
in the field during the last 5 years. The reviewer found the review to be basically informative to
general readers. However, as described below, the reviewer must point out that there are a
couple of things that the authors need to carefully and thoughtfully revise before publication.

(1) It is quite strange and surprising that the authors never discuss systemic mechanisms of

Nishimura, Alexander Shingleton, Douglas Emlen and Laura Lavine. Given that the authors
actually display the role of ecdysteroid in the organ growth in Figure 2C, the reviewer guesses
that the authors should have already understand the importance of such systemic regulatory
mechanisms. Thus, the authors must have at least one independent subsection to discuss this
important aspect for coordination of imaginal disc and body growth. Particularly, it seems to the
reviewer that the following two papers are important and should be included in the manuscript,
because Dr. Mirth studies the coordination of wing and whole-body development.

(2) The reviewer seriously asks the authors to improve Figure Legends, especially Figure 2, 4 and
5. The reviewer cannot find any necessary information to understand almost all of these figures.
In Figure 2, what do “S” and “P” represent in Figure 2F and 2G? What are c(t), x, and L(t) in
Figure 2I. What is the difference between dark green lines and light green lines in these figures?
The reviewer cannot find any information in Figure Legends to understand such jargons!
In Figure 4, what each number represents in Figure 4A? What do arrows represent in Figure 4B?
What are D, V and vg (the reviewer understands this point, but general readers would not)?
Although the authors mention that “For details see main text” in Figure Legend, there are no
detailed description to understand Figure 4 in main text.
In Figure 5, what do blue arrows represent? What is the weird blue substance in Figure 5B? What
is delta Pressure? What do “-0.3” and “0.5” represent?
3) The reviewer thinks that the authors can delete Figure 2D, which is almost meaningless.
4) Page 3: while the authors describe the morphological structure of wing discs in the section
“Drosophila imaginal discs as model system” on this page, the authors have already mentioned
the wing disc in the previous section “Robustness of size control”. Thus, it would be better that
the authors explain what wind discs are in the “Robustness…” section.

Appendix A
Dear OB-Team,
We would like to thank the reviewers for their comments and feedback on our
manuscript entitled "Growth and Size Control during Development". We provide
point-by-point responses below to all the issues raised. In the revised manuscript,
we have partially changed the introduction and therefore also the figures 1 & 2 to
address the reviewers’ comments. All changed text has been color-marked in the
manuscript files to facilitate the refereeing process.
In response to both referees, we have changed the text where they mentioned lack
of clarity.
In response to reviewer 1, we have added a discussion on the possibility of multiple
mechanisms being in place at the same time. The reviewer also suggested to include
a table, but we could not find a way to summarize our results in such a way as to be
of added value. We think that the new Figure 2 may serve this purpose.
We hope that in the revised manuscript we have now satisfactorily addressed the
issues raised by the reviewers.
With kind regards,
Dagmar Iber and Fernando Casares

Comments to the Author(s)
This review of growth and size control starts of fairly generally but rapidly narrows
to cover tissue-autonomous organ size control and then focuses fairly tightly on
Drosophila imaginal discs. The coverage of the various alternative models that
follows is nice, but their treatment is a bit uneven, both in the text and in the
figures. There is also an initial distinction made between growth rate control and
growth termination, and between permissive mechanisms and instructive, but the
authors seem to go back and forth rather unhelpfully between one category and
another. This should be tidied up to make a smoother and clearer read.
There are many ways in which one can think about growth control mechanisms.
Grouping them in permissive and instructive is one way that has been promoted in
recent years. This was particularly important in the context of Dpp-controlled growth
mechanisms. Recent experiments rule out such a key role of Dpp, and we therefore
believe that it is timely to adopt a new perspective on the problem.
We have tried to present the mechanisms in order of current relevance, starting with
those mechanisms that have been ruled out –but still are interesting for the way
they laid out seminal ideas- and finishing with those that still need to be further
tested, i.e. counting cell cycles, developmental time, morphogen-dependent control
(<U+F0E0> threshold, gradient, equalization, temporal dynamics), cell differentiation,
dilution, intercalation, tissue mechanics.
It seems highly likely that multiple mechanisms are used in combination, but this
point is not really made. Some synthesis of what combinations of mechanisms
might be likely and effective would be interesting. A big summary table would also
be nice.
We agree with the reviewer that multiple mechanisms may well work together and
we have added a comment to this effect in the conclusion paragraph. However, we
would rather not add speculations: the purpose of the review is to present the
current state of the field. Although we could not find a way to succinctly summarize
the mechanisms in a table that would be compact, we believe that the new Figure 2
(in combination with the Figures 3-5) may serve this synthetic role by summarizing
graphically all the discussed mechanisms.
Specific comments:
p. 3 Organ-size independence of ploidy-driven cell size should include
Henery CC, Bard JB, Kaufman MH. Tetraploidy in mice, embryonic cell number,
and the grain of the developmental map. Dev Biol. 1992 Aug;152(2):233-41.
PubMed PMID: 1644218.
We have included the reference and changed the text accordingly.
p.3, last paragraph “Given the complexity of the growth control mechanisms, it
was important to choose a simple model system to study the mechanism of
growth control”. This is a rather strange way of putting it. Should be “…it has been
informative to choose…” or “… significant insights have been gained by
investigation of…”
We have changed the text and hope that it reads better now.
p. 4, lines 7-8 “eversion, i.e. via the movement of the discs from the inside of the
larvae, through the larval wall…” should more precisely be “…eversion, i.e. via
turning inside-out through the larval wall…”
We have changed the text accordingly.
p.7, top “inconsistent with the observation that the growth of lateral clones with
constitutively active Dpp is faster than that of wild-type clones [42]. This is poorly
explained: lateral clone growth in constitutively Dpp-active tissue would seem to
be consistent with the threshold model if those clones would otherwise be non-
growing.
We have changed the text and hope that the reasoning has become clearer.
p.8 Growth Equalisation model
It is not made clear here whether Dpp stimulates proliferation as well as pushing
Brk to the lateral parts of the tissue – the non-homogeneous proliferation is
described as “inherent” which is confusing.
We have changed the text to make this clearer.
p.9 Middle “Growth control by cell differentiation” is really growth control by
clock-and-wave patterning.
The advancement of the morphogenetic furrow in the eye disc can indeed be
understood as a travelling wave. However, we do not think it is a clock. A clock-and-
wave mechanism has been proposed in the context of somitogenesis where
oscillations in different pathways have been observed experimentally. We are not
aware of such observations in the Drosophila eye disc.
However, in the context of growth control, the relevant part is not so much the
mode of propagation of the differentiation front, but rather cell differentiation itself.
Cell differentiation has been suggested to terminate growth in many contexts. The
wave-like propagation of the differentiation wave in the eye disc made it particularly
accessible to experimental analysis. And the important conclusion from the eye disc
is that, independent of the differentiation process, the growth rate declines in the
undifferentiated cells. Differentiation alone is thus not sufficient to explain the
decline in the growth rate and ultimate growth termination.
p.10, lines 4-5 “the growth data from the Drosophila wing disc cannot be explained
with a dilution mechanism [79].” This needs explaining.
The growth data from the wing disc follow growth kinetics that cannot be matched
by the dilution mechanism.
p.10 Intercalation model: The arguments against the intercalation model are weak.
The nutritional limit is, as previously mentioned, a completely extrinsic mechanism
and so likely of only contingent relevance. The “considerable cell motility” is only
very local – labelled clones tend to remain as contiguous cells.
We did not mean to argue against the intercalation model, but rather highlight open
questions that still need to be addressed experimentally. We hope we now make this
clearer by adding the following paragraph to the text:
To permit a direct experimental confirmation of an intercalation mechanism in
organ/appendage size control, the molecular details of the postulated cell identity
gradient need to be defined. Here, it will be important to understand how a cell
identity gradient can be established and read reliably across a large developmental
field, as well as the cross-talk with extrinsic size control, i.e. how the positional
identity would scale when embryonic structures grow to different finite sizes, for
instance because of differences in available nutrients.
p.10 “Feed forward model” The description of this model seems to be of a
different quality to that of the other models, making them difficult to compare.
Moreover, it is not really clearly explained, and the speculation about wg
involvement seems arbitrary and perhaps belonging to a different model (e.g. the
threshold model).
The feed-forward model is complex and we have tried to explain as plainly as
possible (now introducing a few changes in the text to make it clearer) –but would
be grateful if the reviewer could help us in finding a better wording. While the
referee maybe right in saying that our hypothesis on Wg’s role in this model as a
potential terminator of growth might belong into the threshold category, we wanted
to present it here as a follow-up on the feed-forward model. The major role played
by Wg in this model, together with the reviewed recent advances made on its way of
action (dynamic patterns rather than morphogen dispersion), in our opinion makes
the choice of Wg not arbitrary, but almost unavoidable.
p.11, line 12 “tipping off towards” should be “tapering off towards”?
We have changed the text accordingly.
p.11, line 15 “(i.e. fast from the disc’s center)” should be “far from the disc’s
center”
We have changed the text accordingly.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Vollmer et al. reviews the present state of knowledge
concerning growth and size control of Drosophila organs, particularly wind disc and
eye disc, during development. This is the very old but actually also a timely subject
since significant new advances have been made in the field during the last 5 years.
The reviewer found the review to be basically informative to general readers.
However, as described below, the reviewer must point out that there are a couple
of things that the authors need to carefully and thoughtfully revise before
publication.
(1) It is quite strange and surprising that the authors never discuss systemic
mechanisms of growth and size control during development. It is obvious that
some systemic/humoral factors, including insulin-like peptides (ILPs) and
ecdysteroids, and their signaling pathways play crucial roles in regulating organ
and body growth. A part of the researchers who have recently contributed to this
issue are Drs. Pierre Léopold, Christen Mirth, Takashi Koyama, Takashi Nishimura,
Alexander Shingleton, Douglas Emlen and Laura Lavine. Given that the authors
actually display the role of ecdysteroid in the organ growth in Figure 2C, the
reviewer guesses that the authors should have already understand the importance
of such systemic regulatory mechanisms. Thus, the authors must have at least one
independent subsection to discuss this important aspect for coordination of
imaginal disc and body growth. Particularly, it seems to the reviewer that the
following two papers are important and should be included in the manuscript,
because Dr. Mirth studies the coordination of wing and whole-body development.
Oliveira MM, Shingleton AW, Mirth CK (2014) Coordination of wing and whole-
body development at developmental milestones ensures robustness against
environmental and physiological perturbations. PLoS Genet. 2014 Jun 19;10(6):
e1004408

post-critical weight switch to nutrition-independent differentiation in Drosophila
wing imaginal discs. Development 2009 136: 2345-2353
We are not only very aware of this work, but we recognize its major importance in
having identified mechanisms linking hormonal and extrinsic factors with organ
growth control, and ensuring coordinated growth of organs with developmental
timing and whole body size. However, we wanted to focus in this review on a very
particular aspect, for which a number of detailed tissue-level molecular and
biophysical models had been proposed -organ intrinsic mechanisms of growth
termination. We make this now clearer by adding the following paragraph at the end
of the Introduction:
In summary, organ growth is controlled by both organ-intrinsic and organ-extrinsic
mechanism and the relative contributions of the control mechanisms differ between
organs. In this review, we will focus on the intrinsic mechanisms that ensure organ
growth termination. Readers interested in organ-extrinsic mechanisms should refer
to existing reviews in the field.
The integration between the whole body scale and this organ intrinsic control is
essential and the work on the former aspect by the scientists the reviewer mentions
is foundational. However, reviewing these aspects were not the aim of the review
and doing so would have occupied a prohibitive extension, if it had to be done with
sufficient depth.
(2) The reviewer seriously asks the authors to improve Figure Legends, especially
Figure 2, 4 and 5. The reviewer cannot find any necessary information to
understand almost all of these figures.
In Figure 2, what do “S” and “P” represent in Figure 2F and 2G? What are c(t), x,
and L(t) in Figure 2I. What is the difference between dark green lines and light
green lines in these figures? The reviewer cannot find any information in Figure
Legends to understand such jargons!
In Figure 4, what each number represents in Figure 4A? What do arrows represent
in Figure 4B? What are D, V and vg (the reviewer understands this point, but
general readers would not)? Although the authors mention that “For details see
main text” in Figure Legend, there are no detailed description to understand Figure
4 in main text.
In Figure 5, what do blue arrows represent? What is the weird blue substance in
Figure 5B? What is delta Pressure? What do “-0.3” and “0.5” represent?
We are sorry for our poor figure legends. In the revised manuscript, we have
changed them substantially.
3) The reviewer thinks that the authors can delete Figure 2D, which is almost
meaningless.
We agree and have removed the panel from our new figure 2.
4) Page 3: while the authors describe the morphological structure of wing discs in
the section “Drosophila imaginal discs as model system” on this page, the authors
have already mentioned the wing disc in the previous section “Robustness of size
control”. Thus, it would be better that the authors explain what wind discs are in
the “Robustness…” section.
We have removed the paragraph on Robustness and we have re-arranged the text to
avoid this problem.
