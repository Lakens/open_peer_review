Nakamura and colleagues discuss the mechanisms by which cells repair damage to their plasma
membrane. The introduction does an excellent job at setting up the biological question, the steps
that a cell needs to follow to repair damage, and the current status of the field. The authors go on
to describe the potential signals that may trigger wound repair in cells, including calcium influx
and changes in membrane potential, oxidation, changes in membrane tension, or trancriptional
activity. Membrane resealing mechanisms are discussed, including membrane patching,
exocytosis/endocytosis, and changes in membrane tension or lipid composition to recruit the cell
repair machinery. Potential roles of dysferlin as a scaffolding protein and annexins as linkers
between the membrane and the cytoskeleton are described. The authors review the dynamics of
actin and myosin in different models of cell wound, and how cytoskeletal proteins are patterned
by Rho-family GTPases during cell repair. They discuss the role of myosin activity, and how
myosin is important in some systems but not in others, thus introducing the concepts of actin ring
translocation (through treadmilling) and contraction (through motor activity). The authors
highlight the importance of the study of single cell wound repair to better understand Rho
GTPase regulation and patterning, actin network contraction, plasma membrane dynamics, and
human disease. In concluding, some of the outstanding questions in the field are described,
including the importance of the wounding insult, whether single cell repair occurs similarly in
the context of other cells (rather than in an isolated cell), and the interplay between physical and
molecular mechanisms of cell repair.
This is an excellent review, comprehensive, clearly written, and nicely illustrated with figures. I
just have a couple of questions that I think the authors should clarify, and a couple of minor
"stylistic" points:
1. I did not understand why endocytosis is limited in its ability to reseal the membrane (lines 254-
256), while membrane patching is not. Is there any experimental evidence for that? Without
knowing what is the membrane source for the patching mechanism (as indicated by the authors,
lines 230-233) can we assume that the membrane patching mechanism may not be limited as
well?
2. Line 407-410: the authors describe how actin stabilization in myosin-motor-mutant yeast cells
slows down cytokinesis, but they should also discuss if the mutants displays slower cytokinesis
than the wild type when actin dynamics are normal, to understand if myosin motor activity
contributes at all to the contraction of these cytokinetic rings.
3. Figure 1a is never referenced from the text. Maybe combine a reference to figure 1a-b (e.g. line
62)?
4. Line 164: substitute "absence" by "inhibition"?
5. Line 354: should there be a comma after "states"?

We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311

MS TITLE: Into the breach: How cells cope with wounds
AUTHORS: M Nakamura, AMN Dominguez, JR Decker, AJ Hull, JM
Verboon, and SM Parkhurst
1. I did not understand why endocytosis is limited in its ability to reseal the
membrane (lines 254-256), while membrane patching is not. Is there any
experimental evidence for that? Without knowing what is the membrane
source for the patching mechanism (as indicated by the authors, lines 230-
233) can we assume that the membrane patching mechanism may not be
limited as well?
The point of the Reviewer is well made. It was not our intention to suggest
that membrane patching is a process without size constraints or
limitations. Further study is required to find the structural limitations for this
mechanisms. The text has been amended to make this point clearer.
2. Line 407-410: the authors describe how actin stabilization in myosin-motor-
mutant yeast cells slows down cytokinesis, but they should also discuss if the
mutants displays slower cytokinesis than the wild type when actin dynamics
are normal, to understand if myosin motor activity contributes at all to the
contraction of these cytokinetic rings.
Myo1 yeast strains do show significantly decreased cytokinesis kinetics, as
shown by Mendes Pinto and colleagues (2012). Furthermore, the addition
of jasplakinolide in this Myo1 mutant background displays an additive
phenotype, and the rate of closure is further decreased or in some cases
abolished completely. Thus, both Myosin motor activity and actin
depolymerization are independent processes that are both required for
proper cytokinesis. We have amended the text to clarify this point.
3. Figure 1a is never referenced from the text. Maybe combine a reference to
figure 1a-b (e.g. line 62)?
We now refer to Figure 1a in the text.
4. Line 164: substitute "absence" by "inhibition"?
This substitution has been made.
5. Line 354: should there be a comma after "states"?
Yes – the text has been amended.
