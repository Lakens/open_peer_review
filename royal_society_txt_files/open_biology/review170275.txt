This is an interesting article which I found helpful in considering some of the complexities arising
from variation between different ATP sythases.
Points:
1. Title not really suitable; What are ‘mechanistic features? Mechansim of inhibition?
2. Abstract: first line is wrong obligate anaerobes do not make ATP this way
3. Intro: line 3 ‘almost all kingdoms of life’ Meaning? There are only three and archaea do not
contain the F- type

the P side of the membrane
5. Page 4 and 5: I was left confused as to whether p denitrificans has an epsilon subunit of similar
sequence/structure/ If it does then what does it do if the zeta subunits is meant to be the
inhibitor?

The presented review on Insights into the mechanistic features of the epsilon subunit from
bacterial F-type ATP synthases represent very much needed summary of the latest data involving
the epsilon- mediated ATP hydrolysis regulation in bacteria.
I have to acknowledge the complexity and the deepness of the review and the authors´s profound
knowledge of the topic. But maybe because of this, the review seems to be targeted to experts in
the field, but not to the general scientific public. I must say that the review is quite difficult to
read and the reader´s attention is often lost by presenting too many details without an obvious
importance and link to the discussed topics.
The structure of the review is good starting with description of different biophysical and
biochemical experiments done in individual species that led to a conclusion that subunit epsilon
is capable of two different conformations. But then the review is taking a different angle
discussing the structural evidence of the different epsilon conformations by comparing all the
individual species with each other at once (I like this section better). However because of this
structure, some sections contain overlap
ATP, see below) and authors should try to clearly distinguish what is discussed where.
What makes the review so difficult to read is the structure of the paragraphs. There are no topic
sentences. Very often the reader finds out the reason for numerous detailed statements at the end
of the paragraph/chapter. Some paragraphs are extremely long (e.g. the whole section on C.
thermarum TA2.A1 is one paragraph expanding to 3 pages!!). Factual sentences are just stated
without obvious connection to the previous sentence and without understandable meaning to
comprehend the focus of the paragraph (if there is a focus). I would highly recommend to the
authors to ask somebody at their departments (outside of the ATP synthase field) for a feedback.
The text should be rewritten substantially and adjusted for a broader scientific community.
Main points:
Abstract:
Line 32: “ATP synthases catalyze the formation of chemical energy in all living cells, ATP.”
- This sentence is misleading as ATP synthases do not catalyze formation of ATP in all living
cells. Examples are found within the eukaryotic group of Metamonads as these protists possess
hydrogenosomes or mitosomes and they are incapable of performing oxidative phosphorylation.
Line 37: “Additionally, e subunit inhibition has also been described in two bacterial systems.”
- I suppose that authors mean E. coli and Bacillus PS3. I would spell these two species out
making the sentence more exact.
4
Line 38: Previous studies suggest that the e subunit is capable of undergoing an ATP-dependent
conformational change from the ATP hydrolytic inhibitory ‘extended’ conformation, to the non-
inhibitory ‘hairpin’ conformation.
– In order to appreciate the information in the following sentence regarding the C. thermarum
TA2.A1 I would suggest to mention that ATP induces the hairpin, contracted, ATP-bound
conformation.
Lines 39-41
“Recently, a refined crystal structure of the F1 domain from the Caldalkalibacillus thermarum
TA2.A1 F1Fo ATP synthase revealed the epsilon subunit in a hairpin conformation in the absence
of ATP.”
– If I understand the topic well, this conformation was observed using an epsilon mutant (see
lines 107-108), while the wt epsilon subunit was found in the contracted hairpin conformation in
the presence of ATP similarly what was observed in other bacterial species. If that is correct, the
sentence should be written in more exact sense as otherwise it might be confusing to the reader.
Lines 74 – 76 “Recent structural data in the extended [12] and contracted/hairpin conformation
[27] support the interpretation of these biochemical experiments [26].
– This sentence here is out of blue, the extended and contracted/hairpin conformations were not
properly introduced yet, I have no idea what biochemical experiments the authors mean. Please,
put it into the context, or delete it.
Lines 81 – 83 The CTD has been frequently described having a dynamic nature, with the ability to
change conformation depending on the presence or absence of various concentrations of ATP[30–
33].
– For better understanding it should be clearly spell out that ATP induces the contracted hairpin
conformation.
Lines 89 – 90 “….. the hairpin and extended conformations are frequently referred to as the
‘inhibitory’ and ‘non-inhibitory’ states in literature, respectively
– it is the other way around, the hairpin is the non-inhibitory, extended conformation is the
inhibitory one
Lines 91 – 92 “To our knowledge, the first suggestion that the e subunit inhibits ATP hydrolysis
in an in vivo setting was described in the Escherichia coli F1 (EF1) domain [40].”
– Why this sentence is here? I expected a follow up on this statement, but authors discuss further
the conformations suggesting that it is prudent to simply refer to them by their shape. Sadly, they
do not offer solution how to refer to them.
Section between lines 96 – 127 starting with “Structural data for isolated………”
The most difficult section to read so far. It contains a lot of details of different mutants of different
organisms. I am sure that you can find place later in the text for all this information. Plus this
section contains unexplained terms (e.g. half-extended..). No topic sentences!
Line 98 – “ Interestingly, a recent NMR data…..”
Why it is interesting? Spell it out.
Lines 106 - 108
“However, the F1 crystal structure from Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 shows the
contracted hairpin conformation when being bound to ATP (wild type) and for the
eD89A/R92A mutant, which lacks the ability to bind ATP [43].
- In regards what is written in the abstract, this statement is confusing. I guess what is
5
interesting is that the TA2.A1 structure shows only the hairpin conformation regardless the
ATP… if yes, it should be spell out
Lines 111 –
What is the focus of this paragraph? Please introduce topic sentence
Line 115 – it should read “In the case of M. bovis…”
Line 117 – which mycobacteria – all of them ?
Lines 122 – 126 – this information about the apparent binding constant will be discussed again on
page 13, here I don’t see any reason why to mention them, please delete it.
162 – unlikely ?
168 – the abbreviation is introduced later (line 178), please move it here
Section on C. thermarumTA2.A1 – please divide the section into several paragraphs, introduce
topic of each paragraph, simplify the conclusions (e.g. that Mg ions affect the ATP hydrolysis
measurements), focus only on important mutations (e.g. R123 and R127)
Lines 380 – 381 -…… we cannot discount the ATP hydrolysis observed with the gamma…..
- I don’t understand the importance, please introduce the mutant and spell out the significance.

Board Member Comments to Author(s):
If the authors were willing to make the review more readable to specialist and general readers (as
well as address the reviewers' more straightforward concerns), then my recommendation would
be to publish in the journal. I think the re-write falls under the category of a major (but
straightforward) revision. When I read the manuscript prior to recommending expert peer
review, I felt the discussion was likely to be less accessible than it should be.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author(s):
Referee: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting article which I found helpful in considering some of the
complexities arising from variation between different ATP sythases.
Points:
1. Title not really suitable; What are ‘mechanistic features? Mechansim of inhibition?
A: We wished to convey the notion that there is a dynamic movement of the epsilon
movement. Upon reflection, and this comment, we have altered the title by replacing the
words ‘mechanistic features’ with ‘regulatory function’ to fit in with the broader concept
of the review.
2. Abstract: first line is wrong obligate anaerobes do not make ATP this way
A: Thus far the comment quite correct (to my knowledge) in so far as current
observations have shown. We have addressed the comment: ‘ATP synthases catalyze the
formation of ATP, the chemical energy storage unit found in all living cells.’
3. Intro: line 3 ‘almost all kingdoms of life’ Meaning? There are only three and
archaea do not contain the F- type
A: To be honest we are politically ‘fence sitting’ on the virus ‘being alive’ matter.
Regarding the 3 strictly defined kingdoms, the statement is quite accurate since we do not
specifically mention the F-type ATP synthase, just ‘ATP synthases’.
4. Line 68: Not all bacteria have a periplasm. Could rephrase …into the periplasm or
in general to the P side of the membrane
A: To be more inclusive of a broader readership we have changed the statement to read
‘-into the periplasm or in general, the P-side of the membrane’. However, we disagree on
the statement that ‘not all bacteria have a periplasm’ because in some gram positives it
has simply been shown to be a very small (Zuber et al, J.Bac, DOI: 10.1128/JB.00391-
06). I expect with further developments in microscopy we may find this to be more
common than we have previously observed.
5. Page 4 and 5: I was left confused as to whether p denitrificans has an epsilon
subunit of similar sequence/structure/ If it does then what does it do if the zeta subunits is
meant to be the inhibitor?
A: We state on lines 107-110 (I have bolded the parts of the sentence regarding
Paracoccus).
‘Lastly, if the structural data comprises the whole F1 domain, the e subunit has also
been found in either the extended or hairpin conformation, as shown for the crystal
structure of the F1 domain from Bacillus PS3, Paracoccus denitrificans, the crystal (F1)
and EM (F1Fo) structures from E. coli.’
So yes, P. denitrificans indeed has an epsilon subunit, but was found in the hairpin
conformation. It lacks the proposed ‘ATP binding site’ identified in other organisms, thus
has been proposed to not be involved in regulation. However, we are not so bold as to
dismiss a potential role since detailed studies in a variety of conditions have not yet been
sufficiently addressed. This is one of the many reasons why we come to the conclusion
that the epsilon subunit, may be an ‘emergency break’ or a ‘latch’ to prevent wasteful
ATP hydrolysis – or conversely, enhance synthesis. Unfortunately, the jury is still very
much out on this thus far – we have much work to do to unravel this, but unfortunately the
focus has all been on the zeta subunit and people are ignoring the basic descriptions in
favour of the ‘current hot topic’.
6. The detailed structural points in the bulk of the paper seem a fair basis for the
analysis the authors wish to do. Whether ii is all too speculative I cannot judge
A: This is a fair point, we totally agree with this reviewers comment. Too often the
structure has trumped the function in terms of understanding when the combination of
both tells the story. This is one of the very reasons we wrote this article. The authors here
do not all agree on any one point – so we have attempted to present a balanced
viewpoint. We wish to inform that there is still much to do, and nothing is certain as yet –
we have snapshots at this point and the gaps need to be filled to come to meaningful
conclusions. However, what we do know is that epsilon subunit regulation is a bacterial
phenomenon, and looks to be tuned to organisms requirements, making it potentially a
very good drug target and worthy or future study.

Comments to the Author(s)
The presented review on Insights into the mechanistic features of the epsilon subunit from
bacterial F-type ATP synthases represent very much needed summary of the latest data
involving the epsilon- mediated ATP hydrolysis regulation in bacteria.
I have to acknowledge the complexity and the deepness of the review and the authors´s
profound knowledge of the topic. But maybe because of this, the review seems to be
targeted to experts in the field, but not to the general scientific public. I must say that the
review is quite difficult to read and the reader´s attention is often lost by presenting too
many details without an obvious importance and link to the discussed topics.
The structure of the review is good starting with description of different biophysical and
biochemical experiments done in individual species that led to a conclusion that subunit
epsilon is capable of two different conformations. But then the review is taking a
different angle discussing the structural evidence of the different epsilon conformations
by comparing all the individual species with each other at once (I like this section better).
However because of this structure, some sections contain overlapping information (e.g.
section on binding constant of <U+F065> to ATP, see below) and authors should try to clearly
distinguish what is discussed where.
What makes the review so difficult to read is the structure of the paragraphs. There are no
topic sentences. Very often the reader finds out the reason for numerous detailed
statements at the end of the paragraph/chapter. Some paragraphs are extremely long (e.g.
the whole section on C. thermarum TA2.A1 is one paragraph expanding to 3 pages!!).
Factual sentences are just stated without obvious connection to the previous sentence and
without understandable meaning to comprehend the focus of the paragraph (if there is a
focus). I would highly recommend to the authors to ask somebody at their departments
(outside of the ATP synthase field) for a feedback. The text should be rewritten
substantially and adjusted for a broader scientific community.
A: Substantial effort has been put into making this, rather complex review, into several
fields more accessible. Also, focus has been brought about by the use of topic sentences.
The issue with this area is that it impacts upon all cellular bioenergetics, but the methods
of analysis are very much confined to ‘focussed groups’.
The interrelated nature of this topic have precluded the general scientific public
from understanding what we currently know. So while cross-referencing between the two
sections still occurs, we have pulled the sections together more discretely:
1. Biochemical/Biophysical evidence
- then organism by organism
2. Structural Comparison
- then organism by organism
Due to the importance of regulating this enzyme, and the implications of regulation,
we believe the adjusted 3rd section: Conclusions and the 6th Antibiotic Target Space,
opens the topic to a wider audience. We have also injected referrals to the importance of
targeting the epsilon subunit as a drug target throughout the manuscript, from the
introduction to the conclusive section of the manuscript. However, we are wary of
broadening the topic to too much simplicity because we want to discourage surface-
skimming readers whom can so easily misinterpret the complexity of this enzymes
regulation.
Main points:
Abstract:
Line 32: “ATP synthases catalyze the formation of chemical energy in all living cells,
ATP.”
- This sentence is misleading as ATP synthases do not catalyze formation of ATP in all
living cells. Examples are found within the eukaryotic group of Metamonads as these
protists possess hydrogenosomes or mitosomes and they are incapable of performing
oxidative phosphorylation.
A: This is a fair statement, we have replaced it with the following: ‘ATP synthases
catalyze the formation of ATP, the chemical energy storage unit found in all living cells.’
Line 37: “Additionally, e subunit inhibition has also been described in two bacterial
systems.”
- I suppose that authors mean E. coli and Bacillus PS3. I would spell these two species
out making the sentence more exact.
A: This is a fair comment, we have altered the statement to be more exacting:
‘Additionally, e subunit inhibition has also been described in three bacterial systems,
Escherichia coli, Bacillus PS3 and Caldalkalibacills thermarum TA2.A1.’
Line 38: Previous studies suggest that the e subunit is capable of undergoing an ATP-
dependent conformational change from the ATP hydrolytic inhibitory ‘extended’
conformation, to the non-inhibitory ‘hairpin’ conformation.
– In order to appreciate the information in the following sentence regarding the C.
thermarum TA2.A1 I would suggest to mention that ATP induces the hairpin, contracted,
ATP-bound conformation.
A: We thank the reviewer for the comment; we have altered the sentence to include ‘ATP
induced’. It now reads: ‘Previous studies suggest that the e subunit is capable of
undergoing an ATP-dependent conformational change from the ATP hydrolytic inhibitory
‘extended’ conformation, to the ATP-induced non-inhibitory ‘hairpin’ conformation.’
Lines 39-41
“Recently, a refined crystal structure of the F1 domain from the Caldalkalibacillus
thermarum TA2.A1 F1Fo ATP synthase revealed the epsilon subunit in a hairpin
conformation in the absence of ATP.”
– if I understand the topic well, this conformation was observed using an epsilon mutant
(see lines 107-108), while the wt epsilon subunit was found in the contracted hairpin
conformation in the presence of ATP similarly what was observed in other bacterial
species. If that is correct, the sentence should be written in more exact sense as otherwise
it might be confusing to the reader.
A: We have refined the sentence to: “Recently, a refined crystal structure of the F1
domain from the Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 F1Fo ATP synthase revealed that
a mutant e subunit, lacking the ability to bind ATP, in a hairpin conformation”. We have
also started a new paragraph to create a ‘pause’ for the reader to fully digest the
implications of this recent finding in context of what was stated in the previous
paragraph.
Lines 74 – 76 “Recent structural data in the extended [12] and contracted/hairpin
conformation [27] support the interpretation of these biochemical experiments [26].
– This sentence here is out of blue, the extended and contracted/hairpin conformations
were not properly introduced yet, I have no idea what biochemical experiments the
authors mean. Please, put it into the context, or delete it.
A: The reviewer is quite correct; we discuss the conformational states in the subsequent
paragraph. Given that this is the case, we have deleted the offending sentence.
Lines 81 – 83 The CTD has been frequently described having a dynamic nature, with the
ability to change conformation depending on the presence or absence of various
concentrations of ATP[30–33].
– For better understanding it should be clearly spell out that ATP induces the contracted
hairpin conformation.
A: Fair comment, our statement was less exacting than it could have been. We have now
modified the following sentence to read “When these two helices are parallel (i.e. in a
‘down-state’) both spatially localized to the rigid ß-sheet domain and the e subunit is
described to be in the contracted ‘hairpin conformation’, a state which is induced by
ATP binding [29,34–37]”
Lines 89 – 90 “….. the hairpin and extended conformations are frequently referred to as
the ‘inhibitory’ and ‘non-inhibitory’ states in literature, respectively
– it is the other way around, the hairpin is the non-inhibitory, extended conformation is
the inhibitory one
A: Thank you for the accurate observation. We have reversed this to suit by reversing the
order of referral. ‘….the extended and hairpin…’
Lines 91 – 92 “To our knowledge, the first suggestion that the e subunit inhibits ATP
hydrolysis in an in vivo setting was described in the Escherichia coli F1 (EF1) domain
[40].”
– Why this sentence is here? I expected a follow up on this statement, but authors discuss
further the conformations suggesting that it is prudent to simply refer to them by their
shape. Sadly, they do not offer solution how to refer to them.
A: We have deleted the sentence from this place in the manuscript and moved it to where
it is far more appropriate – the start of the biochemical section referring to Escherichia
coli.
Section between lines 96 – 127 starting with “Structural data for isolated………”
The most difficult section to read so far. It contains a lot of details of different mutants of
different organisms. I am sure that you can find place later in the text for all this
information. Plus this section contains unexplained terms (e.g. half-extended..). No topic
sentences!
A: We have considered this comment very carefully and completely rewritten this section
to create focussed topic sentences.
Line 98 – “ Interestingly, a recent NMR data…..”
Why it is interesting? Spell it out.
A: This comment is no longer applicable as it has been re-written. ‘Interestingly’ was an
inappropriate term to use in light of the paragraph development.
Lines 106 - 108
“However, the F1 crystal structure from Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 shows the
contracted hairpin conformation when being bound to ATP (wild type) and for the
eD89A/R92A mutant, which lacks the ability to bind ATP [43].
- In regards what is written in the abstract, this statement is confusing. I guess what is
interesting is that the TA2.A1 structure shows only the hairpin conformation regardless
the ATP… if yes, it should be spell out
A: Yes, it is confusing because its location in the text of the manuscript was
inappropriate. We have removed the overlap in information. It is better addressed in the
Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 sections with regards to the eD89A/R92A mutant.
Lines 111 –
What is the focus of this paragraph? Please introduce topic sentence
A: This comment is no longer applicable as it has been re-written.
Line 115 – it should read “In the case of M. bovis…”
A: This comment is no longer applicable as it has been re-written.
Line 117 – which mycobacteria – all of them ?
A: This comment is no longer applicable as it has been re-written.
Lines 122 – 126 – this information about the apparent binding constant will be discussed
again on page 13, here I don’t see any reason why to mention them, please delete it.
A: Quite correct, we have simply restructured this section of text to refer to the broad
range of affinities so that we can become more specific later in the article.
Line 162 – unlikely ?
A: This comment is no longer applicable as it has been re-written.
Line 168 – the abbreviation is introduced later (line 178), please move it here
A: This comment is no longer applicable as it has been re-written.
Section on C. thermarum TA2.A1 – please divide the section into several paragraphs,
introduce topic of each paragraph, simplify the conclusions (e.g. that Mg ions affect the
ATP hydrolysis measurements), focus only on important mutations (e.g. R123 and R127)
A: We have modified this section significantly. However, unfortunately, all the mutations
have significant roles at this point. Residues influencing ATP binding can subtly shift in
primary sequence location between organisms, so we must be absolutely conservative
and keep away from trying to trend these features overly much. There is too much in
terms of ‘organism-specific’ and ‘conditional specific’ results in current literature, makes
it too hard to follow for non-experts. Case and point, the new E.coli F1Fo cryoEM
structure has the epsilon subunit in the extended conformation (Sobti et al; ref 16 in
manuscript).) and the recent C. thermarum TA2.A1 crystal structure in the hairpin
conformation (Ferguson et al; ref 45 in manuscript).
Lines 380 – 381 -…… we cannot discount the ATP hydrolysis observed with the
gamma…..
- I don’t understand the importance, please introduce the mutant and spell out the
significance.
A: Quite right, fair comment. We were being purposefully coy here, perhaps too much in
the interests of clarity. The McMillan lab is preparing a manuscript on the topic.
However, in the interests of clarifying this in the present manuscript, we have modified
the paragraph to read:
‘Lastly, while the focus of this review is on e subunit regulation, it should be mentioned
about the potential role of the <U+03B3> subunit in ATP hydrolysis regulation in TA2F1. A
mutation changing 8KRRIR12 residues in the <U+03B3> subunit of TA2F1 to 8QQQIQ12 residues
(TA2F1<U+03B3>Q4) resulted in a similarly partially active hydrolytic enzyme with similar ATP
hydrolysis kinetics as the TA2F1 <U+0394>e6A mutant previously mentioned, the reasons for this
are currently under close scrutiny (Knobel et al in preparation).

33 Abstract
34 ATP synthases catalyze the formation of ATP, the most common chemical energy
35 storage unit found in all living cells, ATP. These enzymes are driven by an electrochemical ion
36 gradient, which allows the catalytic evolution of ATP by a binding change mechanism. Most
37 ATP synthases are capable of catalyzing ATP hydrolysis to varying degrees and t. To prevent
38 wasteful ATP hydrolysis, bacteria and mitochondria have regulatory mechanisms such as ADP
39 inhibition. Additionally, e subunit inhibition has also been described in threewo bacterial
40 systems, Escherichia coli, Bacillus PS3 and Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1. Previous Formatted: Font: Italic

56 Introduction
57 All organisms require ATP, the a universal chemical energy sourcestorage unit, to carry
58 out and maintain cellular functions. - ATP is crucial for the survival and maintenance of all
59 living cells. ATP synthases are found in almost all kingdoms of life and are the main ATP
60 synthesiszing enzymatic machineries in aerobically growing cells. Recently, the F-type ATP Formatted: Font: (Default) Times New Roman, 12 pt

68 membrane embedded Fo domain [5]. Notably, the e subunit of bacteria is the d subunit in Formatted: Not Highlight
69 mitochondria, but with a divergent function [5]. The membrane-bound Fo domain harbors a c- Formatted: Not Highlight
70 ring, where the number of c subunits varies from 8 to 15 among different organisms, yet remains
71 invariant within individual organisms [63–107], the a subunit, which is horizontally aligned to
72 the c-ring [118,129], and the dimeric b2 subunit [130]. The b2 dimer forms a peripheral stalk,
73 connecting the Fo domain with the a3ß3 catalytic hexamer via the d subunit in bacteria [141–163],
74 orr subunit the oligomycin sensitive conferral protein (OSCP) subunit in mitochondrial ATP
75 synthases [118,129,174,185]. A proton- or sodium-motive force drives the rotation of the
76 membrane embedded c-ring [196] versus the membrane embedded stator subunits a and b2
77 [118,129]. The transported ion is dependent on the selectivity of the binding site structure in the
78 c-ring [1720]. In the ATP synthesis direction of c-ring rotation (clockwise), a single revolution of
4
79 the c-ring causes a single revolution of the <U+03B3> subunit, which, in turn, induces conformational
80 changes in all three aß subunits. The net result of this rotation is the catalysis of 3 ADP and 3
81 inorganic phosphate molecules (Pi) into 3 ATP molecules [1821] coupled to the translocation of
82 either H+ or Na+ across the cytoplasmic membrane [1922]. In addition, this enzymatic reaction
83 can be driven in the reverse direction (anti-clockwise), hydrolyzing ATP [230], and pumping
84 ions ininto the periplasm, or the P-side of the membraneperiplasmic space.
85 Doubtless to say, theTo regulation and prevention of wasteful ATP hydrolysis is of
86 critical importance, and bacteria and mitochondria have adapted diverse mechanisms of
87 regulation. To date they have been shown to share a common, yet poorly described, Mg-ADP
88 hydrolysis inhibition form of regulationmechanism [241,252]; however, they, but have also
89 developed other more distinct, organism-specific mechanisms. In mitochondria, the ATP
90 hydrolysis is controlled by the intrinsic regulatory protein IF1 [2326], while most bacteria have
91 been proposed to be regulated via a conformational transition of the e subunit [2427]. The
92 exceptions to this are a-proteobacteria, which have been demonstrated to beare regulated by the <U+03B6>
93 subunit [285–,2630]. Recent structural data in the extended [12] and contracted/hairpin
94 conformation [27] support the interpretation of these biochemical experiments [26]. A recent
95 review comparing the different regulatory mechanisms can be found elsewhere [283]., Due to
96 the unique function of the e subunit in bacteria that is not present in higher eukaryotes and its
97 potential as a drug target, tthe core focus of this article is the role of the e subunit in bacterial
98 F1Fo ATP synthase ATP hydrolysis regulation,. Formatted: Font: (Default) Times New Roman, 12 pt,
Font color: Auto
99 The e subunit harbors two domains. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is a rigid ß-sheet
100 domain, while the C-terminal domain (CTD) comprises of two a-helices connected by a flexible
101 linker [2931]. The CTD has been frequently described as having a dynamic nature, with the
5
102 ability to change conformation depending on the presence or absence of various concentrations
103 of ATP [320–3335]. When these two helices are parallel (i.e. in a ‘down-state’) both spatially
104 localized to the rigid ß-sheet domain and the e subunit is described to be in the contracted
105 ‘hairpin conformation’, a state which is able to be induced by ATP binding [2931,3436–3739].
106 Conversely, when these two helices are in series (i.e. in a ‘rod’), spatially distant from the rigid
107 ß-sheet domain, yet parallel to the <U+03B3> subunit, and reaching into the a3ß3 catalytic hexamer (i.e. in
108 an ‘up-state’), the e subunit is described to be in the ‘extended conformation’ [3840–,3942]. In Formatted: Not Highlight
109 light of the potential interactions the e subunit may have in each conformation, and the kinetic
110 effects of various mutants, the hairpin and extended and hairpin conformations are frequently
111 referred to as theto as the ‘inhibitory’ and ‘non-inhibitory’ states in literature, respectively,
112 regarding the ATP hydrolysis ability of the enzyme. To our knowledge, the first suggestion that
113 the e subunit inhibits ATP hydrolysis in an in vivo setting was described in the Escherichia coli
114 F1 (EF1) domain [40]. In the authors view, until we fully understand the mechanism, it is prudent
115 to simply refer to these conformations by their shape (‘hairpin’ and ‘extended’) until a solid
116 consensus can be reached on the functional mechanism, or whether the strength of the influence
117 of the regulatory role is simply more species-dependent than previously assumed.

154 the state of the field.

156 Current Evidence on the Regulatory Role of the e Subunit
157 Biophysical and biochemical experiments indicate a regulatory mechanism of
158 the e subunit
159 Escherichia coli
160 To our knowledge, the first suggestion that the e subunit had an inhibition role of ATP
161 hydrolysis in an in vivo setting was described for the EF1 domain [42]. Possible regulatory
162 mechanisms of the e subunit inhibiting ATP hydrolysis have been studied extensively.
163 Biochemical cross-linking experiments showed that the e subunit from E. coli could be
164 covalently attached to the a3ß3 assembly [5557,5658], indicating an extended conformation, and
165 was laters resolved in the an F1 crystal structure [3840]. Interestingly, in a different study, the
166 same authors observed that the e-ß crosslink (eS108C- ßD380C) occurs less frequently in the
167 presence of ATP compared to with the presence of ADP or the competitive inhibitor AMP-PNP
168 [5759]. This leads to the hypothesis that the decreased crosslinking might be caused by
169 decreased binding affinities of ADP and AMP-PNP to the CTD of the e subunit, thus allowing
170 the e subunit to stay in the extended conformation.

171 The conformational transition of the e subunit could also behas also been observed
172 usingin fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) FRET experiments [5860]., which Although this
173 was not immediately evident in initial experiments of the same group [5961],. this movement has
174 since been independently confirmed using single-molecule FRET studies, supporting the idea of
175 a conformational transition [62]. In single molecule rotation experiments, the e subunit increases
176 the duration of the pause during the rotational motion of the ATP synthase in hydrolysis
177 direction [6063]., but eS108 (S108A/D) and eY114 (Y114A) mutations, which interact with
178 ßE381:Oex and <U+03B3>G85:O, respectively, (shown in the crystal structure [3840]), respectively,
179 reducinging the inhibitory effect on ATP hydrolysis by the e subunit [6164]. Cross-linking was
180 also observed between ßE381C/ßS383C and eS108C, also suppressing ATP hydrolysis activity
181 [6265]. This study is supported by further studies describing cross-linking between eA117C and
182 cQ42C (revealing the e subunit in a hairpin conformation) andor between eA118C and <U+03B3>L99C
183 (revealing the e subunit in an extended conformation); [5658]). To our knowledge, this was is the
184 first report confirming that the e subunit could exist in two distinct structural states. Furthermore,
185 it has been claimed that inhibition caused by the e subunit is different separate from Mg-ADP
186 inhibition [663], and a dynamic transition between the released and tightly bound auto-inhibited
187 state by the e subunit e has been proposed [66,67]. In additionI, it has also been proposed that the
188 e subunit also fine tunes fundamental steps in the ATP synthesis direction [34,68].
189 Lastly, it should be mentioned that the ATP binding affinity of the isolated e subunit from
190 EF1 (22 mM) [39] is below the average physiological bulk ATP concentration in E. coli cells
191 (1.54 mM) [69], making it seem less likely that ATP has a regulatory function by binding to the e
192 subunit under physiological conditions. Notwithstanding, we cannot discount the potential
9
193 influence of localized ATP pools before diffusion away from the ATP synthase,, a difficult
194 phenomenon to study with any degree of accuracytely.
195
196 Bacillus PS3
197 Both the isolated e subunit from Bacillus PS3 [39,70] and the e<U+03B3>-subunit -complex [71]
198 have been shown to bind ATP. Mutations in the CTH of the e subunit from Bacillus PS3 [39]
199 showed resulted in decreased ATP binding affinity, supporting the notion that this the e subunit
200 from Bacillus PS3indeed binds ATP [53]. AlsoAdditionally, using the F1 complex (TF1), Iino et
201 al (2005) monitored extended/hairpin conformation transitions in using fluorescence energy
202 transfer (FRET) between labeled residues in the e and/or ß subunits. Importantly, this study also
203 revealed that the e subunit has sub-millimolar affinity to ATP at close to the optimal growth
204 temperature of Bacillus PS3, suggesting that the e subunit is an ATP concentration sensor in vivo
205 [32]. However, the time taken for these conformational shifts suggest that the e subunit exerts a
206 slow switch-like regulation of ATP hydrolysis, rather than a rapid movement.
207 HoweverFurthermore, it is noted that Iino et al (2005) also observed that the dependence of the
208 ATP synthetic activity of E. coli F1Fo wild-type (WT) vs <U+0394>e C-terminus on <U+0394>pH and <U+0394><U+03A8> was
209 similar, suggesting that the loss of the e subunit C-terminal helix (CTH) is not rate-limiting for
210 ATP synthesis [32]. Supporting this, single-molecule rotation measurements of TF1 revealed that
211 in the presence of low ATP concentration (200 nM), comparatively more numerous and extended
212 pauses in rotation were observed in the presence of the WT e subunit, than in the absence.
213 However, at a higher ATP concentration (2 µM) the e subunit presence/absence had negligible
214 effect on enzyme kinetics. This study provides support for the slow conformational shift
215 regulation model, and provides insight that the extended conformation may inhibit ATP
10
216 hydrolysis in TF1. However, in a TF1 harboring an e subunit truncation mutant, e<U+0394>CTD, (a stop
217 codon after eD87), no obvious differences were observed in rotation from that of athe WT TF1
218 complex [72].
219 Interestingly, the crystal structures of the isolated e subunit [39], and in the TF1 complex
220 [41], have both been shown to be capable of taking both extended and hairpin conformations. In
221 the case of the isolated e subunit, in the presence of ATP, the overall structure is very similar to
222 that ofthe isolated E. coli e subunit (a hairpin conformation). In the absence of ATP, the NMR
223 structural data was difficult torelatively poorly resolved; however, on the basis of the dihedral
224 <U+03D5>/<U+03C8> angles, the authors were able to discern that a proportion of the molecules formed what
225 appeared to be a long single helix, supporting the notion that the hairpin structure can transition
226 into an extended helical structure, and that that extension of the structure is what drives the
227 inhibition of ATPase hydrolysis at low ATP concentrations [39]. What this study also revealed is
228 that the conformation shift is likely dynamic, supporting a previous finding by Iino et al (2005)
229 and the later observations of Tsumuraya et al [32,72]. Recently, the TF1 crystal structure (a3ß3<U+03B3>e)
230 was solved, where the e subunit was found in the extended conformation, structurally confirming
231 the extended helical structure in a physiological structural context [41]. The crystal contacts, like
232 the e subunit extended conformation E. coli structure,; strongly support the notion that the
233 extended conformation inhibits rotation in the hydrolysis direction. Furthermore, mutagenesis
234 experiments revealed that mutations in either the DELSDED motif of the ß subunit (DELSEED
235 in mammalian F1), or the terminal helix of the CTD from the e subunit, resulted in an increase in
236 the ability of TF1 to catalyze ATP hydrolysis, supporting the proposed role of the e subunit as an
237 inhibitor of this ATP hydrolycatalytic activity. This study also suggests that ATP hydrolysis the
238 inhibition caused by the e subunit may be due to an electrostatic interaction between the CTH of
11
239 the e subunit and the DELSDED motif of the TF1 ß subunit [7073]. In addition, there is a
240 growing body of evidence has been presented describingsupporting the notion that these
241 conformational changes may also be dependent on proton motif force (pmf) [3133,7174].
242 Interestingly, iIt has been proposed that the directionality of the <U+03B3> subunit directs the
243 conformational state of the e subunit., and thatFor this to be feasible, the c-ring must transmit a
244 torque larger than the thermodynamic equilibrium to the <U+03B3> subunit by an increased pmf (~400
245 mV) to revoke the e subunit extended conformation, and initialize ATP synthesis by the F1
246 complex [7275]. In agreement with this theory, it has been shown that the mutation of critical
247 ATP binding residues, E83 and R92 [5153], did not influence the transition from the extended to
248 the hairpin conformation. This, finding indicating suggests that the nucleotide occupation in the
249 catalytic ATP binding site in the ß subunit induces the conformational change of the e subunit
250 [3032] to a half-extended conformation, while in a last step ATP may bind to the e subunit, thus
251 trapping the e subunit in a contracted ATP-bound state. This contracted ATP bound structure
252 stabilizes the hairpin conformation [3335,7376]. Additionally,The justification ithat has been
253 proposed is that during ATP hydrolysis, the contracted ATP bound state is necessary to prevent
254 uncoupling between ATPase activity and H+ pumping [74]. Furthermore, the e subunit has been
255 proposed to decrease ADP binding affinity to the catalytic site (a3ß3) [7578], taking a different
256 mode of action from Mg-ADP inhibition of ATP hydrolysis [7679], and relieving theis inhibition
257 state [7780]. Notwithstanding, this is a difficult puzzle to unravel, since as the extended pauses
258 observed during rotation experiments were at the same angular positions as Mg-ADP inhibition
259 [72].
260
261 Caldalkalibacilus thermarum TA2.A1
12
262 The thermoalkaliphilic bacterium C. thermarum TA2.A1 grows at 65°C and at pH levels
263 between 7.5 and 10.2 on fermentative substrates [81,82], with highest growth rates aerobically at
264 alkaline pH (9.5) [83]. The pH dependent growth is caused in part by inefficient ATP synthesis
265 at pH values below 8.5 caused by a lysine residue (K180) in the a subunit of the ATP synthase,
266 allowing proton translocation and, thus, ATP synthesis optimally under alkaline pH conditions
267 [84].
268 Given the energetically hostile conditions required for C. thermarum TA2.A1 growth, it
269 is essential that such an organism conserve ATP. Therefore, itIt is unsurprising that the has been
270 demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis activity of the F1Fo, or F1 ATP synthase from C. thermarum
271 TA2.A1, is suppressed under physiological conditions, identified by biochemical [48,83,84], and
272 single molecule experiments [85]. Keis et al (2006) demonstrated that in the presence of a low
273 ATP concentration (50 µM), the wild typeWT F1Fo and F1 have negligible ATPase activity,
274 while at high ATP concentrations (2 mM) ATP hydrolysis was observed [86]. This hints to a
275 conformational change of the e subunit from the extended to the hairpin conformation upon ATP
276 binding to the catalytic ß subunit (as observed in Bacillus PS3 [32]) or ATP binding to the e
277 subunit itself. Conversely, in a recent study, regardless of ATP concentration, negligible ATP
278 hydrolysis was observed in the absence of chemical or mechanical activation [85].
279 the ATP hydrolysis activity is not inhibited if ATP binding residues in the CTH,
280 (residues R123 and R127), or if, alongside proposed non-ligand binding residues R116, H117,
281 K118 and R119 (TA2F1 <U+0394>e6A), are mutated to alanine [862], while mutating R116, H117, K118
282 and R119 simultaneously to alanine still prevented ATP hydrolysis activity at low ATP
283 concentration (50 µM) [82]. Collectively, tThese data suggest that residues eR123 and/or eR127
284 bind towards the a3ß3<U+03B3> complex, and could potentially serve to stabilize an inhibitory extended
13
285 conformation, akin to the interaction between eK123 and ßD372, or the salt bridge between
286 eR122 and ßD382 in the e subunit from E. coli and Bacillus PS3, respectively. CuriouslyIn
287 contrast to these clear observations,, a mixed effect was observed upon trypsin treatment, where
288 the WT TA2F1Fo and TA2F1 complexes are protected by trypsin digestion compared to with the
289 TA2F1 <U+0394>e6A mutant, in which the e subunit was completely degraded. We would like to reinforce
290 the point that in Despite of the very same mutant being more active in ATP hydrolysis than the Formatted: Font: Italic
291 WT TA2F1, no further activation of ATPase activity was observed [86]. The reason for this
292 remains unclear.
293 Furthermore, tThe recent structures of WT the WT TA2F1 and a mutant, in which the
294 ATP binding site is lost ( TA2F1 D89A/R92A) mutant, revealed the e subunit in a similar hairpin
295 conformation [4345], similar to that of the E. coli [3436,3638] and P. denitrificans [1215] e
296 subunits. We remind the reader thatNotably, the E. coli and Bacillus PS3 e subunits have also
297 been solved in the extended conformation [3840,3941], so it is while it is curious that the TA2F1
298 D89A/R92A mutant resulted in a hairpin conformation, we know from the more vigorously
299 studied EF1 that this is not entirely unexpected as the conformations are clearly dynamic in Formatted: Subscript
300 nature [44]. Having noted this, tTheoretically, the TA2F1 D89A/R92A mutant should lack the
301 ability to bind ATP, and if this is the regulator inducing the formation of a hairpin conformation,
302 – so one would expect to find an extended conformation e subunit structureenzyme.
303 InterestinglyHowever, this study clearly demonstrates suggests that the lack of ATP presence, or
304 more directly, the lack of an apparent ATP-binding motif, appears to not necessarily mean the e
305 subunit will definitively adopt the extended conformation at all times, if indeed it does in TA2F1.
306 In the context of the previously discussed organisms, tThe structural role of eR126
307 (Bacillus PS3) and eQ127 (E. coli – numbering as in the deposited crystal structure) are not clear
14
308 as these residues are not resolved in the extended conformation in Bacillus PS3 e subunit [41],
309 nor are there are not any obvious interactions with the a3ß3<U+03B3> interface in the (E. coli e subunit)
310 [40]. However, the role of these residues in the e subunit from C. thermarum TA2.A1 in the
311 extended conformation cannot be assumed, as as the e subunit wais neither resolved [87], nor
312 found to reside in the extended conformation [45], in the conditions used in the presently
313 available crystal structures.
314 Lastly, while the focus of this review is on e subunit regulation, it should be mentioned
315 about that the potential role of the <U+03B3> subunit has a potential role in ATP hydrolysis regulation in
316 TA2F1. A mutation changing 8KRRIR12 residues in the <U+03B3> subunit of TA2F1 to 8QQQIQ12 residues
317 (TA2F1<U+03B3>Q4) resulted in a similarly partially active hydrolytic enzyme with similar ATP
318 hydrolysis kinetics as the TA2F1 <U+0394>e6A mutant previously mentioned [87]., Tthe reasons for this
319 are currently under investigation (Knobel et al in preparation).
320
321 Structural properties of the e subunit from bacterial organisms
322 Comparison of structural features of isolated e subunits in the hairpin conformation
323 Although certain crystallographic features of the e subunit have been previously
324 discussed in the context of the biochemical and biophysical section of this manuscript, such is
325 the complexity of the topic that a dedicated section must be presented to give the full picture on
326 this topic.
327 Firstly, we compare the isolated e subunits from different organisms in the context of
328 their highly varieds, which bind ATP with different binding affinities. The crystal structure of
329 the e subunit from Bacillus PS3, shows a well-defined ATP binding motif comprising
330 interactions of E83, D89 (backbone), R92, R122 and R126 with ATP [39]. However, the crystal
15
331 structure was solved as a dimer, thus does not reflecting the monomeric presence of the e subunit
332 in bacterial ATP synthases, making it prudent to take findings with caution. Molecular dynamics
333 simulations have since served to refine models of the ATP binding site, and predict where a
334 Mg2+ ions binds between ATP:Oa/Oß [84], which has also been observed in the structure from
335 C. thermarum TA2.A1 [45].
336 Theis well-defined binding motif in the e subunit from Bacillus PS3 enables the protein
337 to bind ATP with an affinity of 4 µM at 25°C [53]. Interestingly, under the same conditions, a
338 R103A/R115A double mutant was capable of binding ATP with two orders of magnitude
339 increased affinity (52 nM) [54]. This was , which has been proposed to be caused by an
340 increased number of hydrogen-bonds between the protein and the ligand due to a structural
341 rearrangement of the ligand binding site [89]. ATP binding affinities of the e subunit from B.
342 subtilis (2 mM at 25°C) [55], M. tuberculosis (ATP binding was not observed in the measured
343 range) [43] and E. coli (22 mM at 25°C) [39] have also been reported.
344 The available Current structural data (Fig 1a), and a the sequence alignment (Fig 1b),
345 indicate that the proposed ATP binding site composition controls the ligand binding affinity. In
346 the e subunit from Bacillus PS3, positively charged residues can be found [39], some of them are
347 exchanged by polar and/or hydrophobic amino acids in the a-helical C-terminal domainCTD of
348 the e subunit from E. coli [36,38] or T. elongates BP-1 [31] – (see also the sequence alignment in
349 Fig 1b). To derive the reasons for the different binding affinities of ATP to the e subunit from
350 different organisms, we have aligned and compared the sequences of e subunits from different
351 organisms with known Kd to bind ATP (Fig 1b), and compared them to the most well described
352 enzyme for these studies, Bacillus PS3. When comparing between the e subunit sequences of
353 Bacillus PS3 and B. subtilis, there are no differences in the proposed ATP binding motif, yet they
16
354 differ 500- fold in their ATP binding affinity (4 µM vs. 2 mM for Bacillus PS3 [53] and B.
355 subtilis [55], respectively). This suggests that there are other factors to consider.
356 It has been previously proposed that an allosteric Mg2+ binding site causes a reduction of
357 the ATP binding affinity [90], which also is in agreement with the experimentally measured
358 decreasing Kd of the e subunit R84A mutant from Bacillus PS3 [53]. Furthermore, the alignment
359 of the different proposed ATP binding motif residues show that the e subunit from E. coli
360 harbors four divergences from the Bacillus PS3 primary sequence;, E83I, R99K, R122K and
361 R126Q (in alignment positions 86, 102, 128 and 132, respectively). Mutations of three of these
362 residues (E83, R122 and R126) to alanine have shown a remarkably reduced ability of the e
363 subunit to bind ATP for the e subunit from Bacillus PS3 [53], while the R99A mutation showed
364 just a moderate effect in gel-filtration experiments.
365 Subtle divergences in proposed ATP binding motifs in protein sequence alignments
366 appear to have significant effects. The e subunit from C. thermarum TA2.A1 harbors a
367 divergence in the proposed ATP binding motif from the Bacillus PS3 sequence in position 103
368 (R103I in respect to Bacillus PS3, position 106 in alignment). Owing to its structural location,
369 this mutation may indeed increase ATP binding affinity, as shown for the R103A/R115A double
370 mutant from the e subunit from Bacillus PS3 [54], yet t. This proposition remains to be
371 experimentally testedverified. The e subunit sequence from T. elongates BP-1 divergences in
372 respect todiffers from the Bacillus PS3 at positions 95 and 102, which have been shown to
373 reduce ATP binding affinity [53]; however, since as these mutations may not be crucial for ATP
374 binding, the ATP binding affinity might, be theoretically, be expected to be in the higher mM
375 range. The e subunit from M. tuberculosis also harbors mutations in these positions (R92A and
376 R99S, alignment positions 95 and 102, respectively), which has beenwere shown to decrease the
17
377 ATP binding affinity. When arginine residues (R92 and R99) were mutated to alanine residues in
378 the e subunit of Bacillus PS3, the R92A mutation caused a decreased binding affinity of 40 -ffold
379 (4 µM of wild typeWT vs. 160 µM of R92A mutant) [53]. AdditionallyInterestingly, the e
380 subunit from M. tuberculosis also contains a gap of 16 residues in the CTD, thus, missing
381 potentially stabilizing hydrophobic interactions. This gap may cause the current lack of any
382 observed hairpin conformation, as indicated by Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)
383 experiments observations [43], but definitively highlights this e subunit as a unique and
384 promising drug target. .
385
386 Structural features of the e subunit in the a state between the hairpin and (half) extended
387 conformations
388 The first structural evidence showing that the e subunit from E. coli has dynamic
389 conformational changes was an X-ray structure capturing a (half-) extended conformation (or
390 half-hairpin) derived from a <U+03B3>e complex (PDB-ID: 1FS0; Figure 2 - left) [44]. This conformation
391 is dramatically different to from the other presented structures (isolated e subunits), which have
392 been reported to be in the hairpin conformation by NMR (PDB-ID: 1BSN) [37] and X-ray
393 crystallography (PDB-ID: 1AQT; Figure 1 a)) [38]. These different conformations of the hairpin
394 conformation (PDB-IDs: 1BSN and 1AQT) and the half-extended state (PDB-ID: 1FS0),
395 indicate that protein-protein interactions a likely to stabilize the extended conformation.
396 Additionally, cCurrent ATP fluorescence sensors based on the e subunit show that in
397 absence of ATP, an extended conformation will be adopted [69,92,93]. It, an observation
398 supported by the observation has also been demonstrated that the e<U+03B3> complex from Bacillus PS3
399 is capable of binding ATP [71]. If the whole F1 domain is present during crystallization, a fully
18
400 extended state of the e subunit [40] can be observed in F1 from some bacterial species, binding to
401 a3ß3<U+03B3> and, thus, preventing rotation in the hydrolysis direction. Interestingly, a recent cryo-EM
402 study revealed that the e subunits of all (100%) F1Fo particles from E. coli adopt the extended
403 conformation [16]. However, binding conformations of these cryo-EM structures are different fto
404 rom the previously resolved X-ray structures. The structures of the a3ß3<U+03B3>e complex from E. coli
405 [40] and Bacillus PS3 [41] in the extended conformation are shown in Figure 2 (middle and
406 right, respectively). Lastly, Since as the bulk phase ATP concentration in living cells is found in
407 the millimolar range (circa 1.54 mM for the E. coli cell cytoplasm [69]), and the binding constant
408 of ATP to the e subunit from E. coli is 22 mM [39], it would seem logical that the e subunit
409 could theoretically beis predominantly in the extended conformation under physiological
410 conditions., since. However, two factors cannot be excluded: firstly, that the e subunit is in a
411 similar confirmation as the half-extended conformation, as the e subunit will be released after
412 ATP binding to the ß subunit [32]; secondly, the role or possibility of localized ATP pools prior
413 to diffusion into the bulk phase.
414
415 Revisiting the crystal structure from Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1
416 Recent biophysical [32–35,68], crystallographic [40,41], and cryo-EM [16] data support
417 the conclusion that the two C-terminal helicies of the e subunit from different organisms is are
418 capable of undergoing a conformational change from a hairpin to an extended conformation. In
419 the crystal structure of the wild typeWT TA2F1 ATP synthase from C. thermarum TA2.A1, the e
420 subunit is found in the hairpin conformation bound to ATP (PDB-ID: 5HKK), as shown
421 previously for the isolated e subunit from Bacillus PS3 [39]. However, unexpectedly, the TA2F1
422 D89A/R92A mutant is also found in the hairpin conformation, despite ATP not observed to be
19
423 bound to the e subunit in the crystal structure (PDB-ID: 5IK2) [45]. Although tThis is
424 contradictory to our present understanding of the dynamics and regulatory role of the e subunit
425 that we have gleanedhave been observed from concerted E. coli and Bacillus PS3 studies. We
426 make have made the comparison to Bacillus PS3, since as this is more closely related,
427 phylogenetically, closely related to C. thermarum TA2.A1 than E. coli. Firstly, NMR data of TF1
428 showed in the absence of ATP, the structure was difficult to resolve due to dynamic movements,
429 in the absence of ATP [39], but perhaps also due to the lack of true resting conformation, but an
430 extended form was indeed revealed. The C. thermarum TA2.A1 e subunit may simply fall into
431 the hairpin conformation more consistently, providing a tighter trend. This is an interesting, and
432 perhaps unique feature of C. thermarum TA2.A1, because we cannot discount the increase in
433 ATP hydrolysis observed with the <U+03B3> subunit mutant TA2F1<U+03B3>Q4 compared with the native latent
434 WT activity, and possible influences of the <U+03B3> subunit [87]. Secondly, the structure is consisteent
435 with the rotation studies of Bacillus PS3 where the WT TF1 and TF1 e<U+0394>CTH also has have an
436 identical kinetic profile to that of the WT enzyme [72].
437 Another possible, but vastly less interesting reason might lieay with the technical details
438 in the mutant structure [45]. First, we observe two independently crystallized F1 subunits of the
439 ATP synthases in the unit cell, A and B. Second, we observe crucial interactions between the e
440 and <U+03B3> subunits of monomer A (spheres; colored in purple and yellow) with the hexagonal a3ß3
441 assembly of monomer B and vice versa (spheres; colored in gray and lime), as shown in Figure
442 3. Despite the absence of ATP, these interactions may subtly favour the e subunit in the hairpin
443 conformation, since the hairpin conformation could also be observed for the ATP-free,
444 monomeric, isolated apo structure of the e subunit by NMR spectroscopy [31,36] or X-ray
445 crystallography [38]. Protein-protein interactions, which are prevented in this structure [45] by
20
446 interactions of the e and <U+03B3> of monomer A with a3ß3 of monomer B and vice versa, may also be
447 required for the conformational change, as indicated by the crystal structure of the e<U+03B3>-complex
448 from the F-type ATP synthase from E. coli [44]. This is a pertinent point when considering the
449 consistent presence of the hairpin conformation in the absence of the <U+03B3> subunit when resolving
450 full-length e subunit structures [36,38]. However, to confound the matter, the conformational
451 change from the extended to the hairpin conformation of the e subunit in the <U+03B3>e sub-complex is
452 also induced by binding to ATP [71], and is a dynamic movement, therefore, highly conditional..
453 Clearly, there is still much research to conduct before this can be resolved.
454
455 Conclusions and the 6th Antibiotic Target Space
456 Regulatory function of the e subunit
457 Considering biochemical and biophysical measurements, the structural data in the hairpin
458 [36,38,39], extended [16,40,41], and half-extended conformations [44], there are various lines of
459 evidence that support the notion that the e subunit of ATP synthases from at least some bacteria
460 regulate ATP hydrolysis activity. However, taking into account the different ATP binding
461 affinities of the e subunit from different organisms, it can be expected that not all bacterial
462 organisms are regulated by ATP binding to the e subunit under physiological conditions (as in E.
463 coli, the whose e subunit shows has a binding affinity of 22 mM [39]).
464 ATP binding appears to be a strong influence required to stabilize the hairpin
465 conformation and , yet there is still a lack of conclusive evidence on whether ATP synthesis is
466 influenced by the e subunit in E. coli [69,92,93]. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the CTD
467 of the e subunit from E. coli [95], and the ATP-bound down state from the Bacillus PS3 e
21
468 subunit, allow efficient proton coupling to ATP hydrolysis [77]. Together, these data indicate a
469 slightly different working principle in different organisms.
470 In the authors view, what is now of intense interest for this micro-field may be the role of
471 the e epsilon subunit of P. denitrificans and other a-proteobacteria – in which it has been shown
472 that the e subunit does not inhibit ATP hydrolytic activity, but a novel regulatory subunit, the <U+03B6>
473 subunit, that harbors an ATP binding site, is present [29]. It will be of interest to examine
474 whether the <U+03B6> subunit inhibition is influenced by the presence of Mg-ATP.
475 Considering that biochemical experiments demonstrate that the CTD of the e subunit
476 from C. thermarum TA2.A1 has a role in the regulation of ATP hydrolysis activity, but not the
477 TA2F1 <U+0394>e6A mutant, [86], it is curious that the WT e subunit is found predominantly in the
478 hairpin conformation in the absence of ATP. Furthermore, that the TA2F1 D89A/R92A mutant is
479 in the hairpin conformation despite presumably lacking the ability to bind ATP. While it is
480 indeed feasible that the crystal contacts between two neighboring ATP synthases in the crystal
481 may influence both the TA2F1WT and the D89A/R92A mutant structures obtained [45], and it is
482 expected to regulate ATP hydrolysis similarly assimilar to other bacteria, such as E. coli or
483 Bacillus PS3. We cannot discount that mechanisms of regulation may be subtle in their diversity.
484 In addition, it is noted that TA2F1 has seemingly little native ATP hydrolysis activity [85],
485 whereas both the E. coli and Bacillus PS3 enzymes have native ATP hydrolysis activity [96,97],
486 making the C. thermarum TA2.A1 a very interesting enzyme to study to aid in unraveling e
487 subunit regulatory function. At this point, both the structure and function studies suggest a strong
488 role of ADP inhibition [85] and the eepsilon subunit as a releasable ‘emergency break’, similar to
489 the suggested role of mammalian IF1 or the alpha-proteobacterial <U+03B6> subunit. , rather than a more
490 dynamic roleYet functional studies clearly demonstrate a role in ATP hydrolysis suppression
22
491 [86], suggesting a dynamic role that may be precluded by crystallization conditions. The lack of
492 resting conformation shown in the NMR studies of the Bacillus PS3 e subunit support this notion
493 [39]. Taking structural and functional evidence together, a recent claim [45] to have identified
494 the mechanism of the ATP hydrolysis regulation of the C. thermarum TA2.A1 F1 ATPase would
495 seem premature. While the data presented by the authors were crystal structures of excellent
496 quality, the authors did not reveal the role of the e subunit, for which there clearly is a role [86],
497 nor the dynamics of ADP regulation, which is a common mechanism of ATP hydrolysis
498 regulation. Generally, we do not consider observations of TA2F1 structure/function to be
499 dismissive of other studies denoting e subunit regulatory function in other organisms, but they do
500 underline add valuable insight into the subtle diversity and tuning involved in ATP synthase
501 regulation.

503 The 6th Antibiotic Target Space: Pathogen ATP synthases as potential drug-targets
504 Recently, the F1Fo ATP synthases of certain mycobacterial species have been Formatted: Indent: First line: 3 pi, Tab stops: Not at
13 pi
505 demonstrated to be promising new drug targets. The drug bedaquiline (BDQ; previously known
506 as compound TMC207) has been shown to be a novel antibiotic compound against tuberculosis
507 [1], and been shown to bind to a purified preparation of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis c- Formatted: Font: Italic
508 subunit rings, but relatively poorly to the c subunit ring mutant atpEA63P [2]. To support this, a Formatted: Font: Times New Roman, 12 pt
509 recent structural study revealed a model of bedaquiline BDQ bound to the c-ring of M. phelei
510 [98]. Comparisons of with the possible binding mode of the drug to other c-rings [98] suggest
511 possible reasons for selective binding [99] to various mycobacterial species. Previously,
512 computational models had proposed the drug interacting at the c-ring/a subunit interface [100],
513 while, conversely, recent biochemical and structural data from the Grüber group indicate
23
514 interactions with both the c-ring and the e subunit [43,101]. Knowledge about the interactions of Formatted: Font: Italic
515 bedaquiline with the c-ring [] have allowed an intelligent design approach to construct novel
516 potential antibiotic compounds with a reduced backbone while still binding to the ATP synthase
517 of mycobacteria []. Oddly, it would seem that the BDQ binding site, and the subunits being
518 involved are not clear yet, as available data are not yetin consistent. This underlines an inherent
519 risk in the use of crystallography, and the requirement for supporting functional studies. It is also
520 duly acknowledged that inhibitors carrying charges may also participate in favourable charge-
521 charge interactions with proteins under favourable pH conditions, which may confound results to
522 a degree. Full F1Fo time-resolved crystallographic affinity constants in direct comparison with Formatted: Subscript

524 computational studies will be necessarycould be useful tools to clarify the mechanism and
525 binding mode of bedaquilineBDQ. Despite these confounding results, knowledge about the
526 interactions of BDQ with the c-ring [98] have allowed an intelligent design approach to construct
527 novel potential antibiotic compounds with a reduced backbone while still binding to the ATP
528 synthase of mycobacteria [102].
529
530 Mycobacterial species also appear to have developed several mechanisms to Formatted: Indent: First line: 3 pi, Tab stops: Not at
13 pi
531 prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis, an activity that could be fatal for non-growing, infective-phase
532 M. tuberculosis. The first regulatory mechanism is Mg2+-ADP, the second may be using the e
533 subunit [50]; however, an unique loop in the <U+03B3> subunit may also slow down hydrolysis catalysis
534 due to interactions with the c-ring [51], and an extended e subunit CTD may prevent ATP
535 hydrolysis activity due to interactions with the <U+03B3> subunit [52].
24
536 TWhen considering the possible regulatory role of the <U+03B3> subunit in C. thermarum TA2.A1
537 [86], this suggestion appears to have some merit. must t Takeing into account the different
538 elemental mechanistic steps of the bacterial F1 compared to with mammalian F1, as there may be
539 some possibilities to selectively inhibit the function of the bacterial enzyme, as mitochondrial
540 (bovine) and bacterial (Bacillus PS3) ATP synthases have different affinities to various
541 compounds [103]. With this in mind, it would seem a feasible suggestion that Encouragingly,
542 nnovel compounds could be designed, which may uncouple the respiratory driven ATP synthesis
543 [104] by interacting with the c-ring and the a, or <U+03B3> subunits, or e subunits, may be designed. In
544 line with this review, a more bacterial-specificA second possibility would be to develop drug
545 compounds to modulate, which affect the state of the e subunit, by either forcing an unfavorable
546 conformation for the state of bacterial growth (e.g. forcing M. tuberculosis to hydrolyze its ATP
547 while in a slow-growth infective state). Further developments of antimicrobial drugs targeting
548 mycobacterial species may also involve compounds that take advantage of interactions of the
549 unique loop in subunit the <U+03B3> subunit with the c-ring [51], preventing a rotation in synthesis
550 direction or small organic molecules targeting the interface between subunit <U+03B3> and the extension
551 of the C-terminal domain of subunit a [52].
552 However,Lastly, while developments have certainly been made towards targeting the M.
553 tuberculosis, there are several other promising drug targets such as: the F1Fo ATP synthases of
554 Trypanosoma brucei (sleeping sickness) and Fusobacterium nucleatum, that all have novel
555 features. The T. brucei F1Fo ATPase has several unique subunits (e.g. P18) of unknown function
556 [105,106]. The F. nucleatum is has an F1Fo ATP synthase that uses sodium as a common
557 coupling ion, a common feature in human pathogen ATP synthases. Structural insights into the c-
558 ring of this pathogenic organism have been recently been obtained and may denote a possible
25
559 drug target [107]. In all cases, the role of the e subunit is undefined, but given its clear regulatory
560 role in catalysis, there is a strong case to support exploring the e subunit function more widely.

Figure Legends
Figure 1: a) Crystal/NMR structures of the e subunits from Bacillus PS3 (PDB-ID: 2E5Y),
Escherichia coli (PDB-ID:1AQT), Thermosynechococcus elongates BP-1 (PDB-ID: 2RQ6) and
Caldalkalibacillus thermarum TA2.A1 (PDB-ID: 5HKK – only the e subunit is shown; all other
F1 subunits are omitted) in the hairpin conformation. Known and potential binding residues are
highlighted. b) Sequence alignment of the binding site of several e subunits from different
organisms. The binding site residues are colored/highlighted. The sequence alignment was
created using Jalview [91].
Figure 2: The e subunit from Escherichia coli in the half-extended conformation in the presence
of the <U+03B3> subunit (left; PDB-ID: 1FS0), in the extended conformation in presence of a3ß3<U+03B3> (centre;
PDB-ID: 3OAA) and the e subunit from Bacillus PS3 in the extended conformation in the
presence of a3ß3<U+03B3> (right; PDB-ID: 4XD7). In the extended conformation one ß and one a subunit
is omitted for clarity in the extended conformation of the e subunit from E. coli and Bacillus PS3,
respectively. Subunits a3ß3, <U+03B3> and e are shown in green, cyan and red in all figures respectively.
Figure 3: The structural model of TA2F1 D92A/R92A mutant, whose e subunit does not
apparently bind ATP, as deposited in the Protein Database (PDB ID: 5IK2). It can be observed
that the a3ß3 interacts with subunits <U+03B3> and e of the other ATP synthase. Subunits e, <U+03B3> and a3ß3 are
shown in green (red), magenta (cyan) and orange (blue) in cartoon representation respectively.
Contacts of the a3ß3 assembly with subunits e and <U+03B3> in the distance of 5 Å are shown in yellow
(gray) and lime (purple), respectively. This figure was created with pymol v1.7.0
