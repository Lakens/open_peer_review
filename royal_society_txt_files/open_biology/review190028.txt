Dear Editor and authors,
This manuscript entitled " Population genomics reveals possible genetic evidence for parallel
evolution of Sebastiscus marmoratus in northwestern Pacific" analyzed population genetic
structure and local adaptation of Sebastiscus marmoratus by genomic SNPs. The results are
interesting, and can provide useful information for management and conservation of this species.
I suggested acceptation after some revisions. There are some comments as follows.
1. Line 79, Illumina Hiseq2000 platform could output 100-bp paired-end reads. Please check and
revise it.
2. Line 87-88 " SNP filtering was produced using VCFtools24 with the 88 following parameters:
(1) the SNP was called in 50% of individuals (--max-missing 0.5)". The standard of 50% was too
low, and please raise the standard.
3. For population genetic analyses, I would like to suggest the authors analyze the population
structure of the 10 populations based the outlier loci, which could be compared with the
population structure of the four populations.
4. Line 182-183, Isolation by distance theory don’t suit many marine species, especially for low
level genetic divergences among populations. Please rewrite the sentences “According to the
isolation by distance theory, close genetic relationship should be detected in XM-ZH and NI-IK
pairs. The mismatch between genetic distance and geographical distance could be possible
evidence for parallel adaptive evolution.”
5. Discussion should be written more about parallel adaptive evolution and listed more similar
example.
6. Were there some similar morphological characteristics between the samples from XM-ZH and
NI-IK populations?

age is uncovered.
samples sizes aren’t high, but this did not seem to preclude the detection of a signal. However,
e are methodological issues that need to be addressed in the filtering of data for statistical analysis.
biggest issue is that linkage disequilibrium is not accounted for in any manner, and thus the
mptions of the FST and Admixture analyses are being violated. Willis et al 2018 (Haplotyping RAD
an efficient method to filter paralogs and account for physical linkage) explicitly show that
ixture analyses are sensitive to this. The remedy is to analyze 1 SNP per contig or linkage group, or
yze haplotype data. When the analyses are rerun, then it will be possible to evaluate the results and
conclusions based upon them.
lso like to point out that it is important that a study be reproducible, and I encourage the authors to
ide their data processing/filtering scripts as supplements and fully report on their computation and
ratory methods. It is impossible to evaluate the validity of the methods employed as the
uscript stands.

lable, the authors should be able to go a bit farther by assessing the linkage among contigs based on

List of Responses
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you very much for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript
entitled “Population genomics reveals possible genetic evidence for parallel evolution of
Sebastiscus marmoratus in northwestern Pacific” (ID: RSOB-19-0028). Those comments are all
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made correction
which we hope meet the approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The main
corrections in the paper and the responses to the reviewer’s comments are as following:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
1. Response to comment: Line 79, Illumina Hiseq2000 platform could output 100-bp paired-end
reads. Please check and revise it.
Response: We are very sorry for that. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have
reworded the “Hiseq2000 platform” to “Hiseq2500 platform”.
2. Response to comment: Line 87-88 " SNP filtering was produced using VCFtools24 with the 88
following parameters: (1) the SNP was called in 50% of individuals (--max-missing 0.5)". The
standard of 50% was too low, and please raise the standard.
Response: We are very thankful for the reviewer’s comments. We also referred to some
population genomics literatures and have changed the standard to 90%. But the number of
SNPs were the same. We have provided the filtering scripts in the revised version to make
our results reproducible, as per Reviewer #2’s suggestion.
3. Response to comment: For population genetic analyses, I would like to suggest the authors
analyze the population structure of the 10 populations based the outlier loci, which could be
compared with the population structure of the four populations.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have supplemented the population
structure (PCA plotting and Heatmap clustering) of 10 populations based on outlier loci.
4. Response to comment: Line 182-183, Isolation by distance theory don’t suit many marine
species, especially for low level genetic divergences among populations. Please rewrite the
sentences “According to the isolation by distance theory, close genetic relationship should be
detected in XM-ZH and NI-IK pairs. The mismatch between genetic distance and geographical
distance could be possible evidence for parallel adaptive evolution.”
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised this sentence.
5. Response to comment: Discussion should be written more about parallel adaptive evolution
and listed more similar example.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised the discussion to add
more parallel evolution examples.
6. Response to comment: were there some similar morphological characteristics between the
samples from XM-ZH and NI-IK populations?
Response: We didn’t check the morphological characteristics between the samples from XM-
ZH and NI-IK population pairs, since we only had the tissue samples of Japanese individuals.
Further studies are warranted to focus on specific genes associated with biological features
such as reproductive biology.
Special thanks to you for your good comments!
Reviewer #2:
1. Response to comment: The samples sizes aren’t high, but this did not seem to preclude the
detection of a signal. However, there are methodological issues that need to be addressed in
the filtering of data for statistical analysis. The biggest issue is that linkage disequilibrium is not
accounted for in any manner, and thus the assumptions of the FST and Admixture analyses are
being violated. Willis et al 2018 (Haplotyping RAD loci: an efficient method to filter paralogs
and account for physical linkage) explicitly show that admixture analyses are sensitive to this.
The remedy is to analyze 1 SNP per contig or linkage group, or analyze haplotype data. When
the analyses are rerun, then it will be possible to evaluate the results and the conclusions
based upon them.
Response: Thank you very much for the suggestion. According the reviewer’s suggestion, we
have analyzed linkage disequilibrium by using TASSEL software in our revised version. As a
result, a total of 574 SNPs exhibited strong LD and were excluded in further analyses.
2. Response to comment: I’d also like to point out that it is important that a study be reproducible,
and I encourage the authors to provide their data processing/filtering scripts as supplements
and fully report on their computation and laboratory methods. It is impossible to evaluate the
validity of the methods employed as the manuscript stands.
Response: We are very thankful for the reviewer’s comment. However, due to the Illumina
library preparation and sequencing were preformed commercially in Novogene Co. Ltd in
Beijing, some of the steps were commercially confidential data. Therefore, we failed to
supplement the details and data preprocessing scripts in the revised version. But as per your
comment, we provide the SNP filtering scripts in the revised manuscript.
3. Response to comment: The English grammar would benefit from a fair bit of editing.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have modified the Abstract part.
4. Response to comment: 20: be more specific, what is meant by “high minor allelic frequency”?
Response: We are very thankful for the reviewer’s comment. Considering that biallelic SNPs
with rare minor alleles are expected to yield small Fst values, we firstly set the threshold of
MAF to 10% (high minor allelic frequency). However, we referred to some population
genomics literatures and set the threshold to 5% in the revised version.
5. Response to comment: 72-80: more details are necessary here. What were the digest
conditions? How were the barcodes attached? How long were the barcodes? What were the
adapter sequences? Same for PCR. Conditions? Primer sequences? Number of cycles?
Response: We are very thankful for the reviewer’s comment. Just as mentioned in Response
2, the Illumina library preparation and sequencing were preformed commercially in
Novogene Co. Ltd in Beijing, and some of the steps were commercially confidential data.
Therefore, we failed to supplement the details and data preprocessing scripts in the revised
version. We are sorry for that.
6. Response to comment: 81-92: More details are necessary. Each of the programs used to
process the data have myriad settings which need to be reported, otherwise this work cannot
be reproduced. The script used to process the data should be provided as supplementary
material or be deposited in a public database.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have provided the data analyses
scripts in the revised manuscript.
7. Response to comment: 81-92: There seems to have been no attempt to account for the linkage
between SNPs which is important for some analyses, such as global FST calculation, Admixture,
and others. This needs to be addressed and is customarily handled by either selecting 1 SNP
per contig. Given that a draft genome is available, the authors should be able to go a bit farther
by assessing the linkage among contigs based on proximity or using linkage disequlibrium.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have analyzed linkage disequilibrium
by using TASSEL software in our revised version and a total of 574 SNPs exhibited strong LD
and were excluded in population genomics analyses.
8. Response to comment: 108-109: Nucleotide diversity can only be calculated with knowledge
of the sequence length, not only the number of segregating sites. Thus, while you may have
asked arlequin to calculate nucleotide diversity, it does not know the sequence length if you
only gave it SNP data, and thus the values calculated by arlequin are not nucleotide diversity.
This needs to be rectified; 160: as noted above, nucleotide diversity was not calculated in this
study. It either needs to be called something else (mean SNP diverisity) or the lengths of the
sequences need to be accounted for.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have reworded “nucleotide diversity”
to “average SNP diversity” in the revised version.
9. Response to comment: 110: could rarefaction be used here instead?
Response: We are very thankful for the reviewer’s comment. According to the reviewer’s
comment, we have rewritten this sentence in the revised manuscript.
10. Response to comment: 113-115: specify what the clustering on allele frequencies is intended
to accomplish.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have rewritten this sentence in the
revised manuscript.
11. Response to comment: 148-149: while you are doing what everybody else does, I’d like to point
out that the outlier detection methods used are framed to make it very difficult for a locus to
be considered an outlier. Thus, there are many loci that are responding to selection that are
retained in the data set. At the very least, rather than “neutral” you could use “non-outlier” as
a descriptor that would be much more accurate.
Response: Thank you very much for the reviewer’s comment. According to the reviewer’s
suggestion, we have reworded “neutral” to “non-outlier” in the revised version.
Special thanks to you for your good comments!
We appreciate for editors and reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the correction will
meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
Appendix C
List of Responses
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you very much for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript
entitled “Population genomics reveals possible genetic evidence for parallel evolution of
Sebastiscus marmoratus in northwestern Pacific” (ID: RSOB-19-0028.R1). We have studied
comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet the approval. Revised portion
are marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responses to the
reviewer’s comments are as following:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
1. Response to comment: Line 87-92, the parameter scripts can be provided in supplementary
information.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the parameters scripts were shown in
supplementary information (also see Line 92-93 in the revised manuscript).
2. Response to comment: Line 159, the proportion of annotated loci is very low, the authors also
said in line 238 “due to the low-efficiency annotation of GBS technique, genetic variants
associated with reproductive biology were failed to detect in this study”. What is the main
reason according to the authors’ opinion?
Response: We are very thankful for the reviewer’s comments. In our opinion, the low
proportion of annotated loci might be due to the combination of lack of high-quality
reference genome and short assembled contigs of GBS reads (also see Line 158-159 in the
revised manuscript).
3. Response to comment: Were there some similar morphological or biological characteristics
between the samples from the two population pairs XM-ZH and NI-IK? Integrated phenotypic
and genetic evidence, the parallel evolution of this species can be more persuasive.
Response: We didn’t check the morphological characteristics between the samples from XM-
ZH and NI-IK population pairs, since we only had the tissue samples of Japanese individuals.
Further studies are warranted to focus on specific genes associated with biological features
such as reproductive biology.
4. Response to comment: Line 232, the authors stated that “this might be the first report for
parallel evolution in the Northwestern Pacific”, is there any information of possible parallelism
in other marine species? If so, the Northwestern Pacific could be a good region for convergence
studies.
Response: We are very thankful for the reviewer’s comments. To our knowledge, numbers
of warm-temperate marine fish species (such as wrasses) distributed in Japanese coastal
waters and Chinese Taiwan-Fujian coastal waters, yet no record were reported in the north
part of East China Sea. This might be also resulted from the influence of Kuroshio Current
system. We argue that marine organisms in northwestern Pacific should be good materials
for parallel evolution.
5. Response to comment: The format of “northwestern Pacific” should be unified in the
manuscript, such as “Northwestern Pacific” or “the Northwestern Pacific”.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised the manuscript.
Special thanks to you for your good comments!
We appreciate for editors and reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the correction will
meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
