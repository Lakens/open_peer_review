Comments to the Author

Autophagy is a cellular pathway of fundamental importance for cellular homeostasis as well as
nutrient recycling. In recent years it has shown to be important or critical for many normal as
well as pathogenic cellular processes. Due to variations in autophagic rates in different cell lines
and difficulties in interpretation of multifarious autophagy assays, many conclusions about
autophagy in the literature are apparently contradictory.
In this article, the authors review the literature on the regulation of autophagy in selected flavi
and alphavirus infections. They present a comprehensive overview of the events involved in the
initiation and execution of autophagic degradation under normal conditions, before meticulously
reviewing the literature on flaviviruses, mainly dengue but also West Nile and Zika virus as well
as the alphavirus chikungunya virus. The article is very well researched, well written and will be
of great interest to many researchers in the field. Of particular value is the authors attention to the
apparently contradictory conclusions in the literature regarding the positive or negative effects of
autophagy on viral replication. I have only minor concerns which the authors may wish to
address before publication.
Minor issues
Is there some reason why autophagy would be especially relevant for arboviruses? That might
explain why the review fosuses on the mosquito borne members of the flavi and alphavirus
genera? By focusing only on these viruses, the authors are excluding much important work on
the regulation of autophagy in other related viruses, particularly hepatitis C virus infection. Is
there any reason to suspect that the effects of the viruses on autophagy (or vice versa) would be
different in mosquito cell lines or indeed in mosquitos?
There are three main types of autophagy, macro-, micro- and chaperone mediated. This review
refers only to macroautophagy as ‘autophagy’ and ignores the other two types. Is there a reason
for this? Have the other two shown not to be important for these viral infections, or has nobody
looked?
The authors should be more consistent with capitalisation in some virus names. For example, the
first paragraph mentions ‘West Nile <u>v</u>irus’ and ‘Chikungunya <u>V</u>irus’. Also,
Zika and West Nile should be capitalised because they are proper nouns, but dengue and
chikungunya should not.
Page 32, 6 lines from bottom, sentence starting ‘This phenomenon...’: Care should be taken
interpreting results from the Orvedahl paper since they were generated using Sindbis virus

expressing an mCherry-capsid fusion protein. Such a large tag cloned into a protein which
multimerises into a tightly packed symmetrical structure, might well be expected, at least to some
extent, to misfold, aggregate and be targeted for degradation. Some of their conclusions were
challenged by Zheng and Kielian 2013 (PMID: 23785213), using a smaller tag. Also, if results with
Sindbis are to be reviewed in CHIKV-relevant context, then the authors might also wish to
discuss Eng et al., 2012 (PMID: 22438538), studying the regulation of autophagy in the even more
closely related Semliki Forest virus.

light blue background which is close to invisible when printed b+w.

Dear Professor Reggiori,
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-19-0009 entitled "Role of autophagy
during the replication and pathogenesis of common mosquito-borne flavi- and alphaviruses" has
been accepted by the Editor for publication in Open Biology. The reviewer has recommended
publication, but also suggest some minor revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you
to respond to the reviewer's comments and revise your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee.
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
4
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
The Open Biology Team
