This Review by De Ruiter and colleagues summarizes the most recent advances in modeling
human tumors, both in basic and translational molecular oncology research, in the light of big
data and in-depth molecular profiling approaches. The authors convey this complex topic by
introducing the intricacies and challenges of modelling human cancer through three main angles:
1) the difficulties in pinpointing key mutational events and their role at different tumor stages; 2)
the complexity and heterogeneity of human tumors, together with their plasticity and fast
evolution, both in vivo and in vitro; and 3) the convoluted environment that the tumors are
exposed to in their native environments, and how this influences their response to targeted
therapies.
The authors then move on to describe two of the main approaches to model human cancer in the
lab, PDXs, and GEMMs, with the advantages and difficulties that each option pose. They follow
up with a summary of two approaches to identify cancer drivers (mouse tumor sequencing and
comparative oncogenomics) and give some examples of oncogenic events, in different tumor
settings, identified by this approach. The authors then comment on unbiased approaches to
identify novel oncogenes and TSGs, such as in vivo pooled shRNA/CRISPR screens and chemical
or insertional mutagenesis, ending this section by briefly mentioning some of the cutting-edge,
CRISPR-based technologies (single nucleotide editing, transcriptional activation or repression,
etc) that allow fine-tuning dissection of the role of different oncogenic events found in human
tumors.
They wrap up the review by mentioning some approaches to validate the candidate driver genes
identified from tumor sequencing studies, and the power that each of such models above-
described has to harness the contribution of a given genetic alteration during tumor initiation and
progression, as well as to predict drug response and tumor evolution in a real human cancer
situation.
Overall, the review is very well written and easy to follow. The figures and diagrams are well
organized and clear, and the message the authors wish to deliver is very well conveyed. We only
have a few suggestions:
1) The section on mouse tumor sequencing would be an opportunity to add a comment on
spontaneous models of tumor development, such as ionizing radiation or chemical exposure.
This may be of great importance in recapitulating the tumor heterogeneity and stochasticity seen
in a real clinical case, which in turn could turn essential for drug validation. The ease and
reduced cost of sequencing should impact the use of these models (and gene discovery from
them). Alternatively, mention how new genomics technologies complement these models when
3
they are discussed in the ‘chemical mutagenesis’ section.
2) Also, in the mouse sequencing/comparative oncogenomics section – there was a nice example
recently published by Lewis Cantley’s group that would fit well following the mention of
Brca1/2 (PMID: 29203461)
3) The authors mention humanized models on two occasions, but do not provide any information
on what kind of humanization, and whether these efforts face challenges and/or are likely to
address the issues they raised
4) In the mouse models of human cancer section, the authors miss an opportunity to discuss
orthotopic transplants, which have been shown key in recapitulating features of the human
disease, such as exposure to the native tumor microenvironment and in the case of mouse-
derived tumors, to the immune environment. These approaches are fundamental in the light of
the development of flexible and rapid models bearing specific alterations that recap the findings
seen in human tumors (eg, SNV, chromosome alterations, etc), without the drawbacks of GEMMs
and some of the advantages of PDXs. These have been shown recently to be crucial when
modeling advanced stages of the disease, such as in GBM, breast cancer, prostate or colorectal
cancer.
5) It would be nice to see some specific examples (especially in the GEMM section), in key TSGs
or oncogenes identified and validated through the different approaches described in the text.
6) The section on “Validating and characterizing candidate driver genes” is a bit redundant with
previous sections and its main points could be easily condensed to ‘hit the high notes’ or
integrated along with previous parts of the review.
7) I think it would be worth making some comment on where mouse models fit into the
expanding realm of immune-oncology research. Will they be useful?
Minor comments:
1- The use of “drive” or “driver” in the Abstract is sometimes excessively redundant and a bit
distracting as well.
2- There is a “to” repeated in the line 6 of the Abstract.
3- Sometimes the categorization of “passenger” and “driver” genes can be controversial,
especially if the line is drawn between having a clear function or not. Some “passenger”
mutations happen for a reason, or can play a role in clonal evolution or drug response, which is
not necessarily known nowadays; so I would rather tone down comments in the line “passengers
that do not actively contribute to tumor development…” to something milder such as “with no
clear contribution to tumor development”.

De Ruiter and colleagues summarize in their manuscript the state of the art of mouse modelling
for gene discovery and functional genomics.
The manuscript points out critical challenges in cancer research, which cannot be addressed by
conventional methods (such as sequencing), and describes how in vivo approaches can overcome
some of these challenges. The authors provide a very comprehensive overview of in vivo
modelling of human cancer, spanning from patient-derived mouse models (cell lines, organoids,
PDX), to genetically engineered mouse models (transgenic, (conditional) knock-in/knockout) and
the newest approaches for somatic cancer modelling (CRISPR). They also provide an overview of
forward genetic screening in mice, including chemical and insertional mutagenesis, shRNA- and
CRISPR-based screening.
The recent revolution in genome engineering and screening technologies (transposons, CRISPR,
RNAi) offers tremendous new possibilities for in vivo modelling. Given the phenomenal recent
advances in the field and the dynamics of the new developments, the review is justified and
comes at the right time.
Overall, this is an outstanding review by a leading group of scientists in the field, who are at the
forefront of technology development AND application. The manuscript is well written. It
summarizes and discusses advances in a balanced way, including advantages and limitations of
individual modelling approaches. It also discusses translational aspects, such as intratumor
heterogeneity and treatment resistance and provides an inspiring future perspective. The figures
are well chosen and the references are accurate. I only have few very minor comments:
• Mouse tumor sequencing:
The authors rightly point out that sequencing of mouse tumors can provide important insights,
e.g. in the context of predisposing mutations to study gene-cooperative effects. They state that
“[…] mouse tumors may harbor as many aberrations as human cancers […]”. However, for some
tumor entities, cross-species analyses revealed some human/mouse differences with regard to
the mutational load, which is typically lower in murine cancers. While this limitation is
mentioned in “Conclusions and future perspectives”, the authors might consider to briefly
discuss this in the respective chapter (“Mouse tumor sequencing”). They might also consider
discussing advantages that come with a reduced genetic complexity in mouse cancers, offering an
easier interpretability.. and thus to extrapolate the critical genetic driver processes, which can
often be difficult in genetically highly complex human cancers (see for example Nature. 2018 Feb
1;554(7690):62-68).
• Transposon screening in mice:
1. T2/Onc2 transposon (Figure 4B): While the splice acceptor next to the left IR/DR is correctly
5
labelled as “En2SA”, the splice acceptor next to the right IR/DR is only labelled (and described
on page 9) as “SA” (for splice acceptor). The authors might consider to either provide the exact
details (carp ß-actin splice acceptor).
2. Oncogene activation by transposons (Figure 4B): Oncogene activation is illustrated by splicing
from the transposon´s splice donor to exon-1 of a gene. However, typically the splicing process
does not involve exon 1 of a gene, as this exon is not flanked by an upstream splice acceptor site.
Please change the figure accordingly.

1) The section on mouse tumor sequencing would be an opportunity to

use of these models (and gene discovery from them). Alternatively,
mention how new genomics technologies complement these models
when they are discussed in the ‘chemical mutagenesis’ section.
We agree with the reviewer that this is indeed an interesting
application and have added an extra sentence to the ‘Mouse tumour
sequencing’ section commenting on the application of tumour
sequencing to mouse models of spontaneous tumor development
(page 7, first paragraph).
2) Also, in the mouse sequencing/comparative oncogenomics section –
there was a nice example recently published by Lewis Cantley’s group
that would fit well following the mention of Brca1/2 (PMID: 29203461)
This reference is indeed relevant and has been added in line with the
existing text in the ‘Mouse tumour sequencing’ section (page 7, second
paragraph) and the ‘Comparative oncogenomics’ section (page 8,
second paragraph).
3) The authors mention humanized models on two occasions, but do not
provide any information on what kind of humanization, and whether
these efforts face challenges and/or are likely to address the issues
they raised.
We agree that more details could have been provided concerning
humanized models. To address this issue, we have added an additional
paragraph to the ‘Patient-derived models’ section providing more
details on humanized mouse models and their current
benefits/limitations (page 5, second paragraph).
4) In the mouse models of human cancer section, the authors miss an
opportunity to discuss orthotopic transplants, which have been shown
key in recapitulating features of the human disease, such as exposure
to the native tumor microenvironment and in the case of mouse-
derived tumors, to the immune environment. These approaches are
fundamental in the light of the development of flexible and rapid
models bearing specific alterations that recap the findings seen in
human tumors (eg, SNV, chromosome alterations, etc), without the
drawbacks of GEMMs and some of the advantages of PDXs. These have
been shown recently to be crucial when modeling advanced stages of
the disease, such as in GBM, breast cancer, prostate or colorectal
cancer.
We have added a paragraph on murine-derived orthotopic transplants
to highlight the benefit of these models in the GEMMs section of the
review. In our opinion, human-derived models are sufficiently
described in the sections on patient-derived xenograft models (page 6,
third paragraph).
5) It would be nice to see some specific examples (especially in the GEMM
section), in key TSGs or oncogenes identified and validated through the
different approaches described in the text.
We have added specific examples from the referenced papers in line
with the text in the GEMM section of the manuscript (page 5,
paragraphs 4 and 5).
6) The section on “Validating and characterizing candidate driver genes”
is a bit redundant with previous sections and its main points could be
easily condensed to ‘hit the high notes’ or integrated along with
previous parts of the review.
We agree with the reviewer that there is some redundancy in this
section. To address this, we have condensed the text in the relevant
paragraphs (pages 11/12).
7) I think it would be worth making some comment on where mouse
models fit into the expanding realm of immune-oncology research. Will
they be useful?
We agree with the reviewer that immune-based therapies are an
interesting avenue for mouse models in the future. To reflect this, we
have added a section on the outlook w.r.t. immune-based therapies in
our ‘Conclusions and future perspectives’ section (page 15, second
paragraph).
Minor comments
1) The use of “drive” or “driver” in the Abstract is sometimes excessively
redundant and a bit distracting as well.
We have removed several mentions of ‘drivers’ in the abstract to
reduce this redundancy (page 1, abstract).
2) There is a “to” repeated in the line 6 of the Abstract.
This has been corrected in the new version of the manuscript (page 1,
abstract).
3) Sometimes the categorization of “passenger” and “driver” genes can
be controversial, especially if the line is drawn between having a clear
function or not. Some “passenger” mutations happen for a reason, or
can play a role in clonal evolution or drug response, which is not
necessarily known nowadays; so I would rather tone down comments
in the line “passengers that do not actively contribute to tumor
development…” to something milder such as “with no clear
contribution to tumor development”.
We agree with the reviewer that the driver/passenger can be
controversial and have toned down the respective remarks in the
abstract (page 1) and in the second paragraph of the introduction
(page 2).

identifying driver genes. To clarify this, we have added several sentences
to the respective paragraph commenting on the benefits/drawbacks of
lower mutational loads in mouse and tumours (page 7, last paragraph).
2) Transposon screening in mice:
a. T2/Onc2 transposon (Figure 4B): While the splice acceptor next
to the left IR/DR is correctly labelled as “En2SA”, the splice
acceptor next to the right IR/DR is only labelled (and described on
page 9) as “SA” (for splice acceptor). The authors might consider
to either provide the exact details (carp ß-actin splice acceptor).
To clarify the meanings of the different abbreviations (and the
origins of the respective sequences), we have added a description
of the various abbreviations in the legend of Figure 4 (page 19).
b. Oncogene activation by transposons (Figure 4B): Oncogene
activation is illustrated by splicing from the transposon´s splice
donor to exon-1 of a gene. However, typically the splicing process
does not involve exon 1 of a gene, as this exon is not flanked by
an upstream splice acceptor site. Please change the figure
accordingly.
We have corrected Figure 4 by showing splicing to the second
exon of the gene.
