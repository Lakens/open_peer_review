1) The major emphasis is on the work of the authors and hence on the basal lamina and
interactions of the neural stem cells with these. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are mentioned,
but solely with reference to chondroitinase ABC treatment. Some information relating to the
types of chondroitin sulfate and the families of core proteins that expose them should be
provided.
2) The authors also mention heparin sulfate proteoglycans. They might mention that both
syndecans and glypicans have been distinguished in neural tissues. Some of these proteoglycans
regulate integrin functions, which is one focus of the review.
3) The authors discuss laminins and also their potential roles in FGF-signalling towards neural
stem cells. Therefore, they should mention the fractones, laminin-based structures that have been
proposed to serve as storage scaffolds for FGF2.
4) The authors devote some attention to reelin; therefore, they should also briefly comment on the
classical signalling pathway.
5) In figure 3 the authors show the formation of gyri in an explant of human neocortex. They
should specify how the matrix components were applied to the tissue – as soluble proteins or as
plasmids/viruses? While details are part of the publication cited some information should be
summarized here to obtain an understanding of experiment that is documented.
6) Because hyaluronic acid seems important in controlling neural folding the human cortex the
authors might comment the expression of lecticans in the model they discuss.
7) In figure 1 E the presentation could be improved. While in the panels A-D it is indicated
whether Itgs are blocked or stimulated this information is missing in the graphic scheme. Thereby
it lacks clarity, it is not apparent whether stimulation or deletion/inactivation of the ECM
components or receptors causes the effects regarding stem cell proliferation.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewer’s Comments
Reviewer’s Comment:
1) The major emphasis is on the work of the authors and hence on the basal
lamina and interactions of the neural stem cells with these. Chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycans are mentioned, but solely with reference to
chondroitinase ABC treatment. Some information relating to the types of
chondroitin sulfate and the families of core proteins that expose them should
be provided.
Authors’ Response:
We have now included some brief information on the types of chondroitin
sulfate and families of core proteins associated with them in section 2.1.1 of
our review, and have also provided references that give a more detailed
description of CSPGs, as follows.
“There are several major types of proteoglycans (reviewed in (Iozzo &
Schaefer 2015)) but in this section we will focus on the heparan sulfate and
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Both consist of a core protein with one or
multiple glycosaminoglycan chains attached (Prydz & Dalen 2000; Iozzo &
Schaefer 2015), either heparan sulfate (HS) or chondroitin sulfate (CS)
respectively. These chains can be modified, for example by the site of
sulfation in CS chains (Purushothaman et al. 2012), thought to effect the
function of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). The CSPGs include
the lectican family (brevican, neurocan, versican and aggrecan), phosphacan,
CD44 and the transmembrane component NG2 (Faissner & Reinhard 2015;
Iozzo & Schaefer 2015). The heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) include
the syndecans, the glypicans, agrin and perlecan.”
Reviewer’s Comment:
2) The authors also mention heparin sulfate proteoglycans. They might
mention that both syndecans and glypicans have been distinguished in neural
tissues. Some of these proteoglycans regulate integrin functions, which is
one focus of the review.
Authors’ Response:
We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have now included a
brief description of the functions of both syndecans and glypicans in neural
progenitor proliferation in section 2.1.1 and neural progenitor migration in
section 3.1 of our review, as follows.
Section 2.1.1.
“The regulation of neural progenitor proliferation appears to be a conserved
function of many proteoglycans. Another HSPG, syndecan 4, has been
shown to regulate proliferation of neuroepithelial cells within the developing
zebrafish neural tube (Luo et al. 2016). In contrast to perlecan, knockout of
syndecan 4 resulted in an increase in proliferation, whereas over-expression
lead to a reduction in proliferation (Luo et al. 2016). Interestingly, syndecans
are known to interact with and modulate the major family of ECM receptors,
the integrins, (Roper et al. 2012; Morgan et al. 2007), which are discussed in
more detail in the following section.
Another family of HSPGs, the glypicans, has also been identified to regulate
proliferation in the developing nervous system. Glypican 1 and 4 are
expressed in the developing mouse neuroepithelium (Ford-Perriss et al.
2003; Jen et al. 2009), and glypican 1 null mice were reported to have a
decrease in brain size, due to an inhibition of FGF signalling (Jen et al. 2009).
FGF signalling is also modulated by glypican 4, which promotes proliferation
in the developing mouse neural tube via FGF2 (Ford-Perriss et al. 2003). This
relationship between glypicans and FGF signalling appears to be
evolutionarily conserved, as glypican 4 has also been shown to modulate
FGF signalling in the Xenopus embryo to regulate early forebrain patterning
(Galli et al. 2003).”
Section 3.1:
“Several proteoglycans have also been reported to regulate neural progenitor
migration, in particular the lecticans, the major family of soluble CSPGs within
the developing CNS (Bandtlow & Zimmermann 2000; Faissner & Reinhard
2015). They include brevican, neurocan, versican and aggrecan, of which
versican has been shown to inhibit neural crest cell migration in Xenopus
embryos (Szabó et al. 2016). This is consistent with findings in the
developing chick embryo that both versican and aggrecan regulate neural
crest cell migration (Perissinotto et al. 2000).”
Reviewer’s Comment:
3) The authors discuss laminins and also their potential roles in FGF-
signalling towards neural stem cells. Therefore, they should mention the
fractones, laminin-based structures that have been proposed to serve as
storage scaffolds for FGF2.
Authors’ Response:
We have now added a brief description of laminin-rich fractones and their
interaction with FGF and neural stem cell proliferation to section 2.1.2 of our
review, as follows.
“This is also observed in the adult neural stem cell niche that lines the lateral
ventricles in the mouse and human brain, the subventricular zone. Here, adult
neural stem cells proliferate near laminin-rich structures, called fractones, that
capture FGF2 (Kerever et al. 2007).”
Reviewer’s Comment:
4) The authors devote some attention to reelin; therefore, they should also
briefly comment on the classical signalling pathway.
Authors’ Response:
We have now included a brief summary of the classical reelin signalling
pathway in section 3.2 of our review, as follows.
“Reelin has also been shown to regulate neuronal migration via the classical
pathway; binding to the transmembrane receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2
(ApoER2) and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), leading to
phosphorylation of the downstream adaptor protein Disabled-1 (D’Arcangelo
et al. 1999).”
Reviewer’s Comment:
5) In figure 3 the authors show the formation of gyri in an explant of human
neocortex. They should specify how the matrix components were applied to
the tissue – as soluble proteins or as plasmids/viruses? While details are part
of the publication cited some information should be summarized here to
obtain an understanding of experiment that is documented.
Authors’ Response:
We have now included this information in section 4.2 of our review, as
follows.
“This folding was induced by the addition of recombinant HAPLN1,
recombinant lumican and purified collagen I to these neocortex explants
cultures as soluble components, and required this specific combination of all
three ECM components.”
Reviewer’s Comment:
6) Because hyaluronic acid seems important in controlling neural folding the
human cortex the authors might comment the expression of lecticans in the
model they discuss.
Authors’ Response:
Unfortunately, there is currently only very limited information available on the
expression of the lectican family in the developing human neocortex at the
age we examined in our model. However, we have now included the
information of the transcripts of this family of ECM components we obtained
from our previously published developing human neocortex dataset (Florio et
al, 2015; Science) in section 4.2 of our review, as follows. We agree with the
reviewer that is would be an interesting family of ECM components to
investigate in this model.
“In light of the important role of HA, it would be interesting to investigate the
role of the HA-binding lecticans in cortical folding, especially as the
transcripts of all four; aggrecan, brevican, neurocan and versican, are
expressed in the developing human neocortex (Florio et al. 2015).”
Reviewer’s Comment:
7) In figure 1 E the presentation could be improved. While in the panels A-D it
is indicated whether Itgs are blocked or stimulated this information is missing
in the graphic scheme. Thereby it lacks clarity, it is not apparent whether
stimulation or deletion/inactivation of the ECM components or receptors
causes the effects regarding stem cell proliferation.
Authors’ Response:
We have now included this information in Figure 1E.
