This is a fascinating paper on the topical subject of the activation of PDE6 by the alpha subunit of
transducin in vertebrate rods. The paper makes a very important contribution to the field of
phototransduction, and it should be of interest to a wide audience of scientists in the fields of cell
biology, sensory physiology and perception.
Until now, it was generally assumed that the two catalytic subunits of PDE6 were more or less
the same, that they could be activated independently by G-alpha, that the activities of the singly
activated subunits were the same, and that their combined activity of a doubly activated molecule
was additive. Instead, the authors show that PDE6 binds its first G-alpha with high affinity, and
that PDE6-G-alpha has hardly any catalytic activity. It takes the weak-affinity binding of a second
G-alpha molecule to activate PDE6 for cGMP hydrolysis. This detail is extraordinarily important
with regard to physiological function. The authors point out that a consequence is that
spontaneously activated G-alpha can largely be “absorbed” by high affinity binding to PDE6, and
that this effectively sequesters these G-alpha molecules in such a way that they do not produce
cGMP hydrolysis. In other words, buffering of spontaneously activated Galpha by PDE6
circumvents dark noise that these G-alpha molecules would otherwise produce.
The paper is very well written and well organized. The figures and legends are excellent. The
paper is good to go. I find very little to criticize. My few minor comment are listed below.
1. I didn’t understand Eq 2 for the hydrolysis of 8-Br-cGMP until later in the paper. Perhaps the
motivation for the difference between the cGMP and the 8-Br-cGMP could be given just before or
after the equations.
2. In the particle-based reaction-diffusion system, why doesn’t the full transducing molecule
(alpha and beta-gamma subunits together) appear?
3. I like very much the simulation of noise by non-localized spontaneous activation of G-alpha,
and the comparison with localized activation by a single R*. The comparison between the ODE
(single compartment, well-stirred mixture) results and the reaction-diffusion results is also
terrific.
4. In section 4.2 in discussion, shouldn’t an estimate of the rate of spontaneous activation of
Galpha be given in addition to the rate of deactivation by GTP hydrolysis?

Why does it take two transducins to activate the cGMPphosphodiesterase
6 in retinal rods?
Comments to the Authors.
label_comment_3
This is an important paper that sheds light on rather entangled problem of whether the
photoreceptor PDE6 holomer functions as two essentially separated catalytic subunits, or their
activation is interdependent. It may fill a gap in our knowledge that seriously affects our
understanding of molecular details of activation of a paradigmatic GPCR-signaling cascade. The
work is well done and well written.
However, I have a few minor comments, and a major concern considering the presented MS, as
explained below.
Minor comments:
1. Title. To my taste, the title is a bit misleading. The paper does not explain “Why does it take
two transducins…”. It actually establishes the fact and discusses its (supposed) functional
consequences. So I would suggest just “It takes two transducins to activate the cGMP
phosphodiesterase 6 in retinal rods”. As I said, this is just a matter of taste.
2. Lines 155-156. “The rate of hydrolysis was monitored in real-time using a fast response micro
pH electrode”. What was the response time of the electrode?
3. Line 164. Since the measurements were done at 2.5 mM cGMP, the Vmax was obviously
monitored. Are there data on PDE KM? It would be useful to know.
4. Line 171. The equation is not numbered. Also, it is unclear whether PDEs stands for PDE
holomer, or for PDE subunit.
5. Lines 190-191, equations (1) and (2). PDE KM is omitted. This is unimportant for measurements
4
in vitro at a saturating cGMP concentration but may be crucial for functional interpretation of the
results in vivo. I guess one cannot a priori exclude a difference between KMs of two PDE-G*-
bound forms. It is better to state explicitly that the two KMs are assumed equal.
6. Figure 1a. Parabolic shape of the titration curve is one of two evidences of two different
affinities of G*-PDE binding. The curvature is not very impressive in Fig. 1a inset, especially
considering the error bars. Perhaps it would be better to show here the curve from Fig. S1a?
7. Line 295. No hyperbolic curve is immediately seen in Fig. 1a for soluble PDE. Perhaps it is
worth stressing in the legend that just the initial part of the curve is shown.
8. Lines 303-305. To accept that the titration curve for membrane-bound PDE is sigmoidal, a
reader should mentally combine the main (apparently hyperbolic) curve and a short parabolic
stretch in the inset. Could you explain it more clearly?
9. Lines 311-312. “We conclude firstly that the striking difference between the titration curves
obtained with cGMP versus 8-BrcGMP as the substrate, under otherwise identical experimental
conditions, demonstrates that the enzymatic PDE6 activity is determined by more than solely by
the binding of Ga* to PDE6.” I do not understand the sentence. This may be my personal
problem.
10. Line 375. Binding and dissociation rate constants k1, k-1, k2, k-2 are not defined and not used
in the main text. Their meaning is only seen in Supplement where they are used in the scheme in
page S15. However, further they are silently substituted by kon and koff. Please, provide a
definition or refer to Supplement in the main text, and be consistent in notation.
11. Figure 3b (and also Figure S4h). I do not understand why the curve for Ga*PDE formation
(middle panel) is parabolic. Binding single Ga* to PDE is a first-order reaction and has to be
linear. Instead, squared parabola is expected for the Ga*-PDE-Ga* formation (lower panel) since it
needs binding of two Ga*. This is actually seen in Fig. 3B of the accompanying paper by Lamb et
al. Please, explain or correct.
12. Supplement page S16. “use the following formula from5” – should it be “use the following
formula from [5]”?
13. Page S16. “The same value is reported for the G* PDE6 activation rate in ref [23].” Ref. [23] is
a review, and the reported value is not experimental data but derived from various assumptions
and rather complicated reasoning. To my mind, it means that the value is not reported but rather
supposed.
14. Figure S4 legend, line 6. (B) should be (b).
Major concern.
Lines 482 and further. To estimate the average number of spontaneously produced Ga*, the
authors assume the activation rate of 10-4 1/s and the life time of Ga* of 1 s thus arriving at the
number of 2000 for Ga* present in ROS in darkness. Also, the authors state that 2000 Ga* would
produce a large and easily detectable noise (in independent activation scenario) but provide no
reasoning or a numerical estimate. However, there is a big scatter of experimental values in
literature, from 10-5 1/s to 10-3 1/s (reviewed in Melia et al., 1997. Biophys. J. 73, 3182 – 3191).
Besides, one should consider the inactivation rate of Ga* bound to PDE rather that of free Ga*.
Inactivation of Ga*PDE occurs at 2.5 to 5 1/s (accompanying paper by Lamb et al., and numerous
estimates from physiological literature). Thus taking various data from literature one can arrive at
estimates of G* numbers anywhere between 40 and 8000. And it is hardly possible to guess what
level of the dark noise would be produced in each case.
Actually, there is a firm ground to start from. In the accompanying paper by Lamb et al. the
authors show that the continuous noise in mammalian rods can be produced by fully active
PDE**s generated at the rate from 11 to 50 1/s per ROS. In the independent activation scenario, it
would mean the rate of spontaneous Ga* production from 22 to 100 1/s. In the coincidence switch
scenario, it would mean 4500 Ga* per ROS per second. It readily shows the degree of immunity
provided by the coincidence mechanism. Thus, tolerable level of dark Ga* production in case of
independent activation is at the lower border of reported biochemical values, and in case of the
5
coincidence mechanism, in the middle of the reported range on log scale.
I guess that this sort of discussion would support otherwise vague and looking arbitrary
statement.

We thank both reviewers for their positive and constructive comments. We have addressed all
the points raised as detailed below, and have incorporated most of the suggestions in the
revised manuscript.

This is a fascinating paper on the topical subject of the activation of PDE6 by the alpha
subunit of transducin in vertebrate rods. The paper makes a very important contribution to the
field of phototransduction, and it should be of interest to a wide audience of scientists in the

Until now, it was generally assumed that the two catalytic subunits of PDE6 were more or less

legends are excellent. The paper is good to go. I find very little to criticize. My few minor
comment are listed below.
1. I didn’t understand Eq 2 for the hydrolysis of 8-Br-cGMP until later in the paper. Perhaps
the motivation for the difference between the cGMP and the 8-Br-cGMP could be given just
before or after the equations.
We now provide a brief justification for equation 2 (Eq. 3 in the revised manuscript) in
section 2.4.
2. In the particle-based reaction-diffusion system, why doesn’t the full transducing molecule
(alpha and beta-gamma subunits together) appear?
In the visual system, Ga* and Gß<U+03B3> dissociate immediately after R* catalyzed activation of Gt
and it is only the Ga* subunit that activates PDE6.
3. I like very much the simulation of noise by non-localized spontaneous activation of G-
alpha, and the comparison with localized activation by a single R*. The comparison between
the ODE (single compartment, well-stirred mixture) results and the reaction-diffusion results
is also terrific.
Thank you.
4. In section 4.2 in discussion, shouldn’t an estimate of the rate of spontaneous activation of
Galpha be given in addition to the rate of deactivation by GTP hydrolysis?
We state in the manuscript that "The intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate of rod G protein is
about 10-4/s in vitro at 37°C [56]." For a discussion of this point see our answer to the last
point of referee 2 below.

This is an important paper that sheds light on rather entangled problem of whether the
photoreceptor PDE6 holomer functions as two essentially separated catalytic subunits, or their
activation is interdependent. It may fill a gap in our knowledge that seriously affects our
understanding of molecular details of activation of a paradigmatic GPCR-signaling cascade.
The work is well done and well written.
However, I have a few minor comments, and a major concern considering the presented MS,
as explained below.
Minor comments:
1. Title. To my taste, the title is a bit misleading. The paper does not explain “Why does it
take two transducins…”. It actually establishes the fact and discusses its (supposed) functional
consequences. So I would suggest just “It takes two transducins to activate the cGMP
phosphodiesterase 6 in retinal rods”. As I said, this is just a matter of taste.
We changed the title as suggested.
2. Lines 155-156. “The rate of hydrolysis was monitored in real-time using a fast response
micro pH electrode”. What was the response time of the electrode?
The response time of the electrode is < 15 s to reach pH 7.000 ± 0.030 from pH 10.012
according to the manufacture's specification. The response time for the small pH changes in
our measurements (hydrolysis of 2.5 mM cGMP resulted in a pH change of 0.2 units) was less
than 1 s. We tested eight different electrodes of the same type with respect to response-time
and stability and used the best one.
3. Line 164. Since the measurements were done at 2.5 mM cGMP, the Vmax was
obviously monitored. Are there data on PDE KM? It would be useful to know.
The Km of PDE6 for cGMP is 15 µM and for 8-Br-cGMP 160 µM, i.e. both values are well
below the nucleotide concentration used in our experiments. We now refer to these values in
section 2.3.
4. Line 171. The equation is not numbered. Also, it is unclear whether PDEs stands for
PDE holomer, or for PDE subunit.
All equations are now numbered.
PDEs refers to PDE subunits. This was only explained in the appendix and is now stated also
in section 2.4.
5. Lines 190-191, equations (1) and (2). PDE KM is omitted. This is unimportant for
measurements in vitro at a saturating cGMP concentration but may be crucial for functional
interpretation of the results in vivo. I guess one cannot a priori exclude a difference between
KMs of two PDE-G*-bound forms. It is better to state explicitly that the two KMs are
assumed equal.
We agree that the KM-values are important for interpreting in vivo data because cGMP
concentration is low in outer segments. However, as the referee correctly states, the KMs are
unimportant in vitro. We note that different KMs of the two PDE-Ga*-bound forms are
certainly possible but do not matter as long as the two KM values are well below the
concentration of nucleotides used in the experiments. An explicit assumption as to the KMs is
therefore not made.
6. Figure 1a. Parabolic shape of the titration curve is one of two evidences of two different
affinities of G*-PDE binding. The curvature is not very impressive in Fig. 1a inset, especially
considering the error bars. Perhaps it would be better to show here the curve from Fig. S1a?
For a more detailed answer see point 8 below.
Fig. S1 plots the same data as shown in Fig. 1.
7. Line 295. No hyperbolic curve is immediately seen in Fig. 1a for soluble PDE. Perhaps
it is worth stressing in the legend that just the initial part of the curve is shown.
We have added a sentence to the legend to emphasize this.
8. Lines 303-305. To accept that the titration curve for membrane-bound PDE is sigmoidal,
a reader should mentally combine the main (apparently hyperbolic) curve and a short
parabolic stretch in the inset. Could you explain it more clearly?
We agree that the sigmoidal shape of the curve in Figure 1a is difficult to see on the scale of
the main panel. However, it is clearly seen on the expanded scales of the inset. We changed
the text in section 3.2 to make this clearer. Furthermore, we now include a hyperbolic fit in
Fig. S1b. It is clearly seen that in the presence of membranes the data points at low Ga*
concentrations deviate significantly from this hyperbolic fit.
9. Lines 311-312. “We conclude firstly that the striking difference between the titration
curves obtained with cGMP versus 8-BrcGMP as the substrate, under otherwise identical
experimental conditions, demonstrates that the enzymatic PDE6 activity is determined by
more than solely by the binding of Ga* to PDE6.” I do not understand the sentence. This may
be my personal problem.
We reworded this sentence to make it more comprehensible.
10. Line 375. Binding and dissociation rate constants k1, k-1, k2, k-2 are not defined and
not used in the main text. Their meaning is only seen in Supplement where they are used in
the scheme in page S15. However, further they are silently substituted by kon and koff.
Please, provide a definition or refer to Supplement in the main text, and be consistent in
notation.
We now refer to the Appendix in the text. Please note that in the Appendix kon and koff,
respectively, were used when we refer to on- and off rate constants in general. k1, k-1, k2 and
k-2 were used for the specific rate constants of the individual steps.
11. Figure 3b (and also Figure S4h). I do not understand why the curve for Ga*PDE
formation (middle panel) is parabolic. Binding single Ga* to PDE is a first-order reaction and
has to be linear. Instead, squared parabola is expected for the Ga*-PDE-Ga* formation (lower
panel) since it needs binding of two Ga*. This is actually seen in Fig. 3B of the accompanying
paper by Lamb et al. Please, explain or correct.
Both, fully activated PDE (PDE**) and singly activated PDE (PDE*) rise as a delayed ramp
(Fig. 3B of Lamb et al.) because both, formation of Ga* and subsequent binding of Ga* to
PDE shape the curve. The relatively long delay in our simulations is due to slower on-rates as
compared to Lamb et al (and to a lesser extent due to dissociation of Ga* from PDE, which is
not included in the simulations of Lamb et al.). As seen in the figure below, the faster the on-
rates are, the smaller is the delay. Notably, even a 10-fold increase of the on-rates (blue
traces) does not significantly influence the general conclusion, i.e. virtually no fully active
PDE is formed within the first 100 ms of the simulations.

12. Supplement page S16. “use the following formula from5” – should it be “use the
following formula from [5]”?
Thank you for spotting this mistake, which has been fixed now.
13. Page S16. “The same value is reported for the G* PDE6 activation rate in ref [23].”
Ref. [23] is a review, and the reported value is not experimental data but derived from various
assumptions and rather complicated reasoning. To my mind, it means that the value is not
reported but rather supposed.
We agree and changed the text accordingly.
14. Figure S4 legend, line 6. (B) should be (b).
We fixed this.
Major concern.
Lines 482 and further. To estimate the average number of spontaneously produced Ga*, the
authors assume the activation rate of 10-4 1/s and the life time of Ga* of 1 s thus arriving at
the number of 2000 for Ga* present in ROS in darkness. Also, the authors state that 2000 Ga*
would produce a large and easily detectable noise (in independent activation scenario) but
provide no reasoning or a numerical estimate. However, there is a big scatter of experimental
values in literature, from 10-5 1/s to 10-3 1/s (reviewed in Melia et al., 1997. Biophys. J. 73,
3182 – 3191). Besides, one should consider the inactivation rate of Ga* bound to PDE rather
hat of free Ga*. Inactivation of Ga*PDE occurs at 2.5 to 5 1/s (accompanying paper by Lamb
et al., and numerous estimates from physiological literature). Thus taking various data from
iterature one can arrive at estimates of G* numbers anywhere between 40 and 8000. And it is
hardly possible to guess what level of the dark noise would be produced in each case.
Actually, there is a firm ground to start from. In the accompanying paper by Lamb et al.
he authors show that the continuous noise in mammalian rods can be produced by fully active
PDE**s generated at the rate from 11 to 50 1/s per ROS. In the independent activation
scenario, it would mean the rate of spontaneous Ga* production from 22 to 100 1/s. In the
coincidence switch scenario, it would mean 4500 Ga* per ROS per second. It readily shows
he degree of immunity provided by the coincidence mechanism. Thus, tolerable level of dark
Ga* production in case of independent activation is at the lower border of reported
biochemical values, and in case of the coincidence mechanism, in the middle of the reported
ange on log scale.
guess that this sort of discussion would support otherwise vague and looking arbitrary
statement.
Since the accompanying paper by Lamb et al is now accepted, we can in the revised
manuscript refrain from a detailed discussion at this point. Referring to Lamb et al for a
detailed discussion, we now arrive at the simple statement that a detectable noise component
would be expected if each Ga* bound to PDE would induce cGMP hydrolysis.
