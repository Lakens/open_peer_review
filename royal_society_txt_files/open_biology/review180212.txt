The manuscript entitled “Emerging microRNA biomarkers for colorectal cancer diagnosis and
prognosis” reviewed the latest progress of potential applications of microRNA as biomarkers for
the diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors also discussed the
advantages of using microRNA as biomarkers and the technical progresses in microRNA
detection. This manuscript is well organized. The topic and content are attractive, providing a
very good literature resource for understanding the progress of microRNA research in cancer
studies.
The manuscript may be accepted for publication in the journal when several issues are properly
addressed or corrected.
1. It would be better if the disadvantages of using microRNA as biomarkers are also summarized
and discussed in the section subtitled “Advantages of microRNA biomarkers” on page 8.
2. Is the list of microRNA biomarkers specific for CRC? Can any of them be applied to other types
of cancers?
3. Some sentences are not clear. For example: On the line 7, page 5, the sentence “Regarding to
lymph node metastasis, although a previous evaluation about the correlations of miRNA
expression patterns with CRC tumor stage by using miRNA microarrays showed no significant
differences”. On the line 24, page 5, the sentence “Furthermore, miRNAs have great potential in
CRC treatment and the overcome of resistance to cancer therapy ” is difficult to understand.
4. Abbreviations should be consistency in the manuscript. For example, the miRNA and
microRNA. On the line 14, page 8, the form of the letter “p” (p < 0.001 and P = 0.004).

The reviewer appreciated the opportunity to be invited to read and revise the manuscript.
However, the reviewer just felt it would be much convenient to do the review if the editorial
provides line numbers to the article, especially to such as a long review article.
Overall, the manuscript was well written, and the citations were comprehensive. Actually, all the
references were checked manually to ensure correct citation. Minor revisions:
1. Page 3 (Introduction), 3rd paragraph: “as promising biomarkers 8.” Need format revision.
2. Page 4 (Aberrant miRNA expressions and roles in CRC), 1st paragraph: please make sure [23]
is the right reference; may include the MiR-7, 192/215 and 19b-1 into Table 1.
2nd paragraph: “… SALL4, BMI1 and BMI1 [36]”. Please remove duplicates.
3. Page 5, 2nd paragraph: “Through bioinformatics analysis form the Cancer Genome Atlas”,
should be “from”.
4. Page 7, 3rd paragraph: “Exosomes represent a kind of intracellular vesicles …”. Is it
“extracellular”?
TNM: please define.
5. Page 8: ref [90]: please make sure it is the right ref.
The middle section (e.g., %, specificity, sensitivity) is confusing; should be clarified or moved to

Dear Editors,
On behalf of my co-authors, I would like to submit our revised
paper entitled “Emerging microRNA biomarkers for colorectal cancer
diagnosis and prognosis” for publication in Open Biology. According
to the editorial comments, we dealt carefully with each of the points.
Here, our point-by-point responses to the reviewers’ comments were
integrated into the revised manuscript as enumerated below.
Referee 1
Comment 1. It would be better if the disadvantages of using
microRNA as biomarkers are also summarized and discussed in the
section subtitled “Advantages of microRNA biomarkers” on page 8.
Response: We agree with the reviewer’s good suggestion. In the
revised version, we have added the concerns of disadvantages and
specificity of microRNA biomarkers for CRC on page 9.
Comment 2. Is the list of microRNA biomarkers specific for
CRC? Can any of them be applied to other types of cancers?
Response: Some predictive candidate miRNAs biomarkers are
not specific for CRC, which are also reported to have diagnosis
potentials for other kind of cancers. Fortunately, a panel of miRNAs
can be used to distinguish CRC patients from healthy controls with a
relative high sensitivity and specificity by testing in a large population
of subjects. Therefore several miRNAs combinations are feasible to
monitor cancer profiling. We have summarized and discussed the
specificity of microRNA biomarkers for CRC on page 9.
Comment 3. Some sentences are not clear. For example: On the
line 7, page 5, the sentence “Regarding to lymph node metastasis,
although a previous evaluation about the correlations of miRNA
expression patterns with CRC tumor stage by using miRNA
microarrays showed no significant differences”. On the line 24, page 5,
the sentence “Furthermore, miRNAs have great potential in CRC
treatment and the overcome of resistance to cancer therapy ” is
difficult to understand.
Response: We have carefully modified the language expression
of the whole manuscript and made them easier to understand.
Comment 4. Abbreviations should be consistency in the
manuscript. For example, the miRNA and microRNA. On the line 14,
page 8, the form of the letter “p” (p < 0.001 and P = 0.004).
Response: We have carefully checked and corrected the
abbreviations in the revised version.
Referee 2
Comment 1. Page 3 (Introduction), 3rd paragraph: “as promising
biomarkers 8.” Need format revision.
Response: We are sorry for our carelessness. Now the mistake
has been corrected.
Comment 2. Page 4 (Aberrant miRNA expressions and roles in
CRC), 1st paragraph: please make sure [23] is the right reference; may
include the MiR-7, 192/215 and 19b-1 into Table 1. 2nd paragraph:
“… SALL4, BMI1 and BMI1 [36]”. Please remove duplicates.
Response: We are sorry for the previous error, and now we have
corrected the ref[23] with a right one. We have added MiR-7, 192/215
and 19b-1 into Table 1 and removed the duplicated BMI1.
Comment 3. Page 5, 2nd paragraph: “Through bioinformatics
analysis form the Cancer Genome Atlas”, should be “from”.
Response: We have revised these mistakes and supplemented the
Table 1 in the latest manuscript.
Comment 4. Page 7, 3rd paragraph: “Exosomes represent a kind
of intracellular vesicles …”. Is it “extracellular”? TNM: please
define.
Response: We are appreciated to the reviewer’s correction. And
the abbreviation TNM has been defined on the Line 27 of Page 7.
Comment 5. Page 8: ref [90]: please make sure it is the right ref.
The middle section (e.g., %, specificity, sensitivity) is confusing;
should be clarified or moved to Table 2.
Response: The previous ref [90] has been checked and replaced
with the current ref[108] in this revised version. And the relative
content has been supplemented in the Table 2.
Comment 6. Page 9, 2nd paragraph: regarding the ref [90],
please double-check the descriptions in this paragraph and ensure this
is the right article to cite.
Response: The previous ref [90] has been checked and replaced
with the current ref[108] in this revised version. The descriptions in
this paragraph have been carefully checked, and the content here is
derived from the right reference.
Comment 7. Page 11, 1st paragraph: “89Y?.” Please clarify.
3rd paragraph: “immune-affinity” should be immune-affinity?
Table 1: “miR-205-5p” needs one more citation [26].
“miR-214”: ref [32] is not appropriate.
Response: We are sorry for citing the wrong reference previously.
We have replaced them with the right ones and updated the
descriptions in the revised manuscript.
