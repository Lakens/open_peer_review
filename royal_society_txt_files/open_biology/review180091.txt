In this manuscript Yu et al. study the correlation between the presence of arachidonic acid (AA)
and its metabolites in human sperm with sperm reduced motility- asthenozoospermia. The
authors suggest that AA higher content negatively affects sperm motility and that concentration
of AA metabolites is significantly decreased in astenozoospermic patients. The authors indicate
that arachidonic acid content evaluation could be a valuable biomarker for fertility diagnostics.
The experiments heavily rely on using mass spectrometry approach, which in its turn relies on
the quality of the human sperm samples used. In this regard I have several major concerns:
1. Human sperm samples- have the fertility of human donors (control cohort) or their ability to
undergo capacitation and hyperactivation been verified? If not, it should be stated.
2. What g-force was used to perform sperm centrifugation (so far only rpm is given)? Excessive g-
force can damage human sperm and alter their compoisiton and lipidomics. Usually, swim up is
used to select the healthy and motile fraction of sperm.
3. How exactly sperm capacitation was performed? What is the composition of BWW medium
used in these experiments? Did the medium contain sufficient amount of bicarbonate, and
albumin to ensure capacitation? Was the incubation done at 37C with unrestricted access to C02
(such as 5% C02 incubator)- the “must-have” for capacitation? This part is not mentioned at all.
4. According to description, human sperm cells were capacitated for 1 hour- this is not enough
time for human sperm cells, which require capacitation for at least 3 hours (better 4-5). One-hour
capitation is a good time for rodent sperm, but definitely not for the primate sperm.
5. How capacitation was confirmed? Tyrosine phosphorylation profile? Motility changes?
Acrosome reaction status (FITC-PSA staining)? Unless the fact that sperm cells were indeed
capacitated is proven, this reviewer has a hard time to believe that sperm were indeed
capacitated.
6. AA could be also a metabolite of 2-arachidoyl-glycerol (2AG). Did authors look at the presence
of 2AG and whether there is any correlation between 2Ag presence and motility changes?
7. Figure 2E: it hard to see that data indicated by statistical differences of “*” are actually
different, unless the individual data used to build the graph, and not only mean+/-sd/sem are
given. It is a common trend now to show the individual data, as well as possible outliers, and not
only “means”.
Minor concern:
1. Not sure abbreviations such as MAPK is good to use in the title.

The manuscript described an important finding that arachidonic acid, its lipoxygenase and
cytochrome P450 metabolites were abnormally increased in asthenozoospermic volunteers by
means of metabolomics. Further studies revealed that decreased sperm motility and upregulation
of sperm phosphor-P38 by arachidonic acid, which was confirmed by inhibition of its metabolic
pathways. It is a good study in general and worth to be considered for publishing. However,

Dear Editor,
RE: Ms. No. RSOB-18-0091
We would like to thank you and the reviewers for the helpful comments
and suggestions as well as the time and effort spent reviewing this
manuscript. We have addressed all the reviewers’ comments point by
point and revised our manuscript accordingly. Please see below
responses following each comment. Changes are either made via
tracking tool or highlighted in red in the revised manuscript. We thank
you for your editorial efforts in advance and look forward to the
acceptance of this article.
Referee #1:
In this manuscript Yu et al. study the correlation between the presence
of arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites in human sperm with sperm
reduced motility- asthenozoospermia. The authors suggest that AA
higher content negatively affects sperm motility and that concentration
of AA metabolites is significantly decreased in asthenozoospermic
patients. The authors indicate that arachidonic acid content evaluation
could be a valuable biomarker for fertility diagnostics.
The experiments heavily rely on using mass spectrometry approach,
which in its turn relies on the quality of the human sperm samples used.
In this regard I have several major concerns.
Major concern:
1) Human sperm samples- have the fertility of human donors (control
cohort) or their ability to undergo capacitation and hyperactivation been
verified? If not, it should be stated.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The fertility and their ability
to undergo capacitation and hyperactivation of human donors usually
are not examined in outpatient department. Semen routine analysis
includes other parameters such as semen volume, color, pH, vitality,
motility, microscopy, etc. And we have deleted previous description of
“capacitation” and modified relevant information in the experiment
process. Thus fertility, capacitation and hyperactivation ability were not
tested and not stated in this paper.
2) What g-force was used to perform sperm centrifugation (so far only
rpm is given)? Excessive g-force can damage human sperm and alter
their composition and lipidomics. Usually, swim up is used to select the
healthy and motile fraction of sperm.
Response: Thank you for your kind suggestion. G-force (300 g) used to
perform sperm centrifugation was now stated in Section 2.1.
In fact, swim up and Percoll gradient are both widely used to separate
motile spermatozoa. Of course, only one of them could be used for one
single experiment. It has been reported that the ability of Percoll
gradient preparation to extract motile spermatozoa was higher than that
of the swim up preparation [1, 2] and has been adopted in many
literatures [3, 4]. Therefore, discontinuous Percoll gradient
centrifugation was used in this paper.
3) How exactly sperm capacitation was performed? What is the
composition of BWW medium used in these experiments? Did the
medium contain sufficient amount of bicarbonate, and albumin to
ensure capacitation? Was the incubation done at 37C with unrestricted
access to CO2 (such as 5% CO2 incubator)- the “must-have” for
capacitation? This part is not mentioned at all.
Response: Thank you for your valuable comment. Spermatozoa were
separated from semen by discontinuous Percoll gradient, as mentioned
in the manuscript. Resuspended spermatozoa in BWW medium were
incubated for 1 h at 37 <U+2103> in humidified air with 5% CO2 in a cell
culture incubator. This part has been added in Section 2.7 in the revised
manuscript.
We checked the in vitro sperm experimental process in this study
carefully. Actually, BWW incubation was a pre-incubation process,
instead of sperm capacitation which could be confirmed, and was mis-
defined as capacitation in the original manuscript.
Besides, sperm motility was what we studied on, rather than
capacitation status. And in the previous literatures [5, 6], examination
of sperm capacitation status was not involved in the studies which
focused on sperm motility. Thus capacitation was not necessary in our
research. To avoid the confusion, we replaced previous description of
“capacitation” with “preincubation”. And relevant information was
modified in the revised manuscript.
In this study, BWW medium was a mature commercial product.
Therefore, the composition was not described in the manuscript. It
contains sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride,
potassium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate, sodium
bicarbonate, glucose, sodium pyruvate, sodium lactate, HEPES, bovine
serum albumin.
4) According to description, human sperm cells were capacitated for 1
hour- this is not enough time for human sperm cells, which require
capacitation for at least 3 hours (better 4-5). One-hour capitation is a
good time for rodent sperm, but definitely not for the primate sperm.
Response: Thank you for your valuable input. As mentioned in (3),
capacitation was not performed in our research, so we have modified
relevant description to avoid the confusion.
5) How capacitation was confirmed? Tyrosine phosphorylation profile?
Motility changes? Acrosome reaction status (FITC-PSA
staining)? Unless the fact that sperm cells were indeed capacitated is
proven, this reviewer has a hard time to believe that sperm were indeed
capacitated.
Response: Thank you for your comment. As mentioned in (3),
capacitation was not performed or confirmed in our research, so we have
modified relevant description to avoid the confusion.
6) AA could be also a metabolite of 2-arachidoyl-glycerol (2AG). Did
authors look at the presence of 2AG and whether there is any correlation
between 2Ag presence and motility changes?
Response: Thank you for your valuable input. Our research was a
targeted metabolomics research of the association between AA
metabolic network and asthenozoospermia. What we focus on was AA
and its metabolites. Since AA could be a metabolite of 2-AG, we did not
take 2-AG into consideration. The correlation between 2-AG presence
and motility changes was not included in the study.
7) Figure 2E: it hard to see that data indicated by statistical differences
of “*” are actually different, unless the individual data used to build the
graph, and not only mean+/-sd/sem are given. It is a common trend now
to show the individual data, as well as possible outliers, and not only
“means”.
Response: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. Individual data of
sperm motility have been uploaded as Supplement Material.
Minor concern:
1) Not sure abbreviations such as MAPK is good to use in the title.
Response: Thank you for your comment. MAPK is short for mitogen-
activated protein kinase. Usually, when an abbreviation appears for the
first time, the full name should be given. But mitogen-activated protein
kinase is a little long to be included in the title. And MAPK is very
familiar for researchers and is widely used in the title in many literatures
[7-10]. Therefore the full name of MAPK has not been given in the title.

Referee #2:
The manuscript described an important finding that arachidonic acid, its
lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 metabolites were abnormally
increased in asthenozoospermic volunteers by means of metabolomics.
Further studies revealed that decreased sperm motility and upregulation
of sperm phosphor-P38 by arachidonic acid, which was confirmed by
inhibition of its metabolic pathways. It is a good study in general and
worth to be considered for publishing.
1) Scientific writing need to be improved before acceptance.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have made corrections to
those spelling and grammatical errors. And the paper was extensively
modified to improve scientific writing. Please let us know if another
round of revision is needed.
2) Fig. 2 All western blot images were manipulated and some were not
aligned well, the original images are required to verify the results. How
the intensity of the western blot bands was evaluated and the value
should be presented for statistical analysis.
Response: Thanks for your advice. Original western blot images have
been uploaded as Supplement Material to verify the results. Protein
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo
Scientific, USA) and the intensity was quantified using the ChemiScope
3400 Mini (Clinx Science Instruments, China). The relevant
information has been added in Section 2.10 in the revised manuscript.
3) Supplement Fig 1 need to label what each peak stands for, otherwise
difficult to understand
Response: Thanks for your valuable advice. Each peak in Supplement
Fig 1 has been labelled now. Besides, we reordered the compounds in
Table 1 which listed the AA metabolites detected in human seminal
plasma according to the retention time of the metabolites to help
understanding.

Dear Editor,
RE: Ms. No. RSOB-18-0091.R1
We would like to thank you and the reviewers so much for the helpful
comments and valuable advices as well as the time and effort spent
reviewing our manuscript entitled "Abnormal arachidonic acid metabolic
network may reduce sperm motility via P38 MAPK". We have addressed the
Referee 2's comments point by point and revised our manuscript
accordingly. Please see below responses following each comment.
Changes are highlighted in red in the revised manuscript. We thank you
so much for your editorial efforts.
Referee #2:
The authors made a very good revision with most questions successfully
rebutted.
1) However, the requirement of uploading full gel Western Blot images
is not fulfilled (still manipulated cut band).
Response: Thank you for your comment. Actually, the individual
western blot images we uploaded were the original images.
In our WB experiment, the protein samples are separated by vertical
electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig.a). The approximate position
of target protein band is determined by prestained protein marker (Fig.b).
The gel was then cut and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Fig.c),
which was then blocked by 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and react with first
antibodies at 4 <U+2103> overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies were subsequently used to incubate and visualize
the protein bands by chemiluminescence method. Horseradish enzyme
catalyzed the chemiluminescence reaction of ECL solution A and B, and
the intensity was detected by ChemiScope 3400 Mini instrument (Fig.d).
After the protein was transferred from the gel onto the PVDF membrane,
all subsequent operations were performed with the PVDF membrane, so
the gel was discarded after the protein was transferred (Fig.e). Unlike
DNA Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (Fig.f) whose results are analyzed by
gel imaging system, our WB results are analyzed by the
chemiluminescence of PVDF membrane, therefore the full gel of
Western Blot images are not given.

2) The authors specified that the band intensity was quantified using the
ChemiScope 3400 Mini, the original intensity result (triplicates) should
be listed in the supplementary and unit (if arbitrary) of Y-axis should be
explained in Fig. 2 legend.
Response: Thanks for your valuable advice. The original intensity
results have been added in supplementary material. And Y-axis has now
been explained in Fig. 2 legend.
Sincerely,
Dr. Qi Zhang

Appendix C
Dear Editor,
RE: Ms. No. RSOB-18-0091.R2
We would like to thank you and the reviewers so much for the helpful
comments and valuable advices as well as the time and effort spent
reviewing our manuscript entitled "Abnormal arachidonic acid
metabolic network may reduce sperm motility via P38 MAPK". We
thank you so much for your editorial efforts.
1) We need you to explain the reason for the anomalies in the
background of the beta actin panels in Figures 2B and D. We have
attached our image auditors report. Please respond to it by uploading
your response in the 'response to referees'.
Image Report:
a. The p-P38 and the P38 blots look very similar in shape. The same
applies to the p-ERK1/2 and the ERK1/2 panels. The bands are almost
identical in shape. Is this feasible?
b. The ß-actin panel looks manipulated, the background appears to have
been erased. The areas are marked by red arrows. Uncharacteristically
sharp edges in the background are circled.
Response: Thank you for your valuable input.
a. In Figure 2B, the p-P38 and the P38, as well as the ERK and p-ERK,
actually were the same in shape. Because after protein bands of p-P38
were visualized by chemiluminescence method, the first antibodies and
secondary antibodies were removed from PVDF membrane by using
“stripping buffer”. The regenerated PVDF membrane was then blocked
by 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and react with P38 first antibody, respectively,
at 4 <U+2103> overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies were subsequently used to incubate and visualize the protein
bands by chemiluminescence method. The same applies to the p-
ERK1/2 and the ERK1/2 bands. Therefore, the protein bands of p-P38
and the P38, as well as ERK and p-ERK, were the same in shape.
b. The ß-actin panel looks manipulated. The gaps between P38 bands
were wider than those between original actin bands, because different
sizes of swim lanes were made. For the sake of intuition and
visualization, actin panel were manipulated, as shown in the figure
below. If the ß-actin bands in Figure 2 B and D need to be re-
manipulated, please let us know.
Please find original WB images without manipulation in Supplementary
Material.
2) You must clarify whether you no longer have the original uncut blots
available for inspection?
Response: The original protein bands were uploaded as
Supplementary Data (Original images of western blot results included
in Fig 2.) which can be used for inspection.
As described in the manuscript, in our WB experiments, the protein
samples are separated by vertical electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE.
The approximate position of target protein band is determined by pre-
stained protein marker. The gel was then cut and transferred onto a
PVDF membrane, which was then blocked by 5% nonfat milk for 1 h
and react with first antibodies at 4 <U+2103> overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibodies were subsequently used to incubate
and visualize the protein bands by chemiluminescence method.
After the protein band was cut and transferred from the gel onto the
PVDF membrane, all subsequent operations were performed with the
PVDF membrane, so the PVDF membrane was cut to the right size with
target protein band, and the gel was discarded after the protein was
transferred. Therefore Supplementary Data we uploaded were the
original WB images.
Please find detailed information and images of WB procedure in
Response to Referees.

Dr. Qi Zhang
