In this manuscript Nigg and colleagues describe new regulatory interactions of STIL, an essential
component of centriole biogenesis. In particular, using a non-biased proteomic approach by
comparing protein levels between control vs cullin inhibitor-treated samples, they find that STIL
is targeted for degradation by SCF-BetaTrCP via a conserved DSGXXD motif. Interestingly, this
domain is present in most vertebrates and mammals except for rodents, though absent in
invertebrates. SCF-BetaTrCP-mediated degradation of cytoplasmic STIL could be particularly
important to prevent excess centriole formation. In addition, the authors discover that CDK2
promotes both the localization and stability of STIL, a finding that could at least in part explain
the positive regulatory role the kinase is known to play in centrosome duplication. Altogether
this paper provides new insights into the regulation of centrosome duplication by revealing an
additional layer of control that acts on STIL.
The manuscript is clearly written and the data largely supports the conclusions. Although the
paper is based heavily on overexpression of transgenes, the experiments are carefully controlled
and the effects are large enough to provide meaningful results.
Specific points:
1. Fig 2F: according to the graph MLN4924 does not stabilize STILDAG and STILAAA, but based
on the blot, there appears to be an increase in the protein levels in both instances, which does not
simply reflect loading. In the text this is described as “at most minor additional accumulation
could be detected in response to the drug”. The FLAG signal appears to be saturated in lanes 4
and 6, which may limit the power of the calculations if performed on film-based blots (I was
unable to find the details how quantitation was performed). I wonder whether there is a blot that
is more representative of the graph shown, or whether the authors should leave open the
possibility that SCF inhibition could stabilize STIL by multiple means.
2. A simple and interesting test the authors should perform is to assess the effect of MLN4924 on
STIL in mouse cell lines.
3. Fig 4A: tet-induced GFP-STILDAG seems to stabilize endogenous STIL. It would be useful to
comment on this in the text.
4. Fig. 5B and E: it would be helpful to show quantification of signal, normalized against loading
control.
5. The part on CDK2 is interesting, but it remains unclear if STIL is a substrate of CDK2.
Considering that the phosphorylation on S395 can be detected in vivo, have the authors tried MS
to quantitate phosphorylation of STIL between MLN4924 only- and MLN4924+Roscovitine-
treated cells?
6. Although the raw proteomics data is not included in the paper, I hope that the authors will
3
deposit this in a public database as stated in the methods.
7. Fig. 1C: correct Thymdine to Thymidine
8. It is an attractive idea that there could be a link between differential regulation of STIL and
zygotic centriole inheritance in humans and rodents. The sentence in the discussion is however
very vague, and would clearly benefit from an additional few lines.

Tha article by Arquint and colleagues: ‘The SKP1-CULLIN-F-BOX E3 LIGASE ßTrCP AND
CDK2 COOPERATE TO CONTROL STIL ABUNDANCE AND CENTRIOLE NUMBER”
investigate the stability of the centriole duplication factor Stil. Past studies have shown that Stil is
a target of the APC/C. Here the authors show that Stil contains a motif recognised by ßtrcp and
that Stil binds SCF complexes. Further they show that inhibition of Stil- ßtrcp interaction results
in Stil stabilization and centrosome amplification.
This is an interesting studie that in agreement with other studies shows that the centriole
duplication factors are regulated by more than one E3 ligase. It would have been nice to include
more data related with ubiquitination and how the two complexes APC/C and SCF regulate Stil
levels along the cell cycle. Nevertheless, in his current state, this is an interesting article that will
be relevant to the centrosome field.
There are a few points worth considering in a revised version.
4
Major points:
1) The authors conclude that Stil degradation through ßtrcp takes place in the cytoplasm. They
base this conclusion by analysing western blot lysates from cells (Stil levels go down) and Stil
fluorescence intensity at the centrosomes by immunofluorescence (this is maintained). Can the
authors provide pictures that show the cytoplasm Stil localization and decrease in fluorescence
intensity?
Also, how did the authors analysed Stil levels at the centrosome? In the methods section they
mention that they subtracted the background intensity. Is this from a region outside the cell?
I am asking this question because if we consider that Stil cytoplasm intensity goes down, this
could, in principle, influence the recruitment of new Stil molecules at the centrosome during CHX
arrest. But apparently this is not the case. So, is it possible to interpret these observations in a
way that Stil at the centrosome, is not only protected from ßtrcp (as the authors did), but also
quite stably incorporated, like not exchanging with the cytoplasmic pool?
Still concerning this Figure 3H, if Stil is stabilized at the centrosome in CHX arrested cells, why
we only see 4 centrioles. We should expect centriole amplification, no? Not because Stil levels are
increased, but because these cells are arrested for many hours in S-phase.
2) In Figure 4 the authors show that cells expressing Stil mutants that are incompetent to bind
ßtrcp present centrosome amplification. This is also the case for Stil mutants that lack the Ken
box, which will mediate APC/C dependent ubiquitination, according to published results from
the same lab. How do the authors envisage the generation of centrosome amplification through
these two pathways of Stil stabilization that should be acting at different cell cycle stages? Maybe
this can be discussed in the discussion section?
3) The results showing that Roscovitine causes Stil WT degradation, but not any of the DAG or
AAA mutants are quite interesting. I am not a Roscovitine expert, but I am assuming that
Roscovitine is inhibiting both Cdk1 and Cdk2, no? Why do the authors only think that this is due
to Cdk2 inhibition? It would be important to show, at the cell level what happens to Stil at the
centrosome in Roscovitine treated cells, to understand whether the inaccessibility at the
centrosome mentioned above is dependent on Cdk activity. I think this is important so that we
can distinguish between a role in protecting from degradation at the centrosome or in
recruitment- according to the data presented in figure 6.
4) In figure 6 it appears that some of the panels in red do not correspond to the ones on grey. Like
Cp110 dots in grey appear bigger in the Stil Dag and WT than in red. Probably just a problem of
contrast, but worth correcting it..
Also, why in the case of p27 expression, Cp110 does not form a ring around pre-existing
centrioles in cells expressing StilWT or Stil Dag?
5) Can the authors maybe speculate on how they think that Cdk activity protects Stil from
ubiquitination? Are they assuming that it is depedent on the centrosome localization? This is
interesting since Plk4 is ubiquitinated by the same machinery and I think it is thought that it
occurs at the centrosome.
Minor points:
Misspelling- Thymidine- Figure 1
The model is difficult to follow, visually. Maybe the centrosome localised on the upper part will
help?
5
Maybe the authors want to mention the recent paper on Sas-5 in C.elegans and how mutations
that result in Sas-5 stabilization rescue the lack of duplication in the Zyg1 phenotype (PMID:
29030390).

Dear Editor,
Thank you very much for the positive feed-back on our manuscript. We were very
pleased that our manuscript has been accepted but also appreciate the opportunity
or a few minor revisions.
Below, please find our point-by-point reply to the referee’s comments.
We trust that the revised manuscript should now be ready for publication in Open
Biology. Once again, we would like to thank you and the editorial staff for handling

With best regards,

Referee #1: In this manuscript Nigg and colleagues describe new regulatory
nteractions of STIL, an essential component of centriole biogenesis. In particular,
using a non-biased proteomic approach by comparing protein levels between control
vs cullin inhibitor-treated samples, they find that STIL is targeted for degradation by
SCF-BetaTrCP via a conserved DSGXXD motif. Interestingly, this domain is present
n most vertebrates and mammals except for rodents, though absent in invertebrates.
SCF-BetaTrCP-mediated degradation of cytoplasmic STIL could be particularly
mportant to prevent excess centriole formation. In addition, the authors discover that
CDK2 promotes both the localization and stability of STIL, a finding that could at least
n part explain the positive regulatory role the kinase is known to play in centrosome
duplication. Altogether this paper provides new insights into the regulation of
centrosome duplication by revealing an additional layer of control that acts on STIL.
The manuscript is clearly written and the data largely supports the conclusions.
Although the paper is based heavily on overexpression of transgenes, the
experiments are carefully controlled and the effects are large enough to provide
meaningful results.
We thank this referee for his/her positive comments and support.
Specific points:
1. Fig 2F: according to the graph MLN4924 does not stabilize STILDAG and
STILAAA, but based on the blot, there appears to be an increase in the protein levels
n both instances, which does not simply reflect loading. In the text this is described
as “at most minor additional accumulation could be detected in response to the drug”.
The FLAG signal appears to be saturated in lanes 4 and 6, which may limit the power
of the calculations if performed on film-based blots (I was unable to find the details
how quantitation was performed).
We agree with this point and are certainly open to the possibility of ‘additional
egulation’. Hence, we have re-written the corresponding passage as follows:
Compared to transfected STIL WT, which was present at low levels but accumulated
strongly in response to MLN4924, both STIL DAG and STIL AAA were expressed at
higher levels, and only minor additional accumulation could be detected in response
o the drug. These results indicate that accumulation of STIL in response to
MLN4924 treatment results primarily, but not exclusively, from inhibition of STIL
degradation mediated by SCF-bTrCP acting through the DSG motif”.
Regarding the possible saturation of the signal, we note that quantification was
performed using CCD-based imaging, and care was taken to avoid saturated images
when measuring band intensities. This is now better explained in the Materials and
Methods section.
wonder whether there is a blot that is more representative of the graph shown, or
whether the authors should leave open the possibility that SCF inhibition could
stabilize STIL by multiple means.
We now show the same blot but with lower exposure settings. The conclusions
emain the same.
2. A simple and interesting test the authors should perform is to assess the effect of
MLN4924 on STIL in mouse cell lines.
We agree that this would be a potentially interesting experiment. Unfortunately,
however, our preliminary experiments revealed that our anti-STIL antibody does not
ecognize the mouse protein. Thus, it will not be possible for us to obtain data on
mouse cells within the time restrictions (imposed by lab closing). Importantly, we
emphasize that additional information from mouse cells – while interesting in its own
ight – would not influence the conclusions drawn in our manuscript about human
cells.
3. Fig 4A: tet-induced GFP-STILDAG seems to stabilize endogenous STIL. It would
be useful to comment on this in the text.
We have added a corresponding comment to the legend of Figure 4A.
4. Fig. 5B and E: it would be helpful to show quantification of signal, normalized
against loading control.
We now provide quantification normalized against loading control (see
Supplementary Figure 5C).
5. The part on CDK2 is interesting, but it remains unclear if STIL is a substrate of
CDK2. Considering that the phosphorylation on S395 can be detected in vivo, have
he authors tried MS to quantitate phosphorylation of STIL between MLN4924 only-
and MLN4924+Roscovitine-treated cells?
We had attempted the proposed mass-spectrometry-based quantification prior to
submission of the original manuscript, but, unfortunately, without success.
6. Although the raw proteomics data is not included in the paper, I hope that the
authors will deposit this in a public database as stated in the methods.
The data has been deposited in a public database and we now provide the accession
code in the Materials and Methods section.
7. Fig. 1C: correct Thymdine to Thymidine
Corrected - we thank the reviewer for spotting this typo.
8. It is an attractive idea that there could be a link between differential regulation of
STIL and zygotic centriole inheritance in humans and rodents. The sentence in the
discussion is however very vague, and would clearly benefit from an additional few
ines.
The sentence was deliberately left vague, because the proposed link between
differential regulation of STIL and zygotic centriole inheritance in humans and
odents is entirely speculative. In the absence of specific experiments addressing this
dea, we do not think that more extensive speculation would be warranted.
Referee #2: Tha article by Arquint and colleagues: ‘The SKP1-CULLIN-F-BOX E3
LIGASE ßTrCP AND CDK2 COOPERATE TO CONTROL STIL ABUNDANCE AND
CENTRIOLE NUMBER” investigate the stability of the centriole duplication factor Stil.
Past studies have shown that Stil is a target of the APC/C. Here the authors show
hat Stil contains a motif recognised by ßtrcp and that Stil binds SCF complexes.
Further they show that inhibition of Stil- ßtrcp interaction results in Stil stabilization
and centrosome amplification.
This is an interesting studie that in agreement with other studies shows that the
centriole duplication factors are regulated by more than one E3 ligase. It would have
been nice to include more data related with ubiquitination and how the two
complexes APC/C and SCF regulate Stil levels along the cell cycle. Nevertheless, in
his current state, this is an interesting article that will be relevant to the centrosome
ield.
There are a few points worth considering in a revised version.
Major points:
The authors conclude that Stil degradation through ßtrcp takes place in the
cytoplasm. They base this conclusion by analysing western blot lysates from cells
Stil levels go down) and Stil fluorescence intensity at the centrosomes by
mmunofluorescence (this is maintained). Can the authors provide pictures that show
he cytoplasm Stil localization and decrease in fluorescence intensity?
As shown previously (Bauer et al., 2016, EMBO J.), STIL is a very low abundance
protein. Thus, it is virtually impossible to reliably measure endogenous cytoplasmic
STIL by fluorescence microscopy.
Also, how did the authors analysed Stil levels at the centrosome? In the methods
section they mention that they subtracted the background intensity. Is this from a
egion outside the cell?
We have subtracted the background intensity adjacent to centrioles, hence in the
cytoplasm. As explained above, the bulk of cytoplasmic fluorescence represent
diffuse background staining rather than signal that could be attributed to cytoplasmic
STIL protein.
am asking this question because if we consider that Stil cytoplasm intensity goes
down, this could, in principle, influence the recruitment of new Stil molecules at the
centrosome during CHX arrest. But apparently this is not the case. So, is it possible
o interpret these observations in a way that Stil at the centrosome, is not only
protected from ßtrcp (as the authors did), but also quite stably incorporated, like not
exchanging with the cytoplasmic pool?
This is a good point. We now added a sentence (in the Results section) to address
his issue of ‘stable incorporation’: “Furthermore, these data also confirm that the bulk
of STIL is stably incorporated into centrioles (Moyer et al., 2015), restricting its
exchange with the cytoplasmic pool”.
Still concerning this Figure 3H, if Stil is stabilized at the centrosome in CHX arrested
cells, why we only see 4 centrioles. We should expect centriole amplification, no?
Not because Stil levels are increased, but because these cells are arrested for many
hours in S-phase.
t is correct that thymidine arrest causes centriole amplification in a fraction of U2OS
cells. However, this effect is time dependent, and after 24 hours of thymidine arrest,
only few cells show amplified centrioles. To facilitate measurements (and not
confound readers), these cells were ignored. Instead, for quantification of STIL we
ocused on cells containing two centrosomes. To make this clear, we added the
ollowing sentence to the Results section: “Although 24 hour thymidine arrest causes
some centrosome amplification in U2OS cells, we focused quantitative analyses on
he majority of cells showing normal centrosome numbers”.
2) In Figure 4 the authors show that cells expressing Stil mutants that are
ncompetent to bind ßtrcp present centrosome amplification. This is also the case for
Stil mutants that lack the Ken box, which will mediate APC/C dependent
ubiquitination, according to published results from the same lab. How do the authors
envisage the generation of centrosome amplification through these two pathways of
Stil stabilization that should be acting at different cell cycle stages? Maybe this can
be discussed in the discussion section?
We are not sure we fully understand what this referee would like us to discuss
urther. Our data (published here for b-TrCP regulation and published previously for
APC/C regulation) clearly show that accumulation of STIL above a certain threshold
causes centriole amplification. From the literature, it is also clear that the two ligases
show different activity profiles during the cell cycle, although these profiles may well
overlap. Most importantly, the pathways described here (and previously) are not
meant to cause centriole amplification – this phenotype only arises as a
consequence of aberrant ligase activity or expression of mutant STIL proteins.
3) The results showing that Roscovitine causes Stil WT degradation, but not any of
he DAG or AAA mutants are quite interesting. I am not a Roscovitine expert, but I
am assuming that Roscovitine is inhibiting both Cdk1 and Cdk2, no? Why do the
authors only think that this is due to Cdk2 inhibition?
t is correct that Roscovitine inhibits both CDK2 and CDK1. We were well aware of
his and, therefore, also used SNS-032, a CDK2-specific compound. Importantly,
virtually identical results were obtained with Roscovitine and SNS-032.
t would be important to show, at the cell level what happens to Stil at the centrosome
n Roscovitine treated cells, to understand whether the inaccessibility at the
centrosome mentioned above is dependent on Cdk activity. I think this is important
so that we can distinguish between a role in protecting from degradation at the
centrosome or in recruitment- according to the data presented in figure 6.
We have explored the possibility that CDK activity might be required to protect
centrosome-associated STIL. However, we obtained no evidence to support this
hypothesis (as indicated by the fact that intensity of centrosome-associated STIL
signal did not detectably change in response to Roscovitine). In the absence of
additional work on the relationship between CDK2 and STIL, we prefer to not include
hese data.
4) In figure 6 it appears that some of the panels in red do not correspond to the ones
on grey. Like Cp110 dots in grey appear bigger in the Stil Dag and WT than in red.
Probably just a problem of contrast, but worth correcting it…
We suspect that the problem perceived by this referee relates to PDF representation.
n our original Figues we cannot recognize any problem.
Also, why in the case of p27 expression, Cp110 does not form a ring around pre-
existing centrioles in cells expressing StilWT or Stil Dag?
The reported result matches with expectation: expression of p27 inhibits the
ormation of multiple pro-centrioles and, therefore, no CP110 ring would be expected
o form around parental centrioles.
5) Can the authors maybe speculate on how they think that Cdk activity protects Stil
rom ubiquitination? Are they assuming that it is depedent on the centrosome
ocalization? This is interesting since Plk4 is ubiquitinated by the same machinery
and I think it is thought that it occurs at the centrosome.
We feel that we have adequately addressed this issue. In fact, we state: “Finally, we
eport the unanticipated observation that CDK2 activity interferes with SCF-bTrCP-
mediated STIL degradation. The precise mechanism underlying this antagonism
emains to be determined, but one possibility is that CDK2 directly phosphorylates
STIL, thereby interfering with recognition of STIL by bTrCP. In this context it is
nteresting that STIL was reported to bind the prolyl-isomerase PIN1 and that
phosphorylation-induced prolyl-isomerization has previously been shown to
antagonize bTrCP-mediated protein degradation. Alternatively, CDK2 might interfere
with SCF-bTrCP activity itself.“
Minor points:
Misspelling- Thymidine- Figure 1
Corrected.
The model is difficult to follow, visually. Maybe the centrosome localised on the upper
part will help?
We have carefully considered re-organizing this Figure, but ultimately decided to
eave it unchanged. We continue to feel that the Figure nicely summarizes the key
conclusions.
Maybe the authors want to mention the recent paper on Sas-5 in C.elegans and how
mutations that result in Sas-5 stabilization rescue the lack of duplication in the Zyg1
phenotype (PMID: 29030390).
