The manuscript by Stubenrauch et al provides a sound genomic analysis of fimbrial usher
proteins in Enterobacteriaceae, focusing on the model microorganisms Escherichia coli. The
manuscript again outlines (1) the tremendous diversity of E. coli fimbriae and (2) gives further
insight into the interaction of the interaction between usher C and the TAM (translocation
assembly module) machinery. Christopher Stubenrauch has only recently proven how important
TAM is for productive assembly of fimbriae. A third focus of this manuscript is an insight into
the spread of usher proteins – based on genomic analyses – through E. coli by horizontal gene
transfer (HGT).
The manuscript is well written and the experiments are convincing. This reviewer has only minor
topics to address
1. Fig. and legends:
- Fig 1: how was the existence of monophyletic groups statistically proven? No information is
given in the Mat Meth section. Please explain
- Fig 2 is really hard to read. While the outer circles can be easily recognized and understood, the
inner tree is just much too small to be informative. What information is given by the thousands of
dots in between? Would a dendrogram be more informative than the circular tree?
2. Met Meth: were the pulse chase expression experiment done in triplicate – no information in
the Meth + Meth? If not please repeat the experiments.
3. Pulse chase data:
- The expression differences are not that high as at least this reviewer had expected. As stated by
Stubenrauch et al.(12016) “… that other types of outer membrane proteins will also be substrates
for the TAM….”. Given that this is the case, and showing that the usher C expression is
dependent on the respective TAM – is it possible by bioinformatics analyses to proof that which
TAM was horizontally acquired together with the usher and which were not? I am not sure
whether I fully understand the implication of the functional experiments: I guess the authors
hypothesize that each time a whole operon is horizontally acquired. But if not? Can they show by
bioinformatic analyses which of the analyzed UshC and YraJ were actually horizontally acquired
and which were not?
- Is it possible that the pulse chase experiments are influenced by the existence of other types of
OMP that might also be transported by the TAM under investigation? Please explain why this
should not be the case.
- is it possible that gene regulatory aspects have an influence on the outcome of the pulse chase
experiments? Please discuss.

The manuscript by Stubenrauch et al. presents a comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of the
chaperone-usher system in E. coli strains and Enteriobacteriaceae family. The authors speculate
that TAM machinery may play an important role on the LGT among bacterial strains and species
in getting new types of chaperon-usher. They also performed an expression experiments testing
the assembly of heterologous ushers in wild-type and delta TAM strains. Together, their
hypothesis on TAM machinery being a selection advantage in acquiring new chaperon-ushers is
very exciting but I found little support for such claim in that experiment. What it shows is just
that orthologous proteins require orthologous folding machinery. I simply dont see a connection
between the bioinformatics of the chaperone usher systems distribution and the function of TAM
machinery. This must be better justified for accepting the manuscript for publication.
notes:
I appreciate the quality of the bioinformatics especially when analysing such confused situation,
however, I find figure 2 and 3 excessive for the general readers. The overall design is, in my
opinion, not helping to get other information than many LGTs have occurred and the situation is
somewhat complicated.
the clustering analysis at Figure 4B should be better presented, half of the field is empty.

An interesting, short manuscript exploring how the influence of host cell biochemistry can in
some instances facilitate effective lateral gene transfer and application of the laterally transferred
gene product. It is a manuscript with potential to appeal to a broad readership, most obviously
bacteriologists, but also evolutionary biology and, given its biomedical relevance, those working
in the medical arena. However, I found it a difficult manuscript to navigate; far too difficult given
it is short and is focused upon two (appropriate and complex) analyses. In my view, it is too
direct in the writing and the most important conclusions to draw do not come out fully,
currently.
Other comments to attend to:
1. Line 28 Is ‘Enterobacteriaceae’ supposed to be italicised?
2. Line 37-40 The sentence here is very clunky, if not grammatical incorrect and then the final
sentence links TAM and LGT without any previous context. This makes the abstract far harder to
read and the broader relevance of the manuscript far hard to appreciate than it need be.
3. Line 60 virulence trait rather than ‘virulence factor’?
4. Line 115 I don’t read that the LGT events favour the retention of TAM machinery in some
bacteria. Rather, doesn’t the retention of TAM potentially facilitate ‘fixed’ LGT of genes encoding
membrane proteins. Again the manuscript feels harder to read than it need do.
5. Line 251 This sentence needs to close with the relevant reference(s).
6. A note on the generation of the TamA and TamB deletion mutants is appropriate. Is deletion of
both TamA and TamB lethal?
7. A general figure showing the appearance of fimbrae and the interaction of TAM with usher
and/or the interaction of usher with other proteins may be helpful for the general reader?

Comments of Editor / Board Member:
I agree with the general comments that the figures and writing can be made to be more accessible
for a more general audience. The figures, in particular, should be modified to enhance
readability. For acceptance, the author should directly address:
1. the technical comments about the pulse-chase experiments
2. include more details about the analytical methods
3. comment on the concerns regarding the hypothesis linking the usher systems and TAM
machinery. I believe this point will become clearer if the first two points are addressed.

through E. coli by horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
The manuscript is well written and the experiments are convincing. This reviewer has only
minor topics to address
1. Fig. and legends:
- Fig 1: how was the existence of monophyletic groups statistically proven? No information
is given in the Mat Meth section. Please explain
The tree was assessed manually, and visual monophyletic groups derived as a single
branching event from the ancestor were coloured accordingly. This description is now
included in the Figure legend.
- Fig 2 is really hard to read. While the outer circles can be easily recognized and
understood, the inner tree is just much too small to be informative. What information is
given by the thousands of dots in between? Would a dendrogram be more informative than
the circular tree?
Figures 2 and 4 have been modified for better readability as suggested.
2. Met Meth: were the pulse chase expression experiment done in triplicate – no
information in the Meth + Meth? If not please repeat the experiments.
The experiments were performed in triplicates, which is now outlined clearer in the Figure
legend.
3. Pulse chase data:
- The expression differences are not that high as at least this reviewer had expected. As
stated by Stubenrauch et al.(12016) “… that other types of outer membrane proteins will
also be substrates for the TAM….”. Given that this is the case, and showing that the usher C
expression is dependent on the respective TAM – is it possible by bioinformatics analyses to
proof that which TAM was horizontally acquired together with the usher and which were
not? I am not sure whether I fully understand the implication of the functional experiments:
I guess the authors hypothesize that each time a whole operon is horizontally acquired. But
if not? Can they show by bioinformatic analyses which of the analyzed UshC and YraJ were
actually horizontally acquired and which were not?
The expression system E. coli was used for all three proteins. Even though the fimbrial
operons are mobile in general, and their evolutionary history does not follow linear descent,
their spread in several related taxa (e.g. several E. coli strains, as well as closely related
Enterobacter and Yersinia) indicates that they have resided in the respective genomes before
these taxonomic groups diversified, and we therefore assume for them to have been fixed in
the genomes for some time, and their expression in E. coli can therefore be considered recent
HGT, even though they are not part of the core gene set of e.g. Yersinia and Enterobacter.
- Is it possible that the pulse chase experiments are influenced by the existence of other
types of OMP that might also be transported by the TAM under investigation? Please
explain why this should not be the case.
The pulse chase experiment includes a rifampicin blocking step which blocks native
transcription, and hence the amount of protein being produced is comprised almost entirely
of the gene of interest (because the non-native T7 RNA polymerase is not inhibited by
rifampicin, but remains entirely specific to the T7 promoter, found only upstream of the
target genes); other outer membrane proteins interacting with the TAM and causing
interference is therefore highly unlikely.
Whether the TAM is involved in the assembly of another OMP that is instead directly
involved in the assembly of the protein of interest (i.e. the TAM is only involved in the
assembly of the ushers indirectly), this is unlikely given the close relationship of TAM to the
well-described beta-barrel assembly machinery BAM; direct functional interaction is further
strengthened by recent reports demonstrating an interaction between TAM and its
substrates selectively (Bamert et al 2017 Molecular Microbiology DOI: 10.1111/mmi.13757).
- is it possible that gene regulatory aspects have an influence on the outcome of the pulse
chase experiments? Please discuss.
The knockout deletion of the TAM machinery has no influence on growth, OM topology, OM
composition and OM permeability (measured via membrane-targeting antibiotics)
(Stegmeier et al., 2007 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17214547]; Selkrig et al.,
2012 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22466966]); this is therefore highly unlikely.

1. Line 28 Is ‘Enterobacteriaceae’ supposed to be italicised?
This has now been reworded to clarify the expression refers to the taxonomic family.
2. Line 37-40 The sentence here is very clunky, if not grammatical incorrect and then the
final sentence links TAM and LGT without any previous context. This makes the abstract far
harder to read and the broader relevance of the manuscript far hard to appreciate than it
need be.
We have now significantly expanded the end of the Introduction to clarify the inferred role of
the TAM machinery in the folding of large, likely HGT-acquired adhesins, in a timely fashion.
We furthermore shortened the sentences in the respective part of the text for better
readability.
3. Line 60 virulence trait rather than ‘virulence factor’?
This has been amended as suggested.
4. Line 115 I don’t read that the LGT events favour the retention of TAM machinery in some

encoding membrane proteins. Again the manuscript feels harder to read than it need do.
As mentioned above (point 2), we have now significantly expanded the end of the
Introduction to clarify the inferred role of the TAM machinery.
5. Line 251 This sentence needs to close with the relevant reference(s).
We have now included the reference to the relevant figure (figure 2).
6. A note on the generation of the TamA and TamB deletion mutants is appropriate. Is
deletion of both TamA and TamB lethal?
Mutants of tamA, tamB and tamA-tamB are all viable. The mutants were described in a
previous publication, which is cited in the text (also see response to referee 1 question 3,
point 3; as well as lines 94/95 in the introduction).
7. A general figure showing the appearance of fimbrae and the interaction of TAM with
usher and/or the interaction of usher with other proteins may be helpful for the general
reader?
This has now been included as new Figure 6, providing a schematic overview of the stepwise
interactions.

Figures 2 and 4 have been modified for better visual representation as suggested (see also
Reviewer 1). We feel that Figure 3 is relevant and detailed to a sufficient extent for this
manuscript, but Figure 2 has been redesigned for an easier accessibility. All tree files are
available on Figshare as indicated in the text, and can therefore be viewed in all standard
tree viewing programs that enable e.g. zooming into specific regions of interest.
