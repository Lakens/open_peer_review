Tales of tails in transporters
The manuscript reviews the state of the art with respect to the role of N and C-terminal regions in
terms of transporter structure and function. These roles are emerging and the current paper, if
edited somewhat, will be a useful addition to the current literature in this area. The figures are
good quality and help to highlight key issues covered in the manuscript. My major issue with the
manuscript is that it is far too long and relatively unfocused. There are lengthy descriptions of
aspects of transporter biology that are not directly relevant to the key subject of the manuscript
that distract from the topic being discussed. A substantial reduction in the length of the
manuscript will make this easier to read and be more in keeping with the title of the paper.
In addition, the manuscript could do with an English edit.
Comments:
Page 2 Emphasis should be made at the start of the manuscript that the focus is secondary active
transporters. A single mention of ABC transporters is made further down the page and this
hardly seems relevant in this manuscript.
Page 2 Para 2 Line 22 Should really cite Forrest et al, 2011 here also.
Pages 3-4 Include a lengthy description of the different families of transproters. This could be cut
down to just focus on the differences in the tail regions.
Pg 5 5th from last line. The text states that a specific motif might be critical for oligomerisation of
UapA. What is the evidence for this?
Page 9-13 I think this could either be cut down or additional sections addeded
Page 13-14 Could dramatically cut down on the second paragraph in section 5. Only critical
sentence is last one “Emerging evidence supports that the N- and … “
MD is referred to throughout the manuscript as “showing” things. I would prefer the word
“indicate”
Pg 16-17 Again another very long section. Should make more concise to focus on the points
relevant to function of the tail region.
3
Pg 18-19 The section on olgiomerisation has a very long introduction-could be summarised in a
couple of sentences citing the Alguel and Cecchetti reviews.
Pg 19-20 The relevance of lipid interactions should be only the tail regions.
Pg 20 Last paragraph is very vague-should be really factual focusing on known material.

This review is original as it covers a relevant and emerging topic about membrane transporters
that has not been considered for a review article until now. The submitted article thus certainly
fills a gap. But the review is very long, and it includes so many details that it is often difficult to
read them extensively. For this reason, the review will be mostly useful to the small community
of scientists directly involved in the study of transporter tails.
The authors should pay much more attention to the references they cite. I will not list here all the
inappropriate citations I have found, as it would need too much work and time.
The first sentence of the abstract is problematic. It states that cell signaling is mediated by
4
transporters, which is obviously wrong. Some transporters indeed have signaling properties, but
the proposed sentence has a different meaning.
I’m also intrigued by the first sentence of Introduction. The authors claim that the activity of
transporters is essential for cell division and cell differentiation. What did the authors mean is
unclear, as I don’t know of any transporter shown to be essential for cell division. The authors
also seem to ignore in this first sentence that small ions are frequent substrates of transporters.
More generally, they should define more precisely what is the exact scope of the review, namely
what is their definition of a transporter (are ion carriers excluded?), as this term is sometimes
used by experts to qualify any transport protein including channels. In the next paragraphs, it
appears that the authors focus on transport proteins undergoing conformational changes to
translocate substrates across the membrane, excluding transport ATPases. This should be stated
at the beginning of the review.
The review deals with transporters from different organisms, with a special emphasis on fungal
transporters. But some general statements are only correct in the framework of a particular group
of species. For instance, the sentence Recycling involves the maturation of post-endocytic early
endosomes to recycling or sorting endosomes, and can also involve retrograde sorting to the
trans-Golgi network (TGN), and from there re-routing back to the PM in conventional or
transporter-specific Secretory Vesicles at p 11 is valid for mammalian cells, but certainly not for
yeast (see eg. The recent work of B Glick published in 2018 in Dev Cell).
p. 5. This sentence is unclear : "This sequence proved to be redundant for transporter folding or
function (Keener and Babst, 2013; Papadaki et al., 2018), ".. What does "redundant" mean here ?
p. 7. In this sentence, is « other » necessary ? "Additionally to the presence of short sequence
motifs, experimental evidence or ab initio structural predictions have suggested that the N- and
C-termini of NSS contain partially conserved folds that seem to be extremely important for
function, via their interaction with each other and other cytosolic loops of the main body of the
NSS transporters "
p. 7, 8 : the authors don’t use the common term “translocon”, they rather use “translocase protein
channel » and « translocate complex », which seem less commonly used and less accurate.
p. 8. For the sentence "… the ribosomes which translate transporters or other membrane proteins
“need” to attach to the translocase complex in the ER .. " : ribosomes don’t translate proteins, they
translate mRNAs.
p. 8. ".. the COPII adaptor coat protein Sec24 or its paralogues .." : would « homologs » not be
more appropriate ?
p. 9 : Regarding the sentence " Rather surprisingly, no mutation or condition has been shown to
block PM transporters in the Golgi or in other post-ER compartment (secretory vesicles or
endosomes). It seems that specific, de novo made, transporters, such as the CFTR channel
involved in cystic fibrosis or the UapA purine transporter, exit the ER in COPII vesicles, but
subsequent sorting steps involve an unconventional mechanism of trafficking that only requires
proper, clathrin heavy chain-dependent, actin organization (Yoo et al., 2002; Rabouille, 2017;
Bouris et al., 2019). ". The authors ignore important studies showing that some transporters
undergo sorting regulation at Golgi level, with a role of cytosolic tails in this sorting. This aspect
should also be covered by the review.
p. 9 : "Transporter ubiquitination is carried-out by HECT-type ubiquitin ligases of the
Nedd4/Rsp5-type (Fang et al., 2014), recruited to transporter tails by adaptor proteins called a-
5
arrestins (Lin et al., 2008; Nikko and Pelham, 2009; MacGurn et al., 2012; Guiney et al., 2016;
Mund and Pelham, 2018) .." The cited reference Fang et al., 2014 is inadequate, and regarding the
adaptors, it would be fair to also cite the articles of S Leon and B Andre.
p. 17 : “What is however very interesting is that once these termini are “invented” during
evolution, .. " . This kind of statement (« invented ») is unaccceptable in a scientific article, even
between brackets.
p. 19 : "Other reports have shown that lipids other than phospholipids (PIP), in particular sterols,
seem to play important roles in the functioning of DAT .. " What does « PIP » mean here ?
p ; 20. "Recent crystal structures of DAT revealed the presence of two conserved cholesterol- like
molecules and relative MD simulations suggested that outward-facing DAT in the absence of
cholesterol DAT undergoes a conformational modification that mimics the transition to an
inward-facing conformation." This sentence is not properly formulated.
References should be cited after these sentences:
P. 3 Unlike functional domains essential for transport activity, transporter termini .. in
subcellular sorting, targeting, stability, cell-specific modification, or regulated turnover.
P.3 Same suggestion for the next sentence, in which an « of » should also be discarded.
P. 4 The additional two TMS are not involved directly in transport activity, and are believed to be
essential for the oligomerization status of APCs in vivo,
P. 4 For example, the N-termini of yeast APCs possess relatively short motifs and specific Lys
residues necessary for regulated turnover via ubiquitination, endocytic internalization, and
sorting in endosomes and vacuoles.
P. 8 It is more than obvious that such … .. lipid bilayer domains (Nie et al., 2018), processes also
important for ER-exit,
And a dot should finish the sentence.

The first sentence of the abstract is problematic. It states that cell signaling is mediated by
transporters, which is obviously wrong. Some transporters indeed have signaling properties,
but the proposed sentence has a different meaning.
Transporters can be essential in signaling, maybe not directly, but through the substrates they
transport. In some cases, as stated later, they can also be direct mediators of signaling (e.g.
transceptors), or sensors of the environment (the case of Aspergillus transporters during
germination). We do nott agree with the reviewer.
I’m also intrigued by the first sentence of Introduction. The authors claim that the activity of
transporters is essential for cell division and cell differentiation. What did the authors mean is
unclear, as I don’t know of any transporter shown to be essential for cell division.
Again we do not agree with the reviewer. What we mean is that without proper nutrient,
vitamin, etc., there is no cell division and in some cases in fungi no spore differentiation.
Starvation or uptake of xenobiotics can elicit alterations in differentiation etc. In anyway, we
removed cell division.
The authors also seem to ignore in this first sentence that small ions are frequent substrates of
transporters. More generally, they should define more precisely what is the exact scope of the
review, namely what is their definition of a transporter (are ion carriers excluded?), as this
term is sometimes used by experts to qualify any transport protein including channels.
We are definitely aware that “ions are frequent substrates of transporters”. Anyway, we
made clearer what kind of transporters this review discusses in the beginning of the revised
version.
In the next paragraphs, it appears that the authors focus on transport proteins undergoing
conformational changes to translocate substrates across the membrane, excluding transport
ATPases. This should be stated at the beginning of the review.
Revised accordingly, see answer above.
The review deals with transporters from different organisms, with a special emphasis on
fungal transporters. But some general statements are only correct in the framework of a
particular group of species. For instance, the sentence Recycling involves the maturation of
post-endocytic early endosomes to recycling or sorting endosomes, and can also involve
retrograde sorting to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and from there re-routing back to the
PM in conventional or transporter-specific Secretory Vesicles at p 11 is valid for mammalian
cells, but certainly not for yeast(see eg. The recent work of B Glick published in 2018 in Dev
Cell
Text revised to make the reviewer’s point clear.
p. 5. This sentence is unclear : "This sequence proved to be redundant for transporter folding
or function (Keener and Babst, 2013; Papadaki et al., 2018), ".. What does "redundant" mean
here ?
It means that mutations in this motif can affect substrate specificity (enlarge it, allowing
additional substrate to be recognized with low affinity), without affecting the kinetics of
transport of the physiological substrates, which in turn means that it does not affect the
overall folding of the transporter. This becomes clearer later, as indicated in the text.
p. 7. In this sentence, is « other » necessary? "Additionally to the presence of short sequence
motifs, experimental evidence or ab initio structural predictions have suggested that the N-
and C-termini of NSS contain partially conserved folds that seem to be extremely important
for function, via their interaction with eachother and other cytosolic loops of the main body of
the NSS transporters "
The word “other” deleted.
p. 7, 8 : the authors don’t use the common term “translocon”, they rather use “translocase
protein channel » and « translocate complex, which seem less commonly used and less
accurate.
“Translocon” used in the revised version
p. 8. For the sentence "… the ribosomes which translate transporters or other membrane
proteins “need” to attach to the translocase complex in the ER . " :ribosomes don’t translate
proteins, they translate mRNAs.
Changed to “ribosomes which synthesizes”
p. 8. ".. the COPII adaptor coat protein Sec24 or its paralogues .." : would «homologs » not
be more appropriate ?
Not really, as we wanted to emphasize that duplication of Sec24 has created paralogues that
mght have different cargo specificities.
p. 9 : Regarding the sentence " Rather surprisingly, no mutation or condition has been shown
to block PM transporters in the Golgi or in other post-ER compartment (secretory vesicles or
endosomes). It seems that specific, de novo made, transporters, such as the CFTR channel
involved in cystic fibrosis or the UapA purine transporter, exit the ER in COPII vesicles, but
subsequent sorting steps involve an unconventional mechanism of trafficking that only
requires proper, clathrin heavy chain-dependent, actin organization (Yoo et al., 2002;
Rabouille, 2017; Bouris et al., 2019). ". The authors ignore important studies showing that
some transporters undergo sorting regulation at Golgi level, with a role of cytosolic tails in
this sorting. This aspect should also be covered by the review.
We definitely do not ignore this issue but we have a different opinion. As this has been a big
issue for our lab, we have extensively reviewed the literature and found that in no case formal
proof exists show Jung that de novo made transporter pass through the Golgi. Transporter
sorting to the Golgi seems to concern transporter recycling back from the PM. This, we
believe, has caused a general misinterpretation concerning the use of conventional secretory
path for transport secretion. Indeed, we have performed multiple experiments and showed
that several Aspergillus transporters use a non-conventional secretory route. This can be seen
in a preprint of our work at BioRxiv (Bouris et al. 2019). Actually we are revising our work to
be resubmitted to EMBO J. We understand that this is a rather provoking finding that it is
hard others to buy it. We are doing our best to convince our colleagues that transporters
follow an unconventional path and we insist of presenting this concept in this review. The
whole subject of transporter sorting is however little related to the roles of tails so no more
information on the different paths is needed here.
p. 9 : "Transporter ubiquitination is carried-out by HECT-type ubiquitin ligases of the
Nedd4/Rsp5-type (Fang et al., 2014), recruited to transporter tails by adaptor proteins called
a-arrestins (Lin et al., 2008; Nikko and Pelham, 2009; MacGurn et al., 2012; Guiney et al.,
2016; Mund and Pelham, 2018)" The cited reference Fang et al., 2014 is inadequate, and
regarding the adaptors, it would be fair to also cite the articles of S Leon and B Andre.
The reviewer is absolutely right; we missed form the text articles of the two most important
groups of this subject. Added in the revised version.
p. 17 : “What is however very interesting is that once these termini are “invented” during
evolution, ." . This kind of statement (« invented ») is unaccceptable in ascientific article,
even between brackets.
Replaced with “created”
p. 19 : "Other reports have shown that lipids other than phospholipids (PIP), in particular
sterols, seem to play important roles in the functioning of DAT .. " What does « PIP » mean
here ?
Removed
p ; 20. "Recent crystal structures of DAT revealed the presence of two conserved cholesterol-
like molecules and relative MD simulations suggested that outward-facing DAT in the
absence of cholesterol DAT undergoes a conformational modification that mimics the
transition to an inward-facing conformation." This sentence is not properly formulated.
This sentence was rephrased to become clearer.
References should be cited after these sentences:
P. 3 Unlike functional domains essential for transport activity, transporter termini.. in
subcellular sorting, targeting, stability, cell-specific modification, or regulated turnover.

P.3 Same suggestion for the next sentence, in which an « of » should also be discarded.
Corrected
P. 4 The additional two TMS are not involved directly in transport activity, and are believed
to be essential for the oligomerization status of APCs in vivo,
Reference added
P. 4 For example, the N-termini of yeast APCs possess relatively short motifs and specific
Lys residues necessary for regulated turnover via ubiquitination, endocytic internalization,
and sorting in endosomes and vacuoles.
