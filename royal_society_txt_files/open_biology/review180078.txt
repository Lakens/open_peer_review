In this report the laboratory of Dr. Moscatelli continues to provide an extensive evidence for the
involvement of microtubules (MTs) in late endosome/prevacuolar comp. (PVC) dynamics. Major
innovation is the use of Arabidopsis PVC marker SNARE protein SYP21 – which unfortunately
also implies a question, if ectopic expression of this Arabidopsis (Rosids) marker in tobacco
(Asterids) pollen tubes might not affect this type of compartment. Tobacco pollen tube model is
also not amenable to the genetic analysis, so that pharmacology and cell fractionation is a major
experimental approach. It is a valuable contribution to the field, but results are over-interpreted,
large parts of the texts (esp. in the Introduction and Disc., but also Results) are kind of review not
discussing data reported here - so that text (and Figures too) should be extensively shortened/cut
back/streamlined.
Major criticism
- The conceptual problem not only with this, but already published reports is, that it mostly (i.e.
occasionally yes) does not directly deeply compare functions of MTs vs. F-actin in pollen tubes.
So that e.g. in this report an implicit message to the reader is that PVC trafficking to the vacuole
only! depends on MTs – i.e. F-actin is excluded. However these both types of cytoskeleton are
intimately interconnected, and at least experiments with GFP_SYP21 visualised PVC dynamics as
affected by anti-MTs drugs have to be compared with anti-F-actin drugs to avoid possible false
conclusion that only MTs are involved.
- As ectopic expression of SYP21 marker in tobacco pollen tubes might affect this type of
compartment (in fact induce it) it would be important to compare control pollen tubes expressing
only GFP with these ones – stained by acidic comp. marker to see if numbers and size of these
PVC/vacuolar compartments are not changed in pollen tubes expressing SYP21.
- In most experiments data on the effects of drugs on pollen tube elongation rate are missing.
- Equally it is not clear if all cytologically monitored pollen tubes are growing (e.g. Fig 9B does
not look as growing one).
- There is no possibility to conclude on PVC maturation – Wm experiments are also over-
interpreted and mere changes in compartment size/number are not strong enough data to
conclude on PVC maturation.
Minor points
As indicated – great chunks of text should be left out – esp. from Introd. and Disc. – and only
stuff directly related to the experimental data included. The 1st sentence of Intro do not need
reference and if so, it should refer to original observations of Navashin and Grignard; all of that
3
was discovered fair before 2001. All controls in Figs. should be moved to Suppl. and also Figures
should be reconsidered. E.g. full Fig. 7 could be left out without loss of information.
In the Introduction and Disc. authors should more sharply distinguish different endocytotic
pathways (as they described them before) vs. two different degradation pathways which are
much less characterized in previous reports. Also no direct substrate for degradation was
monitored.
Despite all this criticism I consider this report, after the text (and Figs.) streamlining (as indicated
above), as a valuable contribution to the field of pollen tube biology.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_3
The authors deliver several lines of evidence that SYP21 positive compartments are interacting
with microtubules giving a convincing story there. The further claims on the importance of MTs
for the trafficking from PVCs to vacuoles cannot be made based on the presented data using this
approach.
I have also concerns how the data is presented and how thoroughly the study was conducted. I
also think that the concerns of the previous reviewer concerning the marker protein used could
not be dispersed:
1. The data presented in Figure 1 is clearly anecdotal. How many images were recorded? How
many independent experiments (I think one would be enough here but this must be stated). What
is the percentage of association? For the reader it is not clear if the authors just show images of
tubules and organelles lying next to each other by chance, or if there is a clear association seen. It
would have clearly helped to include a control here (without AMP-PNP) to show that a real
association exists.
Statements like “are only occasionally observed” or “in some cases” without giving percentages
underlie the anecdotal nature of the data presentation.
2. There is a similar problem with figure 3s and 4E,F. What is the number of images. Where there
also SYP21 negative structures seen?
6
3. Figure 5 can be hardly assessed as there some grave problem occurred that removed most of
the labeling.
4. I do not think any real conclusions can be made from Figure 6A-C. As I see it n is equal to 1.
Also the bands that are compared should be loaded next to each other and not on separate gels.
5. How many similar images were taken for 7 A, D, E, F? On how many tubes is 7C based on?
How can the size of 0-0.1 nm and 0.1-0.2 nm be distinguished using a normal confocal
microscope?
6. I am also critical of the results shown in figure 8. It appears that the compartments are not
getting bigger by fusion (in fused organelles the fluorescence which is associated with the
membrane alone should only encircle the structures. I therefore think that the structures are
rather aggregated, an effect that is also seen by mere overexpression of the marker. This also
shows that this marker in general is not suitable or should be expressed at much lower levels
than presented.
On how many individually transformed tubes are the results based on?
7. Concerning figure 9 I and J, there is only one channel presented. How can there be
colocalization?
I also do not understand how the images could be observed by sequential scanning without
fixing the pollen tubes. All the organelles are highly mobile and change their localization in
seconds.
The fluorescence of CMAC seems to bleed into the YFP channel (tubular structures are much
more present in the yellow channel than in comparison to studies when CMAC was not used
(Figures 7, 8, 11) likely resulting in the high value for colocalization. The experiment should be
repeated with a red marker for SYP21, preferably one that does to tend to aggregate. This whole
colocalization study is not very convincing in my eyes as are the conclusions drawn from it.
8. Considering figure 11. Again I think this are aggregates of due to syp21 expression (maybe the
toxins increase aggregation by a pleiotropic effect). As syp21 binds the membrane of the vesicles,
larger vesicles should not have any fluorescence on the inside.
9. There are statistics missing for figure 12.
10. Sometimes I do not understand the strategy. The authors independently express YFP-SYP21
and GFP-BP80 and show that the localization looks similar and also the size of the organelles
stained. Ok, this might be some sort of weak evidence, but why dont the authors just coexpress
the proteins to show colocalization? Its an easy cloning step to exchange the fluorophor. Then the
plasmids can be simply mixed and used for particle bombardment.

This MS mainly showed the involvement of microtubules (MTs) in regulating trafficking to
tubular vacuoles in tobacco pollen tubes. Major findings include: 1) Microtubules is showed to
preferentially bind PVCs in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner; 2) SYP21 is found to be localized
on PVCs and tubular vacuoles in tobacco pollen tubes; and 3) Studies using different drugs
affecting the polymerization status of microtubules showed that different microtubules
populations play specific roles in PVC trafficking and in PVC delivery to and/or fusion with
tubular vacuoles in the apex/shank with respect to the distal regions.
Some comments:
1) It is known that motor proteins mediate vesicles (e.g. PVCs) transport along the filamentous
MTs. The PVCs are believed to transport from TGN to the vacuole along MTs. The conclusion of
this study is not novel, but the in vitro experiment design is interesting. Figure 1 showed that
Taxol-purified MTs could bind to microsomes (including PVCs) in vitro. Based on Figure 1F and
G only, it is very hard to conclude that small particles (that are associated with MT-bound
vesicles such as PVCs) mediated the interaction between MTs and vesicles. The small particles
could be tiny vesicles or protein complex. More evidences or related discussions are needed to
address this question.
2) In Figure 2, SYP21 antibody is used as the only PVC marker. Since SYP21 also showed tubular
vacuole pattern as shown in this study, it would be more convincing to include additional PVC
marker (like VSR) in Figure 2 to prove that the MTs could bind PVCs instead of tubular vacuoles.
3) What is the nature of SYP21-postive tubular vacuoles? Are they intermediate compartments
between PVC and the vacuole or only the accumulation of PVCs owing to SYP21overexpression?
4) Figure 9: The chemical dye, CMAC was used to label the vacuoles, however, the strong cytosol
pattern of this dye could also be observed. The colocalization between CMAC and YFP-SYP21
may not be precise enough. Coexpression of the vacuole membrane marker like RFP-VAMP711,
with YFP-SYP21 or YFP-VSR would be a better choice to demonstrate their colocalization.
5) Based on the current data, one can only make a conclusion that the PVCs travelled via MTs,
without indicating the direction of movement (TGN to vacuole or the opposite?) The in vivo
dynamic study could be useful to address this point.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
In this report the laboratory of Dr. Moscatelli continues to provide an extensive
evidence for the involvement of microtubules (MTs) in late endosome/prevacuolar
comp. (PVC) dynamics. Major innovation is the use of Arabidopsis PVC marker
SNARE protein SYP21 - which unfortunately also implies a question, if ectopic
expression of this Arabidopsis (Rosids) marker in tobacco (Asterids) pollen tubes
might not affect this type of compartment. Tobacco pollen tube model is also not
amenable to the genetic analysis, so that pharmacology and cell fractionation is a
major experimental approach. It is a valuable contribution to the field, but results are
over-interpreted, large parts of the texts (esp. in the Introduction and Disc., but also
Results) are kind of review not discussing data reported here - so that text (and
Figures too) should be extensively shortened/cut back/streamlined.
Major criticism
- The conceptual problem not only with this, but already published reports is, that it
mostly (i.e. occasionally yes) does not directly deeply compare functions of MTs vs.
F-actin in pollen tubes. So that e.g. in this report an implicit message to the reader is
that PVC trafficking to the vacuole only! depends on MTs - i.e. F-actin is excluded.
However these both types of cytoskeleton are intimately interconnected, and at least
experiments with GFP_SYP21 visualised PVC dynamics as affected by anti-MTs
drugs have to be compared with anti-F-actin drugs to avoid possible false
conclusion that only MTs are involved.
We are very sorry that it seemed that we did not consider the fundamental
role of actin filaments in membrane traffic. In the past we also published a paper
(Moscatelli et al., 2012; Plant Biol. 14: 770–782. doi: 10.1111/j.1438-
8677.2011.00547.x) reporting data on the role of actin filaments on PM
internalization in tobacco pollen tubes. For this study we actually recognized that in
tobacco pollen tubes the use of Latrunculin B induce a relevant effect in the
distribution pattern of MTs in the shank and tip. In these regions short randomly
oriented MT strands, typical of control cells, changed into long bundles helically
oriented and encapsulating the tip (see also Moscatelli et al. 2012). For this reason,
the use of latB in Nicotiana tabacum pollen tube does not unambiguously show the
effect of AFs perturbation only. This aspect was discussed in the paper. However,
although the use of MTs affecting drugs do not apparently affect AFs distribution
and dynamics, as reported also in the paper, since MTs and AFs strictly interact, an
impact of AFs on endosome traffick cannot be excluded. In this view, please also
note that the title was changed in order to indicate a participation of MTs in
endosome trafficking. (Results, pg: 11, lane 246-247; pg: 15, lanes 349-357 and
Fig. S5H,I; Discussion, pg: 18, lane 430; Pg: 22, lanes 522-527; pg: 23, lanes
559-569; Pg: 24-25, lanes 585-600; pg: 26, lanes 631-632).
As ectopic expression of SYP21 marker in tobacco pollen tubes might affect this
type of compartment (in fact induce it) it would be important to compare control
pollen tubes expressing only GFP with these ones – stained by acidic comp. marker
to see if numbers and size of these PVC/vacuolar compartments are not changed in
pollen tubes expressing SYP21.
Attempts to stain endosomes without using plasmids (SYP21 or BP80) were
done by using Acridine orange on LAT52-YFP transformed pollen tube.
Simultaneous treatment led to pollen tube death or burst. We did not use dyes
staining acidic compartment (i.e. Lysosensor) since, as reported in plants, late
endosomes have a neutral content (Martinière A, Bassil E, Jublanc E, et al. In vivo
intracellular pH measurements in tobacco and Arabidopsis reveal an unexpected pH
gradient in the endomembrane system. The Plant Cell. 2013;25:4028-4043.
doi:10.1105/tpc.113.116897).
To further show that localization of SYP21 in transformed pollen tube was specific
and that that transformation did not induce modification of vacuolar apparatus we
performed a CMAC staining of LAT52-YFP transformed pollen tube (Fig. S6 A-F;
Results pg: 13, lanes 288-290; pg: 14, lanes 320-325; Mat and Meth, pg: 30-31,
lanes 747-754).
- In most experiments data on the effects of drugs on pollen tube elongation rate are
missing. Equally it is not clear if all cytologically monitored pollen tubes are
growing (e.g. Fig 9B does not look as growing one).
Growth rate for all treatments were inserted in the text and shown in Fig. S3
A. In addition we added in the text growth rate of BP 80 and LAT52-YFP
transformed pollen tube: Results pg: 12, lane 272-273; pg: 13, line 289-291. The
pollen tube showed in Fig 9B is a growing pollen tube.
- There is no possibility to conclude on PVC maturation - Wm experiments are also
over-interpreted and mere changes in compartment size/number are not strong
enough data to conclude on PVC maturation.
We agree with the referee and the interpretation of data was changed
accordingly. In particular see Results, pg: 14, lanes 331-334; Discussion, pg: 24,
lanes 574-577 and lanes 578-584; pg: 24-25, lanes 585-600.
Minor points
As indicated - great chunks of text should be left out - esp. from Introd. and Disc. -
and only stuff directly related to the experimental data included.
An extensive editing of the text has been done. Changes have been done in
intoduction, results and discussion as suggested.
The 1st sentence of Intro do not need reference and if so, it should refer to original
observations of Navashin and Grignard; all of that was discovered fair before 2001.
The references were added: Introduction, Pg: 3, line 36.
All controls in Figs. should be moved to Suppl. and also Figures should be
reconsidered. E.g. full Fig. 7 could be left out without loss of information.
Fig. S7 has been removed. All the controls are in the supplementary figures.
In the Introduction and Disc. authors should more sharply distinguish different
endocytotic pathways (as they described them before) vs. two different degradation
pathways which are much less characterized in previous reports. Also no direct
substrate for degradation was monitored.
This work should be considered as the starting point to better characterize
two degradative pathways that we described in previous paper. Further experiments
comprising FM4-64 and charged nanogold, together with transient transformation
approaches were planned for the near future.
Despite all this criticism I consider this report, after the text (and Figs.) streamlining
(as indicated above), as a valuable contribution to the field of pollen tube biology.
We hope that the quality of the paper is now adequate for publication in Open
Biology.

Appendix B
Response to Referees
The manuscript was modified according to suggestions; modified parts of the
manuscript are in red.
Referee: 2
The authors deliver several lines of evidence that SYP21 positive compartments are
interacting with microtubules giving a convincing story there. The further claims on
the importance of MTs for the trafficking from PVCs to vacuoles cannot be made
based on the presented data using this approach.I have also concerns how the data is
presented and how thoroughly the study was conducted. I also think that the
concerns of the previous reviewer concerning the marker protein used could not be
dispersed:
1. The data presented in Figure 1 is clearly anecdotal. How many images were
recorded? How many independent experiments (I think one would be enough here
but this must be stated). What is the percentage of association?
As suggested, the number of experiments and of images considered for TEM
analysis were inserted in Material and Methods: pg 30, lines 736-739. The
percentage of association of organelles to MTs is now reported in Results: pg. 5,
line 103.
For the reader it is not clear if the authors just show images of tubules and organelles
lying next to each other by chance, or if there is a clear association seen. It would
have clearly helped to include a control here (without AMP-PNP) to show that a real
association exists.
Actually, the control for binding experiments was already included in the
manuscript (see in the Results pg. 8, underlined lines 165-167 and pg. 7, underlined
lane 145). We also modified the sentence pg. 6, lines 115-116. In Fig 4 and Fig 5
(stripping and ATP experiments respectively) we observed that without AMP-PNP
the percentage of organelle bound to MTs decreases (Fig 5D). As expected, the use
of AMP-PNP induces a stable binding of organelles that interact with MTs in an
ATP dependent manner. AMP-PNP has been largely used to purify MT motor
proteins from a wide range of organisms, including tobacco pollen tubes (RFS). For
this reason we think that our data suggest the ATP-dependent binding of SYP21
positive organelles to MTs. On the contrary, after surface protein stripping the
percentage of organelles bound to MTs increases considerably (Fig 4D), suggesting
that the binding of organelles to MTs in control was not aspecific or accidental. We
carried out two experiments without AMP-PNP and the percentage of organelles
associated with MTs was very low (about 5%) since the binding was not stabilized
by AMP-PNP or mediated by ATP-dependent proteins. A sentence was inserted in
Material and Methods pg 29, line 729 and in the Results: pg. 6, lines 111-112. In
addition, the preferential binding with SYP21 organelles was evidenced in western
blot experiments (Fig. 2) confirming the ability of MTs to bind specific organelles.
Statements like “are only occasionally observed” or “in some cases” without giving
percentages underlie the anecdotal nature of the data presentation.
We inserted the quantitative information; pg. 5, lines 105, 109. We modified
the sentences pg. 5/6, lines 109-111.
2. There is a similar problem with figure 3s and 4E,F. What is the number of images.
We inserted in Material and Methods the number of experiments and images
taken for TEM analysis: pg 30, lines 736-739.
Where there also SYP21 negative structures seen?
We observed SYP21 negative structures and we inserted information into the
text: pg. 6, lines 134-135.
3. Figure 5 can be hardly assessed as there some grave problem occurred that
removed most of the labeling.
We are sorry for the mistake something happened during the pdf conversion
and we did not notice. Now the fig should be fine
4. I do not think any real conclusions can be made from Figure 6A-C. As I see it n is
equal to 1.
Fractionation experiments were repeated three times (see material and
methods pg 30, lines 749-750).
Also the bands that are compared should be loaded next to each other and not on
separate gels.
Our gel systems allow to load 10 lanes per gels and the use of three different
gels was indispensable. Standards for molecular mass were loaded in each gel.
5. How many similar images were taken for 7 A, D, E, F? On how many tubes is 7C
based on?
We inserted the information in Materials and Methods pg.32, lines 795-799.
We also inserted information for colocalization experiments in Materials and
Methods pg.33, lines 821-823.
How can the size of 0-0.1 nm and 0.1-0.2 nm be distinguished using a normal
confocal microscope?
The dimensions reported for SYP21 organelles in Fig 7C, were not diameters
but areas (µm2, not nm). The diameter of very small organelles (50 nm) was
estimated by TEM observations (see results).
6. I am also critical of the results shown in figure 8. It appears that the compartments
are not getting bigger by fusion (in fused organelles the fluorescence which is
associated with the membrane alone should only encircle the structures.
I therefore think that the structures are rather aggregated, an effect that is also seen
by mere overexpression of the marker.
The staining encircling the organelles is observed when the images are taken
in the central focal plane. When we observe the focal plane tangential to the
organelles the surface appears completely covered by SYP21 staining. Since our
observations were made in live cells, the rapid movements of organelles do not
allow to choose the central focal plane rather than the tangential plane. However,
careful observation of our images allowed us to observe YFP-SYP21 surface
labelling of PVCs. We inserted in Fig. 8 an image showing PVCs with SYP21
decorating the delimiting membrane. The correspondent description was inserted in
the Results pg.12, lines 266-267 and in Figure caption (Fig. 8).
In the overexpression, both large and little aggregates appeared clearly
formed by clusters of vesicles (Fig 7E showed aggregates of different dimensions
which appeared formed by little vesicles close to each other). On the contrary, in
Wm treated pollen tubes large compartments appeared as uniform structures and so
very different from those observed in overexpression (compare Fig 7 and Fig. 8).
This also shows that this marker in general is not suitable or should be expressed at
much lower levels than presented.
We tested growing plasmid concentrations and the lowest concentration that
allows to observe SYP21 staining was chosen (see Results pg 10, lines 232-234).
On how many individually transformed tubes are the results based on?
The answer is reported in the Point 5.
7. Concerning figure 9 I and J, there is only one channel presented. How can there
be colocalization?
To avoid the insertion of a new figure, we reported only the images showing
the colocalization points. In order to complete the report of data, we decided to
insert a new supplementary figure (Fig. S8, reporting all the images showing YFP
and CMAC channels, colocalization points and bright fields. In the new Fig S8 both
control and Ory-treated pollen tubes were reported (Results: pg 15, lines 350-351
and pg 17/18, lines 417-419). Figure caption was also inserted.
I also do not understand how the images could be observed by sequential scanning
without fixing the pollen tubes. All the organelles are highly mobile and change their
localization in seconds.
The images were taken by using the sequential scan mode of the LCS
software (between lanes) and aligned by Leica LASx software. Information was
inserted in Material and Methods: pg.33; line 811.
The fluorescence of CMAC seems to bleed into the YFP channel (tubular structures
are much more present in the yellow channel than in comparison to studies when
CMAC was not used (Figures 7, 8, 11) likely resulting in the high value for
colocalization. The experiment should be repeated with a red marker for SYP21,
preferably one that does to tend to aggregate. This whole colocalization study is not
very convincing in my eyes as are the conclusions drawn from it.
We inserted a supplemental figure (Fig. S4) showing the crosstalk
experiments between YFP-SYP21 and blue-CMAC. A comment to figure was
reported in Results: pg 15, lines 342-343 and the figure caption. Details of crosstalk
procedure are reported in the caption of Fig.S4.
8. Considering figure 11. Again I think this are aggregates of due to syp21
expression (maybe the toxins increase aggregation by a pleiotropic effect). As syp21
binds the membrane of the vesicles, larger vesicles should not have any fluorescence
on the inside.
Aggregates were not due to SYP21 overexpression since, as observed for
Wm, large compartments appeared as uniform structures and so very different from
those observed after overexpression (compare with Fig.7). Furthermore, the amount
of plasmid was the same in control and treatment experiments. In addition, in our
opinion, it is unlikely that aggregation was a pleiotropic effect due to toxicity of
oryzalin since other MTs perturbing drugs showed the same effect. However, in Fig.
11 (J-M) we inserted pictures of Ory-treated pollen tubes showing YFP-SYP21
surface staining of large PVCs. We inserted a comment of Fig. 11 in Results: pg 16,
lines 381-383. Figure caption was also modified. It is possible that MT perturbation
affect the dynamic of dancing-endosome interaction (von Wangenheim et al., 2016)
inducing a delay in vacuolar traffic and the enlargement of SYP21 compartments.
This hypothesis was inserted in Discussion: pg 24, lines 579-582.
9. There are statistics missing for figure 12.
The statistical analysis of data showed in Fig. 12 is reported in Fig.10.
10. Sometimes I do not understand the strategy. The authors independently express
YFP-SYP21 and GFP-BP80 and show that the localization looks similar and also the
size of the organelles stained. Ok, this might be some sort of weak evidence, but
why dont the authors just coexpress the proteins to show colocalization? Its an easy
cloning step to exchange the fluorophor. Then the plasmids can be simply mixed and
used for particle bombardment.
We performed the colocalization between YFP-SYP21 and GFP-BP80 using
the protocol published by Foresti et al, 2006. For details of colocalization and
crosstalk procedures please see Materials and Methods (pg 33, lines 817-820) and
Figure caption (Fig.S4), respectively. Colocalization and crosstalk images are
described in Results (pg 12, lines 279-288) and showed in Fig.S3 and Fig.S4,
respectively.
Referee: 3
This MS mainly showed the involvement of microtubules (MTs) in regulating
trafficking to tubular vacuoles in tobacco pollen tubes. Major findings include: 1)
Microtubules is showed to preferentially bind PVCs in vitro in an ATP-dependent
manner; 2) SYP21 is found to be localized on PVCs and tubular vacuoles in tobacco
pollen tubes; and 3) Studies using different drugs affecting the polymerization status
of microtubules showed that different microtubules populations play specific roles in
PVC trafficking and in PVC delivery to and/or fusion with tubular vacuoles in the
apex/shank with respect to the distal regions.
Some comments:
1) It is known that motor proteins mediate vesicles (e.g. PVCs) transport along the
filamentous MTs. The PVCs are believed to transport from TGN to the vacuole
along MTs. The conclusion of this study is not novel, but the in vitro experiment
design is interesting.
Actually there are a few papers supporting the hypothesis of kinesin
homologues in pollen tubes, reporting in vitro binding and movement assays using
pollen tube microsomes and calf brain purified MTs. However, as far as we know,
the organelles/vesicles interacting and/or moving on MTs in vitro were not identified
(Tiezzi et al., 1992 Cell Motil Cytoskel 21:132-137; Liu et al., 1994 Cell Motil
Cytoskel 29:155-166; Romagnoli et al., 2003 Plant Cell 15: 251-269). Therefore, we
think that this is the first report showing the interaction of PVCs and MTs in pollen
tubes.
Figure 1 showed that Taxol-purified MTs could bind to microsomes (including
PVCs) in vitro. Based on Figure 1F and G only, it is very hard to conclude that small
particles (that are associated with MT-bound vesicles such as PVCs) mediated the
interaction between MTs and vesicles. The small particles could be tiny vesicles or
protein complex. More evidences or related discussions are needed to address this
question.
We agree with the referee that “Based on Figure 1F and G only, it is very
hard to conclude that small particles (that are associated with MT-bound vesicles
such as PVCs) mediated the interaction between MTs and vesicles”. We mitigated
the concept modifying results: Pg 5 line 107 and Discussion pg 23, line 561, 562. At
the end of this paragraph (pg 23 lines 565-567 underlined), it was already reported
this sentence: “Further experiments to characterize SYP21-positive endosome
proteins, responsible for the interaction with MTs, are therefore needed to clarify
this point”.
2) In Figure 2, SYP21 antibody is used as the only PVC marker. Since SYP21 also
showed tubular vacuole pattern as shown in this study, it would be more convincing
to include additional PVC marker (like VSR) in Figure 2 to prove that the MTs
could bind PVCs instead of tubular vacuoles.
We cannot exclude at this point that MTs could interact both with PVC and
tubular vacuoles. In fact, also if not significant, there is a clear difference in V-H+
ATPase signal comparing P(-MT) and P(+MT), suggesting that MTs could also
interact with vacuolar compartments. In previous papers, the interaction of MTs and
vacuoles was hypothesized based on data showing that the use of high concentration
of oryzalin alters the vacuole localization in N. silvestris (Joos et al. 1994) and N.
tabacum (Idilli et al, 2013). It could be extremely interesting to perform additional
experiments to clarify this points in a next paper.
3) What is the nature of SYP21-postive tubular vacuoles? Are they intermediate
compartments between PVC and the vacuole or only the accumulation of PVCs
owing to SYP21overexpression?
Tubular compartments were already identified as vacuoles in apical growing
cells as pollen tubes, root hairs and fungi (see discussion), since they were stained
by typical vacuole markers as CDFDA and CMAC (see discussion). In this paper it
was showed for the first time the presence of SYP21 on this tubular compartment in
pollen tube, allowing to hypothesize an additional function for this organelle in
endosome traffic, as shown in fungi (see discussion). In our opinion, the
overexpression of SYP21 was not the cause of the presence of this protein on tubular
compartments. In SYP21 overexpressed pollen tubes the stain of tubular
compartments was comparable or even lower with respect to not overexpressed
cells ( see Fig 7).
We tested growing plasmid concentrations and the lowest concentration that
allows to observe SYP21 staining was chosen (see Results pg 10, lines 232-234).
4) Figure 9: The chemical dye, CMAC was used to label the vacuoles, however, the
strong cytosol pattern of this dye could also be observed. The colocalization between
CMAC and YFP-SYP21 may not be precise enough. Coexpression of the vacuole
membrane marker like RFP-VAMP711, with YFP-SYP21 or YFP-VSR would be a
better choice to demonstrate their colocalization.
Blue-CMAC staining was specific for tubular compartments. Actually we
could not observe diffuse staining of the cytoplasm or cytoplasmic structures
different from tubular compartments. Blue-CMAC such as CDFDA was largely used
to stain tubular vacuoles in fungi and plant apical growing cells (see references in
the paper). In addition no crosstalk was detected between two channels (SYP21 and
CMAC) as demonstrated by supplemental Fig. 7 which was added in the paper. The
coexpression with RFP-VAMP711 YFP-VSR could be planned for the near future to
better define the actual identity and the role of tubular compartment in endosome
traffic.
In addition, we would like to underline that our purpose in this paper was to
investigate the role of MTs in membrane trafficking. The unexpected localization of
SYP21 on tubular compartments led to hypothesized that this membrane system
could have new functions than previously believed. Therefore, these data represent
important new insights to prompt us to investigate on the actual function of tubular
compartments.
5) Based on the current data, one can only make a conclusion that the PVCs
travelled via MTs, without indicating the direction of movement (TGN to vacuole or
the opposite?). The in vivo dynamic study could be useful to address this point.
The involvement of MTs in organelle trafficking remains elusive in plant
cells. Recent data supports a role of MTs in polarized growth together with new
evidence of a correlation between endocytosis and exocytosis in the pollen tube apex
(Idilli et al. 2013). The emerging picture supports the idea that MTs are involved in
vesicle trafficking leading to degradation pathways. The goal of this study was to
investigate the role of MTs in some steps of the degradation pathways. For this
reason we used one of the markers of organelles involved in the trafficking to
vacuoles.
The enlargement of PVCs and the disappearance of SYP21 from tubular
compartments following MTs perturbing drugs, allowed us to support that MTs play
a role in delivering SYP21 positive PVCs to tubular compartments.
The possible involvement of MT-dependent trafficking of membrane from and
to TGN, of course, will be studied by using in vivo dynamic approaches using
specific markers for Golgi bodies and TGN.
We think that our data offer interesting cues to proceed in studying different
steps of membrane trafficking in pollen tubes. However we think that the use of
additional constructs and/or the in vivo dynamic assays to and from TGN would
require to make more papers.
