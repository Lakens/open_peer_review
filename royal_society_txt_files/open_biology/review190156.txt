In this manuscript the authors report the results of CRISPR-Cas9 screens looking for genetic
vulnerabilities to ATR inhibition. The results provide a useful resource for investigators in the
DNA repair, replication, and DNA damage signaling fields. The writing and figures are clear
and the conclusions are appropriate. I recommend publication. The following comments may
assist the authors in improving the final version of the manuscript.
1. It is difficult to judge overlap between the 4 screens in the three cell types. I recommend
including a simple Venn diagram.

2. Page 6: “ATRIP is an activator of ATR”. ATRIP is best described as a subunit of the ATR-
ATRIP kinase complex (Cortez et al., Science 2001). The use of the word activator here could be
confusing since the ATR signaling field uses this word to describe TOPBP1 and ETAA1 which
bind and stimulate the ATR-ATRIP kinase complex.
3. The observation that partial reduction in ATR activity sensitizes to ATR inhibition was
previously published (Mohni et al., Cancer Research 2014) and should be referenced on page 6
where the authors make a similar conclusion..
4. The authors do not do much follow-up of any of the screen hits within the manuscript except
for asking if a histone deposition function of POLE3/POLE4 is involved in generating ATR
inhibitor hyper-sensitivity. Their experiments suggest it is not. Developing a mechanistic
understanding of why loss of these polymerase subunits causes ATR inhibitor hypersensitivity
could be quite difficult (and beyond the scope of this manuscript). However, it is interesting that
POLE and POLE2 were not identified in the screen. This is also true in the other CRISPR screen
(Wang et al., Oncogene 2018). However, siRNA to POLE does cause hypersensitivity to ATR
inhibitor in U2OS cells (Mohni et al., Plos One 2015 and Mohni et al., Cancer Research 2014).
While it is possible that the siRNA experiments were caused by off-target effects, the simplest
interpretation is that a reduction in DNA synthesis activity underlies the hypersensitivity. Did
the authors check whether POLE or POLE2 loss of function either by CRISPR or RNA
interference phenocopies POLE3/POLE4 ATR inhibitor hypersensitivity in their hands? Do they
observe any effect of POLE3 and POLE4 inactivation on DNA synthesis rates? Even if no further
experiments are completed, additional discussion about why these two subunits and not POLE or
POLE2 are strong hits in their screens would be useful.

sincerely thank the expert Reviewer for his/her comments. Below is our point-by-point
ponse. The Reviewer’s comments are italicized and a bullet point precedes our responses.
eree #1:
n this manuscript the authors report the results of CRISPR-Cas9 screens looking for genetic
erabilities to ATR inhibition. The results provide a useful resource for investigators in the
A repair, replication, and DNA damage signaling fields. The writing and figures are clear and
conclusions are appropriate. I recommend publication. The following comments may assist
authors in improving the final version of the manuscript.
It is difficult to judge overlap between the 4 screens in the three cell types. I recommend
including a simple Venn diagram.
• We thank the Reviewer for this comment. To help with screen comparison we generated
an UpSet plot instead of a Venn diagram for the 7 screens. The two most related
screens are the two screens done as part of this study in RPE1 cells. The UpSet plot is
now in the revised Supplementary Fig 1c and is now referred in the text on p6.
Page 6: “ATRIP is an activator of ATR”. ATRIP is best described as a subunit of the
ATR-ATRIP kinase complex (Cortez et al., Science 2001). The use of the word activator
here could be confusing since the ATR signaling field uses this word to describe
TOPBP1 and ETAA1 which bind and stimulate the ATR-ATRIP kinase complex.
• The Reviewer is correct and we have changed the text to state that ATRIP is a subunit
of the ATR-ATRIP complex (see revised manuscript p6).
The observation that partial reduction in ATR activity sensitizes to ATR inhibition was
previously published (Mohni et al., Cancer Research 2014) and should be referenced on
page 6 where the authors make a similar conclusion.
• Thank you for noting our omission. The reference to Mohni et al. 2014 is now included in
the revised manuscript (p6).
The authors do not do much follow-up of any of the screen hits within the manuscript
except for asking if a histone deposition function of POLE3/POLE4 is involved in
generating ATR inhibitor hyper-sensitivity. Their experiments suggest it is not.
Developing a mechanistic understanding of why loss of these polymerase subunits
causes ATR inhibitor hypersensitivity could be quite difficult (and beyond the scope of
this manuscript). However, it is interesting that POLE and POLE2 were not identified in
the screen. This is also true in the other CRISPR screen (Wang et al., Oncogene 2018).
However, siRNA to POLE does cause hypersensitivity to ATR inhibitor in U2OS cells
(Mohni et al., Plos One 2015 and Mohni et al., Cancer Research 2014). While it is
possible that the siRNA experiments were caused by off-target effects, the simplest
interpretation is that a reduction in DNA synthesis activity underlies the hypersensitivity.
Did the authors check whether POLE or POLE2 loss of function either by CRISPR or
RNA interference phenocopies POLE3/POLE4 ATR inhibitor hypersensitivity in their
hands? Do they observe any effect of POLE3 and POLE4 inactivation on DNA synthesis
rates? Even if no further experiments are completed, additional discussion about why
these two subunits and not POLE or POLE2 are strong hits in their screens would be
useful.
• The Reviewer is correct in raising the potential role for POLE and POLE2 in mediating
resistance to ATR inhibitors. Challenged DNA replication is a well-known vulnerability
to ATR inhibition. However, it is very difficult to comment on negative results in genetic
screens, and this is especially relevant for genes that are essential. It may well be that
the depletion of the sgRNAs against POLE and POLE2 was too severe in our edited
populations to get a reliable quantitation prior and post ATRi treatment. In our opinion,
this remains the likeliest explanation.
That being said, while null Pole4-/- mouse cells show evidence of DNA replication
stress, Bellelli et al. (Bellelli et al., 2018) recently analysed the phenotypes of
POLE3/POLE4 depletion by siRNA and the authors concluded that transient depletion
of POLE3/POLE4 does “not induce significant levels of replication stress nor obvious
changes in cell cycle profile or BrdU incorporation”. This is consistent with the
observation that POLE3/4 are dispensable for in vitro DNA replication (Goswami et al.,
2018). Therefore, while we now acknowledge that perturbation in Pol e activity may be
the root cause of the hypersensitivity of POLE3/4-deficient cells to ATRi (p8), it
remains a distinct possibility that the POLE3/POLE4 accessory subunits coordinate a
replication-associated process, distinct from DNA polymerisation, that allows cells to
survive upon ATR inhibitor treatment. We have modified the manuscript to briefly
discuss these points (see revised manuscript p8).
