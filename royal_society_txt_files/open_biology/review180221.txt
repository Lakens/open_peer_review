Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The submitted manuscript deals with an interesting area of energy transduction and its coupling
in biological system. In general, this subject would be interesting for a wide group of readers.
Partially, consideration and critical analysis of P. Mitchell theory is certainly very appreciated.
However, at the present form the manuscript does not satisfy the aim it has been created for.
Instead of comprehensive and detailed analysis the authors made a strong but strange suggestion
that the P. Mitchell has to be rejected because non-mitochondrial phosphorylation had been
found. This conclusion does not really matter to the theory because the main aspect of chemo-
osmatic theory is a COUPLING MEMBRANE. The general phenomenon is the local energetic
barriers near the membrane which create a new possible ability of local coupling. However, this
aspect just modifies but does not reject the theory. It needs to be considered and described
properly. But it does not.
The text is filled up with many cites of reviews and researches but for a reader it looks like non-
systemic. There is no real idea what is a new hypothesis on coupling which is postulated in the
title. Exta-mitochondrial phosphorylation is not a new hypothesis of coupling. Possibly, authors
need to discuss a parallel existence of proton leakage and transport in the channel. Explain the
role of local processes for the coupling. And it will be development but not rejection of Mitchell
theory. It will make an appropriate level of knowledge for the readers.
Additionally, the figures in the manuscript are poor and too schematic. If the main aim is to
discover the mechanism of coupling at least one figure must contain many details and indications
of the process. Thus, the illustrative materials have to be essentially improved.
For minor but essential remarks. In line 236 in the phrase “..transversal or permeability diffusion
coefficients…” the word “diffusion” must be omitted. The references are prepared in inaccurate
manner. In particular, in line 800 ref.# 117 is formed as a mistake.

justify the idea of proton currents occurring inside the Coupling Membrane instead of across it:
considering that the extra-mitochondrial phosphorylation takes place outside the plasma-
membrane, free protons could not accumulate there. Therefore, in the revised version, to
highlight the crucial existence of proton currents inner the membrane we proposed the following

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
The revised version of the manuscript is improved in general according to the reviewers’
comments. Unfortunately, some technical errors still exist in the text (for example, on Page 7 line
29, missed space). Nevertheless, it seems to be in general appropriate for presentation to a
common reader. Certainly, many aspects of membrane bioenergetics still remain unclear and
they are the points of the discussion. Not all of them included into the review. However, the
point of view represented in the submitted manuscript is a general point of possible discussion
and it seems to be a background of further development of the coupling theory.

Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should

Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
