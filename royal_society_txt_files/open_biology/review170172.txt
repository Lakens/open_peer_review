Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The authors of this very nice review have recapitulated the mass of available data concerning the
programmed DNA elimination that takes place while the ciliate Tetrahymena develops its
polyploid somatic MAC from its diploid germline MIC. The review is organized in three major
chapters: a description of the germline sequences that are removed from the MAC (the “Whats”),
with an emphasis on their link to transposable elements, an overview of all molecular actors
(non-coding RNAs and proteins) that participate in the process (the “Hows”) and a discussion on
the putative roles played by eliminated sequences in the organization and evolution of MIC
chromosomes, and by DNA elimination in the adaptation of Tetrahymena to environmental
changes (the “Whys”). Overall, the review is well written and the figures are extremely well
done. Figure 3, in particular, represents a real “tour de force” and summarizes the current
knowledge on the complex machinery that carries out DNA elimination.
Please find a few comments below that may be helpful to further improve the clarity of the
manuscript.
(1) p.2 line 8: a reference is required for the telomere-to-telomere assemblies of the MIC genome
sequence.
(2) p.2 lines 19-20: the sentence may need to be changed to “Dr Martin Gorovsky, our former
supervisor, taught us not to ask…”
(3) p.3 lines 5-6: a more detailed description of the process of phenotypic assortment would help
ciliates non-aficionados to understand the discrepancies between the different methods used to
calculate the copy number of MAC chromosomes.
(4) p.4 lines 9-10: according to the authors’ definition of an IES (i.e. a stretch of MIC DNA that is
destined for DNA elimination), what distinguishes IESs from NMCs is not clear. Should one also
consider the difference in the endonuclease that carries out the elimination of each type of
sequence? The authors should provide more information to clarify this point.
(5) The relationship between TEs and IESs is not clear. Here, the authors state that 46 to 54 Mb of
MIC DNA are eliminated as IESs, among which 18 Mb are clearly TE-related sequences. What are
the remaining 28 to 36 Mb? Do the authors postulate that they are degenerated TEs that are no
more recognizable, or that they are totally non-TE MIC DNA? Later on (p.7 line 11), the authors
suggest that young (=active) TEs are mostly found in type A IESs, while type B IESs would
contain degenerated TEs. Based on this scattered information, it is difficult to get a clear idea of
where TEs are located relative to IESs in the MIC genome: do all IESs contain at least one TE (old
or young), or can IESs be made of other type of sequences? Grouping all this information in a
single section may certainly help to clarify this point. More clarification should also help the
reader to follow the discussion on p.12-13, in which the authors seem to consider that all IESs
contain TEs.

(6) p.6 line 2: “the molecular players behind this small RNA-mediated regulation ARE
discussed…”
(7) p.6 line 30 and below: the role of Early-scnRNAs is not quite clear to me. The authors mention
that they trigger heterochomatin formation on type A IESs and A-repeats within type B IESs. Are
Early-scnRNAs able to induce DNA elimination by themselves? Do Late-scnRNAs exclusively
play this role (because they are synthesized in cis)? A related issue would be whether elimination
of A-repeats can be detected under conditions where type B IESs are not removed.
(8) p.8 line 8: the authors refer to unpublished data while stating that 2’-O-methylation of Early-
scnRNAs is not necessary for scnRNA selection. Additional details may be required here: I
suppose that in Hen1 mutants (or knockdowns), all scnRNAs are more unstable, but are MAC
scnRNAs still selectively degraded?
(9) p.8 lines 22-23: the sentence “When the new MAC develops…” is ambiguous. One may
understand that all Twi1p-Early-scnRNA complexes are not degraded by scnRNA selection.
Don’t the authors rather mean “those Twi1p-Early-scnRNA complexes that are not degraded by
scnRNA selection move from the parental MAC to the new MAC”?

noncoding RNA guided heterochromatin formation in eukaryotic systems. The review is
scientifically rigorous and well written. I strongly recommend its publication as it is.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_3
This review article by Noto and Mochizuki overviews programmed genome rearrangement in
Tetrahymena. The manuscript is well written, and I have no serious concerns. I only make some
minor comments as a representative of general readers.
1. Page 1 line 25 – Page 2 line 2:
The first paragraph of Introduction needs more efforts for general readers.
References are necessary for each of the statements “In this process, many transposon-related
sequences ---“ and “RNAi-related mechanisms ---“.
For a better logical stream, I would suggest to reverse the order of two sentences: “This review
aims to overview ---“ and “There are substantial differences in mechanisms ---“. This is because
the sentence “There are substantial differences in mechanisms ---“ is better connected to ““RNAi-
related mechanisms ---“, and the sentence “This review aims to overview ---- in Tetrahymena” is
better connected to “We refer --- in other ciliates.”
2. Page 6 line 11 – Page 7 line 15:
Appropriate references should be provided for better understanding in this section.
5
3. Page 3 lines 5 – 6:
Two values of the copy number (~70 copies and ~45 copies) are given with reservation. On the
other hand, the legend to Figure 1 definitely says ~70 copies. To keep consistency, I would
suggest to change it to “45~70 copies” or “up to ~70 copes” in Figure 1.
4. Page 10 line 31:
“Figure 4, red circles” should be “yellow” circles.
5. Page 14 lines 18 – 22:
The sentence “The amitotic chromosome segregation of the polyploidy MAC can positively or
negatively select a variant” intends to describe “phenotypic assortment”. However, it is difficult
to imagine what is happening in the cell. I would suggest describe those events in more details by
using the term “phenotypic assortment” with appropriate citations. In this accordance, in Figure
6, an arrow labeled “Phenotypic assortment” should be added after “Conjugation” because the
panel shown after “Conjugation” is a result of “Phenotypic assortment” not only “Conjugation”.
6. Figure 1:
The process (i) “The MIC undergoes meiosis and post-meiotic division resulting in two haploid
pronuclei”: it is not easy to imagine the events occurring. More sequences are necessary to be
added such as: “The MIC undergoes meiosis to generate four haploid nuclei, and three of them
are eliminated (or discarded); one selected haploid nucleus proceeds with post-meiotic division
to form two haploid pronuclei”. These complicated events are difficult to understand without
illustration. I would suggest include illustration showing these events.
(ii) “One of the two pronuclei” is easier to imagine the event sequences, following the preceding
sentence.

Appendix A
Referee: 1
(1) p.2 line 8: a reference is required for the telomere-to-telomere assemblies of the MIC genome
sequence.
We have added the reference. Also, we have changed the text as “the assemblies of nearly full-length
MIC chromosomes”
(2) p.2 lines 19-20: the sentence may need to be changed to “Dr Martin Gorovsky, our former supervisor,
taught us not to ask…”
We have changed the text as suggested.
(3) p.3 lines 5-6: a more detailed description of the process of phenotypic assortment would help
ciliates non-aficionados to understand the discrepancies between the different methods used to
calculate the copy number of MAC chromosomes.
We have changed the paragraph as: “However, this number does not agree well with the estimates
(~45 C) from the kinetics of phenotypic assortment [10,11], the process in which chromosome copies
distribute randomly during MAC vegetative division.”
(4) p.4 lines 9-10: according to the authors’ definition of an IES (i.e. a stretch of MIC DNA that is
destined for DNA elimination), what distinguishes IESs from NMCs is not clear. Should one also consider
the difference in the endonuclease that carries out the elimination of each type of sequence? The
authors should provide more information to clarify this point.
NMC is a MAC chromosome that is produced by the chromosome breakage and somewhat
disappeared during vegetative growth. On the other hand, IES is a DNA segment that is “spliced out”
from the MAC chromosome and degraded right after its removal. To clarify these points, we have
added “The mechanism for the disappearance of NMCs is not known.” In the section explaining NMCs
and have changed the IES-related section as “The second type of programmed genome rearrangement
is the elimination of internal DNA segments, called internal eliminated sequence (IES), followed by the
ligation of flanking MAC-destined sequences (Fig. 1B)”
(5) The relationship between TEs and IESs is not clear. Here, the authors state that 46 to 54 Mb of MIC
DNA are eliminated as IESs, among which 18 Mb are clearly TE-related sequences. What are the
remaining 28 to 36 Mb? Do the authors postulate that they are degenerated TEs that are no more
recognizable, or that they are totally non-TE MIC DNA? Later on (p.7 line 11), the authors suggest that
young (=active) TEs are mostly found in type A IESs, while type B IESs would contain degenerated TEs.
Based on this scattered information, it is difficult to get a clear idea of where TEs are located relative
to IESs in the MIC genome: do all IESs contain at least one TE (old or young), or can IESs be made of
other type of sequences? Grouping all this information in a single section may certainly help to clarify
this point. More clarification should also help the reader to follow the discussion on p.12-13, in which
the authors seem to consider that all IESs contain TEs.
Although it is possible that majority of IESs are remnants of TEs, their relatedness to TEs was not able
to be detected. To clarify this point, we have added the following sentence to p.5: “Some or many
regions of IESs that do not show detectable homology with TEs might also be remnants of
TEs.”
(6) p.6 line 2: “the molecular players behind this small RNA-mediated regulation ARE discussed…”
We have changed the sentence as suggested.
(7) p.6 line 30 and below: the role of Early-scnRNAs is not quite clear to me. The authors mention that
they trigger heterochomatin formation on type A IESs and A-repeats within type B IESs. Are Early-
scnRNAs able to induce DNA elimination by themselves? Do Late-scnRNAs exclusively play this role
(because they are synthesized in cis)?
To clarify these points, we have added the following sentences to the revised manuscript: “When the
accumulation of Late-scnRNAs was inhibited by genetically removing zygotically-expressed Twi1p and
Twi11p (see below), DNA eliminations of Type-A IESs were only weakly inhibited and those of Type-B
IESs were more strongly, but not completely, inhibited [40]. These indicate that Early-scnRNAs can
directly induce DNA elimination but Late-scnRNAs are necessary to ensure complete removal of all IES
copies from the MAC.”
A related issue would be whether elimination of A-repeats can be detected under conditions where
type B IESs are not removed.
This has not been studied and we cannot make any comment on this issue.
(8) p.8 line 8: the authors refer to unpublished data while stating that 2’-O-methylation of Early-
scnRNAs is not necessary for scnRNA selection. Additional details may be required here: I suppose that
in Hen1 mutants (or knockdowns), all scnRNAs are more unstable, but are MAC scnRNAs still selectively
degraded?
To add missing information, we have changed the corresponding sentences as follows: “Although
Early-scnRNAs are stabilized by Hen1p-catalyzed 2´-O-methylation at their 3´-ends (Figure 3-g) [55],
this modification does not appear to be involved in scnRNA selection because Early-scnRNAs
complementary to the MAC genome were degraded faster than those to IESs even in the absence of
Hen1p (unpublished).”
(9) p.8 lines 22-23: the sentence “When the new MAC develops…” is ambiguous. One may understand
that all Twi1p-Early-scnRNA complexes are not degraded by scnRNA selection. Don’t the authors rather
mean “those Twi1p-Early-scnRNA complexes that are not degraded by scnRNA selection move from
the parental MAC to the new MAC”?
We have changed the sentence as suggested.

“There are substantial differences in mechanisms ---“ is better connected to ““RNAi-related

We have reversed the order of the sentences as suggested.

We have changed the figure as suggested.
4. Page 10 line 31:
“Figure 4, red circles” should be “yellow” circles.
We have corrected the information.
5. Page 14 lines 18 – 22:
The sentence “The amitotic chromosome segregation of the polyploidy MAC can positively or
negatively select a variant” intends to describe “phenotypic assortment”. However, it is difficult to
imagine what is happening in the cell. I would suggest describe those events in more details by using
the term “phenotypic assortment” with appropriate citations. In this accordance, in Figure 6, an arrow
labeled “Phenotypic assortment” should be added after “Conjugation” because the panel shown after
“Conjugation” is a result of “Phenotypic assortment” not only “Conjugation”.
We have changed the corresponding sentence as “The phenotypic assortment [10,11], in which
amitotic chromosome segregation of the polyploid MAC randomly assort a variant, may provide
increased fitness to cells that are adapting to environmental change.” We think once phenotypic
assortment purifies a MAC variant, this variant can be reproduced in the new MAC by DNA elimination
without phenotypic assortment. To clarify this point, we have changed the text as “Moreover, the
scnRNA selection mechanism allows an advantageous DNA elimination variant to be epigenetically
inherited by sexual progeny without phenotypic assortment”.
6. Figure 1:
The process (i) “The MIC undergoes meiosis and post-meiotic division resulting in two haploid
pronuclei”: it is not easy to imagine the events occurring. More sequences are necessary to be added
such as: “The MIC undergoes meiosis to generate four haploid nuclei, and three of them are eliminated
(or discarded); one selected haploid nucleus proceeds with post-meiotic division to form two haploid
pronuclei”. These complicated events are difficult to understand without illustration. I would suggest
include illustration showing these events.
(ii) “One of the two pronuclei” is easier to imagine the event sequences, following the preceding
sentence.
We have added the meiosis and post-meiosis processes in the legend as suggested. We did not change
the figure because our focus here is nuclear differentiation but not the meiosis/ post-meiosis
processes.
