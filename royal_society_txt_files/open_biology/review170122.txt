In this paper, Ma et al. report their finding that ZC4H2 regulates the BMP pathway by preventing
the stability of Smad1/5, key mediators of the BMP signaling. They started from analyzing the
expression of ZC4H2 during Xenopus embryonic development. In agreement with the view that
ZC4H2 regulates BMP signaling positively, knockdown of ZC4H2 expands neural ectoderm in
Xenopus embryos. Consistently, overexpression of ZC4H2 reduces muscle differentiation of
C2C12 cells, whereas knockdown of ZC4H2 increases the expression of muscle markers. BMP
responsive luciferase assay further support the function of ZC4H2 in the BMP pathway. At the
molecular level, ZC4H2 protects Smad1/5 from binding Smurf1 and 2, preventing Smurf-
dependent ubiquitination/degradation of Smad1/5. Mutations in ZC4H2 protein are associated
with human intellectual disorders. They further tested the activities of some of these mutants
identified from patients. It seems that at least some mutants show reduced activity in mediating
BMP signaling. These findings are novel and would make a significant contribution to the field.
However, there are a number of significant weaknesses that need to be addressed. At a glance, a
few results reported in the paper do not make sense.
Major concerns:
1) The authors have provided strong evidence that ZC4H2 stabilizes Smad1/5 and promotes
BMP signaling cell autonomously in BMP receiving cells. ZC4H2 is specifically expressed in the
neural ectoderm, the tissue in which BMP signaling is inhibited. Why would knockdown of
ZC4H2, a positive regulator of BMP signaling that is expressed in the neural ectoderm, expand
the neural plate? It seems that ZC4H2 promotes epidermis cell fate in a cell non-autonomous
fashion. What is the mechanism by which ZC4H2 regulates the cell fate determination of the
ectoderm? Similarly, why would injection of ZC4H2 MO in to animal caps, which presumably do
not express ZC4H2, decreases the expression of keratin and slug, and induces the expression of
sox2 and pax3? Have the authors assessed the protein level of endogenous Smad1/5 in Xenopus
embryos? Is the protein level of Smad1/5 higher in the neural ectoderm?
2) Fig 2 C-H: The effects of siRNAs knockdown in Hep3B cells should be assessed.
3) Fig 7I and J: in these experiments, degradation of Smad1/5 was prevented by MG132.
Overexpression of ZC4H2 decreased the level of ubiquitinated Smads. Surprisingly,
overexpression of ZC4H2, which prevents ubiquitination of Smads, failed to increase the level of
non-ubiquitinated Smads. Why is that?
4) Fig 10 A-D: Results shown in these experiments are not convincing. In A and B, the activities
of mutants toward Smad proteins may be slightly lower than that of the wild type protein.
Nonetheless, all ZC4H2 mutants stabilized Smad1/5 proteins significantly. It is weird that neither
the wild type protein nor those mutants enhanced the activity of BMP2 significantly in the
luciferase reporter assay (C and D). For people who has experience with luciferase assay, it is
hard to believe those “statistically significant” changes shown in panel C and D are really
significant in any meaningful way. How reproducible are these results?

Have the authors assessed the protein level of endogenous Smad1/5 in Xenopus embryos? Is the
protein level of Smad1/5 higher in the neural ectoderm?
Thank you for your suggestions and comments. Firstly, we analyzed the expression patterns of
ZC4H2 in the Xenopus earlier developing embryos (cleavage and gastrula embryos) by whole
mount in situ hybridization assays. Indeed, we found that, as indicated by the RT-PCR results,
ZC4H2 is maternally expressed and its transcripts were detected mainly in animal hemispheres at
the cleavage embryos before gastrulation. As the embryos develop, ZC4H2 mRNAs accumulate in
the dorsal marginal zone during gastrulation and show a neural ectoderm specific expression
pattern after gastrulation when the body plans are established. And also, we examined the
expression of ZC4H2 in animal caps by RT-PCR assays and found than ZC4H2 is absolutely
transcribed in animal caps. Therefore, it is possible that ZC4H2 acts as a cell autonomous BMP
enhancer to promote ectoderm induction and inhibit neural induction in the Xenopus embryos at
earlier stages when its neural ectoderm specific expression pattern established (i.e., late cleavage
or early gastrula embryos). We failed to examined the endogenous Smad1/5 protein levels in
Xenopus embryos or animal caps as no specific signals or specific bands were detected in the
immunofluorescence or western blot assays because of the poor compatibility of the Smad1/5
antibody we used to Xenopus Smads proteins.
In addition, studies in zebrafish suggest that ZC4H2 plays a critical role in dorsal-ventral
patterning of neural tube (1,2). Therefore, collectively, the previous and our this studies suggested
that ZC4H2 plays two different roles in early and late development stages respectively: functions
as an ectoderm inducer and neural inhibitor through cell autonomous BMP enhancement at early
stages with a broader ectoderm expression pattern and involves in dorsal-ventral patterning of
neural tube at late stages when its expression mainly restricts to the neural ectoderm tissues. We
could not rule out the possibility that its cell autonomous BMP enhancement activity we report
here contributes to late development process ZC4H2 involved in, such as dorsal-ventral patterning
of neural tube.
The related results were added into Figure 1 and the discussions were also added into in our
revised manuscript which were highlighted in red.
2) Fig 2 C-H: The effects of siRNAs knockdown in Hep3B cells should be assessed.
Thank you for your suggestions. We examined the effects of siRNAs-mediated knockdown and
overexpression effects in both Hep3B and C2C12 cells in Figure 2 by realtime RT-PCR assays.
And we found that all the siRNAs used for targeting human ZC4H2 in Hep3B and mouse ZC4H2
in C2C12 cell lines showed significant efficiency for knocking-down the endogenous ZC4H2.
Both cells received large amount of exogenous ZC4H2 transcripts when the ZC4H2 plasmids
were transfected into. And also, BMP treatment shows no effects on either the endogenous or
exogenous ZC4H2 expressions in the both cell lines. The related results were added into Figure 2
in our revised manuscripts.
3) Fig 7I and J: in these experiments, degradation of Smad1/5 was prevented by MG132.
Overexpression of ZC4H2 decreased the level of ubiquitinated Smads. Surprisingly,
overexpression of ZC4H2, which prevents ubiquitination of Smads, failed to increase the level of
non-ubiquitinated Smads. Why is that?
Thank you for your comments. Usually, to compare the status of ubiquitination on target proteins
by such in vivo ubiquitination assays, MG132 were introduced to normalized the total target
protein level by blocking ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation (3). When the cells
were treated with MG132, only fewer of total target proteins were ubiquitinated as
ubiquitination-protosome degradation machinery were always saturated by the ubiquitinated target
proteins, compared to control cells without MG132 treatment. And also, the signals of
polyubiquitinated proteins were “artificially” amplified when we blot the polyubiquitinated
proteins with ubiquitin antibody as no more than one ubiquitin moiety were incorporated into one
target protein. Therefore, it is reasonable that ZC4H2 overexpression failed to increase the level of
overexpressed non-ubiquitinated Smads in the presence of MG132 in Figure 7I and J.
4) Fig 10 A-D: Results shown in these experiments are not convincing. In A and B, the
activities of mutants toward Smad proteins may be slightly lower than that of the wild type protein.
Nonetheless, all ZC4H2 mutants stabilized Smad1/5 proteins significantly. It is weird that neither
the wild type protein nor those mutants enhanced the activity of BMP2 significantly in the
luciferase reporter assay (C and D). For people who has experience with luciferase assay, it is hard
to believe those “statistically significant” changes shown in panel C and D are really significant in
any meaningful way. How reproducible are these results?
Thank you for your comment. Firstly, we can confirm that the “statistically significant” changes
shown in panel C and D of Figure 10 is true as these experiments were repeated at least three time
independently and the results were reproducible. Maybe, it is the quite little variation among the
RLU values make the not so significant changes really significant in a statistically meaningful way
with P<0.05 as significant and P<0.01 as very significant in our assays. Why neither the wild type
ZC4H2 nor the mutants enhanced the activity of BMP2 significantly in the luciferase reporter
assay (shown in panel C and D) as they did to stabilize overexpressed Smads proteins (shown in
panel A and B)? Indeed, ZC4H2 overexpression showed much less stabilization efficiency toward
the endogenous (Figure 9A and B) than the overexpressed Smads proteins (Figure 7A and B) in
the western blot assays. Another explanation maybe that the BMP reporter we used is not so
sensitive to the Smads protein levels.

Thank you for your comments and suggestions. Indeed, ZC4H2 overexpression showed no clear
effect on neural formation and embryogenesis when we overexpressed ZC4H2 in Xenopus
embryos with the same amount (about 500 pg per embryo) used in our rescue experiments. Indeed,
severe malformations and enhanced neural induction indicated by expanded Sox2 expression were
observed in the embryos into which a much larger amount of ZC4H2 mRNAs (about 1-2 ng) were
introduced. We have not discussed the point here because we could not distinguish whether the
phenotype is really attributed to ZC4H2 overexpression or not at present as high amount of mRNA
overexpression in Xenopus embryos usually induces many artificial phenotypes, such as ectopic
apoptosis. Further detailed tests are needed to give a precise answer to this question.
Since the author have put a lot of efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ZC4H2 in
regulating BMP signalling, and the neural development actually serves as a readout of BMP
signalling, the same as the myogenic differentiation and osteogenesis of C2C12, they may
consider to revise the title, and highlight their finding on mediating BMP signalling pathway.
Thank you for your comments and we revised the article title to “ZC4H2 stabilizes Smads to
enhance BMP signaling, which is involved in neural development in Xenopus” and revised the
running title to “ZC4H2 stabilizes Smads to enhance BMP signaling” to highlight the activity of
ZC4H2 on mediating BMP signaling pathway.
