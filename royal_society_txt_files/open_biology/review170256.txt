In this paper, Sun and colleagues set out to establish an ex vivo culture model of murine
developing foetal intestine and use this model to characterize the phenotype of AMPK gene loss.
The first part of this paper characterizes the morphology of cultured mouse E13.5 foetal intestine
over a time course of 10 days using brightfield imaging and immunofluorescent staining. The
authors then went on to use this ex vivo model to track LGR5+ cell derived epithelial progeny ex
vivo via lineage tracing. Finally, the phenotype of an AMPKa1-KO murine foetal gut is observed
in this culture system
Although the authors' approach to develop a cost-effective intestinal ex vivo model which
includes all cell types of the intestine is of general interest, there is a discrepancy between the
conclusions reached and the actual data provided. Additionally, the methodological approach
used largely relies on imaging (i.e. brightfield and immunostaining) with a lack of quantitative
validation.
Among several limitations of this paper, the main points requiring further attention are:
- In order to proof that the model system is suitable, more data needs to be provided
demonstrating cell viability (by assessing tissue necrosis and cell death) in the explant at baseline
as well as following ex-vivo culture. In fact, based on the images, it appears that the epithelium,
the development of which the authors seek to model in vitro, becomes damaged after a week in
culture (Fig 1-3); whilst surviving cells spread out on the plate as typical for any epithelial cells in
culture (Fig 1 and 4)
-Despite the fact that peristalsis of the explant could be observed, indicating a muscle layer
functionality, there is no data that the epithelial cell layer remains functional and/or viable in
culture.
- Though some differentiation and migration of epithelial cells is shown via imaging, there is no
evidence provided that this would follow a developmental progression. Indeed, this is a critical
aspect and needs to be addressed prior to claiming that this model is suitable for studying
epithelial cell development.
-The rather interesting finding with regards to the phenotype of AMPK loss was published by
this group before in adult mice, and some of the features seem to be retained in the ex vivo
system despite no data on native AMPK-KO foetal gut is shown to compare this to.
The authors may wish to consider the following suggestions:
- The authors should provide some reference data from in vivo murine intestinal development to
show that their model reflects actual development. For example, similar staining could be
3
performed at different time point in culture as well as on mouse foetal gut following later time
points from E13.5
- It could be useful to compare their findings with postnatal gut kept in the same culture
conditions to elucidate mechanism that are specific to prenatal development
-An infographic of how the samples are placed and kept in culture would be helpful to the
broader readership.
-please provide negative controls for IF staining, (e.g. isotype control or no primary AB),

In the current study, Sun et al describe an alternative method to generate a viable ex vivo culture
of the murine small intestine to study intestinal epithelial development. Intestinal fragments
harvested during fetal development were cultured for up to 10 days during which time the
epithelium expanded (via increased proliferation) and expressed markers for the major epithelial
cell types. Over time in culture, ex vivo guts exhibited contraction and epithelial migration. In
addition to characterization of this model, the authors observed impaired intestinal epithelial
development in ex vivo guts generated from AMPK KO mice compared to WT controls.
Although the growth factors necessary for intestinal stem cell homeostasis and epithelial
4
differentiation have been well described, the niche cells that contribute these factors are only
beginning to be identified. This ex vivo gut model also includes mesenchymal cells unlike
intestinal organoid models that are only comprised of epithelial cells (also known as enteroids or
colonoids). Thus, the authors argue that this ex vivo gut culture allows for the investigation of
epithelial development in the context of a more complex culture system. Despite the novelty of
this culture system, the current study is largely descriptive and thus there are several major
concerns that should be addressed.
General Comments:
1. Entire manuscript requires editing for grammar.
2. All immunostaining figures should include high magnification inserts to better demonstrate
data.
3. Additional graphics within figures to better orient the readers to how the cultures adhere,
grow, and differentiate would be useful.
4. A model figure to illustrate the findings supporting epithelial migration and development
could also be useful to readers.
Concerns:
5. Authors must review and/or comment on the pioneering work by the Wells laboratory
(Spence et al. 2011; all other iPSC publications) demonstrating use of iPSC organoids to study
intestinal development. These cultures are also comprised of intestinal epithelial cells supported
by a mesenchymal component. Moreover, Wells also described the epithelial cells of these
intestinal organoid cultures as being fetal in nature (Development 2014).
6. In vivo animal models have been useful in studying the process of vilification, among other
developmental processes including segmental patterning. Do ex vivo gut cultures exhibit
segment specific profiles? Can this method be used for colon cultures?
7. The authors suggest that the expansion of the Lgr5+ epithelium mimics that of the crypt. Do
Lgr5+ stem cells organize together with Paneth cells as occurs in the crypt?
8. Are nerve cells or interstitial cells of Cajal present and/or contribute to the spontaneous
“peristalsis” observed in culture? Does tetrodotoxin prevent this?
9. The authors should revise comments that generalize observations in ex vivo guts with in vivo
processes. For example, “Lgr5 derived intestinal stem cells “climb” onto the surface of ex vivo
gut, mimicking migrating differentiated cells along villi” and “the contour of ex vivo guts mimics
the crypt in intestine, and the spreading epithelial layer acts similar to villi”. Since ex vivo guts
do not appear to have a defined crypt-villus axis nor possibly the growth factor gradient that is
necessary for epithelial differentiation, it is not clear what contributes to this phenotype. To
better support these statements, the authors should demonstrate whether inhibition of Wnt
and/or BMP signaling influences these processes in culture.
10. Considering their contribution to the stem cell niche by mesenchymal cells, are Foxl1+
present in the ex vivo gut cultures?

Comments to the Author
label_comment_3
While the authors have made some revisions, additional issues remain:
1. The authors suggest their ex vivo gut cultures are an appropriate model to study intestinal
epithelial differentiation; however, the authors have not controlled for the spontaneous
differentiation that would normally occur in a low Wnt containing environment. It would be
valuable to demonstrate that in media containing Wnt and R-spondin (to enhance Wnt signaling)
would affect epithelial differentiation. Furthermore, it would be interesting to show that in the
presence of high Wnt signaling, that these cultures could be viable for longer term culture.
Moreover, the authors describe the usefulness of this ex vivo gut model for pharmacological
studies. Can the authors measure altered epithelial differentiation in the presence of notch
and/or BMP inhibitors?
2. The suggestion by this reviewer for higher magnification images was meant to request
additional images captured with a high powered objective lens (100X) to better show cellular
morphology and cellular diversity.
3. Is segment specificity maintained in culture? Can the authors demonstrate the difference in
GATA4 expression in ex vivo guts generated from the proximal and distal small intestine?

ble in culture.
ponse: Thanks for these comments. We have added trypan blue staining in figure S1a-d for
bility staining (Line 194-196). The main functions of intestinal epithelial cells are forming
riers against external perturbation and absorbing nutrients. The major determinant of epithelial
rier function is the paracellular junctions between enterocytes [1], which has been tested by E-
herin and ß-catenin staining in figure 8a-b. Furthermore, after differentiating from intestinal
m cells, absorptive enterocytes can function to absorb nutrients, and its structural integrity has
n tested by Cytokeratin8 staining in figure 3d. We have added alkaline phosphatase activity, a
estive enzyme produced by nutrient-absorptive cells [2], in figure S1g (Line196-197).
hough some differentiation and migration of epithelial cells is shown via imaging, there is no
dence provided that this would follow a developmental progression. Indeed, this is a critical
ect and needs to be addressed prior to claiming that this model is suitable for studying epithelial
development.
ponse: Thank you for comments. The developmental progression stepwise includes endoderm
cification, gut tubulogenesis, gut tube patterning, epithelial reorganization, villus
rphogenesis and differentiation [3]. Mouse intestine undergoes reorganization starting from
ut E14 [3], at which time point we choose to establish the ex vivo guts to investigate the
erentiation and migration of intestinal epithelial cells. Based on reviewer’s comments, we have
nged the title as Ex Vivo Gut Culture for Studying Differentiation and Migration of Small
stinal Epithelial Cells, and revised the manuscript accordingly.
he rather interesting finding with regards to the phenotype of AMPK loss was published by
group before in adult mice, and some of the features seem to be retained in the ex vivo system
pite no data on native AMPK-KO fetal gut is shown to compare this to.
ponse: Thanks for comments. The previous published study about adult mice focused on
PK loss in epithelial cells. This study focused on AMPK loss in whole guts including
senchymal cells. Furthermore, the AMPK KO ex vivo guts, showing the necessity of AMPK a1
roper peristalsis and intestinal differentiation, could demonstrate one successful application for
ex vivo culture model. We added this discussion in Line 337-343.

t could be useful to compare their findings with postnatal gut kept in the same culture conditions
lucidate mechanism that are specific to prenatal development
ponse: Thank you for comments. The epithelial reorganization, villus morphogenesis and
erentiation, mesenchyme aggregation occur around E14. In the postnatal stage, the crypt
elopment coincides with the appearance of Paneth cells in mice [4]. This study only used E13.5
e small intestines to establish the ex vivo guts to investigate the differentiation and migration
small intestinal epithelial cells. The fetal gut sections at E13.5 are very small (only
inguishable under dissect microscope), which allow sufficient oxygen permeation. However,
lt gut is too big to allow sufficient oxygen permeation and survive for long durations.
n infographic of how the samples are placed and kept in culture would be helpful to the broader
dership.
ponse: Thank you for the suggestion. An infographic has been added in figure 5b.
Please provide negative controls for IF staining, (e.g. isotype control or no primary AB),
ecially if many conclusions are based on imaging
ponse: Thank you for this suggestion. We have added negative controls in figure S2.
t might provide more insight on the role of AMPK during development investigating this
ctly form mouse foetal gut.
ponse: Thank you for comments. The mice we used are AMPKa1 conditional KO mice, which
uced AMPK knockout upon tamoxifen induction. Based on the established mice model in our
AMPK a1 mutant mice could not survive more than one week after tamoxifen induction,
sibly due to the critical role of AMPK a1 in mice survival. Thus, we are not able to study the
cts of AMPKa1 conditional deletion on fetal gut development in vivo at the current stage. The
ivo model resembles in vivo gut development and allows the use of AMPK knockout or other
al treatments ex vivo, which would not be possible in vivo.

Authors must review and/or comment on the pioneering work by the Wells laboratory (Spence
l. 2011; all other iPSC publications) demonstrating use of iPSC organoids to study intestinal
elopment. These cultures are also comprised of intestinal epithelial cells supported by a
senchymal component. Moreover, Wells also described the epithelial cells of these intestinal
anoid cultures as being fetal in nature (Development 2014).
ponse: Thank you for suggestion. We have added discussion on the pioneering work by the
lls laboratory in the Discussion part (Line 280-282).
In vivo animal models have been useful in studying the process of vilification, among other
elopmental processes including segmental patterning. Do ex vivo gut cultures exhibit segment
cific profiles? Can this method be used for colon cultures?
ponse: Thank you for these comments. The large intestine in E13.5 mice is pretty tiny. One
bryo could only generate one piece of colonic ex vivo guts, making it uneconomic to establish
ex vivo model. This might be a limitation for the wide applications of ex vivo model. This study
blished the ex vivo guts to investigate the differentiation and migration/morphogenesis of
stinal epithelial cells from small intestine. However, colon culture would be an interesting
ic, such as exploring the genetic and environmental causes of colon cancer initiation. Based on
iew’s comments, we change the title as Ex Vivo Gut Culture for Studying Differentiation and
ration of Small Intestinal Epithelial Cells. We would like to assess colonic ex vivo culture in
future study.
The authors suggest that the expansion of the Lgr5+ epithelium mimics that of the crypt. Do
5+ stem cells organize together with Paneth cells as occurs in the crypt?
ponse: Thanks for this comment. Paneth cells intermingle with Lgr5+ stem cells, and express
critical signals to dramatically improve the formation of organoids [5]. However, Paneth cells
ated at the surface layer of the ex vivo gut, as indicated by lysozyme staining in figure 3b. Lgr5+
m cells could not interspersed between Paneth cells in ex vivo culture, possibly due to the low
ression of EphB3 [6]. Based on reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised the description in this
nuscript (Line 309).
Are nerve cells or interstitial cells of Cajal present and/or contribute to the spontaneous
ristalsis” observed in culture? Does tetrodotoxin prevent this?
ponse: Thanks for these comments. We have added Cajal (C-kit) mRNA in figure S3a, and
nd that Cajal was not present in ex vivo guts. Furthermore, impacts of botulinum neurotoxin on
istalsis of ex vivo the peristalsis was conducted and added in figure S3b (Line 215-219; 326-
).
The authors should revise comments that generalize observations in ex vivo guts with in vivo
cesses. For example, “Lgr5 derived intestinal stem cells “climb” onto the surface of ex vivo
, mimicking migrating differentiated cells along villi” and “the contour of ex vivo guts mimics
crypt in intestine, and the spreading epithelial layer acts similar to villi”. Since ex vivo guts
not appear to have a defined crypt-villus axis nor possibly the growth factor gradient that is
essary for epithelial differentiation, it is not clear what contributes to this phenotype. To better
port these statements, the authors should demonstrate whether inhibition of Wnt and/or BMP
naling influences these processes in culture.
ponse: Thank you for comments. We have revised related description and added discussion of
itations in this manuscript. Since ex vivo guts have no crypt-villus structure, we deleted the Wnt
BMP signaling in figure 5b, and mentioned this shortcoming in the manuscript (Line 294-
). We also changed the title as Ex Vivo Gut Culture for Studying Differentiation and Migration
mall Intestinal Epithelial Cells.
Considering their contribution to the stem cell niche by mesenchymal cells, are Foxl1+ present
he ex vivo gut cultures?
ponse: Thank you for suggestion. Foxl1+ was present in the ex vivo gut cultures, which was
ed in figure S3c.

mments to the Author(s)
ile the authors have made some revisions, additional issues remain:
The authors suggest their ex vivo gut cultures are an appropriate model to study intestinal
helial differentiation; however, the authors have not controlled for the spontaneous
erentiation that would normally occur in a low Wnt containing environment. It would be
uable to demonstrate that in media containing Wnt and R-spondin (to enhance Wnt signaling)
uld affect epithelial differentiation. Furthermore, it would be interesting to show that in the
sence of high Wnt signaling, that these cultures could be viable for longer term
ure. Moreover, the authors describe the usefulness of this ex vivo gut model for
rmacological studies. Can the authors measure altered epithelial differentiation in the presence
otch and/or BMP inhibitors?
ponse: Thank you for your comments. We have evaluated the gene expression of several
stinal differentiation markers in media containing LDN-193189 (a BMP inhibitor), DAPT (a
ch inhibitor), or Wnt3a plus R-spondin1 in Figure S4. Furthermore, the ex vivo guts are viable
3 weeks in the presence of high Wnt signaling. We have added this information in the Result
tion per your suggestions. (Line 122-126; Line 202-203; Line 228-231)
The suggestion by this reviewer for higher magnification images was meant to request
itional images captured with a high powered objective lens (100X) to better show cellular
rphology and cellular diversity.
ponse: Thank you for your comments. We agree with reviewer that the quality will be
roved if the images were captured with a higher powered objective lens (100x). Unfortunately,
did not have a high quality 100x len to take the good images at that time, therefore, we did not
e those images. To address your comment, we have uploaded images with full resolution to
ke them clearer.
Is segment specificity maintained in culture? Can the authors demonstrate the difference in
TA4 expression in ex vivo guts generated from the proximal and distal small intestine?
ponse: Thank you for your suggestion. We have tested the difference of Gata4 expression in
ximal and distal ex vivo guts from embryonic small intestine in Figure S1h. (Line 120-122;
e 226-228)
