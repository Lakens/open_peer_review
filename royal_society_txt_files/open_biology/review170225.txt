The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signalling pathway plays a central role in ventral patterning of the
spinal cord. Previous work from the Redies lab had shown that the cell adhesion molecule
Cadherin 7 (Cdh7) is expressed in a distinctive lateral domain in the embryonic spinal cord of
chick embryos, and that the dorsal border of this domain is set by the expression of Pax7, a class I
transcription factor that is repressed by SHH. In the manuscript reviewed here, Kawano et al.
describe a set of compelling in vivo and in vitro experiments that conclusively demonstrate that
Pax7 is not only a readout, but surprisingly also an effector of SHH signalling that appears to
function as a highly specific co-receptor of this ligand.
The experiments are well thought-out and overall the data are convincing. There are a few minor
points that require clarification. Provided that the authors address these I strongly support the
publication of this interesting, original piece of work in Open Biology.
It would be good to see the Cdh7-siRNA construct used a bit more extensively to provide
additional evidence that endogenous Cdh7 is required in SHH-mediated DV patterning. For
example, rather than just knocking down co-transfected Cdh7 in Fig. 3B, is there a difference in
reporter activity detectable between control and Cdh7-siRNA electroporated explants? Can the
knockdown be confirmed at the protein level, using Cdh7 antibody that appears to work well in
Western blots? And are the effects on Sufu localisation (Fig. 5AA- AK) neutralised by Cdh7-
siRNA? Can the effects on GliR formation in Fig. 6 be reversed by Cdh7-siRNA?
I find it difficult to see the supposed difference between Cdh7 and Ncdh localisation in Fig.
5H,I,K,L. It is possible that something got lost in the PDF conversion, but to me Ncdh looks
clustered into spots in a manner that is quite similar to Cdh7 in Fig. 5I (compared to Fig. 5H),
whereas the overall Ncdh signals seems much weaker in Fig. 5L. Please clarify what exactly the
reader is meant to see here—a higher magnification might be useful
IMinor point: In the Introduction, the authors state that “this DV pattern results from gradients of
dorsally-enriched Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and Wnts, and ventrally enriched Sonic
Hedgehog (Shh).” To my knowledge the evidence for a graded function of BMPs and Wnts is
somewhat less convincing than for Shh.

Comments to the Author

The study by Rie Kawano and cols, entitled “Cadherin-7 enhances Sonic Hedgehog signaling by
preventing Gli3 repressor formation during neural tube patterning”, proposes an interaction
between the Shh-signaling pathway and Cadherin7 to regulate dorsal ventral patterning of the
spinal cord. Although the hypothesis is of relevance for the field, in many cases data summarized
in the present format of the manuscript do not fully support authors conclusions. Moreover, the
manuscript is, in general, too long and poorly organized. Images are of poor quality and, in most
of the cases, lack quantitative data.
Authors take advantage of two model system; chick in ovo electroporation and transiently
transfected NIHT3T3 cells, for manipulating both Shh-signaling components and Cadh7
expression. Experiments performed in the NT are far more relevant that those in the exogenous
system, and should be shown in the main figures (in particular S11).
.- To propose a genetic interaction between Cadh7 and the Shh-signaling pathway, authors show
that over-expression of Shh (Figure 1) and the Shh- signaling activator SmoM2 (Supplementary
Fig S11) alters Cadh7 distribution in the NT. On one case (Shh) induces a dorsal shift on Cadh7
expression (down-regulation?), on the other case (SmoM2) authors claim an ectopic expression
(over-expression?). Authors need to reconcile these apparently contradictory findings. Moreover,
in neither case, authors show quantitative data supporting either observation, which is an
absolute requirement. In addition, these analyses should be performed at equivalent
developmental stages, and at equivalent hours post electroporation, and should be shown
together.
.- To propose a direct protein-protein interaction between Cadh7 and components of the Shh-
signalling pathway, authors analyze the direct binding of Cadh7 with components of the Shh-
signaling pathway; Shh itself (Figure 2), SUFU and the transcription factor Gli3FL (Figure 4).
These experiments are performed in exogenous systems (L cells for Shh and NIH3T3 for SUFU
and Gli3FL). It is difficult to reconcile the relevance of a direct binding of Shh/Cadh7 in the NT,
since these two proteins are not co-expressed in this tissue. Cadh7 expression is restricted to the
intermediate NT, as shown previously, and as it is also shown in this study. The distribution of
4
Shh protein in the developing NT has been addressed by many laboratories by means of many
different in vivo assays to show that diffusion of the Shh-ligand is ventrally restricted. On the
contrary, both SUFU and Gli3 are expressed within the Cadh7 expression domain in the NT.
Again in this case these analyses should be performed in equivalent systems and should be
shown together.
.- To propose a mechanism of Cadh7-mediated regulation of Shh activity, authors address
whether these direct interactions between Cadh7 and Shh-signaling components might regulate
Cadh7 sub-cellular distribution. However, as shown in Figures 4, 5 and supplementary Figure
S11, these analyses are inconclusive, since for the most part lack quantitative data (except for
Fig5, panelA,B), and in addition they lack membrane markers. These are important points, since
authors propose a functional mechanism based on the role played by Cadh7 in controlling the
sub-cellular distribution of Shh-signaling components, and hence the activity of the pathway.
Again in this case these analyses should be performed in equivalent systems, preferably in the
NT, and should be shown together.
Specific Points.
Figure 1: (panel A) Shows over-expression of Shh by electroporation at HH10. Figure should
indicate hours post electroporation, the representative section shown appears to be older that the
indicated stage HH21. Why is Shh-EP restricted to the ventral NT?,
What happened to Cadh7 expression in cases of more “extensive” Shh-EP?
What is the identity of cells not expressing Shh/Cadh7?
(Panel E) shows an explants assay in which authors claim a Shh dose-dependent induction of
Cadh7 expression. Quantitative data is required in these experiments.
(Panels F-J) show Cadh7 over-expression and Pax7 regulation. Quantification of the GFP (Cadh7
reporter vs/Pax7 (red immuno) fluorescence intensity ratio would be much more informative. In
addition fluorescence ratio of individual cells should be represented by dots at either dorsal or
ventral NT. Moreover, dorsal and ventral NT should be identified by marker expression ie: Olig3,
pax6, Nkx6, Dbx, etc, and not randomly.
Figures 2 and 4: By coIPs experiments, authors show the direct Shh/Cadh7 interaction, with a
Kd=4,8nM, and map the Shh binding domain within the cadherin repeat 1-2 (CDR1, CDR2).
Figure 4 could be pooled together with Figure 2.
Figure3: Next authors test for a functional Shh/Cadh7 interaction by luciferase assays performed
in chick intermediate NT explants that are in vitro treated with various doses of recombinant N-
Shh. Authors should show whether explants respond to Shh addition as expected (statistical
significance of increased Luc-activity) 4nM increase statistical should be shown in the main figure
(not is supplementary).
Figures 5 and 6: These analyses require a combination with a membrane marker to measure
fluorescence intensity in relation to such marker. As shown in Figure 5, Figure 6, Supplementary
Figure S11 and S13, analyses are inconclusive. These figures should be combined, and as much as
possible performed in the NT. Experiments performed in the NT are far more relevant for the
model that authors want to propose, than those performed in an exogenous system such as
NIT3T3 cells, and therefore should go in the main body of the paper.
Authors claim that Shh activation (by electroporation of SmoM2) promotes Cadh7 expression. On
the one hand, SmoM2 electroporation shown in Supplementary Fig S11 only causes a minor
ectopic expression of Cadh7, which needs quantitative data in order to be conclusive; is this
ectopic Cadh7 expression cell autonomous? This is an important point, since in Figure 1 of this
study, authors claim that Shh electroporation in the NT caused a dorsal shift in Cadh7 expression,
but they do not show ectopic expression. How do authors explain the different phenotypes
obtained by Shh- and/or SmoM2- over-activation in the NT?
5
Figure 7 shows a model of Cdh7-dependent specification of the Pax7+/Pax7- NT boundary via
regulation of Gli3R production and Pax7 expression. As previously published Wnt activity
directly regulates Gli3 expression in the dorsal spinal cord, which should be indicated in the
model.

The manuscript by Kawano et al describes the specific role of cadherin 7, expressed in the
intermediate zone of the chick neural tube, in enhancing Shh signalling with a mechanism that
involve CdH7 and Shh interaction. This interaction promotes further Cdh7 association with Sufu
and Gli3, thereby preventing Gli3 proteolysis into Gli3R. The net result is enhancing Shh
signalling and sharpening the border of Pax7 expression that delimits the dorsal spinal cord.
This is an interesting study that offers a new mechanism to explain how the progenitor domain
borders are established in the ventral/intermediate spinal cord.
The experimental design is appropriate and in general support well the results, although part of
the mechanism is inferred from in vitro experiments using cell lines, which leaves a doubt of
whether all the described interactions indeed occur in the neuroepithelium. The different
electroporation experiments in ovo however fit well with the authors’ interpretations, making the
manuscript worth of publication.
I have nevertheless a few comments that the authors might want to take into consideration:
1) Fig 1. The electroporated side of the spinal cord is quite thin? How do the authors
explain this problem?
2) Fig. 2AB, AC. Why Cdh7 expression is shifted ventrally in the electroporated side? Same
figure in X Hoechst staining shows a number of apoptotic nuclei. Is it so? What is the authors’
interpretation?
10
3) Fig 4E. N-Shh binding to Cadh7 should be accumulated at the membrane. The image
shows large blobs of staining, which look strange. High power images would be appreciated.
4) Fig. 5A-G. These images are not convincing. Cdh7 should be localized predominantly at
the cell membrane and not ubiquitously distributed in the cells. Shh should cluster the protein at
the cell membrane and not inside the cell, otherwise the proposed mechanism does not make
much sense. If the authors cannot provide better images, they should eliminate these experiments
that after all do not add much. Similar considerations apply to immunofluorescent images in Fig
6.

4) Fig. 5A-G. These images are not convincing. Cdh7 should be localized predominantly at
the cell membrane and not ubiquitously distributed in the cells. Shh should cluster the protein at
the cell membrane and not inside the cell, otherwise the proposed mechanism does not make
much sense. If the authors cannot provide better images, they should eliminate these experiments
that after all do not add much. Similar considerations apply to immunofluorescent images in Fig
6.

Response to Reviewers:
We were pleased to hear that the editor considers our work to be of sufficient
interest to allow a resubmission. We have now addressed the constructive
concerns raised by the Reviewers and have significantly extended our data with
many new experiments and analyses. Amongst the changes, we have
performed several experimental controls requested by the Reviewers, we have
considerably improved image presentation and provide much more extensive
quantitation of results. Our detailed comments to both Reviewers are
documented below.

Comments to the Author(s)
The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signalling pathway plays a central role in
ventral patterning of the spinal cord. Previous work from the Redies lab
had shown that the cell adhesion molecule Cadherin 7 (Cdh7) is
expressed in a distinctive lateral domain in the embryonic spinal cord of
chick embryos, and that the dorsal border of this domain is set by the
expression of Pax7, a class I transcription factor that is repressed by SHH.
In the manuscript reviewed here, Kawano et al. describe a set of
compelling in vivo and in vitro experiments that conclusively
demonstrate that Pax7 is not only a readout, but surprisingly also an
effector of SHH signalling that appears to function as a highly specific co-
receptor of this ligand.
The experiments are well thought-out and overall the data are convincing.
There are a few minor points that require clarification. Provided that the
authors address these I strongly support the publication of this
interesting, original piece of work in Open Biology.
We would like to thank the Reviewer for providing constructive comments that
have helped to improve the manuscript. We hope that we have addressed the
Reviewer's concerns in the resubmitted manuscript and in this rebuttal letter,
as described below.
It would be good to see the Cdh7-siRNA construct used a bit more
extensively to provide additional evidence that endogenous Cdh7 is
required in SHH-mediated DV patterning. For example, rather than just
knocking down co-transfected Cdh7 in Fig. 3B, is there a difference in
reporter activity detectable between control and Cdh7-siRNA
electroporated explants?
Although Cdh7 expression is induced in explants treated with 2 nM N-Shh (Fig.
1AD, AE), no significant reporter activation is detected in the explants in the
absence of exogenous Cdh7 (Fig. 3A), indicating that the endogenous levels of
Cdh7 expression are not sufficient to promote reporter expression in this in vitro
assay. Higher doses of N-Shh (4 nM) can increase reporter activity in the
absence of exogenous Cdh7 (Fig. 3A), but the endogenous expression of Cdh7
is repressed at these doses of N-Shh (Fig. 1AD, AE), indicating that high doses
of N-Shh promote Shh signalling independently of Cdh7.
In conclusion, the explant reporter assay used for Fig. 3 is not suitable for
studying the requirement of endogenous Cdh7 in the regulation of Shh
signalling.
Can the knockdown be confirmed at the protein level, using Cdh7
antibody that appears to work well in Western blots?
Western blot and immunocytochemistry data of Cdh7 knockdown were already
reported in the Supplementary Materials and we have now moved them to Fig.
2N and O of the revised manuscript for increased visibility.
And are the effects on Sufu localisation (Fig. 5AA-AK) neutralised by
Cdh7-siRNA? Can the effects on GliR formation in Fig. 6 be reversed by
Cdh7-siRNA?
We have performed these additional controls requested by the Reviewer and
the results are shown in Figure S13 in the Supplementary Materials of the
revised manuscript. The effects of Chd7 on both Sufu localisation (Fig. 6K) and
GliR repressor formation (Fig. 6AJ) were largely prevented when cells were co-
transfected with Cdh7-siRNA (Fig. S13E, M).
I find it difficult to see the supposed difference between Cdh7 and Ncdh
localisation in Fig. 5H,I,K,L. It is possible that something got lost in the
PDF conversion, but to me Ncdh looks clustered into spots in a manner
that is quite similar to Cdh7 in Fig. 5I (compared to Fig. 5H), whereas the
overall Ncdh signals seems much weaker in Fig. 5L. Please clarify what
exactly the reader is meant to see here—a higher magnification might be
useful.
We have repeated these experiments and, as requested by the Reviewer,
provide new images in Figure S8 in the Supplementary Materials of the revised
manuscript. These new experiments confirm the lack of endogenous Ncdh
aggregation in cells showing strong aggregation of Cdh7 (Fig. S8D, E, G, H). It
should be noted that, even in the presence of higher Ncdh expression levels
due to transfection of exogenous Ncdh plasmids, no aggregation of Ncdh
comparable to that of Cdh7 was detectable (Fig. 5B, F).
Minor point: In the Introduction, the authors state that “this DV pattern
results from gradients of dorsally-enriched Bone Morphogenetic Proteins
(BMPs) and Wnts, and ventrally enriched Sonic Hedgehog (Shh).” To my
knowledge the evidence for a graded function of BMPs and Wnts is
somewhat less convincing than for Shh.
We have modified this sentence according to the Reviewer's suggestion.

Comments to the Author(s)
The study by Rie Kawano and cols, entitled “Cadherin-7 enhances Sonic
Hedgehog signaling by preventing Gli3 repressor formation during neural
tube patterning”, proposes an interaction between the Shh-signaling
pathway and Cadherin7 to regulate dorsal ventral patterning of the spinal
cord. Although the hypothesis is of relevance for the field, in many cases
data summarized in the present format of the manuscript do not fully
support authors conclusions. Moreover, the manuscript is, in general, too
long and poorly organized. Images are of poor quality and, in most of the
cases, lack quantitative data.
Authors take advantage of two model system; chick in ovo
electroporation and transiently transfected NIHT3T3 cells, for
manipulating both Shh-signaling components and Cadh7 expression.
Experiments performed in the NT are far more relevant that those in the
exogenous system, and should be shown in the main figures (in particular
S11).
We are grateful to the Reviewer for the detailed and critical review of our
manuscript. We agree with the Reviewer that the quantitative analyses in our
work needed to be strengthened and that data presentation in the manuscript
was not sufficiently clear. We hope that both issues have been addressed in
this resubmitted manuscript, where we have included several new experimental
controls as requested by both Reviewers.
.- To propose a genetic interaction between Cadh7 and the Shh-signaling
pathway, authors show that over-expression of Shh (Figure 1) and the
Shh- signaling activator SmoM2 (Supplementary Fig S11) alters Cadh7
distribution in the NT. On one case (Shh) induces a dorsal shift on Cadh7
expression (down-regulation?), on the other case (SmoM2) authors claim
an ectopic expression (over-expression?). Authors need to reconcile
these apparently contradictory findings.
We have performed additional experiments and quantifications to address the
Reviewer's concerns. New data reported in Fig.1R,S of the revised manuscript
show that the overexpression of Shh in a broad domain spanning the
intermediate and the dorsal spinal cord results in the repression of the
endogenous Cdh7 domain in the intermediate region and ectopic Cdh7
expression in the dorsal region. Data about SmoM2 electroporation have now
been moved to Fig. 1X-AA, and a quantification of SmoM2-expressing and
Cdh7-positive cells following SmoM2 overexpression is now provided in Fig.
1AA. These results show that SmoM2-expressing cells falling within the
endogenous Cdh7 domain in the intermediate spinal cord are mostly Cdh7-
negative (indicating Cdh7 downregulation), whereas those falling within the
dorsal region are mostly Cdh7-positive (indicating Cdh7 upregulation).
Altogether, the two datasets show that both Shh and SmoM2 overexpression
cause similar effects: downregulation of Cdh7 in the intermediate spinal cord
and ectopic expression in the dorsal spinal cord. The likely explanation for these
results is that Shh or SmoM2 electroporation causes higher level of Shh
signalling in the intermediate than in the dorsal spinal cord due to additive
effects with endogenous signalling in the intermediate region, and to the fact
that SmoM2 can upregulate Shh in the intermediate, but not in the dorsal region
(Fig. 1AB). These observations suggest a dose-dependent regulation of Cdh7
expression by Shh signalling.
To further confirm the dose-dependent effects of Shh signalling on Cdh7
expression, we have treated spinal cord explants with different doses of the
Smo agonist SAG and found that, similar to treatments with N-Shh, Cdh7 was
upregulated by moderate doses of SAG (0.5 µM) and repressed at higher doses.
These new results are now shown in Fig. 1AF of the revised manuscript.
Moreover, in neither case, authors show quantitative data supporting
either observation, which is an absolute requirement. In addition, these
analyses should be performed at equivalent developmental stages, and
at equivalent hours post electroporation, and should be shown together.
As requested by the reviewer, we now provide quantitative data for these
experiments in Fig. 1AA and Fig. 1AE.
All electroporation experiments were performed by electroporating embryos at
HH st.10. For the majority of the experiments, electroporated embryos or
explants were then incubated until st.15-17, when they were harvested for
endpoint analysis (slight variations in the stage of the embryos at the time of
harvesting depended on slight fluctuations in the rate of growth of different
embryo batches). Embryos were harvested at a later stage (st. 23) only for the
experiments of Shh overexpression shown in Fig. 1L-W. Since Shh protein is
diffusible and can act at a considerable distance from the electroporation site,
these experiments were analysed at stage 23 to allow for further growth of the
neural tube and better resolution of the effect of exogenous Shh on the
intermediate and the dorsal regions of the spinal cord.
As requested by the Reviewer, the results of Shh and SmoM2 overexpression
are now shown side-by-side in Fig. 1, along with the results of treatments of
spinal cord explants with different doses of N-Shh or SAG.
.- To propose a direct protein-protein interaction between Cadh7 and
components of the Shh-signalling pathway, authors analyze the direct
binding of Cadh7 with components of the Shh-signaling pathway; Shh
itself (Figure 2), SUFU and the transcription factor Gli3FL (Figure 4).
These experiments are performed in exogenous systems (L cells for Shh
and NIH3T3 for SUFU and Gli3FL). It is difficult to reconcile the relevance
of a direct binding of Shh/Cadh7 in the NT, since these two proteins are
not co-expressed in this tissue. Cadh7 expression is restricted to the
intermediate NT, as shown previously, and as it is also shown in this
study. The distribution of Shh protein in the developing NT has been
addressed by many laboratories by means of many different in vivo
assays to show that diffusion of the Shh-ligand is ventrally restricted. On
the contrary, both SUFU and Gli3 are expressed within the Cadh7
expression domain in the NT. Again in this case these analyses should
be performed in equivalent systems and should be shown together.
As requested by the Reviewer, we have repeated the co-IP assays of N-Shh
with Cdh7, Ncdh and Cdh20 in NIH3T3 cells, so that all the pull-down assays
have now been performed with the same cell type (NIH3T3 cells). As requested
by the Reviewer, these data are now all shown in Fig. 4 of the revised
manuscript.
Data reporting the binding affinity of Cdh7 for N-Shh (Fig. 4E, F, Fig. S6, Fig.
S7) and the mapping of the Cdh7 domains involved in the interaction with N-
Shh (Fig. 4G, H) are still provided based on COS-7 cells. This is due to the fact
that the lower transfection efficiency of NIH3T3 cells in comparison with COS-
7 cells make them less suitable for this kind of experiments.
.- To propose a mechanism of Cadh7-mediated regulation of Shh activity,
authors address whether these direct interactions between Cadh7 and
Shh-signaling components might regulate Cadh7 sub-cellular
distribution. However, as shown in Figures 4, 5 and supplementary Figure
S11, these analyses are inconclusive, since for the most part lack
quantitative data (except for Fig5, panelA,B), and in addition they lack
membrane markers. These are important points, since authors propose a
functional mechanism based on the role played by Cadh7 in controlling
the sub-cellular distribution of Shh-signaling components, and hence the
activity of the pathway.
Again in this case these analyses should be performed in equivalent
systems, preferably in the NT, and should be shown together.
As requested by the Reviewer, we have grouped together within the same
figure the main results of the experiments investigating the interaction between
Cdh7 and Shh pathway components (Fig. 4), the effects of Shh signalling on
Cdh7 localization (Fig. 5) and the effects of Cdh7 on the localization and
processing of Sufu and Gli3 (Fig. 6). The results of additional experimental
controls for these experiments are shown in Fig. S8-S13 in the Supplementary
Materials.
Furthermore, we have largely expanded previous quantitative data with several
new analyses to provide a quantitative readout for all of these experiments. In
particular, both Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 now report a quantitative analysis of IF assays,
while the quantification of Western Blot assays shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 is
reported in Table S5 and Table S6 in the Supplementary Materials.
Finally, both co-IP assays in Fig. 4 and IF assays in Fig. 5 document the
interaction of Cdh7/Ncdh with Shh pathway components and the different
subcellular localisation of Cdh7 and Ncdh both in cell cultures and in the neural
tube in vivo. The dataset shown in Fig. 6 on the effects of Cdh7 on Sufu and
Gli3 localisation and processing is still based on in vitro assays, but these are
very challenging assays to carry out in vivo and it was hardly possible to
perform them within the deadline to submit this revised manuscript.
Specific Points.
Figure 1: (panel A) Shows over-expression of Shh by electroporation at
HH10. Figure should indicate hours post electroporation, the
representative section shown appears to be older that the indicated stage
HH21.
We have indicated the 48 hours post-electroporation in the figure legends, but
we prefer to maintain HH staging of the embryos in the figures, due to slight
batch-to-batch variations in the final stage of embryos incubated for the same
amount of time.
We have checked again the morphology of the embryos used for the
experiments shown in Fig. 1 and we agree with the Reviewer that embryos
previously indicated as HH st.21 were actually slightly older (HH st. 23). This
information has now been corrected in the revised manuscript.
Why is Shh-EP restricted to the ventral NT?,
What happened to Cadh7 expression in cases of more “extensive” Shh-
EP?
As requested by the Reviewer, we have performed additional experiments to
overexpress Shh in a broad domain extending from the intermediate to the
dorsal spinal cord region. The results of these experiments show that Cdh7
expression is repressed within the electroporated domain, but it is ectopically
induced in adjacent non-electroporated dorsal region (Fig. 1R-W). Along with
the results of SmoM2 electroporation and of treatments of spinal cord explants
with different doses of N-Shh and SAG, these data suggest that Cdh7
expression is activated by moderate levels of Shh signalling, and repressed by
high levels of Shh signalling.
What is the identity of cells not expressing Shh/Cadh7?
To facilitate the interpretation of these data, we have now included a diagram
in Fig. 1K. As shown in this diagram, Shh is produced by floor plate cells, while
Cdh7 is expressed in p2, p1 and p0 domains. Therefore, the region located
between the floor plate and p2, which does not express Shh and Cdh7,
corresponds to the p3 and pMN progenitor domains.
(Panel E) shows an explants assay in which authors claim a Shh dose-
dependent induction of Cadh7 expression. Quantitative data is required
in these experiments.
As requested by the Reviewer, we now report the fraction of cells expressing
each marker at different doses of N-Shh (Fig. 1AE). Furthermore, we have
performed additional experiments showing that similar results can be obtained
by treating explants with different doses of the Smo agonist SAG (Fig. 1AF).
(Panels F-J) show Cadh7 over-expression and Pax7 regulation.
Quantification of the GFP (Cadh7 reporter vs/Pax7 (red immuno)
fluorescence intensity ratio would be much more informative.
In addition fluorescence ratio of individual cells should be represented by
dots at either dorsal or ventral NT.
As requested by the Reviewer, we have a performed a quantitative analysis of
fluorescence intensities for cells located at different DV levels of the NT and
report it as surface plots in Fig. S1. This analysis confirms that cells that were
scored as Pax7+ or Pax7- based on microscopic analysis do show very different
levels of Pax7 signal upon quantification of fluorescence intensities.
Moreover, dorsal and ventral NT should be identified by marker
expression ie: Olig3, pax6, Nkx6, Dbx, etc, and not randomly.
As requested by the Reviewer, we report that Cdh7 overexpression results in
cells ectopically expressing the p0 marker Dbx1 dorsal to its endogenous
expression domain (Fig. 2I-M and Fig. S1X-AC). This suggests that Pax7
repression by Cdh7 can alter DV cell identities in the intermediate spinal cord
region.
Figures 2 and 4: By coIPs experiments, authors show the direct
Shh/Cadh7 interaction, with a Kd=4,8nM, and map the Shh binding
domain within the cadherin repeat 1-2 (CDR1, CDR2). Figure 4 could be
pooled together with Figure 2.
Following the Reviewer's suggestion, the data shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 of the
previously submitted manuscript have been combined together in Fig. 4 of the
revised manuscript.
Figure3: Next authors test for a functional Shh/Cadh7 interaction by
luciferase assays performed in chick intermediate NT explants that are in
vitro treated with various doses of recombinant N-Shh. Authors should
show whether explants respond to Shh addition as expected (statistical
significance of increased Luc-activity) 4nM increase statistical should be
shown in the main figure (not is supplementary).
As suggested by the Reviewer, doses of 4 nM N-Shh are indeed able to
significantly upregulate reporter activity in comparison with untreated explants.
Tables 1-4 in the Supplementary Materials report the p values for each possible
pairwise comparison in Fig. 3 and in Fig. S2-S4. We could not find a neat way
to show all the statistically significant p values in the main Figures and for this
reason we are showing only those that are directly relevant to Cdh7 function.
However, the significant effect of 4 nM N-Shh treatments is clearly mentioned
in the Results text.
Figures 5 and 6: These analyses require a combination with a membrane
marker to measure fluorescence intensity in relation to such marker. As
shown in Figure 5, Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S11 and S13, analyses
are inconclusive. These figures should be combined, and as much as
possible performed in the NT. Experiments performed in the NT are far
more relevant for the model that authors want to propose, than those
performed in an exogenous system such as NIT3T3 cells, and therefore
should go in the main body of the paper.
As explained above, we have combined these figures as suggested by the
Reviewer, we have performed a much more extensive quantification of these
experiments and we have been able to obtain similar results in cultured cells
and in the neural tube for a large part of these experiments. Unfortunately, we
could not include the analysis of membrane markers in these experiments due
to the lack of good antibodies. However, the fact that Cdh7 can directly interact
with soluble N-Shh presented in the extra-cellular media (Fig. 4A, E) strongly
suggests that the interaction between Cdh7 and Shh takes place at the cell
membrane. Given the limited time available for this submission, and
considering the vast amount of data that are already included in this manuscript,
we believe that a more detailed characterisation of Cdh7 function using different
assays should be continued in future investigations.
Authors claim that Shh activation (by electroporation of SmoM2)
promotes Cadh7 expression. On the one hand, SmoM2 electroporation
shown in Supplementary Fig S11 only causes a minor ectopic expression
of Cadh7, which needs quantitative data in order to be conclusive; is this
ectopic Cadh7 expression cell autonomous? This is an important point,
since in Figure 1 of this study, authors claim that Shh electroporation in
the NT caused a dorsal shift in Cadh7 expression, but they do not show
ectopic expression. How do authors explain the different phenotypes
obtained by Shh- and/or SmoM2- over-activation in the NT?
As explained above, we have included new data to show that both Shh and
SmoM2 affect Cdh7 expression in a similar, location-dependent manner and
that, in particular, Shh electroporation in the intermediate-dorsal neural tube
can promote ectopic Cdh7 expression in the dorsal spinal cord region.
Figure 7 shows a model of Cdh7-dependent specification of the
Pax7+/Pax7- NT boundary via regulation of Gli3R production and Pax7
expression. As previously published Wnt activity directly regulates Gli3
expression in the dorsal spinal cord, which should be indicated in the
model.
