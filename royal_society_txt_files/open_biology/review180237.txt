Manuscript titled: "Brief history of thylakoid biogenesis by Irene Annabel Mechela, Serena
Schwenkert, and Jürgen Soll is a review on research on the thylakoid membrane biogenesis and
its structure, both in evolutionary and historical aspects.
1) "The introduction" gives an overall information on the importance of photosynthesis and on
the endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts.
2) "The Chloroplast differentiation - in the beginning, is the proplastid" is an overview of
research dealing with differentiation of chloroplasts from proplastids or through the stage of
etioplasts to mature chloroplasts, in historical aspects of discoveries till the recent times.
This part is interestingly written; especially valuable is the description of the connection of
chloroplast photomorphogenesis with the leaf primordium development. This manuscript also
takes into account a recent important result of Gügel and Soll, 2017, that chloroplast
differentiation exhibits a developmental gradient along the leaf blade not only in
monocotyledons but also in dicotyledons.
3) "From rolls of coins to reality – unraveling thylakoid morphology". In this part the authors,
present, from the historical perspective, investigations dealing with the thylakoid system
structure, composition, and spatial arrangement. It is important that the authors connect the
thylakoid structure with membrane composition.
4) "The big mystery of thylakoid biogenesis" presents an evolutionary aspect of the formation of
advanced and specialized membrane compartments from cyanobacteria, through green algae to
land plants. The interesting point is the existence of three possible ways of connection and
transfer of proteins between inner the plastid envelope and thylakoid.
5) "Plastid vesicle transport". This paragraph is extensive. I consider this as a good element
because it has not been described in detail elsewhere. It is emphasized that plastid vesicle
transport is probably of eukaryotic origin, since it is not found in cyanobacteria, and was
acquired by plastids as a new trafficking system for prokaryotic proteins. Another important
issue is pointing the putative proteins which probably are involved in plastid vesicle transport.
6) "Thylakoid revival – resurrection plants as a new model system?" An interesting paragraph
giving examples of different thylakoid revivals after water shortage leading to reconstruction of
the thylakoid membrane structure and of the photosynthetic function. Perhaps it would be worth
to mention whether such a mechanism can be involved after other stresses.
7) "Conclusion" - is an interesting summary, emphasizing the main points of this review.
A problematic point is the order of citation of Figures. There is no reason why Figure 1d and then
Figure 1 c cannot be placed earlier, as Figure 1 a and mentioned earlier in the text.
Is Figure 2 e performed by authors? Otherwise, the source of these TEM pictures should be given.
3
It would be better to give figure captions in a more detailed way, e.g. Figure 2 d.
Figure 3 - the word “Detailed” is not justified.
Concluding:
The subject of the manuscript is interesting and important for plant biologist, it deals with
molecular, structural and evolutionary aspects of the thylakoid system biogenesis. The
manuscript is clearly written. It is interesting and understandable also for non-specialists. After
corrections mentioned above, the manuscript can be published in Open Biology.

Appendix A
Reviewer 1
"Thylakoid revival - resurrection plants as a new model system?" An
interesting paragraph giving examples of different thylakoid revivals after
water shortage leading to reconstruction of the thylakoid membrane structure
and of the photosynthetic function. Perhaps it would be worth to mention
whether such a mechanism can be involved after other stresses.
So far, the desiccation is only known in response to extreme dryness. We
therefore cannot comment on other stresses, which would be an interesting
issue.
A problematic point is the order of citation of Figures. There is no reason why
Figure 1d and then Figure 1 c cannot be placed earlier, as Figure 1 a and b are
mentioned earlier in the text.
We preferred to keep the Figure as was, but we corrected the mentioning in
the text, which is now consecutively.
Is Figure 2 e performed by authors? Otherwise, the source of these TEM
pictures should be given.
Yes, this was performed by the authors. This is now mentioned more explicitly
in the acknowledgement.
It would be better to give figure captions in a more detailed way, e.g. Figure 2
d.
A more detailed description of Figure 2d is given.
Figure 3 - the word „Detailed“ is not justified.
Was changed.
Reviewer 2
1. Page 2, lines 43-47. The sentences don’t come across well. Please rewrite. I
am not sure what the authors mean by words such as “in accordance”
“integrated” in here.
The sentences were rephrased.
2. Page 2, line 56. “…Due to their unique composition..”. This sentence is
disjointed and does not convey the intended meaning.
The sentence was rephrased.
3. The readability and clarity of the section “Chloroplast differentiation – in the
beginning is
the proplastid” is really poor compared to “Introduction” section. I think the use
of the
language is really problematic here with many odd phrases and sentences.
Phrasing has been revised by the authors, see also 8./9.
4. Page 3, line 66-67. In the opening sentence “to fully mature chloroplasts” is
redundant.
The sentence was rephrased.
5. Page 3, line 70. “…mostly in form of…” => “…mostly in the form of…”
Was changed.
6. Page 3, line 72. I am not sure what the authors mean by “complemented”.
Was changed to ‘transformed into’.
7. Page 3, line 76-77. I am not sure what is meant by “fragmentation of the
stroma in
meristemic tissues”. Do the authors mean that the proplastid thylakoid and
stroma will undergo fission to make more proplastids?
No, Strugger believed in the continuity of chloroplasts. By this, he described the
presence of a primary granum in proplastids out of which “multigranular”
(meaning mature) thylakoids would later on emerge. The fragmentation of the
stroma described the process of starch accumulation which would increase the
size of the chloroplast according to Strugger. This paragraph was rewritten.
8. On page 4, first paragraph. Words like “thickening, “splitting” and
“Strugger’s theory” are mentioned without any explanation of what they are.
Again, on lines 91-92 and 99-101, phrases like “stated” and “considered” are
used without any context or further explanation.
9. I think the authors need to better articulate the historical account of thylakoid
biogenesis research. It is not clear from their writing whether some of the
discussed ideas are current and relevant or discredited/unsupported.
Historical accounts were set in context to the corresponding authors of that time
to ensure better guiding through the different ideas.
10. Page 4, line 113. I think “components” may be preferable to “compounds”.
Was changed.
11. Rest of the sections in the manuscript read better and there is a good
discussion and synthesis of ideas on thylakoid biogenesis. At a few places
though there are some vague use of words and phrases, which could be
addressed in a revised manuscript.
12. Page 8, line 245. “continuous” may be more appropriate than “coherent”.
Was changed.
13. I feel that in section “plastid vesicle transport”, the VIPP1 protein is given a
short shrift, given the critical role of this protein in thylakoid biogenesis. There
is no discussion of the cyanbobacterial homologue of Vipp1 or its absence in
the non-thylakoid forming Gloeobacter violaceus. There is some recent
interesting literature on this protein. A more detailed discussion may therefore
be appropriate for this manuscript on thylakoid biogenesis.
We have added a paragraph on VIPP1, which is now found from line 427-452.
14. The authors mention that the CURT proteins are important for thylakoid
biogenesis and plastid vesicle transport. I am not sure how relevant is it for these
two processes. CURT proteins have been recognized for their role in creating
the tight membrane curvature in grana margins and thus plants lacking these
proteins have large granal diameter. Is it possible that the CURT proteins are
important for the initial tabulation of prothylakoids from the inner envelope as
these proteins can constrict the membrane regions.
We agree on the concerns including CURT proteins in this context and deleted
it from the manuscript.
15. The authors mention that the lack of sightings of plastid vesicles may be the
result of their high velocity. In support of this, the authors discuss the stromule
dynamics. I am not sure how relevant is this comparison because the stromules
are tubular outward projections of the chloroplast involving both outer and inner
envelopes while plastid vesicles seem to originate only from the inner envelope.
The authors agree that movement inside stromules and movement from the inner
envelope to the thylakoids cannot directly be compared. Despite this, velocity
measurements of transport through plastid tubules provide an interesting idea
on how fast molecules are transported within the highly viscous stroma as it was
shown by Köhler et al. that diffusion velocities differ between stroma, cytosol
and aqueous solutions. This was clarified in the text.
16. Page 14, lines 410-423. The discussion on two putative chloroplast vesicle-
associated proteins is confusing. Please rewrite for clarity.
cpSAR1 and cpRabA5e are the only 2 candidate proteins found during
bioinformatics approaches with confirmed chloroplast localization so far. In
our opinion, it makes no sense to leave one of these proteins out when it comes
to giving the state of the art.
17. Page 16, line 485-488. The authors mention “circular membranous
structures” but there is no discussion of the fate of these structures during the
rehydration of the desiccoplast.
The fate of these structures is not known. Circular membranous structures were
observed to be present in most chloroplasts and they are thought to be a
consequence of invagination of the boundary membrane. This was clarified in
the text.
18. Page 16, line 490. “membrane-bound vesicles”. Are all vesicles “membrane-
bound”?
In this particular case no free vesicles were observed that contributed to the
formation of pro-thylakoids. “Membrane-bound” was rephrased to
“membrane-attached” to avoid confusion.
19. Page 16, line 492. “thylakoid precursor membranes are being formed”.
Please clarify from where?
Thylakoid precursor membranes are formed after many of the membrane-bound
vesicles start to elongate into prothylakoids in a first step of the xeroplast-
chloroplast transition. This was clarified in the text.
20. The authors write on page 16 that the revived thylakoids may form with little
contribution from the inner envelope”. Does that mean the desiccoplast
development and differentiation is really different from normal chloroplast
biogenesis. I agree that the desiccoplasts are a good experimental system on
their own right but I am not sure how much we can learn about normal thylakoid
biogenesis from this plastids.
As Tuba et al. observe a clear correlation between the sequential disappearance
of the membrane-bound vesicles and the appearance of the prothylakoid
membranes, they suggest that in contrast to proplastids, the thylakoid
membranes in desiccoplasts are not derived from the inner chloroplast
membrane. They further suggest that the stockpile of MGDG and DGDG (that
are synthesized on the inner and outer chloroplast membranes of proplastids)
in the membrane-bound vesicles in desiccoplasts is sufficient for thylakoid
assembly. Besides this difference, there is strong evidence that the molecular
mechanisms underlying photomorphogenic development in etioplast-
chloroplast transition as well as in desiccation tolerance are similar. This was
clarified in the text.
21. The opening sentence in “Conclusion” section is confusing. Please rephrase.
The sentence was rephrased.
