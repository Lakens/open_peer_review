I thank the editor for the assignment of the review task of this manuscript, and I thank the
authors for their contribution.
This paper describes the involvment of long noncoding RNA Linc00467 in hepatocellular
carcinoma progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms. They provided clinical and in
vitro data to support the importance of Linc00467 in the hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, the
data looks nice and convincing. Some revions are preferred before publishing these results. The
comments are specified below:
Major concerns:
1. The number of samples for normal and cancer is not equal in Figure 1A. Please explain. Also,
what did you mean "normal"? Did you mean healthy participants?
2. The idea to employ two cell lines is good. However, it would be nice to include some
discussion of limitations about the findings in other cancer cells.
Minor concerns:
3. The "Hepatocellular Carcinoma" in the title should not be captilized.
4. The first sentence in the abstract is not complete. Please use complete sentence here.
5. Some abbreviations, including in the title and other sections, are not defined. Please note that
there is no need to abbreviate them if used only once.
6. Do you justify the cells before use?
7. Some more experimental details are required, such as the PCR primer sequence.
8. MTT is usually employed for cell viability assessment, not proliferation. Please check.
9. S.D is wrongly defined in the Statistical analysis.
10. It seems that some set of the data is not appropriate to be analyzed with ANOVA analysis.
Please check.
11. Some typos should be corrected throughout the manuscript.

In this MS entitled "Long noncoding RNA LINC00467 regulate Hepatocellular Carcinoma
progression by modulating miR-9-5p/PPARA expression", the authors did a nice work to
elucidate the role of LINC00467 in the hepatocellular carcinoma. It is found that LINC00467 is
aberrantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma, while ectopic expression
of LINC00467 significantly suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion in two cell lines
SMMC-7721 and HepG2. Furthermore, LINC00467 is found to function as sponge of miR-9-5a
and negatively regulates miR-9-5p expression, which target is PPAR. These results are interesting
and add new knowledge to the understanding of long noncoding RNAs in hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Although the findings deserve publication, some clarifications and modifications are needed.
They are outlined as follows.
1--Abstract: Please unify the verb tense here. Sometimes it is passive tense, sometimes it is active
tense, especially in presenting the results.
2--Introduction: In the last several sentences, please list your hypothesis or study design instead
of results or findings.
3--Methods and materials: It seems that the data for figure 1 come from the clinical patients, but I
can not find any information in the methods.
4--Results: The unit for Figure 2B Y axis is not correct. It will be better to change it.
5--Discussion: Some more in-depth discussion is needed.
6--Figure legends: In some figure legends, the statistical method is introduced, while there is not
in other figures.

Dear Dr Li
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-19-0074.R1 entitled "Long noncoding
RNA LINC00467 regulate hepatocellular carcinoma progression by modulating miR-9-
5p/PPARA expression" has been re-reviewed and no further changes have been recommended
by the referees.
The Editor is ready to accept the manuscript however, there is one remaining query regarding the
Western blot films in Figures 5D and 5E that we would be grateful if you could address.
When comparing the bands in the figures 5D and 5E with the raw files provided, the bands do
not appear to match. We would be grateful if you could re-supply the raw blots with weight
markers. The two PPARA panels also appear to have vertical splice lines as attached; please can
you review this and provide the uncut files or an explanation for this.
Please address the queries within 14 days. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date
please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements. It is essential these instructions are
followed carefully to minimise any delay to publication:

hepatocellular carcinoma progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms. They
provided clinical and in vitro data to support the importance of Linc00467 in the
hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, the data looks nice and convincing. Some revions
are preferred before publishing these results. The comments are specified below:
Major concerns:
1. The number of samples for normal and cancer is not equal in Figure 1A. Please
explain. Also, what did you mean "normal"? Did you mean healthy participants?
Reply:
We thank this reviewer for the question. Normal means adjacent non-cancerous tissue,
we have changed this in the figure 1 and the legend. Yes, indeed, the number is not
equal, as some of the adjacent non-cancerous tissues were contaminated during
experiments, and we have no way to go back to collect these tissues.
2. The idea to employ two cell lines is good. However, it would be nice to include some
discussion of limitations about the findings in other cancer cells.
Reply:
We thank for the comment. More discussion of limitations was included in this revision
as requested by the reviewer. Please see the below for your reference.
“It is worth noting that there are several limitations in the current study. First, although
two human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were employed, it would be more
convincing to see similar regulation of LINC00467 in other tumor cells. Second, only
in vitro studies were conducted in this research, evidences from in vivo animals would
strengthen the conclusions. Last, a larger number of clinical samples should be further
verified for the correlation between the expression of LINC00467 and hepatocellular
carcinoma.”
Minor concerns:
3. The "Hepatocellular Carcinoma" in the title should not be captilized.
Reply:
It was corrected.
4. The first sentence in the abstract is not complete. Please use complete sentence here.
Reply:
We re-phased this sentence as requested.
5. Some abbreviations, including in the title and other sections, are not defined. Please
note that there is no need to abbreviate them if used only once.
Reply:
We carefully checked the entire manuscript and made necessary corrections.
6. Do you justify the cells before use?
Reply:
Yes, the cells were verified by STR analysis before use. This information was added in
the Methods.
7. Some more experimental details are required, such as the PCR primer sequence.
Reply:
The PCR primer sequences had been showed in method.
8. MTT is usually employed for cell viability assessment, not proliferation. Please
check.
Reply:
Yes, we agree with the reviewer on this point. We have modified the relevant writing.
9. S.D is wrongly defined in the Statistical analysis.
Reply:
We corrected this typo now.
10. It seems that some set of the data is not appropriate to be analyzed with ANOVA
analysis. Please check.
Reply:
We agree with this reviewer on this point. Data for Figure 2C, D, Figure 6B, C were re-
analyzed with two-way ANOVA. We have modified the relevant writing.
11. Some typos should be corrected throughout the manuscript.
Reply:
We proofread the entire manuscript and made necessary modifications.

Appendix B
The Editor is ready to accept the manuscript however, there is one remaining query
regarding the Western blot films in Figures 5D and 5E that we would be grateful if you
could address.
When comparing the bands in the figures 5D and 5E with the raw files provided, the
bands do not appear to match. We would be grateful if you could re-supply the raw
blots with weight markers. The two PPARA panels also appear to have vertical splice
lines as attached; please can you review this and provide the uncut files or an
explanation for this.
Response to editors:
We would like to point out that, in previous response to revision, we have submitted a
revised version of Figure 5, with replaced Fig 5D and E panels along with the raw files.
However, the editor was comparing the old Figure 5 with the new raw files.
Next, please allow us to explain the reason for changing Fig 5D and E in previous
revision:
1) In our previous revision, we received the query from the editor, that “The blots (in
Fig 5D and E) are over-contrasted to the point where the background has ‘disappeared’”.
2) We went back to re-scan the original film, only to find that it has been improperly
cut, therefore unable to be scanned as uncropped raw file.
3) In order to ensure the reproducibility of our results, we then repeated the experiments
described in Fig 5D and E, with the intention to use the newly acquired Western blot
films to replace the over-contrasted ones in Fig 5D and E.
4) The experiments were successfully reproduced, and the results were exactly the same
as previous findings. These new films were then used as raw files.
5) We then submitted the revised Figure 5, with Fig 5D and E panels matching the
newly scanned raw film submitted the new raw files.
Second, those “vertical splice lines” were in fact caused by a defect in our scanner,
which always gives a line across scanned files, like this demonstrated one below (the
line is now roughly horizontal in the middle, due to orientation of scanning).
As this small scanner imperfection merely appears in extreme contrast setting, it has
little effect, if any, on our data analysis, so we never replaced the scanner (for funding
restrains as well).
