In this review, Taoufik and colleagues argue for common mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction
contributing to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as revealed by iPSC
models of disease. The review discusses the molecular architecture of the synapse, genetic and
clinical basis of neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases, and the success of iPSC
based models to uncover disease phentoypes.
I think this is an interesting review that will be of interest to a broad readership. However, at the
moment I think it tries to capture too much and as a result the message is diluted for the reader.
The organisation of the manuscript could also be improved to make it easier for a non-specialist
reader to follow and the main points of the manuscript clearer. Some specific points:
• I found the narrative of the manuscript jumped around a lot, and I think the manuscript would
be easier to follow if the sections were reordered. I would recommend the following:
o Introduction to the synapse/synaptopathies
o Introduction to iPSC generation, 2D differentiation, 3D differentiation. Summary of how well
iPSC-neurons form synapses (see comment below about maturity) and how well this mimic
synaptic development in vitro (see for example this paper:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582178/
o Introduction to neurodevelopmental disease followed by iPSC models of neurodevelopment
disease
o Introduction to neurodegenerative disease followed by iPSC models of neurodegenerative
disease
o Commonalities linking the two together
o Future perspectives
• It would be helpful to have a brief summary of what techniques have been used to study
synapses in iPSC-neurons e.g. single cell recordings, calcium imaging, MEAs, gene expression
and immunofluorescence and the strengths/limitations. What should be the “gold standard” to
determine if synaptic dysfunction is present in an IPSC-model?
• There are many transcriptomics-based studies that show iPSC-neurons closely resemble fetal
neurons. Is the same true for synaptic connectivity in iPSC-neurons? Or do iPSC-neurons form
fetal synapses – In which case do synaptic phenotypes seen in iPSC-neurons from late-onset
disease bear relevance to clinical phentoypes? I think the review would benefit from more
discussion of how well iPSC-neurons form synapses in vitro, any controversies around this, and
the advantages and limitations of using fetal neurons as models for late onset disease. There is an
extensive discussion of 3D organoids, has anyone directly measured synaptic formation and
function in these models?
• Likewise, there is a large amount of both intra and inter patient variability in iPSC models,
taken together with the fact that many different differentiation paradigms are used across the
3
field this can make it difficult to assign phenotypes as definitively related to disease pathogenesis
– this should be discussed in the paper
• On Page 12, the authors state that “a number of familial cases of PD are causally related to
inherited mutations in synaptic genes, such as a-sunyclein”. However, there are multiple
genetic causes of PD and most of them are not related to synaptic proteins – e.g. LRRK2, PINK1,
PARKIN: I think it would be useful to include a table of known PD genes, mode of inheritance,
and known function of the gene
• I found the discussion of phenotypes in iPSC-models to flit between phenotypes associated
with abnormal development (e.g. aberrant neurogenesis/neuronal differentiation) and synaptic
phenotypes. It would be clearer to discuss one and then the other, also it should be discussed
whether the phenotypes are aberrant development of synapses, or synapses that develop
normally and then become dysfunctional
• The review discusses neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases as synaptopathies.
I think it would also be appropriate to include a discussion of iPSC models of epilepsy, given it is
a disease of major synaptic dysfunction? What about Down Syndrome, which is both
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative (many individuals with DS develop early onset
Alzheimer’s Disease)
• Minor point: P27 G209S should be G209A, sunyclein should be synuclein

Review of Era et al., “Developmental alterations in neurodegenerative diseases”
The review discusses various aspects of neruodegenerative and neurological disorders such as
Autsim and SCZ and in the context of iPSC disease modeling and synaptic dysfunction. Overall,
the review touches on a lot of interesting aspects, but it’s somewhat disorganized, lacks
references and a main theme is missing from the review—it’s not clear if the focus is to overview
synaptic dysfunction or developmental disorders? If the authors work to focus the review and
take a more scholarly approach to the ideas they presenting here, it could have the potential to be
a nice review.
• The title is “Developmental alterations in neurodegenerative diseases? However, the
introduction does not appear to match the title—the introduction overviews “synaptopathies”
and the use of iPSC modeling of synaptic dysfunction, but barley touches on the developmental
aspect. In fact, the developmental aspect begins on page 22. It seems that the title should better
match the focus of the review. Moreover, its seems that the main focus of the review is more
about overall dysfunction rather than development so perhaps the authors could focus the review
on a particular theme.
• The authors dedicate 12 paragraphs to overview the synapse in the very first part of the review
indicating the main focus of the review will be about pathologies of synapse with respect to
disease, however for HD and PD they overview very little about the synaptic dysfunctions of
these disorders. It seems that these sections should be expanded upon as they relate to disease.
• In both HD and PD proteostasis, protein turnover and clearance are well known to be
dysregulated and protein aggregates and are observed in both diseases. The authors don’t
mention the role of proteostasis in these diseases which seems like a major oversight for a review.
• In general, the authors lack citations and refence properly the ideas they mention in this review.
For example for this entire paragraph on page 13, ‘Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most
common neurodegenerative disorder, ……. leads to a prominent dopaminergic deficiency in the
basal ganglia, responsible for motor disturbances (47) “ The authors cite one paper and is a
review. Another example is the paragraph starting on page 16 “ The information derived from
human studies.. with a specific neurological disorder.” Within a two entire paragraph that
describe very specific ideas but they fail to cite even one paper. The authors should take a more
scholarly approach in their presentation of their ideas.
• The section for “overlapping features in AD, SCZ and PD patients section is very limited and
lacks depth. Its not clear why a few symptomatic features overlap in disease is compelling. If the
authors wish to make the argument that there is some molecular similarities between these
diseases which could be interesting they need to examine and explore the current literature more
in depth.
• The authors have an entire section on iPSCs disease modeling, however they fail to overview
the disadvantage of these systems which seems to be a common theme in reviews of iPSCs. While
these models are transformative and have been able to capture many disease- relevant
phenotypes, they have many drawbacks. For example, the majority of cultures produce immature
neurons that don’t have the electrophysical properties in the mature brain, they are often very
heterogenous and lack the appropriate stoichiometry and circuitry of neurons that exist in
specific brain regions and lack the three- dimensionality of brain tissue.
• For the HD developmental section, the authors should cite the important contributions that
have come out of the Brivanlou, Mehler and Heiman labs.

In this review, Taoufik and colleagues argue for common mechanisms of
synaptic dysfunction contributing to neurodevelopmental and
neurodegenerative disorders, as revealed by iPSC models of disease. The
review discusses the molecular architecture of the synapse, genetic and
clinical basis of neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases, and
the success of iPSC based models to uncover disease phenotypes.
I think this is an interesting review that will be of interest to a broad
readership. However, at the moment I think it tries to capture too much and
as a result the message is diluted for the reader. The organization of the
manuscript could also be improved to make it easier for a non-specialist
reader to follow and the main points of the manuscript clearer.
Based on the Referee1’s general comments, we have made significant
amendments to the structure, organization and content of the review to be
able to focus on how hiPSC models of neurological diseases have helped us
gain a deeper understanding of synaptic dysfunction in developmental and
degenerative disorders. We believe that this has strengthened the
manuscript, the review can be followed easier by non-specialists and the
message to the reader is not diluted.
Some specific points:
• I found the narrative of the manuscript jumped around a lot, and I think
the manuscript would be easier to follow if the sections were reordered. I
would recommend the following:
o Introduction to the synapse/synaptopathies
o Introduction to iPSC generation, 2D differentiation, 3D differentiation.
Summary of how well iPSC-neurons form synapses (see comment below
about maturity) and how well this mimic synaptic development in vitro (see
for example this paper:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582178/
o Introduction to neurodevelopmental disease followed by iPSC models of
neurodevelopment disease
o Introduction to neurodegenerative disease followed by iPSC models of
neurodegenerative disease
o Commonalities linking the two together
o Future perspectives
The manuscript sections have been reordered based on the suggestions of
Referee 1.

It would be helpful to have a brief summary of what techniques have been
used to study synapses in iPSC-neurons e.g. single cell recordings, calcium
imaging, MEAs, gene expression and immunofluorescence and the
strengths/limitations. What should be the “gold standard” to determine if
synaptic dysfunction is present in an IPSC-model?
The section “Functional characterization of hiPSC-derived neurons”
includes a summary of techniques used to study synapses in neurological
hiPCS-based models and presents the strength and limitations of these
tools (Pages 13-16).
• There are many transcriptomics-based studies that show iPSC-neurons
closely resemble fetal neurons. Is the same true for synaptic connectivity in
iPSC-neurons? Or do iPSC-neurons form fetal synapses – In which case do
synaptic phenotypes seen in iPSC-neurons from late-onset disease bear
relevance to clinical phentoypes? I think the review would benefit from
more discussion of how well iPSC-neurons form synapses in vitro, any
controversies around this, and the advantages and limitations of using fetal
neurons as models for late onset disease. There is an extensive discussion of
3D organoids, has anyone directly measured synaptic formation and
function in these models?
In the section “Investigating synaptic dysfunction in hiPCS-based systems of
neurological disorders” (pages 16-19) an extensive discussion on the fetal-
like properties of hiPCS derived neurons is included. The synaptic activity of
fetal-like neurons and how useful these systems can be for studying
synaptopathy in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases is
presented. Similarly the formation of synapses in 3D systems and neuronal
activity in organoids is discussed in the final part of this section (page 19).
• Likewise, there is a large amount of both intra and inter patient variability
in iPSC models, taken together with the fact that many different
differentiation paradigms are used across the field this can make it difficult
to assign phenotypes as definitively related to disease pathogenesis – this
should be discussed in the paper
The point of generation of hiPCS lines for the same disease with multiple
variations and use of various differentiation protocols for studying the
same disease has been raised throughout the manuscript to demonstrate
the detection of various disease-associated phenotypes depending on the
lines and mode of differentiation used (e.g page 34, 36). Also discussion is
also included in the section “New perspectives for understanding synaptic
dysfunction in neurological diseases”. Details about intra and inter patient
variability and the neuronal differentiation procedures are not included as
they are beyond the scope of this review.
• On Page 12, the authors state that “a number of familial cases of PD are
causally related to inherited mutations in synaptic genes, such as a-
sunyclein”. However, there are multiple genetic causes of PD and most of
them are not related to synaptic proteins – e.g. LRRK2, PINK1, PARKIN: I
think it would be useful to include a table of known PD genes, mode of
inheritance, and known function of the gene
As the focus of the review is on synaptic dysfunction and developmental
defects in hiPCS based models with the major body of evidence for PD
coming from hiPCS-models based on mutations of the presynaptic alpha-
synuclein gene, we have not included cases of PD where synaptic deficits are
not addressed as in the case of other hiPCS models. However if the Referee1
believes that this table and a short discussion of these models would
contribute to the review while keeping the focus on synaptopathy, we
would be happy to include it.
• I found the discussion of phenotypes in iPSC-models to flit between
phenotypes associated with abnormal development (e.g. aberrant
neurogenesis/neuronal differentiation) and synaptic phenotypes. It would
be clearer to discuss one and then the other, also it should be discussed
whether the phenotypes are aberrant development of synapses, or
synapses that develop normally and then become dysfunctional
We have tried to separate studies showing aberrant neurogenesis and later
appearing neuronal defects. However available studies are not providing
clear evidence on whether phenotypes are originating from defects in
neurogenesis, synaptogenesis or synapse maintenance and maturation, a
point that is also addressed in the final section of “New perspectives for
understanding synaptic dysfunction in neurological diseases” by presenting
the paradigm of Huntington’s disease hiPSC-based studies (Page 38).
• The review discusses neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
diseases as synaptopathies. I think it would also be appropriate to include a
discussion of iPSC models of epilepsy, given it is a disease of major synaptic
dysfunction? What about Down Syndrome, which is both
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative (many individuals with DS
develop early onset Alzheimer’s Disease)
We have selected to focus on ASD and SCZ models to discuss in this review
due to the significant overlap of altered synaptic molecules with HD and
PD. However we have included a short relevant description of Down’s
Syndrome hiPSC studies in the final section (Page 39-40) to demonstrate a
similar overlap with AD that meets at the synapse level.
• Minor point: P27 G209S should be G209A, sunyclein should be synuclein
These have been corrected

Review of Era et al., “Developmental alterations in neurodegenerative
diseases”
The review discusses various aspects of neruodegenerative and neurological
disorders such as Autism and SCZ and in the context of iPSC disease
modeling and synaptic dysfunction. Overall, the review touches on a lot of
interesting aspects, but it’s somewhat disorganized, lacks references and a
main theme is missing from the review—it’s not clear if the focus is to
overview synaptic dysfunction or developmental disorders? If the authors
work to focus the review and take a more scholarly approach to the ideas
they presenting here, it could have the potential to be a nice review.
The Referee 2 has raised the important issue of missing theme as the focus
was not clear. In combination with the general comments of Referee 1, we
have made significant amendments to the structure organization and
content of the review to be able to focus on how hiPSC models of
neurological diseases have helped us gain a deeper understanding of
synaptic dysfunction in developmental and degenerative disorders. We
believe that this has strengthened the manuscript, the review can now be
followed easier by non-specialists and the message to the reader is not
diluted. A number of references have now been included to support the
ideas presented here.
• The title is “Developmental alterations in neurodegenerative diseases?
However, the introduction does not appear to match the title—the
introduction overviews “synaptopathies” and the use of iPSC modeling of
synaptic dysfunction, but barley touches on the developmental aspect. In
fact, the developmental aspect begins on page 22. It seems that the title
should better match the focus of the review. Moreover, it seems that the
main focus of the review is more about overall dysfunction rather than
development so perhaps the authors could focus the review on a particular
theme.
As the major focus of the review is synaptic dysfunction in neurological
diseases, the title has been changed to match the focus of the review to
“Synaptic defects in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases:
An overview of induced pluripotent stem cell-based models”. However
common dysregulation mechanisms between the two categories of
neurological diseases start to become apparent with the use of hiPSC
models, therefore discussion is still included in the review as it represents
our personal view. We believe that looking into convergent mechanisms of
neurological diseases is an approach that should not be overlooked as it
will provide better understanding of disease causality and aid the
development of new therapeutic approaches.
• The authors dedicate 12 paragraphs to overview the synapse in the very
first part of the review indicating the main focus of the review will be about
pathologies of synapse with respect to disease, however for HD and PD they
overview very little about the synaptic dysfunctions of these disorders. It
seems that these sections should be expanded upon as they relate to
disease.
Studies demonstrating synaptic dysfunction in both HD and PD are
included (pages 9-12, 26-28, 30-32).
• In both HD and PD proteostasis, protein turnover and clearance are well
known to be dysregulated and protein aggregates and are observed in both
diseases. The authors don’t mention the role of proteostasis in these
diseases which seems like a major oversight for a review.
Protein aggregation and consequences on proteostasis for PD and HD are
discussed (Page 10). Proteostasis breakdown in these pathologies is a core
disease feature that has detrimental effects in synaptic activity, however
whether and how the two processes are linked remains largely undefined.
As studies from hiPSC models have not addressed this major question so far
(discussed in page 38-39) we have decided not to include the mechanisms
of protein aggregation and proteostasis defects as we believe that is
beyond the scope of this review.
• In general, the authors lack citations and refence properly the ideas they
mention in this review. For example for this entire paragraph on page 13,
‘Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative
disorder, ……. leads to a prominent dopaminergic deficiency in the basal
ganglia, responsible for motor disturbances (47) “ The authors cite one
paper and is a review. Another example is the paragraph starting on page 16
“ The information derived from human studies.. with a specific neurological
disorder.” Within a two entire paragraph that describe very specific ideas
but they fail to cite even one paper. The authors should take a more
scholarly approach in their presentation of their ideas.
We have now included a number of references to support the ideas and
themes presented here and we believe that we have now taken a far more
careful approach on how the studies and ideas are presented and
supported.
• The section for “overlapping features in AD, SCZ and PD patients section is
very limited and lacks depth. Its not clear why a few symptomatic features
overlap in disease is compelling. If the authors wish to make the argument
that there is some molecular similarities between these diseases which
could be interesting they need to examine and explore the current literature
more in depth.
The discussion on overlapping disease features has been incorporated in the
final section of the review “New perspectives for understanding synaptic
dysfunction in neurological diseases” and has been linked with discussion
on common dysregulated synaptic molecules and pathways identified in
ASD, SCZ, HD and PD hiPSC-based studies.
• The authors have an entire section on iPSCs disease modeling, however
they fail to overview the disadvantage of these systems which seems to be a
common theme in reviews of iPSCs. While these models are transformative
and have been able to capture many disease- relevant phenotypes, they
have many drawbacks. For example, the majority of cultures produce
immature neurons that don’t have the electrophysical properties in the
mature brain, they are often very heterogenous and lack the appropriate
stoichiometry and circuitry of neurons that exist in specific brain regions
and lack the three- dimensionality of brain tissue.
Limitations and challenges including neuronal heterogeneity of cultures and
the fetal-like nature of the hiPSC-derived neurons have been discussed in
pages 16-19. In addition the functional characterization of hiPSC-derived
neurons is now presented in pages 13-17 where the electrophysiological
properties of hiPSC-neurons are described. Finally the section of 3D
organoids now includes studies investigating neuronal activity (page 19).
• For the HD developmental section, the authors should cite the important
contributions that have come out of the Brivanlou, Mehler and Heiman labs.
The relevant references have now been included in page 27-28.
