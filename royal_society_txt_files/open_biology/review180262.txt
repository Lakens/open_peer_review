The paper outlines a set of well-designed studies aimed at providing evidence that TSC1
regulates sclerostin expression in osteocytes. Sclerostin is a potent antagonist of bone formation
and has become a strong player as a treatment target to increase bone mass in patients with
osteoporosis and other disease which compromise the skeleton. This is an interesting area in the
field of bone biology as uncovering new targets which regulate sclerostin could provide new
avenues to exploit this pathway to rebuild bones mass. The use of in vitro and in vivo studies
provides strong evidence for this regulation, although the studies are well executed, the quality
of some of the results presented is not however adequate for publication, as outlined below.
Further, a number of errors are evident throughout the paper in regards to axis labels, figure
labels and references to figure elements, as outlined below. Lastly, the authors should ensure they
have adequately referenced the literature in this area as some relevant findings have not been
discussed, as outlined below. They should also discuss the fact that their data pertaining to
mechanical regulation of sclerostin expression through activation mTORC1 is only in vitro and
requires in vivo validation. To be certain that this is a mechanism, TSC1 KO mice should be
loaded to see I the response to load is suppressed. In vivo other mechanisms may compensate,
these cannot be explored in vitro.
Major items:
1) Reference should be made to papers discussing HDAC5 (Li 2016) and PTH (Wein 2015) as
upstream regulators of sclerostin expression by osteocytes in the introduction or discussion
2) In results section on uCT data the authors state that the mice show progressive osteopetrosis.
This term refers to reduced resorption and given the mechanism for the increased bone mass is
not determined by this point in the paper it should be replaced with increased bone mass or
volume. Also it states that trabecular separation is increased when it is actually decreased.
3) The BV/TV data provided in table S1-3 does not denote if it is from femur or vertebra and also
the values for BV/TV seem oddly low in the WT mice. Are these values in %?
4) Figure 2F, MAR values are odd, they are unusually high so it is possible the data has not been
divided by the days between the labels, 7 days.
5) Figure S3D the label on the graph does not match how the data is described
6) Osteoclast analysis is not conclusive enough. The number of TRAP+ cells should be expressed
as a % of bone surfaces, is this the case? It is not clear form the results of methods. Further, both
in vivo and in vitro analysis of osteoclasts did not examine their function. This should be
examined using serum CTX form mice or examine resorptive capacity on calcium phosphate
discs or dentine. Functional analysis is required to truly confirm the impact of TSC1deletion on
bone resorption. The increased osteoclast number may just be a feedback response given bone
formation is up. This should be discussed. Further assessment of serum RANKL and OPG would
3
help determine if the changes in this pathway are only occurring locally to the osteocyte or is it
widespread through changes in circulating levels?
7) A number of protein blots in the paper are not adequate for publication. These include fig 4H
and I, 6B and 6D, 7 H and J. These western blots should be repeated and cleaner data presented.
8) Figure 6A is difficult to appreciate that the cell morphology changed with loading as there is
no image of a non-loaded plate of cells.
9) Page 13 reference to rapamycin rescuing the stretch-loading inhibition of sclerostin is incorrect
based on the data in figure 6B. Unless the reviewer is interpreting the figure incorrectly, SOST is
still significantly reduced with rapamycin treatment. The fact that in all of the figure legends fail
to confirm the comparison being made for each ** symbol does not help with this confusion.
10) Reference to figure 7J and K, Sirt1 siRNA did not appear to rescue scl expression blocked y
TSC1 shRNA, but this is the interpretation by authors. Again the ** reference is not clear and may
make this clearer to the reader.
11) All in vivo data presented is showing male mice. Did female mice show a similar phenotype?
This should be discussed as sex can manifest its own impact on the skeleton.
Minor items:
Page 5 first paragraph, monoclonal antibodies to sclerostin inhibit its activity but do nto reduce
sclerostin. This should be clarified/ Also
Page 7, paragraph 1 last line “Altogether, these data suggest that TSC1 deletion and mTORC1
activation in osteocyte markedly increase bone mass in mice. Should read Altogether, these data
suggest that TSC1 deletion and mTORC1 activation in osteocytes markedly increasef bone mass
in mice.
Page 9 line 3 showed a dramatic increase of RANKL….this change is not that obvious so dramatic
feels like and over statement here.
Figures 5I and 5L are not referred to anywhere in the text of the paper, this should be corrected
Page 14 line 2, reference to figure 7G and I should be 7G and H.

The manuscript by Liu et al examines the role of conditional deletion of tuberous sclerosis
complex 1 (TSC1) in the skeletal homeostasis. Liu et al show that in growing mice, conditional
deletion of TSC1 results in a high bone remodeling phenotype with a positive balance that leads
to bone gain. In addition, they found that mice lacking TSC1 in osteocytes have decreased
expression of Sost/Sclerostin and increase expression of Rankl. Mechanistic studies showed that
TSC1 activates mTORC1 signaling, which in turn activates Sirt to downregulate Sost/Scl
expression and favor osteoblast differentiation. Further, authors found that mTORC1 signaling is
also involved in the regulation of Sost by mechanical stimulation using in vitro approaches. This
work presents a remarkable bone phenotype induced by deletion of TSC1 in osteocytes. The
studies are technically very well done and the work is likely to be of significant interest to a wide
range of researchers. However, here are some issues that need to be modified before the
manuscript can be considered for publication.
1. “In summary, using a genetic approach, we clarified the role of TSC1/mTORC1 in controlling
sclerostin secretion and bone formation (Figure 9)” in this part should be changed to Figure 8.
2. In Figure legend part, H should be changed to G in Figure 1.
3. In Figure 5 J, vertical ordinate expression should be changed to relative expression of OCN.
4. In Figure 5 M, vertical ordinate expression should be changed to relative expression of OCN.
5. The study claims that osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis are both enhanced in Tsc1CKO mice.
Please clarify the mechanism of osteoclast activities and its affect on bone formation.

We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the significance and interest of our work and the
constructive suggestions to help improve our manuscript. And we also thank you for pointing out
these issues. We have endeavored to address all these issues in our revised version.
Several literatures have reported that mechanical load can regulate sclerostin expression as well
as mTORC1 activity[1, 2]. Loading-induced attenuation of sclerostin expression and elevation of
bone formation along with the SBP surface in severe late-stage OA mice.[3] Loading also
suppressed Sost expression in adult mice[4], and Sost knockout mice have an enhanced
osteogenic response to loading.[5] Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that mTORC1 is
involved in the mechanical load regulation of sclerostin expression. In order to avoid ambiguity,
we decided to delete in vivo mechanical load regulation of sclerostin expression related
statements in our manuscript.

2) In results section on uCT data the authors state that the mice show progressive
osteopetrosis. This term refers to reduced resorption and given the mechanism for the
increased bone mass is not determined by this point in the paper it should be replaced with
increased bone mass or volume. Also it states that trabecular separation is increased when it
is actually decreased.
Thank you for the valuable comment. We have revised the incorrect information in the text. Now
it reads, “Micro-CT analysis of 4-, 8- and 12-week-old mice revealed an increased bone mass in
Tsc1 CKO mice. The distal regions of the femur and the fifth lumbar vertebra exhibited a marked
increase in cancellous bone mass in Tsc1 CKO mice compared with that in DTCL, as reflected in
bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) and trabecular number (Tb. N), bone
volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), as well as a slight decrease in trabecular separation (Tb. Sp)
(Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure S2C and D, Supplementary Table S1-3).”
3) The BV/TV data provided in table S1-3 does not denote if it is from femur or vertebra and
also the values for BV/TV seem oddly low in the WT mice. Are these values in %?
Thank you for the comment. We apologize for the confusion in table S1-3. We have revised the
manuscript and it reads,” Table S1. Micro-CT analysis of femur in DTCL and Tsc1 CKO mice at 4
weeks of age”, ” Table S2. Micro-CT analysis of femur in DTCL and Tsc1 CKO mice at 8 weeks of
age”, ” Table S3. Micro-CT analysis of femur in DTCL and Tsc1 CKO mice at 12 weeks of age ”.
The reviewer is correct that BV/TV values on µCT data are in percentage,and we revised the
description from ‘1’ to ‘%’ in our tables.
The reviewer is correct that BV/TV values on µCT data are in percentage,and we have clarified
this confusion. We rechecked all the µCT data and reperformed our statistic calculations to
ensure that all the µCT data were correct. Then we revised the lable from ‘1’ to ‘%’ in our tables
and we rewrote our Bv/Tv data in percentage ('19.8 in %').
For further consideration, another likely reason for getting low values in the WT mice might be
the µCT scanner that we have used. Values between 17% and 21% were reported in the literature
[6, 7].

4) Figure 2F, MAR values are odd, they are unusually high so it is possible the data has not been
divided by the days between the labels, 7 days.
Thank you for your careful review and comment. The reviewer is correct. We have recalculated
our MAR values. However, the MAR of CKO mice were significantly high. We speculated that the
odd speed of bone matrix production was due to those increased dedifferentiation osteocytes.
Osteocytes in CKO mice dedifferentiated and regained the activated abilities so they facilitated
osteoblasts to produce bone matrix, which caused both high bone mass and odd MAR values.

Thank you for the comment. We have revised the y-axis in Figure S3D. Now it presents as follow:

surface/bone surface (MS/BS, t test, p = 0.0087) and (C) bone formation rate (BFR, t test, p =

TSC1 in DTCL and Tsc1 CKO mice (t test, p = 0.0007). Data are represented as mean ± SD, **p <

6) Osteoclast analysis is not conclusive enough. The number of TRAP+ cells should be
expressed as a % of bone surfaces, is this the case? It is not clear form the results of methods.
Further, both in vivo and in vitro analysis of osteoclasts did not examine their function. This
should be examined using serum CTX form mice or examine resorptive capacity on calcium
phosphate discs or dentine. Functional analysis is required to truly confirm the impact of
TSC1deletion on bone resorption. The increased osteoclast number may just be a feedback
response given bone formation is up. This should be discussed. Further assessment of serum
RANKL and OPG would help determine if the changes in this pathway are only occurring locally to
the osteocyte or is it widespread through changes in circulating levels?
Thank you for your comments and valuable suggestions. We agree with the reviewer that the
number of TRAP+ cells should be standardized and expressed as a percentage of trabecular
surfaces in this case, and we revised Fig 3B. For further osteoclastic functional analysis, we
examined osteoclastic resorption capacity in vitro using serum CTX form mice and showed in new
Fig 2K, and we confirmed that osteoclast function was enhanced in CKO mice.

We also agree on that the increased osteoclast number may just be a feedback response given
bone formation is increased. Our BMD data showed no alteration between CKO and DTCL mice,
indicating the quality of bone in CKO mice remained normal. However, µCT images as well as
analysis data showed increased bone mass, which means the quantity of bone in CKO mice
increased significantly. In addition, osteocytes are the major source of RANKL. Taken together, we
speculated the reason of increased osteoclast number could be a feedback of high bone
formation. Meanwhile, increased osteocytes could play an important role in osteoclast number
increase.
We have examined both protein and mRNA levels of RANKL and OPG. We think those data were
very valuable.
7) A number of protein blots in the paper are not adequate for publication. These include fig
4H and I, 6B and 6D, 7 H and J. These western blots should be repeated and cleaner data
presented.
Thank you for the suggestion. We apologize for the low-quality images. We have replaced these
figures in our revised manuscript and presented as follows:
8) Figure 6A is difficult to appreciate that the cell morphology changed with loading as there is
no image of a non-loaded plate of cells.
Thank you for the comment. In Figure 6A, the 0 h group was non-loaded group, and we clarified
these groups in materials and figure legend. Which reads, “The MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells were
divided into three groups: the control group (no loading to the cultured cells/0 h) and two
treatment groups loaded over 12 or 24 h”, and ”(A) Representative images of the stretch-loaded
MLO-Y4 cells for 0, 12 and 24 h. The scale bar represents 100 µm. 0 h: no-loaded group/control
group; 12 h: stretch-loaded for 12 h; 24 h: stretch-loaded for 24 h.”
Figure 6. Mechanical loading activates mTORC1 to prevent sclerostin expression in osteocytes.
(A) Representative images of the stretch-loaded MLO-Y4 cells for 0, 12 and 24 h. The scale bar
represents 100 µm. 0 h: no-loaded group/control group; 12 h: stretch-loaded for 12 h; 24 h:
stretch-loaded for 24 h.
9) Page 13 reference to rapamycin rescuing the stretch-loading inhibition of sclerostin is
incorrect based on the data in figure 6B. Unless the reviewer is interpreting the figure incorrectly,
SOST is still significantly reduced with rapamycin treatment. The fact that in all of the figure
legends fail to confirm the comparison being made for each ** symbol does not help with this
confusion.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have clarified this confusion in the revised manuscript. It reads,
“Furthermore, rapamycin could slightly affect stretch-loading inhibited sclerostin expression
(Figure 6D and E).” Each ** symbol means P value less than 0.01 and P value are presented in
corresponding figure legends.

experiments were repeated independently for three times. NL, no-loaded; SL, stretch-loaded.
Data are represented as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
10) Reference to figure 7J and K, Sirt1 siRNA did not appear to rescue scl expression blocked y
TSC1 shRNA, but this is the interpretation by authors. Again the ** reference is not clear and may
make this clearer to the reader.
Thank you for your great suggestion. We agree with the reviewer that Sirt1 siRNA did not appear
to rescue scl expression blocked by TSC1 shRNA. Our data showed sirt1 could inhibit sclerostin
expression which was presented in Figure 7J and K. Each ** symbol means P value less than 0.01
and P values are presented in corresponding figure legends. We clarified these data in our revised
manuscript. It presents as follow:

*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
11) All in vivo data presented is showing male mice. Did female mice show a similar phenotype?
This should be discussed as sex can manifest its own impact on the skeleton.
Thank you for your valuable comment. As the reviewer mentioned in this comment, sex does
affect skeletal development all along their growth in mammals. In such circumstances,
experimental objects are required in same gender for most skeletal development studies due to
the impact of estrogen on bone development. Therefore, we used all male mice as experimental
objects for in vivo data in case of the interference of estrogen. We have clarified the manuscript
on page 15. Now it reads, “Sex does affect skeletal development all along their growth in
mammals. Therefore, we used all male mice as experimental objects for in vivo data in case of
the interference of estrogen. Male experimental and control littermate mice were compared at 4,
8 and 12 weeks of age.”
Minor items:
Page 5 first paragraph, monoclonal antibodies to sclerostin inhibit its activity but do nto reduce
sclerostin. This should be clarified/ Also
Thank you for your comment. We have clarified the text on page 5. Now it reads, “Treatment
with anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibodies inhibit the activity of sclerostin, thus improving bone
mass and bone strength, along with enhancing repair of fractures in mice and rats[23, 24].”

Thank you for the comment. We have revised our expression to “Altogether, these data suggest
that TSC1 deletion and mTORC1 activation in osteocytes markedly increased bone mass in mice”
in our manuscript.
Page 9 line 3 showed a dramatic increase of RANKL….this change is not that obvious so dramatic

Thank you for your great suggestion. We have revised the text in our manuscript. Now it reads,
“Western blot analysis of bone lysates showed increased RANKL in Tsc1 CKO mice (Figure 3C).”
Figures 5I and 5L are not referred to anywhere in the text of the paper, this should be corrected

Thank you for the comment. We apologize for the missing information and we have revised the
text. Now it reads, “We found that anti-sclerostin antibody rescued MLO-Y4 <U+0394>Rap
medium-inhibited MC3T3-E1 osteogenesis (Figure 5H, I and J), while recombinant sclerostin
blocked MLO-Y4 <U+0394>TSC1 medium-stimulated MC3T3-E1 osteogenesis (Figure 5K, L and M)”. ” We
found that the Sirt1 siRNA significantly increased the level of sclerostin (Figure 7G, H and I)”

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Liu et al examines the role of conditional deletion of tuberous sclerosis
complex 1 (TSC1) in the skeletal homeostasis. Liu et al show that in growing mice, conditional
deletion of TSC1 results in a high bone remodeling phenotype with a positive balance that leads
to bone gain. In addition, they found that mice lacking TSC1 in osteocytes have decreased
expression of Sost/Sclerostin and increase expression of Rankl. Mechanistic studies showed that
TSC1 activates mTORC1 signaling, which in turn activates Sirt to downregulate Sost/Scl expression
and favor osteoblast differentiation. Further, authors found that mTORC1 signaling is also
involved in the regulation of Sost by mechanical stimulation using in vitro approaches. This work
presents a remarkable bone phenotype induced by deletion of TSC1 in osteocytes. The studies
are technically very well done and the work is likely to be of significant interest to a wide range of
researchers. However, here are some issues that need to be modified before the manuscript can
be considered for publication.
Thank you for acknowledging the interest of our work and we sincerely appreciate your valuable
comments.
1. “In summary, using a genetic approach, we clarified the role of TSC1/mTORC1 in controlling
sclerostin secretion and bone formation (Figure 9)” in this part should be changed to Figure 8.
Thank you for the comment. We have revised the incorrect information in our revised manuscript.
Now it reads, “In summary, using a genetic approach, we clarified the role of TSC1/mTORC1 in
controlling sclerostin secretion and bone formation (Figure 8)”
2. In Figure legend part, H should be changed to G in Figure 1.
Thank you for the comment. We have revised the incorrect information in our revised manuscript.
Now it reads,” (H) H&E staining of long bone from 4-, 8-, and 12-week-old Tsc1 CKO and control
mice. The scale bars represent 100 µm (n = 6)”
3. In Figure 5 J, vertical ordinate expression should be changed to relative expression of OCN.
Thank you for the comment. We have revised the incorrect information in our revised
manuscript.
4. In Figure 5 M, vertical ordinate expression should be changed to relative expression of OCN.
Thank you for the comment. We have revised the incorrect information in our revised
manuscript.
5. The study claims that osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis are both enhanced in Tsc1CKO mice.
Please clarify the mechanism of osteoclast activities and its affect on bone formation.
Thank you for your valuable comment. We have demonstrated osteocytes are a major source of
RANKL to stimulate osteoclastogenesis during bone remodeling [47, 48] on page 13. We
speculate the increased osteogenesis was due to sclerostin negatively regulating ß-catenin
expression in osteoblasts, and the increased osteoclastogenesis was owing to the enhanced
RANKL expression in osteocytes.
