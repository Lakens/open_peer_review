Review of “A battle for transmission: the cooperative and selfish mitochondrial genome” by
Kulcnika and Ma.
In the current manuscript, the authors provide a review of mitochondrial transmission in light of
selfish mitonuclear conflict: the idea that mt genomes with detrimental organismal effects may
persist due to a replication advantage. They provide details on theory and case studies of how
nuclear-encoded mechanisms act to eliminate mt variants with detrimental organismal effects, as
well as complementary details on how specific mt variants may increase their own transmission
at the expense of the organism. Finally, these evolutionary dynamics are considered in light of
emerging MRT practices, especially with regard to how carryover effects of deleterious genomes
coupled with selfish replication may decrease MRT efficacy.
Overall, I found the manuscript interesting and enlightening. The authors provide a succinct
review of many key relevant points in this field and highlight many of the key previous studies
(including those by Ma). However, one persistent shortcoming throughout is confusion over the
term “selfish” and mixing of various terms associated with “selection”. In particular, a mt
genome is only “selfish” if it has a transmission advantage (at the genome or organelle level)
while at the same time causing a decrease in organismal fitness. For example, in the paragraph at
the top of page 7, it is stated that “Of note, selfish selection can be neutral to the host when the
selfish drive is not linked to detrimental mutations.” If an mt variant has a replication advantage
but does not result in reduced organismal fitness, it is not selfish. Below, I have noted places
throughout the manuscript where this is a problem, but I would encourage the authors to edit the
entire manuscript with this in mind. I have also noted many other minor points that would
improve the manuscript, including stating conflicts associated with Mother’s curse more
explicitly, considering mt diversity outside of animals (or stating that the review is animal
focused), and noting the possibility of selfish transmission and replication advantage at the
organelle level.
There are no line numbers to reference, so I have referred to sections, paragraphs, and sentences
as specifically as possible.
Specific comments
1) Abstract first line – remove “evolutionary”
2) “Host” is used throughout the abstract and at many points in the manuscript, but I don’t think
3
this is quite appropriate considering that the mt predecessor is long gone and the “host” is really
a chimera of the original two partners. Consider switching this to “organism” or “individual”.
3) Abstract – last line. Considering that MRT plays a major role in the manuscript, I suggest
defining it more explicitly and in more detail in the abstract for readers not familiar with it.
Background
4) 1st paragraph. It is implied in these first lines that the original mt host cell was an early
eukaryote, although this is contentious and many think it was an archaeon (e.g., Martin’s
hydrogen hypothesis). I suggest rephrasing to something a bit more ambiguous such as
“acquired early in eukaryotic evolution” to avoid going into this controversy.
5) Similarly, the idea that the mt genome provided a “monumental” upgrade to the energy
supply of early eukaryotes is contentious. If this statement remains, I suggest at least citing some
of Nick Lane’s papers espousing this idea (e.g., Lane 2014 Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol), or
adding a caveat such as “possibly” and also citing some opposing viewpoints (e.g., Lynch and
Marinov 2015 PNAS).
6) Figure 1 – while I agree that the human mt genome is largely representative of mammals, there
is an incredible amount of diversity in mt genome content and organization in insects and in
eukaryotes more broadly. I suggest the authors acknowledge this explicitly and make the
concession that the review is focused mainly on bilaterian animal mt genomes. Possibly also cite
Smith and Keeling 2015 for those interested in examining this diversity.
7) In Fig 1 caption – about how many nuclear grey genes are there in the ETC compared with the
13 mt genes?
8) “As such, mtDNA does not have to face any heredity competitors” – make it clear that
heteroplasmy can arise via inheritance of a heteroplasmic pool of mtDNA from the mother as
well as mutation and biparental inheritance. However, the point that maternal inheritance acts to
limit heteroplasmy is well taken.
9) “Theoretically the high mutation rate” – again, this is biased to bilaterian animals. Corals and
most plants actually have low mt mutation rates. Make this clear.
10) “paternal leakage” – probably needs to be defined and contrasted with “biparental
inheritance”
11) The last sentence here on DUI molluscs is too brief to give readers a proper introduction. I
suggest either removing mention of DUI or adding a few sentences, making it clear that this
system is still being investigated, but it seems that heteroplasmy is common at different levels in
at least some male somatic (but not gonadal) tissues.
12) “Heteroplasmy represents a dynamic and constantly changing…” these few sentences need to
have citations backing them up and should also be a bit less definitive, adding caveats such as
“can” and “may”, given that the rest of the paper is citing examples where mt genome
transmission is anything but random.
13) Top of page 3 – change “selections” to “selection”
14) Next paragraph – change “recently emerged” to “emerging”
4
15) Last paragraphs in this section and in Fig. 2 caption – change “selections” to “levels of
selection”
16) Fig 2 – I think the cartoon doesn’t represent “random segregation” as I understand it. I think
this refers to the random transmission of organelles to the next generation, not genomes. I suggest
changing it so that the same 3 organelles are present in the next generation, but at variable
proportions. Alternatively, it might be useful to divide into “organelle” vs “genome” levels and
show how proportions can change within a cell at these different levels. Finally, the “bottleneck”
on the left corresponds to a new generation, but it is unclear whether this applies across the
figure. I suggest adding a horizontal line to make it clear where F0 transitions to F1.
Host-beneficial purifying selection
17) See previous comments about rephrasing the title of this section – maybe to “Selection for
organismal fitness”
18) “The nuclear genome is thus interested in passing on…” I think this sentence is a bit
misleading and would be phrased better in terms of mtDNA that benefits organismal fitness
19) “Given that the nuclear genome…” change “all” in this sentence to “most” or rephrase to be
clear only non-OXPHOS activities are being considered
20) 3rd paragraph “This reduction in mtDNA copy number…” in this sentence do the “large
shifts” tend to be toward less or more heteroplasmy?
21) 4th paragraph “In Drosophila, there is also evidence linking…” in this sentence the main
point is that the nucleus will tend to replicate functional mtDNA copies over deleterious ones.
However, a common nuclear response to OXPHOS deficiency may be to increase mtDNA copy
number. Therefore, defective mtDNA may actually be propagated preferentially by the nucleus.
This concept needs to be mentioned. There is some empirical evidence for this in the Gitschlag et
al. reference that is already cited, and some evidence based on modeling as well (Capps et al.
2003 J. Theor. Biol.; Chinnery et al. 1999 Am. J. Hum. Genet.; Tam et al. 2015 Plos Comput. Biol.)
22) In the next line, it is not clear that the mt:COI mutant is actually selfish. It is deleterious, but
does it have a transmission advantage? This should be discussed here when it is first introduced.
23) 5th paragraph “In a study using D. melanogaster heteroplasmic for both…” does “deletion
molecules” refer to organelles or genomes? If the latter, rephrase to “deletion-bearing mt
genomes”.
24) 6th paragraph – similarly here, it is not clear whether these mt mutations are selfish or just
deleterious. Also in this paragraph, there is a lot of mention of purifying selection not taking
place. Its not that purifying selection is absent (if the mutations are deleterious than by definition
they are evolving under purifying selection), it just might not be strong/efficient enough to
eliminate them.
Selfish selection
25) 2nd paragraph first/second sentence – this is another sentence in which the muddled
definition of “selfish” comes through. By definition a mt genome must be deleterious to
organismal fitness to be selfish.
5
26) 3rd paragraph “A recent study suggested that uaDf5…” Again, mention here that it appears
this mutation “hijacks” the replication control mechanisms and proliferates because it reduces
OXPHOS function.
27) 4th paragraph – I think a key takeaway here is whether a mt genome has a replication
advantage or not depends on what other mt genomes its competing against. Therefore, while the
mt:COI mutation may be deleterious in any context, it only has a replication advantage in certain
situations. The recombination result is very interesting and also suggests that the replication
advantage mutation and the deleterious mutation are not necessarily the same in all cases, but
may be effectively linked due to the non-recombination of the mt genome. Make this clear – that
the “selfish” quality of an mt genome may be due to multiple linked variants.
28) 5th paragraph – is a takeaway here that nuclear background also matters as to whether a mt
genome has a replication advantage or is deleterious? “Interestingly, mtDNA from D.
mauritiana…” in this sentence it is not clear that the foreign mtDNA is selfish, does it have any
deleterious effects?
29) 6th paragraph – as mentioned above, the first sentence muddies the definition of selfish –
non-deleterious mt genomes cannot be selfish.
The interplay of different selections at multiple levels
30) 1st paragraph – here and throughout, consider whether the terms “purifying” and “selfish”
selection might be better replaced with “organismal selection” and “selection for replication” or
something similar that indicates the difference in levels of selection.
31) 1st paragraph – paternal leakage is quite common in some plant lineages, and has even been
observed at high levels in Drosophila (e.g., Birky 1995 PNAS; James and Ballard 2003 Genetics)
32) 2nd paragraph – “This can happen if the selfish drive only…” does “small” in this sentence
imply that if the variant gives a very strong replication advantage they will never reach high
levels? It is a bit confusing.
33) 2nd paragraph – “Selfish selection mainly occurs at the genome level, whereas…” it is unclear
to me why selfish conflict could not occur at the organelle level as well as the genome level.
Couldn’t a mt variant cause mitochondrial organelle proliferation, but result in less fit organelles
as well? Possibly by manipulating membrane or fission cycles? Is there evidence for this?
34) Fig 3. – at the top right, I suggest adding a comparative panel with a male beneficial mutation
to show that because males do not transmit mt genomes, both mt genomes will reach the same
level in the next generation regardless of their effects on males.
35) 3rd paragraph beginning with “The nuclear background can influence the strength of
purifying…” The entire point of this paragraph was unclear to me. It is unclear what is meant by
“levels of proteins” “nuclear isoforms” or “this would reduce the need and strength of purifying
selection”. There may be important points in this paragraph, but it was largely confusing to me
what the authors were trying to get across.
Heteroplasmy and mitochondrial replacement therapy
36) 1st paragraph – I think there are actually a handful of three-parent babies that are now
teenagers. These procedures were done illegally I believe and are not well-documented, but I
6
think the authors should look into this and make this sentence reflect the history or MRT,
although I’m sure it’s a bit murky. See this popular article:
https://slate.com/technology/2016/02/three-parent-babies-have-been-here-since-the-late-
90s.html
37) Last paragraph – “If we can make sure that the…” the idea of selecting a donor with an mt
genome that will have a replication advantage is really interesting, but you might want to
reiterate here that mitonuclear interactions might want to also be considered in selecting a donor.
For example, an ideal donor would have a mt genome that is compatible with the patient’s
nuclear DNA and has a replication advantage against its defective mtDNA.
38) One thing that isn’t clear in this last section is why does carryover occur at all? Is this just
because the laboratory techniques are imperfect and a bit of the patient’s cytoplasm with some
mitochondria is always taken by accident? Would there be a way to eradicate the patient’s
cytoplasm/mt genomes prior to adding the donor cytoplasm?

Title:
A battle for transmission: the cooperative and selfish mitochondrial genome
7
Authors:
Anna Klucnika and Hansong Ma
Summary:
In this manuscript, Klucnika and Ma review selfish behavior of mitochondrial genomes in
bilaterian animals, with especial focus on human mitochondrial dynamics. The review discusses
a variety of related topics, including heteroplasmy, selection, drift, and bottlenecking in the
oocyte. Notably, the evidence described, while thoroughly researched, is restricted to bilaterian
animals. This choice has the unintended effects of both limiting the topic to a relatively narrow
section of mitochondrial diversity, and trying to pigeonhole mitochondrial biology of nematodes
and insects onto humans.
Overall, I found the topic to be of broad interest to the readership of Open Biology, and if
it is recast and re-titled to focus more narrowly on heteroplasmy in bilaterians, to be quite well
done. I also think the manuscript could use more careful editing, as there were sever language
usages that I found odd and unclear. Personally, I find the focus on MRT to be less interesting
than the dynamics of heteroplasmy, but the authors do provide a novel perspective on it.
Assuming the authors can narrow the scope of their review and address a couple other minor
issues, I think this manuscript would make for a nice contribution to Open Biology.
Major Concerns:
1. Framing of the manuscript. The manuscript in its current state is framed as a broad look into
mitochondrial biology; however, little if any of the references discuss mitochondrial biology
outside of mammals, nematodes, and insects. This choice to ignore the vast majority of
mitochondrial biology while trying to draw broad conclusions is odd. Much of what the authors
are trying to discuss has been researched extensively in other taxa, especially plants, but no credit
is given to the work done in that field. For example, mitochondrial genomes often experience
rampant recombination, varying degrees of biparental inheritance exist in non-bilaterian lineages,
and mutation rate varies orders of magnitude across taxonomic groups, even within metazoa.
This, as one might imagine, has profound consequences for mitochondrial biology, especially
with respect to the presumed mutational meltdown mitochondrial genomes are supposed to
experience. Accordingly, the authors need to either broaden their literature scope considerably or
restrict their observations to bilaterian animals. I have also included a couple citations below
whose inclusion would help improve the manuscript, even if the focus becomes narrower.
2. Emphasis on purifying selection/genetic drift. The section describing the forces that can affect
mitochondrial genome evolution and selfish mitochondrial genome proliferation was overly
simplistic. While purifying selection can and does play a major role in mitochondrial genome
evolution, the authors neglect entirely the role of positive selection in mitochondrial biology. A
poignant example can be glimpsed in mitochondria present in populations that have migrated to
low-oxygen conditions (e.g., high elevation) relative to their ancestors and/or close relatives.
While the mitochondrial genome is small and rates of recombination are low, beneficial
mutations can still experience positive selection, especially when mitochondria are poorly
adapted to local environmental conditions (i.e., when fitness effects of mutations are large).
While much of the manuscript was well done, I have a couple additional minor comments that
the authors might consider to improve their manuscript.
• Page 2, when describing the genetic content of mitochondrial genomes. Note that this section
applies exclusively to bilaterians. Mitochondrial genomes of non-bilaterians can differ quite
dramatically from those of the systems that are the focus of the present study (e.g., SDH is
commonly still mitochondrially encoded in many plant lineages)
• Similarly, the point about high mutation rates des not apply beyond bilaterians. See Lavrov and
Pett for a nice review on metazoan mitochondrial genome diversity.
8
• First paragraph of page 3 – “so the genome is under the strong influence of genetic drift”. I
think a lot of mitochondrial researchers would object strongly to this, absent some contextual
justification. See Konrad et al. 2017 for a contradictory opinion.
• There is a repeated use of the term “selections”. I believe it would be better to say “types of
selection”.
• Page 4 “The nuclear genome is thus interested in…”. This is another problematic sentence
formulation. The nuclear genome is not interested in anything. Nuclear genomes that successfully
coordinate mitochondrial expression/replication/transmission have higher fitness than nuclear
genomes that do not.
• Cite Holland et al. 2018 on page 4 somewhere.
• “Limited recombination has little power to remove de novo mutations”. I do not believe this
statement to be factually correct. See Neiman and Taylor 2009. Only a little bit of recombination is
necessary to reset Muller’s Ratchet.
• I think the phrase “selfish selection” is odd. I would change to “Selfish proliferation”. While
selection can act at the level of the replicator (i.e., rapid/efficiently replicating mtDNA molecules
have a fitness advantage over slowly replicating mtDNA molecules), I think the phrasing here
sparks of some active role of the molecule in its own selection. The term “proliferation” better
encapsulates the phenomenon.
• The lack of any information about cytoplasmic male sterility in plants seems a glaring omission
in the selfish element section. This is a major reason why I think the manuscript needs to be re-
framed/narrowed in scope.
• Remove the reference to unpublished data from the top part of page 9. Given that it is
unpublished, the audience cannot properly evaluate the quality of the evidence supporting the
point. The resulting conclusion should therefore be removed until the data can be properly
viewed.
• The description of mitonuclear incompatibility and subsequent compensatory coevolution is
not correctly described. See Sloan et al. 2017 for a better description of the dynamics at play.
• In the MRT section, I think it would be worth citing Havird et al 2016.

In the current manuscript, the authors provide a review of mitochondrial transmission in light of

nuclear-encoded mechanisms act to eliminate mt variants with detrimental organismal effects, as

at the expense of the organism. Finally, these evolutionary dynamics are considered in light of

coupled with selfish replication may decrease MRT efficacy.
Overall, I found the manuscript interesting and enlightening. The authors provide a succinct
review of many key relevant points in this field and highlight many of the key previous studies

term “selfish” and mixing of various terms associated with “selection”. In particular, a mt

while at the same time causing a decrease in organismal fitness. For example, in the paragraph at

misleading and would be phrased better in terms of mtDNA that benefits organismal fitness
19) “Given that the nuclear genome…” change “all” in this sentence to “most” or rephrase to be
clear only non-OXPHOS activities are being considered
20) 3rd paragraph “This reduction in mtDNA copy number…” in this sentence do the “large
shifts” tend to be toward less or more heteroplasmy?
13
21) 4th paragraph “In Drosophila, there is also evidence linking…” in this sentence the main
point is that the nucleus will tend to replicate functional mtDNA copies over deleterious ones.
However, a common nuclear response to OXPHOS deficiency may be to increase mtDNA copy
number. Therefore, defective mtDNA may actually be propagated preferentially by the nucleus.
This concept needs to be mentioned. There is some empirical evidence for this in the Gitschlag et
al. reference that is already cited, and some evidence based on modeling as well (Capps et al.
2003 J. Theor. Biol.; Chinnery et al. 1999 Am. J. Hum. Genet.; Tam et al. 2015 Plos Comput. Biol.)
22) In the next line, it is not clear that the mt:COI mutant is actually selfish. It is deleterious, but
does it have a transmission advantage? This should be discussed here when it is first introduced.
23) 5th paragraph “In a study using D. melanogaster heteroplasmic for both…” does “deletion
molecules” refer to organelles or genomes? If the latter, rephrase to “deletion-bearing mt
genomes”.
24) 6th paragraph – similarly here, it is not clear whether these mt mutations are selfish or just
deleterious. Also in this paragraph, there is a lot of mention of purifying selection not taking
place. Its not that purifying selection is absent (if the mutations are deleterious than by definition
they are evolving under purifying selection), it just might not be strong/efficient enough to
eliminate them.
Selfish selection
25) 2nd paragraph first/second sentence – this is another sentence in which the muddled
definition of “selfish” comes through. By definition a mt genome must be deleterious to
organismal fitness to be selfish.
26) 3rd paragraph “A recent study suggested that uaDf5…” Again, mention here that it appears
this mutation “hijacks” the replication control mechanisms and proliferates because it reduces
OXPHOS function.
27) 4th paragraph – I think a key takeaway here is whether a mt genome has a replication
advantage or not depends on what other mt genomes its competing against. Therefore, while the
mt:COI mutation may be deleterious in any context, it only has a replication advantage in certain
situations. The recombination result is very interesting and also suggests that the replication
advantage mutation and the deleterious mutation are not necessarily the same in all cases, but
may be effectively linked due to the non-recombination of the mt genome. Make this clear – that
the “selfish” quality of an mt genome may be due to multiple linked variants.
28) 5th paragraph – is a takeaway here that nuclear background also matters as to whether a mt
genome has a replication advantage or is deleterious? “Interestingly, mtDNA from D.
mauritiana…” in this sentence it is not clear that the foreign mtDNA is selfish, does it have any
deleterious effects?
29) 6th paragraph – as mentioned above, the first sentence muddies the definition of selfish –
non-deleterious mt genomes cannot be selfish.
The interplay of different selections at multiple levels
30) 1st paragraph – here and throughout, consider whether the terms “purifying” and “selfish”
selection might be better replaced with “organismal selection” and “selection for replication” or
something similar that indicates the difference in levels of selection.
14
31) 1st paragraph – paternal leakage is quite common in some plant lineages, and has even been
observed at high levels in Drosophila (e.g., Birky 1995 PNAS; James and Ballard 2003 Genetics)
32) 2nd paragraph – “This can happen if the selfish drive only…” does “small” in this sentence
imply that if the variant gives a very strong replication advantage they will never reach high
levels? It is a bit confusing.
33) 2nd paragraph – “Selfish selection mainly occurs at the genome level, whereas…” it is unclear
to me why selfish conflict could not occur at the organelle level as well as the genome level.
Couldn’t a mt variant cause mitochondrial organelle proliferation, but result in less fit organelles
as well? Possibly by manipulating membrane or fission cycles? Is there evidence for this?
34) Fig 3. – at the top right, I suggest adding a comparative panel with a male beneficial mutation
to show that because males do not transmit mt genomes, both mt genomes will reach the same
level in the next generation regardless of their effects on males.
35) 3rd paragraph beginning with “The nuclear background can influence the strength of
purifying…” The entire point of this paragraph was unclear to me. It is unclear what is meant by
“levels of proteins” “nuclear isoforms” or “this would reduce the need and strength of purifying
selection”. There may be important points in this paragraph, but it was largely confusing to me
what the authors were trying to get across.
Heteroplasmy and mitochondrial replacement therapy
36) 1st paragraph – I think there are actually a handful of three-parent babies that are now
teenagers. These procedures were done illegally I believe and are not well-documented, but I
think the authors should look into this and make this sentence reflect the history or MRT,
although I’m sure it’s a bit murky. See this popular article:
https://slate.com/technology/2016/02/three-parent-babies-have-been-here-since-the-late-
90s.html
37) Last paragraph – “If we can make sure that the…” the idea of selecting a donor with an mt
genome that will have a replication advantage is really interesting, but you might want to
reiterate here that mitonuclear interactions might want to also be considered in selecting a donor.
For example, an ideal donor would have a mt genome that is compatible with the patient’s
nuclear DNA and has a replication advantage against its defective mtDNA.
38) One thing that isn’t clear in this last section is why does carryover occur at all? Is this just
because the laboratory techniques are imperfect and a bit of the patient’s cytoplasm with some
mitochondria is always taken by accident? Would there be a way to eradicate the patient’s
cytoplasm/mt genomes prior to adding the donor cytoplasm?

Title:
A battle for transmission: the cooperative and selfish mitochondrial genome
Authors:
Anna Klucnika and Hansong Ma

Summary:
In this manuscript, Klucnika and Ma review selfish behavior of mitochondrial genomes in
bilaterian animals, with especial focus on human mitochondrial dynamics. The review discusses
a variety of related topics, including heteroplasmy, selection, drift, and bottlenecking in the
oocyte. Notably, the evidence described, while thoroughly researched, is restricted to bilaterian
animals. This choice has the unintended effects of both limiting the topic to a relatively narrow
section of mitochondrial diversity, and trying to pigeonhole mitochondrial biology of nematodes
and insects onto humans.
Overall, I found the topic to be of broad interest to the readership of Open Biology, and if
it is recast and re-titled to focus more narrowly on heteroplasmy in bilaterians, to be quite well
done. I also think the manuscript could use more careful editing, as there were sever language
usages that I found odd and unclear. Personally, I find the focus on MRT to be less interesting
than the dynamics of heteroplasmy, but the authors do provide a novel perspective on it.
Assuming the authors can narrow the scope of their review and address a couple other minor
issues, I think this manuscript would make for a nice contribution to Open Biology.
Major Concerns:
1. Framing of the manuscript. The manuscript in its current state is framed as a broad look into
mitochondrial biology; however, little if any of the references discuss mitochondrial biology
outside of mammals, nematodes, and insects. This choice to ignore the vast majority of
mitochondrial biology while trying to draw broad conclusions is odd. Much of what the authors
are trying to discuss has been researched extensively in other taxa, especially plants, but no credit
is given to the work done in that field. For example, mitochondrial genomes often experience
rampant recombination, varying degrees of biparental inheritance exist in non-bilaterian lineages,
and mutation rate varies orders of magnitude across taxonomic groups, even within metazoa.
This, as one might imagine, has profound consequences for mitochondrial biology, especially
with respect to the presumed mutational meltdown mitochondrial genomes are supposed to
experience. Accordingly, the authors need to either broaden their literature scope considerably or
restrict their observations to bilaterian animals. I have also included a couple citations below
whose inclusion would help improve the manuscript, even if the focus becomes narrower.
2. Emphasis on purifying selection/genetic drift. The section describing the forces that can affect
mitochondrial genome evolution and selfish mitochondrial genome proliferation was overly
simplistic. While purifying selection can and does play a major role in mitochondrial genome
evolution, the authors neglect entirely the role of positive selection in mitochondrial biology. A
poignant example can be glimpsed in mitochondria present in populations that have migrated to
low-oxygen conditions (e.g., high elevation) relative to their ancestors and/or close relatives.
While the mitochondrial genome is small and rates of recombination are low, beneficial
mutations can still experience positive selection, especially when mitochondria are poorly
adapted to local environmental conditions (i.e., when fitness effects of mutations are large).
While much of the manuscript was well done, I have a couple additional minor comments that
the authors might consider to improve their manuscript.
• Page 2, when describing the genetic content of mitochondrial genomes. Note that this section
applies exclusively to bilaterians. Mitochondrial genomes of non-bilaterians can differ quite
dramatically from those of the systems that are the focus of the present study (e.g., SDH is
commonly still mitochondrially encoded in many plant lineages)
• Similarly, the point about high mutation rates des not apply beyond bilaterians. See Lavrov and
Pett for a nice review on metazoan mitochondrial genome diversity.
• First paragraph of page 3 – “so the genome is under the strong influence of genetic drift”. I
think a lot of mitochondrial researchers would object strongly to this, absent some contextual
justification. See Konrad et al. 2017 for a contradictory opinion.
16
• There is a repeated use of the term “selections”. I believe it would be better to say “types of
selection”.
• Page 4 “The nuclear genome is thus interested in…”. This is another problematic sentence
formulation. The nuclear genome is not interested in anything. Nuclear genomes that successfully
coordinate mitochondrial expression/replication/transmission have higher fitness than nuclear
genomes that do not.
• Cite Holland et al. 2018 on page 4 somewhere.
• “Limited recombination has little power to remove de novo mutations”. I do not believe this
statement to be factually correct. See Neiman and Taylor 2009. Only a little bit of recombination is
necessary to reset Muller’s Ratchet.
• I think the phrase “selfish selection” is odd. I would change to “Selfish proliferation”. While
selection can act at the level of the replicator (i.e., rapid/efficiently replicating mtDNA molecules
have a fitness advantage over slowly replicating mtDNA molecules), I think the phrasing here
sparks of some active role of the molecule in its own selection. The term “proliferation” better
encapsulates the phenomenon.
• The lack of any information about cytoplasmic male sterility in plants seems a glaring omission
in the selfish element section. This is a major reason why I think the manuscript needs to be re-
framed/narrowed in scope.
• Remove the reference to unpublished data from the top part of page 9. Given that it is
unpublished, the audience cannot properly evaluate the quality of the evidence supporting the
point. The resulting conclusion should therefore be removed until the data can be properly
viewed.
• The description of mitonuclear incompatibility and subsequent compensatory coevolution is
not correctly described. See Sloan et al. 2017 for a better description of the dynamics at play.
• In the MRT section, I think it would be worth citing Havird et al 2016.

Review of “A battle for transmission: the cooperative and selfish mitochondrial
genome” by Kulcnika and Ma.
In the current manuscript, the authors provide a review of mitochondrial transmission
in light of selfish mitonuclear conflict: the idea that mt genomes with detrimental
organismal effects may persist due to a replication advantage. They provide details
on theory and case studies of how nuclear-encoded mechanisms act to eliminate mt
variants with detrimental organismal effects, as well as complementary details on
how specific mt variants may increase their own transmission at the expense of the
organism. Finally, these evolutionary dynamics are considered in light of emerging
MRT practices, especially with regard to how carryover effects of deleterious
genomes coupled with selfish replication may decrease MRT efficacy.
Overall, I found the manuscript interesting and enlightening. The authors provide a
succinct review of many key relevant points in this field and highlight many of the key
previous studies (including those by Ma). However, one persistent shortcoming
throughout is confusion over the term “selfish” and mixing of various terms
associated with “selection”. In particular, a mt genome is only “selfish” if it has a
transmission advantage (at the genome or organelle level) while at the same time
causing a decrease in organismal fitness. For example, in the paragraph at the top of
page 7, it is stated that “Of note, selfish selection can be neutral to the host when the
selfish drive is not linked to detrimental mutations.” If an mt variant has a replication
advantage but does not result in reduced organismal fitness, it is not selfish. Below, I
have noted places throughout the manuscript where this is a problem, but I would
encourage the authors to edit the entire manuscript with this in mind. I have also
noted many other minor points that would improve the manuscript, including stating
conflicts associated with Mother’s curse more explicitly, considering mt diversity
outside of animals (or stating that the review is animal focused), and noting the
possibility of selfish transmission and replication advantage at the organelle level.
We are delighted to learn that the reviewer found our manuscript interesting and
enlightening. We also very much appreciate all of the comments from this reviewer.
We agree with many of the suggested changes (see the detailed responses below),
which have made the manuscript a much better piece of work. In particular, we have
restricted our discussion to only animal mtDNA, added citations and rephrased some
expressions to make our descriptions more accurate and thorough. However, we
disagree with reviewer’s statement that a mt genome is only “selfish” if it has a
transmission advantage while at the same time causing a decrease in organismal
fitness. According to Dictionary.com, which is the world’s leading online resource for
English definitions, synonyms, word origins and etymologies, “selfish gene is a gene
considered primarily as an element that tends to replicate itself in a population,
whether or not it has a direct effect on the organism that carries it”. In addition,
according to a number of reviews on selfish genetic elements (SGEs) (e.g. Werren
2011, PNAS), SGEs are defined as elements that enhance their own transmission
relative to the rest of the individual’s genome but are neutral or harmful to the
individual as a whole. Therefore, we consider selfish mtDNA to be genomes inherited
in a biased manner relative to the rest of the mtDNA pool without caring the
organismal fitness. They don’t have to bring in a negative impact on the organism to
cause a genetic conflict, although that makes their selfishness more apparent. We
believe that we have made this clear in the revised manuscript by stating the
following: 1. With few constraints on replication and segregation of mtDNA, free-
wheeling intra-organismal competition is likely to select for the best replicator,
regardless of its OXPHOS output; 2. The occurrence of selfish selection is hard to
detect in natural populations, as its consequence only becomes obvious when the
selfish genome also possesses a detrimental mutation; 3. Of note, selfish selection
can be neutral to the host when the selfish drive is not linked to detrimental
mutations. We hope that we have convinced the reviewer on this issue.
There are no line numbers to reference, so I have referred to sections, paragraphs,
and sentences as specifically as possible.
Specific comments
1) Abstract first line – remove “evolutionary”
The reviewer did not give the reason for removing this word. We do not quite
understand why this word is not appropriate here and so we have not removed it.
2) “Host” is used throughout the abstract and at many points in the manuscript, but I
don’t think this is quite appropriate considering that the mt predecessor is long gone
and the “host” is really a chimera of the original two partners. Consider switching this
to “organism” or “individual”.
In the classic view, “host” means an animal or plant on or in which a parasite or
commensal organism lives. However, from a gene-centric view, host has been used
extensively to describe organisms that carrying various types of genetic elements.
Indeed, many literatures have taken up this new meaning of “host”, including the
Genes in Conflict: The biology of selfish genetic elements, a well-received book
written by Burt and Triver 2006. Hence, we think that it is appropriate to use the word
“host” here, as we consider the organism to be the host for both mitochondrial and
nuclear genomes, not just for mtDNA. Nevertheless, we have replaced “host” with
“organism/individual” in some of our descriptions to minimize misunderstanding.
3) Abstract – last line. Considering that MRT plays a major role in the manuscript, I
suggest defining it more explicitly and in more detail in the abstract for readers not
familiar with it.
We are grateful for reviewer’s suggestion. However, after several attempts to define
MRT in the abstract, we have decided not to include such information. This is
because it is hard to explain MRT and the issue of carryover in a few sentences.
After all, our main focus is on how different types of selection shape mtDNA
competition.
Background
4) 1st paragraph. It is implied in these first lines that the original mt host cell was an
early eukaryote, although this is contentious and many think it was an archaeon (e.g.,
Martin’s hydrogen hypothesis). I suggest rephrasing to something a bit more
ambiguous such as “acquired early in eukaryotic evolution” to avoid going into this
controversy.
We agree with the reviewer and have made the changes accordingly.
5) Similarly, the idea that the mt genome provided a “monumental” upgrade to the
energy supply of early eukaryotes is contentious. If this statement remains, I suggest
at least citing some of Nick Lane’s papers espousing this idea (e.g., Lane 2014 Cold
Spring Harb Perspect Biol), or adding a caveat such as “possibly” and also citing
some opposing viewpoints (e.g., Lynch and Marinov 2015 PNAS).
We have kept the statement, and cited Nick Lane’s work. Thank you for the
suggestion.
6) Figure 1 – while I agree that the human mt genome is largely representative of
mammals, there is an incredible amount of diversity in mt genome content and
organization in insects and in eukaryotes more broadly. I suggest the authors
acknowledge this explicitly and make the concession that the review is focused
mainly on bilaterian animal mt genomes. Possibly also cite Smith and Keeling 2015
for those interested in examining this diversity.
We strongly agree with the reviewer and have acknowledged the diversity of mtDNA
in the first paragraph. We also cited Smith and Keeling’s 2015 paper published in
PNAS.
7) In Fig 1 caption – about how many nuclear grey genes are there in the ETC
compared with the 13 mt genes?
We have decided to leave out such information in Figure 1, as the exact number for
different ETC varies from species to species (e.g. human vs Drosophila, and some of
the subunits are putative (Garia et al 2017, Cell Reports)). Instead, we have cited a
paper that has provided such information in the figure legend.
8) “As such, mtDNA does not have to face any heredity competitors” – make it clear
that heteroplasmy can arise via inheritance of a heteroplasmic pool of mtDNA from
the mother as well as mutation and biparental inheritance. However, the point that
maternal inheritance acts to limit heteroplasmy is well taken.
We have changed the sentence to: “as such, maternal genomes do not have to face
any heredity competitors from the male parent”.
9) “Theoretically the high mutation rate” – again, this is biased to bilaterian animals.
Corals and most plants actually have low mt mutation rates. Make this clear.
We have changed the title by adding “animal” in front of the “mitochondrial genome”,
so the review is focused only on animal mtDNA. We also replaced high mutation rate
with constantly-occurring mutations to be more inclusive.
10) “paternal leakage” – probably needs to be defined and contrasted with “biparental
inheritance”
We have changed the way that we describe paternal leakage.
11) The last sentence here on DUI molluscs is too brief to give readers a proper
introduction. I suggest either removing mention of DUI or adding a few sentences,
making it clear that this system is still being investigated, but it seems that
heteroplasmy is common at different levels in at least some male somatic (but not
gonadal) tissues.
We have added more descriptions to elaborate on DUI.
12) “Heteroplasmy represents a dynamic and constantly changing…” these few
sentences need to have citations backing them up and should also be a bit less
definitive, adding caveats such as “can” and “may”, given that the rest of the paper is
citing examples where mt genome transmission is anything but random.
We have added relevant references and “can” in the first sentence.
13) Top of page 3 – change “selections” to “selection”
We have made the correction.
14) Next paragraph – change “recently emerged” to “emerging”
We have made the correction.
15) Last paragraphs in this section and in Fig. 2 caption – change “selections” to
“levels of selection”
We have made the correction.
16) Fig 2 – I think the cartoon doesn’t represent “random segregation” as I
understand it. I think this refers to the random transmission of organelles to the next
generation, not genomes. I suggest changing it so that the same 3 organelles are
present in the next generation, but at variable proportions. Alternatively, it might be
useful to divide into “organelle” vs “genome” levels and show how proportions can
change within a cell at these different levels. Finally, the “bottleneck” on the left
corresponds to a new generation, but it is unclear whether this applies across the
figure. I suggest adding a horizontal line to make it clear where F0 transitions to F1.
In Figure 2, we represent heteroplasmy dynamics during both somatic and germline
transmission. Firstly, we have drawn the mitochondria in different conformations to
emphasise the dynamic network that these organelles form. We intend for the main
focus to be on the mitochondrial genomes and have endeavored for these genomes
to stand out in the cartoon. Secondly, we choose to make the generation transitions
ambiguous because these dynamics also apply to somatic cell divisions. However,
we appreciate the reviewer’s comments as these highlight that these aims have not
been made clear. We have therefore edited the figure legend to improve on this.
Host-beneficial purifying selection
17) See previous comments about rephrasing the title of this section – maybe to
“Selection for organismal fitness”
We have rephrased the title to Selection for organismal fitness. Thank you for the
suggestion.
18) “The nuclear genome is thus interested in passing on…” I think this sentence is a
bit misleading and would be phrased better in terms of mtDNA that benefits
organismal fitness
We have deleted the sentence to remove the misunderstanding.
19) “Given that the nuclear genome…” change “all” in this sentence to “most” or
rephrase to be clear only non-OXPHOS activities are being considered
We have changed the phrasing to “nearly all” to correct the statement.
20) 3rd paragraph “This reduction in mtDNA copy number…” in this sentence do the
“large shifts” tend to be toward less or more heteroplasmy?
It can be both ways. Reducing the segregation number can create sister cells with
very different mtDNA mutation loads. If there is no selection at the cellular level, then
a female can produce oocytes with a very high or very low levels of mitochondrial
mutations.
21) 4th paragraph “In Drosophila, there is also evidence linking…” in this sentence
the main point is that the nucleus will tend to replicate functional mtDNA copies over
deleterious ones. However, a common nuclear response to OXPHOS deficiency may
be to increase mtDNA copy number. Therefore, defective mtDNA may actually be
propagated preferentially by the nucleus. This concept needs to be mentioned. There
is some empirical evidence for this in the Gitschlag et al. reference that is already
cited, and some evidence based on modeling as well (Capps et al. 2003 J. Theor.
Biol.; Chinnery et al. 1999 Am. J. Hum. Genet.; Tam et al. 2015 Plos Comput. Biol.)
For the Drosophila case, preferential replication of functional mtDNA does not lead to
an increase in total mtDNA copy number. Furthermore, despite being unhealthy, the
total mtDNA copy number of flies that are homoplasmic for mt:CoIts is the same as
flies with wild-type mtDNA. However, we agree that this is an important concept to
mention. Hence, we have added it in the “selfish selection” chapter, after discussing
the uaDF5 genome as suggested by the this reviewer later.
22) In the next line, it is not clear that the mt:COI mutant is actually selfish. It is
deleterious, but does it have a transmission advantage? This should be discussed
here when it is first introduced.
We apologize for the confusion. We did not mention the selfish nature of the mt:CoIts
mutant at this point because the chapter focuses only on purifying selection.
Moreover, the selfish transmission advantage of the mt:CoIts mutant only manifested
when paired with more diverged functional mitochondrial genomes, which have very
different non-coding regions. We therefore think that it is more appropriate that we
discuss the selfish behavior of the mt:CoIts mutant in the “selfish selection” chapter.
To make it clearer, we added a few sentences to explain why the ts mutant is not
selfish when paired with the closely-related wild-type mtDNA in the “selfish selection”
chapter. Thank you for pointing this out.
23) 5th paragraph “In a study using D. melanogaster heteroplasmic for both…” does
“deletion molecules” refer to organelles or genomes? If the latter, rephrase to
“deletion-bearing mt genomes”.
We have rephrased to “deletion-bearing mitochondrial genomes”.
24) 6th paragraph – similarly here, it is not clear whether these mt mutations are
selfish or just deleterious. Also in this paragraph, there is a lot of mention of purifying
selection not taking place. Its not that purifying selection is absent (if the mutations
are deleterious than by definition they are evolving under purifying selection), it just
might not be strong/efficient enough to eliminate them.
We agree with the reviewer and have rephrased to “purifying selection was not
detected”.
Selfish selection
25) 2nd paragraph first/second sentence – this is another sentence in which the
muddled definition of “selfish” comes through. By definition a mt genome must be
deleterious to organismal fitness to be selfish.
As mentioned earlier, we disagree with the reviewer’s definition of selfish and so
have maintained our phrasing.
26) 3rd paragraph “A recent study suggested that uaDf5…” Again, mention here that
it appears this mutation “hijacks” the replication control mechanisms and proliferates
because it reduces OXPHOS function.
We have added such a statement as suggested.
27) 4th paragraph – I think a key takeaway here is whether a mt genome has a
replication advantage or not depends on what other mt genomes its competing
against. Therefore, while the mt:COI mutation may be deleterious in any context, it
only has a replication advantage in certain situations. The recombination result is
very interesting and also suggests that the replication advantage mutation and the
deleterious mutation are not necessarily the same in all cases, but may be effectively
linked due to the non-recombination of the mt genome. Make this clear – that the
“selfish” quality of an mt genome may be due to multiple linked variants.
We apologise for not making this clear. We have added additional descriptions to
make these points more explicit.
28) 5th paragraph – is a takeaway here that nuclear background also matters as to
whether a mt genome has a replication advantage or is deleterious? “Interestingly,
mtDNA from D. mauritiana…” in this sentence it is not clear that the foreign mtDNA is
selfish, does it have any deleterious effects?
Here the takeaway is that genomes can have selfish drive when competing against
diverged genomes even from different species – 1) D. melanogaster mtDNA mutants
outcompete functional D. yakuba mtDNA and 2) D. mauritiana mtDNA outcompeted
D. melanogaster mtDNA. Based on the published literature, D. mauritiana mtDNA
showed no deleterious effects and we have adjusted the sentence to make this clear.
29) 6th paragraph – as mentioned above, the first sentence muddies the definition of
selfish – non-deleterious mt genomes cannot be selfish.
Again, we would like to emphasize that our definition of selfish is transmission
advantage independent of the OXPHOS function.
The interplay of different selections at multiple levels
30) 1st paragraph – here and throughout, consider whether the terms “purifying” and
“selfish” selection might be better replaced with “organismal selection” and “selection
for replication” or something similar that indicates the difference in levels of
selection.
We have decided not to change the terms because we specify when we are referring
to a specific level of selection and otherwise refer to selection in general and at many
levels.
31) 1st paragraph – paternal leakage is quite common in some plant lineages, and
has even been observed at high levels in Drosophila (e.g., Birky 1995 PNAS; James
and Ballard 2003 Genetics)
We have excluded the additional information on plants as we have taken the
reviewer’s advice and explicitly focused on animals. The two papers suggested by
the reviewer are not related to paternal leakage, and we believe that we have now
cited sufficient evidence for paternal leakage in the revised version.
32) 2nd paragraph – “This can happen if the selfish drive only…” does “small” in this
sentence imply that if the variant gives a very strong replication advantage they will
never reach high levels? It is a bit confusing.
We have rephrased the sentence to make it more explicit.
33) 2nd paragraph – “Selfish selection mainly occurs at the genome level,
whereas…” it is unclear to me why selfish conflict could not occur at the organelle
level as well as the genome level. Couldn’t a mt variant cause mitochondrial
organelle proliferation, but result in less fit organelles as well? Possibly by
manipulating membrane or fission cycles? Is there evidence for this?
First of all, we used “mainly” as replicative advantage of a mitochondrial genome
would give it a transmission advantage, so we did not exclude other possibilities. No
evidence of other type of selfish genome have been demonstrated, as far as we are
aware of. All the proteins required for mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion and fission are
encoded by the nuclear genome, so mtDNA has little power in manipulating these
activities. However, we can’t exclude possibilities where a selfish detrimental genome
may indirectly lead to an increased total mitochondrial mass to compensate for the
reduced energy production.
34) Fig 3. – at the top right, I suggest adding a comparative panel with a male
beneficial mutation to show that because males do not transmit mt genomes, both mt
genomes will reach the same level in the next generation regardless of their effects
on males.
Here, our main focus is to illustrate how detrimental mutations can reach high levels
in a given population, so we have decided to leave out the additional panel to keep
the figure as simple as possible. However, we have added a sentence in the main
text stating that males are dead-end for mtDNA transmission.
35) 3rd paragraph beginning with “The nuclear background can influence the
strength of purifying…” The entire point of this paragraph was unclear to me. It is
unclear what is meant by “levels of proteins” “nuclear isoforms” or “this would reduce
the need and strength of purifying selection”. There may be important points in this
paragraph, but it was largely confusing to me what the authors were trying to get
across.
We have made some changes to make it more explicit.
Heteroplasmy and mitochondrial replacement therapy
36) 1st paragraph – I think there are actually a handful of three-parent babies that are
now teenagers. These procedures were done illegally I believe and are not well-
documented, but I think the authors should look into this and make this sentence
reflect the history or MRT, although I’m sure it’s a bit murky. See this popular article:
https://slate.com/technology/2016/02/three-parent-babies-have-been-here-since-the-
late-90s.html
The three-parent babies the reviewers mentioned were generated by cytoplasmic
transfer, rather than nuclear transfer as described in our review. However, it is a very
relevant point to be included as these people are also heteroplasmic for their mtDNA,
probably with even higher level of maternal mtDNA. We have included a discussion
to include those cases in both 2nd and 3rd paragraphs.
37) Last paragraph – “If we can make sure that the…” the idea of selecting a donor
with an mt genome that will have a replication advantage is really interesting, but you
might want to reiterate here that mitonuclear interactions might want to also be
considered in selecting a donor. For example, an ideal donor would have a mt
genome that is compatible with the patient’s nuclear DNA and has a replication
advantage against its defective mtDNA.
We have added such a discussion.
38) One thing that isn’t clear in this last section is why does carryover occur at all? Is
this just because the laboratory techniques are imperfect and a bit of the patient’s
cytoplasm with some mitochondria is always taken by accident? Would there be a
way to eradicate the patient’s cytoplasm/mt genomes prior to adding the donor
cytoplasm?
Although we are not expert in nuclear transfer, we believe that the carryover is mainly
due to the imperfect lab techniques. Moreover, some mitochondrial populations might
be physically adjacent to the oocyte nucleus. It is therefore difficult to avoid maternal
mitochondria completely during the transfer even with the steadiest hands.

Comments to the Author(s)
Title:
A battle for transmission: the cooperative and selfish mitochondrial genome
Authors:
Anna Klucnika and Hansong Ma
Summary:
In this manuscript, Klucnika and Ma review selfish behavior of mitochondrial
genomes in bilaterian animals, with especial focus on human mitochondrial
dynamics. The review discusses a variety of related topics, including heteroplasmy,
selection, drift, and bottlenecking in the oocyte. Notably, the evidence described,
while thoroughly researched, is restricted to bilaterian animals. This choice has the
unintended effects of both limiting the topic to a relatively narrow section of
mitochondrial diversity, and trying to pigeonhole mitochondrial biology of nematodes
and insects onto humans.
Overall, I found the topic to be of broad interest to the readership of Open Biology,
and if it is recast and re-titled to focus more narrowly on heteroplasmy in bilaterians,
to be quite well done. I also think the manuscript could use more careful editing, as
there were sever language usages that I found odd and unclear. Personally, I find the
focus on MRT to be less interesting than the dynamics of heteroplasmy, but the
authors do provide a novel perspective on it. Assuming the authors can narrow the
scope of their review and address a couple other minor issues, I think this manuscript
would make for a nice contribution to Open Biology.
Major Concerns:
1. Framing of the manuscript. The manuscript in its current state is framed as a broad
look into mitochondrial biology; however, little if any of the references discuss
mitochondrial biology outside of mammals, nematodes, and insects. This choice to
ignore the vast majority of mitochondrial biology while trying to draw broad
conclusions is odd. Much of what the authors are trying to discuss has been
researched extensively in other taxa, especially plants, but no credit is given to the
work done in that field. For example, mitochondrial genomes often experience
rampant recombination, varying degrees of biparental inheritance exist in non-
bilaterian lineages, and mutation rate varies orders of magnitude across taxonomic
groups, even within metazoa. This, as one might imagine, has profound
consequences for mitochondrial biology, especially with respect to the presumed
mutational meltdown mitochondrial genomes are supposed to experience.
Accordingly, the authors need to either broaden their literature scope considerably or
restrict their observations to bilaterian animals. I have also included a couple citations
below whose inclusion would help improve the manuscript, even if the focus
becomes narrower.
We totally agree with the reviewer about ignoring the vast majority of mitochondrial
biology literatures, especially the plant work. We intended to just describe mtDNA
heteroplasmy dynamics in animals and used the word metazoa in the abstract, but
failed to make it clear for majority of the manuscript. We apologize for the mistake
and providing a misleading broad impression. Therefore, we have changed the title
to: A battle for transmission: the cooperative and selfish animal mitochondrial
genomes. We have also made changes throughout the manuscript to restrict our
discussions on bilaterian animals, and cited some of the papers recommended by the
reviewers at the right places.
2. Emphasis on purifying selection/genetic drift. The section describing the forces that
can affect mitochondrial genome evolution and selfish mitochondrial genome
proliferation was overly simplistic. While purifying selection can and does play a
major role in mitochondrial genome evolution, the authors neglect entirely the role of
positive selection in mitochondrial biology. A poignant example can be glimpsed in
mitochondria present in populations that have migrated to low-oxygen conditions
(e.g., high elevation) relative to their ancestors and/or close relatives. While the
mitochondrial genome is small and rates of recombination are low, beneficial
mutations can still experience positive selection, especially when mitochondria are
poorly adapted to local environmental conditions (i.e., when fitness effects of
mutations are large).
This is a very good point. We have rephrased the title of the purifying selection
section to: Selections for organismal fitness, so we can talk about both purifying and
positive selections. We have also devoted a paragraph in this section to discuss
positive selection.
While much of the manuscript was well done, I have a couple additional minor
comments that the authors might consider to improve their manuscript.
• Page 2, when describing the genetic content of mitochondrial genomes. Note that
this section applies exclusively to bilaterians. Mitochondrial genomes of non-
bilaterians can differ quite dramatically from those of the systems that are the focus
of the present study (e.g., SDH is commonly still mitochondrially encoded in many
plant lineages)
As mentioned earlier, we have restricted our discussion on bilaterian mtDNA and
have made this explicit in the revised manuscript. We have now also cited the 2015
Smith & Keeling PNAS review that summarises the diversity of mtDNA organization
and gene content.
• Similarly, the point about high mutation rates does not apply beyond bilaterians.
See Lavrov and Pett for a nice review on metazoan mitochondrial genome diversity.
We have rephrased “high mutation” to “constantly-occurring mutations”.
• First paragraph of page 3 – “so the genome is under the strong influence of genetic
drift”. I think a lot of mitochondrial researchers would object strongly to this, absent
some contextual justification. See Konrad et al. 2017 for a contradictory opinion.
There are numerous papers supporting the drift ideas (e.g. Wonnapiinij et al, 2008,
Am J Hum Genet; Brown et al, 2001 Am J Hum Genet; Jenuth et al, 1995 Nat
Genet). Therefore, we would like to point out the influence of genetic drift on
heteroplasmic dynamics. However, to ensure that we are inclusive of different ideas
in the field, we have changed the statement to “so the genome can be under the
strong influence of genetic drift”, and cited papers with contradictory opinions
including the Konrad et al. paper.
• There is a repeated use of the term “selections”. I believe it would be better to say
“types of selection”.
We agree with the reviewer, and have made the changes throughout the manuscript
when appropriate.
• Page 4 “The nuclear genome is thus interested in…”. This is another problematic
sentence formulation. The nuclear genome is not interested in anything. Nuclear
genomes that successfully coordinate mitochondrial
expression/replication/transmission have higher fitness than nuclear genomes that do
not.
We have deleted the sentence.
• Cite Holland et al. 2018 on page 4 somewhere.
We have added the reference.
• “Limited recombination has little power to remove de novo mutations”. I do not
believe this statement to be factually correct. See Neiman and Taylor 2009. Only a
little bit of recombination is necessary to reset Muller’s Ratchet.
We have rephrased the statement to “uniparental inheritance and little recombination
has limited power of removing de novo mutations”.
• I think the phrase “selfish selection” is odd. I would change to “Selfish proliferation”.
While selection can act at the level of the replicator (i.e., rapid/efficiently replicating
mtDNA molecules have a fitness advantage over slowly replicating mtDNA
molecules), I think the phrasing here sparks of some active role of the molecule in its
own selection. The term “proliferation” better encapsulates the phenomenon.
We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. However, phrases like “selfish proliferation”
imply that the nature of selfish transmission advantage is mainly due to replicative
advantage. There might be other mechanisms that lead to selfish behaviors that we
do not want to exclude. Furthermore, there are many examples where selfish
elements have evolved active mechanisms to increase their abundance by
interference or gonotaxis (summarised in Genes in Conflict book) (i.e. active role of
the DNA molecule in its own selection). For example, the killer X chromosomes can
increase in frequency by interfering with the replication of the alternative allele. Some
B chromosomes show preferential movement to the germline. We therefore argue
that the phrase selfish selection is appropriate, especially when describing evolution
in a gene-centric view. However, we have defined selfish selection when we first
mentioned it as “selection for selfish gains in transmission”.
• The lack of any information about cytoplasmic male sterility in plants seems a
glaring omission in the selfish element section. This is a major reason why I think the
manuscript needs to be re-framed/narrowed in scope.
We again apologise for not making it clear that our review focus on only bilaterian
mtDNA. We have made it clear in the revised version.
• Remove the reference to unpublished data from the top part of page 9. Given that it
is unpublished, the audience cannot properly evaluate the quality of the evidence
supporting the point. The resulting conclusion should therefore be removed until the
data can be properly viewed.
We agree and have removed the statement that is supported by unpublished data.
• The description of mitonuclear incompatibility and subsequent compensatory
coevolution is not correctly described. See Sloan et al. 2017 for a better description
of the dynamics at play.
We have taken on board the reviewer’s comments and have rephrased our
description. We hope that the description is now correct and that we have made the
focus on heteroplasmy more explicit.
• In the MRT section, I think it would be worth citing Havird et al 2016.
We have cited the paper.
