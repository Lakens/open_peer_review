Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In the present study, authors explore epigenetic mechanisms leading to chemo-resistance in
Gastric Cancer. Hence, they hypothesized if LncRNA HOXD-AS1 could be involved in resistance
of gastric cancer to cisplatin. To achieve their objectives, Yafei Ye and co-workers analyzed 42
tumor samples and their normal adjacent tissues. After obtaining tumor tissues, HOXD-AS1 was
over-expressed in tumor samples respecting to their normal counterparts and in gastric cancer
cell lines in comparison to normal GES-1 cells. A positive correlation between HOXD-AS1
expression level and poor survival of analyzed patients was demonstrated.
Then, HOXD-AS1 was knocked-down in gastric cancer cells. Suppression of HOXD-AS1
expression was associated with chemo-sensitivity. To further explore the role of HOXD-AS1 in
the regulation of chemo-resistance. It was analyzed whether HOXD-AS1 epigenetically inhibits
PDC4 by means of EZH2 recruitment to PDC4 promoter. Moreover, they showed an H3K27me3
occupancy mediated by HOXD-AS1.
Finally HOXD-AS1 knockdown overcame DDP resistance both in vitro and in vivo models. In
general terms the manuscript is well written and results are properly presented.the conclusions
are well argued and based on the results presented.
Major concerns
1. siRNAs employed showed a slightly inhibition of PDCD4 and EZH2. It is strongly
recommended when using siRNAs to knockdown a gene, to design at least 3, due to the
formation of secondary structures and binding to regulatory proteins
2. Figure 3B, authors state that HOXD-AS1 knockdown pointedly elevated PDCD4 expression in
BGC823/DDP cells. However, the result is completely different, there is a slight decrease in the
expression of PDCD4.

In this study, the authors investigated the role and mechanism of HOXD-AS1 in cisplatin
resistance of gastric cancer cells. The experimental design was clear and reasonable. However,
there are some minor issues which should be addressed.
1. The primer sequences of HOXD-AS1 and PDCD4 for qRT-PCR were not showed. What are the
the sequence of primers used in the qRT-PCR assay?
2. The vendor of MTT should be indicated.
3. How DDP-resistant and -sensitive gastric cancer tissue was defined is not mentioned.
4.What is the cut off of HOXD-AS1 “high” or “low” expression?
5. There is no table about the association of HOXD-AS1 expression with the clinical characteristics

Board Member's Comments to Author(s):
The manuscript needs major revisions in order to be considered for publication at the Open
Biology. A major weakness is use of a single siRNA construct to demonstrate function of HoxD-
AS1, at least one other siRNA should be added. Some minor comments include mistakes in text
and methodological clarifications as pointed out by the reviewers.

Re: Thank you for your comments. The primers for HOXD-AS1 and PDCD4 we used
came from the publishing papers. For HOXD-AS1, the primers were obtained from
the paper “HOXD-AS1 functions as an oncogenic ceRNA to promote NSCLC cell
progression by sequestering miR-147a”. (Wang Q, Jiang S, Song A, et al. HOXD-AS1
functions as an oncogenic ceRNA to promote NSCLC cell progression by
sequestering miR-147a[J]. OncoTargets and therapy, 2017, 10: 4753.) For PDCD4,
the primers were obtained from the papers “MicroRNA-182 modulates
chemosensitivity of human non-small cell lung cancer to cisplatin by targeting
PDCD4” and “miR-21 modulates chemosensitivity of tongue squamous cell
carcinoma cells to cisplatin by targeting PDCD4”. (Ning F, Wang F, Li M, et al.
