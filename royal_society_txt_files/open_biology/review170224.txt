The manuscript by Beer et al. uses immunostaining techniques to investigate the distribution of
the peptide PDF in the brain of the honeybee. In addition, the authors address the role of PDF as
a circadian signal in the honeybee brain by measuring daytime-dependent and circadian changes
in immunostaining intensity as well as the effects of PDF injection into the honeybee brain on
circadian locomotor activity. The morphological analysis of PDF-immunostained neurons and
their projections is of highest scientific standard, and although the distribution of PDF
immunostaining as well as colocalization with PER has been published before, the 3D
reconstructions of cells and fiber projections provide a level of detail that has not been achieved
so far. Daytime changes in staining intensity support a role of PDF as a circadian signal, but in
constant condition, circadian changes in the intensity of immunostaining are only maintained in
the medulla. PDF injections yielded mixed effects on circadian walking activity, depending on
experimental procedures. Although all lines of evidence taken together provide a solid case for
PDF in the circadian system of the bee, I have some concerns regarding interpretation of
immunostaining, as well as on the presentation of data and their discussion.
General comments
1. I do not see sufficient evidence supporting the existence of a novel area of PDF arborizations
termed anterior lobular hub (ALO). Is there really a novel neuropil (ALO) in the bee that is not
present in other insects? The accessory medulla (AME) in the bee might just be slightly detached
from the medulla in comparison to other insects and would then correspond to your ALO or at
least include it. I have a hard time recognizing a distinct neuropil labelled “AME?” in Figure 1
and 2. To me it rather looks like a loose fiber bundle leaving or entering the medulla at this point.
Assuming that the ALO (anterior lobular hub) is homologous to the AME of other insects would
be consistent with previous publications on PDF-staining in the honeybee and bumble bee
terming this area AME (your references 13 and 15). In larger flies, PDF neurons, likewise have
rather wide and diffuse ramifications anterior to the lobula that most likely correspond to the
more compact AME of hemimetabolous insects. Therefore I suggest changing these aspects of the
paper and omit the highly speculative supplementary discussion on that point.
2. The results and discussion puts too much weight on a possible effect of PDF in the mushroom
bodies and the central complex, although both neuropils, in contrast to many others are not
invaded by PDF-fibers. Instead important other possible targets, like neurosecretory cells that
have ramifications in superficial brain areas just like the PDF projections (Eichmüller et al. 1991, J
Comp Neurol 312:164) are not mentioned at all.
3. The results on PDF injections and circadian changes in staining intensity are overemphasized
and although the results are largely not significant (against control experiments, level variations),
the authors try to ignore this or discuss it away. This is reflected e.g. in section headings like
“PDF cycling continues under constant darkness” on line 760. This is true only in one brain area
and not in two others. Also “PDF injections phase shifted circadian rhythms in locomotor
activity” on line 770. This is true but saline injections also shift circadian rhythms and only in one
experiment with highest PDF concentrations was the effect significantly stronger that in control
experiments.

4. There is a long list of abbreviations accompanying the manuscript (line 39) but these are only
used in certain places of the text and not in others. I suggest reducing this list to a few key terms,
use these throughout the text and write out all the other terms.
Specific comments
Line 31, line 34: the statements are misleading and do not reflect the mixed results. Oscillation in
a circadian manner is shown only for one brain area and could not be verified for two others (line
31); a significant phase delay was only found with the highest concentration of PDF and only in
one type of experiment.
Line 39: It should be MCA – medial calyx, VL – vertical lobe of the mushroom body, MBU –
medial bulb
Page 4, line 8: .. of the sun across the sky…? Also line 10: …sun position in the sky…?
Line 65: it should be made clear that the anti PDF antiserum used here was obtained from
Dircksen
Line 98: it should be made clear here, that the anti-amPER antiserum used here is the one
characterized in reference 17
Line 169: should it be Fig. 8?
Line 211: …we fitted regression lines… How was this done? Did you use some mathematical
algorithms or was it eye fitting?
Line 215: How was the free-running period determined? Usually at least 10 days of free-running
rhythm are required for this but here the animals were studied only for four days
Line 215: what is deltaPower? How was it calculated?
Line 305: How many lateral neuron clusters were counted here?
Line 324: I believe that what you call the anterolobular PDF hub is in fact the accessory medulla
or a large part of it. This would be consistent with all other insects studied so far. The slight
detachment of this area from the medulla may just be a consequence of place constrains in the
tightly packed optic lobe and perhaps a different developmental time course of the AME owing
to lack of larval photoreceptors. I think this is the far more conservative interpretation of your
data and would be consistent with all previous studies on this and other species.
Line 331: I have a hard time seeing a neuropil here, it rather seems to be a complex of fibers
leaving or entering the medulla, and without additional evidence (other antisera, analysis at
higher resolution) I am not convinced that this small area is the AME (it may well be part of it).
Line 349: The majority…..does not leave..
Line 369: there is no Fig. 8b.
Line 384/385: interpretation, should go into the discussion.
Line 391: what you call “midbrain” was termed “central brain” by Ito et al. to avoid confusion
with the vertebrate midbrain.
Line 419: Why “Most interestingly….?
Line 426: “…in the middle of the protocerebrum…” This might correspond to the “cerebrum” of
Ito et al. Also on line 428, “medial brain”, would this correspond to “cerebrum”?
Line 504: …PDF fibres was again slightly….
Line 531, also Line 534: Fig. 10a?, resp. 10b?
Line 533 and Fig. 10b-d: It is not quite clear to me what the numbers inside the columns mean. In
the figure legend it says that this is the sample size, so the number of experiments. On Line 533
you say:”..and repeated each experiment three times…” Where do I see this in the figures? Please
clarify.
Fig. 10b: There are no numbers above the panel showing 0.01 mM PDF.
Line 539/540: “… and suggest that the influence of PDF is dose-dependent (this is however not
fully clear….”. This sounds as if you are not convinced by your suggestion yourself, and I am not
either. Is the time delay of 0.1 mM significantly different from the time delay of 0.001 mM?
Line 544: The strength of circadian rhythms (power) was lower…You statistically compare the
strength of the circadian rhythms here but do not provide their values. How were they calculated
and what information do they provide?
Line 555: “There was a strong effect to the estimated injection sites on the measured phase shift”.
I do not really see this. In d also the saline-induced phase shifts have higher values and they seem
4
to be much more dispersed and partly further away from the LN2 cells. If the determination of
your injection sites is indeed as accurate as suggested in the images in c and d, you should be able
investigate a possible correlation between injection site (distance) and resultant phase shift taking
each individual injection into account. You might then be able to plot distance vs. phase shift and
should see higher phase shifts at lower distances.
Line 565: Mushroom bodies and central complex are conspicuously not invaded by PDF
processes. Would one not expect PDF-fibers to massively invade these structures if PDF play a
role in memory and spatial orientation? Nevertheless, as you point out later, putative input and
output areas from the mushroom body and central complex are invaded.
Line 636: “We suggest that the bee ALO is not anatomically homologous to the AME of the
cockroach or fly.” You do not really provide evidence for that. Also see my general comment 1. I
suggest that the ALO is part of what has been termed AME in other insects, and in fact, a paper
by one of your coauthors (Bloch et al 2003) made a strong and quite convincing case for the dense
processes anterior to the lobula delineating the AME in the honeybee. What made you change
your mind here? You may well discuss in this paragraph the difference in appearance of PDF
processes in this area in the bee vs. other insects but I do not see sufficient evidence for a bee- or
Hymenopteran-specific brain area here.
Line 642-647: It is fine to point out the lack of larval photoreceptors in the bee as a possible reason
for the different appearance of the AME, but suggest omitting the more extensive discussion on
this in the supplement.
Line 662: medial lobes
Line 665: “it likely can reach into the mushroom bodies”. The mushroom bodies are
conspicuously free of PDF processes. I would expect PDF fibers to enter the mushroom bodies if
PDF would influence synaptic interactions within this structure. Perhaps it does not do that but
modulates the input (I do not see prominent staining in the antennal lobe) or output (is there
staining in the lateral horn?).
Line 703: You do not have to be so cautious here. The LAL is, as far as I can tell, correctly labeled
in Fig. 7d and seems to be well supplied by PDF processes.
Line 760: This heading is misleading, because it continues in a statistically significant way only in
the serpentine layer. Why not pose the heading more neutral like “PDF levels under constant
darkness” the same applies to the heading in Line 770 – effects significant from saline injections
were found only at the highest PDF concentrations.
Line 775: “PDF injection caused a dose-dependent phase-delay… This statement in the discussion
is much stronger than that in the results. Please se my comments on this regarding Line 539/540.
Line 799-801: “..excellently positioned… these include neuropils involved in sun-compass
orientation and time-associative learning” Again this should be phrased more cautiously!
Figure legend 5: What do the different colors of processes show?
Line 1260: “…on the entire surface of the protocerebrum…” No, the mushroom-body calyces and
vertical lobes are spared!
Line 1262: medial

A central element of neural circuits conveying circadian rhythmicity lies neurotransmission of the
intrinsic cycling molecular clock. In the fruit fly the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor
provides a central element of linking the internal cycling of clock genes within a defined subset of
clock neurons to behavioural activity. In the current study Beer and colleagues show that Pdf
appears provide a similar function in the honey bee Apis melilfera.
The experimental data provided are clear and of high quality. Similarly, the underlying logic of
the study is well prepressed both in figure and text.
While it is by itself not overly surprising that Pdf has a similar function in circadian rhythmicity
in dipterans and hymenopterans as expression of Pdf has been previously reported in several
Insect species. However, as the current study moves forward towards a functional impact of Pdf
in circadian behaviour I feel it provides a sufficient degree of novelty that would merit
publication in journal of broad interest such as Open Biology. This particularly in view that the
honey bee displays complex behavioural alterations in relationship to circadian rhythms as the
authors nicely highlight in the introduction and discussion.
I have only a few suggestions on the manuscript.
- While it may beyond the scope of the current study it may be relevant to address how the
application of Pdf acts in a broader sense, for instance on the cycling expression of clock genes (eg
Per). Moreover, ass the injection of synthetic Pdf is a quite invasive experimental procedure not
comparable to high precision genetic manipulations in the fruit fly it may be beneficial to down-
tone some sections of the manuscript.
- It is unclear if the accessory medulla is an independent structure. Here a neuropil label, such as
synapsin may be helpful. This would help the authors to omit the questionnaire in their figures
and clarify the presence of this structure. Alternatively, one might argue that the neuropil to with
Pdf neurites directly branch could be defined as AME.
- For figure 1 it may be beneficial to display the actual biological acquired information not only
the 3d model, there is only little information to be gained from current fig 1c.
- Figure 2 lacks labelling of individual panels, please correct.
Uppermost row: all images could be more zoomed on the actual cells (too much irrelevant black
information); also here showing the individual channels would be beneficial to show that indeed
6
all Pdf cells are Per positive.
2nd, 3rd and 4th row: it is unclear how different panels are different from each other and what
the information content is (also provide this information better in figure legend).
- Figure 3: row b and c unclear what the benefit of the different panels with different orientation
is. The display of the model is very clear and nice, however this seems repetitive.
- Also for figure 5 a/b the benefit of display is unclear.

Beer et al describe a detailed anatomical and functional analysis on PDF neurons in the honeybee.
While the neural mechanisms underlying circadian regulation of activity have been well studied
in the fruit fly, honey bees depend on the clock for more complex circadian associated behaviors
including time-compensated sun compass and time memory. Despite the importance of
circadian processes in these complex behaviors, little is known about the mechanisms underlying
these processes. PDF has the dual function as a clock output and coordinating activity within the
circadian circuit. The comprehensive description of PDF neurons in this manuscript will be
extremely useful for groups investigating circadian function in insects and the evolution of the
circadian clock. The manuscript provides a comprehensive description of PDF neuron anatomy.
A number of interesting findings are identified including PDF projections near PER-positive glial
cells. In addition, the authors provide strong evidence that, similar to Drosophila, PDF cycles in
7
accordance with circadian time and regulate circadian behavior in the honey bee. The manuscript
and materials and methods section are very well written. The images and reconstructions are
striking and on par with those commonly observed in the fruit fly. While I have a few minor
suggestions below, I believe this manuscript is scientifically sound in its current state.
1. The manuscript uses stocks from multiple different strains. While this is not appear to be a
confound, it may be worth commenting on this in the discussion. It would seem that the
robustness across strains is as meaningful as any potential differences observed.
2. It is not clear how the authors were able to differentiate between changes in PDF neuron
structure (as has been reported in Drosophila) and PDF neuropeptide.
3. Line 466: The experiments described do not necessarily test if PDF is rhythmically expressed.
The authors may want to rework this description. Changes in staining intensity may be due to
differences in release or neuropeptide levels (as is described in text).
4. Line 315: It’s stated there is a movie showing projections but the name of the file is not
referenced.
5. Figure 2: The accessory medulla is labeled ‘AME?.’ If there concern that this is not truly the
AME this should be stated more clearly in the legend. If the authors truly believe it is reminiscent
of the AME, why not label it AME?
6. It’s not clear what happens to PDF once it is injected into the brain. Is it similar to an ICV
injection in mammals or does it remain localized near the injection cite. Speculation would be
helpful as it is important for interpreting the results

for the different appearance of the AME, but suggest omitting the more extensive discussion on
this in the supplement.
Line 662: medial lobes
Line 665: “it likely can reach into the mushroom bodies”. The mushroom bodies are
conspicuously free of PDF processes. I would expect PDF fibers to enter the mushroom bodies if
PDF would influence synaptic interactions within this structure. Perhaps it does not do that but
modulates the input (I do not see prominent staining in the antennal lobe) or output (is there
staining in the lateral horn?).
Line 703: You do not have to be so cautious here. The LAL is, as far as I can tell, correctly labeled
in Fig. 7d and seems to be well supplied by PDF processes.
Line 760: This heading is misleading, because it continues in a statistically significant way only in
the serpentine layer. Why not pose the heading more neutral like “PDF levels under constant
darkness” the same applies to the heading in Line 770 – effects significant from saline injections
were found only at the highest PDF concentrations.
Line 775: “PDF injection caused a dose-dependent phase-delay… This statement in the discussion
is much stronger than that in the results. Please se my comments on this regarding Line 539/540.

Comments to the Author(s)
A central element of neural circuits conveying circadian rhythmicity lies neurotransmission of the
intrinsic cycling molecular clock. In the fruit fly the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor
provides a central element of linking the internal cycling of clock genes within a defined subset of
clock neurons to behavioural activity. In the current study Beer and colleagues show that Pdf
appears provide a similar function in the honey bee Apis melilfera.
The experimental data provided are clear and of high quality. Similarly, the underlying logic of
the study is well prepressed both in figure and text.
While it is by itself not overly surprising that Pdf has a similar function in circadian rhythmicity
in dipterans and hymenopterans as expression of Pdf has been previously reported in several
Insect species. However, as the current study moves forward towards a functional impact of Pdf
in circadian behaviour I feel it provides a sufficient degree of novelty that would merit
publication in journal of broad interest such as Open Biology. This particularly in view that the
honey bee displays complex behavioural alterations in relationship to circadian rhythms as the
authors nicely highlight in the introduction and discussion.

I have only a few suggestions on the manuscript.
- While it may beyond the scope of the current study it may be relevant to address how the
application of Pdf acts in a broader sense, for instance on the cycling expression of clock genes (eg
Per). Moreover, ass the injection of synthetic Pdf is a quite invasive experimental procedure not
comparable to high precision genetic manipulations in the fruit fly it may be beneficial to down-
tone some sections of the manuscript.
- It is unclear if the accessory medulla is an independent structure. Here a neuropil label, such as
synapsin may be helpful. This would help the authors to omit the questionnaire in their figures
and clarify the presence of this structure. Alternatively, one might argue that the neuropil to with
Pdf neurites directly branch could be defined as AME.
- For figure 1 it may be beneficial to display the actual biological acquired information not only
the 3d model, there is only little information to be gained from current fig 1c.
- Figure 2 lacks labelling of individual panels, please correct.
Uppermost row: all images could be more zoomed on the actual cells (too much irrelevant black
information); also here showing the individual channels would be beneficial to show that indeed
all Pdf cells are Per positive.
2nd, 3rd and 4th row: it is unclear how different panels are different from each other and what
the information content is (also provide this information better in figure legend).
- Figure 3: row b and c unclear what the benefit of the different panels with different orientation
is. The display of the model is very clear and nice, however this seems repetitive.
- Also for figure 5 a/b the benefit of display is unclear.

Comments to the Author(s)
Beer et al describe a detailed anatomical and functional analysis on PDF neurons in the honeybee.
While the neural mechanisms underlying circadian regulation of activity have been well studied
in the fruit fly, honey bees depend on the clock for more complex circadian associated behaviors
including time-compensated sun compass and time memory. Despite the importance of
circadian processes in these complex behaviors, little is known about the mechanisms underlying
these processes. PDF has the dual function as a clock output and coordinating activity within the
circadian circuit. The comprehensive description of PDF neurons in this manuscript will be
extremely useful for groups investigating circadian function in insects and the evolution of the
circadian clock. The manuscript provides a comprehensive description of PDF neuron anatomy.
A number of interesting findings are identified including PDF projections near PER-positive glial
cells. In addition, the authors provide strong evidence that, similar to Drosophila, PDF cycles in
accordance with circadian time and regulate circadian behavior in the honey bee. The manuscript
and materials and methods section are very well written. The images and reconstructions are
striking and on par with those commonly observed in the fruit fly. While I have a few minor
suggestions below, I believe this manuscript is scientifically sound in its current state.
1. The manuscript uses stocks from multiple different strains. While this is not appear to be a
confound, it may be worth commenting on this in the discussion. It would seem that the
robustness across strains is as meaningful as any potential differences observed.
2. It is not clear how the authors were able to differentiate between changes in PDF neuron
structure (as has been reported in Drosophila) and PDF neuropeptide.
3. Line 466: The experiments described do not necessarily test if PDF is rhythmically expressed.
The authors may want to rework this description. Changes in staining intensity may be due to
differences in release or neuropeptide levels (as is described in text).
13
4. Line 315: It’s stated there is a movie showing projections but the name of the file is not
referenced.
5. Figure 2: The accessory medulla is labeled ‘AME?.’ If there concern that this is not truly the
AME this should be stated more clearly in the legend. If the authors truly believe it is reminiscent
of the AME, why not label it AME?
6. It’s not clear what happens to PDF once it is injected into the brain. Is it similar to an ICV
injection in mammals or does it remain localized near the injection cite. Speculation would be
helpful as it is important for interpreting the results

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Beer et al. uses immunostaining techniques to investigate the distribution
of the peptide PDF in the brain of the honeybee. In addition, the authors address the role of
PDF as a circadian signal in the honeybee brain by measuring daytime-dependent and
circadian changes in immunostaining intensity as well as the effects of PDF injection into the
honeybee brain on circadian locomotor activity. The morphological analysis of PDF-
mmunostained neurons and their projections is of highest scientific standard, and although
he distribution of PDF immunostaining as well as colocalization with PER has been
published before, the 3D reconstructions of cells and fiber projections provide a level of detail
hat has not been achieved so far. Daytime changes in staining intensity support a role of
PDF as a circadian signal, but in constant condition, circadian changes in the intensity of
mmunostaining are only maintained in the medulla. PDF injections yielded mixed effects on
circadian walking activity, depending on experimental procedures. Although all lines of
evidence taken together provide a solid case for PDF in the circadian system of the bee, I
have some concerns regarding interpretation of immunostaining, as well as on the
presentation of data and their discussion.
General comments
1. I do not see sufficient evidence supporting the existence of a novel area of PDF
arborizations termed anterior lobular hub (ALO). Is there really a novel neuropil (ALO) in the
bee that is not present in other insects? The accessory medulla (AME) in the bee might just
be slightly detached from the medulla in comparison to other insects and would then
correspond to your ALO or at least include it. I have a hard time recognizing a distinct
neuropil labelled “AME?” in Figure 1 and 2. To me it rather looks like a loose fiber bundle
eaving or entering the medulla at this point. Assuming that the ALO (anterior lobular hub) is
homologous to the AME of other insects would be consistent with previous publications on
PDF-staining in the honeybee and bumble bee terming this area AME (your references 13
and 15). In larger flies, PDF neurons, likewise have rather wide and diffuse ramifications
anterior to the lobula that most likely correspond to the more compact AME of
hemimetabolous insects. Therefore I suggest changing these aspects of the paper and omit
he highly speculative supplementary discussion on that point.
This is indeed a hard call. We have removed the supplementary discussion from the
manuscript as the reviewer suggested. Furthermore, we removed all the correspondence
elating to the anterior lobular hub and only emphasized that the dense PDF network may
have moved from its “common place” in the AME to anteriorly of the lobula. We agree with
he reviewer that one can hardly recognize a distinct neuropil in the place in which the AME
can be expected to be located based on studies with other insects (and we wrote so in the
ext). This is why we added a question mark after the term AME in our original figure. We do
not think that there is an AME in this place, but instead the PDF relay center of the honey
bee is located anterior of the lobula. We believe that it is still unclear whether the honeybee
PDF relay center is homologous to the AME. To account for all these uncertainities we
emoved the labeling “AME” from the figure and only described the PDF network anterior of
he lobula without giving it a name and without discussing any putative homology with the
AME.
2. The results and discussion puts too much weight on a possible effect of PDF in the
mushroom bodies and the central complex, although both neuropils, in contrast to many
others are not invaded by PDF-fibers. Instead important other possible targets, like
neurosecretory cells that have ramifications in superficial brain areas just like the PDF
projections (Eichmüller et al. 1991, J Comp Neurol 312:164) are not mentioned at all.
The reviewer is right. We have only marginally mentioned that the PDF fibers may have other
putative targets like the neurosecretory cells in the brain. We have now corrected our failure
and added a new chapter (p 29-30) to the discussion that reads the following:
Connections between PDF neurons and brain centres that modulate the activity/sleep cycle
Neurosecretory cells in the superior protocerebrum, namely in the pars intercerebralis and
ateralis have been shown to modulate metabolism, sleep, activity and other behaviours in
nsects (Nässel, 2002). In the honey bee, the somata of the lateral neurosecretory cells are
distributed anterior to the peduncles of the lateral calyces, in a band that extends from the
median calyces to the ventro-lateral edge of the lateral calyces (Eichmüller et al., 1991). This
s exactly the area, where we found a very dense network of PDF fibres. Thus, it is most
ikely that the PDF neurons signal to lateral neurosecretory cells. A similar connection is
ikely between PDF fibres in the superior median protocerebrum and the neurosecretory cells
of the pars intercerebralis in the bee brain. In Drosophila melanogaster, several output
pathways from the PDF neurons to peptidergic cells in the pars lateralis and intercerebralis
have been shown: (1) The PDF neurons signal on diuretic hormone 31 (DH31) expressing
neurons in the superior protocerebrum that consecutively release DH31 waking up the flies in
he morning (Kunst et al., 2014). (2) In the same brain area, the PDF neurons signal to
Allatostatin C positive neurons that provoke the flies’ postprandial sleep (Chen et al., 2016).
3) Finally, the PDF positive neurons signal via dorsal clock neurons to diuretic hormone 44
DH44)-positive neurons in the pars intercerebralis (Cavanough et al., 2014) and from there
o hugin-expressing neurons in the subesophageal zone that run to motor circuits in the
horacic ganglia (King et al., 2017). DH44 is the homologue of the mammalian corticotropin-
elasing factor that is rhythmically released from the hypothalamus to prepare the organism
or action. Similarly, DH44 appears to prepare the flies for activity. Although these pathways
are not yet revealed in the honey bee, the PDF neurons appear suited to contact similar
neuropeptidergic circuits controlling activity and sleep in the honey bee brain.”
n addition, we mention now in the introduction that we are also interested to evaluate the
connections of the clock with brain centres that control activity and sleep not only those with
he brain centres responsible for memory and compass orientation. The sentence on page 4,
ines 57-58:
However, the neuroanatomical organization of the bee circadian network and its
connections with brain centres that control activity and sleep, memory and orientation, are
not well characterized.”
3. The results on PDF injections and circadian changes in staining intensity are
overemphasized and although the results are largely not significant (against control
experiments, level variations), the authors try to ignore this or discuss it away. This is
eflected e.g. in section headings like “PDF cycling continues under constant darkness” on
ine 760. This is true only in one brain area and not in two others. Also “PDF injections phase
shifted circadian rhythms in locomotor activity” on line 770. This is true but saline injections
also shift circadian rhythms and only in one experiment with highest PDF concentrations was
he effect significantly stronger that in control experiments.
We found consistent cycling in various brain areas and in four independent experiments
including a small preliminary experiment that is not included in the paper). However, the
eviewer is right that ANOVA failed to detect statistically significant time effect in two of three
brain areas in DD. Given that ANOVA is poor in detecting cyclic changes over a time series,
n the revised manuscript we also used a non-parametric test that was specifically developed
or cycling transcripts (JTK_CYCLE; Hughes et al., J Biol Rhythms 2010). A strength of this
analysis is that it is independent of the waveform of the rhythm. Given the superiority of this
method for circadian analyses, we have re-analyzed the PDF-staining results that yielded no
significant time dependence by ANOVA with the JTK-Cycle method. We found that PDF is
significantly cycling in all three investigated brain areas in DD. Therefore, we do not think that
we overemphasized our results on circadian changes in PDF staining intensity.
Regarding the results on PDF injections, we agree with the reviewer and accordingly tone
down relevant text in the Abstract, Results and the Discussion explicitly saying that there was
a consistent trend, but the effect was statistically significant in only a few experiments.
4. There is a long list of abbreviations accompanying the manuscript (line 39) but these are
only used in certain places of the text and not in others. I suggest reducing this list to a few
key terms, use these throughout the text and write out all the other terms.
We reduced the list considerably and did not anymore abbreviate the different brain areas in
he text. Abbreviations for brain areas are now only used in the figures and explained in the
igure legends.
Specific comments
Line 31, line 34: the statements are misleading and do not reflect the mixed results.
Oscillation in a circadian manner is shown only for one brain area and could not be verified
or two others (line 31); a significant phase delay was only found with the highest
concentration of PDF and only in one type of experiment.
Line 31: We have reanalyzed the PDF-staining results in DD with a method that is better
suited to detect an oscillation in a 24-hour lasting time series (see above) and found a
significant cycling in all three brain areas. For more details see our reply to critique #3 above.
Line 34: We tone down the text which currently reads: “PDF injection into the area between
optic lobes and the central brain at the end of the subjective day produced a consistent trend
of phase-delayed circadian rhythms in locomotor activity.”
Line 39: It should be MCA – medial calyx, VL – vertical lobe of the mushroom body, MBU –
medial bulb
These abbreviations are now removed from the list.
Page 4, line 8: .. of the sun across the sky…? Also line 10: …sun position in the sky…?
Line 65: it should be made clear that the anti PDF antiserum used here was obtained from
Dircksen
s corrected as suggested.
Line 98: it should be made clear here, that the anti-amPER antiserum used here is the one
characterized in reference 17.
We added the following statement: “PER was detected by an antibody raised against the
entire amPER molecule, characterized in [17] and provided as courtesy of Eva Winnebeck.”
Line 142-143)
Line 169: should it be Fig. 8?
Yes, indeed. This is now corrected.
Line 211: …we fitted regression lines… How was this done? Did you use some mathematical
algorithms or was it eye fitting?
We used the Clocklab software to add linear regression lines to the daily time of onset of
activity and we now explain this point on page 12 (lines 263-265).
Line 215: How was the free-running period determined? Usually at least 10 days of free-
unning rhythm are required for this but here the animals were studied only for four days.
As stated in the text we compared the phase during the 4 days before and the 6 days after
he day of injection. Longer periods of recording are not necessary because the phase was
ypically stable.
Line 215: what is deltaPower? How was it calculated?
Power is an index for the strength of circadian rthyms that is obtained from periodigram
analyses. Delta power means the difference in power before and after the injection (or
control) procedure. Period (i.e., the Free Running Period) and power were determined with
he aid of the Clocklab software. We have added the following description to page 12 (lines
263-267): “We also compared the days before and after injection in terms of: (1) the free-
unning period and (2) the strength of circadian rhythms ("Power"). These indices were
determined with the Clocklab software before and after the injections. Then, changes in
period (<U+0394>FRP) and power (<U+0394>Power) were calculated by subtracting the values before the
njections from those afterwards.”
Line 305: How many lateral neuron clusters were counted here?
The number of PDF clusters that we counted is now indicated in the text (Page 16, lines 357-
358).
Line 324: I believe that what you call the anterolobular PDF hub is in fact the accessory
medulla or a large part of it. This would be consistent with all other insects studied so far.
The slight detachment of this area from the medulla may just be a consequence of place
constrains in the tightly packed optic lobe and perhaps a different developmental time course
of the AME owing to lack of larval photoreceptors. I think this is the far more conservative
nterpretation of your data and would be consistent with all previous studies on this and other
species.
We changed this according to the reviewers suggestions (see also above and below).
Line 331: I have a hard time seeing a neuropil here, it rather seems to be a complex of fibers
eaving or entering the medulla, and without additional evidence (other antisera, analysis at
higher resolution) I am not convinced that this small area is the AME (it may well be part of
t).
We removed the term AME from the figure and the text and changed this paragraph into the
ollowing (page 17, lines 378-387):
On their way towards the central brain, all PDF neurons project into a high-density network
ocated in front of the lobula (red arrows in Figs. 2-4) and less intensively into an accessory
medulla that should be located at the base of the medulla. To localise the accessory medulla
n the bee brain, we used HRP and DAPI counterstaining which mark the neuronal
membrane and cell nuclei, respectively. With this approach, we identified an area at the base
of the medulla that was free of nuclei and innervated by PDF fibres (Fig. 2). The latter
continued into the serpentine layer of the medulla (arrowhead in Fig. 2; blue fibres in Figs. 4,
5) and to a minor degree into the most distal layer of the medulla and into the lamina (double
arrow head in Fig. 2; red fibres in Figs. 4, 5). Nevertheless, the innervation of this area by
PDF fibres was not very prominent, but of similar density as the innervation of the medulla.”
Line 349: The majority…..does not leave.

Line 369: there is no Fig. 8b.
The “b” is removed.
Line 384/385: interpretation, should go into the discussion.
This sentence is removed.
Line 391: what you call “midbrain” was termed “central brain” by Ito et al. to avoid confusion
with the vertebrate midbrain.
The term “midbrain” has been eliminated.
Line 419: Why “Most interestingly….?
s removed.
Line 426: “…in the middle of the protocerebrum…” This might correspond to the “cerebrum”
of Ito et al. Also on line 428, “medial brain”, would this correspond to “cerebrum”?
We decided not to introduce another term such as the “cerebrum”. Therefore, we left “in the
middle of the protocerebrum” and changed “medial brain” into “medial protocerebrum”.
Line 504: …PDF fibres was again slightly….

Line 531, also Line 534: Fig. 10a?, resp. 10b?

Line 533 and Fig. 10b-d: It is not quite clear to me what the numbers inside the columns
mean. In the figure legend it says that this is the sample size, so the number of experiments.
On Line 533 you say:”..and repeated each experiment three times…” Where do I see this in
he figures? Please clarify.
The numbers inside the bars are the sample size pooled across the three trials. Due to the
ack of space, we do not show the results of each trial separately. To account for possible
variation across trials, we analysed the results using a Two-way ANOVA with trial and
reatment as factors. We edited the text to make thsese points clearer to the reader.
Fig. 10b: There are no numbers above the panel showing 0.01 mM PDF.
We assume that the reviewer means to say that there are no letters above the bars. The
eason for this is that the difference between the three treatments was not statistically
significant. To account for this information the Fig. legend says “bars with different letters
within the same plot differ statistically”
Line 539/540: “… and suggest that the influence of PDF is dose-dependent (this is however
not fully clear….”. This sounds as if you are not convinced by your suggestion yourself, and I
am not either. Is the time delay of 0.1 mM significantly different from the time delay of 0.001
mM?
We deleted the suggestion that the effect was dose-dependent
Line 544: The strength of circadian rhythms (power) was lower…You statistically compare
he strength of the circadian rhythms here but do not provide their values. How were they
calculated and what information do they provide?
Our method is explained above in reply to questions referring to lines 211 and 215. Given the
anyway large size of this paper, and the fact the injected solutions did not affect the strength
or period of circadian rhythms, we decided not to include the raw data and analyses in the
manuscript. Along with the reviewer comment, we now added in the text “data not shown”
next to these analyses.
Line 555: “There was a strong effect to the estimated injection sites on the measured phase
shift”. I do not really see this. In d also the saline-induced phase shifts have higher values
and they seem to be much more dispersed and partly further away from the LN2 cells. If the
determination of your injection sites is indeed as accurate as suggested in the images in c
and d, you should be able investigate a possible correlation between injection site (distance)
and resultant phase shift taking each individual injection into account. You might then be able
o plot distance vs. phase shift and should see higher phase shifts at lower distances.
We edited the text along with the reviewer comments. Given that the location of the cells is
estimated indirectly based on a projection of PDF staining, this method is appropriate for
providing general qualitative estimations, but not for precisely measuring the distance
between the site of injection and the PDF cells.
Line 565: Mushroom bodies and central complex are conspicuously not invaded by PDF
processes. Would one not expect PDF-fibers to massively invade these structures if PDF
play a role in memory and spatial orientation? Nevertheless, as you point out later, putative
nput and output areas from the mushroom body and central complex are invaded.
PDF is released in a paracrine fashion. Therefore, the PDF fibres do not necessarily need to
un into the mushroom body neuropil to exert a modulatory influence on the Kenyon cells.
We showed that the mushroom bodies are conspicuously “wrapped” by PDF fibers. Thus,
PDF can potentially affect mushroom body dependent learning and memory in a time-
dependent manner. In Drosophila, we have recently shown, that time-memory depends on a
unctional clock (the presence of PER) (Chouhan et al., Curr Biol 2015). Furthermore, we
have unpublished results that it this time-memory in Drosophila does also depend on PDF.
Unfortunately, there are no such data available for honey bees, but it is likely that the
mechanisms are similar. Here, we only want to say that the PDF fibres are suited to mediate
he information of time to the mushroom bodies as well as to the central and lateral complex
of the honey bee. We still believe that this is adequate and we decided not to change what
we have written in the manuscript.
Line 636: “We suggest that the bee ALO is not anatomically homologous to the AME of the
cockroach or fly.” You do not really provide evidence for that. Also see my general comment
1. I suggest that the ALO is part of what has been termed AME in other insects, and in fact, a
paper by one of your coauthors (Bloch et al 2003) made a strong and quite convincing case
or the dense processes anterior to the lobula delineating the AME in the honeybee. What
made you change your mind here? You may well discuss in this paragraph the difference in
appearance of PDF processes in this area in the bee vs. other insects but I do not see
sufficient evidence for a bee- or Hymenopteran-specific brain area here.
We did as suggested (see above).
Line 642-647: It is fine to point out the lack of larval photoreceptors in the bee as a possible
eason for the different appearance of the AME, but suggest omitting the more extensive
discussion on this in the supplement.
We removed the supplementary discussion
Line 662: medial lobes
s corrected
Line 665: “it likely can reach into the mushroom bodies”. The mushroom bodies are
conspicuously free of PDF processes. I would expect PDF fibers to enter the mushroom
bodies if PDF would influence synaptic interactions within this structure. Perhaps it does not
do that but modulates the input (I do not see prominent staining in the antennal lobe) or
output (is there staining in the lateral horn?).
There is indeed only sparse staining in the antennal lobes. The lateral horn appears invaded,
but since we did not colabel the projections from the antennal lobes and could not
unequivocally see these by HRP staining, we do not want to discuss this possibility. In any
case, almost all parts of the protocerebrum could be influenced by PDF…
Line 703: You do not have to be so cautious here. The LAL is, as far as I can tell, correctly
abeled in Fig. 7d and seems to be well supplied by PDF processes.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestions and removed our overcaution.
Line 760: This heading is misleading, because it continues in a statistically significant way
only in the serpentine layer. Why not pose the heading more neutral like “PDF levels under
constant darkness” the same applies to the heading in Line 770 – effects significant from
saline injections were found only at the highest PDF concentrations.
See our statements above.
Line 775: “PDF injection caused a dose-dependent phase-delay… This statement in the
discussion is much stronger than that in the results. Please se my comments on this
egarding Line 539/540.
n line 775 we actually speak on saline, not PDF. We softened the wording to indicate that
here was a consistent trend rather than a strong effect. (Now: line 860)
Line 799-801: “..excellently positioned… these include neuropils involved in sun-compass
orientation and time-associative learning” Again this should be phrased more cautiously!
We changed this sentence to: “The extensive arborisations in the central brain are in a good
position to convey time-of-day information from the LN2 to brain centres involved in various
clock output functions.” (Now line 887-889)
Figure legend 5: What do the different colors of processes show?
The different colors indicate the fibers that invade the different neuropils. We have now
added the following description to the figure legend: “For better distinction, PDF fibres
nvading the LA are shown in red, those invading the ME in blue, those in the dense
arborisation area in front of the lobula (LO) in green, those in the lobula valley tract in white
and those in the posterior optic commissure (POC) in orange.”
Line 1260: “…on the entire surface of the protocerebrum…” No, the mushroom-body calyces
and vertical lobes are spared!
The description is changed into the following: “The PDF fibres form a network on the entire
surface of the protocerebrum (green fibres) without penetrating the mushroom bodies.” (Now:

Comments to the Author(s)
A central element of neural circuits conveying circadian rhythmicity lies neurotransmission of
he intrinsic cycling molecular clock. In the fruit fly the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing
Factor provides a central element of linking the internal cycling of clock genes within a
defined subset of clock neurons to behavioural activity. In the current study Beer and
colleagues show that Pdf appears provide a similar function in the honey bee Apis melilfera.
The experimental data provided are clear and of high quality. Similarly, the underlying logic
of the study is well prepressed both in figure and text.
While it is by itself not overly surprising that Pdf has a similar function in circadian rhythmicity
n dipterans and hymenopterans as expression of Pdf has been previously reported in
several Insect species. However, as the current study moves forward towards a functional
mpact of Pdf in circadian behaviour I feel it provides a sufficient degree of novelty that would
merit publication in journal of broad interest such as Open Biology. This particularly in view
hat the honey bee displays complex behavioural alterations in relationship to circadian
hythms as the authors nicely highlight in the introduction and discussion.
have only a few suggestions on the manuscript.
While it may beyond the scope of the current study it may be relevant to address how the
application of Pdf acts in a broader sense, for instance on the cycling expression of clock
genes (eg Per). Moreover, ass the injection of synthetic Pdf is a quite invasive experimental
procedure not comparable to high precision genetic manipulations in the fruit fly it may be
beneficial to down-tone some sections of the manuscript.
We agree that the suggested experiments are important, but they are indeed beyond the
scope of the current contribution. We also agree that we should down-tone the importance of
some aspects of our work and did so in several sections throughout the manuscript (see also
comments to Reviewer #1).
It is unclear if the accessory medulla is an independent structure. Here a neuropil label,
such as synapsin may be helpful. This would help the authors to omit the questionnaire in
heir figures and clarify the presence of this structure. Alternatively, one might argue that the
neuropil to with Pdf neurites directly branch could be defined as AME.
This point was also raised by Reviewer #1 and we have addressed it accordingly (see
comments to Reviewer #1).
For figure 1 it may be beneficial to display the actual biological acquired information not
only the 3d model, there is only little information to be gained from current fig 1c.
We agree that it is always beneficial to show original pictures. We have decided only to show
he details of the PDF staining and not to show an overview of the PDF staining in the brain,
because such an overview was already published by Sumiyoshi et al. (2011). A staining
overiew is also shown in our Fig. 8. Furthermore, the 3D model permits to highlight certain
ibers in different colors and to have a look at the brain from different angles. For example, it
would not be possible to look at the brain from the top as shown in Fig. 1c. Therefore, we do
not want to remove Fig. 1c.
Figure 2 lacks labelling of individual panels, please correct.
The panels are now labelled individually.
Uppermost row: all images could be more zoomed on the actual cells (too much irrelevant
black information); also here showing the individual channels would be beneficial to show
hat indeed all Pdf cells are Per positive.
2nd, 3rd and 4th row: it is unclear how different panels are different from each other and
what the information content is (also provide this information better in figure legend).
We modified the entire figure legend to express the information content more clearly.
The purpose of this figure was to show that only few PDF fibres innervate the region, in
which the AME should be located. The panels show a quadruple labeling (for PDF, PER,
HRP, DAPI) of the same area at 3 different brain depths (from left to right), respectively. Only
or HRP we show the single labeling (3rd row), the other rows show different combinations of
double-labelings. We cannot zoom on the actual cells in the uppermost row, because all
pictures have to remain at the same magnification. We have shown before that indeed all
PDF cells are PER positive (Fuchikawa et al., 2017). In Figure 2a this colocalisation is also
visible and we state now in the figure legend that all LN2 cells contain PDF and PER.
Figure 3: row b and c unclear what the benefit of the different panels with different
orientation is. The display of the model is very clear and nice, however this seems repetitive.
The benefit of the different orientation is that one can see the close vicinity of the PER-
positive nuclei to the PDF fibres. Furthermore, we feel that PDF arborizaiton pattern is rather
complex such that some repetition can facilitate understanding the 3D pattern.
Also for figure 5 a/b the benefit of display is unclear.
Figure 5 a, b is the only figure in which we show the PDF innervations of the lamina and the
spatial relationship between the PDF fibres in the medulla, the lobula valley tract and the
posterior optic commissure. We have now explained the use of the different colors in the
egend.

Comments to the Author(s)
Beer et al describe a detailed anatomical and functional analysis on PDF neurons in the
honeybee. While the neural mechanisms underlying circadian regulation of activity have
been well studied in the fruit fly, honey bees depend on the clock for more complex circadian
associated behaviors including time-compensated sun compass and time memory. Despite
he importance of circadian processes in these complex behaviors, little is known about the
mechanisms underlying these processes. PDF has the dual function as a clock output and
coordinating activity within the circadian circuit. The comprehensive description of PDF
neurons in this manuscript will be extremely useful for groups investigating circadian function
n insects and the evolution of the circadian clock. The manuscript provides a
comprehensive description of PDF neuron anatomy. A number of interesting findings are
dentified including PDF projections near PER-positive glial cells. In addition, the authors
provide strong evidence that, similar to Drosophila, PDF cycles in accordance with circadian
ime and regulate circadian behavior in the honey bee. The manuscript and materials and
methods section are very well written. The images and reconstructions are striking and on
par with those commonly observed in the fruit fly. While I have a few minor suggestions
below, I believe this manuscript is scientifically sound in its current state.
1. The manuscript uses stocks from multiple different strains. While this is not appear to be a
confound, it may be worth commenting on this in the discussion. It would seem that the
obustness across strains is as meaningful as any potential differences observed.
This is indeed an important point. Following the reviewer’s suggestions we added the
ollowing sentence to the paragraph opening the Discussion (page 26):
Importantly, most of our findings were confirmed for bees from different colonies (which are
genetically different) and even for stocks in different countries, adding to the generality and
obustness of our findings.”
2. It is not clear how the authors were able to differentiate between changes in PDF neuron
structure (as has been reported in Drosophila) and PDF neuropeptide.
The reviewer raises an important point that is difficult to address in the honey bee. In contrast
o Drosophila, the PDF fibres in the honey bee brain are very dense and present at all time
points. We could not see any changes in PDF neuron structure. This does not mean that
hese do not existent, but that we felt unable to measure these on our preparations. We have
now added a supplementary figure (Fig. S7) that shows the PDF fibers between the calyces
and the vertical lobe (area 2 as depicted in Fig. 8) at the times of minimal and maximal PDF
staining intensity. In this picture, one cannot detect any obvious changes in the structure of
he PDF fibres. Thus, the quantification of staining intensity may mainly reflect changes in the
amount of PDF. Also in the other brain areas, the PDF fibres are similarly dense.
Furthermore, in contrast to Drosophila, it is not possible to see the entire terminals of a
subgroup of the PDF neurons in a defined stack of confocal stacks. Therefore, we cannot
perform the same analysis that was performed in Drosophila.
We added the following sentences to page 22 (last sentence in 2.3.): “Changes in staining
ntensity may be due to peptide release or differences in levels in the cell. In addition,
changes in neuron structure are possible (Fernandez et al., 2008). We were not able to
detect such structural changes in our preparations (Fig. S7). Thus, the changes we report
below appear mainly due to different PDF levels.”
3. Line 466: The experiments described do not necessarily test if PDF is rhythmically
expressed. The authors may want to rework this description. Changes in staining intensity
may be due to differences in release or neuropeptide levels (as is described in text).
We added the sentence ““Changes in staining intensity may be due to peptide release or
differences in levels in the cell.”
4. Line 315: It’s stated there is a movie showing projections but the name of the file is not
eferenced.
We added the name of the file to the results (Page 16, line 368) and to data accessibility
page 36). We also provide some information on the software with which the file can be
opened on page 36: “A movie showing a 360° view of the 3-D PDF network reconstruction in
he honey bee brain is available as supplementary material (AVI-file named “Movie PDF-
network (2)”; after download it is to be opened with for example Fijj-ImageJ or VLC media
player software) at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.999523.”
5. Figure 2: The accessory medulla is labeled ‘AME?.’ If there concern that this is not truly
he AME this should be stated more clearly in the legend. If the authors truly believe it is
eminiscent of the AME, why not label it AME?
As mentioned in response to the other reviewers, we have removed “AME” from our labeling.
6. It’s not clear what happens to PDF once it is injected into the brain. Is it similar to an ICV
njection in mammals or does it remain localized near the injection cite. Speculation would
be helpful as it is important for interpreting the results
This is a good point. We asked a colleaque who is experienced in injecting peptides. She
said that dyes injected into the optic lobe diffuse in the extracellular matrix of almost the
entire optic lobe. Nevertheless, a peptide as PDF will be immediately cleaved by
endopeptidases that are present in the extracellular matrix in order to terminate neuropeptide
signaling. Therefore, it is very likely, that PDF diffusion is less far than the diffusion of a dye.
Nevertheless, we have no proof for this. Given that our paper is already rather long, we
prefere not to add further speculation. However, if you feel that we should add a sentence we
are most willing to do so.
