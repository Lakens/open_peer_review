Le Shu and coworkers present the manuscript “Signature miRNAs in peripheral blood
monocytes of patients with gastric or breast cancers”. This study is very preliminary and the
research it’s very descriptive. Functional data are needed to fully support the conclusions and
elevate the quality of paper. The bioinformatics analysis of miRNAs is very poor and should be
sustainably improved. In addition, authors over interpret several data, which obligate to
demonstrate its statements. Also, validation of data in a large cohort is missing. Before potential
publication in Open Biology some important concerns should be fully addressed.
Introduction section:
Authors should better explains the previous works, specifically when they claims “At present,
monocytes are known to play a major role in tumor progression [18-20]”. ????. No
explanation or summarizing data of these reports is provided in introduction.
Table 1 and Figure 2. Authors identify monocytes miRNAs from a total of 15 breast cancer
patients, 12 gastric cancer patients and 13 healthy donors by RNA sequencing. However, is
mandatory to validate its data in a validation large cohort of patient’s vs controls.
Table 2. Potential novel miRNAs should be moved to Supplementary data.
Authors claim that a total of 38 novel mature miRNAs were revealed. These miRNAs were
compared to those identified in other RNA sequencing projects from gastric and breast reports, or
how they reach this conclusion?.
Table 3. The differentially expressed miRNAs in monocytes from healthy donors
and cancer patients. These data are already included in the heat map, thus Table 3 should be
changed. Please describe here only the miRNAs modulated in breast against gastric cancer
including fold change, cromosomal location, validated or predicted, previous reports, etc, in the
same Table.
Table 4. The predicted target genes of cancer-associated miRNAs. This Table should be removed
as it’s very incomplete. For each miRNA we expected at least 1000 targets and authors just picked
one to five targets… why ?? .
Table 5. The categories of genes targeted by miRNAs. Again, this table is very incomplete.
Fig 1. The first nucleotide bias of putative novel miRNAs from healthy donors

(A), breast cancer patients (B) and gastric cancer patients (C). These data is already depicted in
table thus it should be removed.
Fi g 2. Authors identify 120 miRNAs modulated…. And they conclude that were associated with
cancers. How these miRNAs from monocytes may contributes to carcinogenesis ?. Experimental
data to support these conclusions should be added.
Authors claims “The results showed that the expression patterns of the 11 selected miRNAs were
consistent with the data of miRNA sequencing (Fig 2B)”. However no comparison was done in
this figure, in addition some changes in miRNAs expression are non-significant as SD overlaps
between control and cancers.
Fig 3. The expression patterns of target genes in monocytes of cancer patients
and healthy donors. Some RT-PCR expression data seem to be no significant, as SD overlaps
between controls and cancer samples. For example, miR-7706 (gastric vs healthy), miR-342-5p
(Control vs gastric), miR-130a-3p (control vs breast), etc.
Fig 4. Pathways mediated by cancer-associated miRNAs. (B) Pathways mediated by miR-146b-3p
and miR-553 4433a-3p in cancers. Again why only two targets?. HIF-1 signaling pathways is more
related to hypoxia and angiogenesis, please correct data.
Functional data is lacking in this study. Expression profiling is not sufficient for a miRNAs paper.
I encourage authors to show the contribution of one miRNA modulated in the carcinogenesis
using in vitro approaches.
Finally, English grammar should be corrected in all the text.

The authors performed a miRNA profiling in monocytes of gastric and breast cancer patients. The
results could be very interesting due to the emerging role of immunotherapy.
The cohort is small and I don't understand because breast and gastric cancers are studied
together.

2. Fig 1B. Again, the differences between individual miRNAs expression in gastric, breast against

statistics expert.
3. Fig 2. Influence of miR-150-5p in THP-1 monocytes on tumorigenesis. Some important controls
are lacking in the vtarget validation experiments.
i) A non-transfected control is lacking in RT-PCR assays (Fig. 1A and B). ii) a luciferase assay to
validate the binding of miR-150 to Notch3 and CCR2 genes inlcuding 3´UTR mutant controls.
Validation of miR-150 expression (as in Figure 1B) is required.
If miR-150 binds and downregulate Notch3 and CCR2 in monocytes, is not sufficient to claim its

Dear editor,
I am pleased to know that our manuscript, entitled “Signature miRNAs
in peripheral blood monocytes of patients with gastric or breast
cancers” (RSOB-18-0051) has the opportunity to be reconsidered for
publication in Open Biology. I would like to take this opportunity to
appreciate your effects and to thank the anonymous reviewers for their
valuable suggestions and comments. The manuscript has been
subjected to revision accordingly. All changes made are highlighted
with red color in the revised manuscript. The details are listed below.
For Reviewer 1:
1) Question: Introduction section:
Authors should better explains the previous works, specifically when
they claims “At present, monocytes are known to play a
major role in tumor progression [18-20]”. ????. No explanation
or summarizing data of these reports is provided in introduction.
Answer: It is a good suggestion. The Introduction has been revised as
suggested.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: lines 109-125.
2) Question: Table 1 and Figure 2. Authors identify monocytes
miRNAs from a total of 15 breast cancer patients, 12 gastric cancer
patients and 13 healthy donors by RNA sequencing. However, is
mandatory to validate its data in a validation large cohort of patient’s
vs controls.
Answer: We agree the reviewer’s comment. Based on a published
paper (Li S et al., Deep sequencing reveals small RNA
characterization of invasive micropapillary carcinomas of the breast.
Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2012. 136: 77-87), 5 patients with cancer are
used for the small RNA sequencing. In our study, more than 10
samples are used. The text is modified according to the comment.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: lines 376-377.
3) Question: Table 2. Potential novel miRNAs should be moved to
Supplementary data. Authors claim that a total of 38 novel mature
miRNAs were revealed. These miRNAs were compared to those
identified in other RNA sequencing projects from gastric and breast
reports, or how they reach this conclusion?
Answer: Regarding Table 2 in the original manuscript (Table 3 in the
revised manuscript), the novel miRNAs are obtained by searching the
identified human miRNAs in the database (www.mirbase.org). The
information is provided in the revised Table 3.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Table 3.
4) Question: Table 3. The differentially expressed miRNAs in
monocytes from healthy donors and cancer patients. These data are
already included in the heat map, thus Table 3 should be changed.
Please describe here only the miRNAs modulated in breast against
gastric cancer including fold change, cromosomal location, validated
or predicted, previous reports, etc, in the same Table.
Answer: It’s a good suggestion. Table 3 in the original manuscript
(Table 4 in the revised manuscript) has been changed as suggested.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Table 4.
5) Question: Table 4. The predicted target genes of cancer-associated
miRNAs. This Table should be removed as it’s very incomplete. For
each miRNA we expected at least 1000 targets and authors just picked
one to five targets… why ?? .
Answer: As suggested, Table 4 (in the original manuscript) is deleted
in the revised manuscript.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Line 267; Table 4.
6) Question: Table 5. The categories of genes targeted by miRNAs.
Again, this table is very incomplete.
Answer: As suggested , Table 5 (in the original manuscript) is
removed.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Line 275; line 279; Table 5.
7) Question: Fig 1. The first nucleotide bias of putative novel
miRNAs from healthy donors (A), breast cancer patients (B) and
gastric cancer patients (C). These data is already depicted in table thus
it should be removed.
Answer: Fig 1 (in the original manuscript) is removed in the revised
manuscript.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Line 246; Fig 1.
8) Question: Fig 2. Authors identify 120 miRNAs modulated…. And
they conclude that were associated with cancers. How these miRNAs
from monocytes may contributes to carcinogenesis? Experimental data
to support these conclusions should be added.
Authors claims “The results showed that the expression patterns of the
11 selected miRNAs were consistent with the data of miRNA
sequencing (Fig 2B)”. However no comparison was done in this figure,
in addition some changes in miRNAs expression are non-significant as
SD overlaps between control and cancers.
Answer: As suggested, miR-150-5p is characterized to evaluate
whether the miRNAs from monocytes may contribute to
carcinogenesis. The data are provided in Fig 2 of the revised
manuscript. Some quantitative real-time PCR assays are re-conducted.
The data are provided in Fig 1B of the revised manuscript.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Lines 58-60; lines 195-197;
lines 217-228; lines 285-306; Fig 1B; Fig 2 and its legend.
9) Question: Fig 3. The expression patterns of target genes in
monocytes of cancer patients and healthy donors. Some RT-PCR
expression data seem to be no significant, as SD overlaps between
controls and cancer samples. For example, miR-7706 (gastric vs
healthy), miR-342-5p (Control vs gastric), miR-130a-3p (control vs
breast), etc.
Answer: According the comment, some quantitative real-time PCR
assays are re-conducted. The data are provided in Fig 1B of the revised
manuscript.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Fig 1B.
10) Question: Fig 4. Pathways mediated by cancer-associated
miRNAs. (B) Pathways mediated by miR-146b-3p and miR-553
4433a-3p in cancers. Again why only two targets? HIF-1 signaling
pathways is more related to hypoxia and angiogenesis, please correct
data.
Answer: As suggested, Fig 4B is modified.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Fig 3B.
11) Question: English grammar should be corrected in all the text.
Answer: The English writing of the manuscript is edited by an English
speaker.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: the whole manuscript.
For Reviewer 2:
1) Question: The cohort is small and I don't understand because breast
and gastric cancers are studied together.
Answer: Based on a published paper (Li S et al., Deep sequencing
reveals small RNA characterization of invasive micropapillary
carcinomas of the breast. Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2012. 136: 77-87),
5 patients with cancer are used for the small RNA sequencing. In our
study, more than 10 samples are used. The text is modified according
to the comment. Regarding the study on breast and gastric cancers, the
two cancers are investigated in our study to get the common signature
miRNAs from different cancers.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: lines 129-130; lines 376-377.
2) Question: description of the healthy controls and a table describing
the cohort of breast and gastric cancer.
Answer: As suggested, the sample information is provided in Table 1
of the revised manuscript.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: line 136; line 139; Table 1.
3) Question: deep descrption of bioinformatic analyses.
Answer: Bioinformatic analysis is described in detail as suggested.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: lines 178-183.
4) Question: statistical analyses description is completely absent.
Answer: Statistical analysis is described in the revised manuscript.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: lines 229-233.
5) Question: Tables have to report p-values.
Answer: As suggested, p value is added in Table 4 of the revised
manuscript.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Table 4.
I think that the revision would meet the reviewers’ comments and
suggestions and that our manuscript now is acceptable for publication.
In the case of any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Thank you very much!

1) Question: Its clear that the manuscript was not corrected by an
native English speaker. Manuscript still contains a lot of grammar
errors. Please use a commercial service for manuscript grammar
correction and editing and provide the corresponding certificate.
Answer: As suggested, we have submitted our manuscript to Nature
publish group for language revision (invoice no SNCPV6LGL).
Revisions in the revised manuscript: the whole manuscript.
2) Question: Fig 1B. Again, the differences between individual
miRNAs expression in gastric, breast against controls are not clear. SD
are overlapping between groups. Its intriguingly how authors make
conslusions form these data, thus is strongly recommended the
analysis of these results by an statistics expert.
Answer: Fig 1B: The experiments of quantitative real-time PCR are
re-conducted to characterize the expression patterns of miR-194-5P,
miR-125B-5P, miR-324-5P and miR-574-3P.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Fig 1B.
3) Question: Fig 2. Influence of miR-150-5p in THP-1 monocytes on
tumorigenesis. Some important controls are lacking in the vtarget
validation experiments.
i) A non-transfected control is lacking in RT-PCR assays (Fig. 1A and
B). ii) a luciferase assay to validate the binding of miR-150 to Notch3
and CCR2 genes inlcuding 3´UTR mutant controls. Validation of
miR-150 expression (as in Figure 1B) is required.
If miR-150 binds and downregulate Notch3 and CCR2 in monocytes,
is not sufficient to claim its role in tumorigenesis. Please avoid
overinterpretation and remove these statements in all manuscript.
Answer: Fig 2. Influence of miR-150-5p in THP-1 monocytes on
tumorigenesis:
i) As suggested, non-transfected cells were included in the quantitative
real-time PCR analysis. The data are provided in the revised Fig 2A
and Fig 2C.
ii) Dual-luciferase reporter assays are conducted to explore the
interaction between miR-150-5p and Notch3. The supplementary data
are provided in the revised Fig 2B. Notch3 is the target gene of
miR-150-5p. CCR2 belongs to the Notch 3 pathway, but is not the
target gene of miR-150-5p.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: lines 227-236; line 290; lines
296-297; lines 299-306; lines 311-312; Fig 2A, Fig 2B, Fig 2C and
their legends.
4) Question: Table 3. Why authors named the miRNAs as "novel" if
the sequences were compared with previously sequences from public
databases ?...
The miRNAs are "novel" or "candidates".... For this reviewer this
nomenclature is not clear nor adequeate. Please provide an official
name (including genomic location) for these miRNAs.
Answer: The predicted novel miRNAs sequences were evaluated by
being compared with the previously sequences from miRbase database.
As suggested, genomic locations and names of the novel miRNAs are
provided in the revised Table 3.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Table 3.
5) Question: Finally, bioinformatic analysis is still very poor. No
supplementary data for an exhaustive bionformatic analysis of targets,
pathways have been provided.
Answer: As suggested, supplementary experiments are conducted.
The data are analyzed in the revised manuscript.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Fig 1B; Fig 2A, B and C.
For Reviewer 2:
Question: I invite the authors to improve Table 4 because it is not so
clear to which comparisons they refer with the reported p-val
Answer: As suggested, p value of Table 4 is explained.
Revisions in the revised manuscript: Table 4.
I think that the revision would meet the reviewers’ comments and
suggestions and that our manuscript now is acceptable for publication.
In the case of any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Thank you very much!
