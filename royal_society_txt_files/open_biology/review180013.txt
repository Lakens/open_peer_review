Manuscript RSOB-18-0013 is an excellent and timely commentary on the fast-evolving field of
epigenome editing to identify causal epigenetic variants in health and disease.
I only a few minor suggestions:
1. Probably caused by an conversion error into pdf, the first sentence needs correcting from
1013 individual cells to 10e13 individual cells.
2. Two statements on page 2 referring to 411 cells types and page 3 referring to global
chromatin changes resulting in little transcriptomic changes, respectively, are based on pre single
cell analysis. It would be helpful to comment if current single-cell data support or deviate from
these findings.
3. The finding that the majority of GWAS hits map to non-coding and frequently enhancer
elements has enabled targeted functional analyses that have been able to pinpoint causal variants.
It would be informative to comment where the thousands of EWAS hits map to (obviously taking
genome coverage into account where appropriate) and if they identify particular elements for
functional analysis, including epigenome editing.

label_comment_2
This is a well written, reasonable work that will provide the novice with a conceptual background
for understanding new approaches to assessing epigenetic phenotypes. I have minor
suggestions:
1. The issue of tissue specificity is raised but is not stressed. This is a critically under-appreciated
issue in this field and should be stressed.
2. I would urge the authors to comment upon the possibility that negative studies of the sort they
advocate are 'false' negative. For example, the genetic background in any individual may
influence the phenotype. Many of the traits that are subject to EWAS are multi-genic and this
candidate specific approach may fail to properly interrogate the complex nature of associations.
The first sentence needs a superscript for 1013.

Decision letter (RSOB-18-0013)
26-Feb-2018
Dear Dr Stricker,
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0013 entitled "Entering the post-
epigenomic age - back to epigenetics" has been accepted by the Editor for publication in Open
Biology. The reviewer(s) have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor revisions
to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments and revise
your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
4
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
5
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
The Open Biology Team
