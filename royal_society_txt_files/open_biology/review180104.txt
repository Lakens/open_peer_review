The review by George et al. summarizes several established methods used to track RNAs in live
or fixed cells and discusses the pros and cons of each approach. The latter information is nicely
summarized in Table 1. The manuscript is concise and well-written, with clear and visually
effective figures summarizing each method. The article provides a helpful guide for choosing the
appropriate RNA tracking approach to address the investigator’s question at hand and should be
a useful resource for both experienced RNA biologists as well as those new to the field.
I would offer a few suggestions for improving the article:
1. It might be helpful to some readers to include additional examples in the Introduction that
illustrate how RNA localization is used for biological regulation. Some possibilities might include
the pioneering work of Singer and colleagues on ß-actin mRNA compartmentalization, and
more recent studies showing how mRNA localization can affect protein function. Citing a few
relevant review articles would also be helpful.
2. The authors might add a section describing “cutting edge” RNA localization technologies. i)
There are several new methods reported that simultaneously track mRNA location and
translation of the encoded protein. ii) Church and colleagues have described an in situ
sequencing procedure that can detect at least abundant RNAs within cells. iii) There is also a
published method that uses combinatorial in situ hybridization of labeled oligonucleotides
(multiplexed FISH) to track the locations of multiple RNAs in fixed cells. Readers may find it
useful to learn about these advanced methods for future consideration.
3. The authors could mention the advantages of using FISH probes that can distinguish mRNAs
from different species. For example, when mapping RNA localization signals by deletion
mutagenesis, RNAs from one species (e.g., mouse) can be introduced into cells from a distinct
species (e.g., human) and the exogenous RNAs tracked without interfering signals from the
endogenous WT RNA. In this case the endogenous RNA also does not necessarily need to be
depleted, which can be advantageous when ablation of the gene is deleterious to cells.
4. Minor point: The first sentence of the last paragraph on p. 6 has a grammatical error. The
words “Due to the fact that the” can be deleted to correct the sentence.

This review article by George et al, discusses the main RNA tracking techniques that are routinely
used in fixed cells and tissues as well as in live cells. As stated by the authors, the technical
development allowing the labeling and tracking of transcripts inside the cell opened the door to
better understand the relationship between RNA localization, its expression and degradation. In
addition RNA tracking techniques helped our understanding of the relationship between RNA
misslocalization and several pathologies.
One of the main challenges that still remain to this day is being able to follow the movement of
endogenous RNA in a way that its labeling and/or association with exogenous trans-acting factor
such as probes and RNA binding proteins does interfere with its normal movement. The authors
nicely describe the main techniques used in the field such as RNA Fish, RNA beacon, MS2
Tagging and Cas-derived methods.
The review is well written and and it is easy to follow for a non-expert in the field. I like the fact
that each technique is described in a simple but accurate way and in many instance advantages
and examples were provided. The Figures illustrating each technique are clear and help better
appreciate and understand the method described.
While each technique is well described, specific examples illustrating the advantages and the
challenges of each method are missing. What are the criterea to chose one technique over
another? Can all these technique be used on all cell lines and tissues? Such examples will help
better appreciate the challenges of techniques such as the MS2 tagging and the Cas-derived
method.
On the other hand, the RNAscope approach is not common and in my opinion can either be
expanded more or simply removed. In fact the authors themselves recognize that the use of this
technique is mainly limited to tissues.
Overall this a well-ritten review that gives an update on the latest development in the RNA
tracking methodologies. It will be helpful to both experts and non-expert.

Dear Editor:
We appreciate your encouraging feedback and the insightful comments from the referees who
evaluated our manuscript, RSOB-18-0104.
In order to respond to the reviewers’ points in full, we have revised Sections 3.1., 3.2., 3.3., 4.1., and 6.1.
These revisions include more applied examples of the described techniques applied in research. We have
also added a new section: “6.3. Fluorescent in Situ RNA Sequencing.” This section describes FISSEQ, a
method of sequencing RNA done entirely in situ.
Thanks to the reviewers’ constructive feedback, we feel that our revised manuscript is considerably
stronger and more complete. We hope that this manuscript will help readers determine which method of
RNA tracking is appropriate for their research needs. Given the escalating interest in understanding the
role of RNA trafficking in diverse cellular processes, we believe that this report will appeal to your
diverse readership. Thank you for considering it.
Sincerely,

Appendix B
Response to the Comments from Reviewer 1:
1. It might be helpful to some readers to include additional examples in the
Introduction that illustrate how RNA localization is used for biological regulation.
Some possibilities might include the pioneering work of Singer and colleagues on ß-
actin mRNA compartmentalization, and more recent studies showing how mRNA
localization can affect protein function. Citing a few relevant review articles would also
be helpful.
[Authors’ Response] We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To highlight on
important discoveries made using these techniques, we have added several new
examples and citations. In the RNA FISH section, we discuss earlier work analyzing ß-
actin (ACTB) mRNA localization and its role in motility in fibroblasts (Kislaukis et al.,
1991) and neurons (Yao et al., 2006). We also added a more recent example in which
Yasuda and colleagues use MS2 to track RNAs to adenomatous polyposis coli-
containing ribonucleoprotein (APC-RNP) complexes to mutant FUS granules (Yasuda
et al., 2013). This research is relevant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as mutant FUS
proteins contribute to ALS aggregates (Sama et al., 2013).
2. The authors might add a section describing “cutting edge” RNA localization
technologies. i) There are several new methods reported that simultaneously track
mRNA location and translation of the encoded protein. ii) Church and colleagues have
described an in situ sequencing procedure that can detect at least abundant RNAs
within cells. iii) There is also a published method that uses combinatorial in situ
hybridization of labeled oligonucleotides (multiplexed FISH) to track the locations of
multiple RNAs in fixed cells. Readers may find it useful to learn about these advanced
methods for future consideration.
[Authors’ Response] We thank the reviewer for these recommendations. Regarding
recommendation i), we have revised section 4.1 to describe the use of MS2-RNA
tracking in conjunction with a fluorescent Fab fragment to tag nascent polypeptides in
order to image single-transcript translation in vivo (Morisaki et al., 2016). We have
addressed point ii) by adding a section (now section 6.3) on fluorescent in situ
sequencing (FISSEQ; Lee et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015) in the “Additional
Considerations” section. We describe the methodology behind FISSEQ, its application
in fixed cells and formalin-fixed tissue, and weigh the strengths and weaknesses of this
approach. We mention that the authors’ maximum transcript detection reached 8,102
genes, which is far more than any other method described here, and that this approach
may be better than FISH when one is looking for SNPs or splice variants. Finally, we
have addressed point iii) by expanding our description of multiplexed FISH and the
primary research that led to the development of this technique (Kosman et al., 2004).
We also mention that this approach is possible with molecular beacons and cite an
article that simultaneously used two molecular beacons to detect RNAs in live
Drosophila oocytes (Bratu et al., 2003). We also point out several research articles
mentioned in the introduction that involved FISH assays (Dreux et al., 2012; Woerner et
al., 2016).
3. The authors could mention the advantages of using FISH probes that can distinguish
mRNAs from different species. For example, when mapping RNA localization signals by
deletion mutagenesis, RNAs from one species (e.g., mouse) can be introduced into cells
from a distinct species (e.g., human) and the exogenous RNAs tracked without
interfering signals from the endogenous WT RNA. In this case the endogenous RNA
also does not necessarily need to be depleted, which can be advantageous when
ablation of the gene is deleterious to cells.
[Authors’ Response] We appreciate this suggestion made by the reviewer. While this
comment makes sense from a biological perspective, we were unable to find any
research articles that make use of this technique. Also, given that such an approach
would require the delivery of foreign nucleic acids in addition to the standard FISH
probes, it may be easier to use one of the other methods here to track such RNAs, such
as introduction of the foreign (here, mouse) RNAs with MS2 tags. These RNAs would
inherently differ from host RNAs, allowing easy distinctions to be drawn from host and
exogenous RNAs.
4. Minor point: The first sentence of the last paragraph on p. 6 has a grammatical
error. The words “Due to the fact that the” can be deleted to correct the sentence.
[Authors’ Response] We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error. “Due to the fact
that the…” has been deleted.
Response to the Comments from Reviewer 2:
1. While each technique is well described, specific examples illustrating the advantages
and the challenges of each method are missing. What are the criteria to choose one
technique over another? Can all these techniques be used on all cell lines and tissues?
Such examples will help better appreciate the challenges of techniques such as the MS2
tagging and the Cas-derived method.
[Authors’ Response] We thank the reviewer for these comments and have made several
changes accordingly. In section 6.1, “Further strengths and limitations,” we have added
more points on the benefits and weaknesses of each technique. Specifically, we have
specified which organisms and models are suitable for each method. We added the
caveat that RNAscope is explicitly made for paraffin-embedded tissue samples (Wang
et al., 2012). We have also provided more information on the weaknesses of the
bacteriophage-derived methods: difficulty of transfection, optimization, and model
limits. We also mention that samples may be fixed following assay execution for static
imaging as opposed to live-cell imaging. Other additions were made to the Cas
paragraph of this section. We discuss how the Cas systems have similar weaknesses to
the MS2-like systems, but have the benefit of improved signal:noise ratio without
optimization (Abudayyeh et al., 2017; Strutt et al., 2018).
2. On the other hand, the RNAscope approach is not common and, in my opinion, can
either be expanded more or simply removed. In fact the authors themselves recognize
that the use of this technique is mainly limited to tissues.
[Authors’ Response] We appreciate the reviewer’s input on the RNAscope section, and
have expanded this text (section 3.3). One of the biggest benefits of RNAscope is the
robust fluorescent emission provided by a single probe pair; for example, one set of
probes contains up to 400 dyes (Wang et al., 2012). While FISH fluorescence can be
amplified by increasing the number of tiling oligomers (Femino et al., 1998), this
extensive labeling may not always be possible if the transcript is short. If one were to
visualize a microRNA, a circular RNA at the splice junction, or a short 80-nucleotide
transcript, tiling may not be an option. As, RNAscope may be the only option for
detection. We have further expanded on the limitations of RNAscope for paraffinzed
tissue in section 6.1, “Further strengths and weaknesses.” We point out that this method
has been implemented in a clinical setting more often than in primary research (Wang et
al., 2012).
