Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The authors have produced an interesting review on cell tropism, however, the data provided are
rather skewed towards trypanosomes and include much less detail on Plasmodium spp. This
may disappoint some readers who might have expected a greater breadth of information from a
review entitled “Tissue Tropism in Parasitic Diseases”, although the title itself is accurate.
My expertise is in malaria biology and so my comments below reflect this:
1. The statement on line 30 that “Plasmodium falciparum infects exclusively humans” is not
entirely correct (see PLoS NTD (2018) 6(12): e0006801, in which Pf has been detected in non-
human primates), although the vast majority of infections are in humans.
2. The authors say that Plasmodium is the main driver of evolution in humans – how can they
justify this statement? In what context? There are many influences on the evolution of humans,
and it would seem to be a bold statement to say that Plasmodium is the largest of them all.
3. On line 103 it says that placental malaria “interferes with the normal nutrient exchange” this
leading to pathology. This is part of the syndrome but, as described later in the review, other
features (e.g. inflammation) are also important.
4. The findings that parasite populations can vary metabolically based on their tissue location
(lines 186-193) are very interesting but some care needs to be taken to extrapolate this work to
variation in other tissues and with time. How large an impact on drug treatment is this likely to
have and are there any data with current drugs to support this important aspect of the
observations?
5. Figure 3A (referred to on line 350) is a bit simplistic, and the comparison with Fig 3B highlights
the imbalance between the information provided for trypanosomes and that for Plasmodium.
The malaria figure could usefully have a bit more detail about the interactions and several
examples are available in the literature.
6. What does the sentence “Equally, non-human primate … to a large extent” (lines 352-354)
mean? It seems to suggest that because the protein transport machinery in the parasite and the
host receptors on the host are conserved, primate and rodent models of sequestration are
representative of P. falciparum sequestration, which is not the case. Models are very useful, but
their role in sequestration is debateable.
7. What are the data supporting the statement on line 365 that “Plasmodium sequestration in the
bone marrow vasculature increases permeability throughout infection”? The excellent paper by
De Niz et al does show vascular leakage associated with injection of gametocytes into a rodent
model of malaria, but these findings are not translated well by the sentence above.
8. Is chronicity restricted to only some species of Plasmodium (line 438)? Latency certainly is, but
chronicity would seem to be a broad attribute of Plasmodium spp.
9. The degree of sequestration varies widely in Plasmodium species, both in terms of the level
and duration. P. falciparum uses sequestration to avoid the spleen (line 483) but other human
3
malaria species seem to be able to pass through the spleen without being cleared. How does this
influence the argument used in this paragraph?
10. Why might antibody responses not be as effective due to different VSGs being expressed in
different body compartments (line 498)?
11. The authors say that findings in rodent models that show differential drug clearance in the
circulation compared to erythropoietic organs “are significant” for clinical treatment in humans.
Are there data to support this from clinical PK/PD studies for current drugs? Most clinical
studies on treatment for malaria have excellent cure rates.
12. Malaria parasites do not reach the CNS (line 527).
13. The effects of platelet reduction and activation of the clotting cascade (line 550) seem similar
to the histone-mediated damage seen in sepsis and trauma.
14. Studies now suggest that binding of VAR2CSA in placental malaria is exclusively to CSA, and
that earlier findings of a role for hyaluronic acid (line 558) were probably due to contamination of
CSA samples. In the line below (559), the phrase “which is preferential to binding of other
receptors elsewhere” is not clear. It might be easier to say that placental isolates tend to bind
better in the placenta and not in other vascular beds – there is a good immunological reason for
this, but it is probably not needed for this paper.
15. ARDS is rare in malaria (line 569) so to say in the line about that this is a complication of
infection by Plasmodium, including P. falciparum, is a bit misleading. ARDS is almost never seen
in children, and the acute respiratory distress syndrome is probably more to do with brain
swelling and acidosis in pediatric disease than lung damage. Thus, the data described in this
paragraph from mice do represent a response to parasite infection, but may not fully replicate the
situation in humans. Along similar lines, renal dysfunction (line 593) is seen quite commonly in
adults with severe malaria but is rarely seen in children with similar parasite and lactate levels.
16. What does the comment (line 651) “relevance of trophozoite and/or schizont sequestration
sites for merozoite fate” mean? Why are merozoites important in this context?
Minor corrections:
a. Line 78 – delete “naïve”
b. Line 84 – delete “most”
c. Line 180 – gambiense in italics
d. Line 187 – adaptation to adapt
e. Line 226 – remove question mark
f. Line 396 – change is to in
g. Line 509 - …especially to those that are hydrophilic
h. Line 545 – short to shortly
i. Line 584 – develops to develop, and suffers to suffer
In summary, this is an interesting and useful review of how parasites (mainly trypanosomes)
target particular cell types during their complex lifecycles. It would have been useful to have
more defined conclusions as to why this area is important and its potential impact of clinical
treatment, rather than the future perspectives largely being a call for more research.

Appendix A
Following the referees’ comments and after consulting with the editorial board, we have decided to
focus our review on tissue tropism of trypanosome infections. Therefore, much of the information on
Plasmodium infections were removed and smaller examples of tropism specificities of other parasites
have been included. As a result, comments #1-4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 16 from Referee 1, and specific points
on introduction and in tissue tropism in parasite life cycles from Referee 2 no longer apply and were
removed from list below.
Referee 1
The authors have produced an interesting review on cell tropism, however, the data provided are
rather skewed towards trypanosomes and include much less detail on Plasmodium spp. This may
disappoint some readers who might have expected a greater breadth of information from a review
entitled “Tissue Tropism in Parasitic Diseases”, although the title itself is accurate. My expertise is in
malaria biology and so my comments below reflect this:
5. Figure 3A (referred to on line 350) is a bit simplistic, and the comparison with Fig 3B highlights the
imbalance between the information provided for trypanosomes and that for Plasmodium. The malaria
figure could usefully have a bit more detail about the interactions and several examples are available in
the literature.
We have modified Fig. 3B to include examples of receptors for PfEMP1.
7. What are the data supporting the statement on line 365 that “Plasmodium sequestration in the bone
marrow vasculature increases permeability throughout infection”? The excellent paper by De Niz et al
does show vascular leakage associated with injection of gametocytes into a rodent model of malaria,
but these findings are not translated well by the sentence above.
We have rephrased ll. 355-358:
“Furthermore, it is the current view that Plasmodium infection results in altered vascular permeability
of various organs. For instance, in the bone marrow, increased vascular leakage is one of the
contributing factors for parasite entry to the extravascular spaces[109]. “
8. Is chronicity restricted to only some species of Plasmodium (line 438)? Latency certainly is, but
chronicity would seem to be a broad attribute of Plasmodium spp. .
In this situation, we want to describe latency. We have rephrased ll. 440-448 :
“Another interesting example of how tissue tropism can be exploited by parasites to maximize infection
potential is the latency phenomenon employed by some Plasmodium species. In humans, latency is
largely caused by P. vivax and P. ovale, and occurs in the liver, in stages called hypnozoites. The
relapses caused by hypnozoites display a high periodicity, with the relapse intervals being short and
frequent in tropical regions, and more temporally spread in temperate regions with obligate winters
[127,128]. Various hypotheses exist on the potential benefit of the dormancy mechanism and
corresponding relapses, including it being advantageous during intra-host competition with other
Plasmodium species and that they could allow simultaneous feeding of different Plasmodium strains to
mosquito vectors, contributing to generate high genetic diversity even in areas of low seasonal
transmission (reviewed in [129]). “
10. Why might antibody responses not be as effective due to different VSGs being expressed in
different body compartments (line 498)?
We do not know whether this is the case. We have expanded this section to make it clearer and provide
some speculation. Please see below (ll. 492-504):
“VSGs are highly immunogenic proteins that provoke an extensive antibody response by the host. This
potent and systemic antibody response is thought to be directed against the predominant VSG expressed by
bloodstream parasites. The existence of a very small proportion of parasites expressing minor VSG variants
results in the characteristic ‘waves of parasitaemia’, and thus the recurrent nature of the disease. However,
trypanosome populations from different niches in the same animal may not express the same VSG. This is
supported by very weak anti-serum cross-reaction between populations of different body compartments of
both T. vivax and T. brucei gambiense [57,139,140]. If parasites in different tissues expressed different
VSGs, the systemic antibody response might not effective. Thus, the potential VSG heterogeneity in
different body compartments could contribute to suboptimal antibody-based immunity and accelerate host
immune exhaustion. Furthermore, if these parasites were in sufficient numbers (like they are in the adipose
tissue of T. brucei-infected rodents) and in non-immune privileged sites, they themselves might trigger a
different antibody response, which would compete in lymphoid organ resources, thus potentially also
precipitating immune exhaustion.”
11. The authors say that findings in rodent models that show differential drug clearance in the
circulation compared to erythropoietic organs “are significant” for clinical treatment in humans. Are
there data to support this from clinical PK/PD studies for current drugs? Most clinical studies on
treatment for malaria have excellent cure rates.
Yes. We have added the relevant references and explained further (ll. 534-541):
“Similarly, work on rodent models of malaria have shown that while drug treatment with some anti-
malarials efficiently clears peripheral ongoing erythrocytic stage infections, it fails to clear parasites in
erythropoietic organs [150]. The implications of these observations for Plasmodium transmission,
therapeutics, and cure assessment are significant. In humans, the interplay between hematopoietic
organs, and parasite clearance upon antimalarial drug treatment has been recognized as an altogether
key field (reviewed in [151]). Moreover, transmission-stage survival in erythropoietic niches, even in
view of anti-malarial drug treatment, has been reported in several autopsy case studies in humans [152–
155].”
13. The effects of platelet reduction and activation of the clotting cascade (line 550) seem similar to
the histone-mediated damage seen in sepsis and trauma.
Thank you for the comment. We have included this hypothesis (ll. 585-588): “Alternative explanations,
albeit non-exclusive, include the negative effects of decreased platelet counts in vascular permeability
and clotting cascade [157]; histone-mediated damage, as observed in sepsis (reviewed in [158]); and
the damage induced by trypanosomes crossing the vascular endothelium to colonize tissues and
extravascular spaces [68].”
14. Studies now suggest that binding of VAR2CSA in placental malaria is exclusively to CSA, and
that earlier findings of a role for hyaluronic acid (line 558) were probably due to contamination of CSA
samples. In the line below (559), the phrase “which is preferential to binding of other receptors
elsewhere” is not clear. It might be easier to say that placental isolates tend to bind better in the placenta
and not in other vascular beds – there is a good immunological reason for this, but it is probably not
needed for this paper.
We agree that this sentence should be improved. During the revision process, we removed the ‘placental
malaria’ section, but we have still included a reference to the preferential biding of placental isolated
via VAR2CSA-CSA interaction. Additionally, we have removed the reference to hyaluronic acid.
Description of placental malaria can be found in ll. 506-519.
“Links between antigenic surface proteins and tissue tropism have been reported in other parasites. For
example, the P. falciparum PfEMP1 ligand, encoded by the antigenically-variable var genes, has
domains with different avidities to the endothelial cells of different tissues. For example, sequestration
to the placenta is mediated by binding of the VAR2CSA protein to the chondroitin-sulfate A (CSA) in
the placental endothelium [141]. Accumulation in the placenta is thought to be one of the ways the
parasite uses to circumvent host immunity, with up to 90% of parasite stages localizing to the placental
intervillous space, and not in other organs [142]. Parasites that specifically bind to VAR2CSA fail to
cause pathology if injected into men or children, despite antibodies against these variants being present
in these hosts [143] . Surface antigens of infected erythrocytes are immunologically distinct from other
variant surface antigens, and are main targets of IgG mediating protective immunity. Interestingly, the
CSA specificity is such that peripheral parasitemia is often resolved within a few days of delivery in
women living in areas of intense P. falciparum transmission [144]. Altogether, antibody recognition of
placental infected erythrocytes is highly dependent on the level of immunity, the time of pregnancy,
and the level of malaria prevalence in different settings.”
Minor corrections (except a. and b. that no longer apply) have all been completed.
In summary, this is an interesting and useful review of how parasites (mainly trypanosomes) target
particular cell types during their complex lifecycles. It would have been useful to have more defined
conclusions as to why this area is important and its potential impact of clinical treatment, rather
than the future perspectives largely being a call for more research.
We have modified and expanded the future perspectives section with the view to highlight the
importance of studying tissue tropism for tackling clinical treatment, transmission, and disease
progression.

General points
<U+F0B7> I feel this review is very interesting, timely and important. However, to make it more
accessible to a wider audience, the authors might consider adding a section about tissue tropism outside
of Plasmodium and trypanosomes? This could either be mentioned in the introduction or included as a
section in the main text. Also, in the introduction the authors could highlight the burden of disease
caused by Plasmodium and trypanosome parasites, just to reinforce why these are important organisms
to study.
We have added the burden of disease to the introduction (ll. 47-53): “These organisms are clinically
relevant as the causes of Chagas disease, sleeping sickness, nagana, and surra [3]. Chagas disease
currently affects 5 to 18 million people in the Americas, directly causing 10,000 deaths annually [4].
The prevalence of sleeping sickness (T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense) is declining fast
to less than 20,000 cases due to continued surveillance and control strategies, but 65 million people
remain at risk in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa [5]. Nagana and surra (T. congolense, T. vivax, T.
evansi) are a major and growing threat for livestock welfare and production in Africa, Asia, and Latin
America [5,6]. “
<U+F0B7> A summary in the introduction of the di<U+FB00>erent types of tropism in Plasmodium and
trypanosomes, and their mechanisms (e.g. receptors being expressed, speci<U+FB01>city of di<U+FB00>erent parts of the
life cycle) could perhaps link things together a bit more and set up the main text better. The authors
could even start with a section at the beginning of the main text outlining all the places parasites can
hide and infect, and then follow that order into the following sections (to outline the structure the review,
making it easier to follow).
We have highlighted structure of review in the final sentence of the introduction (ll. 57-62):
“We will provide an overview of i) how tissue tropism features in the life cycles of trypanosomes; ii)
the various tissue reservoirs of each species; iii) the known and potential mechanisms of tissue tropism;
iv) its advantages for the parasite; and v) how tropism influences organ-specific pathology. At the end,
we reflect on future perspectives for Trypanosoma tissue tropism research and on the potential impact
that research in this area can have for clinical treatment and transmission control strategy design.”
<U+F0B7> In the main text is it possible to draw comparisons and di<U+FB00>erences between the
trypanosome species rather than talk about each separately? Just so it’s easier to get the take home
messages. Or perhaps split the sections, inside of by parasite species, by commonalities and di<U+FB00>erences.
In our opinion, splitting based on species provides the clearest way to present the information because
the differences between parasites are very large and, more importantly, the depth of knowledge for each
parasite is extremely different. However, we agree that the take home messages should be more clearly
set. Therefore, we have improved the text, included concluding paragraphs at the end of each section to
reflect this need (e.g. ll. 289-308), and added a second table (Table 2) that shows the state-of-the-art in
the study of tropism in parasitic diseases.
<U+F0B7> Thoroughly researched, great list of references, however in some places a more in-depth discussion
of ideas and interpretation of the biology would be bene<U+FB01>cial. You mention brie<U+FB02>y in the introduction
about how tropism might be advantageous, but it would be good to keep relating it back to parasite
within-host development and between-host transmission (as this is the ultimate goal) in the rest of the
review.
We have taken this into account it the revision of the manuscript.
<U+F0B7> While coevolution is important, I feel the stronger angle to this paper is how tropism
contributes to disease pathology and how/if it helps parasites to survive/transmit to new hosts (for
example whether tropism is ‘deliberate’ or accidental). The authors outline evolution and selection in
the introduction, but really the review is about the mechanisms and di<U+FB00>erent types of tropism. I think
the mention of evolution and selection could be cut from the introduction and the focus be more on the
pathology and outcome of disease (as well as successful parasite transmission). Of course, the authors
could decide to mention it in the conclusion as a single sentence about host- parasite coevolution.
We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and made the changes accordingly.
<U+F0B7> Just check the use of adaptation. If a measured trait has adaptive signi<U+FB01>cance (or is an
adaptive trait), then it needs to be demonstrated that expression of said trait a<U+FB00>ects <U+FB01>tness (see
Dobzhansky 1956 ‘What is an adaptive trait?’). It’s obvious that it is bad for parasites if they are cleared
by the spleen, and good if parasites can hide in the liver and relapse at a later date, but maybe just point
out (either when you mention it in the main text, or in the discussion) that this hasn’t always been shown
to a<U+FB00>ect parasite <U+FB01>tness (i.e. transmission to future hosts). For example, on lines 187 and 629 authors
could instead say that ‘parasites may sense their environment and respond by upregulating...’, as adapt
means di<U+FB00>erent things in di<U+FB00>erent <U+FB01>elds.
We are grateful for this correction. We have changed this particular sentence to what the reviewer
suggests. We have also changed every other instance of “adaptation” and/or “adapt” to less contentious
terms.
Specific Points
3. Tissue reservoirs of parasites
Ref 11 needs completing.
We have done this.
Para starting line 128, just to check the take home: there are non-specific lesions in all areas of the brain
which may lead to neurological symptoms?
Line 187, typo: sense and adapt
We have corrected this.
Line 203, is it possible to discuss why parasites become parallel to the mononuclear cells? Is this
advantageous?
Line 303, perhaps leave the disease burden information in the introduction?
We have removed it and discussed the burden of disease in the introduction as requested in an earlier
comment.
5. Advantages of tissue tropism for the parasite
Line 418, is there a parasitaemia estimate?
Yes: “up to 108 parasites per milliliter of blood in experimental rodent models and 107 in livestock”
Line 418, could the authors clarify what a 'steady phase' means
It means continuous, non-oscillating, we have replaced “steady” with “continuous” (l. 413).
Line 426, just need to clarify if anaemia returns to normal during chronic infection.
It does not. We have added this information (l. 421).
Line 428, do parasites get cleared to the lymph nodes? Just trying to join the dots with
immune response and parasite clearance.
This is a good point, but unfortunately there is no information regarding parasite load in the lymph
nodes over time so we cannot say.
Line 445, check the use of evolutionary adaptation. Maybe just call it potential benefit? But I like the
speculation, do more of this.
We have replaced the term.
Line 456, how do trypanosomes in skin contribute to infection? I.e. More flies get infected?
Yes, we mention in the first sentence of the section that “Residing in the skin, for example, could allow
parasites to expand transmission sites and consequently expedite delivery to the next host [9,136]” (ll.
451-452). Yet, we have added a line to the end of the paragraph to reinforce this link (ll. 457-459): “If
more parasites are accessible in the skin, the probability of them being ingested by flies increases.
Therefore, skin tropism independent of bloodstream proliferation is advantageous for the parasite,
maximizing transmission potential of a single host.”
Line 475, are there no immune cells in extravascular spaces? What about tissue resident cells?
There are immune cells in extravascular spaces, but we do not know the extent of such immunity,
whether the efficiency level depends on the tissue, and what impact it has on the parasite. We have
added this information to clarify this point (ll. 475-478): “The peculiarities of the parasite-specific
immune response and the compositional differences of tissue-resident immune cells mean that
particular tissues might be less efficient in clearing infection. Therefore, we could hypothesize that
some extravascular spaces might be a better environment for parasite survival than the blood.”
6. Tissue tropism and organ specific pathology
Para starting line 607 (host circadian disorder), I'd be intrigued to expand more on this topic, how
parasites might do this and why? I think if you're trying to make the point that certain tropisms etc are
not just accidental, you need some chat about what they might achieve.
We did not wish to say that the host circadian disorder is not accidental as we do not have information
to support that statement. We have expanded this section and clarified it as follows (ll. 616-629):
“When T. brucei parasites invade the brain, they cause a sleep disorder rendering altered sleep/wake
cycles. The underlying causes of this disorder were shown for the first time in infected mice, which
showed not only alterations in their circadian sleep but also altered temperate regulation and feeding
patterns. Infection resulted in advanced circadian rhythms exhibiting atypical activity during the resting
phase. This behavioral pattern was shown to be due to a shortening in their circadian activity period
and induced specifically by the presence of T. brucei that might interact directly or indirectly, via
secreted molecules, with the host cells [169]. Upon parasite clearance, the sleep/wake cycle returns to
normal, which, coupled with the observation that terminal sleeping sickness patients do not show neuro-
degeneration [108,170], indicate that is the presence of T. brucei parasites and not the effect on the
neuronal tissue that causes the circadian disturbance characteristic of sleeping sickness [169]. How this
disorder may benefit the parasite and/or host remain a mystery. However, it is known that T. brucei
parasite modulate their gene expression according to the time of the day, which has consequences in
their resistance to external challenges. For example, sensitivity to oxidative stress and to drugs (e.g.
suramin) is different throughout the day [171], which may be an important factor when designing drug
treatment plans.”
