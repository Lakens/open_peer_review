Campbell and Tait have submitted an excellent overview of the BCL-2 protein family with a focus
on function and pharmacologic targeting. The review is well-written, benefits both expert and
novice and is well-balanced. However, the authors may want to consider the following few
points:
1) The authors describe the BCL-2 protein interplay as a rheostat. Although the rheostat model
was used to describe BCL-2 protein interactions, it had been falsified by the absence of stable
BCL-2 protein complexes. Along these lines the authors suggest that BCL-2 protein levels would
be important to understand the status of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling when recent
publications emphasize the importance of localization and conformation rather than level.
According to this research a small BAX pool localized to the mitochondria may result in an
increased apoptosis predisposition while a larger cytosolic pool may not.
2) The authors cite refs. 54 and 55 for the same discovery, but the results shown by these two
papers, although both obtained by super-resolution microscopy, are actually quite different. Ref.
54 introduces arcs and lines but lacks a third dimension, perhaps showing rings from the side and
showing by no means perforation. Ref. 55 on the other hand shows vastly larger rings (and only
rings) that sometimes lack Tom20 staining in their center (no perforation shown). I am not sure, if
either of these datasets allows the conclusion that these structures are lipidic pores.
3) On page 8, it is correctly stated that exposure of the C-terminal TMD allows dimerization, but
recent research has also shown that the TMD itself can dimerize.
4) The review gives a balanced overview of the current insights into BOK biology. This also
emphasizes BOK, which may not reflect its cellular impact compared to BAX and BAK. On the
other hand the importance of therapeutic targeting BAX/BAK regulation could become more
obvious to the non-expert reader, if the importance of this pathway for receptor-mediated
apoptosis in many circumstances is more emphasized.
5) The statement that BAX and BAK may not have tumor suppressive roles based on the lack of
evidence in the presence of the functionally redundant partner is perhaps not completely logic.
6) Referring to fig. 1 the authors introduce “multi-BH3-domain” proteins. I understand that these
proteins have more than one BH3 motif. Also BCL-2 is spelled inconsistently and the reference
Ranger et al. should be reformatted.

Overall, this is a detailed review covering the scope of Bcl-2 protein regulated apoptosis from the
basic protein function through to the recent application of BH3-mimetics in the clinic. This is a
well covered topic in the literature, but this article doe give a timely and up to date review and
combines this with much of the earlier work, such as the various gene ko models, and therefore
give the subject of therapies a broader context. I do have some minor issues.
Figure 1 and description of basic Bcl-2 protein biology underplays the role of membrane
targeting, which is essential for their function. This even extends to figure 1 outlining the
schematic structure of these proteins but with the essential and highly conserved membrane
targeting tails anchors omitted. I think the text and the figure need to have some mention of the
essential nature of membrane targeting, and show this feature in the figure. Membrane targeting
is mentioned for Bax and Bak, but the importance of the various interactions occurring in the
context of the mitochondrial membrane is not clear. Indeed, recent studies have indicated that
membrane association alters the binding between multi-domain and BH3-only proteins.
Figure 2 implies that BH3-mimetics can both inhibit the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and activate
the pro-apoptotic ones. The latter part is based upon the BTSA1 paper by Reyna. This may be a
bit picky, but I'm not sure that that compound has really been demonstrated to be a BH3-mimetic
in the same way that the more characterised compounds like ABT263 and 199 are. Perhaps some
qualification would benefit here to distinguish the two. I would say that a BH3-memetic would
bind into the canonical pocket on the anti-apoptotic proteins, but that has not been shown for
BTSA1.
Figure 3 is not really necessary, as the text description is perfectly clear and does not need further
clarification.

15-Feb-2018
Dear Dr Tait,
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0002 entitled "Targeting BCL-2
regulated apoptosis in cancer" has been accepted by the Editor for publication in Open Biology.
The reviewer(s) have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor revisions to your
manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments and revise your
manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
