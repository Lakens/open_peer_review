Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The authors compose a review article on the topic of engineering yeast (specifically, S. cerevisiae)
for the production of molecules related to fatty acid production. While the publication and topic
is timely for the field, there is a bit that can be improved for the delivery to better serve the field.
These are enumerated in the following points of consideration for the authors:
1. At the onset, the overall manuscript is not well balanced with nearly 1/3 of the references
coming from the authors of this paper. Immediately, this presents a bias in the article and does
not reflect well on the field as a whole given the work in this area. There are certainly many
either additional or alternative papers that should be cited as well.
2. The prospectives section was a bit weak and vague and not a great ending for the paper.
Simply stating the obvious (such as the fact that CRISRPR exists that better enzymes need to be
found for improving TRY) does not lead the reader to gain much perspective. A more
meaningful section should be included instead.
3. The premise that S. cerevisiae is used in ethanol production and thus will be a good host for
fatty acid production as it is well studied is a bit ill placed here. The authors should better
contextualize TRY values found here with other host organisms. This is true, especially when
values of the low mg/L are presented for molecules that are reported to be used as fuels—that
will require much higher titers.
4. The figures are rather simplified biochemical pathways that neglect both the regulation
inherent in these pathways as well as the fact that they do not showcase any of the “engineering”
aspect that is claimed in the title.

"Engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells for production of fatty acid derived biofuels and
chemicals" by Hu et al
Synopsis:
It is a very informative review about the advances in metabolic engineering of yeast for biofuels
production. The focus is restricted on using glucose/starch based feedstock and S. cerevisiae,
other carbon sources and organisms are not covered.
The introduction is separated into two parts, the first introducing the carbon flux and possibilities
in the yeast cell from sugar to the desired product, and the second part deals with the redox
balance in yeast, which is critical for the production of the highly reduced target compounds.
Native FA biosynthesis in yeast cells is introduced and possibilities of manipulating the FAS
complexes are presented, together with strategies and examples to enhance and change the FA
product spectrum by incorporating heterologous genes into yeast. The same is then applied to
other products, ordered by their chemical profile: fatty alcohols, alkanes/alkenes and fatty acid
esters. The final part "perspectives" presents further strategies and examples and highlights
recent developments.
The introduction and the main parts of the manuscript are overall very well written and
understandable and appear to cover almost everything essential from recent developments.
Only the "perspectives" part appears a bit shallow and provides neither a refined summary nor a
clear perspective for researchers in the field. A lot of new and exciting developments are only
very briefly mentioned with one or two references. Here, the authors should expand the focus a
bit from pure biofuel compounds to other fermentation products from yeast to find examples for
successful application of new concepts. Recent strategies such as biosensors or "product
addiction" are not included.
minor revisions:
a) page 5 line 6: (ACL) was overexpressed
4
b) page 5 line 11: malate synthase
c) page 12, lines 1 to 4: "implementation of dynamic regulation" this should be elaborated in a few
sentences. ALE is mentioned briefly, and could also be elaborated more. A connection to other
fermentation products should be made if no biofuels example is available. As a suggestion,
"biosensors" in combination with HTS strategies or "product addiction" could be mentioned as a
perspective, if no examples for application in biofuel production are available. They have been
successfully applied to other low- or medium value products.
d) page 14, lines 10 to 11: "In many cases, the poor performance of the key enzymes involved in
the different biosynthetic pathways is the major obstacle for improving product formation." - this
is a very true statement for all heterologous production attempts in yeast. Some examples and
possible explanations/reasons should be provided
e) page 14, line 23: "to meet the requirement of commercial application." A brief comparison of
the current biofuel-performance of yeast with other relevant host platforms should be given.
Absolute numbers and yields show up here and there in the manuscript, but summarized and
compared they would provide more value to the reader.
f) page 14, line 25: "In addition, adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) towards toxic chemicals is a
method that can benefit production of biofuels and other molecules" - see comment c)

Dear Dr Nielsen
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-19-0049 entitled "Engineering
Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells for production of fatty acid derived biofuels and chemicals" has
been accepted by the Editor for publication in Open Biology. The reviewer(s) have recommended
publication, but also suggest some minor revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you
to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments and revise your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
5
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".

submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
