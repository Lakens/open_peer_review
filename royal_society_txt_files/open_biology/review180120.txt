Review of :Tales from the crypt: intestinal niche signals in tissue renewal, plasticity and cancer,
by Spit et al
In this review, Spit et al review recent developments in the area of stem cells in the intestine, with
an emphasis on mechanisms and interconnectivity of signaling pathways.
Overall, it is fine and certainly useful review for readers entering the field. However, this is an
area of intense interest with many existing reviews already in the literature so it is hard to find
novel points of view. Smit et al have tried to cover as many pathways as possible, which is
laudable but it also generates a text that reads a bit like a catalogue.
A few comments.
Page 3
The authors state that “At present, two populations of ISCs have been described based on their
markers and localization”. I am not sure that there are only two populations. Are the cells
expressing Hopx, Lrig, Tert (page 4) indeed all identical to each other?
The discussion on the source of factors (Wnts) for crypt stem cells is a bit biased towards the
historical model that the Paneth cells make Wnt and are important. The authors subsequently
acknowledge that telocytes were recently demonstrated to be an additional source of Wnts, but
may include that the telocytes are essential and the Paneth cells are not. Same for the
mesenchymal cells Gli1+ cells. I would suggest to invert the order of discussing the various \
niche cells, starting with the essential telocytes and subsequently add the role of Paneth cells.
Figure 2 could be improved. First, indicating ß-catenin as just ß will be confusing to many.
Second, it looks like BMP signaling, through Smads, lead to proliferation. The opposite is the
case, as mentioned elsewhere in the review.

In this review, Maurice and colleagues gave a comprehensive update of how stem cell niche
signals control stem cell behavior during tissue homeostasis and how deregulation of niche
signaling leads to cancer using the mammalian intestinal system as the primary example. Overall,
this review is well structured and logically written, with a set of figures that help audience to
navigate the complexity of the signaling network that control intestinal stem cell self-renewal,
proliferation, and differentiation. The review covers most if not all the important literature in the
field and is quite up-to-date. I only have some few minor comments:
P4: The statement “The spectrum of stem cell activity displays heterogeneity, even within the
pool of cells expressing Lgr5” needs a reference (ref 39?). It might not be necessary to be put in a
separated paragraph.
P5 “Rspondins” should be “R-spondins”
P5: the second paragraph needs indentation and the third paragraph should be combined with
the second paragraph.
P9: It might be better to cite refs 87 and 88 at the beginning of the second paragraph.
P10: “Inhibition of Notch signalling results in rapid loss of CBC cells, indicating its requirement
for stem cell proliferation and survival [131]”.
--Is it clear that loss of CBC stem cells was due to cell death, precocious differentiation, or both?
P10-11 “Interestingly, VanDussen et al. concluded that Notch-mediated regulation of ISCs is
Math1 independent [131], whereas Van Es et al. showed the opposite [124]”.
-- VanDussen’s study only suggested that N regulation of Olfm4 expression (not ISC fate) is
Atoh1 independent. It role of Olfm4 in ISC regulation was not clear.

P11 and Fig 2, the authors should make it clear that Hh signaling not only blocks the production
of GliR but also converts full-length Gli into an activator form GliA.

Page 3
The authors state that “At present, two populations of ISCs have been described
based on their markers and localization”. I am not sure that there are only two
populations. Are the cells expressing Hopx, Lrig, Tert (page 4) indeed all identical to
each other?
We thank the reviewer for bringing this up and adapted the text accordingly.
The discussion on the source of factors (Wnts) for crypt stem cells is a bit biased
towards the historical model that the Paneth cells make Wnt and are important. The
authors subsequently acknowledge that telocytes were recently demonstrated to be
an additional source of Wnts, but may include that the telocytes are essential and
the Paneth cells are not. Same for the mesenchymal cells Gli1+ cells. I would
suggest to invert the order of discussing the various \ niche cells, starting with the
essential telocytes and subsequently add the role of Paneth cells.
We agree and have followed the referee’s suggestion by changing the order and
adapting the text to highlight the importance of telocytes as a Wnt source.
Figure 2 could be improved. First, indicating ß-catenin as just ß will be confusing to
many. Second, it looks like BMP signaling, through Smads, lead to proliferation. The
opposite is the case, as mentioned elsewhere in the review.
We have adapted Figure 2 according to the reviewer’s suggestions.

P4: The statement “The spectrum of stem cell activity displays heterogeneity, even
within the pool of cells expressing Lgr5” needs a reference (ref 39?). It might not be
necessary to be put in a separated paragraph.
We now addressed this point by inserting a reference at the indicated place in the
text.
P5 “Rspondins” should be “R-spondins”
Done.
P5: the second paragraph needs indentation and the third paragraph should be
combined with the second paragraph.
We adapted this this paragraph according to the suggestions of both reviewer 1 and
2
P9: It might be better to cite refs 87 and 88 at the beginning of the second
paragraph.
We agree and adapted this point.
P10: “Inhibition of Notch signalling results in rapid loss of CBC cells, indicating its
requirement for stem cell proliferation and survival [131]”.
--Is it clear that loss of CBC stem cells was due to cell death, precocious
differentiation, or both?
The study shows that Notch inhibition results in decreased CBC numbers due to both
apoptosis and precocious differentiation.
P10-11 “Interestingly, VanDussen et al. concluded that Notch-mediated regulation
of ISCs is Math1 independent [131], whereas Van Es et al. showed the opposite
[124]”.
-- VanDussen’s study only suggested that N regulation of Olfm4 expression (not ISC
fate) is Atoh1 independent. It role of Olfm4 in ISC regulation was not clear.
We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to our attention. The reviewer is
completely right that indeed VanDussen’s study only shows that the regulation of
Olfm4 expression by Notch1 inhibition is Atoh1/Math1 independent. They do not
show nor claim that ISC regulation by Notch1 is Atoh1/Math1 independent.
Actually, both reports claim that the regulation of cell fate is dependent on
Math1/Atoh1. Therefore, we have now adjusted the text accordingly by removing
this part.
P11 and Fig 2, the authors should make it clear that Hh signaling not only blocks the
production of GliR but also converts full-length Gli into an activator form GliA.
We thank the referee for this useful suggestion and updated Figure 2 and the text
accordingly, now including GliA.
