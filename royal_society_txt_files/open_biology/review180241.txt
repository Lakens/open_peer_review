This paper provides an analysis of genes of unknown function in eukaryotes, focusing on the well
characterized S pombe and applying this to genes conserved in humans. This is of high
importance and interest, as these unknown function genes represent a major gap in our
knowledge of the functioning of eukaryotic systems; in particular, elucidating the function of
conserved genes has relevance to understanding genes of relevance to human health.
The analysis uses a rigorous definition of unknown function, clearly distinguishing unannotated
from unknown.
The paper discusses potential reasons for the missing function gap, and provides a set of
strategies for closing the gap. I hope the paper is read not just by scientists but also funders of
science. The results confirm the fact that researchers are incentivized to research "safe" known
genes.
The discussion includes plausible hypotheses that are worth exploring further, such as the fact
that some functions will not be discovered under lab conditions as they pertain to poorly
understood ecology of the organism.

The authors present their comparative analysis of the unknown genes present in three eukaryotes
- S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and human. By curating the literature, they are able to assign biological
processes to a number of genes that had not been previously annotated, and are left with a list of
genes with no known biological process annotation. They examine various properties
(localization, catalytic activity) of this set of unknown genes, prioritizing them for future analysis.
This annotation work makes a useful contribution to the literature. Below are several suggestions
for ensuring that this manuscript and the associated data are as useful as possible to others in the
field.
The legend to Figure 3 describes the approach used for GO term assignment across species.
However, more detail is required than the final list of GO term IDs supplied in table S1. There
should be clear documentation of which terms were substituted for one another. It is imperative
to know these substitutions, since terms not listed in table s1 were deemed uninformative and led
to the annotation of “unknown.”
It would be helpful to include a supplementary table with the original annotations as used in the
analysis.
The 348 publications used for the manual curation of human would be helpful (and one would
assume are part of the GO submission). Please include these as part of table s7 or S10, or perhaps
a new table.
Table S10B seems to be missing.
Supplementary Figure 1 was not included for review.

Historically, a number of DUFs have turned out upon further study to encode catalytic domains.
The text should be revised to appropriately qualify the “non-catalytic” assignment.
The authors claim that the number of essential conserved unknown proteins is
disproportionately low; the statistics used to calculate this should be more clearly described.
The protein localization analysis of unknown proteins is interesting - have the authors considered
whether there are a disproportionate number of membrane proteins of unknown function due to
the biochemical challenges of characterizing these proteins?
Some explicit discussion of the use and limitations of the “Inferred from Electronic Analysis” GO
annotation would be helpful for readers.

p4, "activities captured by MF/CC make only a limited
contribution to a gene products characterization if taken in
isolation". Examples would be useful here. Some MF
annotations may provide major contributions, e.g. efflux
pumps, transcription factors.
Response
The text has been amended to:
“Although some MF terms (such as those describing transcription
factor activities, substrate-specific transmembrane transporter
activities, and some specific catalytic activities) implicitly refer to
physiological roles, biologically informative gene characterization
usually requires additional data to place the activity into a
broader physiological context.”
We also moved the text
“As an example, knowing that a protein is a kinase (MF) or a
ubiquitin ligase is not very informative until we find that a
deletion mutant of the gene encoding that protein is defective in
meiotic nuclear division (BP) and the protein itself localizes to
chromatin (CC).”
to the end of this paragraph since this is another example.
p4 mentions evidence code "no data", provide a link to
citation and/or documentation describing what this is.
Response
We have added two citations to this sentence (one URL and one
book chapter citation).
p4 provide 117 term slim as separate supplementary
download or provide a link
Response
The GO slim IDs are in supplementary Table S1. All term details
can be retrieved from a GO browser such as AmiGO
(http://amigo.geneontology.org/) or QuickGO
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/).
Referee: 2
The legend to Figure 3 describes the approach used for GO
term assignment across species. However, more detail is
required than the final list of GO term IDs supplied in table
S1. There should be clear documentation of which terms
were substituted for one another. It is imperative to know
these substitutions, since terms not listed in table s1 were
deemed uninformative and led to the annotation of
“unknown.”
It would be helpful to include a supplementary table with the
original annotations as used in the analysis.
Response:
We acknowledge that the description did not make our actual
method entirely clear.. We have amended the description to:
“The fission yeast slim also omits overly broad terms (e.g.
''metabolism'') and terms representing activities (molecular
functions) in the biological process ontology (e.g.
''phosphorylation'') because they do not add information about
physiological roles; these terms were also excluded from our
generic slim set even if inclusion would have increased coverage.
(Terms specifically considered but omitted from the generic slim:
GO:0055114 oxidation-reduction process; GO:0036211 protein
modification process; GO:0050896 response to stimulus).”
It is not practical to include a supplementary table of the original
annotations (for all 3 species it will be almost 0.5 million
annotations).
Instead we include an additional supplementary file of terms we
have explicitly excluded from the slims, but which had biological
process annotations (ancestors of these terms are also excluded).
The 348 publications used for the manual curation of human
would be helpful (and one would assume are part of the GO
submission). Please include these as part of table s7 or S10,
or perhaps a new table.
The GO annotations are now provided in supplementary table 11,
in GAF 2.1 format (http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-
file-gaf-format-21), which includes supporting references.
Table S10B seems to be missing.
Tables S10A and S10B are both included in the .xslx version of
the Table S10 file. Table S10B has been restored to the text (.tsv)
version.
Supplementary Figure 1 was not included for review.
We did submit Supplementary Figure 1 for review, and will
ensure that it is also included in the final submission.
Historically, a number of DUFs have turned out upon further
study to encode catalytic domains. The text should be
revised to appropriately qualify the “non-catalytic”
assignment.
We have changed the relevant passages. Main text:
“Unknown nuclear proteins are predicted to include more
transferases than other enzymatic activities; the set of nuclear
proteins shared only with eukaryotes includes 19 domains of
unknown function (DUFs) with no currently identifiable catalytic
domain, and 12 protein-protein interaction domains (e.g. WD,
ankyrin, or TPR) that frequently function as scaffolds for protein
complexes [18].”
Figure 3 legend:
“Proteins were classed as catalytic (i.e. having an identifiable
catalytic fold) or non-catalytic (no currently identifiable catalytic
fold) based on protein domain, fold, clan or superfamily
membership, using InterPro [18] and GO [7] assignments.”
The authors claim that the number of essential conserved
unknown proteins is disproportionately low; the statistics
used to calculate this should be more clearly described.
We have added the “known” values for comparison:
"The number of conserved unknown proteins that play an
essential role under permissive growth conditions is
disproportionally low (4.4%; 18/410, versus 1278/4376 (29.2%)
known, inferred, or published) ..."
The protein localization analysis of unknown proteins is
interesting - have the authors considered whether there are a
disproportionate number of membrane proteins of unknown
function due to the biochemical challenges of characterizing these
proteins?
The proportions of membrane proteins differ only slightly
between known and unknown:
unknown 19.51% 80/410
known 17.34% 759/4376
We have observed other factors that may influence the apparent
high frequency of membrane localization among the unknowns.
For example, longer length is very strongly correlated with
informative characterisation, and longer proteins are more likely
to have TM domains.
There is, however, a strong correlation between unknown status
and transmembrane domains for non-conserved (species
specific) proteins:
30.38% 86/283
especially considering these are also significantly shorter than
median protein length. This seems to indicate that either species-
specific membrane proteins of shorter length remain unstudied,
and/or it is much more difficult to identify orthologs for
membrane proteins of shorter length. We are interested in
looking into these possibilities in a future analysis. We
concentrated on conserved rather than non-conserved proteins
here.
Some explicit discussion of the use and limitations of the
“Inferred from Electronic Analysis” GO annotation would be
helpful for readers.
We do not think there are any limitations to the use of “Inferred
from Electronic Analysis” GO annotation in this context, and we
included annotations from all sources regardless of evidence
code in our analysis.
The only limitation we have observed is that IEA tend to be less
specific than manual annotations. We can demonstrate that IEA
annotations are >99% accurate for cell level processes, but we
would prefer to avoid a discussion of the relative merits of
different types of evidence codes when they do not affect the
analysis. Of course, there will be false positive annotations for
IEA, but the incidence is likely similar to manual term mis-
assignment or erroneous published data (“bad science”).
However, we should make it clear that we allowed manual and
electronically inferred evidence codes, because excluding
inferred evidence would have resulted in omission of some
proteins of known role (curators have not yet made manual
annotations to cover every high quality IEA annotation).
We have added a sentence to the Figure 3 legend:
“All evidence codes were included except reviewed
computational analysis (RCA), which yields a higher rate of false
positives than the others.”
Minor typographical points:
p. 2 “posit the benefits of completing catalog” - inert the/a as

These have been corrected.
