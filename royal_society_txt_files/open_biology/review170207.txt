The paper is based on clear and relevant data on the AVP receptor (AVPR) cross-talk with
ACKR3 and CXCR4 in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle function. The results provide
evidences that ACKR3 and AVPR1A heteromerize and the heteromerization contributes
AVPR1A-mediated Gaq signaling and reduced aVP-induced ß-arrestin recruitment to
AVPR1A. Also, AVPR1A:ACKR3 complex attenuates aVP mediated vasoconstriction. The
introduction is effective in explaining the rationale of the study, the experiments are well
designed and the results support the conclusions.
I have just minor remarks.
1) There is considerable interspecies variation in the V1R. In fact, the human V1R is only 80%
homologous with the rat V1R. This must be kept in mind when experiments performed in human
cells are used to justify the mechanism involved in the vasoconstriction evaluated in animal
studies. The authors should include this observation in the discussion.
2) In the graphic 1 seems that aVP by itself did not cause vasoconstriction or IP3 mobilization. Is
that related with aVP concentration? How was this concentration chosen? Maybe some more
discussion and justification is needed here.

The submission describes the potential heterodimerization of the atypical chemokine receptor 3,
ACKR3 with vasopressin receptor 1a. The authors use proximity ligation and co-
immunoprecipitation to reveal heterodimers.
While the hypothesis is plausible, the presented evidence is scarce and inconclusive.
Some specific points:
Figure 1c shows clearly that CXCL11 (3-73) is an agonist, however, the truncated chemokine
appers not to influence PE-induced vasoconstriction (1D and E). This needs more explanation.
Figure 1F: the affinity of CXCL12 for ACKR3 is more than 10fold higher, however, CXCL11
appears to have a stronger effect than CXCL12 in inhibiting aVP induced IP3 formation, why?
The PLA experiments are not clear at all. The use of polyclonal antibodies and secondary
antibodies is not straight-forward. All signals shown arise from nuclear or cytosolic areas and not
from the membrane perimeter, where the signal is expected.
The western blots need to be validated. The authors use tagged receptors, which could be used to
prove the detection of the receptors.
The use of NT siRNA appears to have similar effects as siRNA, why?
The authors state that siRNA depletes ACKR3 form the cell surface, but there is no evidence for
ACKR3 surface expression or downregulation.

The revised version still uses several – in part circumstantial evidences – to conclude that ACKR3
forms heterodimers with AVPR1A. Evidences include vasoconstrictions, IP3 formation, PLA, co-
7
immunoprecipitation, BRET, arrestin recruitment and transmembrane domain derived peptides.
Some of the data sets appear contradictory.
For most PLA images the derived conclusions are poorly or not at all visible. The image quality
needs improvement to support conclusions otherwise the quantifications appear biased.
The massive aggregation (Figure 12B) of tagged receptors cannot be taken as evidence, rather
appears to be an artifact, in particular as endogenous receptors appear not to from aggregates
(Figure 3).
Figure 3C is a 3D rendering not a deconvolution and does not show that PLA signals are derived
from the cell surface. Cell surface staining is required to demonstrate the site of the PLA reaction.
The PLA images of figure 4 are simply not interpretable.
Figure 5: the specificity of anti-ratACKR3 needs to be confirmed. From the images it appears that
ACKR3 siRNA reduces the PLA signal from AVPR1A:CXCR4?

ar Dr. Parham,
ank you very much for the opportunity to submit a revised version of the manuscript.
thermore, we would like to thank the reviewers for reading our paper and suggesting
ys in which we can improve it.
e manuscript has been revised according to the reviewers’ suggestions. Furthermore,
are happy to be able to present additional new data. In the revised manuscript, we
w also show that ACKR3 can be co-immunoprecipitated with AVPR1A in an
ression system (Fig. 2C), we provide evidence for constitutive heteromerization of
se receptors from intermolecular bioluminescence resonance energy transfer
eriments (Fig. 2D/E), document cell surface expression of PLA signals by 3D
onvolution imaging (Fig. 3C) and show that such heteromerization is also detectable
rat smooth muscle cell line (Fig. 5).
ase find below our detailed point-by-point response to the issues raised in the
iews. We hope that the manuscript is now acceptable for Open Biology.
looking forward to hear of your decision soon.
cerely yours,

There is considerable interspecies variation in the V1R. In fact, the human V1R is
y 80% homologous with the rat V1R. This must be kept in mind when experiments
formed in human cells are used to justify the mechanism involved in the
oconstriction evaluated in animal studies. The authors should include this
ervation in the discussion.”
sponse: Thank you very much for this suggestion. To exclude that sequence
erences between rat and human AVPR1A affect the ability of rat AVPR1A to form
eromeric complexes, we have performed PLA experiments with the rat smooth
scle cell line A7r5. These data are now described and discussed on page 10, lines 5-
and shown in the new Fig. 5.
In the graphic 1 seems that aVP by itself did not cause vasoconstriction or IP3
bilization. Is that related with aVP concentration? How was this concentration
sen? Maybe some more discussion and justification is needed here.”
sponse: In all pressure myography experiments (Fig. 1A/B/D/E), arteries were pre-
stricted with PE or aVP and the effects of vehicle (no change) and CXCR4/ACKR3
nds tested. This is described in the legend of Fig. 1 and in the results section (“…to
ess whether CXCR4 and/or ACKR3 activation influence aVP-induced constriction of
lated mesenteric resistance arteries..”). Fig. 1F shows that aVP induces IP3
bilization (white bars, ctrl.).
feree: 2:
gure 1c shows clearly that CXCL11 (3-73) is an agonist, however, the truncated
mokine appers not to influence PE-induced vasoconstriction (1D and E). This needs
re explanation.”
sponse: We have now discussed this observation in more detail (please see page 6,
s 5-8).
gure 1F: the affinity of CXCL12 for ACKR3 is more than 10fold higher, however,
CL11 appears to have a stronger effect than CXCL12 in inhibiting aVP induced IP3
mation, why?”
sponse: We have now commented on the relationship between receptor binding
nities and signaling properties of CXCL11 and CXCL12 on page 5, line 22 – page 6,
5. Furthermore, there were no differences between the antagonizing effects of
CL11 and CXCL12 in pressure myography experiments (please see page 5, line 19-
. Fig. 1F shows that aVP fails to induce IP3 formation when cells were pre-treated
h CXCL11 and CXCL12. Please note that IP3 formation in the presence and absence
aVP in cells pre-treated with CXCL12 was not significantly different. Thus, we
tained from further interpretation, such as discussing the possible role of CXCR4.
e PLA experiments are not clear at all. The use of polyclonal antibodies and
ondary antibodies is not straight-forward. All signals shown arise from nuclear or
osolic areas and not from the membrane perimeter, where the signal is expected.”
d “The authors state that siRNA depletes ACKR3 form the cell surface, but there is no
dence for ACKR3 surface expression or downregulation.”
sponse: We apologize that we did not explain the experiments in sufficient detail.
A images show merged images from 10 z-stack sections, bottom to top. This
lains the distribution of the signals in a two-dimensional image. This is now
lained in the methods section and in the figure legends. Furthermore, cells were not
meabilized, all anti-GPCR antibodies are directed against extracellular receptor
mains and have been validated for sufficient target selectivity (please see page 8,
s 9-11). In addition, we have now performed 3D deconvolution imaging to confirm
l surface localization (please see page 8, lines 16-19, page 22, lines 13-23, and the
w Figure 3C).
e western blots need to be validated. The authors use tagged receptors, which could
used to prove the detection of the receptors.”
sponse: Based on the reviewers’ suggestions, we have now performed additional
eriments to confirm heteromerization between AVPR1A and ACKR3, i.e. co-
munoprecipitation experiments with tagged receptors and intermolecular BRET
ays, which provide antibody-independent evidence for heteromerization. We now
vide the following lines of evidence for heteromerization:
1. Positive signals for heteromerization between HA-AVPR1A and FLAG-ACKR3 in
PLA with anti-HA and anti-FLAG.
2. New experiments indicating that FLAG-ACKR3 can be co-immunoprecipitated
with HA-AVPR1A (please see new Fig. 2C and page 7, lines 7-19).
3. New intermolecular BRET assays, indicating constitutive heteromerization
between AVPR1A and ACKR3 (please see new Figures 2D/E, page 7, line 20 –
page 8, line 5, page 19, line 19 – page 20, line 5 and page 25, line 20 – page 26,
line 14).
4. Positive signals for heteromerization between endogenous AVPR1A and ACKR3
in PLA experiments.
5. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing that endogenous ACKR3 can be
co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous AVPR1A utilizing validated antibodies.
e use of NT siRNA appears to have similar effects as siRNA, why?”
sponse: Unfortunately, we do not understand this comment. In all experiments in
ich we utilized siRNA (Figures 4-6), we have documented that the GPCR specific
NA was able to reduce expression of the specific GPCR target, as compared with
siRNA, and did not affect the expression of the other receptors that were analyzed.

gesting additional ways in which we can improve it.
e manuscript has been revised according to the suggestions of reviewer 2. To
vide evidence that the PLA signals corresponding to receptors and receptor
ractions are localized on the cell surface, we now demonstrate that antibodies do
reach intracellular compartments in non-permeabilized cells when PLA is performed
der our experimental conditions (please see Fig. 3A).

We hope that the manuscript is now acceptable for Open Biology.
looking forward to hear of your decision soon.

feree 1:
ank you for your detailed responses. The paper has been improved and I do not
e any further suggestions.”
sponse: Thank you very much.
feree 2:
e revised version still uses several – in part circumstantial evidences – to conclude
t ACKR3 forms heterodimers with AVPR1A. Evidences include vasoconstrictions,
formation, PLA, co-immunoprecipitation, BRET, arrestin recruitment and
nsmembrane domain derived peptides. Some of the data sets appear contradictory.”
sponse: We fully agree that we present multiple lines of convergent evidences,
ich all point towards heteromerization between ACKR3 and AVPR1A. Unfortunately,
do not know what data sets appear contradictory to the reviewer.
r most PLA images the derived conclusions are poorly or not at all visible. The image
ality needs improvement to support conclusions otherwise the quantifications appear
sed.” and “The PLA images of figure 4 are simply not interpretable.”
sponse: We believe that this is a problem of the low resolution of the pdf document
t the reviewer used for the review. The images are sharp and clean when inspected
igh resolution and clearly reflect the quantification. We have contacted the Editorial
ice in regards to this problem, and it appears that there is an issue with the resolution
he images that were provided for review. The Editorial Office advised us that high
olution images will be forwarded to the reviewer.
e massive aggregation (Figure 12B) of tagged receptors cannot be taken as
dence, rather appears to be an artifact, in particular as endogenous receptors appear
to from aggregates (Figure 3).”
sponse: We fully agree that the aggregation of the immunoreactivity in Fig. 2B is not
al and we have now described these findings with more caution (please see page 7,
s 18-19). Nevertheless, as no immunoreactivity was detectable in
munoprecipitation experiments with IgG, these data suggest a certain specificity and
monstrate that FLAG-immunoreactivity could be precipitated with anti-HA.
gure 3C is a 3D rendering not a deconvolution and does not show that PLA signals
derived from the cell surface. Cell surface staining is required to demonstrate the
of the PLA reaction.”
sponse: Based on the reviewer’s comments, we have stained hVSMC with FITC-
jugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, Sigma L4895) followed by PLA to perform co-
alization studies. Cell surface staining with WGA, however, interfered with the PLA
cedure, resulting in almost complete loss of PLA signals for all individual receptors
d receptor interactions. Thus, we regret that we are currently unable to demonstrate
site of the PLA reaction via co-localization.
wever, to provide another line of evidence that PLA signals are localized on the cell
face, we have performed PLA experiments with permeabilized and non-
meabilized cells to detect pMLC2. These experiments demonstrate that under our
A conditions antibodies do not reach intracellular compartments when cells have not
en permeabilized. This is now shown in Fig. 3A and described in the manuscript
ease see page 8, line 17 – page 9, line 3 and page 21, line 20 – page 22, line 4).
agree with the reviewer that we currently cannot provide direct and unequivocal
dence that AVPR1A:ACKR3 heteromers are localized on the plasma membrane.
wever, our findings which show that antibodies do not reach the intracellular
mpartments in non-permeabilized cells, in combination with the findings that
rference with heteromerization (by siRNA knockdown and TM-derived peptides)
es not affect expression of AVPR1A, but alters AVPR1A signaling upon exposure of
ls to an extracellular agonist, strongly support the conclusion that both receptors
ract on the cell surface. We have now discussed this point in more detail on page
line 15 – page 18, line 3.
reover, based on the reviewer’s comment, we reworded the text section on 3D
onvolution microscopy to the following: “This assumption is supported by 3D
onstruction of the PLA signals from deconvolved z-stack images, which showed that
st PLA signals for ACKR3:AVPR1A interactions are localized in a single plane (Fig.
).” (please see page 9, lines 3-6).
gure 5: the specificity of anti-ratACKR3 needs to be confirmed. From the images it
pears that ACKR3 siRNA reduces the PLA signal from AVPR1A:CXCR4?”
sponse: Fig. 5C shows that the PLA signal of anti-rat ACKR3 is reduced by 70% in
ls incubated with ACKR3 siRNA, as compared with cells incubated with non-targeting
NA, which demonstrates sufficient selectivity of the antibody.
ase note that in PLA the number of fluorescent spots and not the intensity of the
ividual signals are evaluated. The image in Fig. 5B for AVPR1A:CXCR4 interactions
ells incubated with ACKR3 siRNA shows much more signals than in cells incubated
h non-targeting siRNA, albeit with lower intensity. The number of signals are
ermined with the Duolink Image Tool software set to identical detection thresholds
each image, which were 66 for cells after incubation with ACKR3 siRNA and 21 for
ls incubated with non-targeting siRNA in the images for AVPR1A:CXCR4 interactions
wn in Fig. 5B. As mentioned above, we would like to encourage the reviewer to
pect the images in a high resolution format.
