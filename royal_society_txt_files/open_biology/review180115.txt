Good start but the flow of the manuscript for a review article still needs more work. I found a lot
of typos in the manuscript in the first couple of pages. In addition, I would like the tables and
images to be original or reformatted by the author. It seems like the authors just copied and
pasted the material, I am not sure if that material can be reprinted without special permission
from the referenced authors. The flow of the manuscript needs additional work. The images and
tables are truncated at times. The section titles and font not consistent through the manuscript.
Major revisions needed.

This is an interesting and useful for readers to understand epigenetics mechanism, and the effects
of ethanol and cannabinoid. The review is fair and covers most of the key papers. I have a few
suggestions, which the authors are free to consider.
The comments are listed below:
1. The review title: The current review has discoursed on the Epigenetic modulation of ethanol
and cannabinoid separately; however, the review has not discoursed the Epigenetic modulation
of ethanol and cannabinoid co-exposure as expected.
2. In “Introduction”, it will be better for readers to add more references to determine why it is
interesting and important to review “Epigenetic modulation of ethanol and cannabinoid co-
exposure”
3. The subtitle “Epigenetic and neuronal development to Alcohol and Cannabis induced neuro
modification in Adolescence and Adulthood” only discoursed the effect of ethanol, and do not
have any Cannabis’ content. It is good to merge this part into the subtitle “Epigenome and
Alcohol” as “Epigenetic and Alcohol/Ethanol”
4. In the “Epigenetic and Cannabis” part, there is only one reference paper (number 25); more
papers should be added to determine the epigenetic mechanism of cannabinoid. In addition,
Reference number 25, which is worry author’s order in the reference.
5. Currently, it is very unclear for understanding the interaction and epigenetic mechanisms of
alcohol and cannabinoid exposure. If authors want to further discuss the interaction between
ethanol and cannabinoid, possibly need more references in the review, such as Parira T et al.,
“Epigenetic Interactions between Alcohol and Cannabinergic Effects: Focus on Histone
Modification and DNA Methylation”, 2017…
6. Hope that authors can re-think the review structure. Suggesting for the order of the subtitle” 1.
Introduction; 2. Epigenetics definition and mechanism; 3. Epigenetics modulation of ethanol and
cannabinoid exposure, 3.1 Epigenetics and ethanol, 3.2 Epigenetics and cannabinoid; 3.3
Interaction between alcohol and cannabinoid or co-exposure; 4. Epigenetics analysis, 4.1
Epigenetics biomarkers, 4.2 Epigenetics methods; 5. Conclusion
7. References: It is the best way of sorting the sources numerically, and by the appearing

Appendix A
For Reviewer 1:
Thanks for addressing this. I agree that there were typos and some
grammatical errors, I proof read the Manuscript several times with Native
English speaker to make sure that the new version meets the publication
standards and readers satisfaction. I also re illustrated figure 2 and obtained
copy-write approvals for all the illustrations and figures from original authors
and the publishers. I also changed the formatting as per the journal standards
and I reformatted all citations as per the Journal style and as per the
appearance order in my Manuscript.
For Reviewer 2:
1.The review title: The current review has discoursed on the Epigenetic
modulation of ethanol and cannabinoid separately; however, the review has
not discoursed the Epigenetic modulation of ethanol and cannabinoid co-
exposure as expected
My response:
I changed the Manuscript title to " The Epigenetic modulation of Alcohol/
Ethanol and Cannabis Exposure/Co- exposure During Different Stages." and I
expanded the discussion on the co exposure area. However, there are not
many paper out there that discuss the Co exsposure of Ethanol and Cannabis
together this is why the point of the Manuscript is to bring attention to be
researched.
2.In “Introduction”, it will be better for readers to add more references
My response
I agree, I added around 10 more references to the review.
3- The subtitle “Epigenetic and neuronal development to Alcohol and
Cannabis induced neuro modification in Adolescence and ...
My response
I addressed that in the subtitle and in the discussion under that section. I added
more Cannabis discussion and references, however there are few studies that
are discussing the Cannabis effect within Epigenome area. I added What I
believed that its relevant to the discussion.
4.In the “Epigenetic and Cannabis” part, there is only one reference paper
(number 25)
My response
I added reference (43,44,45) in addition to 25. I also reordered the references
as per the appearance
5-. If authors want to further discuss the interaction between ethanol and
cannabinoid, possibly need more references in the review, such as Parira T et
al., “Epigenetic Interactions between Alcohol.
My Response
Thanks for providing this study,
I included it in my discussion. I also found that Parira et al review cited
similar articles such as Nagre et al and Subbanna et al when the author
discussed the Epigenetic part.
6-Hope that authors can re-think the review structure. Suggesting for the order
of the subtitle” 1. Introduction; 2. Epigenetics definition and mechanism; 3.
Epigenetics modulation of ethanol and cannabinoid exposure, 3.1 Epigenetics
and ..
My response
I reordered it this way. Thanks for highlighting it. I believe that it does make
more sense this way.
7.References: It is the best way of sorting the sources numerically, and by the
appearing sequence
My Response,
I listed the references numerically and I used Vancouver style according to the
journal’s guidelines.
