Let me start by saying that I profoundly enjoyed reading this ms. Having followed research on
the evolution of photosynthesis for several decades and having witnessed a plethora of mutually
contradictory evolutionary scenarios come and, unfortunately, rather than go, entrench
themselves, it is extremely refreshing to take a step back and see these “well-argued and
convincing” hypotheses as what they really are: wild speculations! As rightfully pointed out by
the author, this is because, in the absence of sufficient data, we tend to make up strings of a priori
arguments generating apparently logical houses of cards. I fully agree with the author that truly
progressing in this research field necessitates, apart from more empirical information, first and
for all a fundamental questioning of the prejudiced logic put forward to stabilize the old houses
of cards. Fittingly, the author entitled his piece as a variation to the heading of John Olson’s 2004
article; the spirit of the present paper is very much in line with John’s critical and non-conformist
way of thinking.
I therefore consider this article as perfectly suited for publication in Open Biology, apart from a
few passages which I will discuss in the following.
1 My main concern is with the top half of page 11, where the author tries to argue for an O2-
replete Archaean. While he is rightfully critical of flimsy arguments with respect to the evolution
of photosynthesis, here he does exactly what he accuses his colleagues of. He cites a string of
shaky papers suggesting O2 at the times of the LUCA. The Weiss paper has since its publication
become infamous and its methodological flaws have been pointed out in at least 10 more recent
articles. The phylogenetic evidences for pre-LUCA oxidases are indeed “not without
controversy” (which is quite an understatement) but, what the heck, let’s cite them nevertheless if
they go my way … The oxygen-tolerant enzymes may be quite old (and pre-date cyanos) but to
my understanding nobody ever claimed them to be as old as the LUCA. And if the hypothesis in
the Ettwig et al paper on O2-production from disproportionation of NO in anaerobic
methanotrophy is correct, that may explain why SODs and consortia have evolved relatively
early (not to mention that nitrosylating stress is very similar to ROS-stress and these enzymes
may initially have detoxified nitrosyl moieties).
I am aware that the author wants to leave the door open to the presence of a water-splitting RC
already in the LUCA. However, this doesn’t require stipulating an O2-replete environment since
(inefficient) early O2-evolution by an ancestral RC can have gone on for eons before they had a
perceptible impact on global oxygenation. So I don’t see why the author builds on extremely
controversial articles to argue against a solid mountain of palaeogeochemical evidences arguing
for an O2-free Hadean and Archaean.
2. The arguments in the lower half of page 11 to my mind don’t hold either. The author uses the
absence of anoxygenic 2-RC systems as evidence against anoxygenic-first scenarios. Here is my
take on that: Unless one believes that life started photosynthetically (I am not sure whether the
author envisages such beginnings but I certainly don’t!), photosynthetic RCs had to plug
3
themselves into pre-existing electron transfer chains. If you look at the positioning of RCs in these
chains (be they of RCI or RCII type), it is obvious that they replace terminal oxidants. This makes
perfect sense since (prior to ubiquitous O2 in the environment) oxidants were less abundant than
reductants and more readily limiting. Both RCII and RCI do this job and they even do it ok when
strongly reducing substrates become scarce and bugs are left to resort to the weakly reducing
ones. RCI might be more efficient under these conditions since it can reduce NAD directly
without having to tap into the membrane potential to make reverse electron transfer go.
However, if a bug dares to venture out into the open waters, far from hydrothermal sources of
reductants, it will get knackered – unless it manages to use water as a reductant, that is, invents a
water-oxidising RC. Note that it will still require the anoxygenic photosynthetic oxidant to ensure
pmf-generating electron flow. So, if you look at photosynthesis as life’s way to become
energetically independent of Mother Earth’s redox energy by tapping into heavenly sources of
entropic disequilibria, then it is obvious that an anoxygenic RC will be the first step (replacing
terminal oxidants) but going all the way to the middle of the ocean necessitates an oxygenic RC
replacing the reductants AND an anoxygenic RC replacing the oxidants. By contrast, two
anoxygenic RCs in the same chain wouldn’t make sense since they do the same job (just consider
your Gemmatimonadetes where an RCII photosynthesis has simply replaced an RCI-type one).
2. Last paragraph before “final words”. While extant life uses maturation systems to insert FeS
clusters, these clusters are natural entities. The maturation systems only enhance efficiency. You
can unfold most iron-sulphur cluster containing enzymes and just feed them iron chloride and
H2S and when you dialyse out the urea these enzymes will refold and contain native FeS clusters,
no maturation proteins needed. This is not the case for the Manganese cluster and the
resemblance of its geometry to mineral-type manganese containing entities is quite limited. It is a
product of PSII photochemistry and therefore less “natural” than for example iron-sulphur
centres.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
The ideas summarized here are interesting and thought provoking and the data reviewed here
from Cardona and colleagues has already been peer-reviewed for the original publications.
The purpose of the present document therefore appears to be to bring the new ideas from the
author to a wider audience who might be more familiar with earlier entrenched ideas regarding
the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis and the distribution of photosynthesis.
The target audience for this article is important since the author has adopted a rather informal
style e.g.,
“….. and [a] few years before I took the study of the evolution of photosynthesis as my full-time
job I came across an analogy that left me flabbergasted…”
“…our best scenarios for the origin and diversification of photosynthesis are like trying to predict
the size of a mountain from the shape of a [leaf] of grass…”
“What about other independent lines of evidence? Any clues?”
“How about early evolving oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases…substantially predate the mrca of
Cyanobacteria?”
The entire paragraph beginning” “If neither molecular evolution nor the geochemical record…”
The italics for emphasis in the statement: “There is absolutely no evidence that such a stage in the
evolution of anoxygenic photosynthesis ever existed”
The choice of the word “bizarre”
The above and a number of other examples risk, in my view, alienating others in the field who
have made (and are making) major contributions based on the evidence available to them and
who have contributed their own thought provoking ideas in the past (and quite recently in
several cases).
The author most likely intends no offence and other slip ups in language suggest the nuances
inherent in some of the criticisms of previous or alternative views may not be intentional but,
nevertheless, they do run the risk of coming across as arrogant or condescending. I suggest an
edit of the document, using a native speaker who is knowledgeable in photosynthesis, to remove
the more emotive language.
I enjoyed the scientific content and hold the author’s contributions in high regard.

Let me start by saying that I profoundly enjoyed reading this ms. Having followed

witnessed a plethora of mutually contradictory evolutionary scenarios come and,
unfortunately, rather than go, entrench themselves, it is extremely refreshing to
take a step back and see these “well-argued and convincing” hypotheses as what

present paper is very much in line with John’s critical and non-conformist way of
thinking.
I therefore consider this article as perfectly suited for publication in Open Biology,
apart from a few passages which I will discuss in the following.
1. My main concern is with the top half of page 11, where the author tries to argue
for an O2-replete Archaean. While he is rightfully critical of flimsy arguments with
respect to the evolution of photosynthesis, here he does exactly what he accuses his
colleagues of. He cites a string of shaky papers suggesting O2 at the times of the
LUCA. The Weiss paper has since its publication become infamous and its
methodological flaws have been pointed out in at least 10 more recent articles. The
phylogenetic evidences for pre-LUCA oxidases are indeed “not without controversy”

if they go my way … The oxygen-tolerant enzymes may be quite old (and pre-date

LUCA. And if the hypothesis in the Ettwig et al paper on O2-production from
disproportionation of NO in anaerobic methanotrophy is correct, that may explain
why SODs and consortia have evolved relatively early (not to mention that
nitrosylating stress is very similar to ROS-stress and these enzymes may initially

I am aware that the author wants to leave the door open to the presence of a
water-splitting RC already in the LUCA. However, this doesn’t require stipulating an
O2-replete environment since (inefficient) early O2-evolution by an ancestral RC can
have gone on for eons before they had a perceptible impact on global oxygenation.
So I don’t see why the author builds on extremely controversial articles to argue
against a solid mountain of palaeogeochemical evidences arguing for an O2-free
Hadean and Archaean.
I thank the reviewer for pointing this out and discussing the topic. I think I did not
make myself clear. I am not trying to argue for an O2 replete Archean: not at all. I am
trying to argue that neither molecular evolution data nor geochemical data have been
able to time the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis conclusively and to rule out that
photosynthetically derived O2 was not driving the evolution of early bioenergetics
and early life. Even if O2 did not accumulate in the atmosphere until the GOE.
I was also trying to say that both molecular evolution data and geochemical data have
been interpreted to suggest availability of O2 to life, and even possibly oxygenic
photosynthesis, as early as the earliest evidence for life. That does not necessarily
imply an O2 replete Archean.
In other words, my intention was to contrast the ambiguity of the data with the
confidence placed in the premise that anoxygenic photosynthesis predates oxygenic
photosynthesis.
I strongly agree with geochemical evidence for a very low-oxygen world prior to the
GOE, I want to make this clear: I do not dispute this. It is my understanding however,
that even though O2 was not accumulating globally there is substantial evidence for
O2 oases/whiffs or fluctuations of O2 long before the GOE.
In the words of Wang, Planavsky, Hofmann et al. (2018): “Further, not all pre-
2.4 Ga rocks have MIF-S signals, suggesting that oxygen levels likely fluctuated
dramatically during the Archean Era (Ohmoto et al., 2006, Ono et al., 2006). With a
small O2 reservoir, atmospheric oxygen levels were likely highly dynamic, with
oxygen concentrations varying significantly on short time scales.”
I want to restate that I am not using the controversial articles on the molecular
evolution of O2 reductase or the LUCA reconstructions to argue against geochemical
evidence. I only use them to point out that the interpretations of the molecular
evolution of O2 reductases and ROS-handling enzymes have been inconclusive on the
matter of when O2 becomes available to life for the first time.
The other point that I want to make is that I am not using potential evidence of early
O2 as an argument supporting the early origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. It is the
opposite:
The evolution of reaction centres suggests an early origin of oxygenic photosynthesis
irrespective of whether there were abiotic or other biological sources of O2; and
irrespective of the geological process that controlled the atmospheric composition
during the Archean. Therefore, given that the evolution of reaction centres indicates
an early origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, then evidence for early oxygen may be
better explained in the context of photosynthesis.
I have made the following changes to make my points clearer. The paragraph on
geochemical and palobiological evidence starts like this: “From a paleobiological and
geochemical perspective, the timing of the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis is far from
settled.” I have changed the start of the next paragraph on evidence from molecular
evolution to give more context on the point that I want to make: “Molecular evolution is
equally inconclusive on the timing of the origin of biological oxygen production.” I have
also added a short paragraph considering molecular clock studies on prokaryotes, all of
which suggest late origins for the known groups of anoxygenic phototrophs. I have also
made minor editions on the entire “Let there be light” section to make my points clearer
and following reviewer-2’s recommendations.
2. The arguments in the lower half of page 11 to my mind don’t hold either. The
author uses the absence of anoxygenic 2-RC systems as evidence against
anoxygenic-first scenarios. Here is my take on that: Unless one believes that life
started photosynthetically (I am not sure whether the author envisages such
beginnings but I certainly don’t!), photosynthetic RCs had to plug themselves into
pre-existing electron transfer chains. If you look at the positioning of RCs in these
chains (be they of RCI or RCII type), it is obvious that they replace terminal oxidants.
This makes perfect sense since (prior to ubiquitous O2 in the environment) oxidants
were less abundant than reductants and more readily limiting. Both RCII and RCI do
this job and they even do it ok when strongly reducing substrates become scarce
and bugs are left to resort to the weakly reducing ones. RCI might be more efficient
under these conditions since it can reduce NAD directly without having to tap into
the membrane potential to make reverse electron transfer go. However, if a bug
dares to venture out into the open waters, far from hydrothermal sources of
reductants, it will get knackered – unless it manages to use water as a reductant,
that is, invents a water-oxidising RC. Note that it will still require the anoxygenic
photosynthetic oxidant to ensure pmf-generating electron flow. So, if you look at
photosynthesis as life’s way to become energetically independent of Mother Earth’s
redox energy by tapping into heavenly sources of entropic disequilibria, then it is
obvious that an anoxygenic RC will be the first step (replacing terminal oxidants) but
going all the way to the middle of the ocean necessitates an oxygenic RC replacing
the reductants AND an anoxygenic RC replacing the oxidants. By contrast, two
anoxygenic RCs in the same chain wouldn’t make sense since they do the same job
(just consider your Gemmatimonadetes where an RCII photosynthesis has simply
replaced an RCI-type one).
The reviewer says that my arguments about the lack of anoxygenic 2-RC systems
don’t hold, but I think the reviewer actually agrees with me at the end. I would like to
comment on a few of the points made by the reviewer.
1. The reviewer wrote: “The author uses the absence of anoxygenic 2-RC systems as
evidence against anoxygenic-first scenarios.”
This is not quite the case. I use the absence of anoxygenic 2-RC systems to
demonstrate that the idea that anoxygenic photosynthesis predates oxygenic
photosynthesis is based on unsupported assumptions. Then, I argued that if the origin
of oxygenic photosynthesis is coincidental with the divergence of Type I and Type II
reaction centres, as the data actually suggests, then one not need to invoke this
unsupported assumption to make sense of the natural history of photosynthesis.
2. “(I am not sure whether the author envisages such beginnings but I certainly
don’t!)”
I must say that I have started to find the idea more and more appealing.
Unfortunately, I am not an expert on Origin of Life scenarios. Yet, Sam Granick in
his 1957 paper imagined an oxygenic photosynthetic origin of life. Quoting: “It
seems more reasonable to consider that the functions of oxidation and photosynthesis
were so fundamental that they were part of the first beginnings of protoplasm that
arose from inorganic origins.” Then he goes on to say: “I propose, as speculation,
that the earliest unit around which any living entity arose was an energy-conversion
unit. This unit of mineral origin would contain an organization of atoms that would
serve as a photocatalyst, at first perhaps in the decomposition of water by UV
radiation.”
However, it is not about whether one can envision such beginnings. It is about the
data itself.
My approach to understand the evolution of reaction centres has always been to
separate the speculation from those conclusions that are supported by data.
When I arrived to the field, I had no reason to doubt the starting assumption that
anoxygenic photosynthesis predates oxygenic photosynthesis. However, when I first
examined the evolution of reaction centres the first thing that I noticed is that the
relationship between the reaction centre proteins indicated, and I dare to say rather
conclusively, that the divergence of Type I and Type II RC proteins predates the
diversification of the major groups of bacteria (Cardona 2015). I also noted that the
phylogeny of the RC proteins quite puzzlingly showed that the cyanobacterial
sequences did not emerge from within the anoxygenic sequences (as it is expected
under traditional views), but made completely independent clades branching out at
the root.
After that, I tried to understand why Photosystem II is structurally and functionally
the way it is. The data suggest that in order to account for the structural
characteristics of Photosystem II and its oxygen-evolving complex, it is necessary
that water oxidation started at the evolutionary event that led to the two known types
of photochemical reaction centres (Cardona 2017, Cardona and Rutherford 2019,
Cardona et al. 2019). This is not my speculation, this is strongly constrained by the
structural characteristics of Photosystem II itself. The new structure of the
Heliobacteria RC only provided further support. These considerations consequently
place the origin of water oxidation at an early stage within the evolution of Bacteria,
at the latest. These conclusions are also consistent with the independent observation
that the span of time between the duplication of D1 and D2 and the most recent
common ancestor of cyanobacteria can be easily more than a billion years.
The reason I feel somewhat confident about this is because it has tremendous
explanatory power. Not only it explains why Photosystem II is the way it is, starting
from the curious ligand sphere of the Mn4CaO5 cluster and ending with its entire
structural architecture (Cardona 2017, Cardona and Rutherford 2019), but also it
equally explains why the phylogenies of RC proteins have the topology they do, and
it also explains the fact that there is no anoxygenic photosynthesis using the two
types of reaction centres.
I have now become very interested in the evolutionary parallels between (F/V-type)
ATP synthase and Photosystem II. I have found that across any point in time it looks
like Photosystem II is evolving more slowly than ATP synthase. This relationship is
even maintained through primary endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria at the origin of
photosynthetic eukaryotes. What is more, CP43 and CP47 are evolving slightly
slower than the alpha and beta subunits of ATP synthase, with D1 and D2 evolving
considerably slower; with the distance between alpha and beta being almost identical
to that between D1 and D2, and between CP43 and CP47. This is unpublished data,
but it can be easily confirmed by just doing a few sequence comparisons and as I
illustrated in Figure 4. I find no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the gene
duplication event leading to alpha and beta subunit of ATP synthase, a pre-LUCA
event, occurred before the duplications leading to D1 and D2 or CP43 and CP47, as
it is expected under the traditional view. The data taken at face-value appear to
suggest the opposite, that the D1/D2 and CP43/47 duplications are coincidental or
may slightly predate the duplication leading to alpha and beta. I think this deserves
further investigation and I am currently trying to get additional data on this.
But as I mentioned above, I had already shown that the divergence of Type I and
Type II reaction centre proteins likely predates the diversification of the major groups
of bacteria. I recently showed that the divergence of Type I and II, the divergence of
the L/M and D1/D2 lineages, and the duplication of D1 and D2, likely occurred soon
after the origin of reaction centre proteins (Cardona et al. 2019). Therefore, I do not
find puzzling or strange the fact that the evolutionary patterns of Photosystem II are
in many ways indistinguishable from those of ATP synthase. In fact, that is exactly
what one should expect.
Because of the above, I have become open-minded about the possibility of water
oxidation chemistry being important for the origin and evolution of bioenergetics and
the possibility of it emerging at any point in time between the Origin of Life and the
early diversification of Bacteria. I want to remind the reviewer that the spans of time
between the Origin of Life and the LUCA, and between the LUCA and the early
diversification of Bacteria are unknown.
The main issue, of course, is the fact that photosynthesis is restricted to few groups of
bacteria, and oxygenic photosynthesis to cyanobacteria alone. At a superficial look it
would seem as if photosynthesis was definitely a late innovation, and this has been
the only interpretative framework that we have had until now. However, the nature of
reaction centres and the chlorophyll synthesis pathway tell a completely different
story (as I have tried to make evident in this critical review): a story that is obscured
by the old interpretative framework. Once this framework is dismantled, a simpler
and consistent story with more explanatory power emerges. I hope at some point in
the not too distant future to have time and funding to write a dedicated and detailed
book on the evolution of photosynthesis.
3. The reviewer wrote: “If you look at the positioning of RCs in these chains (be they
of RCI or RCII type), it is obvious that they replace terminal oxidants.”
This is only obvious within the traditional interpretative framework of the evolution
of photosynthesis, which as I have tried to argue, is very problematic and biased
towards the idea that anoxygenic photosynthesis is the more plausible ancestral state.
While it appears reasonable, there is no support for it.
4. “However, if a bug dares to venture out into the open waters, far from
hydrothermal sources of reductants, it will get knackered – unless it manages to use
water as a reductant, that is, invents a water-oxidising RC. “
If that is correct, it would imply an early origin of oxygenic photosynthesis and soon
after the origin of life. As far as I understand, life was thriving in the Archean and
was not exclusively bound to hydrothermal environments, see for example (Homann
et al. 2015). So according to what the reviewer wrote, in order for life to leave its
cradle, it would need oxygenic photosynthesis. This would place oxygenic
photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life. I think the
reviewer agrees with me.
5. “By contrast, two anoxygenic RCs in the same chain wouldn’t make sense since
they do the same job”
Exactly! So, there’s a natural barrier that prevent this stage from emerging and
therefore cannot be considered a valid transitional stage towards the evolution of
oxygenic photosynthesis.
For a two-RC anoxygenic system to have emerged it needed to have provided a
selective advantage over single-RC anoxygenic system. If that would have been the
case, one would expect multiple events of two-RC anoxygenic systems emerging. In
fact, over billions of years, one would expect that it superseded single-RC
anoxygenic systems. But this clearly has not happened, which is indeed paradoxical.
The “two anoxygenic RCs in the same chain” is a paradoxical evolutionary transition
towards the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, and necessitates the incorporation of
unproven and unsupported assumptions, which is the exact point I want to make.
I have made the following changes to make my points clearer. I added a paragraph in
page 7 of the revised manuscript highlighting many independent molecular clock
studies of prokaryotes. These place each of the most recent common ancestors of
each group of phototroph at a late stage (e.g. about the GOE or after the GOE). It
further highlights that there is no evidence that anoxygenic photosynthesis has ever
existed in the absence of oxygenic photosynthesis. In addition, in the following
paragraph (start of page 8), I added a few sentences about what needs to be done to
prove conclusively that anoxygenic photosynthesis predate oxygenic photosynthesis,
which should help make things clearer regarding the current gaps in knowledge.
3. Last paragraph before “final words”. While extant life uses maturation systems to
insert FeS clusters, these clusters are natural entities. The maturation systems only
enhance efficiency. You can unfold most iron-sulphur cluster containing enzymes
and just feed them iron chloride and H2S and when you dialyse out the urea these
enzymes will refold and contain native FeS clusters, no maturation proteins needed.
This is not the case for the Manganese cluster and the resemblance of its geometry
to mineral-type manganese containing entities is quite limited. It is a product of PSII
photochemistry and therefore less “natural” than for example iron-sulphur centres.
I would like to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. It is indeed a weak argument
in the absence of a more detailed discussion of the potential implications of the
photoactivation process of the Mn4CaO5 cluster on the evolution of water oxidation. I
have decided to delete this paragraph.

Comments to the Author(s)
The ideas summarized here are interesting and thought provoking and the data
reviewed here from Cardona and colleagues has already been peer-reviewed for the
original publications.
The purpose of the present document therefore appears to be to bring the new
ideas from the author to a wider audience who might be more familiar with earlier
entrenched ideas regarding the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis and the
distribution of photosynthesis.
The target audience for this article is important since the author has adopted a
rather informal style e.g.,
“….. and [a] few years before I took the study of the evolution of photosynthesis as
my full-time job I came across an analogy that left me flabbergasted…”
“…our best scenarios for the origin and diversification of photosynthesis are like
trying to predict the size of a mountain from the shape of a [leaf] of grass…”
“What about other independent lines of evidence? Any clues?”
“How about early evolving oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases…substantially predate the
mrca of Cyanobacteria?”
The entire paragraph beginning “If neither molecular evolution nor the geochemical
record…”
The italics for emphasis in the statement: “There is absolutely no evidence that such
a stage in the evolution of anoxygenic photosynthesis ever existed”
The choice of the word “bizarre”
The above and a number of other examples risk, in my view, alienating others in the
field who have made (and are making) major contributions based on the evidence
available to them and who have contributed their own thought provoking ideas in
the past (and quite recently in several cases).
The author most likely intends no offence and other slip ups in language suggest the
nuances inherent in some of the criticisms of previous or alternative views may not
be intentional but, nevertheless, they do run the risk of coming across as arrogant
or condescending. I suggest an edit of the document, using a native speaker who is
knowledgeable in photosynthesis, to remove the more emotive language.
I enjoyed the scientific content and hold the author’s contributions in high regard.
I want to thank the reviewer for highlighting these issues of style. I do not mean any
offence and I do not intend to alienate others in the field. I did want to use a more
informal style to reach a broader audience and to make the article a more entertaining
read, I tried my best to not compromise in accuracy. I have edited all instances
highlighted by the reviewer above. I also asked my collaborator and friend, Prof.
Anthony Larkum to proof-read the manuscript as suggested by the reviewer. I hope
these changes make the manuscript more suitable for publication.
