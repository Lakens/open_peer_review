Comments to Author(s):
Finding novel RNA binding partners for Mei2 is of general interest to the meiosis community
however, the study stops short of substantiating the need to bind these novel RNAs, thus
decreasing its significance. At this point, the study seems incomplete. Further characterization of
one the RNAs with Mei2 would improve the manuscript.

The manuscript by Mukherjee and co-workers describes a study to identify additional RNA-
binding partners of the fission yeast Mei2 RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in
meiosis. Using two distinct approaches, RIP-CHIP and CLIP-seq, they identify six transcripts
including the well-characterized meiRNA. Notably, the mmi1 transcript (Mmi1 acts to inhibit
meiosis) is among these novel binding partners, suggesting that Mei2 regulates Mmi1 abundance
at both the protein and RNA level for added stringency. In addition, the rep2 transcript is another
Mei2 target, and the authors credibly suggest that this may represent a mechanism for altering
the composition of the MFP transcription factor as cells transition from mitosis to meiosis. The
study is well-controlled and the paper is well-written, addressing the area of protein-RNA
interactions that is of general interest to a wide audience.
I have no comments with regard to the experimental procedures and just a few minor comments
with regard to the writing.
In the paragraph from the Introduction that begins with “Mmi1 binds to a”, I would remove the
words “as many as” from the second sentence since based on the motif, there should be a specific
number of sequences matching that motif, even though they may not all serve as Mei2 binding
sites. Later in the paragraph, I would replace the word “excess” with something else
(additional?), as excess has a functional connotation that does not seem to be justified in this
sentence.
Finally, with regard to the Introduction, a concluding sentence is warranted, as the authors do
suggest some mechanistic relevance to their data and should take credit for it here.
In the first paragraph of the Materials and Methods section, SPA and ME media should be
defined as was done for EMM. In addition, the final three sentences of this paragraph seem to be
out of place as they refer to the treatment of cells for IP studies, which does not fall under the
heading of strains, media, and growth conditions.
In the final section of the Results and Discussion, artifactual is misspelled, however, it might be
that the authors really mean to say that it is not coincidental.
Lastly, the authors should carefully review the References. There is an extra hyphen at the end of
14, and there are missing journal or book names in 16 and 19. A more careful read through this
may turn up additional errors.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
Mukherjee et al. have identified the RNA targets of the RNA-binding protein Mei2 by two
genomic methods: RIP and CLIP. I think that the data are robust and properly handled. This
paper is largely descriptive. It would greatly benefit from follow up experiments that investigate
the functional consequence of Mei2 binding to its targets. It is unclear whether Mei2 is acting to
positively or negatively regulate the gene expression of its targets. Does it act on RNA turnover
or translational efficiency? None of these questions are broached by the experiments. However,
since Mei2 is such an important protein for meiotic entry, I think that the paper will be of interest
to the field and constitutes a publishable unit with minor revisions.
In my opinion the broader questions of the paper should be put forth in the introduction and
abstract. As written the paper is about one protein: Mei2. The reader either cares about this
protein or they do not. I think it would be useful to broaden the introduction to include the key
questions. For example: because mei2 mutants are blocked before pre-meiotic S-phase one may
state that by determining the targets of Mei2 we will gain valuable insight into mRNAs that must
be properly regulated to promote meiotic entry. Furthermore, the experimental rationale is not
clear in many cases. The text often describes a method before explaining the question motivating
the experiment.
Additional comments:
Introduction:
1) It is unclear whether the sme2 locus encodes a protein-encoding gene or just the non-coding
meiRNA. It also may be useful to briefly mention the evidence that meiRNA is non-coding.
2) “Mei2 protein apparently shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and meiRNA is
required to keep Mei2 protein in the nucleus during meiosis”
This sentence is unclear. Shuttles implies a back-and-forth motion- is this the case? Does this
occur during meiosis? If meiRNA keeps Mei2 in the nucleus then how does it shuttle?
Results
1) The opening sentence is “We used Western blotting to determine when Mei2 protein was
5
expressed during meiosis.” I think it would be useful to explain to the reader why determining
this information is important.
2) Figure S1 should include no-tag controls if possible
3) Figure S2B: Include in the legend an explanation of U and T
4) Explain “manually browsed.” Why not a peak-finding algorithm? What were the thresholds of
target ID?
5) “RNAs were assayed by DNA sequencing” Include that they were reverse transcribed
otherwise it’s confusing
6) Figure S3: rec8 and mei4 feel cherry-picked. In order to test if enrichment is a function of gene
expression it is often useful to make a plot of enrichment vs expression for all genes for which
information is available. Then you could mark the targets a different color dot on the plot. Would
this be possible?

Appendix A
Response to Referees.
The reviews overall were quite favorable and helpful (and very kind).
Both Referees had some similar comments on our presentation,
particularly in the Introduction, but to some extent also in the results.
The core issue was that our rationale was poorly presented. Upon re-
reading, the Referees were clearly right, and in retrospect we were
surprised at how poor our presentation was. We have fairly
extensively re-written the Introduction (and some other places) to fix
this. This re-writing does not change the science, but does present our
rationale and the history and context of the subject more clearly.
Referee 1
In the paragraph from the Introduction that begins with “Mmi1 binds to
a”, I would remove the words “as many as” from the second sentence
since based on the motif, there should be a specific number of
sequences matching that motif, even though they may not all serve as
Mei2 binding sites. Later in the paragraph, I would replace the word
“excess” with something else (additional?), as excess has a functional
connotation that does not seem to be justified in this sentence.
Ok, we have changed the wording as the Referee suggests.
Finally, with regard to the Introduction, a concluding sentence is
warranted, as the authors do suggest some mechanistic relevance to
their data and should take credit for it here.
The Referee is right, and we have made extensive changes to the
Introduction along these lines, as indicated by both Referees.
In the first paragraph of the Materials and Methods section, SPA and
ME media should be defined as was done for EMM. In addition, the
final three sentences of this paragraph seem to be out of place as they
refer to the treatment of cells for IP studies, which does not fall under
the heading of strains, media, and growth conditions.
Done
In the final section of the Results and Discussion, artifactual is
misspelled, however, it might be that the authors really mean to say
that it is not coincidental.
We have changed to “not coincidental”.
Lastly, the authors should carefully review the References. There is an
extra hyphen at the end of 14, and there are missing journal or book
names in 16 and 19. A more careful read through this may turn up
additional errors.
Somehow our Endnote library contained many mistakes. We made a
new Endnote library, and hopefully all the errors have been corrected.
Referee 2
In my opinion the broader questions of the paper should be put forth in
the introduction and abstract. As written the paper is about one protein:
Mei2. The reader either cares about this protein or they do not. I think it
would be useful to broaden the introduction to include the key
questions. For example: because mei2 mutants are blocked before
pre-meiotic S-phase one may state that by determining the targets of
Mei2 we will gain valuable insight into mRNAs that must be properly
regulated to promote meiotic entry.
Yes, the Referee identifies important weaknesses in our presentation.
We have somewhat improved the title and abstract, and have largely
re-written the Introduction to provide more context. This is similar to
comments of Referee 1.
Furthermore, the experimental rationale is not clear in many cases.
The text often describes a method before explaining the question
motivating the experiment.
We have made improvements as suggested.
Additional comments:
Introduction:
1) It is unclear whether the sme2 locus encodes a protein-encoding
gene or just the non-coding meiRNA. It also may be useful to briefly
mention the evidence that meiRNA is non-coding.
meiRNA is encoded by the sme2 gene. Watanabe et al. (1994) looked
at all possible ORFs in the sme2/meiRNA transcript, and saw that the
biggest one could encode a 58 amino acid protein; the second biggest
was just 16 amino acids. With respect to the 58-codon ORF, they
mutated the ATG start codon; they inserted a stop codon, and they
created an internal frameshift. None of these mutations genetically
inactivated sme2+. We have changed the wording so that it is now
more clear that the evidence that sme2 encodes a lncRNA, and not a
protein, is in the Watanabe (1994) paper. However, we did not actually
give the evidence, as we felt it was distracting at this point, and
because the conclusion is generally accepted in the field, and has
been strongly backed up by subsequent studies on meiRNA.
2) “Mei2 protein apparently shuttles between the cytoplasm and
nucleus, and meiRNA is required to keep Mei2 protein in the nucleus
during meiosis”
This sentence is unclear. Shuttles implies a back-and-forth motion- is
this the case? Does this occur during meiosis? If meiRNA keeps Mei2
in the nucleus then how does it shuttle?
The Sato et al (2002) paper says that during vegetative growth the little
Mei2 that is made might make it to the cytoplasm but is actively
exported back to the nucleus, from which it can emerge again. They
say that “Mei2p intrinsically undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling”, by
which they mean that the protein alone, when not bound to meiRNA,
can shuttle back-and-forth. Their idea is that in meiosis, Mei2 remains
steadfastly trapped in the nucleus because of meiRNA binding. We
have modified the sentence and paragraph to make it clearer.
Results
1) The opening sentence is “We used Western blotting to determine
when Mei2 protein was expressed during meiosis.” I think it would be
useful to explain to the reader why determining this information is
important.
Yes, we have done this. It is a good suggestion. In general, at several
places in the manuscript, our rationale is obscure, and we have made
improvements along these lines at several places.
2) Figure S1 should include no-tag controls if possible.
No tag controls are shown in Figure S2 and we saw no bands. Also,
Supplementary figure legends state that untagged controls showed no
bands (data not shown).
3) Figure S2B: Include in the legend an explanation of U and T.
Yes, U and T are now explained directly on the Figure.
4) Explain “manually browsed.” Why not a peak-finding algorithm?
What were the thresholds of target ID?
The data in question are from tiling arrays. We do not know of any
peak-finding algorithm for tiling array data. Of course, there are peak
finding algorithms for sequencing data, but tiling arrays are different.
We did use a peak-calling algorithm for our CLIP-seq results. We have
been very conservative with our target determination using two
different methods.
5) “RNAs were assayed by DNA sequencing” Include that they were
reverse transcribed otherwise it’s confusing.
Yes, this is now done.
6) Figure S3: rec8 and mei4 feel cherry-picked. In order to test if
enrichment is a function of gene expression it is often useful to make a
plot of enrichment vs expression for all genes for which information is
available. Then you could mark the targets a different color dot on the
plot. Would this be possible?
This is a good idea, but at this point (with Dr. Mukherjee having moved
to his post-doc lab) it would be very tough for us to do. For the reason
the referee is thinking, we did look at a lot of highly expressed meiotic
genes (just on the browser) and none were enriched after RIP or CLIP.
Rec8 and mei4 are not cherry-picked; other genes you might think of
look similar.
