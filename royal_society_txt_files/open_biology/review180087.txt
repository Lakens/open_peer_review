This is an important review which would be of interest to dengue researchers. I have a few
comments which would strengthen the review.
1. What is the importance of studying organ-specific / skin immune responses?
2. How has understanding the immune responses in the skin helped in the development of
therapeutics for other types of infections?
3. Can the author provide more background to support the claim that "Understanding the initial
events of immune responses to DENV infection is crucial for progress towards robust strategies
against DENV"?
4. Page 9, "Innate immune pathways important for DENV detection and protection", In some
cases, it is not clear what studies of the innate immune pathways mentioned are related or
unrelated to the skin.
5. Page 13, Second paragraph, The author states that "T cells are under-represented in the
literature with respect to DENV". There are a significant number of publications that evaluate T
cell immune response to dengue infections. I would agree with this statement if they are
referring to the immune response of T cells in the skin.

Reviewer’s comments for manuscript RSOB-18-0087, entitled “Immune responses to dengue in
the skin” submitted to Open Biology
This review gives a broad and precise panorama of the processes following mosquito-mediated
dengue virus (DENV) transmission in the skin. As the article includes a comprehensive overview
of the infected myeloid cell types as well as their immune responses, this contribution will surely
help scientist new to the fields and from various fields, as well as experts to gain a rapid
knowledge of the state of the art. Specifically, the sections on mast cells or the role of mosquito
saliva in the DENV-infected skin are very interesting, as these are areas with still many open
research questions and active research. The manuscript is well written and easy to understand
and is a substantial contribution to the field as well as a broader audience. The authors also
provide good visualization of the dense network of dendritic cells and mast cells, as well as
degranulation of mast cells following DENV-inoculation into the skin.
Specific Comments
• I would change the title to “Immune responses to dengue virus transmission in the skin”, as
“dengue” refers to the disease and the disease is systemic, whereas in the skin, dengue virus is
transmitted and replicates.
• Please provide a more detailed image caption text that describes Figure 2.
• In future manuscripts, please provide line numbering to facilitate specific references to the text
during the revision process.
• The sentence on page 12 “A recent study also showed immune cell…” is incomplete or is
lacking a verb prior to “as well DENV enhancing antibodies”. Please complete, likely with “in the
presence of DENV-enhancing antibodies”.
• I would propose to include a more specific title for the section starting at the bottom of page 11,
as e.g. “Mosquito saliva influencing DENV infection”.
• The then following section at the bottom of page 12 could be titled e.g. “Antibody and T cell
responses influencing DENV infection outcome”.
• Along the same lines, I would move the last sentence of the section ending on page 11
(“Interestingly, during acute…”) together with the later discussion on T cell responses on page 13
“Finally, T cells, …”.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewer Comments
Reviewer 1:
This is an important review which would be of interest to dengue researchers. I have a
few comments which would strengthen the review.
We thank the reviewer for emphasizing the importance of the review and for the
suggestions for improvement.
1. What is the importance of studying organ-specific / skin immune responses?
The main reason for studying skin immune responses is because it is the natural route of
infection for DENV. This is discussed p. 5 and we added another emphasis of this on p.
3, lines 52-53.
2. How has understanding the immune responses in the skin helped in the development
of therapeutics for other types of infections?
We have now cited a study which showed that immunity in the skin was more protective
compared to other sites of exposure, which supports this concept (p. 4, lines 79-84).
3. Can the author provide more background to support the claim that "Understanding the
initial events of immune responses to DENV infection is crucial for progress towards
robust strategies against DENV"?
To address this, we have added citation 7, which shows skin specific immune responses
could be exploited for improved vaccine responses in the context of another virus.
4. Page 9, "Innate immune pathways important for DENV detection and protection", In
some cases, it is not clear what studies of the innate immune pathways mentioned are
related or unrelated to the skin.
Because innate immune pathways are evolutionarily conserved, this is not a major factor
in terms of the skin being a unique site. For the sake of completeness and the fact that
we are looking at early responses prior to initiation of the adaptive immune response, we
thought it was important to detail how innate activation would occur to DENV. This
happens first in the skin but could occur elsewhere. We have clarified this by adding this
point to lines 220-223. We also added the information when a study was performed with
an especially relevant cell type to the skin, such as keratinocytes (lines 232-233).
5. Page 13, Second paragraph, The author states that "T cells are under-represented in
the literature with respect to DENV". There are a significant number of publications that
evaluate T cell immune response to dengue infections. I would agree with this statement
if they are referring to the immune response of T cells in the skin.
We added “infection of the skin” to lines 337-338.

Reviewer’s comments for manuscript RSOB-18-0087, entitled “Immune responses to
dengue in the skin” submitted to Open Biology
Response to Reviewer Comments
This review gives a broad and precise panorama of the processes following mosquito-
mediated dengue virus (DENV) transmission in the skin. As the article includes a
comprehensive overview of the infected myeloid cell types as well as their immune
responses, this contribution will surely help scientist new to the fields and from various
fields, as well as experts to gain a rapid knowledge of the state of the art. Specifically,
the sections on mast cells or the role of mosquito saliva in the DENV-infected skin are
very interesting, as these are areas with still many open research questions and active
research. The manuscript is well written and easy to understand and is a substantial
contribution to the field as well as a broader audience. The authors also provide good
visualization of the dense network of dendritic cells and mast cells, as well as
degranulation of mast cells following DENV-inoculation into the skin.
We appreciate these supportive comments and the reviewer’s careful reading. We have
addressed each of the specific comments below.
Specific Comments
• I would change the title to “Immune responses to dengue virus transmission in the
skin”, as “dengue” refers to the disease and the disease is systemic, whereas in the skin,
dengue virus is transmitted and replicates.
We appreciate the suggestion and have changed this to read “Immune responses to
dengue virus in the skin”. We did not include the word transmission because we thought
that it did not fully capture the scope of the review, which includes immune responses at
later time points in the skin and skin-associated manifestations of dengue disease.
• Please provide a more detailed image caption text that describes Figure 2.
We have now provided the detailed Figure 2 description.
• In future manuscripts, please provide line numbering to facilitate specific references to
the text during the revision process.
Line numbers have been added.
• The sentence on page 12 “A recent study also showed immune cell…” is incomplete or
is lacking a verb prior to “as well DENV enhancing antibodies”. Please complete, likely
with “in the presence of DENV-enhancing antibodies”.
This has been corrected.
• I would propose to include a more specific title for the section starting at the bottom of
page 11, as e.g. “Mosquito saliva influencing DENV infection”.
We have now added “mosquito” to the section title.
• The then following section at the bottom of page 12 could be titled e.g. “Antibody and T
cell responses influencing DENV infection outcome”.
We discuss the interplay between mosquito and host immune factors throughout this
section and did not want to separate them fully to allow this discussion of the combined
Response to Reviewer Comments
influence of the products, so we have changed the heading to read “mosquito and host
factors” rather than splitting the section.
• Along the same lines, I would move the last sentence of the section ending on page 11
(“Interestingly, during acute…”) together with the later discussion on T cell responses on
page 13 “Finally, T cells, …”.
We appreciate the reviewer’s comment, but the section where this is contained is about
virus clearance and includes references to multiple types of immune cells that can
promote clearance. Therefore, T cells are included as a functional grouping with NKT,
NK and other cytotoxic cells and this occurs during both primary and secondary immune
responses. We feel removing them from this paragraph would not give the full picture
regarding DENV clearance from the skin. In contrast, the second section is not meant to
be about T cell responses specifically but to describe the varied ways that host immune
factors can influence the course of DENV infection, one of these being adaptive
immunity, which means that T cells should be mentioned again.
