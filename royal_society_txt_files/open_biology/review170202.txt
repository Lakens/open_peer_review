In this manuscript, the authors showed that knockdown of LIMK1 results in mitotic centrosome
defocusing, multipolar spindle, and lower accumulation of PCM proteins (such as AurkA, PLK1,
NuMA) at the spindle poles. They also showed that the defects in LIMK1-knockdown cells are
3
recovered by expression of DYNC1LI1/2 and that knockdown of DYNC1LI1/2 causes the defects
similar to those induced by LIMK1 knockdown. Finally, they showed evidence that DYNC1LIs
are bound to LIMK1, but not LIMK2, and phosphorylated by LIMK1 in mitotic cells. Based on
these results, the authors propose a model that LIMK1 plays roles in the accumulation of PCM
proteins to the mitotic spindle poles and thereby mitotic centrosome integrity through
phosphorylating DYNC1LI1/2 and regulating the interaction between dynein and PCM proteins
and the transport of PCM proteins to the mitotic centrosomes. The manuscript contains some
novel and interesting findings, but the authors did not show any clear evidence for the
mechanism by which LIMK1 regulates DYNC1LI function in centrosomal protein transport. It is
unclear whether LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation of DYNC1LIs actually affects the interaction
between dynein and PCM proteins and the function of DYNC1LIs in centrosomal transport of
PCM proteins. Thus, the data are not sufficient for supporting the model proposed by the
authors. In addition, there are several points that should be addressed, as described below.
1) Fig. 1a. To confirm that the immunostaining signals of LIMK1 actually reflect the localization
of endogenous LIMK1, it is essential to show that LIMK1 knockdown extinguishes the
fluorescence signals of LIMK1 in Fig. 1a. It is also better to show whether fluorescent protein-
tagged LIMK1 also localizes to the centrosomes.
2) Fig. 4. It is required to show the data on the levels of expression of LIMK1 and its mutant
proteins by immunoblot analysis.
3) Fig. 4b and 4c. Data for cells transfected with control siRNA and empty vector are required as
the controls to estimate the extent of recovery.
4) Fig. 5. It is required to show the data of the levels of expression of DYNC1LI1/2 proteins by
immunoblot analysis.
5) Page 11, line 206-208. Fig. 5d showed that the fluorescence intensity of TubGCP2 does not
change after LIMK1 siRNA treatment, so it was not restored by DYNC1LI1/2 overexpression.
6) Fig. 5. If LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation is required for the function of DYNC1LI1/2 in
centrosomal transport of PCM proteins and centrosome integrity, why can overexpression of
DYNC1LI1/2 rescue the phenotype of LIMK1-knockdown cells? In LIMK1-knockdown cells,
DYNC1LIs are not phosphorylated and are expected to be inactive for transporting PCM
proteins.
7) Fig. 6. To validate the effects of DYNC1LI1/2 siRNAs, immunoblot data on the levels of
endogenous DYNC1LI1/2 proteins are required. Does LIC1 siRNA affect the expression of LIC2
and vice versa?
8) Fig. 7a. It is interesting to know whether the interaction between LIMK1 and DYNC1LIs is
specific in M-phase or cell cycle-independent.
9) Fig. 7b. It is required to show the immunoblot data of GST, GST-LIMK1 and its fragments in
pull-down precipitates.
10) It is unclear how LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation of DYNC1LI1/2 promotes accumulation
of PCM proteins. Further experiments are required to show whether or not LIMK1-mediated
phosphorylation of DYNC1LIs promotes the interaction between dynein and PCM proteins and
promotes the function of DYNC1LIs in centrosomal transport of PCM proteins in mitotic phase.

Sirong et al show that LIMK1 localizes to mitotic centrosomes, and that its depletion leads to
spindle multipolarity as a result of centrosome fragmentation. This was accompanied by a
reduction in a variety of PCM-associated proteins including Pericentrin, NuMA, AurkA and Plk1,
and g-Tub - though interestingly not all components of the gTuRC. Spindle multipolarity,
centrosome spread, and PCM recruitment were all complemented by active, but not KD versions
of LIMK1 suggesting that the effects of LIMK1 depletion were due to loss of its catalytic activity.
The proteins whose levels are reduced at the PCM in LMK1 depleted cells are all cargoes of
dynein, and LMK1 depletion was rescued by DYNC1LI (LIC) 1 and 2, while depletion of these
LICs phenocopied LIMK1 depletion. LIMK1 co-IPs with both LIC1 and LIC2, phosphorylates
both in vitro, and both are phosphorylated in vivo in a LIMK1-dependent manner. Based on
these observations, the authors argue that LIMK1 regulates LIC1 and LIC2 to control PCM
integrity during mitosis.
Overall, this is a very nice study that presents the novel finding that an actin-associated protein
kinase regulates the dynein-mediated maintenance of centrosome integrity during mitosis.
Generally, the data are of high quality and provide strong support for the authors’ conclusions.
There are however some apparent inconsistencies that should be addressed, and some minor
concerns.
Major Concerns:
1) The authors argue that LMK1 depletion leads to a centrosome spreading phenotype, for which
they provide quantification. However, the images in Fig 1d don’t do a particularly good job
illustrating the centrosome spread. One spindle pole in the middle panel appears spread (though
fragmented might be a better description), but it is not clear to me that the spindle poles in the
bottom panel are significantly larger than those in the top (control) panel. It seems likely that the
authors chose the images in Fig 1d to illustrate spindle multipolarity, which they do nicely, but
perhaps additional images that better illustrate the centrosome spreading phenotype could be
5
identified - either in place of the images shown, or as additional images to support that particular
point (the entire cell does not seem necessary to make this point, so perhaps cropped images
showing just centrosomes could be appended to the graph in Fig 1f).
2) The authors conclude that levels of several PCM proteins are reduced in LMK1 depleted cells,
and both the provided quantification and the examination of isolated centrosomes support this.
However, at least in the versions of figures available for review, the images in the various figures
(Fig 3b, Fig 5a, Fig 5c, Fig 6c) do not do a particularly good job illustrating this reduction.
3) What happens when LMK1-depleted cells complete mitosis? It is quite surprising that roughly
80% of these cells have multipolar spindles yet flow cytometry shows that there is no change in
DNA content - e.g. no cytokinesis failure or significant aneuploidy. Do the extra spindle poles
cluster prior to cytokinesis? Do the cells fail in cytokinesis? Arrest in the subsequent cell cycle? I
think this is an important point to establish.
4) If LICs are LMK1 substrates that mediate LIMK1 function in centrosome integrity, and LMK1
activity is required for centrosome integrity, how is it that overexpression of LICs can suppress
the loss of LIMK1 activity? Wouldn’t they still need to be phosphorylated? I don’t know that the
authors need to address this point experimentally, but should at least discuss how they reconcile
the requirement for kinase activity with the observation that simple overexpression of LICs can
bypass the need for LIMK1 kinase activity.
5) It seems that the authors could do a little more to test and/or refine their model. Specifically,
their model predicts the possibility that LIC1 and LIC2 themselves localize to centrosomes in a
LIMK1-dependent manner. This is likely not the only possibility, but it seems that examining the
centrosomal accumulation of LIC1 and LIC2 in LIMK1 depleted cells would allow them to refine
the model of how LIMK1 modulates their function. The authors might also determine whether
LICs can interact with the KD version of LIMK1 to determine whether the interaction requires
LIMK1 kinase activity.
Minor concerns:
1) I disagree with the characterization that LIMK1 co-localizes with Centrin 3 (pg 5 lines 50-51,
Fig 1a). Clearly this experiments shows LIMK1 to be at centrosomes, but it is clearly a PCM
protein and not a centriole protein. It seems that a PCM marker would be more appropriate for
Fig 1, but failing that I would suggest a wording other than co-localization for two proteins found
at different centrosomal locations.
2) The authors’ description of the various phenotypes associated spindle multipolarity seems a bit
off to me. In particular, the description of phenotypes 3 and 4 seems to be something of a straw
man argument, and do not seem to acknowledge the possibility of premature centriole separation
- that is, that the total number of centrioles in a multipolar spindle could be four yet more than
two poles might have at least one centriole. Perhaps this is what the authors mean when they
talk about centriole “fragmentation,” but centriole fragmentation evokes the physical
disintegration of centrioles rater than the premature separation of centriole pairs. Indeed, from
the images shown in Fig 2c it would appear to be the case that all spindles shown have just four
centrioles, even when more than two poles contain centrioles. Clarification around the
presentation of this point would be helpful.
3) While it may be difficult to come up with a good control, it is important to note that there is no
control for either total or relative protein levels in isolated centrosomes in Fig S3.
4) Given that dynein function is microtubule dependent, the use of Nocodazole arrest to examine
interactions with LICs brings up some interesting questions. The data suggest that the LIMK1-
6
LIC interactions do not require microtubules, but either LIMK1 centrosomal localization or
function in PCM integrity might be microtubule dependent. This is particularly interesting given
the conclusion that LICs are downstream of LIMK1 in the regulation of centrosome integrity. At
a minimum, the possibility that this seems worthy of some discussion.
5) The blots in Figure 7b should be better labeled. Specifically, it is difficult to determine which
blots were probed with which antibodies. One presumes the top panels were probed with anti-
GST and the bottom with anti-Flag, but that should be indicated on the figure for ease of
interpretation.

The manuscript and the figures are greatly improved. The authors have attempted to address all
the issues that I have raised. There are still some minor points missing.
The fact that LIMK1 depleted cells are able to complete cytokinesis, despite the abnormal spindle
11
phenotypes will question all the readers. The current discussion of that point is incomplete. The
authors suggest that LIMK2 activity could compensate for the absence of LIMK1. This does not fit
with their results indicating that LIMK2 is not able to control LIC2. The additional explanations
(LIMK1 possibly not required for cytokinesis, inactivation of extra spindle poles) provided in the
response to the referee would shed light on this puzzling observation.
The abbreviations (TubGCP2, AurKA, etc.) should be introduced.

label_comment_5
The authors do not show clear evidence for the mechanism by which LIMK1 regulates LICs
function in centrosomal protein transport. It is unclear whether LIMK1 promotes or suppresses
the function of LICs to transport centrosomal proteins.
In the revised manuscript, the authors provided additional data (Suppl. Fig. S10) showing that
expression of kinase-dead LIMK1 increases the speed of cargo (PLK1) transport, which suggests
that LIMK1 has the function to suppress the transport function of LICs. By contrast, the authors
also showed that depletion of LIMK1 caused lower accumulation of PCM proteins at spindle
12
poles and expression of LICs restored the centrosomal protein levels at the spindle poles in
LIMK1-depleted cells, which indicates that LIMK1 promotes the function of LICs to transport
centrosomal proteins to spindle poles. If LIMK1 suppresses the transport function of LICs, it is
unclear why LIMK1 depletion causes lower accumulation of centrosomal proteins, rather than
excess accumulation of these proteins. To make clear these contradictory results on LIMK1
function, it is required to provide direct evidence showing whether LIMK1-mediated
phosphorylation of LICs promotes or suppresses the interaction between LICs and centrosomal
proteins.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors do not show clear evidence for the mechanism by which LIMK1 regulates LICs
function in centrosomal protein transport. It is unclear whether LIMK1 promotes or suppresses
the function of LICs to transport centrosomal proteins.
In the revised manuscript, the authors provided additional data (Suppl. Fig. S10) showing that
expression of kinase-dead LIMK1 increases the speed of cargo (PLK1) transport, which suggests
that LIMK1 has the function to suppress the transport function of LICs. By contrast, the authors
also showed that depletion of LIMK1 caused lower accumulation of PCM proteins at spindle
poles and expression of LICs restored the centrosomal protein levels at the spindle poles in
LIMK1-depleted cells, which indicates that LIMK1 promotes the function of LICs to transport
centrosomal proteins to spindle poles. If LIMK1 suppresses the transport function of LICs, it is
unclear why LIMK1 depletion causes lower accumulation of centrosomal proteins, rather than
excess accumulation of these proteins. To make clear these contradictory results on LIMK1
function, it is required to provide direct evidence showing whether LIMK1-mediated
phosphorylation of LICs promotes or suppresses the interaction between LICs and centrosomal
proteins.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript and the figures are greatly improved. The authors have attempted to address all
the issues that I have raised. There are still some minor points missing.
The fact that LIMK1 depleted cells are able to complete cytokinesis, despite the abnormal spindle
phenotypes will question all the readers. The current discussion of that point is incomplete. The
authors suggest that LIMK2 activity could compensate for the absence of LIMK1. This does not fit
with their results indicating that LIMK2 is not able to control LIC2. The additional explanations
(LIMK1 possibly not required for cytokinesis, inactivation of extra spindle poles) provided in the
response to the referee would shed light on this puzzling observation.
The abbreviations (TubGCP2, AurKA, etc.) should be introduced.

Appendix A
Comments to the authors
n this manuscript, the authors report that LIMK1 controls centrosome integrity through
phosphorylation of dynein light intermediate chains (DYNC1LI1 and DYNC1LI2). These conclusions are
based mainly on image analysis and quantification of cells knocked down for LIMK1. The observed
phenotype is pheno-copied with dynein light intermediate chains siRNA and rescued when DYNC1LI1
and DYNC1LI2 constructs are introduced into LIMK1-siRNA treated cells.
Then, the authors show that LIMK1 but not LIMK2 interacts with DYNC1LI1 and 2, as these proteins
co-immuno-precipitated with LIMK1. Finally they show using PhosphoTag PAGE analysis that LIMK1
iRNA but not LIMK2 siRNA reduce the level of phosphorylation of DYNC1LI1 and 2. This result is
consolidated with in vitro experiment using recombinant LIMK1 and DYNC1LI1 and 2, showing that
LIMK1 is able to phosphorylate DYNC1LI1 and 2.
The manuscript is clear and straight-forward. The results support, to a large extent, the conclusions.
Moreover, from a mechanistic point of view, these results are new and exciting.
Besides several minor points, which I will detail below, there are however two major points that
need to be reinforced.
1) The authors clearly show (Fig 1) that nearly 80 % of the LIMK1-depleted cells form multi-
polar mitotic spindles. This must have a consequence in the progress of the cell cycle. Yet,
the authors do no detect any cytokinesis failure, nor multinucleated cells, nor cell cycle
arrest. No consequence of such abnormal spindles is highly improbable and the authors
should look for apoptosis, G1 arrest, etc…
2) The fact that dynein light chains intermediate are new substrates of LIMK1 (exclusively, not
of LIMK2) is a novel, exciting result. A western blot with phosphotyrosine antibody would re-
inforce and refine the results (as it has been shown that LIMK1 can also phosphorylate
tyrosine), or an experiment showing that P32 is not incorporated into DYNC light chains
when LIMK1 is absent or inhibited. Finally, I would suggest the author to conduct a functional
in vitro assay showing that dynein activity is impaired when phosphorylated by LIMK1.
Minor points:

<U+F0B7> P5L50 "LIMK1 was observed to co-localize with Centrin 3 (centriole marker) from prophase
through to metaphase (Fig. 1a)." Looking closely to the pictures, it is not really a co-
localization. It looks like LIMK1 is localized close to the centrioles, but does not superimpose.

they delimited?
<U+F0B7> P5L55 "This loss of LIMK1 from the centrosome coincided with the appearance of the kinase
at the site between the two newly formed nuclei and the mid-body". I don't understand the
localization of LIMK1 regarding the mid-body. There is no staining of the mid-body. Thus the
authors can't conclude that LIMK1 is localized between the nuclei and the mid-body.
Moreover, LIMK1 localization resembles to the expected mid-body localization.

solidated with in vitro experiment using recombinant LIMK1 and DYNC1LI1 and 2, showing that
K1 is able to phosphorylate DYNC1LI1 and 2.
manuscript is clear and straight-forward. The results support, to a large extent, the conclusions.
reover, from a mechanistic point of view, these results are new and exciting. Besides several minor
nts, which I will detail below, there are however two major points that need to be reinforced.
he authors clearly show (Fig 1) that nearly 80 % of the LIMK1-depleted cells form multipolar mitotic
dles. This must have a consequence in the progress of the cell cycle. Yet, the authors do no detect any
kinesis failure, nor multinucleated cells, nor cell cycle arrest. No consequence of such abnormal
dles is highly improbable and the authors should look for apoptosis, G1 arrest, etc…
ly: We thank the reviewers for their comment and suggestion. Please see below the point-by-point
y. Please also note that we have replaced DYNC1LI1 and DYNC1LI2 with LIC1 and LIC2 for easier
ding and more consistency between the text and figures.
checked the levels of PARP and Caspase-3 (the cleaved products of these two proteins are markers of
ptosis) from 24 hours to 96 hours after siRNA transfection (supplementary Fig. S4a). No observable
vage of PARP and Caspase-3 was detected in the control and LIMK1 knockdown cells, suggesting that
sient LIMK1 knockdown did not lead to obvious apoptosis. We have also investigated the levels of
e cell cycle markers such as G1/S phase marker phospho-CDK2 (Tyr15) and M phase marker phospho-
one3 (Ser10). Although no significant difference was observed between the control and LIMK1
ckdown cells in terms of phospho-CDK2 (Tyr15) level, cells with LIMK1 knockdown showed higher
spho-Histone H3 levels than the control cells. This suggests that there is higher portion of mitotic but
G1 and S phase cells in the LIMK1 knockdown situation. Besides Western blot, we have conducted
S to investigate the DNA content of cells transfected with control and LIMK1 siRNA (Fig.2 and
plementary Fig. S4b, c). The control and LIMK1 knockdown cells showed similar DNA profile from 24
6 hours post siRNA transfection, suggesting that the LIMK1 knockdown cells can go through a few
nds of cell cycle and silencing of LIMK1 does not lead to obvious aneuploidy.
observations that cells with LIMK1 knockdown are capable of completing cytokinesis might be due to
sible redundant function of LIMK2 as LIMK2 is localized to the midzone microtubules during anaphase
1
elophase [1]. It is also possible that the activity of LIMK1 is not required for cytokinesis as LIMK1 is
erphosphorylated at the onset of M phase and gradually becomes inactivated during telophase and
kinesis [2, 3]. Although we observe multi-polar spindle in LIMK1 knockdown cells, these extra spindle
es may eventually coalescence/cluster to become bi-polar spindle before anaphase onset especially in
cer cells [4].
he fact that dynein light chains intermediate are new substrates of LIMK1 (exclusively, not of
K2) is a novel, exciting result. A western blot with phosphotyrosine antibody would reinforce and
ne the results (as it has been shown that LIMK1 can also phosphorylate tyrosine), or an experiment
wing that P32 is not incorporated into DYNC light chains when LIMK1 is absent or inhibited. Finally,
ould suggest the author to conduct a functional in vitro assay showing that dynein activity is impaired
n phosphorylated by LIMK1.
ly: As suggested by the referee, we have conducted an in vitro kinase assay using anti-phospho-
sine antibody to detect if there is any tyrosine residues within LIC1 and LIC2 that might be
sphorylated by LIMK1. Indeed, we observed positive anti-phospho-tyrosine bands (Fig. S9C).
PLK1 is a reported cargo of dynein[5], we have investigated the activity of dynein by tracking the
sport of PLK1 in cells transfected with control or different mutants of LIMK1 (Supplementary Fig. S10).
new experimental data suggest that overexpression of the kinase-dead LIMK1 (D460A) changed the
avior of dynein as cells transfected with the kinase-dead mutant exhibited faster speed of cargo
sport when compared to the control cells or cells overexpressing the kinase-active LIMK1 (T508EE).
observation suggests that LIMK1 is required for fine tuning the activity of dynein. LIMK1 knockdown
ht impede the fidelity of cargo transport. That is why cells with LIMK1 knockdown show multiple
trosomal foci or defocused centrosome. Currently, we do not know the phosphorylation sites of LIMK1
LICs. Earlier reports have suggested that increased LIC phosphorylation is correlated to decreased
ein-based membrane transport and implicated Cdc2 kinase [6, 7]. Here, we identify LIMK1 as a new
ulator of dynein based transport.

mments to the Author(s)
his manuscript, the authors showed that knockdown of LIMK1 results in mitotic centrosome
ocusing, multipolar spindle, and lower accumulation of PCM proteins (such as AurkA, PLK1, NuMA)
he spindle poles. They also showed that the defects in LIMK1-knockdown cells are recovered by
ression of DYNC1LI1/2 and that knockdown of DYNC1LI1/2 causes the defects similar to those
uced by LIMK1 knockdown. Finally, they showed evidence that DYNC1LIs are bound to LIMK1, but
LIMK2, and phosphorylated by LIMK1 in mitotic cells. Based on these results, the authors propose a
del that LIMK1 plays roles in the accumulation of PCM proteins to the mitotic spindle poles and
eby mitotic centrosome integrity through phosphorylating DYNC1LI1/2 and regulating the interaction
ween dynein and PCM proteins and the transport of PCM proteins to the mitotic centrosomes. The
uscript contains some novel and interesting findings, but the authors did not show any clear evidence
the mechanism by which LIMK1 regulates DYNC1LI function in centrosomal protein transport. It is
lear whether LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation of DYNC1LIs actually affects the interaction between
ein and PCM proteins and the function of DYNC1LIs in centrosomal transport of PCM proteins.
s, the data are not sufficient for supporting the model proposed by the authors. In addition, there are
eral points that should be addressed, as described below.
ly: We now have new experimental data (Fig. S10) to suggest that the trafficking of dynein cargo is
cted by LIMK1 activity. As PLK1 is a reported cargo of dynein[5], we have investigated the activity of
ein by tracking the transport of PLK1 in cells transfected with control or different mutants of LIMK1
pplementary Fig. S10). Our new experimental data suggest that overexpression of the kinase-dead
K1 (D460A) changed the behavior of dynein as cells transfected with the kinase-dead mutant exhibited
er speed of cargo transport when compared to the control cells or cells overexpressing the kinase-
ve LIMK1 (T508EE). This observation suggests that LIMK1 is required for fine tuning the activity of
ein. LIMK1 knockdown might impede the fidelity of cargo transport. That is why cells with LIMK1
ckdown show multiple centrosomal foci or defocused centrosome. Currently, we do not know the
sphorylation sites of LIMK1 on LICs. Earlier reports have suggested that increased LIC phosphorylation
orrelated to decreased dynein-based membrane transport and implicated Cdc2 kinase [6, 7]. Here, we
ntify LIMK1 as a new regulator of dynein based transport.
ig. 1a. To confirm that the immunostaining signals of LIMK1 actually reflect the localization of
ogenous LIMK1, it is essential to show that LIMK1 knockdown extinguishes the fluorescence signals
IMK1 in Fig. 1a. It is also better to show whether fluorescent protein-tagged LIMK1 also localizes to
centrosomes.
ly: We knocked down LIMK1 using siRNA, and immuno-stained the cells with anti-LIMK1 antibody.

unoblot analysis.

age 11, line 206-208. Fig. 5d showed that the fluorescence intensity of TubGCP2 does not change
r LIMK1 siRNA treatment, so it was not restored by DYNC1LI1/2 overexpression.
ly: Yes, it was not restored. We have changed the text. See Page 11 Line 206 -208.
ig. 5. If LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation is required for the function of DYNC1LI1/2 in
trosomal transport of PCM proteins and centrosome integrity, why can overexpression of
NC1LI1/2 rescue the phenotype of LIMK1-knockdown cells? In LIMK1-knockdown cells,
NC1LIs are not phosphorylated and are expected to be inactive for transporting PCM proteins.
ly: We proposed that LIMK1 phosphorylation of DYNC1LI1/2 (LIC1/2) is required for proper transport
ction of cytoplasmic dynein-1; yet when we overexpressed LIC1/2 constructs, we are able to rescue
LIMK1-knockdown phenotype. One possible explanation is that under the situation of
rexpression, LIMK2 or other kinases might be able to phosphorylate the abundant LICs. Other
ses such as Cdc2 kinase has been reported to phosphorylate LIC and regulate dynein transport [6].
rnatively, the residual amount of the remaining LIMK1 is capable of phosphorylating a portion of the
rexpressed LICs.
ig. 6. To validate the effects of DYNC1LI1/2 siRNAs, immunoblot data on the levels of endogenous
NC1LI1/2 proteins are required. Does LIC1 siRNA affect the expression of LIC2 and vice versa?
ly: Please refer to supplementary Fig. S8c for expression of LIC1 and 2 in cells transfected with LIC1
IC2 siRNAs. LIC1 siRNA does not affect the expression of LIC2 and vice versa.
ig. 7a. It is interesting to know whether the interaction between LIMK1 and DYNC1LIs is specific in
hase or cell cycle-independent.
ly: We have performed additional co-IP experiment to detect the interaction of LIMK1 with LICs in
h asynchronized cells and cells synchronized at M-phase (supplementary Fig. S9a). Although we
erve interaction of LIMK1 and LICs at interphase, we do not observe phosphorylation of LICs at
rphase (Fig. 8a).

ly: We have included the immunoblot data requested in Figure 7b.
It is unclear how LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation of DYNC1LI1/2 promotes accumulation of PCM
eins. Further experiments are required to show whether or not LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation of
NC1LIs promotes the interaction between dynein and PCM proteins and promotes the function of
NC1LIs in centrosomal transport of PCM proteins in mitotic phase.
ly: Our new experimental data suggest that silencing LIMK1 changed the behavior of dynein transport
m tracking of dynein cargoes (supplementary Fig. S10). As PLK1 is a reported cargo of dynein[5], we
e investigated the activity of dynein by tracking the transport of PLK1 in cells transfected with control
different mutants of LIMK1 (Supplementary Fig. S10). Our new experimental data suggest that
rexpression of the kinase-dead LIMK1 (D460A) changed the behavior of dynein as cells transfected
h the kinase-dead mutant exhibited faster speed of cargo transport when compared to the control
s or cells overexpressing the kinase-active LIMK1 (T508EE). This observation suggests that LIMK1 is
uired for fine tuning the activity of dynein. LIMK1 knockdown might impede the fidelity of cargo
sport. That is why cells with LIMK1 knockdown show multiple centrosomal foci or defocused
trosome. Currently, we do not know the phosphorylation sites of LIMK1 on LICs. Earlier reports have
gested that increased LIC phosphorylation is correlated to decreased dynein-based membrane
sport and implicated Cdc2 kinase [6, 7]. Here, we identify LIMK1 as a new regulator of dynein-based
sport.

mments to the Author(s)
ng et al show that LIMK1 localizes to mitotic centrosomes, and that its depletion leads to spindle
tipolarity as a result of centrosome fragmentation. This was accompanied by a reduction in a variety
CM associated proteins including Pericentrin, NuMA, AurkA and Plk1, and g-Tub – though
restingly not all components of the gTuRC. Spindle multipolarity, centrosome spread, and PCM
uitment were all complemented by active, but not KD versions of LIMK1 suggesting that the effects
IMK1 depletion were due to loss of its catalytic activity. The proteins whose levels are reduced at the
M in LIMK1 depleted cells are all cargoes of dynein, and LIMK1 depletion was rescued by DYNC1LI
C) 1 and 2, while depletion of these LICs phenocopied LIMK1 depletion. LIMK1 co-IPs with both
1 and LIC2, phosphorylates both in vitro, and both are phosphorylated in vivo in a LIMK1-dependent
ner. Based on these observations, the authors argue that LIMK1 regulates LIC1 and LIC2 to control
M integrity during mitosis.
rall, this is a very nice study that presents the novel finding that an actin-associated protein kinase
ulates the dynein-mediated maintenance of centrosome integrity during mitosis. Generally, the data are
igh quality and provide strong support for the authors’ conclusions. There are however some apparent
nsistencies that should be addressed, and some minor concerns.
or Concerns:
he authors argue that LMK1 depletion leads to a centrosome spreading phenotype, for which they
vide quantification. However, the images in Fig 1d don’t do a particularly good job illustrating the
trosome spread. One spindle pole in the middle panel appears spread (though fragmented might be a
er description), but it is not clear to me that the spindle poles in the bottom panel are significantly
er than those in the top (control) panel. It seems likely that the authors chose the images in Fig 1d to
strate spindle multipolarity, which they do nicely, but perhaps additional images that better illustrate
centrosome spreading phenotype could be identified - either in place of the images shown, or as
itional images to support that particular point (the entire cell does not seem necessary to make this
nt, so perhaps cropped images showing just centrosomes could be appended to the graph in Fig 1f).
ly: Silencing LIMK1 leads to two phenotypes: (1) defocused or fragmented centrosome and (2)
tipolar spindle. We have images showing these two phenotypes in Fig 1d. In cases of multipolar
dles, the centrosomes usually do not show as extensive defocusing as in cases where are two
trosomes. Other example of defocused/spread centrosomes and multi-polar spindles is shown in Fig.
he authors conclude that levels of several PCM proteins are reduced in LMK1 depleted cells, and
h the provided quantification and the examination of isolated centrosomes support this. However, at
t in the versions of figures available for review, the images in the various figures (Fig 3b, Fig 5a, Fig
Fig 6c) do not do a particularly good job illustrating this reduction.
ly: We have replaced Fig 3b with a new imaging show both centrosome spreading and multipolar
trosomes. However, we explained in point 1, we do not observe extensive defocused centrosomes
multi-polar centrosome in the same cell. One possible reason is the fragmentation of defocused
trosomes into multi-polar centrosomes.
What happens when LMK1-depleted cells complete mitosis? It is quite surprising that roughly 80% of
e cells have multipolar spindles yet flow cytometry shows that there is no change in DNA content -
9
no cytokinesis failure or significant aneuploidy. Do the extra spindle poles cluster prior to
kinesis? Do the cells fail in cytokinesis? Arrest in the subsequent cell cycle? I think this is an
ortant point to establish.
ly: Yes, it is rather surprising to us too. We have tracked the control and LIMK1 knockdown cells
ugh a couple of cell cycles and did not observe cytokinesis failure and obvious apoptosis
plementary Fig. S4). We have also checked if apoptosis might be a possible explanation.
checked the levels of PARP and Caspase-3 (the cleaved products of these two proteins are markers of
ptosis) from 24 hours to 96 hours after siRNA transfection (supplementary Fig. S4a). No observable
vage of PARP and Caspase-3 was detected in the control and LIMK1 knockdown cells, suggesting that
sient LIMK1 knockdown did not lead to obvious apoptosis. We have also investigated the levels of
e cell cycle markers such as G1/S phase marker phospho-CDK2 (Tyr15) and M phase marker phospho-
one3 (Ser10). Although no significant difference was observed between the control and LIMK1
ckdown cells in terms of phospho-CDK2 (Tyr15) level, cells with LIMK1 knockdown showed higher
spho-Histone H3 levels than the control cells. This suggests that there is higher portion of mitotic but
G1 and S phase cells in the LIMK1 knockdown situation. Besides Western blot, we have conducted
S to investigate the DNA content of cells transfected with control and LIMK1 siRNA (Fig.2 and
plementary Fig. S4b, c). The control and LIMK1 knockdown cells showed similar DNA profile from 24
6 hours post siRNA transfection, suggesting that the LIMK1 knockdown cells can go through a few
nds of cell cycle and silencing of LIMK1 does not lead to obvious aneuploidy.
observations that cells with LIMK1 knockdown are capable of completing cytokinesis might be due to
sible redundant function of LIMK2 as LIMK2 is localized to the midzone microtubules during anaphase
elophase [1]. It is also possible that the activity of LIMK1 is not required for cytokinesis as LIMK1 is
erphosphorylated at the onset of M phase and gradually becomes inactivated during telophase and
kinesis [2, 3]. Although we observe multi-polar spindle in LIMK1 knockdown cells, these extra spindle
es may eventually coalescence/cluster to become bi-polar spindle before anaphase onset especially in
cer cells [4].
f LICs are LMK1 substrates that mediate LIMK1 function in centrosome integrity, and LIMK1
vity is required for centrosome integrity, how is it that overexpression of LICs can suppress the loss of
K1 activity? Wouldn’t they still need to be phosphorylated? I don’t know that the authors need to
ress this point experimentally, but should at least discuss how they reconcile the requirement for
se activity with the observation that simple overexpression of LICs can bypass the need for LIMK1
se activity.
ly: We proposed that LIMK1 phosphorylation of DYNC1LI1/2 (LIC1/2) is required for proper transport
ction of cytoplasmic dynein-1; yet when we overexpressed LIC1/2 constructs, we are able to rescue
LIMK1-knockdown phenotype. One possible explanation is that under the situation of
rexpression, LIMK2 or other kinases might be able to phosphorylate the abundant LICs. Cdc2 kinase
been reported to phosphorylate LIC and regulate dynein transport [6]. Alternatively, the residual
ount of the remaining LIMK1 is capable of phosphorylation a portion of the overexpressed LICs. We
e included the above in the Discussion section.

t seems that the authors could do a little more to test and/or refine their model. Specifically, their
del predicts the possibility that LIC1 and LIC2 themselves localize to centrosomes in a LIMK1-
endent manner. This is likely not the only possibility, but it seems that examining the centrosomal
umulation of LIC1 and LIC2 in LIMK1 depleted cells would allow them to refine the model of how
K1 modulates their function. The authors might also determine whether LICs can interact with the
version of LIMK1 to determine whether the interaction requires LIMK1 kinase activity.
ly: We have performed additional experiment and found that both LIC1/2 interact with LIMK1-WT
kinase dead LIMK1 (D460A). However, the interaction with the kinase dead LIMK1 appeared to be
strong. Please see supplementary Fig. S9b for interaction of wildtype or the kinase-dead mutant of
K1 with LICs.
are unable to observe localization of LIC1/2 as the commercial antibodies are not suitable for
uno-staining. We have tried to express fluorescent-tag LIC1/2 at near endogenous level. However,
/2 is present throughout the whole cell, no distinct localization of LIC1/2 is observed.
or concerns:
disagree with the characterization that LIMK1 co-localizes with Centrin 3 (pg 5 lines 50-51, Fig 1a).
arly this experiments shows LIMK1 to be at centrosomes, but it is clearly a PCM protein and not a
triole protein. It seems that a PCM marker would be more appropriate for Fig 1, but failing that I
ld suggest a wording other than co-localization for two proteins found at different centrosomal
tions.
ly: We have replaced with the following: “LIMK1 was observed to localize close to the centrioles
m prophase through to metaphase (Fig.1a).”
he authors’ description of the various phenotypes associated spindle multipolarity seems a bit off to
In particular, the description of phenotypes 3 and 4 seems to be something of a straw man argument,
do not seem to acknowledge the possibility of premature centriole separation - that is, that the total
ber of centrioles in a multipolar spindle could be four yet more than two poles might have at least one
triole. Perhaps this is what the authors mean when they talk about centriole “fragmentation,” but
triole fragmentation evokes the physical disintegration of centrioles rather than the premature
aration of centriole pairs. Indeed, from the images shown in Fig 2c it would appear to be the case that
pindles shown have just four centrioles, even when more than two poles contain centrioles.
rification around the presentation of this point would be helpful.
ly: We do acknowledge that there might be a scenario that there could be four spindle poles (PCM
) and that two poles might have at least one centriole and not a pair of centrioles. That is why in our
sification of phenotype 3 (multi-spindle poles and all poles contain centrioles - we did not discount
possibility of single centriole at the poles) and phenotype 4 (multi-spindle poles and centriole/s not
sent at all poles). Phenotypes 3 or 4 could arise from pre-mature centriole fragmentation and/or
mature duplication.
While it may be difficult to come up with a good control, it is important to note that there is no control
either total or relative protein levels in isolated centrosomes in Fig S3.
ly: We have quantified and used equal amount of cell lysates for centrosome isolation. Equal

iven that dynein function is microtubule dependent, the use of Nocodazole arrest to examine
ractions with LICs brings up some interesting questions. The data suggest that the LIMK1-LIC
ractions do not require microtubules, but either LIMK1 centrosomal localization or function in PCM
grity might be microtubule dependent. This is particularly interesting given the conclusion that LICs
downstream of LIMK1 in the regulation of centrosome integrity. At a minimum, the possibility that
seems worthy of some discussion.
ly: It has been reported that nanomolar concentrations of Nocodazole can block cells in mitosis
hout disassembling the microtubule network but reducing the microtubule dynamics [8, 9]. In our
eriments, we synchronized the cells at M phase using 50 nM of nocodazole. At this concentration,
odazole treatment leads to improper spindle structure and DNA alignment due to reduction in
rotubule growth and shortening velocities instead of depolymerizing the existing microtubule
work. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say that LIMK1-LIC interaction is or is not dependent on
rotubules. We have included this in the Discussion section, see Page 16 line 335-342.
he blots in Figure 7b should be better labeled. Specifically, it is difficult to determine which blots
e probed with which antibodies. One presumes the top panels were probed with anti-GST and the
om with anti-Flag, but that should be indicated on the figure for ease of interpretation.
ly: We have changed and labelled Fig 7b accordingly.

Appendix C
Response to Referees
Referee 1
1) We have taken the suggestion of Referee 1 and included the explanation in the previous
“response to referees” into the main text. We replace lines 311 to 314 in the previous
version by lines 313 to 321 in the revised version. See below the text we have included in
the revised version.
“The observations that cells with LIMK1 knockdown are capable of completing cytokinesis
might be due to possible redundant function of LIMK2 as LIMK2 is localized to the midzone
microtubules during anaphase to telophase [34]. It is also possible that the activity of LIMK1
is not required for cytokinesis as LIMK1 is hyperphosphorylated at the onset of M phase and
gradually becomes inactivated during telophase and cytokinesis [9, 10]. Although we
observe multi-polar spindle in LIMK1 knockdown cells, these extra spindle poles may
eventually coalescence/cluster to become bi-polar spindle before anaphase onset especially
in cancer cells [35].”
Heeding the suggestion of Referee 1, we have also removed LIMK2 in line 357.
2) We have included the full names of TubGCP2, NuMA etc. See lines 147 to 149.
3) L433: We have corrected the error, it should be 20 <U+F06D>M. See line 447.
4) Figure 7. We have explained the rationale of using HEK293 cells in the figure legend.
5) Figure 7 and Fig S9. We were asked to explain why two bands of LIC1 were observed in
Fig S9a. The most possible explanation is due to batch variation of the cells used. LIC1 was
phosphorylated at M-phase of the cell cycle due to increased levels of active LIMK1 when
the cells are arrested by nocodazole. The higher bands could be phosphorylated-LIC1. Some
non-phosphorylated LIC1 could still be present. That could be why we observed two bands
in Fig S9.
6) We have removed the redundancy in L323-L326. See L330 to L332 in revised version.
Referee 2
We showed that compared with cells transfected with LIMK-WT and active LIMK1, cells
transfected with kinase-dead LIMK1 resulted in changes in trafficking speed of PLK1, which
is a cargo of dynein (Fig S10). These observations suggest that the activity of LIMK1 is
important in regulating dynein motor transport. Although we observed faster trafficking
speed of PLK1 in kinase-dead LIMK1 overexrpessing cells at interphase, there was less PLK1
found at the mitotic centrosomes in LIMK1-knockdown cells. Referee 2 felt that these
observations were contradictory and wanted us to demonstrate that phosphorylation of
LICs by LIMK1 promotes or suppresses the interaction between LICs and centrosomal
proteins.
In order to provide an answer to Referee 2’s query, we performed co-immunoprecipitation
of LICs and PLK1 in active or kinase-dead LIMK1 co-transfected cells. Unfortunately, we were
not able to obtain conclusive results. However, we wish to argue that trafficking speed and
LIC-cargo interaction may not be related. We have observed that knocking down LIMK1
resulted in less accumulation of centrosomal proteins and this phenotype can be rescued by
active LIMK1 but not kinase-dead LIMK1 suggesting that LIMK1 activity is important for (a)
trafficking of centrosomal proteins, (b) loading of the centrosomal proteins to the
motor/LICs or (c) unloading of the cargoes when they reach the centrosomes. In this study,
we are not able to pin-point the roles of LIMK1 in these three possible situations. We have
included this in the Discussion, see line 353. Importantly, we have shown that LIMK1
regulates mitotic centrosome integrity through modulation of LICs.
