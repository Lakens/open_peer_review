Minor comments:
1. Introduction chapter. Typically ATG8-lipidation machinery is referred to as two ubiquitin-like
conjugation systems.
2. While mentioning the studies involving over-expression or silencing of individual ATG genes
authors do not dwell on the correlation between expression level of these genes and actual
activity of the pathway. It is especially misleading in the context of the previous chapter
mentioning transcriptional changes of endogenous genes under autophagy-inducing conditions.
3. It would be interesting to also know authors opinion on autophagy-proteasome interplay in
homeostasis.
4. The evidence for existence of microautophagy in plants is still questionable. For example,
conclusions in the doi: 10.1002/cbin.10512 cited in this review, are based on electron microscopy
that does not exclude the role of macroautophagy.

Comments to the Author

The present review manuscript shows the recent progress on understanding autophagy in crops
as well as other plant species and discuss potential future research directions. I think this topic
itself is timely and highly valuable for general readers of “Open Biology”. The authors have
covered much of the relevant literature. However, I think there are some problems with the
manuscript. The following are some of the critical comments.
(1) Figure 1: similar figures have already been published in many reviews and not new. Not
worth to be published repeatedly here in this review. No need to publish it here.
(2) Table 1: The authors found new ATG genes from some plant species by using the database
search, and these genes have been mentioned in Table 1. However, the readers can’t get the
information about these genes. The authors should mention the accession codes of these genes
and show the similarity data (e.g. Amino acids) compared with Arabidopsis ATGs.
(3) Table 2: It is hard to understand the relationships between “Related processes” and
“References” for general readers. The authors should accurately describe relevant processes and
corresponding citations.
(4) Figure 2: Title in figure 2 that “regulation of autophagy-----in crops” is too speculative and
NOT justified conclusively. The title should be revised in a more realistic manner based upon
current results (only in Tomato and Arabidopsis?).
(5) Title that “Autophagy in Crop Plants-What’s New Beyond Arabidopsis?” contains interesting
theme for general readers as well as plant autophagy researchers. However, the authors do not
provide clear explanation about this theme in all figures and tables. At present, it is hard to
understand “What’s New Beyond Arabidopsis?” from all figures and tables. Can the authors
propose a model/table about “What is new findings from the study of crops?” and “What is
consistent with the results of Arabidopsis?”

Comments to the Author(s)
Minor comments:
1. Introduction chapter. Typically ATG8-lipidation machinery is referred
to as two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems.
We reworded this part in the introduction (lines 46-48) and included
information on the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems.
2. While mentioning the studies involving over-expression or silencing
of individual ATG genes authors do not dwell on the correlation
between expression level of these genes and actual activity of the
pathway. It is especially misleading in the context of the previous
chapter mentioning transcriptional changes of endogenous genes
under autophagy-inducing conditions.
We rewrote some sentences to clarify the connection between
expression level of ATG genes and activity of pathways (autophagy or
other affected pathways) as well as how the activity is altered in these
plants under stress conditions (see lines 55-56, 224-227, 245-246,
300-302).
3. It would be interesting to also know authors opinion on autophagy-
proteasome interplay in homeostasis.
We agree that this is an interesting topic. However, to our knowledge
there is little information currently on this topic in crops, and therefore
we have chosen not to speculate until more research is available.
4. The evidence for existence of microautophagy in plants is still
questionable. For example, conclusions in the doi: 10.1002/cbin.10512
cited in this review, are based on electron microscopy that does not
exclude the role of macroautophagy.
We agree that microautophagy is still not well-studied in plants and
mention this point in the introduction. In addition, we included two more
examples (uptake of anthocyanin and damaged chloroplasts by the
vacuole) to support the existence of microautophagy (lines 25-27).

The present review manuscript shows the recent progress on
understanding autophagy in crops as well as other plant species and
discuss potential future research directions. I think this topic itself is
timely and highly valuable for general readers of “Open Biology”. The
authors have covered much of the relevant literature. However, I think
there are some problems with the manuscript. The following are some
of the critical comments.
(1) Figure 1: similar figures have already been published in many
reviews and not new. Not worth to be published repeatedly here in this
review. No need to publish it here.
We deleted this figure. Correspondingly, the figure numbers of the
other two figures were changed to figure 1 and figure 2 in the text and
figure legends.
(2) Table 1: The authors found new ATG genes from some plant
species by using the database search, and these genes have been
mentioned in Table 1. However, the readers can’t get the information
about these genes. The authors should mention the accession codes
of these genes and show the similarity data (e.g. Amino acids)
compared with Arabidopsis ATGs.
We created a table for the newly identified genes that includes the
accession numbers and similarity data compared to Arabidopsis ATGs
(Table 2).
(3) Table 2: It is hard to understand the relationships between “Related
processes” and “References” for general readers. The authors should
accurately describe relevant processes and corresponding citations.
We changed the layout of this table and added references directly to
the corresponding process. Note that this table is table 3 in the revised
version.
(4) Figure 2: Title in figure 2 that “regulation of autophagy-----in crops”
is too speculative and NOT justified conclusively. The title should be
revised in a more realistic manner based upon current results (only in
Tomato and Arabidopsis?).
We rewrote the title to “Identified regulators of autophagy during
drought and heat stress in tomato”. Note that this figure is figure 1 in
the revised version.
(5) Title that “Autophagy in Crop Plants-What’s New Beyond
Arabidopsis?” contains interesting theme for general readers as well as
plant autophagy researchers. However, the authors do not provide
clear explanation about this theme in all figures and tables. At present,
it is hard to understand “What’s New Beyond Arabidopsis?” from all
figures and tables. Can the authors propose a model/table about “What
is new findings from the study of crops?” and “What is consistent with
the results of Arabidopsis?”
We created Table 4 as a general summary of consistent findings and
new findings in crops compared to what has been found in
Arabidopsis.
