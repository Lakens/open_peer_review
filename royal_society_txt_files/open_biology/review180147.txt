In the manuscript “Suitability of hepatocyte cell lines HepG2, AML12 and THLE-2 for
investigation of insulin signalling and hepatokine gene expression” Sefried et al. aim to
investigate if AML12 and THLE-2 cells are comparable to HepG2 cells for studies of acute insulin
signalling and expression of gluconeogenic enzymes and hepatokines. Improved cellular models
that better reflect the human in vivo situation are needed; however, the data presented in this
manuscript are not that strong and reliable.
Major concerns:
1. When it comes to the experiments in HepG2 cells, the results are clear and in line with previous
research. However, withdrawal of insulin from the culturing media of AML12 and THLE-2 cells,
before stimulation with insulin, may affect the phenotype of the cells which has to be investigated
in detail.
2. The blots presented are of questionable quality, especially the one presented in Figure 3A. Also,
it is written that three replicates were used but only two replicates are presented. As four
different blots have been put together in the figures, and as gels commonly has at least 10 wells, it
is possible to apply all three samples for each treatment on the same gel. Moreover, if three
replicates were used, how come that Figure 3 only shows one protein band 48 h after stimulation
with 100 nM insulin?
3. Antibodies may have different affinity for different cells and species. How are these potential
differences controlled for in the experiments comparing IRS1, IRS2, and IR in all the three cell
lines? Are the conclusions correct?
4. A few genes involved in gluconeogenesis were analyzed but the conclusion drawn was that
AML12 and THLE-2 cells “show an impaired/lost ability to express gluconeogenic enzymes”.
Enzymatic activities need to be assessed.
5. In the Discussion the authors discuss that the PPARA and PPARG mRNA expression levels
were similar and comparable between the cell lines. How was this validated?
6. The conclusion “AML12 and THLE-2 can be recommended to study insulin signaling when
cells are cultured in insulin-deficient medium” is too strong and before analyses of the phenotype
of these cells after withdrawal of insulin it is incorrect. According to me, this study shows that
HepG2 cells are a much better option for studies of insulin signaling and expression of some
gluconeogenic genes and ANGPTL4.

Appendix A
Response to referee 1
Thank you for your comments and suggestions to improve our manuscript.
We would like to respond to all of your points.
1. When it comes to the experiments in HepG2 cells, the results are clear
and in line with previous research. However, withdrawal of insulin from the
culturing media of AML12 and THLE-2 cells, before stimulation with insulin,
may affect the phenotype of the cells which has to be investigated in detail.
We agree with the reviewer that withdrawal of insulin from the regular culture
medium for a longer period of time has the potential to induce changes in the
phenotype of AML12 and THLE-2 cells. However, we would like to point out
that the high insulin concentration in the recommended culture media from the
manufacturer apparently generates an insulin-resistant phenotype which is
characterized by reduced AKT phosphorylation upon acute insulin stimulation.
A phenotype that results from low insulin concentrations in the culture
medium resembles more the normal physiologic conditions. Therefore, we
sought to investigate if withdrawal of insulin induces an insulin-responsive
phenotype which is comparable to HepG2 cells, which are not cultured in the
presence of high insulin concentrations. Our data show how important it is to
consider the culture conditions if these cells are going to be used for studies
on insulin signaling. We added the notion of the insulin resistant phenotype of
the cells that is induced by the regular culture medium in lines 177-184 in the
discussion to make the reader aware.
2. The blots presented are of questionable quality, especially the one
presented in Figure 3A.
The Western Blot in Figure 3A is indeed not of the best quality. However,
quality of Western Blots was sufficient to enable quantification of band
intensities with the Image Studio Lite Software for quantification of insulin-
stimulated AKT phosphorylation as shown in the respective Figures.
Also, it is written that three replicates were used but only two replicates are
presented.
Each experiment was performed three times as biological replicate with two
technical replicates within each biological replicate. The two bands visible for
each experimental condition in Figures 1-3 are technical replicates of one out
of three biological replicates.
As four different blots have been put together in the figures, and as gels
commonly has at least 10 wells, it is possible to apply all three samples for
each treatment on the same gel.
We chose to load all samples from one cell line from one experiment on the
same gel, to be able to compare band intensities for the different experimental
conditions in one cell line within one Western Blot. Since we have in total 5-6
samples for each treatment (see below) it was not possible to load all samples
on the same gel.
Moreover, if three replicates were used, how come that Figure 3 only shows
one protein band 48 h after stimulation with 100 nM insulin?
Only in Figure 3A/B for experimental condition “cultivation without insulin for
48 hours and acute stimulation with 100 nM insulin” one sample was loaded
onto SDS gel in the presented Western Blots. We indicated this in the figure
legends. The other technical replicate unfortunately got lost during sample
preparation.
3. Antibodies may have different affinity for different cells and species.
How are these potential differences controlled for in the experiments
comparing IRS1, IRS2, and IR in all the three cell lines? Are the conclusions
correct?
Antibody affinities might differ for different cells and species. The best
approach to control for this possibility would require a quantitative proteomics
analyses. Posttranslational modifications mainly account for potential
differences in antibody affinity. However, the standardized cell culture
conditions we used in our experiments likely induced comparable
posttranslational modifications in the investigated proteins from the different
cell lines, thus allowing us to compare antibody signals. To reduce variability,
we loaded samples on one gel to be able to compare antibody signals from
one gel from the different cell lines. In addition, GAPDH was detected from
the same Western Blot membrane to visualize GAPDH content in all used cell
lines. For GAPDH, band intensities were similar between the cell lines and
this showed us that GAPDH expression is a useful loading and expression
control. Thus, band intensity of GAPDH expression was used to normalize the
signal intensities from IRS1, IRS2 and IR. The normalized values are shown
in Figure 5 B-C and these results were used to draw the conclusions
regarding differential expression of IRS1, IRS2 and IR in the used cell lines
presented in the manuscript.
4. A few genes involved in gluconeogenesis were analyzed but the
conclusion drawn was that AML12 and THLE-2 cells “show an impaired/lost
ability to express gluconeogenic enzymes”. Enzymatic activities need to be
assessed.
We completely agree that measuring secretion of labelled glucose in the
supernatant by using labelled gluconeogenic precursors would be the best
way to evaluate gluconeogenesis. However, the very low or non-detectable
mRNA levels of G6PC and PCK1 in AML12 and THLE-2 cells and the lack of
forskolin-responsiveness are a good hint that both cell lines are not
recommendable to study gluconeogenesis. We reported these limitations in
the results section (line 139-145) and the discussion (line 211-213 and 239-
241).
5. In the Discussion the authors discuss that the PPARA and PPARG
mRNA expression levels were similar and comparable between the cell lines.
How was this validated?
PPARA and PPARG mRNA expression levels were quantified by RT-PCR.
This method allows relative quantification of a target by calculating the ratio
between the amount of target and the amount of a housekeeping gene. In the
described experiments TBP (TATA-box binding protein) was used as
housekeeping gene. PPARA, PPARG and TBP were amplified from the same
sample. PPARA and PPARG values were normalized to TBP and the
normalized value was used to compare expression in different samples. Both
targets showed a normalized value of approximately 1 in all analyzed
samples. This indicates that PPARA and PPARG were expressed in a similar
and comparable amount in the used cell lines.
6. The conclusion “AML12 and THLE-2 can be recommended to study
insulin signaling when cells are cultured in insulin-deficient medium” is too
strong and before analyses of the phenotype of these cells after withdrawal of
insulin it is incorrect. According to me, this study shows that HepG2 cells are
a much better option for studies of insulin signaling and expression of some
gluconeogenic genes and ANGPTL4.
According to our data AML12 and THLE-2 cells can be used to study insulin
signaling. However, results should be interpreted with caution and certain
aspects need to be considered. These aspects are the presence of high
amounts of insulin in the cell culture medium that is recommended by the
manufacturer as well as the different expression levels of the insulin receptor
and its substrates. We therefore also concluded in the discussion that AML12
and THLE-2 cells are not superior to HepG2 cells when insulin signaling is
studied. This statement however does not exactly match the last paragraph in
the abstract. We therefore modified this paragraph to be more precise (line
42/43).
Response to referee 2
Thank you for your comments and suggestions to improve our manuscript.
We would like to respond to all of your points.
1. On section 4 Material & methods: line 4.4 Cell Lysis section amount of total
protein loaded in gel need to be added.
We thank reviewer 2 for careful reading of the manuscript. We added the
requested information in the Material and Methods section in line 293.
2. On section 4.5 RNA extraction, line 307-308 standard concentrations
ranged from 0.5 ag/ul -5 ng/ul needs to correct. is ag/ul mistype?
We are sorry that we mixed up the concentration range, stating in the
manuscript a standard concentration from 0.5 ag/µl – 5 ng/µl. The
concentration range of the RT-PCR standard ranged from 0.5 ng/µl to 5 ag/µl.
Standards were freshly diluted on the day of the experiment from a 5 ng/µl
stock solution. A 1:10 dilution was prepared from the stock solution and
designated standard 1, equaling 0.5 ng/ml. From this standard serial 1:10
dilutions were made until 1:1000 000 000, what corresponds to 5 ag/µl. We
corrected the details in line 314.
3. Figure 3 A image of western blot bands for pThr-308 AKT not so clear. Do
you have another example of this protein expression? It would be good to
replace it.
Reviewer 1 also mentioned Western Blot in Figure 3A of pThr-308 AKT not to
have the best quality. We agree with you and reviewer 1. However, quality of
Western Blots was sufficient to enable quantification of band intensities with
the Image Studio Lite Software for quantification of insulin-stimulated AKT
phosphorylation as shown in the respective Figures.
Appendix B
Response to Reviewer 1
The quality of the Western blot in Figure 3A has to be repeated before this
manuscript can be accepted.
In Figure 1 in this Response Letter we present the original Western Blot as it
is currently in the manuscript (A) and a novel Western Blot (B) using samples
already part of Figure 1A. We increased the amount of loaded protein to 30
µg to increase signal intensity. The loading scheme of the novel Western Blot
follows the order of the densitometric analysis (C).
It is clearly visible that phosphorylation of Thr-308 increases when cells were
cultivated without insulin for 24 or 48 hours. The phosphorylation of Thr-308 is
well in accordance with phosphorylation of Ser-473, which is already
presented in the manuscript.
Since the loading scheme of the representative Western Blot doesn’t follow
the loading scheme of the other presented Blots in the manuscript we decided
to present the Blot in this Response Letter and did not integrate it yet into the
manuscript.
We hope that the quality of the representative Western Blot is convincing
Reviewer 1 to allow publication of our manuscript in Open Biology.
