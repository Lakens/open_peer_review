Lamb et al.
Implications of dimeric activation of PDE6 for rod Phototransduction

Comments to the Authors
This is an important paper that provides detailed functional interpretation of experimental
findings reported in the accompanying paper RSOB-18-0075 by Quereshi et al. It may fill a gap
that seriously affects our understanding of molecular details of activation of a paradigmatic
GPCR-signaling cascade. It is well done and well written.
However, I have a few minor comments, and two major concerns considering the presented MS,
as explained below.
Minor comments:
1. As a possible source of the continuous dark noise, the authors consider spontaneous activation
of G. However, Rieke & Baylor 1996 (ref. [31] in the MS) show that the continuous noise remains
unchanged when the truncated ROS is dialyzed with 0 GTP solution. What then could be the
source of G*? I guess there is no answer to this question, but the problem should be mentioned in
the MS.
2. Authors do not ascribe any functional role to the structural asymmetry of rod PDE6. Then why
symmetrical cone PDE6 should/could behave in a different way?
3. Authors demonstrate that the necessity of binding two G* by PDE6 for its activation
(coincidence switch) provides immunity against noise generated by random activation of the PDE
that is triggered by spontaneous thermal activation of G*. Sparse G*s generated in darkness
cannot activate PDE while high local concentration of G* created by single R* allows binding of
two G* to the same PDE, thus activating cGMP hydrolysis. This is quite convincing, but the
central point looks a bit shaky. There is no demonstration, either experimental or computational,
that the problem really exists. That is, that there is (would be) the noise to fight in the routine
model of independent activation. Experimentally, it is shown that the noise persists in the ROS
dialyzed with 0 GTP when no G activation is expected (ref. [31] in the MS), that is, the noise is G*-
independent. This issue cannot be resolved at present, I guess. Yet computationally, the present
MS clearly shows that real noise observed in mammalian rods is only compatible with the rate of
PDE* production <= 50 per ROS per second (in the coincidence scenario) resulting in the rate of
G* production of ˜ 4500 s-1 (pages 21-22). Authors compare this estimate with a sole source of
experimental data [30]. Yet there is a big scatter in estimates of the rate of dark activation of G
(10-5 to 10-3 s-1, reviewed in Melia et al., 1997. Biophys. J. 73, 3182 – 3191). It would be good to
discuss the problem.
4. Authors suggest that the independent activation of subunits of cone PDE would account for the
much higher level of continuous noise in cones. However, as far as I aware, there is no evidence
that the continuous noise in cones originates from spontaneous activation of G, either. If authors
have any argument in favor of this, it would be good to discuss it. If not, we can leave the
problem pending, as in case of rods. Nevertheless, authors reproduced rod noise in the
coincidence activation scenario. Then it would be easy to repeat the computations in the
independent activation scenario and compare it with the cone noise. I understand that repeating
the computations of noise for cone single-T*PDE* response may be time-consuming, so this is just
a suggestion.
5. Authors suggest that the specifics of cone PDE6 activation, resulting in high dark noise, would
explain why single-photon events are unresolvable in cones. I suppose that there is quite obvious
alternative – and parsimonious - explanation. Single-photon events in cones are at least two
orders of magnitude smaller than rod SPRs, so they would sink even in the rod noise. An
additional factor could be higher frequency of SPRs in cones resulting in their overlap.
6. Authors suggest that the independent activation of subunits of cone PDE6 could increase the
amplification constant. However, it is established that the amplification constant in cones is
usually few times lower than in rods, and only in “best” cells it may be as high as in rods
4
(Koshitani et al., 2014. J. Biol. Chem. 289:2651-7; Astakhova et al., 2015. Molecular Vision 21: 244-
263). So there is no problem to solve.
7. Comparing their conclusions on the origin and properties of the dark noise with those by Rieke
& Baylor 1996, the authors are troubled by two orders of magnitude difference of the numbers of
PDE* subunits at the peak of the SPR between their and R&B computations. I do not see any
problem here. Firstly, R&B dealt with toad rods whose volume is apr. 40 times larger than in
mouse. Secondly, R&B assumed far lower catalytic activity of the PDE subunit compared with the
modern estimate used in the present MS.
8. The movie (Supplement 1) runs on my PC (which is not particularly fast) in ca. 1 second, so it is
impossible to trace the process. Is it possible to make it slower?
Major concerns:
My major concerns are related to two (of three) central conclusions of the paper.
1. The authors state that their results resolve long-standing controversy between two
experimental estimates of the rate of activation of the phototransduction cascade. They believe
that the rate of 1000 s-1 obtained by light-scattering measurements reflect transducing binding to
rhodopsin, while much lower value, ca. 200 s-1, reflect the rate of activation of PDE6 by double
binding of G*. However, the rate 120 – 150 s-1 (rather than 1000 s-1) was obtained exactly by
measuring GTPgS binding by G (rather than by PDE) (Ref. [21] in the MS). This problem is not
resolved and even not mentioned in the MS.
2. Authors say that they solved the paradox recently noticed by Rotov et al. (ref. [7] in the MS),
namely that the photoresponse delay in cones is substantially shorter than in rods. However,
their reasoning is inconsistent. Firstly, authors assume that the activation of G by R* occurs at the
rate of 1000 s-1. However, the frequency of diffusional collisions between R* and Gs is almost 20
times higher (Pugh & Lamb, 1993, BBA 1141, 111-149). Thus, the probability of productive
collisions for R* and G is ˜1/20. On the other hand, G*-PDE activation is supposed to occur at the
diffusion limit, hence the probability of productive encounters = 1. But this is exactly the paradox
mentioned by Rotov et al. They ask how it is made possible that the interaction between G* and
PDE* in cones is substantially faster than between R* and G, in spite of lower surface packing
density of PDE. The answer offered in the MS is essentially “by definition” which is hardly
satisfactory.
In addition, activation at the diffusion limit implies that two molecules interact instantaneously
independently of their mutual orientation at the moment of collision. For me, this does not look
feasible, especially because it does not work this way for R* and G.
I consider my comments a minor revision because they may need minimum computations and do
not request any further experimentation. Yet I believe that the reasoning in the MS must be more
elaborated.

pendix A
is a fantastic paper, a real tour de force. I regard it as a milestone in the field of
totransduction. The paper explores in a very detailed and comprehensive manner the
lications of the dimeric activation of PDE6 in rod phototransduction—the topic of the first
wo back-to-back papers. The full gamut of rod response properties is covered, from the
le-photon response to the recovery of responses from super-saturating flashes. The paper is
l written and well organized. It reads very well. The stochastic simulations, including 2-D
usion on the surface of disk membranes and lateral diffusion along the length of the rod, are
y impressive. I expect the paper to be of high impact in a number of different fields. A minor
plaint is that the topic of reproducibility of the single-photon response (SPR) is discussed a
gliby. This is OK as long as the authors add bit to Discussion about what needs to be done to
ermine whether their model passes muster with regard to explaining the long-standing
tery of the regularity of the SPR. It is not incumbent upon the authors to solve all problems
he field of phototransduction at once. The paper is very thoughtful and scholarly overall, but
references are a bit selective, in a way that is entirely unsurprising in the field of
totransduction with its unique culture and history.
comments and suggestions, all minor, are listed below.
n p. 10, section 3.1, the 68 G*s produced rather larger than the number that has come to
accepted in the literature in recent years. I never believed the lower numbers, so I’m not
uting this number. Previous reasoning was in the context of the incorrect idea that the 2
subunit are independent and equal. This issue of the rate of G*activation is addressed in
y nicely and thoroughly later section 3.2 and in Discussion. Maybe refer to this here?
ater on the same page, the statement, “the time-course of PDE** activity rises as a ramp
t has been delayed by a first-order time constant” is unclear, because it doesn’t make sense
terpreted literally. I’m not quite sure what the authors mean. Is the idea that the waveform
ks like it results from the convolution of a ramp function with an exponential kernel?
Accounting for the delay in the onset of the response is fantastic.
n p. 11, section 3.2, it would be good to be more explicit about the downstream reactions
t account for the 23 ms difference between peak PDE** activity and the peak photocurrent.
Also in section 3.2, the CV value of 0.45 for the peak amplitude of the photocurrent is
stantially higher than reported values. On a related note, I’m sure that the authors are well
re of the virtues of measuring the CV of the area under the SPR as a means of testing
dels. Many papers, starting with those of Rieke have covered this ground. The CV of SPR
a is an important missing piece of information. It seems that the required double binding of
to PDE doesn’t contribute to the regularity of the SPR, or does it? I don’t expect the model in
present paper to be able to account for the reproducibility of the SPR as measured by
area). No model in the literature does so once the stochastic small integer nature of PDE* or
** is taken into account. It seems that something is still missing. Perhaps comment on this
iscussion.
he weak dependence of the activation of PDE** on the density of the holomer PDE6 is quite
resting. Doesn’t this help explain puzzling results in the literature in experiments in which
6 expression has been manipulated in various ways and the effect on the SPR have been
asured? Isn’t this an important item for discussion?
is not clear what is new in section 3.5 on the power spectrum of the noise resulting from
ntaneous activation of PDE**. Right now, this section seems to be a bit of a diversion.
haps it could be justified at the beginning of the section. In any case, this section seems
er longer than it needs to be.
n section 2.3, the modeling of the longitudinal diffusion of cGMP and Ca2+ is mentioned, but
reader can easily lose sight of this in much of the body of the paper. For example, the
ase “coupling to downstream reactions” doesn’t seem to quite capture what is really done.
ems more appropriate for a single-compartment model.
n p. 20, first paragraph, the discussion of CV(amplitude) and its relationship to the
hastic integer number of molecules activated is fast and loose and theoretically incorrect.
is a much more complicated issue than the authors lead a naïve reader to believe. Kinetics
a very important role, and there is no straightforward relationship between CV(amplitude)
the number and lifetime of activated R* and PDE**. Perhaps it would be better to just
e this paragraph out.
I like the computations on Tsat and the related discussion. I agree that it is likely that the
ond longer dominant time constant, which the present model does not capture, is a
ection of the fact that the decay of unbound G* at high intensities is currently not taken into
ount.
I think it would be a good idea to distinguish this work from the raft of papers by Bisegna,
uso and colleagues who also did spatiotemporal stochastic modeling of rod
totransduction. They didn’t take into account the integer nature of G*, and this is a huge
.

Responses to Reviewers
Reviewer 1
Very many thanks for such a highly positive review and for the helpful suggestions.
First para: We have now added consideration of the variability/reproducibility of SPRs,
including as a test for the model (a new paragraph in §3.2, as well as a new section §4.5
in the Discussion).
1. Agreed; sentence added on p. 10.
2. Reworded as suggested.
3. Thank you.
4. Agreed. We have added a sentence to this paragraph to explain delay in downstream
reactions. In addition, and to address Point 8, we have explicitly listed the full set of
equations for the downstream reactions in the Supplementary Material.
5. Agreed; we have added a new paragraph in §3.2 about CV(Area), citing previous papers on
this.
6. We have not been able to locate work in the literature where the expression level of PDE has
been altered. So instead we have added a sentence to §4.4 in the Discussion, predicting
the outcome of such experiments.
7. We have added a sentence at the start, justifying our investigation of noise spectra.
8. Agreed. We have rewritten the material in §2.3 to provide more detail on the use of
longitudinal diffusion in the downstream reactions, and as mentioned under Point 4
above we have explicitly presented the full set of equations in Supplementary Material.
9. Agreed; we have removed the offending paragraph in §3.2.
10. Thank you.
11. Rather than explicitly criticising those other studies, we prefer to leave it to history.
Reviewer 2
Thank you very much for the positive review and the helpful suggestions.
1. (and also 3.) We have revised the paragraph at the start of §4.7 referring to the experiments
of Rieke & Baylor (1996). If similar results were to be obtained in mammalian rods,
then there would indeed be a problem with attributing the source to spontaneous
activation of G*.
2. We feel that proper consideration of the cone PDE6 is beyond the scope of our analysis of
the rod PDE6, and will require further work. Instead, in §4.10, we provide a brief
overview of what may occur in cones.
3. (a) The reviewer suggests predicting what the rod noise would be in the case of independent
activation of PDE subunits. But this is what has been done in previous studies (such as
that of Rieke & Baylor, 1996, to which the reviewer refers). The reviewer comments
that the issue cannot be resolved at present, as to whether independent activation would
produce high enough noise, and we agree, and therefore we feel it would not be
worthwhile going any further down that avenue at present.
(b) We hesitate to follow the reviewer’s suggestion of citing the two additional references on
spontaneous nucleotide binding by G-protein, cited by Melia et al (1997). Although
Fawzi & Northup (1990) mention a value of 0.001 s-1, we cannot see that this was
accurately determined in their study. And Matesic & Liebman (1992) is an Abstract that
we have not found reported in full.
4. We agree with the reviewer that for cones there is little evidence regarding the molecular
origin of the continuous noise. Given that we mention cones only in passing in this
paper, we feel it would be a diversion to speculate about such mechanisms. And in order
to simulate the continuous noise that would be elicited in cones by spontaneous
activation of G* we would need to develop a complete set of parameters for cones,
comparable to those in Tables 1 and 2, and then re-do the simulations. That would be far
beyond the scope of the present paper.
5. Agreed; we replaced this sentence.
6. We agree with the reviewer that the amplification constant in the “best” cones is as high as in
rods (and indeed probably higher), but we do not accept that it has been established that
in general the cone amplification constant is lower (e.g. see Pugh & Lamb, 1993). But,
again, this is really a topic for a future study of cones, and we only mention the issue in
passing in this paper.
7. See response to 1. above; we have reworded the comparison with Rieke & Baylor’s report.
8. The movie was not in this paper, but was instead in the companion paper.
Major 1. We now explicitly address the discrepancy between estimates of transducin activation
rates, for which high values have been obtained with light scattering experiments (and
which are needed here) and for which low values have been obtained in biochemical
experiments on incorporation of GTP<U+03B3>S. Thus, we have added a new paragraph at the
end of §4.3. Also, we have corrected a wrong citation: Heck & Hofmann (1993) should
have been (2001). In addition, in the second para of §4.3, we have cited earlier
experiments estimating the rate from light scattering measurements.
Major 2. We now explicitly address the issue referred to in Ref. [7], regarding the role of
diffusional interactions in determining the rates of G* and PDE* activation, in a new
paragraph at the end of §4.2. For the interaction of R* with G, the relative slowness
results from the time taken for the microsteps in the catalysis reaction, whereas for the
interaction of G* with PDE the two molecules simply need to bind.
Summary
In summary, we have added further explanatory text to the paper, in order to discuss more fully
the variability of the single-photon response (as requested by Reviewer 1) and to elaborate our
reasoning (as requested by Reviewer 2). In doing so, we have added a new final Section
‘Consequences’ and also the downstream reaction equations in Supplementary Material.
