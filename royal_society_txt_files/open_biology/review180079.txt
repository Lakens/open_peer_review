It is apparent from past studies of the authors and others that certain protein disulphide bonds on
the lymphocyte surface are cleaved upon cell activation. It is also becoming clear that this
chemical event regulates key immune cell functions. This study has measured the level and
kinetics of this modification for the first time. The authors show that certain proteins involved in
activation and adhesion of lymphocytes contain disulphides that are significantly cleaved and
that this cleavage is transitory.
Major Comments
1. Do the authors know which particular disulphides and being cleaved in the surface proteins?
This information would significantly enhance the value of the study. The logical next step is to
explore the functional consequences of the disulphide cleavage and this will start with the
identity of the labile disulphide bond.
2. Thioredoxin has been implicated as the disulphide reductant. Are the authors certain that PX-
12 does not inhibitor other oxidoreductases secreted by lymphocytes, such as PDI, ERp5, ERp57.
3. Is the transient nature of the disulphide reduction due to oxidation of the bond or turnover of
the protein?
Minor Comments
1. The terms labile and allosteric are used interchangeably in the manuscript to describe the
modified disulphide bonds. I suggest that ‘labile’ be used for disulphides whose cleavage does
not mediate, or is not known to mediate, a functional change in the protein (eg, ICAM1).
‘Allosteric’ is used when cleavage of the disulphide is known to change the function of the
protein in which the bond resides (eg, CD44).
2. In figure 7, there does not appear to be a difference in MLR with or without PX-12? In figure
7A, biological duplicates are shown as individual lines, and no statistical analysis was performed.
Figure 7B shows the percentage of cells bearing activation marker CD69, though a legend for this
figure is lacking.
3. On page 15, line 316, a space is missing between ‘MLR’ and ‘and’.
4. On page 16, line 331, ‘a AFC’ should be ‘an AFC’. On line 335, the full stop between ‘(Figure8
B)’ and ‘[15]’ should be removed, and a double space should be removed before ‘For instance’.
On line 337, the space after ‘semaphroin-4D’ should be removed.
5. On page 17, line 348, ‘if’ should be ‘it’. On line 353, a space is missing after ‘[33]’. The sentence
starting at line 360 with ‘The reduction’, and ending at line 362 needs to be rewritten.
6. Figure 4 is too small to be legible.

The authors have addressed my questions in the revision. There are a few outstanding minor
issues.
Minor Comments
1. Line 319: Trx1-mediated?
2. The extracellular domain of CD3 delta contains a single disulfide bond (Cys37-Cys73). This
could be the bond that is being cleaved.
3. Line 66: However, it is becoming increasingly clear that some disulfide bonds can be post-
translationally cleaved in a reducing redox environment by thiol oxidoreductase enzymes [6]. A
‘reducing redox environment’ is overstating the current evidence. This phrase could be deleted.
4. Lines 67-70: Suggest the following change this sentence. These labile disulfide bonds are either
catalytic (found at the active site of cysteine thiol reductase and thiol isomerase enzymes) or
allosteric (found in protein motifs that when reduced mediate an allosteric change in the protein
structure modulating protein function).

Dear Editor,
Thank you for considering our manuscript entitled “Reduction of leukocyte cell
surface disulfide bonds during immune activation is dynamic as revealed by a quantitative
proteomics workflow (SH-IQ)” for publication in Open Biology. Our response to the
reviewer’s concerns are detailed in bold below.
Referee 1
Overall, this manuscript reports a novel thiol identification and quantitative assessment (SH-IQ)
of labile disulfide bonds on the cell surface of T cells, using a model system (T cell line with a
chemical reductant TCEP) and confirms these results in a physiologic setting of a mixed
lymphocyte reaction. The labile disulfide bonds in the proteins identified have the potential to
regulate broad cellular functions.
Major suggestions:
1) The experiment supporting that thioredoxin is the physiologic reductant is not conclusive.
Only one inhibitor is used. Is this inhibitor specific for thioredoxin (Trx1)? Does it affect the
activity of other thioredoxin family reductases with CXXC motifs? Inhibitors often are not
specific for a particular family member and have other toxicities or off-target effects. To support
the claims made by the authors in the abstract, results and discussion, additional experiments
should be performed to more conclusively demonstrate the thioredoxin-1-dependent modulation
of cell surface disulfide bonds, e.g. knockdown of thioredoxin-1 in T cells. Alternatively, the
interpretations and emphasis could be re-worded.
Although PX-12 was developed as and has been reported as being specific for thioredoxin,
the similarity of the active sites of the other enzymes mentioned cannot guarantee its
specificity. Therefore, we have changed the emphasis of the results to thiol oxidoreductase
dependent and discussed this issue on page 18 along with the addition of reference 39.
2) Supplemental Figure 2: There is not enough information regarding this figure showing a
change in cell populations on FSC vs SSC plots over time with/without the thioredoxin inhibitor
to support the interpretation of a change in myeloid cell adhesion. Specific markers are needed
to identify myeloid cells. How is a change in adhesion supported over other possible differences
such as cell proliferation or cell death to account for the change in cell populations? Adhesion
could be directly tested. Additional experiments are needed to support the conclusion. Since this
figure is not essential to the conclusions of the paper, the supplemental figure and related
text could simply be removed.
The figure and text have been removed as suggested.
Minor suggestions:
1) It would be helpful to add information and discussion about the labile disulfides in CD3 that
were identified in relation to the published literature. Are the labile disulfides part of the
conserved CXXC motif in the membrane proximal stalk of CD3 epsilon, delta and gamma, which
have been demonstrated to be important in TCR signaling?
We have added information on this to the discussion along with reference 45, however we
did not identify the actual labile disulfides in CD3.
2) In the introduction the authors contrast conserved disulfide bonds vs. labile disulfide bonds.
Could you please clarify the distinction? Conserved disulfide bonds are necessary for maintaining
structure, so reduction of conserved disulfide bonds would significantly disrupt the structure.
Labile or allosteric disulfide bonds are susceptible to enzymatic or chemical reduction and can
have a functional change. Is that to say that conserved disulfide bonds are not susceptible to
enzymatic or chemical reduction?
Conserved disulfides can indeed be labile and we have rewritten this part of the
introduction to make this clearer.
3) Page 14 line 274 should state Supplementary Table 5 not Table 1.
This has been corrected.
4) It would be helpful to increase the resolution of Figure 4 and user darker colors, as it is difficult
to see the light gray, blue and red compared with black portions.
This has been corrected.
5) I would suggest combining Figure 5 and 6, as they are part of the same experiment.
This has been corrected.
6) The manuscript mostly uses the spelling disulfide, but also uses disulphide. Please consistently
use one spelling.
This has been corrected.
7) Page 17 line 348: “if” should be “it”
This has been corrected.
8) Is there a way to use color or a wider range of grey scale to illustrate the differences in the
CD44 peptide ion intensity map in Figure 3, as this is difficult to appreciate in the current figure.
We cannot change this as it is the output of the software we used.

Comments to the Author(s)
It is apparent from past studies of the authors and others that certain protein disulphide bonds on
the lymphocyte surface are cleaved upon cell activation. It is also becoming clear that this
chemical event regulates key immune cell functions. This study has measured the level and
kinetics of this modification for the first time. The authors show that certain proteins involved in
activation and adhesion of lymphocytes contain disulphides that are significantly cleaved and
that this cleavage is transitory.
Major Comments
1. Do the authors know which particular disulphides and being cleaved in the surface
proteins? This information would significantly enhance the value of the study. The logical next
step is to explore the functional consequences of the disulphide cleavage and this will start with
the identity of the labile disulphide bond.
In this particular mass spectrometry workflow the actual disulfide bonds which are
reduced are not revealed. There are far fewer biotinylated cysteine peptides originating
from labile disulfide bonds than there are other peptides and due to probability they are
generally not sequenced in the mass spec runs without further enrichment. In order to
sequence these peptides they need to be purified as we did previously (Metcalfe et.al. Open
Biology 2011) but when we tried to incorporate this into SH-IQ we found that it interfered
with the protein quantitation. So SH-IQ quantifies proteins in a mixture that contain labile
disulfide bonds but in order to identify the bonds the separate workflow we developed
previously would need to be used.
2. Thioredoxin has been implicated as the disulphide reductant. Are the authors certain that
PX-12 does not inhibitor other oxidoreductases secreted by lymphocytes, such as PDI, ERp5,
ERp57.
Please see response to referee 1.
3. Is the transient nature of the disulphide reduction due to oxidation of the bond or turnover
of the protein?
The experiments in this study do not reveal the answer to this and to answer this question
would be entire study in itself and beyond the scope of this paper. However, we have added
discussion of these two possible mechanisms of transience to page 19.
Minor Comments
1. The terms labile and allosteric are used interchangeably in the manuscript to describe the
modified disulphide bonds. I suggest that ‘labile’ be used for disulphides whose cleavage does
not mediate, or is not known to mediate, a functional change in the protein (eg, ICAM1).
‘Allosteric’ is used when cleavage of the disulphide is known to change the function of the
protein in which the bond resides (eg, CD44).
This has been corrected.
2. In figure 7, there does not appear to be a difference in MLR with or without PX-12? In
figure 7A, biological duplicates are shown as individual lines, and no statistical analysis was
performed. Figure 7B shows the percentage of cells bearing activation marker CD69, though a
legend for this figure is lacking.
Due to the way we conducted the experiment in figure 7A, (i.e. we mixed cells from two
donors to set up an MLR, split this into two and treated one sample with PX-12 and left the
other as a control) we felt that showing the data as separate experiments of PX-12 inhibited
reduction vs its control gave a better representation of what was happening. This is due to
the fact that the level of cell surface reduction differs greatly between different MLRs.
MLR 1 shows a high level of reduction after 96 hours but also some reduction in the
presence of the inhibitor. MLR 2 shows less reduction in both the control and inhibited
samples. We felt this was a more real example of what was going on rather than for example
calculating a fluorescence change relative to the control for each donor and combining the
data.
Figure 7B highlights that the Trx inhibitor PX-12 does not interfere with T cell activation
as followed by CD69 expression, which is why there is little difference in the two samples.
The figure legend has been corrected.
3. On page 15, line 316, a space is missing between ‘MLR’ and ‘and’.
This has been corrected.
4. On page 16, line 331, ‘a AFC’ should be ‘an AFC’. On line 335, the full stop between
‘(Figure8 B)’ and ‘[15]’ should be removed, and a double space should be removed before ‘For
instance’. On line 337, the space after ‘semaphroin-4D’ should be removed.
This has been corrected.
5. On page 17, line 348, ‘if’ should be ‘it’. On line 353, a space is missing after ‘[33]’. The
sentence starting at line 360 with ‘The reduction’, and ending at line 362 needs to be rewritten.
This has been corrected.
6. Figure 4 is too small to be legible.
This has been corrected.
We hope that the revised document and figures satisfy the concerns of yourself and the referees,
