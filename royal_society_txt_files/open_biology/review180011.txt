The authors analyzed the FANTOM5 CAGE datasets which determined an array of time-course
gene expression across cell types and different stimuli and studied the regulation of the
immediate-early genes (IEGs). A robust set (the early peak-patterns of their time-course gene
expression are conserved in at least seven out of total eight datasets) and permissive set
(conserved in at least four out of total eight datasets) of IEGs were first identified. Interestingly,
the hierarchical clustering of the peak expression time of the permissive IEGs well recapitulates
the well-known relationships between cell types. The relative promoter activation orderings of
the robust IEGs were then analyzed. By connecting the precedent and following genes, the results
suggest a comprehensive gene network of the robust IEGs. Further, the authors performed a
pathway analysis (InnateDB) and the most part of their predicted gene network was consistent
with InnateDB. Moreover, a substantial set of novel IEG regulation relationships was inferred
from the temporal activation ordering analysis. Owing to the superiority of the FANTOM5 CAGE
data in detecting ncRNAs and the alternative promoter usage, the authors further analyzed a
novel set of immediate-early response (IER) ncRNAs and suggested their possible function.
Comments:
This study was well performed and the most analyses were reasonable. Moreover, quantities of
the interesting inferences illustrating the IEG regulation were drawn from the results. However,
there remain several questions to be answered. A re-organization of the whole manuscript is
strongly recommended for being published as a concise and clear paper, that can be easily read
and understood by the readers.
— The relationship between the IER ncRNAs and their downstream genes is unclear. How do the
IER ncRNAs regulate the downstream genes? Please explain the potential mechanisms through
further analysis of the regulatory mechanism of the IER ncRNAs.
— The result of IEG analysis suggests that a large number (8,785) of IEGs show the IER peak in at
least one dataset, whereas only 42 IEGs are consistent in at least seven datasets. The readers
would be interested about why the most IEGs happen in the specific cell type or under the
specific stimulus. For example, the permissive IEGs which are excluded from the robust set of
IEGs. The authors may take several permissive IEGs as an example to illustrate the cell type- or
stimulus-specific IEGs.
— The current manuscript is confused due to not well-organized style and could set obstacles in
reading. For example:
— The first paragraph in pg. 10 is very confusing. It would be better to integrate this paragraph
within the ncRNA section.
— Discussion section almost repeats the context within the last section of Results. It would be
better to rephrase these two parts and make only one section.
— In Materials and methods, there is no subtitle for every section. The subtitle would be helpful
to clear whole view of this study.
— The presenting style of the figures in the current manuscript is confusing. For example:
— The idea that the authors want to present in Fig. 4 is very difficult to interpret.
— The scatter plots in Fig. 6 illustrate the temporal ordering of the robust IEGs. As a result, it
would be better to integrate the Fig. 6 scatterplots with Fig. 7. Moreover, the authors mentioned
the dynamics of the robust IEGs were shown in Fig. 6, but it was not found.
4
— Both Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 were presented in vertex-edge plot format, which could confuse; what is
the meaning and difference of Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.
— In the second paragraph of pg. 10, the authors mentioned that the predicted IEGs were
validated by checking for the known IEGs and the searching of the known IEGs was based on
Gene Ontology analysis. The IEGs are involved in the processes of transcription, cell activation,
cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell death and apoptosis. However, does the above term-
related gene necessarily mean it is an IEG? How confident did the authors validate their
predicted IEGs by Gene Ontology analysis?

Comments to the Author(s)
The abstract does not demark at what point it is talking about background (first, second,
third? sentences) versus work done in this paper (sentence 5 and beyond).
The abstract has now been rephrased to more clearly indicate which statements are about the
background and which relate to our results.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors analyzed the FANTOM5 CAGE datasets which determined an array of time-course
gene expression across cell types and different stimuli and studied the regulation of the
immediate-early genes (IEGs). A robust set (the early peak-patterns of their time-course gene
expression are conserved in at least seven out of total eight datasets) and permissive set
(conserved in at least four out of total eight datasets) of IEGs were first identified.
Interestingly, the hierarchical clustering of the peak expression time of the permissive IEGs
well recapitulates the well-known relationships between cell types. The relative promoter
activation orderings of the robust IEGs were then analyzed. By connecting the precedent and
following genes, the results suggest a comprehensive gene network of the robust IEGs.
Further, the authors performed a pathway analysis (InnateDB) and the most part of their
predicted gene network was consistent with InnateDB. Moreover, a substantial set of novel
IEG regulation relationships was inferred from the temporal activation ordering analysis.
Owing to the superiority of the FANTOM5 CAGE data in detecting ncRNAs and the alternative
promoter usage, the authors further analyzed a novel set of immediate-early response (IER)
ncRNAs and suggested their possible function.
We thank the reviewer for their appreciation of our methodology and results.
Comments:
This study was well performed and the most analyses were reasonable. Moreover, quantities
of the interesting inferences illustrating the IEG regulation were drawn from the results.
However, there remain several questions to be answered. A re-organization of the whole
can be easily read and understood by the readers.
We have acted on these comments and have reorganised the text, figures, and figure captions.
The number of figures has been reduced from 8 to 5, and figures 4 and 5 have been extensively
revised.
—The relationship between the IER ncRNAs and their downstream genes is unclear. How do
the IER ncRNAs regulate the downstream genes? Please explain the potential mechanisms
through further analysis of the regulatory mechanism of the IER ncRNAs.
We investigated the potential regulation of protein-coding genes in the robust set by miR-3654,
miR-15a and miR-21 (in the ncRNA set, Table 2) and found 4, 6 and 12 candidate miRNA-gene
associations, respectively, in the TargetScan database. The best TargetScan context++ scores
ranged from -0.62 to -0.27 indicating a plausible interaction for each miRNA. However, we
hesitate to make claims about these specific interactions in our manuscript without additional
evidence. The impact of the gene families U1, U2 and U4 on splicing represents another
possible mechanism linking ncRNA and protein-coding genes, but once more uncertainty in the
evidence leads us to hesitate to make specific claims that go beyond the data we have.
—The result of IEG analysis suggests that a large number (8,785) of IEGs show the IER peak in
at least one dataset, whereas only 42 IEGs are consistent in at least seven datasets. The
readers would be interested about why the most IEGs happen in the specific cell type or under
the specific stimulus. For example, the permissive IEGs which are excluded from the robust
set of IEGs. The authors may take several permissive IEGs as an example to illustrate the cell
type- or stimulus-specific IEGs.
We have added an analysis of the overlap between genes that peak (excluding the robust set
as advised) in all possible pairwise comparisons between datasets (p9 line 185, and Table S3).
This shows that at least 8% of peaking genes are shared, and up to 50% are shared where the
cell types are the same. The intersections between sets of 3 datasets become smaller
consequently.
—The current manuscript is confused due to not well-organized style and could set obstacles
in reading. For example:
—The first paragraph in pg. 10 is very confusing. It would be better to integrate this paragraph
within the ncRNA section.
We have extensively revised the manuscript and altered the order of results in the later sections
to address these issues.
—Discussion section almost repeats the context within the last section of Results. It would be
better to rephrase these two parts and make only one section.
The Discussion has been revised.
—In Materials and methods, there is no subtitle for every section. The subtitle would be helpful
to clear whole view of this study.
This problem has been remedied by adding subtitles.
—The presenting style of the figures in the current manuscript is confusing. For example:
—The idea that the authors want to present in Fig. 4 is very difficult to interpret.
—The scatter plots in Fig. 6 illustrate the temporal ordering of the robust IEGs. As a result, it
would be better to integrate the Fig. 6 scatterplots with Fig. 7. Moreover, the authors
mentioned the dynamics of the robust IEGs were shown in Fig. 6, but it was not found.
—Both Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 were presented in vertex-edge plot format, which could confuse; what
is the meaning and difference of Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.
We have taken these points on board and reduced the number of figures to 5. Two problematic
figures (previously 4, and 6) have been revised: Figure 3 now shows promoter usage and
Figure 5 shows expression changes over time. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, Figure 5
now shows selected temporal precedence relations, and the entire graph of such relations now
appears in Figure 4. Please note, we provide all figures in portrait (A4 or smaller) format and
cannot influence the journal pdf preparation process that the referee refers to.
—In the second paragraph of pg. 10, the authors mentioned that the predicted IEGs were
validated by checking for the known IEGs and the searching of the known IEGs was based on
Gene Ontology analysis. The IEGs are involved in the processes of transcription, cell
activation, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell death and apoptosis. However, does the
above term-related gene necessarily mean it is an IEG? How confident did the authors validate
their predicted IEGs by Gene Ontology analysis?
We have taken steps to address this question by investigating the overlap between GO terms
found for IEGs and for peaking genes. We find over 30% of GO terms found for peaking genes
in the robust set are also found for IEGs (page 11, paragraph starting line 225 and Table S5).
Appendix B
We thank the referees and editors for their careful review of our manuscript. In response to
he referee’s comments, we have reviewed all figures and added labels to the axes where
hey were missing in two cases. To address the question of the categorization of genes as
mmediate early genes (IEGs) or as transcription factors, or both, we have added a sentence
o the introduction to clarify that 20% of IEGs are transcription factors, and we name genes
hat fall into both classifications where they are explicitly mentioned in the manuscript. In
particular, in the caption of Figure 4 we note the IEGs that are in the conserved network that
re also transcription factors. These changes clarify the dual role of these genes.
