The authors present a brief, but compelling overview of the role of angiocrine signals in the
skeletal system. The review provides insights on the impact of the angiocrine crosstalk on both
bone physiology and pathology, describing how vasculature is involved in maintenance of bone
homeostasis, but also in bone loss due to ageing or inflammation and in regulating malignant
progression in the bone marrow.

reader to a choice of the key literature for further details. I would only suggest a few minor
modifications for clarity and precision:
1) The figures are clear and summarize how angiocrine signals regulate the bone organ.
However, they are very compact and writings are difficult to read. I would suggest to enlarge the
font and to rearrange the panels vertically, so as to have more space to make each panel bigger
and more immediately comprehensible for the reader.

long and would probably benefit from being split in two.

Dear Dr Kusumbe
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-19-0144 entitled "Angiocrine signals in
bone development, homeostasis and disease" has been accepted by the Editor for publication in
Open Biology. The reviewer has recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to their comments and revise
your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
3
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,

We are grateful to the reviewer for the positive comments and valuable suggestions.
1) The figures are clear and summarize how angiocrine signals regulate the bone organ.
However, they are very compact and writings are difficult to read. I would suggest to
enlarge the font and to rearrange the panels vertically, so as to have more space to make
each panel bigger and more immediately comprehensible for the reader.
We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We have increased the font size and
rearranged the figures so that these are bigger.
2) On page 9, the sentence starting with “Also, the expansion of Type H blood vessels…” is
quite long and would probably benefit from being split in two.
We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. As suggested we have now split
this sentence in two.
