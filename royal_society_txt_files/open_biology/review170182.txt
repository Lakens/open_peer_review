The review article “Is inflammatory micronucleation the key to a successful anti-mitotic cancer
drug? “is a thought provoking, inspiring and timely text discussing the question whether
micronucleation triggered by taxane-derived drugs may induce cGAS-STING dependent
inflammatory signaling. The authors argue that this explanation would clarify why Paclitaxel is a
successful anti-cancer drug, whereas other candidates that specifically target mitosis, including
inhibitors of Kinesin-5, Aurora A and B and Plk1, disappointed in the clinic. The manuscript is
logically structured and clearly written and collects together information from distant areas of
biology to formulate a novel insight that might enable novel hypotheses that can be relatively
easily tested in experimental settings. This manuscript will be likely interesting to a broad
scientific audience and is suitable for publication in Open Biology. There are several points that
should be considered by the authors before publishing the manuscript.
1. The authors state: “These effects will likely lead to gradual accumulation of multinucleated
cells in a drug treated tumor “(page 3, bottom). It is unclear why the multinucleated cells should
accumulate. Micronuclei that arise in one mitosis become likely reincorporate to the main
chromosome mass in the next mitosis. If there would be always the same rate of missegregation,
then the fraction of cells with micronuclei should remain similar. Perhaps the authors speculate
that the micronucleated cells with grape-shaped nuclei arrest in G1. If that’s the case, it should be
clearly stated.
2. The authors suggest that additional DNA damage might occur in the micronuclei in G1 cells
that slip out of mitosis in paclitaxel. They cite results from Pellman group to support this point.
However, the DNA damage observed in micronuclei in Crasta et al, 2012, depends on initiation of
S phase. Thus, the DNA damage in micronucleated cells that arrest in G1 likely does not depend
on the same mechanism.
3. The authors state: “Taxanes are most active in a subset of adult solid tumors, and are not used
to treat leukemias, which might hold a clue to their selectivity. “ Are the leukocytes and other
blood cells micronucleating upon taxane treatments? This might be explored. Most cell lines
differ widely in the degree of micronucleation in response to taxane (or colchicine).
4. The authors omitted some reports that might support their hypothesis, e.g. Whole
Chromosome Instability induces senescence and promotes SASP, Andriani et al Scientific Reports
6, Article number: 35218 (2016). Recently, several novel articles that support the hypothesis have
been published: Mitotic progression following DNA damage enables pattern recognition within
micronuclei. Harding et al, Nature. 2017 Jul 31. doi: 10.1038/nature23470 or cGAS surveillance of
micronuclei links genome instability to innate immunity, Mackenzie et al, Nature. 2017
doi:10.1038/nature23449
5. Several spelling errors should be corrected, e.g. page 3, top: “call-autonomous death” should be
probably “cell-autonomous death”; page 8, bottom “Finally, Inflammatory signaling“ should be
“Finally, inflammatory signalling”; page 9 middle: “micronucleation that mitosis-specific drugs”
should be “micronucleation than mitosis-specific drugs “ and more.
6. The manuscript is interesting, but with 4700 words it feels overly lengthy and wordy,
particularly in the more speculative parts. While it is noteworthy that the authors addressed
every possible aspect of their hypothesis, it would be advisable to shorten some of the parts on
topics with minimal supporting evidence.

This manuscript from Mitchison et al addresses the failure of novel anti-mitotic drugs to replicate
the efficacy of microtubule-targeted agents (such as paclitaxel) in the clinic. The authors propose
a novel three-part hypothesis to explain this failure. First, paclitaxel induces micronucleation in
cells after they exit from mitosis in its presence, while the novel anti-mitotic drugs do not.
Second, micronucleation induces DNA damage and inflammation. Third, the inflammation in
cells that have passed through mitosis in the presence of paclitaxel results in whole tumor
responses. This represents a novel view of the significant effect of paclitaxel and an explanation
for the clinical failure of drugs designed to recapitulate its ability to induce mitotic arrest.
Although this manuscript is submitted as a review, it reads much more like a perspective than a
traditional review. Considered as a perspective, the hypothesis presented is attractive in the
sense that it offers a series of testable proposals about how paclitaxel exerts cytotoxicity and why
other drugs designed to mimic its behavior do not. The manuscript appropriately indicates that
this hypothesis relies on untested assumptions and is therefore speculative.
It will be interesting for the field to determine whether paclitaxel exerts its cytotoxicity as a
consequence of multinucleation. It seems unlikely that this will explain the difference in efficacy
between paclitaxel and other mitotic inhibitors (eg inhibitors of Aurora A, Aurora B, CENP-E and
Plk1) since, in our cells, inhibition of Eg5 or Plk1 does result in multinucleation. (Treatment with
the CENP-E inhibitor GSK923295 may also induce multinucleation, based on Fig. S5 and Movie
S1 in Wood et al, PNAS 2010). The evidence cited here that multinucleation is specific to
paclitaxel and does not occur after treatment with other mitotic inhibitors comes from a single
4
cell line (HT1080) and a single inhibitor (the Eg5 inhibitor Ispinesib). Consistent evidence from
additional cell lines (and drugs) would greatly strengthen this proposal (particularly since the
inability of other anti-mitotic drugs to induce multinucleation does not appear to be universal).
The second part of the hypothesis, that micronucleation induces DNA damage, seems reasonable
to predict based on the work cited although, as clearly stated, this has yet to be formally
demonstrated. The figure in Panel 3B isn’t particularly supportive of this conclusion, however,
since only 1 of 2 paclitaxel-treated cells appears to have a higher level of DNA breaks than the cell
treated with an Eg5 inhibitor and there’s no quantitation.
The third part of the hypothesis, that inflammatory signaling from a subset of cells allows a
response to the entire tumor, addresses the question of how a drug acting on mitosis can have a
substantial impact on tumors in which very few cells are in mitosis. While it is attractive to posit
an explanation for widespread effects of a mitosis-specific drug, the argument from Fojo and
colleagues (Komlodi-Pasztor et al, Nature Rev Clin Oncol 2011) that the proliferation rate in
tumors is exceedingly low is probably given too much weight. The evidence provided in that
review is from tumor doubling times, which do not take cell death into account. Direct
measurement of the mitotic index in tumors is necessary to make this claim convincingly. These
measurements are difficult to find, and references have not been provided here. Additionally, as
stated here, paclitaxel is retained in cells over an extended period (giving cells an extended
window in which to enter mitosis in its presence), while Ispinesib is not. This offers another
potential explanation for the difference in their efficacy.
The perspective also probably relies overly heavily on the idea that paclitaxel exerts its effects on
tumors via mitotic arrest, in light of the cited evidence that mitotic arrest doesn’t correlate with
paclitaxel response (Milross et al, J Natl Cancer Inst 1996; Symmans et al, Clin Cancer Res 2000;
Zasadil et al, Sci Transl Med 2014).
Overall, I look forward to seeing these ideas thoroughly tested.
Minor comment: The legend for Figure 2C should indicate what the red and green colors indicate.
