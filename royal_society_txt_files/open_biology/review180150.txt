This is an excellent and timely review about paraspeckles and the RNA mileux. There is
increasing interest in the RNA world and how it interacts with, and orchestrates, the role of IDR-
containing RNA-binding proteins in forming non-membranous cellular bodies. There is also an
increasing appreciation of how these phase-separated assemblies of proteins/RNA are involved
regulating many fundamental cellular processes and how defects in these versatile assemblies
underlie disease. The review lays out various key aspects of what is known and what is still to be
discovered. Overall, it is interesting and very informative and presents a well-balanced view. It is
written in a way that is accessible and easy to understand for those not directly in the field and
the figures illustrate the points well. The description of the core-shell design of the paraspeckles
is particularly illuminating and will captivate the interest of readers. The use of metaphors is
particularly effective such as the beginning ‘salad bowl of mixed vegetables’.
Minor Comment:
1. It is not clear what the colours represent in some of the diagrams. For example, what are the
yellow ovals in Figure 1C, and the pink spheres, blue and green short curved lines Figure 3D?
The authors should define these in the figure legend, or add a key to the diagram.

The review by Nakagawa and colleagues is addressing an important facet of cellular metabolism
– regulation of cellular processes by nuclear RNP granules called paraspeckles. This review
summarises most recent advances in determining their structure and function. They also discuss
paraspeckles in a wider context, as a component of RNP granule continuum in the cell. ENCODE
eCLIP analysis of proteins bound to NEAT1 is a nice addition and provides evidence that the
cross-talk between paraspeckles and RBPs is more extensive than previously believed. Below are
specific points to be addressed to improve this review.
1. Abstract: Line 4, ‘binding proteins’ – did authors mean ‘RNA-binding proteins’? The abstract
could be improved. In its current form it gives an impression that all types of RNA granules will
be discussed. However, the main text is focused on paraspeckles, with other RNA granules barely
mentioned.
2. The authors may consider modifying the introductory sentences. While I appreciate the
colourful language and the metaphor, it looks a bit out of place (especially this metaphoric line is
not followed up or built upon later in the text).
3. Introduction: P-granules is the only RNA granule list type not seen in mammalian cells, would
be more natural to add other examples of granules seen in different invertebrate species and
absent in mammals.
4. Introduction: I would argue over the statement that ‘specificity and regulation of phase
separation in living cells is largely unknown’. For example, multiple studies in cells have shown
the importance of post-translational protein modifications (methylation, citrulllination) in phase
transitions in cells. Regarding specificity, fine studies into amino acid composition
(tyrosine/arginine ratio) of proteins undergoing phase separation have also been reported.
5. Protein and RNA components of paraspeckles:
- Page 5, Ref 23 does not feature a ‘complete list of paraspeckle proteins’, since it does not cite Ref
23 and hence does not include PSPs identified by CHART. Also, strictly speaking, CHART data
obtained using probes in the region common for the two isoforms cannot be taken as a proof of
paraspeckle localisation of the protein (it has to be confirmed by imaging). I also had an
impression that the role of LLPS in paraspeckle assembly is an established fact (Hennig et al.
paper). Is there a reference for the existence of NEAT1 orthologues in all vertebrates?
- Page 6: is there evidence for NEAT1_1 localisation outside paraspeckles in cells that do express
NEAT1_2 and possess paraspeckles? Ref. 35 is not available yet. Typo ‘electron microscopy
study’.
- Page 7: Last sentence of the chapter needs revision, clumsy in its current form, with repetitions.
6. Cellular function of paraspeckles:
- Page 7: Refs 37 and 38 describe sequestration of proteins but not RNAs. I would replace ‘at the
animal level’ by ‘at the organismal level’.
4
- Page 8. Gene expression changes have been studied in cells (human or mouse) following loss of
both NEAT1 (knockdown or knockout) rather than NEAT1_2 alone. Could authors
predict/speculate whether the expression changes will be more dramatic if NEAT1_2 is
downregulated while NEAT1 stays around?
- Page 9: Last sentence of the chapter: ‘examined in NEAT1-depleted models’.
7. Physiological function of paraspeckles:
- Page 9: Is it justifiable to call the physiological consequences of NEAT1/paraspeckle loss
‘dramatic’ if the animals are viable, grossly normal and even the most pronounced phenotype
(infertility) is only seen in half of animals? Although the subheading refers to physiological
function of paraspeckles, discussion of their pathological function (cancer studies) is also
included here.
8. Ordered internal structure of paraspeckles.
- Page 9: Typo ‘diameter ..is’
9. Assembly of paraspeckles and LLPS
Have the authors seen the study by Li et al. (2018) Structural analyses of NEAT1 lncRNAs
suggest long-range RNA interactions that may contribute to paraspeckle architecture (NAR)
which reaches roughly the same conclusions as in Ref. 13?
10. Possible interplay between the ‘RNP milieux’.
- Page 13: It should be specified that ‘Neat1_2 is normally absent in the neuronal cells..’. I cannot
see a link between Neat1 RNA stability and abnormal aggregation of RBPs in stressed neurons..’
Also, there is extensive literature that insoluble fibres of proteins might be actually protective for
neurons. Authors may consider re-wording this sentence.
- Page 14: Figure 7 is missing (and there is no Figure 6 either). What are ‘the cohort studies on
NEAT1 and various cancers’? Last sentence of the chapter – typo ‘mediates’.
11. Figure 1C – typo in ‘tumour’. What is the purple dot – SFPQ? Should be provided in the key.
Makes sense to put a cross on IL8 promoter which is repressed by SFPQ. What are ‘IVRs’ –
inverted repeats (should be IRs then)? Figure 4 – what is ‘proteinous milieu’ – RBPs not bound to
RNAs?

Point by point responses to the reviewers' comments
First of all, we would like to thank both of the reviewers for positive and
constructive comments. We have modified the figure and text as detailed
below to improve the manuscript according to the reviewers' thoughtful
suggestions.
Referee: 1
We thank the encouraging comments by this reviewer and constructive
suggestions to improve the manuscript.
1. It is not clear what the colours represent in some of the diagrams. For example, what
are the yellow ovals in Figure 1C, and the pink spheres, blue and green short curved
lines Figure 3D? The authors should define these in the figure legend, or add a key to
the diagram.
We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We added new diagram in
Figure 1C and 3D to clarify the points raised by the reviewer.
Referee: 2
We would like to thank this reviewer for intensive and careful reading of the
manuscript and thoughtful comments that picked up logical and grammatical
errors found in the original manuscript.
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
1. Abstract: Line 4, ‘binding proteins’ – did authors mean ‘RNA-binding proteins’? The
abstract could be improved. In its current form it gives an impression that all types of
RNA granules will be discussed. However, the main text is focused on paraspeckles, with
other RNA granules barely mentioned.
We thank the reviewer for this comment. According to the reviewer's
comments, we have modified the text to tone down the statement on RNA
related granules (page 2, line 9).
2. The authors may consider modifying the introductory sentences. While I appreciate
the colourful language and the metaphor, it looks a bit out of place (especially this
metaphoric line is not followed up or built upon later in the text).
We appreciate the reviewer's comment, but we tried to attract readers not
directly in the field and we believe the metaphorical words would help.
According to a comment from the other reviewer that "The use of metaphors
is particularly effective such as the beginning ‘salad bowl of mixed
vegetables", we left these sentences.
3. Introduction: P-granules is the only RNA granule list type not seen in mammalian cells,
would be more natural to add other examples of granules seen in different invertebrate
species and absent in mammals.
We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We used more general term
"germ granules" and mentioned that they are found in particular vertebrate and
invertebrate species (page 3, line 12-13).
4. Introduction: I would argue over the statement that ‘specificity and regulation of
phase separation in living cells is largely unknown’. For example, multiple studies in cells
have shown the importance of post-translational protein modifications (methylation,
citrulllination) in phase transitions in cells. Regarding specificity, fine studies into amino
acid composition (tyrosine/arginine ratio) of proteins undergoing phase separation have
also been reported.
We thank the reviewer for the updated information we have missed. We cited
very recent papers on the specificity and control of the phase separation, and
removed the statement "largely unknown" (page 3, line 19-21).
5. Protein and RNA components of paraspeckles:
- Page 5, Ref 23 does not feature a ‘complete list of paraspeckle proteins’, since it does
not cite Ref 23 and hence does not include PSPs identified by CHART. Also, strictly
speaking, CHART data obtained using probes in the region common for the two isoforms
cannot be taken as a proof of paraspeckle localisation of the protein (it has to be
confirmed by imaging). I also had an impression that the role of LLPS in paraspeckle
assembly is an established fact (Hennig et al. paper). Is there a reference for the
existence of NEAT1 orthologues in all vertebrates?
We thank the reviewer for raising these important issues. We agree the lack of
cell biological data on CHART-identified paraspeckle proteins, and added the
sentence "although the localization of these 2 proteins have not been tested
immunohistochemically" (page 4, line 28-30). We also used the word
"comprehensive" instead of "complete", to tone down the statement (page 4,
line 30). We agree that LLPS in paraspeckle formation is not "an intriguing
idea", but is rather reported fact, and thus changed the phrase as ",which is
consistent with recent observations that demonstrate paraspeckles are formed
via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)" (page 4, line 35 - page 5, line 2).
As for the NEAT1 orthologues, we newly cited a book chapter investigating
the sytenic region of NEAT1/MALAT1 (Stadler, 2010) (page 5, line 6).
- Page 6: is there evidence for NEAT1_1 localisation outside paraspeckles in cells that do
express NEAT1_2 and possess paraspeckles? Ref. 35 is not available yet. Typo ‘electron
microscopy study’.
Consistent with a previous report (Li et al., 2016), we routinely observe
NEAT1_1 signals that do not overlap with signals detected with NEAT1_2
specific probes, if not prominent, in paraspeckle containing cells that strongly
express NEAT1_2. We corrected the typo. Ref. 35 is accepted by a journal
and will be published soon.
- Page 7: Last sentence of the chapter needs revision, clumsy in its current form, with
repetitions.
We removed the last sentence for clarity, because it was misleading and
somewhat redundant.
6. Cellular function of paraspeckles:
- Page 7: Refs 37 and 38 describe sequestration of proteins but not RNAs. I would
replace ‘at the animal level’ by ‘at the organismal level’.
We added references showing the retention of target mRNAs in the
paraspeckles (page 6, line 18). We also changed "animal level" into
"organism level" (page 6, line 19).
- Page 8. Gene expression changes have been studied in cells (human or mouse)
following loss of both NEAT1 (knockdown or knockout) rather than NEAT1_2 alone.
Could authors predict/speculate whether the expression changes will be more dramatic
if NEAT1_2 is downregulated while NEAT1 stays around?
We thank the reviewer for raising an interesting possibility we have not
mentioned. Li et al. (RNA 2017) reported that Neat1_2-specific depletion
does not result in dramatic cellular phenotypes except for the lack of
paraspeckles. However, the function of Neat1_1 alone has not been tested in
the animal model, and we discussed this issue in the section "physiological
function of paraspeckles" (page 8, line 24-28).
- Page 9: Last sentence of the chapter: ‘examined in NEAT1-depleted models’.
We have modified the text according to the reviewer's suggestion (page 12,
line 3-4).
7. Physiological function of paraspeckles:
- Page 9: Is it justifiable to call the physiological consequences of NEAT1/paraspeckle
loss ‘dramatic’ if the animals are viable, grossly normal and even the most pronounced
phenotype (infertility) is only seen in half of animals? Although the subheading refers to
physiological function of paraspeckles, discussion of their pathological function (cancer
studies) is also included here.
We thank the reviewer for pointing out the ambiguity. Indeed, the phenotype
is dramatic if we look at the cells in the affected animals (complete loss of
differentiated luteal cells/dramatic decrease or increase of transformed cells).
We thus added a sentence "dramatic, when focusing on specific cell types
under particular conditions" (page 8, line 8). We also modified the title of the
section "physiological and pathological..." (page 8, line 5)
8. Ordered internal structure of paraspeckles.
- Page 9: Typo ‘diameter ..is’
We have modified the typo according to the reviewer's suggestion.(page 10,
line 4)
9. Assembly of paraspeckles and LLPS
Have the authors seen the study by Li et al. (2018) Structural analyses of NEAT1 lncRNAs
suggest long-range RNA interactions that may contribute to paraspeckle architecture
(NAR) which reaches roughly the same conclusions as in Ref. 13?
We appreciate the reviewer for highlighting the important reference we failed
to cite. We carefully looked into the published data, but the local secondary
structures do not necessarily coincide with the functional domains defined by
the mutant analyses. However, the paper revealed the long range interaction of
the 5' and 3' regions of NEAT1, which might provide a molecular basis for
the co-distribution of these regions in the surface of the paraspeckles. We thus
cited this paper in the perspective section, as an example for the useful use of
structure information for functional prediction (page 15, line 9-12).
10. Possible interplay between the ‘RNP milieux’.
- Page 13: It should be specified that ‘Neat1_2 is normally absent in the neuronal cells..’.
I cannot see a link between Neat1 RNA stability and abnormal aggregation of RBPs in
stressed neurons..’ Also, there is extensive literature that insoluble fibres of proteins
might be actually protective for neurons. Authors may consider re-wording this
sentence.
We thank the reviewer for pointing out the ambiguous and improper sentences.
We specified the neurons as motor neurons in the spinal cord (page 12, line
23). As for the link between NEAT1 and RBP, we have modified the text as
follows:
"...it is also possible that Neat1 enables dynamic turnover of associating
aggregation-prone RBPs with IDRs in stressed neurons" (page 12, line 30-32).
We also removed the word "undergo cell death" to leave the possibility that
insoluble fibers plays a protective role.
- Page 14: Figure 7 is missing (and there is no Figure 6 either). What are ‘the cohort
studies on NEAT1 and various cancers’? Last sentence of the chapter – typo ‘mediates’.
According to the reviewer's suggestion, we have corrected the typo. We
removed the sentence on the cohort studies, which might be confusing.
11. Figure 1C – typo in ‘tumour’. What is the purple dot – SFPQ? Should be provided in
the key. Makes sense to put a cross on IL8 promoter which is repressed by SFPQ. What
are ‘IVRs’ – inverted repeats (should be IRs then)? Figure 4 – what is ‘proteinous milieu’
– RBPs not bound to RNAs?
We have modified the text, figures, and figure legends according to the
reviewer's suggestions.
