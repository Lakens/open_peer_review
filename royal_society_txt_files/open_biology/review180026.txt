General comments to the manuscript:
The review is dealing with interesting aspects of GAG, however, it brings in many passages some
disorder instead of clarity. First of all, it should be clearly figured out which terms the authors
involved in their search and on which topics and aims the review is focused. The manuscript
provides a lot of information – some of them are quite general, some of them are too detailed and
only intelligible for insiders – however all in all, a clear “red line” and structure is missing. It is
challenging to follow the jumps from mammals to insects over leukocytes, neurons and “generic”
interactions. The abstract suggested that the authors will focus in the review on “overall effects”
of GAG on cell migration and adhesion. Excepting the abstract, the term adhesion did not appear
anymore in the entire manuscript, and the term migration appeared only once.
Many proteins were mentioned by abbreviations without any explanation of their function (e. g.
guidance cue Slit to Robo… page 4, line 5).
It becomes not really clear in the text which figures, models, and computational modelling are
based on authors own work.

the revised version of your manuscript within six weeks. If you do not think you will be able to
meet this date please let us know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, please respond to the comments made by the
referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this

Appendix A
Reviewer remarks:
The review is dealing with interesting aspects of GAG, however, it
brings in many passages some disorder instead of clarity. First of all,
it should be clearly figured out which terms the authors involved in
their search and on which topics and aims the review is focused. The
manuscript provides a lot of information ? some of them are quite
general, some of them are too detailed and only intelligible for
insiders ? however all in all, a clear ?red line? and structure is
missing. It is challenging to follow the jumps from mammals to
insects over leukocytes, neurons and ?generic? interactions. The
abstract suggested that the authors will focus in the review
on ?overall effects? of GAG on cell migration and adhesion. Excepting
the abstract, the term adhesion did not appear anymore in the entire
manuscript, and the term migration appeared only once.
Inspired by the reviewer’s comments, we have reshaped the
manuscript substantially, with a focus on the role of GAGs in cell
surface receptor/ligand complex formation. We realized that the
proposal to describe the role of GAGs in receptor signaling in
terms of circuitry was too tentative, and the manuscript is now
more descriptive. We have modified the title and the abstract to
highlight the more descriptive approach taken throughout the
manuscript. We then introduce a simple concept to describe the
different roles that GAG molecules play in receptor/ligand
complex formation, based on structural evidence.
Many proteins were mentioned by abbreviations without any
explanation of their function (e. g. guidance cue Slit to Robo? page 4,
line 5).
We have tried to introduce the function of each receptor/ligand
complex described in the manuscript.
It becomes not really clear in the text which figures, models, and
computational modelling are based on authors own work.
Most figures, models and computational modeling is based on our
own work, but in case it was adapted from others we now mention
this in the text.

Page 2, introduction, line 9: Please explain what the ?so-called sugar
code? is!
In the reorganized manuscript, the sugar code is explained on page
6: Different GAGs may favor different cue/receptor engagements,
and the presence of a particular GAG in a confined area may
amplify the effect of specific cues and thus regulate certain
migration patterns. The so-called “sugar code” for axon guidance
may thus be linked to the regulation of cue/receptor complexes
[48–50].
