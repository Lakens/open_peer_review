Wang and his co-authors investigated important aspects of the regulatory mechanisms between
actin and myosin in cardiac cells. In the past limited attention has been paid to the roles of actin
isoforms, this paper provides several interesting lines of those functional details. The manuscript
presents data and considerations from experiments where the enzymatic, mechanical and single
molecule mechanistic properties of the interaction between cardiac ventricular myosin and
cardiac or skeletal actin isoforms were investigated. The Introduction chapter properly
summarizes the information available in the field. The experimental procedures and the data
analysis is properly described, the new Qdot assay is attractive and gives a special importance to
the manuscript. The authors showed that while some of the basic enzymatic parameters were not
affected by the change in the actin isoform content, skeletal actin supported larger isometric force
than cardiac actin. The conclusions the authors present are based on their observations, and they
are also interesting and important. The provide a simple model where the interaction of cardiac
ventricular myosin with different actin isoforms have a regulatory role in healthy and also in
pathological conditions.
I suggest this manuscript to be accepted as it is, or after the authors reflected to my minor
comments below. I think in the latter case the paper could be more understandable for the
general readers.
Comments, questions:
It is known that in normal mammalian adult heart muscle the ratio of skeletal to cardiac actin
isoforms is appr. 1:4. It would probably be interesting to see in experiments similar to those in
those manuscript how the mixture of actin isoforms would interact with myosin. Would they
provide results between those observed for the two isoforms separately?
How should the reader imagine the mixture of cardiac and skeletal actin isoforms? Would each of
the filaments contain the corresponding cardiac and skeletal protomers in a homogeneous
distribution along the filaments? Or would they form separate filaments after polymerisation?
Considering the observe differences between the interactions of cardiac ventricular myosin with
skeletal or cardiac actin; what are the myosin ATPase kinetic steps which possibly altered by the
replacement of the actin isoform?
In the experiments with phallodin, could this drug have any effect on the actin isoform
dependence? One can imagine that the effect of phalloidin on the dynamic properties of actin
3
may alter its force supporting function two, that can then be isoform dependent.

The manuscript “Cardiac and Skeletal Actin Substrates Uniquely Tune Cardiac Myosin Strain-
Dependent
Mechanics” by Wang et al. examines the force-velocity relationship for ß-MHC (ßmys)
propelling skeletal vs. cardiac actin using ensemble in vitro motility assays and single myosin Q-
dot assays. Cardiac and skeletal actins have >98% sequence identity and only differ at positions 2
and 3 where Asp-Glu reverses to Glu-Asp, at Met299Leu and at Ser358Thr for cardiac/skeletal
actins. Using their improved Q-dot assay, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, the authors
generated sets of data interrogating single ßmys step-size and step-frequency characteristics
when moving cardiac vs. skeletal actin under loaded conditions. While no differences are seen in
actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, they observed significant differences in myosin step-size
distribution between skeletal and cardiac actin under load related to strain-dependent mechanics.
The differences originate, at least in part, from the way the cardiac vs. skeletal actin isoforms
interact with ßmys and the interaction between the C-terminus of actin and the N-ELC terminus
of myosin (Fig. 9: stronger interaction for cardiac vs. skeletal actin). The structural change in actin
conformation imparts a subtle but significant 0.4-0.5 nm myosin displacement advantage to the
cardiac actin in vitro. It suggests a greater efficiency for actin displacement vs. ATP consumed.
4
This is a very important study providing insights into how subtle differences in the amino acid
sequence between the cardiac and fast-twitch skeletal actin isoforms lead to substantial
differences in the actin-myosin interaction when examined under load (power). Results from this
paper will be extremely important to a wide research community performing standard
biochemical/biophysical assays of actin – myosin interaction in vitro and especially those using
actin in characterizing the effect of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in cardiac myosin on
ßmys function. It also provides an explanation as to why skeletal muscle actin is often
upregulated in cardiac disease. The skeletal/cardiac actin stoichiometry is ~1:4 in a normal adult
human heart and the upregulation of skeletal isoform is observed in diseased myocardium. Fig. 4
c shows that skeletal actin upregulates power compared with cardiac and suggests that the
dynamic heart tissue upregulates the skeletal actin substrate when heart disease compromises
power production.
In conclusion, the findings of the manuscript are significant, novel and form an unquestioned
strength. It is anticipated that the study will be of interest to the broad readership of Open
Biology and therefore it is highly recommended for publication.
Specific comments to authors:
1. Introduction: Fig. 8 could be introduced as Fig. 1 in the text of the Introduction where the
authors elaborate on differences between the skeletal and cardiac actin isoforms (p. 6, lines 91-
101). The overlapped actin sequences (cardiac vs. skeletal) could be supported by the ELC amino-
acid sequence with highlighted residues important for the actin-N-ELC binding.
2. Methods are very elaborate (p.7-20) and could be simplified by (1) referencing the authors’
previous publications and leaving only those parts describing new developments that are
relevant to the current study; or (2) moved, at least in part, to the supplement.
3. The reason for bringing Fig. 2 (4-pathway contraction model) from the previously published
paper (ref. 25) into the Methods of the current manuscript is not explained or justified.
4. Results: Fig. 4 is of great importance to the understanding of physiological differences between
cardiac vs. skeletal actin, and the presentation of the figure could be improved. The middle panel
should have x-axes shown clearly just as top and bottom panels. Presentation of panels d, e, and f
needs more explanation than just “Figure 4 panels d-f parallel those in panels a-c except that [a]
sampling is limited to 0, 1, 3, and 5 µg/ml”.
5. It would be beneficial to the readers to have each figure concluded on after providing
methodological details (Figs. 5, 6). The explanation is often provided later in the Results section
rather than after the first mention of the figure.
6. Discussion often sounds like a continuation of Results (e.g. p.28/29) rather than providing an
explanation/interpretation.
7. Conclusion: The authors should avoid referencing to specific figures here and provide “a take
home message(s)” from their studies.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewers
RE: Open Biology - Manuscript RSOB-18-0143
We value the detailed commentary made by the referees and have revised the
manuscript to address their concerns as described below.
Referee 1
1. It is known that in normal mammalian adult heart muscle the ratio of
skeletal to cardiac actin isoforms is appr. 1:4. It would probably be
interesting to see in experiments similar to those in those manuscript how the
mixture of actin isoforms would interact with myosin. Would they provide
results between those observed for the two isoforms separately?
The comment is highly pertinent to investigating cardiac actin function in the
heart. We are cognizant of the 1:4 stoichiometry in normal adult human (and
bovine) ventriculum and discussed possible effects of the actin mixture on our
data (pg 18, starting line 326). There are other complications to consider as
noted in the referee’s next comment. We can address these issues in future
work by varying skeletal actin content in the mixture and by preparation of a
pure cardiac actin sample.
2. How should the reader imagine the mixture of cardiac and skeletal actin
isoforms? Would each of the filaments contain the corresponding cardiac and
skeletal protomers in a homogeneous distribution along the filaments? Or
would they form separate filaments after polymerisation?
This interesting issue has not been investigated to our knowledge. As
mentioned above, we will probably need to prepare the pure cardiac actin
isoform for new experiments on cardiac actin polymerization and cardiac
myosin motility.
3. Considering the observe differences between the interactions of cardiac
ventricular myosin with skeletal or cardiac actin; what are the myosin
ATPase kinetic steps which possibly altered by the replacement of the actin
isoform?
Our results show myosin functionality differs for the skeletal vs cardiac actin
substrates when the system is under load. Strain dependent steps (see Figure
2) seem most likely to be implicated in these conditions. Our Figure 6 shows
a strongly down-regulated 5 nm step-size and up-regulated 8 nm step-size for
the cardiac compared to skeletal actin with the imposition of light resisting
force. Myosin dynamics change at higher force as the cardiac actin muscle
shifts into the high force regime. Multiple parallel mechanical pathways make
it tricky to identify the rate affected in the high force regime. Certainly lower
ADP release rate down-regulates the 5 nm step-size in the cardiac compared
to skeletal actin at intermediate force (1-2 pN).
4. In the experiments with phallodin, could this drug have any effect on the
actin isoform dependence? One can imagine that the effect of phalloidin on
the dynamic properties of actin may alter its force supporting function two,
that can then be isoform dependent.
This in an interesting hypothesis with consequences for all in vitro motility
assays. It was shown that phalloidin and jasplakinolide promote actin filament
stability that is propagated cooperatively over the filament [1]. Either or both
drugs might alter actin filament compliance and consequently myosin strain
sensitive behavior. We use biotin-phalloidin to stabilize actin and to link the
streptavidin-Qdot to the actin filament in the motility assay. An alternative
actin stabilizing drug would provide contrast to the phalloidin-actin system
elucidating the effects on myosin strain sensitive behavior.
Referee #2
1. Introduction: Fig. 8 could be introduced as Fig. 1 in the text of the Introduction
where the authors elaborate on differences between the skeletal and cardiac actin
isoforms (p. 6, lines 91-101). The overlapped actin sequences (cardiac vs. skeletal)
could be supported by the ELC amino-acid sequence with highlighted residues
important for the actin-N-ELC binding.
We disagree with this thoughtful suggestion because Figure 8 is based on the
homology modeling of cardiac actomyosin using a skeletal actomyosin
structure template [2]. As such, it needs methods and background context to
be comprehensible to the reader and reproducible by others. The context
information is beyond the scope of the Introduction.
2. Methods are very elaborate (p.7-20) and could be simplified by (1)
referencing the authors’ previous publications and leaving only those parts
describing new developments that are relevant to the current study; or (2)
moved, at least in part, to the supplement.
We agree and have made adjustments to the Methods. The section Qdot Assay
Event-Velocity Histogram Simulation (pg 13, starting line 221) has been
mostly removed in favor of referencing previous work. We retained only the
portion describing the new baseline subtraction method.
We retained the section: Force calibration in the loaded actin in vitro motility
and Qdot assays (pg 11, starting line 187) where we describe a new method
involving dimensionless parameters K (proportional to myosin attachment rate
fAPP) and normalized force in the force-velocity relationship.
Other sections retained contain brief descriptions of protein preparation
protocols, unique statistical information, or methods we have not used
previously.
3. The reason for bringing Fig. 2 (4-pathway contraction model) from the
previously published paper (ref. 25) into the Methods of the current
manuscript is not explained or justified.
The model here is modestly changed from previous work. In Figure 2, the slip
transition in the solo 3+ nm pathway is more accurately defined. We justify
inclusion of Figure 2 in the section 4-pathway contraction model in the
revised manuscript (pg 15, lines 258-265).
4. Results: Fig. 4 is of great importance to the understanding of physiological
differences between cardiac vs. skeletal actin, and the presentation of the
figure could be improved. The middle panel should have x-axes shown clearly
just as top and bottom panels. Presentation of panels d, e, and f needs more
explanation than just “Figure 4 panels d-f parallel those in panels a-c
except that [a] sampling is limited to 0, 1, 3, and 5 µg/ml”.
We agree and have made the suggested revision to Figure 4 middle panels.
Our result summary for Figure 4 panels d-f covers a good deal more detail
than suggested in the comment. Please see pg 22 lines 411-426 in the revision.
5. It would be beneficial to the readers to have each figure concluded on after
providing methodological details (Figs. 5, 6). The explanation is often
provided later in the Results section rather than after the first mention of the
figure.
We disagree with this comment. A small delay in summarizing findings from
Figures 5 & 6 allows their integration with the ensemble averaged quantities
in Figure 7. We believe this strategy is more coherent. We have also edited
this section slightly for clarity by directing the reader to the original literature
for computing <d> and <f>. This is important in the revised manuscript
because we removed pertinent equations from the Methods section in response
to comment 2 above.
6. Discussion often sounds like a continuation of Results (e.g. p.28/29) rather
than providing an explanation/interpretation.
We revised Discussion in response to this comment by emphasizing
interpretation over reviewing results. See Discussion starting pg 31.
7. Conclusion: The authors should avoid referencing to specific figures here
and provide “a take home message(s)” from their studies.
We thoroughly revised Conclusion in response to this comment. See
Conclusion starting pg 34.
