This is a very good review and I support publication. It will be beneficial for the field of early
mouse development and it was very interesting to read.
I suggest a few points that the authors should address:
- In the Abstract, the sentence ‘Moreover, to place them in the context…’ is very unclear and
should be rewritten.
- Line 92: Many of the studies showing early developmental biases were performed in intact live
embryos, which can be considered as ‘unperturbed development’. I therefore suggest changing or
removing this sentence. Or explaining wht unperturbed development means.
- The entire paper should be carefully checked for grammar and spelling mistakes.
- They should refer to E-cadherin protein as E-cadherin or E-cad, instead of Cdh1. Most studies
in mammalian cells, as well as many papers in mouse embryos use this nomenclature (see for
example papers by De Vries et al, Stephenson et al, Fierro-Gonzalez et al, etc).
- Regarding compaction mechanisms, it is correct that Maitre et al have argued against the role of
filopodia in compaction. However, they did not provide experimental evidence against the role of
filopodia. For example, they didn’t perform any experiments on filopodia to show that
compaction is unaffected when these structures are disrupted. Also, they ignored experiments
presented in the Fierro-Gonzalez et al paper using manipulations of specific filopodia proteins
like Myosin 10. Therefore, the authors should remove the sections stating that Maitre et al
challenged the filopodia model and simply discuss what each study showed, as this would be
most beneficial for the field. It may be good to emphasize that both mechanisms (filopodia and
differences in cortex tension) could perfectly operate in parallel. They don’t need to be mutually
exclusive based on the experimental evidence so far presented.
- The discussion about the mechanisms that position the first inner cells of the embryo is very
good. However, it should be noted that direct evidence for asymmetric inheritance of apical
polarity regions or specific apical proteins is still weak. To date, there are no data clearly showing
the uneven distribution of apical domains during 8- to 16-cell stage divisions. Furthermore, some
have argued that apical polarity may not be inherited, but rather re-established during cell
division (Anani et al). It will be good to discuss this point.

In this review, Mihajlovic and Bruce carefully describe the events underlying the first cell fate
decision in early mouse development. The authors review two historical models that have been
proposed to explain early lineage segregation and go on to reconcile the 'polarity' and 'positional'
model. This is a thorough assessment of the current field and represents a comprehensive
assessment of the current understanding of these developmental events.
Major comments:
- Overall, I would suggest that the authors could consider making the overviews of these models
a little more concise, reserving space for integration of the two.
- In the section around line 438, have the authors also considered the differential adhesion
hypothesis? This could also account for the affinity of inside cells to each other.
- In the section around line 729, it would be interesting to integrate the earlier discussion of first
and second waves of asymmetric divisions being regulated to ensure a relatively constant
number of inside cells in the blastocyst. For example, what role does cell shape play in this?
Minor points:
- In early parts of the review, the term 'so-called' is overused.
- Line 196 – protein nomenclature with Cdh1 would be useful

This is a very good review and I support publication. It will be beneficial for the field of early
mouse development and it was very interesting to read.
We thank the reviewer for their positive and constructive comments. Additionally, we draw their
attention to an additional copy of the resubmitted manuscript containing highlighted tracks of all
the edits made. We hope this will aid the referees with their reappraisal (n.b. this version of the
manuscript is distinct from the ‘official’ copy of the resubmitted manuscript, in which all edits are
‘accepted’ and not readily observable).
I suggest a few points that the authors should address:
- In the Abstract, the sentence ‘Moreover, to place them in the context…’ is very unclear
and should be rewritten.
We agree with the reviewer and have now changed the relevant sentence.
- Line 92: Many of the studies showing early developmental biases were performed in intact live
embryos, which can be considered as ‘unperturbed development’. I therefore suggest changing
or removing this sentence. Or explaining what unperturbed development means.
We have modified the text by removing the statement that was previously contained within
parentheses, to reflect the reviewers concern. In our opinion, any confusion has thus been
removed.
The entire paper should be carefully checked for grammar and spelling mistakes.
We have undertaken edits to correct such concerns in the resubmitted article.
They should refer to E-cadherin protein as E-cadherin or E-cad, instead of Cdh1. Most studies
in mammalian cells, as well as many papers in mouse embryos use this nomenclature (see for
example papers by De Vries et al, Stephenson et al, Fierro-Gonzalez et al, etc).
We acknowledge the reviewer’s (and that of one of their co-reviewer’s) point that this cell
adhesion molecule/ gene has traditionally been referred to as E-cadherin (abbreviated to E-cad)
in our field. Our reasoning for using the term Cdh1, comes from the fact that this is the officially
recognised name, as used in both the Ensembl and UCSC mouse genome annotations and the
Genecards database (for the human gene homolog, CDH1). We therefore, considered it
appropriate to use this term, after first qualifying that it relates to E-cadherin when first used in
the text. Indeed, this was also the approach we undertook when referring to Ezrin (Ezr) and
aPKC<U+F07A>/<U+F069>/<U+F06C> (Prkcz/i), without reproach. However, given the fact this point has been raised by two
reviewer’s, we have now substituted the term Cdh1 with E-cad, when referring to E-cadherin
protein (after first qualifying this abbreviation when first used in the text) but nevertheless
retained the term Cdh1 when referring specifically to the gene itself.
Regarding compaction mechanisms, it is correct that Maitre et al have argued against the role
of filopodia in compaction. However, they did not provide experimental evidence against the role
of filopodia. For example, they didn’t perform any experiments on filopodia to show that
compaction is unaffected when these structures are disrupted. Also, they ignored experiments
presented in the Fierro-Gonzalez et al paper using manipulations of specific filopodia proteins
like Myosin 10. Therefore, the authors should remove the sections stating that Maitre et al
challenged the filopodia model and simply discuss what each study showed, as this would be
most beneficial for the field. It may be good to emphasize that both mechanisms (filopodia and
differences in cortex tension) could perfectly operate in parallel. They don’t need to be mutually
exclusive based on the experimental evidence so far presented.
The reviewer makes a fair point, but one that nonetheless requires further context.
According to Maitre et al., 2015, it is the observed increase in the surface tension of contactless
8-cell stage embryo blastomeres that accounts for three-quarters (¾) of the change (i.e.
decrease) in the alpha-angle between neighbouring cells as they compact (i.e. this angle
representing a quantifiable measure of compaction). This therefore argues, in their view, that it
is this force that is primarily responsible for the change in blastomere, and consequently
embryo, shape; the defining feature of compaction.
Moreover, Maitre and co-workers substantiate this claim by demonstrating the persistence of
such forces in embryos lacking the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin (i.e. utilising dual
maternal and zygotic null alleles for the E-cadherin gene; mzCdh1-/-). This is the same adhesion
molecule claimed by Fierro-Gonzalez et al., 2013, to be a critical component of a filopodia
dependent mechanism of compaction induction (study entitled: ‘Cadherin-dependent filopodia
control preimplantation embryo compaction).
As a consequence, Maitre and colleagues conclude that actomyosin contractility is the principle
force that initiates/ mediates compaction, rather than any filopodia mediated mechanism, but
they do not rule out another role for filopodia.
Therefore, it is difficult to state that Maitre and colleagues did not address the role of filopodia,
given that Fierro-Gonzalez et al. had previously demonstrated the reported importance of E-cad
to filopodia formation (utilising Cdh1-siRNA treated embryos), and they had utilised mzCdh1-/-
transgenic embryos in their study that must, by the admission of Fierro-Gonzalez, negatively
effect filopodia formation. Therefore, Maitre and colleagues indeed did address the role of
filopodia, even if not-specifically referenced by the authors themselves in their paper!
It is also perfectly valid to state, as we did in our original manuscript, that Maitre and colleagues
explicitly challenge the filopodia model of compaction, of Fierro-Gonzalez et al., with their own
data. This is because they stated in their study: ‘Alternatively, the surface tension, which was
initially attributed to filopodia following laser ablation of the cell medium interface, could be
generated by actomyosin contractility’. In our own view, this is a possibility that is difficult to
refute, given the lack of effect on contactless domain actomyosin contractility in driving
compaction observed in mzCdh1-/- 8-cell stage embryos (as referred to above). Indeed, the
RNAi-mediated disruption of other filopodia components described in the Fierro-Gonzalez et al.
study have the potential to also negatively effect actomyosin contractility, particularly the
expression of Myo10 (as referenced above by the reviewer). Alternatively, to at least effect the
overall adherence of individual blastomeres to each other (E-cad, alpha/beta-catenin – at
adherens junctions), that is a basic pre-requisite of compaction and not necessarily a feature
confined or specific to filopodia. Moreover, a second paper from the same laboratory as Fierro-
Gonzalez et al., used a similar laser ablation technique to explicitly and specifically disrupt
‘actomyosin contractility’ (Samarage et al., 2015); suggesting a change of thought on behalf of
the authors’ during the intervening time between the publication of their two studies.
Notwithstanding all of the above qualifications (that we only make so the reviewer is able to
have the necessary context to interpret our original thoughts when we wrote the first submission
of the review) it is our opinion, that the current state of the literature does not exclude a role for
E-cad/ Cdh1, nor filopodia, in compaction. However, we do think that there is a strong argument
against E-cad/ Cdh1 or E-cad/ Cdh1-dependent filopodia exerting a driving force that initiates
compaction (on the basis of the work of Maitre and colleagues using mzCdh1-/- embryos).
Accordingly, we have amended the relevant section of the main text to develop this point more
rationally and objectively; explicitly stating, as the reviewer suggested, that the two mechanisms
(i.e. cell-autonomous actomyosin contractility and non-cell-autonomous E-cad/ Cdh1-dependent
filopodia) may indeed co-exist as mechanisms supporting compaction (but not necessarily
overlapping).
- The discussion about the mechanisms that position the first inner cells of the embryo is very
good. However, it should be noted that direct evidence for asymmetric inheritance of apical
polarity regions or specific apical proteins is still weak. To date, there are no data clearly
showing the uneven distribution of apical domains during 8- to 16-cell stage divisions.
Furthermore, some have argued that apical polarity may not be inherited, but rather re-
established during cell division (Anani et al). It will be good to discuss this point.
The reviewer is right to raise this interesting point. It is more than suitable for such a review
given, as they rightly point out, the paucity of direct experimental evidence for asymmetric
inheritance of apical polarity factors, in situ. We have accordingly included a short passage to
develop this point, as suggested, in the revised manuscript (see line 451).

are ‘accepted’ and not readily observable).
Major comments:
- Overall, I would suggest that the authors could consider making the overviews of these models
a little more concise, reserving space for integration of the two.
It was our original intention to provide as comprehensive a context regarding the historical
models of ‘position’ and ‘polarity’ before then proceeding to propose/ introduce our refined
model, based on the recent advances in the field. We choose to do this in order to make the
review as accessible as possible to people just entering, or from outside, the field, whilst still
retaining relevance to those more versed within it. In essence we were aiming to produce a
universally relevant reference text. We have therefore been a little reluctant to make too many
large-scale modifications (particularly as they were not suggested by the other two reviewers)
but we have endeavoured to address the reviewer’s concerns, where at all possible.
- In the section around line 438, have the authors also considered the differential adhesion
hypothesis? This could also account for the affinity of inside cells to each other.
It is true that we have considered differential adhesion as a potential mechanism but due to any
real concrete evidence (i.e. citable literature) we decided not to include it in our originally
submitted manuscript. Given that the reviewer has now also independently raised it, we have
included a short passage making reference to it as a ‘theoretical’ possibility in the revised text.
- In the section around line 729, it would be interesting to integrate the earlier discussion of first
and second waves of asymmetric divisions being regulated to ensure a relatively constant
number of inside cells in the blastocyst. For example, what role does cell shape play in this?
We agree that this would be interesting but we were also a bit worried it maybe too speculative
for the original draft of the review. It is certainly true that outer cells, for example at the 16-cell
stage, would by definition adopt different shapes depending upon how many cells were
internalised during the first wave of asymmetric division. Indeed, we have ourselves anecdotally
observed this in embryos presenting with atypically large numbers of outer cells that exhibit
what we term, ‘columnar’ morphologies (i.e. the short axis of the blastomeres being always
perpendicular to the radial axis of the embryo). Therefore, it is possible to speculate that the
outer blastomeres of embryos with relatively greater numbers of inner cells would be more
stretched (to fully encapsulate the inner cell population) and thus would be more likely to have a
short axis that is aligned with the overall radial axis of the embryo. Hence, if cells are biased to
divide across their shortest axis (as has been demonstrated in frog embryo blastomeres;
Strauss et al., 2006), it is possible to imagine a mechanism by which outer cell shape (as
affected by the size of the inner cell population) could influence outer cell division orientation
during 16- to 32- cell transition and hence regulate total inner cell number by the early
blastocyst stage. This is additionally supported by the fact Korotkevich et al., 2017, report more
perfect alignment of mitotic spindles along the radial axis of the embryo in cells with smaller
apical domains (i.e. that also have their shortest cell axis perpendicular to the embryo’s radial
axis) that in turn gives rise to more asymmetric cell divisions.
We have now included a few sentences to highlight the potential role of cell shape (including
contacts – see comments of referee three) in regulating the number of inner cells by the early
blastocyst stage.
Minor points:
- In early parts of the review, the term 'so-called' is overused.
We have scaled back the overuse of this term in the revised version of the manuscript.
- Line 196 – protein nomenclature with Cdh1 would be useful
We refer the reviewer to our response to a similar point made by referee number 1 above.

This review summarises the current knowledge, opinions and theories about the first cell fate
decision in the mouse embryo, particularly how the two traditional models: cell polarity and cell
position models, can be merged in the context of natural developmental processes. The
manuscript is comprehensive, well-organized and interesting. I would recommend its publication.
However, there are some imprecisions in citing references or explanation of the existing
literature. The article would also benefit greatly from being shortened.
I will indicate below some way of how all of these can be fixed. Specific points that have to be
addressed before publication:
The reviewer’s time and effort in preparing the fair and helpful critique of our manuscript is
greatly appreciated. Additionally, we draw their attention to an additional copy of the
resubmitted manuscript containing highlighted tracks of all the edits made. We hope this will aid
the referees with their reappraisal (n.b. this version of the manuscript is distinct from the ‘official’
copy of the resubmitted manuscript, in which all edits are ‘accepted’ and not readily
observable).
1. compaction and polarisation section
a. in the paragraph explaining how mechanical force controls compaction (page 6line 223 and
line 237; page 7 line 242), “Maitre et al., 2016” should be “Maitre et al.,2015”. The original
citation focuses on how mechanical force connects to Hippo pathway activation and
subsequently trophectoderm fate specification, whilst the suggested publication actually focuses
on compaction.
We have corrected the two citations to now read as ‘Maitre et al., 2015’, plus a further incidence
relating to compaction were the incorrect Maitre et al., paper was originally cited.
b. the authors assert that the earliest event documented related to the commence of
polarisation is the phosphorylation of Ezrin. However, this description seems inaccurate from
two perspectives: 1) published literature suggests that Ezrin phosphorylation is controlled by
aPKC (Liu et al., 2013), which polarises apically in a similar time-window as Ezrin. Thus it
seems that at least aPKC activation would take place before Ezrin phosphorylation and
therefore the latter is unlikely the earliest event related to polarization establishment. 2) all
published studies use the antibody to detect the phosphorylation level of the entire ERM family,
which includes Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin, rather than Ezrin itself. Thus, the description that
Ezrin is the dominant protein phosphorylated at the 8-cell stage could be imprecise.
In terms of the original reference to ‘the earliest documented event of polarisation’ we
acknowledge the reviewers point that this may not necessarily be the case. As such we have
now amended the main text to read ‘one of the earliest events’.
In regard to the published literature regarding the phosphorylation of Ezrin (developed in the
reviewers first sub-point), it is our opinion that the case for the role of aPKC has not been fully
demonstrated and indeed the work of Liu et al., 2013, (referenced by the reviewer) is
contradicted by earlier work of Dard et al., 2009. Specifically and to provide context, Ezrin
phosphorylation at residue T567 has been shown in 8-cell blastomeres to occur at cell-to-cell
contact regions (Dard et al., 2004; excluding p-Ezrin to the contactless apical domain and thus
facilitating adherens junction formation in the basolateral region). Therefore, it is difficult to
reconcile how the ‘coincident’ apical enrichment of aPKC could be responsible for this initial
phosphorylation event. Moreover, over-expression of non-phosphorylatable Ezrin mutants have
been shown to prevent embryo compaction (Dard et al., 2004), but no such similar compaction
defects have been observed when aPKC activity or expression has been ablated (Dard et al.,
2009, Plusa et al., 2005, Hirate et al., 2013, Hirate et al., 2015; plus Liu et al., 2013 themselves).
Indeed, when Liu and colleagues clonally down-regulated aPKC expression using microinjected
siRNAs, they reported a complete loss of p-Ezrin expression, in the clone, at the 8-cell stage
(despite the illustrative example in the figure clearly exhibiting inner cells) but the whole embryo
nevertheless still appeared to be compacted; raising the question why the manipulated clone
was able to compact and thus arguing against a role for aPKC in initiating compaction.
Furthermore, the study of Dard et al., 2009, also showed that after aPKC knock-down (siRNA
mediated) mis-localisation of p-Ezrin protein to basolateral membranes was only observed from
the 16-cell stage, after successful embryo compaction, and not before. This is a 16-cell stage
phenotype very similar that that we ourselves observe after Rock1/2 inhibition, when apical-
basolateral polarity is completely disrupted (with atypical overlapping domains of apical and
basolateral protein factor expression around the entire cell membrane) suggesting the role of
aPKC in terms of Ezrin phosphorylation, may be to maintain p-Ezrin at the contactless apical
domain, rather than trigger its initial localisation there.
Therefore, we are not comfortable with stating aPKC dependent phosphorylation of ezrin as the
earliest known event in compaction, for the reasons explained above (that in themselves are too
detailed and specific to include in the revised manuscript). Consequently, we hope the reviewer
will be satisfied with our modification simply stating that Ezrin phosphorylation is ‘one of the
earliest events’.
In relation to sub-point 2, the reviewer is correct to highlight what is a common inaccuracy in
referring to phospho-Ezrin protein expression in the preimplantation mouse embryo in our field,
using anti-sera that actually recognise phospho-forms of Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin (i.e. anti-
pERM). However, it should be noted that the cited work of Louvet et al., 1996, and Dard et al.,
2004, in our review, explicitly utilised antibodies that specifically recognise Ezrin only (see
materials and methods in Louvet et al., 1996) and furthermore, employ recombinant constructs
of Ezrin to substantiate their conclusions. However, the work of Liu et al., 2013, did employ the
widely utilise anti-pERM antibody and as a consequence we have highlighted this as a
qualifying caveat in the revised version of the relevant main text.
We have now added a qualifying sentence to the revised main text that explains this cautionary
caveat.
c. the whole section of compaction and polarisation is highly focused on the impact of these two
events on morphogenesis of blastocyst (such as the tight junction assembly and cavitation),
rather than their link to cell fate. This somewhat impairs the adherence of the whole review
which is aiming to reconcile the polarity and position model in TE and ICM specification. I
suggest extensive shortening of this section.
We have endeavoured to shorten this section but would like to highlight its importance in
‘setting the scene’ regarding the discussion of the findings of the studies of Fierro-Gonzalez et
al. 2013 and Maitre et al. 2015 in relation to compaction. Specifically, to satisfactorily introduce
the emergence of adherens junctions as they play a central role in regulating the activity of the
Hippo-signalling pathway in relation to apical-basolateral polarity and ultimately the derivation of
blastocyst cell fate. Additionally, it is also necessary to introduce these concepts in order to
facilitate understanding relating to the impact of actomyosin contractility in driving the dynamic
forces that underpin positioning of cells according to the ‘polarity dependent cell positioning’
model we develop by the end of the review.
Additionally, this section also satisfies our intent to provide a universally accessible reference
text (as expanded in our response to reviewer number 2; see above).
2. The establishment of two spatially distinct cell populations section
a. The first publication directly showing and describing the “internalisation” of the cells is Morris
et al., 2013 rather than Anani et al., 2014 (page 11, line 428). The authors should consider
adding this reference in the text.
Upon reading the reviewers comment we carefully reread the paper of Morris et al. 2013 and
found that the references made to ‘internalisation’ specifically related to the timings of ICM-
founder cell internalisation (i.e. in the first or second waves of possible asymmetric cell division
at the 8- to 16-cell and 16- to 32-cell transitions, respectively) rather than the process of active
cell internalisation resulting some time after completion of cytokinesis. However, being familiar
with the previous work of this laboratory, we also re-consulted their earlier pioneering papers,
also utilising time-lapse imaging of embryos to derive detailed cell-lineage pedigrees (Bischoff
et al., 2008, Morris et al., 2010 and Parfitt and Zernicka-Goetz, 2010), to see if these mentioned
cell internalisation in the context referred to in the review and in Anani et al., 2014, but were
unable to uncover such a reference. As a consequence it seems inappropriate to make the
suggested change to the citation in the revised manuscript.
b. the authors stated that “the mitotic spindle orientation might be controlled by apically localised
factors”. In fact the results from Korotkevich et al. 2017 suggest that the apical domain size is
positively correlated with spindle orientation angle. Perhaps the authors would like to add this
information.
The reviewer makes a valid point and we have amended the main text of the resubmitted
manuscript to reflect this.
c. regarding the ratio of symmetric and asymmetric cell division, a recent publication suggests
that the cell-cell contact could negatively affect the asymmetric cell division, as in an intact
embryo where the cells subject to high level of cell-contact undergo higher frequency of
symmetric cell division (Humiecka et al., 2017). The authors would consider adding this
reference.
We have included the reference in an additional sentence highlighting this as a possibility. This
is included with comments relating to cell shape, as raised by reviewer number two.
3. Re-evaluating both the ‘positional’ and ’polarity’ models section
Although the authors correctly described the major findings in the references, the conflicts
between different publications were not sufficiently addressed or explained. For example, the
authors describe that the connection between apical components and trophectoderm (TE) cell
fate specification lies in the fact that Par complex inhibits hippo pathway by sequestering Amot.
However, the authors also cite the recent two publications in which one suggests Par complex
is insufficient to direct TE cell fate at 8-16 cell stage (Hirate et al., 2015) whereas apical domain
is sufficient to activate TE cell fate at the same stage (Korotkevich et al. 2017). It is important to
explain these two results as they might appear conflicting.
We are not completely sure to which passage of our article the reviewer is referring to when
they state above that ‘Par complex is insufficient to direct TE cell fate at 8-16 cell stage’ (citing
the work of Hirate et al., 2015). Indeed, we did not explicitly express any point in the manuscript
to mean the Par-complex is insufficient to direct TE cell-fate at this stage. Rather, as Hirate and
co-workers themselves state in their 2015 paper, there is a case to be made for an additional
mechanism of parallel Hippo-signalling repression in outer cells at this time-point (see line 586
in our originally submitted manuscript).
Indeed, the evidence for such an additional mechanism (as reported by Hirate et al., 2015) is
represented by the fact that the disruption of the Par complex (or in particular shPard6b-
mediated knockdown or overexpression of dominant negative aPKC/Prkci) is not sufficient to
completely exclude Yap1 from the nuclei at the 16-cell stage. This could be due to the existence
of a parallel mechanism, acting to functionally inhibit Amot (possibly anchored to the apical
domain) that is independent of apical polarity factors or due to insufficiently high levels of Amot
present at this stage to robustly activate Hippo signalling upon polarity disruption. However, as
we originally stated there is at present no forthcoming evidence to support either case.
Therefore, the results and conclusions contained within Hirate et al., 2015 are actually not in
conflict with those of Korotkevich et al., 2017. This is because the former argue that the loss of
apical polarity is alone insufficient to drive ICM cell fate at the 16-cell stage (but only temporally,
as such cells would ultimately internalise), whereas the latter state the acquisition of apical
polarity is sufficient to drive TE cell fate.
Therefore, we are reluctant to state that these two results are in conflict. However, we have
amended this paragraph to make it clear that the presence of cell contactless domains in outer
cells is not sufficient to provide outer cells with TE identity in the absence of apical polarity
factors. In so doing we think the text more clearly represents what we have described in our
response to this point above.
