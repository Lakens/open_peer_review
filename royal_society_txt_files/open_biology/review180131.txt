Comments - DNA methylation subpatterns at distinct regulatory regions in human early embryos
In the manuscript entitled “DNA methylation subpatterns at distinct regulatory regions in
human early embryos”, Rongsong Li et al., provides a high-resolution and global view of DNA
methylation sub-patterns in human early embryos based on published dataset. The study seems
somewhat interesting. However,
few of the key findings are beyond the current state of the art, and the manuscript seems to be
poorly checked and exists misinterpretations of the current data. The main comments are listed as
follows:
1. Page 6 and Figure 4, the author found that ‘DNA methylation of bins -4 to 6 were almost
completely hypo-methylated in all of the developmental stages’, while it turns out to be -3 to +5
bins that exhibit hypo-methylation according to Figure 4d. Besides, Figure 4c needs more
labelling.
2. Page 7, the author found that ‘a negative correlation between DNA methylation and gene
expression at the 3'UTR and a positive correlation between DNA methylation and gene
expression at the 5’UTR during all of the developmental stages’. While according to Figure 5a, the
results are just opposite.
3. Page 7, the author claimed that ‘DNA methylation of the exon and the intron correlated
positively with gene expression in the 2-cell, 4-cell, and 8-cell stages, and correlated negatively
with gene expression in the zygote, morula, ICM, and post-implantation stages’. However, the
correlations between DNA methylation level and gene expression are very weak from zygote to
morula stage. If without further exclusion of error deviation, the distinctions will be less
pervasive.
4. Page 7, the author found that ‘DNA methylation of bins -4 to 6 correlated negatively with gene
expression during all of the developmental stages, especially ICM and that DNA methylation of
the other bins also correlated negatively with gene expression (figure 5b)’. However, according to
Figure 5b, the other bins seem to be positively correlated with gene expression.
5. Page 7, the sentence of ‘A total of 363 genes with reduced DNA methylation levels showed
increased gene expression in the ICM stage until the post-implantation stage.’ is very confusing.
6. Page 8, the example seems to be needlessness. The author should put this part into
supplementary figure and add the CD81 gene locus information.
Minor concerns:
1. Language errors are everywhere in the manuscript, and strongly need to be carefully revised.
For example, page 4, the sentence of ‘The DNA methylation levels of the pre-implantation
3
embryos decreased from the zygote stage to the 2-cell stage, were relatively stable until the ICM
stage, and then dramatically increased post-implantation (figure 2b).’; page 5, ‘the numbers of
hyper-methylated genes was significantly higher in the post-implantation embryos’.
From my point of view, the current version of this manuscript should be re-organized to make a
fluent story.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
In this manuscript, Rongsong etal have analyzed the DNA methylation dynamics in genomic
subregions surround the Refseq gene or the promoter. The region 20kb upstream and
downstream of RefSeq genes was selected and divided into 12 regions, and the promoterregion
was further divided into 20 subregions. By analyzing previously published data, the authors have
found that the dynamics of DNA methylation at these genomicregions were nearly identical, and
DNA methylation of gene body regions correlated positively or negatively with gene expression.
They also suggested that the region 800bp upstream of the TSS to 1200bp downstream of the TSS
was the best candidate for the promoter region, and the subregion 200bp downstream of the TSS
was the putative key regulator of gene activity. The analysis of different region of "the gene" or
"the promoter" is interesting. However, more analysis should be performed to obtain deeper
biological insights.

Major comments:
1) The authors have analyzed the DNA methylome data of preimplantation embryos based on
different regions of "the gene" or "the promoter". However, novel insights are not clear. For
example, the authors found that " the dynamics of DNA methylation at these genomic regions
were nearly identical " and " the effects of the DNA methylation were region-specific " and "DNA
methylation of gene body regions correlated positively or negatively with gene expression".
These phenomenons have already been described in previous studies (Guo2014, Smith2014). The
authors should perform more compressive analysis to get deeper insights. I suggest that they
could make comparative analysis between the methylomes of adult tissues and the pre-
implantation embryos. Additionally, they could make comparative analysis between the DNA
methylation and chromatin of the pre-implantation embryos. Several genomic chromatin data
have been published recently. All these analysis can be based on the same different regions of
"the gene" and "the promoter" in the present study.
2) Relating to the comment 1), as the title "DNA methylation subpatterns at distinct regulatory
regions in human early embryos", the authors should try to make novel epigenomic insights into
the development of human early embryos.
3) The authors have identified differentially methylated genes based on promoter bin 1. How
about the differentially methylated genes identified by other promoter bins? Will the gene list be
different between these bins? Can the authors make a conclusion which bin is the best for
analysis in practical?
4) The author suggested that the region 800bp upstream of the TSS to 1200bp downstream of the
TSS was the best candidate for the promoter region based on the correlation between the gene
expression and DNA methylation. This is an interesting propose. The authors should expand this
part. The authors should integrate more data as suggested in comment 1) to see also the
situations in different adult tissues, as well as the chromatin of these regions. Also, the authors
should consider different subtypes of the promoter, including the low CpG and the high CpG
promoters. The authors should compare their conclusion with previous studies about the range
of the promoter.
5) Figure 4e. How was the " number of methylated bins" calculated? I do not understand why the
number of methylated bins is highest in center of the promoter?
Minor:
1) What is the “12 linear genomic regions”? The authors should decribe the definition in detail in
main text. It seems in Figure3a that these regions include exon, intron as a whole, then why called
them “linear”?
2) The authors should cite the reference origin of the analyzed data in the main text.

2nd Comments - DNA methylation subpatterns at distinct regulatory regions in human early
embryos
In the revised manuscript entitled “DNA methylation subpatterns at distinct regulatory regions
in human early embryos”, Rongsong Li et al., corrected several questions in their primary
submission. However, from my point of view, the manuscript still needs to be further polished
for the publication in the journal of Open Biology. They are as follows:
¬ For the GO analysis section, the sentence of ‘When compared to post-implantation embryos, a
total of 363 genes showed reduced DNA methylation along with increased gene expression in the
ICM of blastocyst.’ is still confusing. Does it mean these 363 genes are highly expressed in ICM
but lowly expressed in post-implantation embryos?
¬ In section 2.2, the last sentence has been changed into ‘When the methylation states of embryos
at any of the pre-implantation stages were compared to the post-implantation stage, 396 to 1130
genes changed from the hypo-methylated state to the hyper-methylated state, whereas only a few
genes changed from the hyper-methylated state to the hypo-methylated state (figure 2d).’ The
authors should explain the adjustment, and describe the relationship between 396 genes and the
363 genes for GO analysis.
¬ The abstract should be re-organized to make a precise and fluent description of the key
9
findings.
¬ Section 2.6 should be combined with the previous section. This is just an example, the current
content of section 2.6 is too weak to make an independent section.

Appendix A
We have read the valuable comments carefully, added some new data
and re-organized the manuscript. The point-to-point responds to the
reviewers' comments are as follows:
Response to Reviewer#1
Major Comments
Major Comment 1:
Page 6 and Figure 4, the author found that ‘DNA methylation of bins
-4 to 6 were almost completely hypo-methylated in all of the
developmental stages’, while it turns out to be -3 to +5 bins that
exhibit hypo-methylation according to Figure 4d. Besides, Figure 4c
needs more labeling.
Answer 1:
Thank you for your careful work. The "DNA methylation of bins -4 to
6 were almost completely hypo-methylated in all of the developmental
stages" was revised as "DNA methylation of bins -3 to 5 were
hypo-methylated in all the developmental stages" in the new version.
We also put more labels in Figure 4c.
Major comment 2:
Page 7, the author found that ‘a negative correlation between DNA
methylation and gene expression at the 3'UTR and a positive
correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression at the
5’UTR during all of the developmental stages’. While according to
Figure 5a, the results are just opposite.
Answer 2:
We feel deeply sorry about the mistake. The sentence was revised in
the new version.
Major comment 3:
Page 7, the author claimed that ‘DNA methylation of the exon and the
intron correlated positively with gene expression in the 2-cell, 4-cell,
and 8-cell stages, and correlated negatively with gene expression in the
zygote, morula, ICM, and post-implantation stages’. However, the
correlations between DNA methylation level and gene expression are
very weak from zygote to morula stage. If without further exclusion of
error deviation, the distinctions will be less pervasive.
Answer 3: Thank you for your instructive suggestion. We recalculated
the correlations between DNA methylation level and gene expression
and analyzed the significance test of correlation (p-value). For the
exon and intron, although the correlations between DNA methylation
and gene expression are very weak from zygote to morula stages, but
the correlation tests are significant (p<0.05). As the weak correlation
from zygote to morula stages, we revised the text as follows: "DNA
methylation of the exon and the intron positively correlated with gene
expression in the 2-cell, 4-cell, and 8-cell stages, and negatively
correlated with gene expression in the zygote, morula, ICM, and
post-implantation stages. It was noteworthy that the correlations are
weak from zygote to morula stages".
Major comment 4:
Page 7, the author found that ‘DNA methylation of bins -4 to 6
correlated negatively with gene expression during all of the
developmental stages, especially ICM and that DNA methylation of
the other bins also correlated negatively with gene expression (figure
5b)’. However, according to Figure 5b, the other bins seem to be
positively correlated with gene expression.
Answer 4: We are sorry for not describing this part clearly. According
to the correlation coefficients and the detection of significant
correlation (p<0.05), the DNA methylation of bins -4 to 6 negatively
correlated with gene expression in all the developmental stages. We
have been rewritten this part and added the correlation tests in
supplementary in the new version.
Major comment 5:
Page 7, the sentence of ‘A total of 363 genes with reduced DNA
methylation levels showed increased gene expression in the ICM stage
until the post-implantation stage.’ is very confusing.
Answer 5: The sentence was revised as “When compared to
post-implantation embryos, a total of 363 genes showed reduced DNA
methylation with increased gene expression in the ICM of blastocyst.”
Major comment 6:
Page 8, the example seems to be needlessness. The author should put
this part into supplementary figure and add the CD81 gene locus
information.
Answer 6:
We accept the comment and put this part into supplementary figures
and also added the CD81 gene locus information.
Minor concerns:
1. Language errors are everywhere in the manuscript, and strongly
need to be carefully revised. For example, page 4, the sentence of ‘The
DNA methylation levels of the pre-implantation embryos decreased
from the zygote stage to the 2-cell stage, were relatively stable until
the ICM stage, and then dramatically increased post-implantation
(figure 2b).’; page 5, ‘the numbers of hyper-methylated genes was
significantly higher in the post-implantation embryos’.
From my point of view, the current version of this manuscript should
be re-organized to make a fluent story.
Answer: We are sorry for the language mistake. We have carefully
corrected the phrases throughout the manuscript and re-organized the
manuscript according to reviewer's comments.
Response to Reviewer#2 Major Comments
Major comments:
Major comment 1:
1) The authors have analyzed the DNA methylome data of
preimplantation embryos based on different regions of "the gene" or
"the promoter". However, novel insights are not clear. For example,
the authors found that "the dynamics of DNA methylation at these
genomic regions were nearly identical." and "the effects of the DNA
methylation were region-specific" and "DNA methylation of gene
body regions correlated positively or negatively with gene expression".
These phenomenons have already been described in previous studies
(Guo2014, Smith2014). The authors should perform more compressive
analysis to get deeper insights. I suggest that they could make
comparative analysis between the methylomes of adult tissues and the
pre-implantation embryos. Additionally, they could make comparative
analysis between the DNA methylation and chromatin of the
pre-implantation embryos. Several genomic chromatin data have been
published recently. All these analysis can be based on the same
different regions of "the gene" and "the promoter" in the present study.
Answer 1:
1) Thank you for your valuable advice. Previous researches showed
that large losses of DNA methylation occur immediately after
fertilization in most parts of the human genome, confirming that the
epigenetic reprogramming is an evolutionarily conserved
developmental trait. Guo et al. have mapped the DNA methylation
landscape of human early embryos and provides a framework for the
comprehensive analysis of the DNA methylation regulation network.
In this study, researchers focus on the DNA methylation of gene body
and DNA elements such LINE, SINE, LTR, and the promoter region.
Smith et al. obtained similar DNA methylation patterns during several
developmental stages of human embryonic formation and during the
derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines. The two studies
allowed us to understand the differences between mouse and human
methylation dynamics and the functional relationship between DNA
methylation and gene expression and transposable elements [1, 2]. In
our study, the region staring from upstream 20kb to downstream 20kb
of RefSeq gene was selected and divided into 12 distinct regions, and
the promoter region was further divided into 20 subregions. A
high-resolution of DNA methylation at these genomic regions was
systematically analyzed along with their effects on gene expression.
We re-organized our results and make some novel insights, for
example:
a) DNA methylation in the gene body is not incompletely positive
correlation with gene expression. DNA methylation of the exon and
intron were weak positive correlation with gene expression in the
2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and negative correlation with gene expression in
the zygote, and from morula to post-implantation stages. Only 3'UTR
methylation positively correlated with gene expression in the all
developmental stages.
b) For the 20 bins of promoter region, the CpG density showed a
normal distribution pattern and the DNA methylation level inverse
relationship with the CpG density.
c) The DNA methylation of the bins -4 to 6 negatively correlated
with gene expression at all the developmental stages. Furthermore, we
concluded that the bin 1 is best candidate region for practical analysis
of other researchers.
2) Relating to the major comment 4: we accepted the reviewer's
suggestion and conducted the comparative analysis between different
tissues and pre-implantation.
3) Recently, several genomic chromatin researches for mammalian
early embryo development have been published [3-5]. Gao. et al.
mapped the chromatin accessibility landscape in human early embryos
for the first time, from the perspective of development and evolution to
understand human chromatin in human early embryonic development.
In this study, the researchers analyzed the correlations between DHSs
and DNA methylation, the results showed that high CpG promoter
regions tend to establish DHSs in early development stage, whereas
just opposite in the low CpG promoter regions [6]. It’s a very good
advice from the reviewer to conduct the comparative analysis between
the DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility based on the same
different genomic regions of "the gene" and "the promoter".
Considering the time and energy, we will conduct the integrated
analysis between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in our
future work and expect new discoveries. Moreover, we have added this
part (chromatin accessibly) in discussion in the new version. Thank
you again for the instructive suggestions.
Major comment 2:
Relating to the comment 1), as the title "DNA methylation subpatterns
at distinct regulatory regions in human early embryos", the authors
should try to make novel epigenomic insights into the development of
human early embryos.
Answer 2: Thank you for your instructive suggestion. In our study, we
first systematically analyzed the DNA methylation dynamics at
different genomic subregions surround the Refseq genes, gene body
and promoters, and provide a view of high-resolution DNA
methylation subpattern in human early embryos. We gained several
novel epigenetic insights into the development of human early
embryos, for example:
a) DNA methylation of gene body was incompletely positively
correlated with gene expression. 3'UTR methylation is a feature of
transcribed genes.
b) CpG density of promoter subregions showed a normal
distribution pattern and inverse relationship with DNA methylation
levels.
c) The region upstream 800bp and downstream 1200bp of the TSS
is the best candidate promoter region, and the subregion downstream
200bp of TSS is a key region for regulating gene expression.
The detailed information for the insight into the DNA methylation
subpattern has been added in the new version.
Major comment 3:
The authors have identified differentially methylated genes based on
promoter bin 1. How about the differentially methylated genes
identified by other promoter bins? Will the gene list be different
between these bins? Can the authors make a conclusion which bin is
the best for analysis in practical?
Answer 3: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. In present study, the
TSS ± 2kb of Refseq gene was selected and regarded it as promoter
region, and subdivided into 20 consecutive bins. The CpG density and
DNA methylation for each bin were calculated. Moreover, the
correlation analysis between DNA methylation of each bin and gene
expression also analyzed. Data shows that the bin 1 had the highest
CpG density and the lower DNA methylation level, and its DNA
methylation level negatively correlated with gene expression in all the
developmental stages. Thus, bin 1 was selected for further analysis and
conducted the GO analysis with the differentially methylated genes
identified by the bin 1. These genes were enriched for terms associated
with cell proliferation and differentiation which could better reflect the
transition from pre-implantation to post-implantation. Based on these
results, we believe bin1 (downstream 200bp of the TSS) was the
critical bin in promoter region, which will be the best for analysis in
practical.
Major comment 4:
The author suggested that the region 800bp upstream of the TSS to
1200bp downstream of the TSS was the best candidate for the
promoter region based on the correlation between the gene expression
and DNA methylation. This is an interesting propose. The authors
should expand this part. The authors should integrate more data as
suggested in comment 1) to see also the situations in different adult
tissues, as well as the chromatin of these regions. Also, the authors
should consider different subtypes of the promoter, including the low
CpG and the high CpG promoters. The authors should compare their
conclusion with previous studies about the range of the promoter.
Answer 4: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have
integrated the DNA methylation datasets and gene expression of
different tissues (somatic cell at 7-week, 10-week, 19-week, PGC at
11-week) for comparative analysis. Data showed the situation that the
region upstream 800bp to downstream 1200bp of the TSS is the best
candidate promoter region is suitable for early embryos but not so
suitable for somatic tissues. The related results have been added in
supplementary materials in the new version.
Previous studies have analyzed the different subtypes of promoter in
human early embryos, including the low CpG and high CpG promoters
[1-2, 7-8]. In our study, we divided promoter region into 20 bins for
further analysis, including the DNA methylation and the CpG density
(high CpG, intermediate CpG, and low CpG) for each bin. In the new
version, we reorganized these results and added them in supplementary
materials. Besides, the range of promoter region was discussed in
discussion section in the new version.
Major comment 5:
Figure 4e. How was the "number of methylated bins" calculated? I do
not understand why the number of methylated bins is highest in center
of the promoter?
Answer 5: We are sorry we didn't make it clear. The phrase "number
of methylated bins" should be "number of genes which have
methylated CpGs in a certain bin". We have changed the phrase in the
new version. We have calculated the CpG density for all the bins, and
the bins at the center of the promoter (around TSS) had the highest
CpG density, which means these bins may have the highest possibility
to have methylated CpGs. Our results proved this speculation, that the
"number of genes which have methylated CpGs in a certain bin" were
highest in those bins in the center of the promoter region.
Minor concerns:
Minor concern 1:
What is the “12 linear genomic regions”? The authors should describe
the definition in detail in main text. It seems in Figure3a that these
regions include exon, intron as a whole, then why called them
“linear”?
Answer 1: Thanks for your careful work. The phrase “12 linear
genomic regions” will make reader confused, so we changed it into
“12 genomic regions” as demonstrated in Figure 1.
Minor concern 2:
The authors should cite the reference origin of the analyzed data in the
main text.
Answer 2: We have cited the reference origin of the analyzed data
suggested by the reviewer in the revised manuscript.
Finally, we appreciate very much for you time in editing our
manuscript and the reviewers for their valuable suggestions and
comments.
