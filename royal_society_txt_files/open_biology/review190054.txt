Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The authors developed a database named EmExplorer for exploring time activation of gene
expression in mammalian embryos, which incorporates over 26000 genes obtained from 306
functional pathways in 5 species. With the multiple analysis tools and visualization options, the
EmExplorer database might be helpful for elucidating the early developmental mechanism, and
exploring time activation genes.
Since the EmExplorer maybe the first web on temporal expression of development-related genes
for mammalian embryos, it’s better provide some example for key genes in EmExplorer as well as
in related references, to confirm the precise of the information in EmExplorer.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
3
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
4
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
The Open Biology Team

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to submit a revised manuscript (Title: EmExplorer:
A database for exploring time activation of gene expression in mammalian embryos) to the “Open
Biology” for publication. We appreciate your positive comments. We also appreciate all reviewers for
their constructive comments, which helped us to improve our manuscript. The detailed description
response to reviewers and changes are enclosed below, with the reviewers’ comments reproduced in
italics.
All references have been rearranged in the revised manuscript. With these improvements, we hope that
the manuscript is suitable for publication. We believe that EmExplorer can help researchers understand
the timing expression of specific genes in each developmental stage, which may give the biologists a
certain inspiration and enable them to carry out further studies in cell reprograming or embryo
development.
Please let us know if there are any other questions. We would be very pleased to try our best to further
improve our manuscript.
Thank you and best regards.
Yours sincerely,
Ph.D. YongchunZuo

Response: Thank you for your positive comments. In order to verify the accuracy in EmExplorer, we
selected the pluripotency factors POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG, which are key roles in embryonic
development and are hotspots of current research. In addition, we also used the BMP4 that determines
cell fate together with POU5F1. Through the multi-gene analysis tool, we found consistent conclusions
with the literature and observed differences in expression pattern in different species. This means
EmExplorer is able to give researchers the right insight based on existing data, and greatly helping
users understand the similarity or difference across diverse animals. All of the discussion of key genes
has been added in the revision MS and the necessary references have been rearranged.
