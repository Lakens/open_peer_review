label_comment_1
In this manuscript Lie and colleagues describe results from global quantitative fitness analysis
(QFA) on a non-essential gene deletion library of fission yeast to probe for genes whose deletion
alters cell fitness in poor nutrient conditions or when TORC1/2 signalling is repressed by a
chemical inhibitor. This revealed a fairly large number of genes whose products are involved in a
wide range of metabolic processes, transcription, chromatin organisation and autophagy, to name
but a few. There is very little to say about this work other than the screens appear to have been
well executed and the manuscript is presented and well written, the results are very clear and so
should provide a useful resource for researchers in the field.

Lie et al. present data from various carefully executed S. pombe genome wide deletion library
screens, in rich media and in minimal media with varying nitrogen sources, and after exposure to
the TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor Torin1. These screens identified a large number of mutants which
show increased or decreased growth compared to WT. The screen is validated by the detection of
several mutants (described in line 186) which have previously been associated with regulation of
the TOR pathway.
Over-representation of the ontology groups “chromatin organization and transcription”, “trans-
membrane transport”, “autophagy” and “nucleocytoplasmic transport”, which as discussed in
the manuscript have previously been linked to TOR activity, also validate the screen.
The main value of this manuscript is the identification of many novel genes, with known and
unknown functions, which are implicated in nutrient/TOR signalling for the first time; this will
be of interest to many scientists working in the fields of TOR and nutrient signalling in various
organisms and will guide a range of future studies.
The manuscript can be improved by providing a more thorough analysis of (some of) the
identified genes which have not previously been implicated in TOR/nutrient signalling. Maybe
concentrate on some genes/mutants which are conserved in humans and show the strongest
growth effects?
Minor comments:
131: looking at the figures provided in the manuscript I don’t think that “estimated colony size”
is used to quantify growth. I assume it also involves a measurement of integrated density?
Figure 4b: It is somewhat surprising that no colonies are seen in the WT strains treated with
DMSO in the two higher dilutions. Coiuld this reflect an error in the dilution series?

We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0015 entitled "The contribution of
non-essential Schizosaccharomyces pombe genes to fitness in response to altered nutrient supply
and Target of Rapamycin activity." has been accepted by the Editor for publication in Open
Biology. The reviewer(s) have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor revisions
to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments and revise
your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
5
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
The Open Biology Team

Editor's comment:
Please address all the referees' comments. Although some are quite extensive, I believe these can
be addressed through revisions to the manuscript without necessitating any further
experimentation.

when TOR signaling has been reduced by Torin1, this have now been included in the new Table 5.
comments:
oking at the figures provided in the manuscript I don’t think that “estimated colony size” is used to
y growth. I assume it also involves a measurement of integrated density?
nk the referee for this comment.
zer data could best be described as colony density estimates since it does take into account the opacity
ony as well as its dimensions. Opacity is determined by colony size in growth away from the agar, so
olony on agar grows thicker, the true colour of the microorganism becomes apparent against the
ound of the agar.
e therefore changed "size" to "density" in the below sentence.
etermine the fitness of individual spotted yeast strains, estimated colony “size” (now chanced to
y) for each strain was calculated by image processing using Colonyzer software.”
4b: It is somewhat surprising that no colonies are seen in the WT strains treated with DMSO in the
gher dilutions. Coiuld this reflect an error in the dilution series?
as due to a spotting/pipetting error; we have replaced the photo, with another wt control on DMSO
