This is an excellent review of the input layer of the Torso signaling pathway, written by the
leading experts in this system. The authors discuss recent progress in understanding the
processes of active ligand generation, bringing together new connections with the membrane
attack pore forming complexes, experiments with the Torso/Trunk/Tsl like system in cultured
cells, and studies of postembryonic effects of Torso activation by PTTH. The review is written in a
very thoughtful way and makes an interesting read for anyone interested in problems at the
intersections of biochemistry, cell biology, development. I suggest that the authors cite a recent
review by Goyal et al (Developmental Biology, 2018), which focuses on the processes
downstream of active Torso and a structural study by Daryl Klen (Molecular Cell, 2015).
Otherwise the paper is good to go. I would include a better schematic for postembryonic
signaling.

This review article by Mineo et al. aims to cover the different contexts in which the Torso receptor
tyrosine kinase has been shown to play a role in Drosophila, and how it might be activated in
these contexts. The senior authors group has made seminal contributions to the study of the best
known role of Torso, where it is locally activated at the embryo termini and controls terminal
patterning.
Mineo et al first cover what is known about how Torso activity is restricted to the termini,
including some quite recent studies from themselves and others. This coverage is comprehensive
and care is taken to acknowledge all studies and their strengths and weaknesses. I would suggest,
however, that the quite low penetrance of the rescue phenotypes observed in the Mineo et al 2018
Genetics paper should be mentioned to ensure that for this study this caveat is mentioned (as
they have done for other studies).
The sections on other roles of Torso and how it is activated, and why there might be a need for a
second ligand, are not as well written. The study by Jun et al (2016) showing a role for Tor in the
fat body is mentioned, but what ligand is used in this context is not mentioned (even if not
known, this should be stated.). Overall I was not left with a clear sense of what the authors think
regarding why there are two different ligands for Tor and why Trk is used in one context and
Ptth in another, and why different mechanisms for controlling the activity of these ligands might
exist. The final two sections (“complexity from simplicity” and “two ligands, two functions”) are
aimed at addressing these questions, but do not give a clear picture. On p10 line 5 they say that a
picture emerges of an initially simpler mechanism where a ligand can always activate the
receptor. However no evidence for the existence of this is presented. The review is also missing a
discussion of the way forward and what remains to be discovered. Clarity on these questions
would markedly improve this review and ensure it is useful for a non specialist.
Throughout the manuscript there are numerous grammatical issues in need of attention, and
some sentences/sections with missing references. These all need addressing. Also, nowhere at the
start does it state this is all in Drosophila!

appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:

authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].

This review article by Mineo et al. aims to cover the different contexts
in which the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to play a
role in Drosophila, and how it might be activated in these contexts.
The senior authors group has made seminal contributions to the study
of the best known role of Torso, where it is locally activated at the
embryo termini and controls terminal patterning.
Mineo et al first cover what is known about how Torso activity is
restricted to the termini, including some quite recent studies from
themselves and others. This coverage is comprehensive and care is
taken to acknowledge all studies and their strengths and weaknesses.
I would suggest, however, that the quite low penetrance of the rescue
phenotypes observed in the Mineo et al 2018 Genetics paper should
be mentioned to ensure that for this study this caveat is mentioned
(as they have done for other studies).
We are also pleased by the overall positive appreciation of the referee
and have followed his/her suggestions. In this regard we mention the
quite low penetrance of the phenotypes observed in the Mineo et al
2018 Genetics paper.
The sections on other roles of Torso and how it is activated, and why
there might be a need for a second ligand, are not as well written. The
study by Jun et al (2016) showing a role for Tor in the fat body is
mentioned, but what ligand is used in this context is not mentioned
(even if not known, this should be stated.).
We did mention that it is not know what ligand is used in the fat body in
the legend to figure 2 in the original manuscript. We now also mention
it in the main text in the new version.
Overall I was not left with a clear sense of what the authors think
regarding why there are two different ligands for Tor and why Trk is
used in one context and Ptth in another, and why different
mechanisms for controlling the activity of these ligands might exist.
The final two sections (“complexity from simplicity” and “two ligands,
two functions”) are aimed at addressing these questions, but do not
give a clear picture.
We agree with the referee. We think we can not answer this why
question (if such an answer does exist!). We comment what might
account for this diversity although, in our opinion, there is no a clear
explanation accounting for this fact. This is probably the reason not to
be able to give a clear picture: we present and discuss the known facts
but in our view there is probably not a definitive conclusion.
On p10 line 5 they say that a picture emerges of an initially simpler
mechanism where a ligand can always activate the receptor. However
no evidence for the existence of this is presented.
We have modified the sentence along the line suggested by the referee.
The review is also missing a discussion of the way forward and what
remains to be discovered. Clarity on these questions would markedly
improve this review and ensure it is useful for a non specialist.
Our manuscript included already a specific box on Outstanding
questions. We now mention this box in the main text.
Throughout the manuscript there are numerous grammatical issues in
need of attention, and some sentences/sections with missing
references. These all need addressing.
The person in charge of proofreading at the Institute, who is an English
professional, reviewed the initial manuscript. We have also added some
references but we think that the comment from the reviewer might be
motivated because, in the case that the content of the different
sentences in a section might be attributed to the same set of original
papers, we chose to include those references at the end of the section
instead of after each sentence.
Also, nowhere at the start does it state this is all in Drosophila!
We now state in the first page that the Torso pathway is a pathway in
Drosophila.
