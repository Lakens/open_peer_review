This manuscript presents an investigation into Tn5 transposase targetting on defined
dinucleosomal templates. It links the high quality nucleosome preparation skills of the
Kurumizaka laboratory to create a substrate for analysis of in vitro Tn5 attack on nucleosomes
with a next generation sequencing readout.
The methods and results of this study are clear and well-described. The title could be slightly
edited to "Biochemical analysis of nucleosome targeting by Tn5 transposase" to better reflect the
nature of the work.
However, the depth of interpretation provided is very weak and shoudl make more effort to
address the question of dependence of Tn5 site specificity on DNA sequence versus nucleosome
structure. This is very important because the extreme bias the authors report of incorporation at
only 1-3 sites impacts strongly on broader use and interpretation of ATAC-seq experiments.
Firstly, the relative enhancement/protection by the histone octamer is highly relevant to the
interpretation. DNA sequence preferences of Tn5 on free DNA have been published and the
authors probably have NGS data for the free DNA substrates they show. Inspection of free DNA
bands in figures 1C and 3B suggests that the sites identified as targets with the nucleosome
substrate may already be strongly prefered in free DNA. A more detailed analysis could also
incorporate data from S. cerevisiae mapping by the Greenleaf group.
A related aspect is the spread of incorporation. Figure 1E and the text seems to imply that Tn5
insertion is a single base sites, whereas figure 1D appears shows spread over at least 3 bases on
601-15, and figure 4 shows even more spread on 603. A more detailed description of this is
needed.
Secondly, more detailed structural consideration should be included. Since the structure of the
601 containing nucleosome and Tn5 transposase are known, it is reasonable to provide a simple
docking schematic to assess the geometry and spatial features observed. The relevance of the co-
crystal structure of a nucleosome with prototype foamy virus integrase should be discussed, but
has not even been cited. Such a discussion does not need to overshadow the impact of a
nucleosome-Tn5 structure that the authors may be attempting to determine.
One smaller issue is over-referencing in blocks of citations: Of the 65 total references, 58 (89%) are
cited in the Introduction. On page 2 line 26 there is a block of 13 references for genome-wide
nucleosome mapping, on page 3 line 1 there are 4 references for generic genome functionality, on
page 3 line 9 there are 5 references for DNaseI mapping, and on page 4 line 15 there are 5 + 12
3
references for applications of ATAC-seq. In total, these 4 blocks have 39 citations accounting for
60% of all references. With due respect to the cited primary research, many of these references
could be subsumed by citing a summary review and a few key primary papers.
There do not seem to be any figure legends for the supplementary figures.

Tn5 transposase has been widely used for the mapping of accessible chromatin regions, which are
usually the transcription binding sites. However, little attention has been paid on the effect of
nucleosome/chromatin structure on the integration of Tn5. In the manuscript titled as
“Biochemical analysis of chromatin targeting by Tn5 transposase”, the authors explicitly analyzed
the effects of in vitro assembled di-nucleosomes with different linker length on the integration of
Tn5. They found that Tn5 transposase minimally cleaved the di-nucleosome without a linker
DNA and Tn5 transposase preferentially targets near the entry-exit sites of the proximal
nucleosomal DNA. In addition to the entry-exit sites of the nucleosome, Tn5 transposase would
additionally target the middle of the linker DNA when the linker length of di-nucleosome
extended to 30 bp. In conclusion, this study provides useful insights into the mechanisms by
which nucleosomes affect Tn5 integration. However, several concerns need to be addressed
before this manuscript could be accepted for publication.

Major concerns:
1. The authors observed preferential integration of Tn5 at the entry-exit site of proximal 601-
nucleosomes of the di-nucleosome. The authors did not specify the linker sequences used in this
study, although they changed the nucleosomal DNA sequence from 601 to 603 DNA. A linker
with palindromic sequence can be used to test the effect of DNA sequence on the preferential
digestion of Tn5.
2. The authors used di-nucleosomes without outer linker in this study. However, as the entry and
exit site of nucleosomal DNA are asymmetric on the di-nucleosome, especially when considering
steric hindrance of nucleosomes, they would show different effects on the integration of Tn5. This
is especially interesting when considering one nucleosome adjacent to a nucleosome –free region
in vivo. Thus, the authors should analysis the integration pattern of Tn5 on di-nucleosomes with
different length of outer linker DNA. Alternatively, the authors can performed Tn5 integration
experiments on mononucleosomal template with different lenght of linker DNAs.
3. At Page 13 of 26, the method “4.5. Sequence analysis”, the authors stated that “The resulting
DNA fragments were purified to exclude fragments shorter than 150 base-pairs” after the second
adaptor ligation. Thus, it is possibly that fragments with cutting sites inside the nucleosome be
left out. Alicia N. Schep et al. (Genome Research, 2015) has reported that Tn5 could cut into the
nucleosome. Thus, it is important to retain this information to compare the cutting efficiency
inside and outside of nucleosome. Moreover, Alicia N. Schep et al observed periodicity of Tn5
integration at the boundary of the nucleosome, which is different from the reported specific
integration at the entry-exit site the nucleosome. It’s possibly that the integration pattern of Tn5
on the nucleosome would depend on the extend of digestion. Thus, it would be important to
sequence fragments from different digestion extend. Besides, the authors did not point out the
digestion condition they performed sequencing on.
Minor concerns:
1. In Page 9 of 26, the authors stated “Nucleosome formation induces DNA negative supercoiling,
and may assist the Tn5 transposase integration at specific nucleosome sites, as observed in the
present study”. It is possibly true that the negative supercoiling induced by nucleosome assembly
may affect Tn5 transposase integration in vivo. However, it is hardly the case observed in this
study, since the di-nucleosomes used in this study are assembled with linear DNA as described in
methods “4.1. Preparation of dinucleosomes”. To test the effect of DNA supercoiling on the
integration of Tn5, circular plasmid DNA could be used for nucleosome assembly.

Comment)
The methods and results of this study are clear and well-described. The title could be
slightly edited to "Biochemical analysis of nucleosome targeting by Tn5 transposase" to
better reflect the nature of the work.
Reply)
Thank you for this suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we changed the title to
"Biochemical analysis of nucleosome targeting by Tn5 transposase".
Comment)
Firstly, the relative enhancement/protection by the histone octamer is highly relevant to
the interpretation. DNA sequence preferences of Tn5 on free DNA have been published
and the authors probably have NGS data for the free DNA substrates they show.
Inspection of free DNA bands in figures 1C and 3B suggests that the sites identified as
targets with the nucleosome substrate may already be strongly prefered in free DNA. A
more detailed analysis could also incorporate data from S. cerevisiae mapping by the
Greenleaf group.
Reply)
Thank you very much for this insightful comment. According to this reviewer’s
comment, we have added the NGS data for the free DNA substrates in the new
Supplementary Table S1. In the presence of the free DNA substrates, many target sites
of Tn5 could not be annotated on a single location, because of the tandemly repetitive
sequences for the dinucleosome template DNAs. In contrast, nucleosome formation
masked the target sites in a nucleosome. This technical problem makes it difficult to
provide an accurate graphical representation for the target sites in free DNAs. Therefore,
we have listed the top five cleavage sites (highest counts in the NGS analysis) for the
free DNAs in Supplementary Table S1. In the presence of the 601 dinucleosome
substrate, the 5´-140 base position (upper strand) was one of the major target sites for
Tn5 transposase. This site was also observed as one of the major target sites for Tn5
transposase in the free DNA substrate, as listed in Supplementary Table S1, suggesting
that the 140 base position appears to be a preferred sequence for Tn5 transposase. This
fact does not affect our conclusion, because this is not the case in the experiments with
the 603 DNA sequence. In the revised manuscript, we added a description of these facts
in the results section (p.7, ll.2-5), and intensively discussed this point in the discussion
section (p.8, l.24-p.9, l.3).
Comment)
A related aspect is the spread of incorporation. Figure 1E and the text seems to imply
that Tn5 insertion is a single base sites, whereas figure 1D appears shows spread over
at least 3 bases on 601-15, and figure 4 shows even more spread on 603. A more
detailed description of this is needed.
Reply)
In the revised manuscript, we listed the detailed cleavage sites of the 601-15, 601-30,
603-15, and 603-30 dinucleosome substrates in Supplementary Table S1.
Comment)
Secondly, more detailed structural consideration should be included. Since the structure
of the 601 containing nucleosome and Tn5 transposase are known, it is reasonable to
provide a simple docking schematic to assess the geometry and spatial features
observed. The relevance of the co-crystal structure of a nucleosome with prototype
foamy virus integrase should be discussed, but has not even been cited. Such a
discussion does not need to overshadow the impact of a nucleosome-Tn5 structure that
the authors may be attempting to determine.
Reply)
As this reviewer suggested, in the revised manuscript, we have cited the published
report for a prototype foamy virus integrase complexed with a nucleosome (Maskell et
al., Nature 2015), and discussed the integration mechanism of the presumed binding
sites of Tn5 and the foamy virus integrase in the revised manuscript (p.10, ll.14-22).

One smaller issue is over-referencing in blocks of citations: Of the 65 total references,

could be subsumed by citing a summary review and a few key primary papers.

Comment)
The authors observed preferential integration of Tn5 at the entry-exit site of proximal
601-nucleosomes of the di-nucleosome. The authors did not specify the linker sequences
used in this study, although they changed the nucleosomal DNA sequence from 601 to
603 DNA. A linker with palindromic sequence can be used to test the effect of DNA
sequence on the preferential digestion of Tn5.
Reply)
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have presented the DNA sequences for the
dinucleosome substrates used in this study in Supplementary Fig. S4.
Comment)
The authors used di-nucleosomes without outer linker in this study. However, as the
entry and exit site of nucleosomal DNA are asymmetric on the di-nucleosome,
especially when considering steric hindrance of nucleosomes, they would show different
effects on the integration of Tn5. This is especially interesting when considering one
nucleosome adjacent to a nucleosome –free region in vivo. Thus, the authors should
analysis the integration pattern of Tn5 on di-nucleosomes with different length of outer
linker DNA. Alternatively, the authors can performed Tn5 integration experiments on
mononucleosomal template with different lenght of linker DNAs.
Reply)
We appreciate this referee’s comment. In this study, we focused on the effect of the
linker DNA between two nucleosomes on the integration reaction. Therefore, the
question of how the outer linker DNAs affect the integration reaction by Tn5
transposase in chromatin is beyond the scope of the present research. We will study this
referee’s point, as an interesting future topic.
Comment)
At Page 13 of 26, the method “4.5. Sequence analysis”, the authors stated that “The
resulting DNA fragments were purified to exclude fragments shorter than 150
base-pairs” after the second adaptor ligation. Thus, it is possibly that fragments with
cutting sites inside the nucleosome be left out. Alicia N. Schep et al. (Genome Research,
2015) has reported that Tn5 could cut into the nucleosome. Thus, it is important to
retain this information to compare the cutting efficiency inside and outside of
nucleosome.
Reply)
As shown in the gel-based analysis of the dinucleosome substrates with a 15 base-pair
linker DNA, the transposase reaction by the Tn5-DNA complex results in two distinct
DNA fragments, indicating that Tn5 transposase cleaved the dinucleosomes at a single
site (Figures 1C, 2B, and 3B). Therefore, the cleavage site can be mapped by a sequence
analysis with only the longer DNA. Our mapping data are consistent with the previous
genomics study reported by Schep et al. (Genome Research, 2015).
Comment)
Moreover, Alicia N. Schep et al observed periodicity of Tn5 integration at the boundary
of the nucleosome, which is different from the reported specific integration at the
entry-exit site the nucleosome. It’s possibly that the integration pattern of Tn5 on the
nucleosome would depend on the extend of digestion. Thus, it would be important to
sequence fragments from different digestion extend. Besides, the authors did not point
out the digestion condition they performed sequencing on.
Reply)
When the dinucleosome was treated with the Tn5-DNA complex for longer times (for
example, 45 min and 90 min, Figure 1C lanes 10-12), we observed the weak but clear
periodic digestion pattern on the non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. These fragments
may be products corresponding to the periodic digests by Tn5 transposase, as previously
reported by Schep et al. This point is described in the revised manuscript (p.5, ll.14-17).
Minor concerns:
Comment)
In Page 9 of 26, the authors stated “Nucleosome formation induces DNA negative
supercoiling, and may assist the Tn5 transposase integration at specific nucleosome
sites, as observed in the present study”. It is possibly true that the negative supercoiling
induced by nucleosome assembly may affect Tn5 transposase integration in vivo.
However, it is hardly the case observed in this study, since the di-nucleosomes used in
this study are assembled with linear DNA as described in methods “4.1. Preparation of
dinucleosomes”. To test the effect of DNA supercoiling on the integration of Tn5,
circular plasmid DNA could be used for nucleosome assembly.
Reply)
Thank you very much. According to this reviewer’s suggestion, in the revised
manuscript, we removed the related paragraph discussing the DNA supercoiling in the
discussion section.
