This is a very good and thoughtful review of events that occur during replication stress, leading
to utilisation of the MiDAS salvage pathway. It will be of value to many workers in he
replication/repair and telomere fields. Aside from the scientific content, which is first-rate, I
cannot even find a single typo in the manuscript. I therefore suggest that you publish the work
with immediate effect!

Appendix A
The manuscript entitled, “Pathways for maintenance of telomeres and common
fragile sites during DNA replication stress” by Özer and Hickson reviews the current
state of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying mitotic DNA repair
synthesis (MiDAS) and maintenance of common fragile sites and telomeres. As
cellular responses to DNA replication stress play critical roles in maintaining
genome stability and oncogene activation is one important source of chronic
replication stress, this is a timely review of an important topic that is of interest to a
broad audience. The selected topics discussed in the review address many of the
areas relevant to replication stress and MiDAS. The authors also provide a
thoughtful discussion of the remaining gaps in knowledge and potential clinical
implications for targeting MiDAS as an anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.
One concern is that the review is quite abbreviated and is indeed shorter in length
than many similar review articles published in Open Biology. In this regard, many of
the key concepts are discussed in a cursory manner and lack adequate description
of supporting evidence in the primary literature, which renders the review less
accessible to a wide spectrum of readers outside of the field. Overall, the document
would significantly benefit from a more in-depth summary of the topics. Some
examples of areas that warrant additional discussion are listed below.
1. Oncogene induced DNA replication stress. The ability of oncogenes to induce the
slowing and/or stalling of replication forks and the ‘tolerance’ of cancer cells to DNA
replication stress are concepts that are centrally important to the review. The
authors should provide a more thorough discussion/summary of the growing body
of literature that has led to mechanistic insights into the causes of oncogene induced
replication stress as well as the evidence for replication stress in cancers.
2. Common fragile sites. The causes of differential CFS expression in distinct
tissue/cell types are briefly discussed. Specific information about what is known
about the ‘altered density of active replication origins and chromatin structure’
would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying fragility in
different cell types. It is also mentioned that ‘CFSs are evolutionarily conserved’.
How far does the evolutionary conservation extend? What organisms harbor CFSs?
What is conserved—genomic locations? Gene structures?
3. BIR. Break-induced replication (BIR) is discussed in several subsections as a
putative mechanism for repair of collapsed forks. For readers who are unfamiliar
with this mechanism, a more detailed explanation of this process and the
recombination outcomes would provide clarification for these points.
4. Figures. Some additional figures or diagrams depicting the relevant processes
and pathways would be useful, e.g., BIR, normal and break-induced telomere
replication, diagram of DNA fiber/combing assay (i.e., what is EdU?). Regarding the
current figures, Figure 1 appears to be reproduced from a previous publication,
which should be cited. All of the products of repair/recombination should be
represented for clarity. Figure 2 has typographical errors (‘mitotis’) and is not well
described by the title. Overall, this figure is somewhat confusing. For example, does
repair occur ‘Late in mitosis’? If so, what is the mechanism? Perhaps the aberrant
outcomes should be shaded in a different color to distinguish from the repair events.
What are the blue and yellow stars in the Missegregation diagram? Table 1 is
comprehensive, but lacks information about the functions of the proteins listed or
cell types in which the phenotypes were observed (primary cells? cancer cells?).
Likewise, many proteins were not mentioned in the review. Is this information
necessary/important? Perhaps a discussion of proteins that are promising anti-
cancer targets would increase the value of including this table.
3. Additional information that warrants further explanation:
a. What is the molecular nature of the “replication fork barrier” in the rDNA
repeats (p4)?
b. Additional hypotheses for why large genes are more susceptible to CNVs
have been proposed in the literature in addition to collision between transcription-
replication machinery (p5-6). These models should also be discussed.
c. The authors mention that ‘dysfunctional histone dynamics might trigger
the induction of ALT at telomeres’ (p7). What changes in histone compositions/
positioning/modifications are observed or predicted based on the experimental
evidence? How might this impact replication fork stalling at telomeres?
d. The authors mention that a detailed description of the protein factors
involved in repair will not be discussed in the current review. However, the absence
of adequate information regarding the functions and roles of key players, e.g., ATR,
HOP2-MND1, SLX4, SMC5-6, 53BP1, etc. causes their mention to be a source of
confusion to readers unfamiliar with the field. Background information based on
the primary literature would provide a context to understand the relevance of these
discussions. For example, what is known about ATR in response to replication
stress? What is 53BP1 and what are 53BP1 ‘bodies’? SLX4 serves as a ‘scaffold’ for
what purpose? etc.

Dear David,
I apologize for the delay in responding to the referees’ comments. In response to the com-
ments of Referee 2 (Referee 1 asked for no further work), we have made the following
changes:
Point 1: The review is quite abbreviated. The referee suggested the addition of more
background information on oncogene-induced replication stress, common frag-
ile sites and BIR. This we have done. The referee also suggested the inclusion
of new figures. In response to this, we have made a new Figure 1 on the BIR
process and have split Figure 2 into two separate figures that have been edited
in order to make them clearer. We have edited the text on the figures as sug-
gested too.
Point 2: There is information that warrants further explanation. We have either
added additional text for each of the points (a-d), or have added additional cita-
tions to reviews where more detailed background information can be found.
With best wishes,
