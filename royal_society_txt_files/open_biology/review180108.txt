Biochemical and in vitro evidence indicates that PINK1-linked Parkin phosphorylation at Ser65 is
an important activating mechanism, so it is an important step to validate this in vivo under
physiological conditions. McWilliams et al present a characterisation of a novel Parkin knock-in
model that targets the phospho-site Ser65. They validate that the S65A mutant lacks parkin
activity in vivo, using multiple assays, and further describe that these mice exhibit marked
locomotor deficits at 12 months and beyond but in the absence of overt neurodegeneration (at 18
months). They further extend the in vivo relevance of the Ser65 site by describing a Parkinson’s
patient with S65N mutation, who shows molecular and clinical hallmarks of Parkin deficiency.
This is an important and timely study of an in vivo model (and clinical case) that
substantiates existing in vitro data. It furthermore introduces a new mammalian model that, in
contrast to other similar models, shows disease-relevant motor phenotypes which should be of
high interest to the field. The study covers a lot of ground, which can be good but is inevitably a
little limited in depth leaving the reader wanting to know more about each aspect. Nevertheless,
the strength of the study lies in the biochemical characterisation of the physiological function of
Parkin phospho-Ser65 and the assays are well performed and accurately reported, but the
observations raise some additional questions. For instance, regarding the mouse behaviour, is
there an age when there are no behavioural differences observed with the balance beam? i.e. does
the behaviour start normal and get worse, or is it always deficient? If so, what are the
implications? Are these defects responsive to L-DOPA (even though DA neurons and metabolism
is not detectably affected)? If data are not available, comments on these questions would be
welcome in the text.
The authors cite Goldberg et al for precedence for a fine motor defect in parkin KO, though it is
generally considered that there is a lack of robust phenotypes (e.g. PMID: 15684050). The authors
should further discuss their model against the KO. Moreover, it would be interesting to know
how a S65A/KO mouse behaves (i.e. ameliorating possible confounding genetic background
effects).
It is surprising that S65N, which shows little or no parkin activity, doesn’t alter A/O induced
mitophagy. Although the authors cite Allen et al that lack of Parkin or PINK1 doesn’t affect
depolarisation-induced mitophagy in fibroblasts, it is possible that the mito-QC reporter is just
the wrong reporter to use here?
3
Minor:
- To be more accurate, the authors should mention in the introduction that the PINK1/Parkin
related clinical cases can occur in the absence OR presence of Lewy Bodies (e.g. PMID: 20356854).
- The authors indicate (p7) “extra-neural tissues (heart, spleen, kidney and pancreas)” but shown
lung, spleen, and pancreas. Also, it is perhaps just an unfortunate occurrence that the olfactory
bulb signal for WT is weak/non-existent.
- It is curious that in Fig 2, the levels of non-ubiquitylated CISD1 increase after A/O treatment.
Any idea why? Could this simply be an increase of total loading? And why did the authors
switch to CCCP for Supp Fig 2? A note on this might benefit the readers.
- One assumes that Supp Fig 2 used HOM KI/KO but it isn’t mentioned. For consistency, it
would be useful if the labels matched with Fig. 2.
- The journal may have a policy on this but in general, in my impression, statements of
significance should be left for data where a measure of significance is done. Where it is
qualitative (e.g. all the biochemical data), statements such as ‘substantive/substantial’ could be
used instead.
- p17. I was intrigued by this statement “We first generated a stable mitophagy reporter cell line
via retroviral transduction of mito-QC”, thinking ‘was it really using a retrovirus?’, but could not
locate a proper description of this technique in Methods, although I did notice p36 mentioned
“Primary mouse skin fibroblast cultures… from the patient and one matched control” which I
assume should refer to the human and not mouse. Both points need clarifying/correcting.
- Supp Fig. 6. The images are at too low magnification to appreciate the change in reporter signal.
It would be nice to see a higher mag image too. Besides this, I don’t understand the indication of
the statistical analysis. It looks like the mitolysosomes per cell/ROI is likely to be significantly
higher in S65N than WT, and the other chart is trending in the same direction.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
Here the authors have extended their studies of the PINK1/Parkin system, in which PINK1
phosphorylates Ub at S65 and the Parkin E3 ligase in its UBL at S65, and in combination these
phosphorylations stimulate Parkin E3 Ub ligase activity, promoting elimination of dysfunctional
mitochondria by mitophagy. For this purpose, they generated S65A Parkin knock-in mutant
mice, and analyzed the consequences for Parkin target ubiquitylation in the striatum/cortex and
for voluntary motor functions. S65A Parkin protein was found to be present in all tissues
examined at the same levels as WT Parkin. Unlike WT cultured cortical neurons, S65A/S65A
Parkin cortical neurons did not exhibit a pS65 Parkin signal upon antimycin/oliogomycin (A/O)
stimulation, as expected, and also had no detectable level of ubiquitylated CISD1 Parkin target
protein, consistent with a lack of Parkin E3 ligase activity. They also showed that these cells
lacked detectable pS65 Ub chains when stimulated with antimycin/oligomycin mitochondrial
ETC inhibitors. Behavioral analysis of the S65A/S65A Parkin mice demonstrated defects in
balance beam accuracy at the age of 12 months, and there was reduced respiratory control ratio,
which reflects mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, specifically in the striatum, but again
only at 12 months of age. Neuroanatomical examination did not reveal any deficit in
dopaminergic striatal neuron numbers or distribution, nor in basal mitophagy, or dopamine (DA)
or DOPAC levels in the S65AS65A Parkin mice. Finally, they identified a rare early onset PD
Finnish patient, with exceptionally slow disease progression, who they found harbors a
homozygous S65N Parkin mutation, and showed that there was a deficit in DA transport
function in the caudate and putamen. The functional repercussions of the S65N Parkin mutation
were demonstrated by solving a crystal structure of S65N Parkin, and by various cell biology and
biochemical assays. No pS65 signal was observed when HeLa cells expressing S65N Parkin were
treated with CCCP, and the levels of CCCP-induced pS65 Ub chains and ubiquitylated Miro1/2
chains were low and comparable to those seen in cells expressing S65A Parkin, in contrast to
HeLa cells expressing WT Parkin.
This in vivo genetic analysis of the function of the Parkin S65 phosphorylation site is an
important advance, and constitutes a nice follow up study of the role of S65 Parkin
phosphorylation in maintaining neuronal function and how deficits in Parkin activation might
lead to Parkinson’s disease. The neural phenotypes of the S65AS65A Parkin are rather
disappointing, but this is offset by the finding of a S65N PD patient, who exhibited very slow
disease progression, indicating that this particular mutation (and by extension the S65A
mutation) would be expected to exhibit a relatively mild phenotype in a model system. The main
conclusion that S65 Parkin phosphorylation is required to increase its E3 Ub ligase activity in the
brain is important, although one would have been anticipated this based on given the prior
biochemical studies and experiments with cultured cells. Obviously, it would be ideal to
generate a striatum-specific S65A Parkin knock-in to demonstrate that it is a lack of S65
phosphorylation in these specific neurons that is responsible for the neural phenotypes, although
this is clearly beyond the scope of the current paper.
Points: 1. Figure 1C: It is not clear why there are two CISD1 bands but only one CISD1-Ub band.
2. Figure 2A: It would be helpful to have a total anti-Ub blot for these samples for comparison.
3. Figure 5A: Without some additional labeling, it is not exactly obvious what the data mean or
how they are interpreted!
5
4. Figure S5B: The level of pS65 Ub induced by CCCP treatment was significantly higher in the
S65N/S65N patient-derived fibroblasts than in the S65A/S65A mouse fibroblasts in Figure S2A.
Do the authors have an explanation?
5. Are the S65A/S65A Parkin mice more sensitive to chronic mitotoxicity stress?
Minor points: 1. The authors call their approach to generating the S65A/S65A Parkin mice
”transgenesis”, but in fact these mice do not contain a transgene, and their mutational strategy
instead involved genetic engineering of ES cells by homologous recombination.
2. Figure 1: It might be easier to compare the WT and S65A/S65A samples if the blot were split
in two and mounted above one another.
3. Figure1/2: The authors should be consistent with using OA or A/O.
4. Figure 2: It would be better to replace HOM with S65A/S65A.
5. Figure 4B: The authors need to explain what DOPAC is and what its significance is. At what
age were these analyzed?
6. Figure 4D: The arrowheads should be defined.
7. Figure S4B: It is not entirely clear what the “days” on the abscissa refer to.

Dear Professor Glover,
Many thanks for your positive feedback on our manuscript and
providing us an opportunity to submit a revised version for
publication. We have addressed the reviewers’ comments and
these are detailed below. Excitingly, we have identified a second
unrelated patient harbouring a homozygous Parkin S65N
mutation and have included the clinical details of this case in the
revised manuscript to bolster the clinical relevance of our findings.
Given that PINK1 interacts with Parkin by phosphorylating it at its
Ser65 residue (Kondapalli et al., 2012 Open Biology), the present
study is the first to demonstrate the pathophysiological
importance of this pathway in Parkinson’s disease. We anticipate
it will be of substantial interest.
We thank you for considering our revised manuscript and the
fair review process, and are excited to see the finished
manuscript in Open Biology.

We thank both reviewers for their time and insightful comments which we

responses below.
Reviewer 1
Points:
“Is there an age when there are no behavioural differences observed with
the balance beam? i.e. does the behaviour start normal and get worse, or
is it always deficient? If so, what are the implications? Are these defects
responsive to L-DOPA (even though DA neurons and metabolism is not
detectably affected)? If data are not available, comments on these
questions would be welcome in the text.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the text to address these points.
“The authors cite Goldberg et al for precedence for a fine motor defect in

phenotypes (e.g. PMID: 15684050). The authors should further discuss
their model against the KO. Moreover, it would be interesting to know how
a S65A/KO mouse behaves (i.e. ameliorating possible confounding
genetic background effects).”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the text to address these points.
“It is surprising that S65N, which shows little or no parkin activity, doesn’t
alter A/O induced mitophagy. Although the authors cite Allen et al that
Page 3 of 7
lack of Parkin or PINK1 doesn’t affect depolarisation-induced mitophagy in
fibroblasts, it is possible that the mito-QC reporter is just the wrong
reporter to use here?”
<U+F0B7> We have published two previous studies of the mito-QC reporter
that validates its ability to measure mitophagy in vivo. Furthermore,
a complimentary study in Drosophila compared the mito-QC and
mt-Keima reporters and found that both led to similar results in flies
in vivo [Lee et al. J Cell Biol 2018 217: 1613-1622]. Of interest, the
exhaustive characterisation conducted in the cited study concluded
that mito-QC is the more robust mitophagy reporter.
Minor points:
“To be more accurate, the authors should mention in the introduction that
the PINK1/Parkin related clinical cases can occur in the absence OR
presence of Lewy Bodies (e.g. PMID: 20356854).”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the text to address this point. The original
reference we used is an appropriate citation for this point.
“The authors indicate (p7) “extra-neural tissues (heart, spleen, kidney and
pancreas)” but shown lung, spleen, and pancreas. Also, it is perhaps just
an unfortunate occurrence that the olfactory bulb signal for WT is
weak/non-existent.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the text to indicate ‘heart, spleen, lung and
pancreas’ that reflects the data of the other tissues shown. We
have also repeated the analysis of the sub-dissected brain regions
and provide a new Figure 1B that shows robust expression of
Parkin in the wild-type olfactory bulb.
“It is curious that in Fig 2, the levels of non-ubiquitylated CISD1 increase
after A/O treatment. Any idea why? Could this simply be an increase of
total loading?”
<U+F0B7> We predict the elevated levels of non-ubiquitylated CISD1 may be
due in part to the increased association/proximity of CISD1 to
ubiquitylated chains at the mitochondria, although further work
would be required to substantiate this which is beyond the scope of
Page 4 of 7
the article. In Appendix 1 of this letter, we provide a figure that
confirms equal loading for Figure 2.
“And why did the authors switch to CCCP for Supp Fig 2? A note on this
might benefit the readers.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the text to explain that primary neurons do not
tolerate CCCP whereas primary lung fibroblasts were able to
tolerate CCCP treatment.
“One assumes that Supp Fig 2 used HOM KI/KO but it isn’t mentioned.
For consistency, it would be useful if the labels matched with Fig. 2.”
<U+F0B7> Yes we did use cells derived from homozygous mice for these
experiments. We have modified the labels to match Figure 2.
“The journal may have a policy on this but in general, in my impression,
statements of significance should be left for data where a measure of
significance is done. Where it is qualitative (e.g. all the biochemical data),
statements such as ‘substantive/substantial’ could be used instead.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the text to address these points.
“p17. I was intrigued by this statement “We first generated a stable
mitophagy reporter cell line via retroviral transduction of mito-QC”,
thinking ‘was it really using a retrovirus?’, but could not locate a proper
description of this technique in Methods, although I did notice p36
mentioned “Primary mouse skin fibroblast cultures… from the patient and
one matched control” which I assume should refer to the human and not
mouse. Both points need clarifying/correcting.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the text to address these points. We have
included how the retrovirus was generated in the Methods section.
“Supp Fig. 6. The images are at too low magnification to appreciate the
change in reporter signal. It would be nice to see a higher mag image too.
Besides this, I don’t understand the indication of the statistical analysis. It
looks like the mitolysosomes per cell/ROI is likely to be significantly higher
in S65N than WT, and the other chart is trending in the same direction.”
<U+F0B7> We have revised the Figure to show a higher magnification of the
images. Since mitolyososomes per cell/ROI does not control for the
Page 5 of 7
total amount of mitochondria which can vary between cells
especially unrelated human cells, we have removed this and
instead show mitolysosome quantification controlled for the total
amount of mitochondria.
Reviewer 2
Points:
“1. Figure 1C: It is not clear why there are two CISD1 bands but only one
CISD1-Ub band.”
<U+F0B7> The upper CISD1 band is non-specific.
“2. Figure 2A: It would be helpful to have a total anti-Ub blot for these
samples for comparison.”
<U+F0B7> We have addressed this above and have provided a figure in the
Appendix 1 of this letter that shows equal loading for Figure 2
(Memcode Panel).
“3. Figure 5A: Without some additional labeling, it is not exactly obvious
what the data mean or how they are interpreted!”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the text and the figure legend of the paper to
address this.
“4. Figure S5B: The level of pS65 Ub induced by CCCP treatment was
significantly higher in the S65N/S65N patient-derived fibroblasts than in
the S65A/S65A mouse fibroblasts in Figure S2A. Do the authors have an
explanation?”
<U+F0B7> The human primary skin fibroblasts and the mouse lung fibroblasts
are not comparable.
“5. Are the S65A/S65A Parkin mice more sensitive to chronic mitotoxicity
stress?”
Page 6 of 7
<U+F0B7> The reviewer raises an interesting point however we have not
addressed this and to do so would be beyond the scope of the
current manuscript.
Minor points:
“1. The authors call their approach to generating the S65A/S65A Parkin
mice ”transgenesis”, but in fact these mice do not contain a transgene,
and their mutational strategy instead involved genetic engineering of ES
cells by homologous recombination.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the paper to address these points.
“2. Figure 1: It might be easier to compare the WT and S65A/S65A
samples if the blot were split in two and mounted above one another.”
<U+F0B7> We have revised the Figure1B. However, we do not think that
splitting the blot in two would be appropriate as for the reader the
current formats indicates that the WT and S65A/S65A samples
were all analysed on the same western blot.
“3. Figure1/2: The authors should be consistent with using OA or A/O.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the paper to address these points.
“4. Figure 2: It would be better to replace HOM with S65A/S65A.”
<U+F0B7> We have maintained the HOM designation in light of comments
from Reviewer 1.
“5. Figure 4B: The authors need to explain what DOPAC is and what its
significance is. At what age were these analyzed?”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the paper to address that 3,4-
dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) is a metabolite of dopamine.
“6. Figure 4D: The arrowheads should be defined.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the paper to address these points.
Page 7 of 7
“7. Figure S4B: It is not entirely clear what the “days” on the abscissa
refer to.”
<U+F0B7> We have modified the paper to address these points.
