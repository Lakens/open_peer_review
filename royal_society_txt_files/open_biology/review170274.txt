Snail is a critical regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by regulating
expression as a transcription factor. In the present study, Xin-Hua Feng and colleagues descripted
an essential role for nuclear phosphatase SCP4/CTDSPL2, which acts as a novel Snail
phosphatase. Importantly, SCP4 dephosphorylates and stabilizes Snail, thereby enhancing
TGFß-induced EMT. The authors demonstrated that SCP4 physically interacts with and directly
dephosphorylates Snail at Ser-96 and Ser-100, and then stabilizes Snail depending on its catalytic
activity. The manuscript was well organized and the results are convincing. Their findings are
novel and provide an additional mechanism in EMT and metastasis, but the following minor
points should be addressed before publication.
1. In Figure 1E-G, qRT-PCR experiments showed that SCP4 enabled a more profound decrease in
E-cadherin mRNA in the presence of TGFß, and dramatically increased the mRNA levels of
Fibronectin. The statistic significance between samples should be provided.
2. In Figure 4B, SCP4 or SCP4DN was purified by immunoprecipitations from HEK293T cells and
then was applied for in in vitro dephosphorylation assays. This results are not convincing
enough, as such immunoprecipitations colud also some unkown SCP4 binding proteins that may
function in dephosphorylating Snail1. Thus, examination the effects of purified GST-SCP4 protein
from E.coli will be better.
3. In Figure 3C, why the expression level of Snail protein whole cell lysates was not obviously
increased by MG132 treatment or co-expressed SCP4?
4. Similar with SCP4, it have been reported that SCP1, 2 and 3 interact with and dephosphorylate
Snail at the GSK3ß phosphorylation motif and regulate its stability. It seems that these SCP
proteins may function redundantly. However, when endogenous SCP4 was knocked down, the
protein levels of Snail was markedly decreased (Fig. 2A), suggesting that SCP4 may be the major
phosphatase of Snail. Does depletion of SCP4 eliminate the endogenous phosphorylation level of
Snail induced by GSK3beta?

4
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:

Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402

nt-to-point reply to the reviewers’ comments:
would like to sincerely thank both reviewers for their very helpful suggestions and positive
ments. Point-by-point responses are provided below.
eree #1
In Figure 1E-G, qRT-PCR experiments showed that SCP4 enabled a more profound
rease in E-cadherin mRNA in the presence of TGFß, and dramatically increased the mRNA
ls of Fibronectin. The statistic significance between samples should be provided.
ponse: Statistic significance stars were added to the Figure 1E-G and Figure 2D
In Figure 4B, SCP4 or SCP4DN was purified by immunoprecipitations from HEK293T cells
then was applied for in in vitro dephosphorylation assays. This results are not convincing
ugh, as such immunoprecipitations could also some unknown SCP4 binding proteins that
y function in dephosphorylating Snail1. Thus, examination the effects of purified GST-SCP4
ein from E.coli will be better.
ponse: In our in vitro dephosphorylation assay, cell lysates were harvested in RIPA lysis
er (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1% Triton X-100, 1% Sodium deoxycholate,
% Sodium dodecyl sulfate), which can dissociate most protein-protein interactions. The lysis
er used in this assay was added into the figure legend.
In Figure 3C, why the expression level of Snail protein whole cell lysates was not obviously
eased by MG132 treatment or co-expressed SCP4?
ponse: MG132 and SCP4 did dramatically increase snail expression. In Fig 3C, we adjusted
snail expression to the same level to examine the level of poly-ubiquitin.
Similar with SCP4, it have been reported that SCP1, 2 and 3 interact with and
hosphorylate Snail at the GSK3ß phosphorylation motif and regulate its stability. It seems
these SCP proteins may function redundantly. However, when endogenous SCP4 was
cked down, the protein levels of Snail was markedly decreased (Fig. 2A), suggesting that
P4 may be the major phosphatase of Snail. Does depletion of SCP4 eliminate the
ogenous phosphorylation level of Snail induced by GSK3beta?
ponse: SCP4 did show a stronger effect than its relatives SCP1/2/3 in Snail
hosphorylation (Figure 3A). The endogenous phosphorylation level of Snail could not be
mined due to the unavailability of anti-phospho-Snail antibody at Ser-96 and Ser-100. We
d to immunoprecipitated endogenous Snail and then test phosphorylation level using anti-
spho-<U+F062>-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) antibody, but unfortunately, Snail antibody was not good
ugh for IP.
