In this study, Dzhindzhev et al. elaborate on the functional interplay between Ana2 and PLK4,
two essential components in the early stages of centriole assembly. The cornerstone of this study
is the identification of a novel PLK4 phosphorylation site in Ana2 N-termini that is required for
the targeting og Ana2 to centrioles, whereas the conserved STAN motif phosphorylation
promotes the subsequent interaction between Ana2 and Sas6. The proposed two-step PLK4
phosphorylation model is timely and important in our understanding of the molecular basis of
centriole biogenesis, and the overall data presented here are well validated and well described.
There are still, however, few points for the authors to consider:
1. Holland and colleagues report that STAN motif phosphorylation by PLK4 underpins the
binding dynamics of STIL with the centriole. Did the authors consider testing whether N-
terminal phosphorylation of STIL may also affect the turnover of centriolar Ana2?
2. In the experiments in Figure2 and 4, it would be important to provide evidence supporting
siRNA knockdown efficiency of Ana2, Asl, PLK4, Sas4, Sas6 and Slimb, using either IF staining or
western blot.
3. In Figure2, 4B and 6B, the authors claim that Ana2 is not loaded to centrioles under the
indicated conditions. The term "not loaded" should be backed up by the appropriate statistics. A
similar comment can be made for Figure 6A.
4. The authors state that PLK4 phosphorylation of Ana2 at S38 is critical for recruiting Ana2 and
regulating centriole duplication. However, it is necessary here to first examine whether S38A
mutant affects Ana2 protein stability. Intriguingly, is this phosphorylation also required for
overexpression of Ana2 induced centriole over-duplication?
5. The authors may want to clarify if they know/think that phosphorylation of Ana2 at S38 is
functionally conserved in other organisms. The conservation in this region suggests it may well
be and although it do think it remains beyond the scope of this manuscript to show that
phosphorylation at this residue is indeed functionally conserved in other organisms, the author
may wish to clarify where they stand on this issue. Have they tested this?
Minor points
1. The authors need to provide the information for the scale bar of the imaging data and legends
in Figure 1, 4 and 6.
2. In the proposed model in Figure 7, it may be better to label the N- or C- terminal part of Ana2
to help understanding the two-step phosphorylation by PLK4.

label_comment_2
PlK4 is a central component of the cascade of events that leads to centriole duplication in
eukaryotic cells. This essential Serine/threonine-protein kinase phosphorylates Ana2 in several
sites localized within the STAN domain at its C-terminus. Phosphorilation of STAN is required to
recruit Sas6 (but not Ana2) to the site of the protocentriol and initiate the formation of the
protocentriol. However, the fine molecular mechanisms and the hierarchical order of events
underlying this fundamental process in eukaryotic cells remain unclear. In the present study,
Dzhindzhev and collegues using structured illumination microscopy, biochemistry and RNAi
approach identify 1) the order in which components of the Plk4 phosphorilation pathways are
recruited to specific regions of the the cenriol/centrosome and, more importantly, 2) a functional
phosforilation site outside the STAN domain required for Ana2-mediated recruitment of Sas6 at
the centriol and essential for centriol duplication.
All imaging and biochemistry shown are of the highest quality and the paper well written in a
logic progression. The high level of the technical approach is instrumental to a mechanistic
understanding of centriol duplication. The conclusions are supported by the results described in
the main and supplemental figures. Overall, the study is well conducted and the findings
provocative. Thus, this reviewer recommends publication of this study in Open Biology.
Nonetheless, there are a few minor points of concern that should be addressed, specifically:
1- In figures involving microscopy the authors present images of centrioles/centrosomes of cells
at different phases of the cell cycles. Although a pericentrin counterstaining is always shown it
would be helpful to add a supplemental figure combining the pericentrin staining with a DNA
staining showing recognizable stages of different phases of the cell cycle. This would clarify how
the authors identified different steps of the cell cycles. Alternatively, it should be clearly defined
in the text haw different cell cycle phases were identified.
2- The functional mining of the S38 phosphorylation is a central finding of this study. However,
as the authors have pointed out, this phosphorylation site was not identified by the unbiased
mass spectrometry analysis of Ana2 from in vivo or in vitro extracts, questioning that this
4
phosphorylation event occurs due to the Plk4 activity. However, the authors argue that the Ana2
region containing S38 belongs to a poorly ionized peptide which interferes with mass spec
analysis. Importantly, they show a Phospho-Mascot-interpreted fragmentation spectra of the
peptide which reveals presence of phosphorylation of the S38 in an analysis conducted by an in
vitro experiment. This result is basically the only direct evidence that Plk4 directly
phosphorylates S38. Thus, it should be further emphasized in the text and in the discussion and
the spectra shown in a main figure (a panel of Fig. 5 for example) rather than displayed as a
supplementary figure.
3- To uncouple the function of the Plk4 kinase activity on the C-terminus of Ana2 from the S38
phosphorilation it would be interesting to attempt a rescue of the effect of the Ana2-UTR-RNAi
shown in fig 6 with the truncated Ana2-1-140aa sequence. A rescue would more clearly
demonstrate that other phosphorylated sights at the C-terminus are not required in the Ana2
recruitment process to the site of the protocentriol.
4- In Fig 1 and 4 the unit bars are missing.
5- In Fig. 3, for the sake of clarity the mother centriole should be labeled.

Intriguingly, mutating the STAN motif of Ana2 so that it cannot get phosphorylated by Plk4 does
not prevent it from loading into the procentriole. To understand this process the authors first
5
addressed the course of Ana2 recruitment to the procentriole with respect to Sas6. They found
that Ana2 loading occurs before that of Sas6. RNAi depletion experiments showed that loading of
Ana2 critically requires kinase-active Plk4 as well as its loading factor Asl. However,
interestingly, at the time of Ana2 loading, Plk4 is located in a number of beads of which only one
coincides with the single dot of Ana2 and therefore Plk4 localisation alone does not dictate the
place of Ana2 loading. The authors then went on to identify the critical phosphorylation site,
which obviously could not be any of the Plk4 phosphorylation sites in he STAN motif and found
what they call the Ana2-Stil motif within which lies the critical S38 site that they show to be
essential for Ana2 loading and indeed for centriole duplication.
Altogether, this is an excellent manuscript that takes advantage of cutting edge technology
including notably excellent structured illumination microscopy to answer what was until now
one of the still standing burning questions regarding the molecular pathway of centriole
assembly.
I recommend publication.

All comments were addressed adequately and satisfactorily.
Appendix A
Reviewer #1:
PlK4 is a central component of the cascade of events that leads to centriole duplication in eukaryotic
cells. This essential Serine/threonine-protein kinase phosphorylates Ana2 in several sites localized
within the STAN domain at its C-terminus. Phosphorilation of STAN is required to recruit Sas6 (but
not Ana2) to the site of the protocentriol and initiate the formation of the protocentriol. However,
the fine molecular mechanisms and the hierarchical order of events underlying this fundamental
process in eukaryotic cells remain unclear. In the present study, Dzhindzhev and collegues using
structured illumination microscopy, biochemistry and RNAi approach identify 1) the order in which
components of the Plk4 phosphorilation pathways are recruited to specific regions of the the
cenriol/centrosome and, more importantly, 2) a functional phosforilation site outside the STAN
domain required for Ana2-mediated recruitment of Sas6 at the centriol and essential for centriole
duplication.
All imaging and biochemistry shown are of the highest quality and the paper well written in a logic
progression. The high level of the technical approach is instrumental to a mechanistic understanding
of centriol duplication. The conclusions are supported by the results described in the main and
supplemental figures. Overall, the study is well conducted and the findings provocative. Thus, this
reviewer recommends publication of this study in Open Biology. Nonetheless, there are a few minor
points of concern that should be addressed, specifically:
We thank the referee for these helpful and supportive comments and have made the modifications
indicated below:
1- In figures involving microscopy the authors present images of centrioles/centrosomes of cells at
different phases of the cell cycles. Although a pericentrin counterstaining is always shown it would
be helpful to add a supplemental figure combining the pericentrin staining with a DNA staining
showing recognizable stages of different phases of the cell cycle. This would clarify how the authors
identified different steps of the cell cycles. Alternatively, it should be clearly defined in the text haw
different cell cycle phases were identified.
We have added a description of how stages of the cell cycle were defined to the Materials and
Methods. Importantly, we assigned stages of telophase, in which chromosomes have
decondensed, by relating the positions of the centrosomes to the long axis of the dividing cell
immobilised on Concanavalin A. We observe that in early telophase, centrosomes are positioned
on the distal side of the nucleus to the spindle microtubules. As telophase progresses, the
centrosomes appear to begin to migrate (mid-telophase) relative to the spindle such that they
move towards the spindle proximal side of the nucleus at the time of the first indication of
cytokinetic furrow formation (late telophase). Due to the adhesion of cells onto the
ConconavalinA-coated coverslips, the abscission stage of cytokinesis cannot be completed. Thus
cells having a long cytokinetic bridge can also be in G1 phase. We classified such cells as in
cytokinesis/G1.
2- The functional mining of the S38 phosphorylation is a central finding of this study. However, as
the authors have pointed out, this phosphorylation site was not identified by the unbiased mass
spectrometry analysis of Ana2 from in vivo or in vitro extracts, questioning that this phosphorylation
event occurs due to the Plk4 activity. However, the authors argue that the Ana2 region containing
S38 belongs to a poorly ionized peptide which interferes with mass spec analysis. Importantly, they
show a Phospho-Mascot-interpreted fragmentation spectra of the peptide which reveals presence of
phosphorylation of the S38 in an analysis conducted by an in vitro experiment. This result is basically
the only direct evidence that Plk4 directly phosphorylates S38. Thus, it should be further emphasized
in the text and in the discussion and the spectra shown in a main figure (a panel of Fig. 5 for
example) rather than displayed as a supplementary figure.
We agree with the referee that this is an important mass spectrum to present. However, we
believe that the data is equally accessible in the supplementary material for those who are
interested in the details.
3- To uncouple the function of the Plk4 kinase activity on the C-terminus of Ana2 from the S38
phosphorilation it would be interesting to attempt a rescue of the effect of the Ana2-UTR-RNAi
shown in fig 6 with the truncated Ana2-1-140aa sequence. A rescue would more clearly demonstrate
that other phosphorylated sights at the C-terminus are not required in the Ana2 recruitment process
to the site of the protocentriol.
We believe we have shown this uncoupling already. The main (if not the only) Plk4-
phosphorylation sites we have previously identified in Ana2’s C-terminus are the 4 conserved
serines in the STAN motif (Dzhindzhev et al., 2014 cited). We demonstrated that when these 4
serines are mutated to alanines, Ana2 is still able to load onto centrioles, albeit no longer able to
recruit Sas6. Importantly, we are not claiming that S38-phosphorylation is the only site essential
for and thereby sufficient by itself to mediate Ana2-loading. Only that it is critical for this process.
We do not believe that the referee’s suggested experiment would be possible. This is because the
coiled regions of Ana2 are also required for its localisation to centrioles and these would be
excluded from the suggested construct.
4- In Fig 1 and 4 the unit bars are missing.
This is corrected
5- In Fig. 3, for the sake of clarity the mother centriole should be labeled.
This is now indicated both on the figure and in the figure legend.

Reviewer #3:
In this study, Dzhindzhev et al. elaborate on the functional interplay between Ana2 and PLK4, two
essential components in the early stages of centriole assembly. The cornerstone of this study is the
identification of a novel PLK4 phosphorylation site in Ana2 N-termini that is required for the
targeting og Ana2 to centrioles, whereas the conserved STAN motif phosphorylation promotes the
subsequent interaction between Ana2 and Sas6. The proposed two-step PLK4 phosphorylation
model is timely and important in our understanding of the molecular basis of centriole biogenesis,
and the overall data presented here are well validated and well described. There are still, however,
few points for the authors to consider:
We thank the reviewer for these supportive comments and respond to the detailed points below:
1. Holland and colleagues report that STAN motif phosphorylation by PLK4 underpins the binding
dynamics of STIL with the centriole. Did the authors consider testing whether N-terminal
phosphorylation of STIL may also affect the turnover of centriolar Ana2?
Our previous work (Dzhindzhev et al. 2014) showed that in Drosophila the STAN-motif
phosphorylations are not required for Ana2-loading. Indeed a 4-alanine substitutions mutant
version of Ana2 was able to load onto centrioles, albeit not able to recruit Sas6. This discrepancy
may reflect a difference between the systems or may reflect the lack of consensus in the field on
the issue (Ohta et al. 2014 did not observe a requirement for the STAN-motif phosphorylations for
the loading of STIL).
We agree that the absence/presence of Ana2 at centrioles may reflect either a failure/success of a
single loading event or, indeed difference of turnover. Currently, however we have no technical
means available to us for investigating the live dynamics of Ana2 at centrioles (FRAP, using super-
resolution microscopy). Therefore, we use the term “loaded” to reflect the effective absence or
presence of Ana2. We add a statement to the legend of Figure 2 to clarify this.
2. In the experiments in Figure2 and 4, it would be important to provide evidence supporting siRNA
knockdown efficiency of Ana2, Asl, PLK4, Sas4, Sas6 and Slimb, using either IF staining or western
blot.
We carried out experiments under routine conditions previously established in our lab for the
knockdown of these proteins (Dzhindzhev et al., 2010; 2014; Fu et al., 2016) and carried out RNAi
for 5 days (3 days in the case of Plk4 RNAi). The efficiency of the depletion was evident from the
fact that 30-60% of cells had no centrosomes. Our analysis was then carried out upon cells in which
a single centrosome persists showing the defects we document. We describe this in the revised
Materials and Methods.
3. In Figure2, 4B and 6B, the authors claim that Ana2 is not loaded to centrioles under the indicated
conditions. The term "not loaded" should be backed up by the appropriate statistics. A similar
comment can be made for Figure 6A.
The acquisition of images of centrioles in the correct orientation for structured illumination
microscopy is a time-consuming procedure. Our approach was, therefore, to collect a target
number of images of centrioles in a suitable orientation for imaging at the critical stage of mitosis
or in interphase as appropriate (30 images for most experiments) and then present ALL of the
data. By the terms “loaded” or “not-loaded”, we refer to individual centrioles that either have the
protein of interest on the D-Plp ring or not (see above comment).
4. The authors state that PLK4 phosphorylation of Ana2 at S38 is critical for recruiting Ana2 and
regulating centriole duplication. However, it is necessary here to first examine whether S38A mutant
affects Ana2 protein stability. Intriguingly, is this phosphorylation also required for overexpression of
Ana2 induced centriole over-duplication?
We have no reason to believe that prevention of phosphorylation at S38 affects Ana2 stability. The
data presented in Figure 6 indicate that the S38A protein must persist because it leads to a
dominant negative effect on the centriole. Nevertheless, we also present a Western blot (Suppl.
Fig. S4) showing that Ana2-WT-Myc and Ana2-S38A-Myc are expressed to comparable levels in the
two stable cell lines.
Unlike mammalian cells, we do not observe significant centriole over-duplication in cultured
Drosophila cells following over-expression of Ana2 alone.
5. The authors may want to clarify if they know/think that phosphorylation of Ana2 at S38 is
functionally conserved in other organisms. The conservation in this region suggests it may well be
and although it do think it remains beyond the scope of this manuscript to show that
phosphorylation at this residue is indeed functionally conserved in other organisms, the author may
wish to clarify where they stand on this issue. Have they tested this?
We have not tested this and now clarify this in the revised discussion.
Minor points
1. The authors need to provide the information for the scale bar of the imaging data and legends in
Figure 1, 4 and 6.
This is corrected
2. In the proposed model in Figure 7, it may be better to label the N- or C- terminal part of Ana2 to
help understanding the two-step phosphorylation by PLK4.
This is a good suggestion and the figure has been modified.
