Although the article is well written, it represents only a review on this topic that has been already
extensively reported in the literature. The question raised by the authors in the title of their
manuscript is still under investigation and the authors also do not answer to the question.
Moreover, authors support to halt the use of textured breast implants without a scientific
explanation disregarding to prove that smooth implants are not involved in the pathogenesis of
the lymphoma. The scope of scientific literature is to promote 1st level of evidence papers
(multicenter randimized controlled trials) in this critical and worldwide discussed topic before
coming to definitive conclusions and actions.

The authors are quoting a risk for ALCL between 1:1,000 and 1:10,000 which is relatively high. no
- one understands the true risk as denominator is unknown but in the UK the MHRA in 2019
guestimates 1:24,000
Diagnosis and therapy: could the authors comment on role of imaging staging and role of MRI,
PET-CT in diagnosed cases with BIA-ALCL.

repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,

Re: RSOB-19-0006, "Is Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell
Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) a Hazard of Breast Implant Surgery?"
Dear Open Biology Team
We thank the reviewers for their comments and have replied to these as
detailed below:
Referee: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Although the article is well written, it represents only a review on this topic
that has been already extensively reported in the literature. The question
raised by the authors in the title of their manuscript is still under
investigation and the authors also do not answer to the question. Moreover,
authors support to halt the use of textured breast implants without a
scientific explanation disregarding to prove that smooth implants are not
involved in the pathogenesis of the lymphoma. The scope of scientific
literature is to promote 1st level of evidence papers (multicenter randomized
controlled trials) in this critical and worldwide discussed topic before coming
to definitive conclusions and actions.
We are grateful to this reviewer for their comments and whilst we appreciate
there are a number of reviews on this topic, ours is succinct, easy to read and
will help to disseminate information on BIA-ALCL to a broader audience.
Indeed, the title of the paper is a question that needs to be answered and
that is why we have posed it. We present current evidence in an easy to
absorb manner to allow the reader to come to their own conclusions. We do
not suggest that all use of textured implants should be stopped, we merely
suggest that this might be necessary as further evidence arises – “It might
also be necessary to halt the use of textured implants until more is
understood about the pathogenesis of this disease”.
Referee: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors are quoting a risk for ALCL between 1:1,000 and 1:10,000 which
is relatively high. no-one understands the true risk as denominator is
unknown but in the UK the MHRA in 2019 guestimates 1:24,000
Page 1 / 2
We have clarified the incidences based on the country in which they were
reported and whether the rate cited is based on women with textured or all
implants:
Current expert opinion puts the risk of ALCL at between 1:2,832 for women
with polyurethane implants in Australia and New Zealand to 1:30,000 women
with any textured implant in the USA, with the current UK risk estimated to
be 1:24,000, a figure based on all breast implants sold.
Diagnosis and therapy: could the authors comment on role of imaging
staging and role of MRI, PET-CT in diagnosed cases with BIA-ALCL.
We have added the following to the text:
Late onset seromas (> 1 year) should be investigated by ultrasound of the
breasts, chest wall and regional lymph nodes. When ultrasound is
inconclusive, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans
may assist with the diagnosis of soft tissue masses (8). Ultrasound-guided
aspiration of seroma fluid with subsequent cytology, flow cytometry and
analysis of the cells, primarily for CD30 expression and negativity for ALK
helps to establish the diagnosis.
