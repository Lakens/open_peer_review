This is a well-written review about a timely topic. It nicely covers the current knowledge about
ELKS active zone proteins. Furthermore, the review provides novel insights and ideas on the
function of active zone proteins in general. I have only a few suggestions:
Page 2: I would suggest to already mention explicitly in the abstract that this is a review (this is
done on page 6).
Page 2: “functional roles for ELKS support that ELKS provides” consider re-wording
Page 3: I would suggest to somewhere explain what “scaffolding” exactly refers to.
Page 7: Ref. 72 is mentioned in the context of BRP but in ref. 72 Bassoon is analyzed.
Page 11: “Hence, significant roles of BRP may go beyond mediating exocytosis,…”. I am not sure
if this has been shown. The deficient survival and locomotion might also be consistent with
impaired vesicle recruitment at active zones.
Page 13: “Single channel conductance” is mentioned but the subsequent discussion focusses on
voltage dependence and kinetics of channel gating.

Manuscript ID: RSOB-17-0258
This is very timely and well-balanced review article. It is understandably written, mostly well-
structured and easy-to follow. Despite of the fact that it focuses on role of a specific protein,
which might be of interest for limited number of readers, it reveals common important molecular
principle that recently merged: the remarkable redundancy in scaffolding of presynaptic release
sites, which makes it of more broad interest.
I have only few minor issues:
Page7: ELKS protein structure and interactions: This paragraph regards only mammalian ELKS.
The C.elegans and Drosophila orthologues are discussed at other places of text, but not here. This
might be corrected to bring more coherence and structure. Also a graphical comparison of
structure of vertebrate and other ELKS might be beneficial.
Page10, para 2: Synaptic ribbons are specialization of not only retinal bipolar cells and hair cells
of cochlea as authors state, but also retinal photoreceptor cells and pinealocytes. This is a detail;
but as formulated now the sentence sounds as counting out and not as giving few examples.
Page 13-14, para Munc13 interactions….: This part might need some streamlining. The specific
interaction of bMun13-2 with ELKAS1 and its implication for synapse specific regulation of RRP
is explained in first paragraph. In the second paragraph additional structural motifs necessary for
priming activity of ELKS are described / suggested, but then authors return to bMunc13-2 and
state again that this might be important for synapse specific regulations. For my taste, there is too
much redundancy and repetition. The last sentence: “In the later scenario,…” it is not clear to me
to what does this expression refer.
Page 15: I like that authors also discuss function of ELKS in the regulation of trafficking/fusion of
Rab6 vesicles in non-neuronal cells. I was wondering, whether they also consider the role of
ELKS in membrane trafficking events beyond the vesicle exocytosis such as vesicle recycling or
budding form enodocytotic intermediates or similar. Are there hints form phenotypic
characterizations pointing to such phenotypes (e.g. changes in short-term plasticity in KOs).
References: I noticed that publication given under reference #72 most likely does not really reflect
the statement that links to it (page7, 2nd para)

sponse to reviewers’ comments for the manuscript RSOB-17-0258 entitled "ELKS
ive zone proteins as multitasking scaffolds for secretion".
are enthusiastic about the positive assessment of our review and thank the reviewers for
ir input. Below is a point-by-point response to each reviewer. We cite the reviewers’
ments in black italic typeface and provide answers in blue typeface. We feel that the
nges we made in responses to the reviewers’ comments further improve the review and we
grateful for their careful assessment.
eree 1
s is a well-written review about a timely topic. It nicely covers the current knowledge about
KS active zone proteins. Furthermore, the review provides novel insights and ideas on the
ction of active zone proteins in general.
thank the reviewer for taking time to carefully assess our manuscript and for supporting its
lication.
ve only a few suggestions:
ge 2: I would suggest to already mention explicitly in the abstract that this is a review (this is
e on page 6).
now explicitly reference that this article is a review in the abstract (line 21).
ge 2: “functional roles for ELKS support that ELKS provides” consider re-wording
s sentence has been re-worked to improve clarity. It now reads “In this review, we first
luate the need for presynaptic scaffolding, and we then discuss how the diverse synaptic
non-synaptic functional roles of ELKS support the hypothesis that ELKS provides molecular
ffolding for organizing vesicle traffic at the presynaptic active zone and in other cellular
partments.” (lines 21-24)
ge 3: I would suggest to somewhere explain what “scaffolding” exactly refers to.
now clarify on lines 48-50 that we define scaffolding as “the capture, anchoring, and spatial
anization of molecular components” which allows these components to execute their
ctional role.
ge 7: Ref. 72 is mentioned in the context of BRP but in ref. 72 Bassoon is analyzed.
are very grateful that the reviewer caught this error and have corrected it. Hallerman et al.,
ssoon speeds vesicle reloading at a central synapse.” Neuron 2010 was unintentionally cited
eu of Hallermann et al., “Mechanisms of short-term plasticity at neuromuscular active zones
rosophila,” HFSP J. 2010. This paper includes a modeling analysis of the brp mutant which
gests a deficit in both release probability and in replenishment of a reserve pool of vesicles.
ge 11: “Hence, significant roles of BRP may go beyond mediating exocytosis,…”. I am not
e if this has been shown. The deficient survival and locomotion might also be consistent with
aired vesicle recruitment at active zones.
agree with the reviewer that the synaptic deficits in the Brpnude larvae, including changes in
red-pulse ratios and loss of vesicle recruitment to the T-bar, could still account for the
ality phenotype. Our intent was to point out (Hallermann et al., J. Neurosci. 2011)
connects lethality from of the single evoked amplitudes. This, coupled with the fact that
KS1 knockout mice have a survival deficit that precedes synapse formation (Liu et al. J.
urosci. 2014), suggests that BRP may have a role in in survival that is independent of
ase. But of course, these experiments do not establish this point. We have expanded the
lanations on lines 248-253 and we leave open multiple interpretations of the data.
ge 13: “Single channel conductance” is mentioned but the subsequent discussion focusses
voltage dependence and kinetics of channel gating.
have changed the wording on lines 286-287 to make it clear that ELKS is likely changing the
etic or voltage-dependent properties of voltage-gated calcium channels as opposed to
ring total channel number or conductance values.
thank the reviewer for the careful assessment of our manuscript.
eree 2
s is very timely and well-balanced review article. It is understandably written, mostly well-
ctured and easy-to follow. Despite of the fact that it focuses on role of a specific protein,
ch might be of interest for limited number of readers, it reveals common important molecular
ciple that recently merged: the remarkable redundancy in scaffolding of presynaptic release
s, which makes it of more broad interest.
appreciate the reviewer’s positive assessment of our manuscript and agree that the topics
rotein scaffolding and molecular redundancy are broadly important to many fields.
ve only few minor issues:
ge7: ELKS protein structure and interactions: This paragraph regards only mammalian ELKS.
C.elegans and Drosophila orthologues are discussed at other places of text, but not here.
s might be corrected to bring more coherence and structure. Also a graphical comparison of
cture of vertebrate and other ELKS might be beneficial.
thank the reviewer for pointing out this clear weakness in the previous version. We have
orporated a more detailed discussion of the similarities between mouse, C.elegans, and
sophila ELKS/BRP (lines 137-145) and have included a new figure that compares these
teins (Figure 2D). This illustrates the predicted coiled-coils of each protein and highlights four
ions that are conserved at greater than 25% sequence identity across all three species. We
k that this is a significant improvement of the review and thank the reviewer for this
ment.
ge10, para 2: Synaptic ribbons are specialization of not only retinal bipolar cells and hair cells
ochlea as authors state, but also retinal photoreceptor cells and pinealocytes. This is a
ail; but as formulated now the sentence sounds as counting out and not as giving few
mples.
thank the reviewer pointing out this inconsistency and have modified the sentence to state
t synaptic ribbons are “an electron dense assembly at release sites of specialized cell types,
uding retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells, and hair cells in the inner ear” (lines 202-204).
ge 13-14, para Munc13 interactions….: This part might need some streamlining. The specific
raction of bMun13-2 with ELKAS1 and its implication for synapse specific regulation of RRP
xplained in first paragraph. In the second paragraph additional structural motifs necessary
priming activity of ELKS are described / suggested, but then authors return to bMunc13-2
state again that this might be important for synapse specific regulations. For my taste, there
oo much redundancy and repetition. The last sentence: “In the later scenario,…” it is not
ar to me to what does this expression refer.
thank the reviewer for these suggestions, and we apologize that we were not as clear on
rather complex point. We have modified the section (lines 303-327) to first address the
raction between bMunc13-2 and ELKS1 in paragraph one. In the second paragraph we now
us on the data that suggests other priming activities are present in ELKS beyond that of
unc13-2. We think that this improves clarity.
ge 15: I like that authors also discuss function of ELKS in the regulation of trafficking/fusion of
b6 vesicles in non-neuronal cells. I was wondering, whether they also consider the role of
KS in membrane trafficking events beyond the vesicle exocytosis such as vesicle recycling or
ding form enodocytotic intermediates or similar. Are there hints form phenotypic
racterizations pointing to such phenotypes (e.g. changes in short-term plasticity in KOs).
agree with the reviewer that it is possible that ELKS-Rab6 interactions play a role in local
mbrane trafficking at the synapse beyond exocytosis. We now explicitly mention this
sibility (lines 349-351). We believe that a number of mechanisms are possible, and there is
tively little evidence to either favor or reject any specific molecular mechanism. Hence, we
not want to omit or over-emphasize any one point. We thank the reviewer for commenting on
particular aspect.
erences: I noticed that publication given under reference #72 most likely does not really
ect the statement that links to it (page7, 2nd para)
are grateful to the reviewer for catching this mistake and have corrected the reference (see
ponse to reviewer #1 above).
thank the reviewer for the careful assessment of our manuscript.
