Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
This paper presents a thorough analysis of the sequences of genes of photoreceptor proteins
responsible for extinction of transduction: the G-protein receptor kinases, arrestins, and GAPs
that turn off photo-activated rhodopsin and phosphodiesterase. This analysis is then used to
provide insight into the evolution of phototransduction among vertebrates. The analysis seems to
be competently executed, and the conclusions of the paper will be of interest to investigators
working on the evolution of signal transduction as well as biochemists and physiologists doing
research on photoreceptor function.
The manuscript is however unnecessarily difficult to read and assimilate, principally because the
authors have chosen to present Introduction, Results, and Discussion all together. The
Introduction in the submitted manuscript is very short and does not sufficiently introduce the
study or explain its rationale. Results and discussion are so melded together that it is often
difficult to tell when one ends and the other begins. As a result, readers will have difficulty
judging what part of the work consists of actual findings, and what part interpretation based on
those findings. This organization contrasts with the one the authors used in their recently
published article “Evolution of the vertebrate phototransduction cascade activation steps” in
Developmental Biology, which follows a more traditional format of Introduction, Methods,
Results, and Discussion.
I take first section on the GRKs as an example. The first two paragraphs of the section beginning
on p. 3 with “G-protein receptor kinase, GRK” should have been placed in the Introduction.
Readers will expect the Results section to begin with results. Then at the bottom of p. 4, without
any preamble, the text begins a section of discussion. This section about the bird GRKs is out of
place and peripheral to the flow of the Results section. It clearly belongs later in the paper in a
discussion of possible difficulties in the analysis, along (for example) with the grouping of
lamprey and hagfish arrestin sequences with Arr-C. Figure 3 with its accompanying discussion is
also problematic. How essential is this description of GRK sequences to the main discussion of
the paper? Could it not be put in the supplementary material? As it stands, this discussion
interrupts the flow of the paper and seems more appropriate to a review article than to a research
paper. Much the same could be said of Fig. 8 and its attendant text. In addition, I suggest that
Tables 2 and 3 be omitted and their principal conclusions be summarized in the text.
In sum, the authors would greatly improve the presentation of their material if they would adopt
a more traditional format clearly separating their findings from their interpretation, and if they
would endeavor to provide a clearer focus and remove material that is not directly related to
their principal concern.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
The study by Lamb et al. is a continuation of the authors’ research aimed at systematic
description of the evolution of phototransduction components in vertebrate rods and cones. This
part of the project focuses on the proteins responsible for the shut-off of the visual cascade.
Similarly to recent reports on the activation steps, this report benefits from new extensive
transcriptome data on hagfish and lamprey. Lamb and colleagues utilize modern and robust
software for the phylogenetic analysis allowing for introducing constraints when unconstrained
phylogenies are implausible or do not conform to known gene synteny. Careful consideration of
the functional motifs in GRKs, arrestins and RGS9 combined with the structural perspective is an
added strength. Overall, this manuscript provides for interesting and stimulating reading.
Minor points:
1. “…during the transition from a chordate with a single class of photoreceptor to a proto-
vertebrate with a duplex retina.” (abstract). This might be a moot point but if a proto-vertebrate is
defined as an organism emerging after tunicates but prior to 2R, it would have only cone-like
photoreceptors.
2. In some instances, additions of agnathan or other sequences distort unconstrained molecular
phylogenies, such as bird and agnathan GRK1s grouped together. The authors choose to omit or
constrain selected sequences to obtain seemingly correct phylogenies. Perhaps, pruning certain
sequences before MSA and tree reconstruction would also be helpful. Bird and agnathan GRK1s
have inserts with no known structural or functional significance (fig.3). Deletion of these inserts
will likely correct the unconstrained phylogeny.
3. Constraining phylogenies appears to artificially increase the bootstrap support for affected
nodes, which might be somewhat misleading ( e.g. fig. S2A vs S2B; fig. 5 vs fig. 6).
4. Few typos:

Appendix A
Response to Referees RSOB-17-0232
We thank both referees for their insightful suggestions, which we have attempted to incorporate
in full. We respond first to two major areas raised by the referees, about (1) the structure of the
paper and (2) the analysis of functional motifs, before responding to their other points.
1. Structure of the paper
Referee 1 states:
The manuscript is however unnecessarily difficult to read and assimilate, principally
because the authors have chosen to present Introduction, Results, and Discussion all
together. The Introduction in the submitted manuscript is very short and does not
sufficiently introduce the study or explain its rationale. Results and discussion are so
melded together that it is often difficult to tell when one ends and the other begins. As a
result, readers will have difficulty judging what part of the work consists of actual
findings, and what part interpretation based on those findings.
and:
the authors would greatly improve the presentation of their material if they would adopt
a more traditional format clearly separating their findings from their interpretation
We accept this criticism. The problem we face is the need to provide background, results, and
interpretation for each of multiple cases (GRKs, arrestins, RGS9s, Gß5s, and R9APs). To
achieve this, while also adopting the referee’s request that we use ‘a more traditional format’
(which we interpret to mean separate ‘Results’ and ‘Discussion’ main headings), we have now
introduced sub-headings to clearly denote the separation of background, results, and
interpretation. In addition, we have moved some interpretation to the Discussion section.
Finally, we have expanded the Introduction to outline our approach.
2. Analysis of functional motifs
Referee 1 states:
How essential is this description of GRK sequences to the main discussion of the paper?
Could it not be put in the supplementary material? As it stands, this discussion interrupts
the flow of the paper and seems more appropriate to a review article than to a research
paper. Much the same could be said of Fig. 8 and its attendant text.
whereas referee 2 states:
Careful consideration of the functional motifs in GRKs, arrestins and RGS9 combined
with the structural perspective is an added strength.
While we agree with referee 1 that the original placement of sub-sections interrupted the flow of
the paper, we concur with referee 2 that the analysis of functional motifs is a strength. Indeed,
we feel that this analysis is very important, and that moving it to Supplementary Material would
hide it under a bushel. Therefore, in balancing the referees’ views, we have chosen to move all
consideration of functional motifs out of the ‘phylogenetic’ section of the Results and into its
own new section. This has involved the shifting of blocks of text, as well as moving the
previous Figs 3 and 8 to later. There has also been consequential moving of Supplementary
Figures.
2
3. Other points
Referee 1:
In addition, I suggest that Tables 2 and 3 be omitted and their principal conclusions be
summarized in the text.
We have omitted Table 3. In relation to Table 2, we have moved the accompanying text to a
new Section 3.3 in the Discussion, so as to meet the referee’s earlier concerns about breakage of
flow and separation of interpretation from results. But we think that the Table itself provides a
helpful framework for the reader, in understanding the manner in which isoforms have been
inherited, and so we ask to be allowed to retain it.
This section about the bird GRKs is out of place and peripheral to the flow of the Results
section. It clearly belongs later in the paper in a discussion of possible difficulties in the
analysis, along (for example) with the grouping of lamprey and hagfish arrestin
sequences with Arr-C.
We agree. And we thank the reviewer for suggesting that we discuss possible difficulties. We
have accordingly created a new Section 3.2 in the Discussion entitled ‘Strengths and weaknesses
of our phylogenetic analyses’.
Referee 2:
1. “…during the transition from a chordate with a single class of photoreceptor to a
proto-vertebrate with a duplex retina.” (abstract). This might be a moot point but if a
proto-vertebrate is defined as an organism emerging after tunicates but prior to 2R, it
would have only cone-like photoreceptors.
Agreed. We have rewritten this sentence, and also made other changes to the Abstract.
2. In some instances, additions of agnathan or other sequences distort unconstrained
molecular phylogenies, such as bird and agnathan GRK1s grouped together. The authors
choose to omit or constrain selected sequences to obtain seemingly correct phylogenies.
Perhaps, pruning certain sequences before MSA and tree reconstruction would also be
helpful. Bird and agnathan GRK1s have inserts with no known structural or functional
significance (fig.3). Deletion of these inserts will likely correct the unconstrained
phylogeny.
In fact, we had already tried deleting those inserts, and we found identical topology and similar
support; we now state this explicitly. On the general issue of choosing only certain parts of the
alignments for subsequent tree construction, we chose (as stated in the Methods) to avoid
pruning of this kind, in order to minimise the possibility of unintentionally introducing bias.
3. Constraining phylogenies appears to artificially increase the bootstrap support for
affected nodes, which might be somewhat misleading ( e.g. fig. S2A vs S2B; fig. 5 vs
fig. 6).
Yes, that is indeed correct, and we now explicitly draw attention to it, both in the Methods and
in the main text.
3
4. Few typos:
Thank you. We have corrected all of these (though as much material has been moved, some of
the numbering has changed).
4. Other changes
One other change we have made is to briefly discuss whether it is possible to choose between
the two proposed gene duplication patterns for the arrestins in Fig. 5, on the basis of the gene
synteny results in Fig. 6; see third paragraph in Discussion Section 3.1.
Finally, we have made minor modifications to our wording in a number of places.
5. Summary
Overall, the principal changes in the revised paper are:
<U+F0B7> a new set of headings and sub-headings
<U+F0B7> the shifting of several sections of text (and their Figures/Table) to new positions
<U+F0B7> minor revisions to the Abstract
<U+F0B7> the addition of a new paragraph at the end of the Introduction
<U+F0B7> the addition of a new section in the Discussion on strengths and weaknesses
<U+F0B7> the addition of a final Conclusions section
<U+F0B7> consequential shifting of Supplementary Figures.
