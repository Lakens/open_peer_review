Comments to the Author

This manuscript is a clear and detailed review describing the current research showing changes
in the GABAergic system linked to HD. Compared to the glutamatergic system, the GABAergic
system has been for the most part overlooked during the last decades. This is a timely and useful
review of our recent knowledge in the field. Note that a more focused review, not cited in this
MS, has been published recently (PMID: 29464851).
Minor revisions:
1-Fig 1b displays the heteropentameric complex formed by a, ß, <U+03B3>,….subunits with a circle
illustrating the GABA binding site at the interface between 1 a and 1 ß subunit. There are 2
binding sites on such a complex (at the 2 a/ß interfaces). Both of them (or none) must be
illustrated.
2-Fig. 1b and and Fig. 3a suggest that GABAARs are on spine heads, this is not true. The 2 figures
should be changed accordingly.
3-page 8 chapter 3.3: In this chapter it is said that expression of NKCC1 is elevated at the
symptomatic stage while the function of KCC2 is lower. This should lead to seizure susceptibility.
Epilepsy has been reported in mouse models of HD but is not a hallmark of adult-onset of HD in
human (see point 6 below). These discrepancies (changes in chloride homeostasis leading or not
to epilepsy, animal models vs human HD….) should be discussed.
4-page 8: “neuroflammation” ?
5-Page 9 : “…because the KCC2 encoding gene, Slc 12A5, is highly enriched…” should be
“…because the KCC2 gene product, Slc 12A5, is highly enriched…” or “…because the KCC2
protein is highly enriched…”
6-Page 11: It is stated that “HD patients suffer from abnormalities…….and an increased incidence
of seizures”. While epilepsy is common in the juvenile form of HD, it is infrequent or virtually
absent in the adult-onset form (e.g. PMID:23124580). Actually, it has been shown that the
mutation carrier with an adult onset are less prone to seizure as compared to a non-carrier group.
This should be discussed.

Dear Prof. Glover:
Enclosed is a revision of our manuscript titled “Insights into GABAAergic system alteration in
Huntington’s disease” (manuscript no: RSOB-18-0165). We wish to thank you and the reviewers for
your helpful comments. We attempted to address each comment and question either in the body of the
revised manuscript or in this letter. Our responses to the specific comments of Reviewers are delineated
below.
Referee: 1
This manuscript is a clear and detailed review describing the current research showing changes in the
GABAergic system linked to HD. Compared to the glutamatergic system, the GABAergic system has
been for the most part overlooked during the last decades. This is a timely and useful review of our
recent knowledge in the field. Note that a more focused review, not cited in this MS, has been published
recently (PMID: 29464851).
RESPONSE: As the Reviewer pointed out, dysregulation of the GABAergic system is a timely issue.
We have cited the indicated review (PMID: 29464851) in the revised manuscript and would like to
thank the Reviewer for this suggestion (page 5).
minor revisions:
1. Fig 1b displays the heteropentameric complex formed by a, ß, <U+03B3>,….subunits with a circle illustrating
the GABA binding site at the interface between 1 a and 1 ß subunit. There are 2 binding sites on such a
complex (at the 2 a/ß interfaces). Both of them (or none) must be illustrated.
RESPONSE: We have modified Fig. 1b as recommended in the revised manuscript, and would like to
thank the Reviewer for point out this mistake.
2. Fig. 1b and and Fig. 3a suggest that GABAARs are on spine heads, this is not true. The 2 figures
should be changed accordingly.
RESPONSE: We have modified Figs. 1b and 3a as recommended in the revised manuscript, and would
like to thank the Reviewer for this suggestion.
3. page 8 chapter 3.3: In this chapter it is said that expression of NKCC1 is elevated at the symptomatic
stage while the function of KCC2 is lower. This should lead to seizure susceptibility. Epilepsy has been
reported in mouse models of HD but is not a hallmark of adult-onset of HD in human (see point 6
below). These discrepancies (changes in chloride homeostasis leading or not to epilepsy, animal models
vs human HD….) should be discussed.
RESPONSE: As suggested, we added a new paragraph in the revised manuscript to discussion this
issue (page 8, the last paragraph).
4. page 8: “neuroflammation” ?
RESPONSE: We corrected this typo into “neuroinflammation” in the revised manuscript (page 9).
5. Page 9 : “…because the KCC2 encoding gene, Slc 12A5, is highly enriched…” should be “…because
the KCC2 gene product, Slc 12A5, is highly enriched…” or “…because the KCC2 protein is highly
enriched…”
RESPONSE: We modified the indicated sentence in the revised manuscript (page 10) as suggested.
6. Page 11: It is stated that “HD patients suffer from abnormalities…….and an incresed incidence of
seizures”. While epilepsy is common in the juvenile form of HD, it is infrequent or virtually absent in
the adult-onset form (e.g. PMID:23124580). Actually, it has been shown that the mutation carrier with
an adult onset are less prone to seizure as compared to a non-carrier group. This should be discussed.
RESPONSE: We agree with the Reviewer and had included a paragraph to the revised manuscript
(page 8, the last paragraph; page 12).
7-Page 32, Fig. 2 legend “….through interacting with..” should be “….through interactions with..”
- “ …….disrupts the trafficking of GABAARs to synaptic memebrane”. Should be : “ …….disrupts
the intracellular trafficking of GABAARs to cellular membrane”.
RESPONSE: We corrected the indicated sentences as recommended in the legend of Figure 2.
Referee: 2
Excellent and clear review. I have no concern regarding this interesting manuscript
RESPONSE: We would like to thank the reviewer for this comment.
As we have discussed over emails in April, four review manuscripts (including this one) from the NPAS
(http://npas.programs.sinica.edu.tw/index_en.html) at Academia Sinica would be submitted to the
OPEN BIOLOGY and published together to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Academia Sinica. Dr.
Cheng-Ting Chien (the director of NPAS at Academia Sinica, ctchien@gate.sinica.edu.tw) recently
informed me that his manuscript would be submitted to the OPEN BIOLOGY at the end of November, a
little later than expected. Still, we would like to publish the four review articles from NPAS together in
the same issue in early 2019. Thank you so much for your help.
We would like to thank you and both reviewers again for their constructive critiques. We hope that you
and the reviewers will now find our paper acceptable by the OPEN BIOLOGY.
