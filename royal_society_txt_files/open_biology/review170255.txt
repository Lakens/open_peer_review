This manuscript reports the cryoEM determination at 4.0 angstrom resolution of a nucleosome on
a 183 bp DNA fragment from the ALB1 enhancer containing two FOXA1 binding sites. MNaseI
and DNaseI footprinting and thermal stability assays are also presented in support of a
hypothesis that the region around this pioneer transcription factor binding site is more loosely
bound within the nucleosome.
Although the authors deserve credit for solving this nucleosome structure, the ability to interpret
the results is limited.
The biggest difficulty is that the structure appears to be a weighted combination of at least 4
different atomic resolution structures, with separate "left" and "right" positions as well as
alternate orientations of the pseudodyad nucleosome symmetry for each. Combined with (or
perhaps as a consequence of) being just outside atomic resolution this means it is very difficult to
assess local flexibility of teh FOXA1 binding site DNA which is the main claim of the paper.
The representation of flexibility by colouring and filled volumes in figures 4 and 5 is inherently
qualitative and somewhat subjective. A better way to display this would be some type of plot of
the variation in fitted backbone positions.
Secondly, figures 1A and 2B/2C and the information in the text are not really sufficient for
readers to interpret the experiments fully. A more detailed figure specifying the position of the
FOXA1 binding sites and the interpreted nucleosome superhelical location (SHL) contact points
on the actual DNA base pair sequence is required.
The text should also put the observed positions in context with any published genomewide
mapping. Because in vitro nucleosome assembly at the ends of DNA fragments is a common
artefact, it is possible that the observed positions on this long DNA fragment could be irrelevant
and hence the localisation of flexibility on the nucleosome does not have a direct biological
interpretation.
A third more technical complication is that the comparison of in vitro stability relative to the 601
sequence is made difficult because the strong 601 positioning sequence will locate the nucleosome
in the centre of the fragment used whereas teh ALB1 posotions are at the ends. These different
geometries of the entry/exit DNAs could therefore affect enzyme accessibility. In fact the
distribution of footprints at the right end from the high throughput sequencing readout in figure
2C are surprisingly broad anyway, and deserves more interpretation and justification.
3
Finally, to maximise the informational value of the DNaseI footprinting in figure 6A it would be
useful to have some sort of semi-quantitative comparison based on plotting the differences in
accessibility using profiles down the lanes in figure 6A. A better higher resolution assay of local
DNA accessibility effects might have been Fe/EDTA hydroyl radical footprinting.
Overall, this manuscript addresses an interesting question about whether local flexibility of DNA
sequences facilitates access by pioneer transcription factors like FOXA1 using a structural
approach. Unfortunately, the data and discussion presented are not really strong enough to
warrant publication yet. A more quantitative and detailed analysis could turn this work into a

The paper " Cryo-EM structure of the nucleosome containing the ALB1 enhancer DNA sequence"
by Kurumizaka and colleagues determined the nucleosome structure containing the ALB1
enhancer (N1) sequence by cryo-EM at 4.0 Å resolution. The cryo-EM structure reveals that the
nucleosome structure with the ALB142 enhancer DNA is very similar with the previously
reported nucleosome structure with the Widom 601 DNA. However, as compared to the
nucleosome with the Widom 601 DNA, the ALB1 enhancer DNA contains local flexible regions
4
and is also less associated with the H3-H4 tetramer. The experiments in this study are well
designed and performed and results are very clean and clear. The manuscript is well written and
the conclusions are well supported by the data. I do have two small requests below, but it should
not require much more experimentation and after the change, I believe that the manuscript will
be very appropriate for publication in Open Biology.
Comment:
1). The authors did not compare their cryo-EM structure of ALB1 nucleosome with previously
reported crystal structure of MMTV nucleosome (Frouws et al., 2016).
2). In figure 6a, the authors performed DNase I digestion protection experiment to confirm their
cryo-EM structure of ALB1 nucleosome, however, it would be better to run a sequencing PAGE
gel to see the DNA regions with flexible structure.

This resubmisison has considerably improved clarity and informativeness of the manuscript. I am
very happy to recommend it for immediate publication.
I have a single recommendation that figure 6c and its legend are revised. This figure is important
because it effectively summarises the findings, yet it is a little unclear.
The axes labels at the top suggest that each bar represents the local resolution of the DNA,
presumably of each strand. The legend should state that two columns of bars are the strands.
The axis label for "Resolution" needs to be put above the scale bars, and the column label "DNaseI
hypersensitive sites" needs to be moved away from the right resolution scales to avoid confusion.
The same colours are being used for 3 different things in figure 6c: The resolution bars are
coloured using the yellow-green-red scale from figure 5c; red and yellow boxes are used for the
eG and eH sites following the colour in figure 2b; and the bars for the hypersensitive sites are in
red following the colour used in figure 6b.
Encoding the resolution both by colour and bar height is a duplication so the colouring could be
removed. The use of coloured bars for the DNaseI hypersensitive sites is superfluous so these
could be black bars. In fact, it would be more informative to plot a profile of the heights of the
DNaseI cutting activity alongside the resolution instead of simple bars if possible. Finally, the
yellow box for eH site is hard to see when printed, and the use of yellow for both eH and the left
nucleosome in figure 2b is confusing anyway. It would be useful to choose a different colour for
the eH site box in figures 2b and 6c, or to avoid colour altogether with a dashed line.

Comments to the Author(s)
Comment 1)
This manuscript reports the cryoEM determination at 4.0 angstrom resolution of a nucleosome on a
183 bp DNA fragment from the ALB1 enhancer containing two FOXA1 binding sites. MNaseI and
DNaseI footprinting and thermal stability assays are also presented in support of a hypothesis that
the region around this pioneer transcription factor binding site is more loosely bound within the
nucleosome.
Although the authors deserve credit for solving this nucleosome structure, the ability to interpret
the results is limited.
The biggest difficulty is that the structure appears to be a weighted combination of at least 4
different atomic resolution structures, with separate "left" and "right" positions as well as alternate
orientations of the pseudodyad nucleosome symmetry for each. Combined with (or perhaps as a
consequence of) being just outside atomic resolution this means it is very difficult to assess local
flexibility of the FOXA1 binding site DNA which is the main claim of the paper. The representation of
flexibility by colouring and filled volumes in figures 4 and 5 is inherently qualitative and somewhat
subjective. A better way to display this would be some type of plot of the variation in fitted
backbone positions.
Reply)
Thank you very much for these comments. To overcome the orientation problem in the cryo-EM
structure, in the revised manuscript, we reconstructed three-dimensional structures of the ALB1
nucleosome without imposing symmetry. We then successfully determined the ALB1 nucleosome
structure with the 186 base-pair DNA at 4.5 Å resolution. In this new structure, we took advantage
of the unequally-sized linker DNA ends to align and visualize the nucleosome particles consistently,
allowing the unambiguous assignment of the DNA sequence orientation. Since the right position is
the major nucleosome position (65%) within the ALB1 enhancer sequence, we mapped the ALB1
DNA sequence on this new ALB1 nucleosome structure. We then re-evaluated the local flexible DNA
regions on the ALB1 nucleosome structure. These new data are presented in the new figures 4 and
5, along with plots of the local resolution variations (new figure 6c), and the results are described in
the new sections, “Cryo-EM structure of the ALB1 nucleosome with a linker DNA” and “The ALB1
enhancer (N1) DNA structure in the nucleosome”.
In addition, in the revised manuscript, we performed ALB1 nucleosome DNaseI footprinting
experiments with the ALB1 nucleosome in the right position, and successfully mapped the local
flexible DNA regions in the nucleosome (new figure 6b,c). These data are consistent with the new
structural data, and are discussed in the revised manuscript (lines 178-184). Therefore, we believe
that these new structural and biochemical data support the main claim of this paper.
Comment 2)
Secondly, figures 1A and 2B/2C and the information in the text are not really sufficient for readers to
interpret the experiments fully. A more detailed figure specifying the position of the FOXA1 binding
sites and the interpreted nucleosome superhelical location (SHL) contact points on the actual DNA
base pair sequence is required. The text should also put the observed positions in context with any
published genomewide mapping. Because in vitro nucleosome assembly at the ends of DNA
fragments is a common artefact, it is possible that the observed positions on this long DNA fragment
could be irrelevant and hence the localisation of flexibility on the nucleosome does not have a direct
biological interpretation.
Reply)
As this reviewer suggested, we revised figures 1A and 2B/C, and described the experimental
procedures more clearly in the text (lines 90-92 and 111-117). In addition, we specified the positions
of the FOXA1 binding sites and the nucleosomal superhelical location (SHL) contact points on the
actual DNA base pair sequence in the right position. This information is presented in the new figure
6c. As the reviewer pointed out, the nucleosome has a tendency to position itself at the end of a
DNA strand in vitro. The left positioned nucleosome is actually an end-positioned nucleosome.
However, the right position is not an end-positioned nucleosome. In fact, the right positioned
nucleosomes are located a few base pairs away from the DNA end (figure 2b). This characteristic is
perfectly conserved when the DNA ends are extended by six base pairs (figure 2c). Therefore, the
right position may be the preferential nucleosome position on the ALB1 enhancer sequence. In the
genomic nucleosome mapping data, we confirmed that the ALB1 enhancer region forms
nucleosomes (refs. 14,16), but the precise nucleosome positions in the genome have not been
determined yet.
Comment 3)
A third more technical complication is that the comparison of in vitro stability relative to the 601
sequence is made difficult because the strong 601 positioning sequence will locate the nucleosome
in the centre of the fragment used whereas the ALB1 posotions are at the ends. These different
geometries of the entry/exit DNAs could therefore affect enzyme accessibility. In fact the
distribution of footprints at the right end from the high throughput sequencing readout in figure 2C
are surprisingly broad anyway, and deserves more interpretation and justification.
Reply)
Thank you very much for this suggestion. To eliminate the geometric difference between the
reconstituted nucleosomes, in the revised manuscript, we performed thermal stability assays with
the ALB1 and 601 nucleosomes containing 147 base pair DNAs. We then found that the H2A-H2B
and H3-H4 complexes associated more weakly with the ALB1 DNA than the 601 DNA. These new
data are presented in new figure 6d.
Comment 4)
Finally, to maximise the informational value of the DNaseI footprinting in figure 6A it would be
useful to have some sort of semi-quantitative comparison based on plotting the differences in
accessibility using profiles down the lanes in figure 6A. A better higher resolution assay of local DNA
accessibility effects might have been Fe/EDTA hydroyl radical footprinting.
Overall, this manuscript addresses an interesting question about whether local flexibility of DNA
sequences facilitates access by pioneer transcription factors like FOXA1 using a structural approach.
Unfortunately, the data and discussion presented are not really strong enough to warrant
publication yet. A more quantitative and detailed analysis could turn this work into a useful
contribution.
Reply)
As mentioned above, in the revised manuscript, we performed the DNaseI footprinting experiments
with the ALB1 nucleosomes in the right position, and successfully mapped the local accessible DNA
regions in this nucleosome position (new figure 6b). These data are consistent with the new
structural data. Therefore, we believe that these new structural and biochemical data support the
main claim of this paper.

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper "Cryo-EM structure of the nucleosome containing the ALB1 enhancer DNA sequence" by
Kurumizaka and colleagues determined the nucleosome structure containing the ALB1 enhancer
(N1) sequence by cryo-EM at 4.0 Å resolution. The cryo-EM structure reveals that the nucleosome
structure with the ALB142 enhancer DNA is very similar with the previously reported nucleosome
structure with the Widom 601 DNA. However, as compared to the nucleosome with the Widom 601
DNA, the ALB1 enhancer DNA contains local flexible regions and is also less associated with the H3-
H4 tetramer. The experiments in this study are well designed and performed and results are very
clean and clear. The manuscript is well written and the conclusions are well supported by the data. I
do have two small requests below, but it should not require much more experimentation and after
the change, I believe that the manuscript will be very appropriate for publication in Open Biology.

Comment 1)
The authors did not compare their cryo-EM structure of ALB1 nucleosome with previously reported
crystal structure of MMTV nucleosome (Frouws et al., 2016).

Thank you very much for this comment. In the revised manuscript, we compared the ALB1
nucleosome structure with the MMTV nucleosome structure. This comparison is presented in the
new figure 5b, and is described in the revised text (lines 161-163).
Comment 2)
In figure 6a, the authors performed DNase I digestion protection experiment to confirm their cryo-
EM structure of ALB1 nucleosome, however, it would be better to run a sequencing PAGE gel to see
the DNA regions with flexible structure.
Reply)
In the revised manuscript, we performed the DNaseI footprinting experiments with the ALB1
nucleosomes in the right position, and successfully mapped the local accessible DNA regions in the
nucleosome (new figure 6b,c). These data are consistent with the new structural data, and are
discussed in the revised manuscript (lines 178-184). Therefore, we believe that these new structural
and biochemical data support the main claim of this paper.
