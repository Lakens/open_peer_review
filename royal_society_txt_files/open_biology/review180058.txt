Understanding chromatin organization remains one of the basic issues in cell biology.
In this review paper, Olins et al. discussed “epichromatin” and “chromomeres” revealed by
immunostaining with monoclonal antibody PL2-6. Although this review paper focused on their
findings, their possible implications to the higher order-chromatin structure are intriguing and
thought provoking. I fully agree to the “unstructured stability” hypothesis proposed by the
authors. For publication in Open Biology, my specific comments are the following:
Major comments:
1) Lines 136. “Chromomeres appear to have “exposed” nucleosome acidic patches”. I wonder
whether transcribed regions, whose chromatin is rather extended and can have “exposed” acidic
patches, locate at surface of chromomeres/domains like proposed in PMID: 25563431.
2) Lines 155-159. Fig. 9.
The authors’ point is interesting. But considering size dimension of antibody molecule (~16nm x
12nm x 7nm), the drawing of Fig. 9 is confusing because the antibody is too large.
3) Lines 224-226. Fig. 10 “Nucleosomes possess ten inner histone IDPR tails [60] and two IDPR
histone H1 tails, becoming multivalent structures with numerous types of binding interactions
[38, 65] (Fig. 10A).”
I fully agree to this idea. Besides these two local “factors, clumping by cohesin might play an
important role in formation of the chromomeres (PMID: 28985562; Ref. 37). The authors might
want to discuss an involvement of cohesin.
4) Figure 10B. “A chromomere, contained within a membrane-less domain (~200-300 nm
diameter),) clamped by condensin (red ring) [71].“
Cohesin is more appropriate here, rather than condensin. In addition, what is the evidence that
the chromomere consists of 500-1000 nucleosomes?
5) Line 189-191. The authors might want to mention DNA replication foci domains. Recently a
new paper on characterization of the domains by super-resolution imaging was published
(PMID: 29572382)
6) Figure 10C. Lines 247-248. “Interphase epichromatin might be electrostatically attracted to
inner nuclear membrane anionic phospholipids. In mitotic cells, this charged nucleosome surface
may facilitate post-mitotic nuclear envelope reformation.”
Since cations such as Mg2+ can compete with this electrostatic interactions between epichromatin
and inner nuclear membrane, a recent report on a transient increase in free Mg2+ observed
during mitosis (PMID: 29358072) seems to be consistent with the authors’ notion.

Minor comments
1) Instead of “inner histone(s)” used in this manuscript, “core histone(s)” might be more
appropriate.
2) It might be better to make the Fig. 6 legend more concise.

The article by Donald and Ada Olins is summarizing their and colleagues long lasting studies on
the epichromatin and its epitopes revealed by specific antibody PL2-6 exploiting the data on
acidic path on the surface of nucleosomes. The application of this idea is very reasonable. The
vide in Supplementary is excellent.
The title: Epichromatin and Chromomeres: A “Fuzzy” Perspective
I do not think that the title is good. Such “fuzzy’ perspective may be misunderstood by the
readers as ironic.
What is really fuzzy – these are the tails of histones in nucleosomes, which are largely
4
unstructured and hence, conformationally adaptive . Adaptive to microenvironment – chromatin
surface and adaptive to clustering of the chromonemata sub-units known for a long as the
chromomers, as well adaptive to posttranslational modifications of histones. The hypothesis of
the “Unstructured stability” which is put forward by the authors is really very good in the sense
of modern thermodynamics.
I would not repeat the details of the recent article by Gould et al., Nucleus 2017, where the theory
of acidic path of the H2A+H2B nucleosome surface being substantially with low electrostatic
potential is applied for explanation of the mechanism of the bi-valent PL2-6 avidity to
epichromatin (earlier affinity of PL2-6 to these histones was shown by ElISA) was well explained.
I would suggest highlight here more physical generalizations. Avidity can be treated as a sum of
affinities but staining of the large nucleosome clusters by FAB fragment of the same antibody also
reflects the co-operativity – now due to the high nucleosome density of a substrate, which in my
view may be also unspecific in respect to antibody but specific to the nucleation by certain
sequences of DNA (satellites). It is well known that chromomers or bands of chromomers can be
revealed by Feulgen, Giemsa after trypsin or acid, BrdU inclusion, etc. Here nice superresolution
is used but this does not change the matter. This should be better discussed. I think that the
authors could still mention a bit of the chromomer history – chromomers were associated with
genes (the initial idea of Muller and Prokofyeva: one chromomere=one gene; bands are mapped
in Drosophila chromosomes, etc) and they as compared with TADs are still associated with
expression of genes.Just to cite MacGregor recent review is not enough. Genetics does not cancel
the physical laws of the nucleosome positioning and cooperative self-organisation, which is a
precious idea of this paper and in relation to chromatin organization, in general. However, not
mentioning the genetic component and giving the picture of Flemming (1882), while so much
work has been done afterwards, dissertations defended, and books written is really ‘fuzzy”. All
this work just cannot be an artifact (in my opinion).
Illustrations.
Fig.3 – a beautiful Osmium ammine reaction (specific but low sensitive - however nicely
highlighting the DNA component at the site of epichromatin) – I could not find the methodical
details or a reference in the Legend.
By the way, this picture shows that epichromatin can be defined by electron microscopy – the
reaction by Gautier as presented here or just by uranyl-acetate staining in conventional TEM. So,
to define it only through the specific antibody (in Introduction) is an error, in my view.
Fig.4 – interestingly that in some places DAPI-weak chromosome parts are strongly stained by
FAB and H1.5. As DAPI is more specific for AT stretches, does not it mean that “chromomers’ are
nucleated by GC-enriched material as shown recently for epichromatin domains by present
authors (Teif et al., Olins.., Nucleus 2017?) So, the FAB-positive foci would be Giemsa interbands,
is it? It can explain the absence of colocalisation with histone H1foci, which are not explained.
Fig.7 is very interesting as revealing a radial “chromomeric” pattern along a chromosome arm,
alternating with H1.5. This picture is not discussed but it poses a thought on the high level
rosette-like looping.
Fig.10C is interesting. A positively charged “cloud’ around epichromatin could explain its
inability to metachromatically stain with Acridine orange. However, the proteins of inner nuclear
membrane are said in literature to protrude with their N-domains into the nucleoplasm, so they
should be positively charged, is not it? This discrepancy should be discussed. On the other hand,
the epichromatin in general should be at least a bit negatively charged (otherwise, it would not
stain by uranylacetate in EM). But my view may be disputed. I only suggest discuss this cartoon
more explicitly.
5
In conclusion: May be rewriting the article shorter for the already published details and more
with a general physical and thermodynamic generalizations showing one of the guiding ways out
of the current blind corner of the chromatin organization, which is really ‘melting brains’, would
be recommended.

Mention was made that the “exposed” acidic patches of chromomeres could relate to
nscriptional “open” regions and the suggested reference was cited.
he Fig. 9 caption was rewritten to emphasize that this cartoon is not to scale, but that it is
wn to emphasize the complementary dyad symmetries of the zig-zag nucleosome acidic
ches and of the bivalent PL2-6 binding sites. Furthermore, the caption directs the reader to
Supplementary Video, which is presented accurately to scale.
nd 4) Cohesin and Condensin are both mentioned with appropriate citations within the Fig.
caption. We do not feel competent to decide between these candidates. It is an important
e, but it is also outside our thesis of “unstructured stability”.
suggestion that chromomeres might contain “~500-1000” nucleosomes is based upon
asurements and modeling from the Maeshima lab (references cited in Fig. 10 caption). This
ge of nucleosome numbers falls within a larger estimate discussed in the cited references.
approximate numbers are presented to provide an “order of magnitude”. Once again, we
eve that this issue is outside our thesis of “unstructured stability”.
We would rather not mention replication domains.
he suggestion of referring to a recent paper on the transient rise of Mg++ during mitosis is
y relevant. It is now mentioned in the text and cited.
or comment 1) We would rather stick to “inner histones”.
or comment 2) We feel that this “tiny bit” of chromatin history is not too lengthy.
eree: 2
We do not agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that we change the title of the article. We
se to include “Fuzzy” in the title to attract attention. It is a bit of “word play”, based upon
description of intrinsically disordered peptide regions, and quite relevant to the subject of
review.
We appreciate that the reviewer finds the “Unstructured Stability Hypothesis” to be “very
d”.
We find the large “sprawling” paragraph very difficult to comprehend. In sum, we believe
t the reviewer wants less description of the published data, more “physical generalizations”
more chromomere history.
bably, the reviewer has already read our Nucleus article (Gould et al, 2017). But we have to
ume that most readers are not familiar with our concepts and data relevant to epichromatin
chromomeres. We believe that some of our most informative micrographs should be made
ilable to most readers.
are not prepared to present more “physical generalizations”. Most of our data is
munofluorescence, not biophysics or molecular modeling.
eed, a more comprehensive history of the chromomere concept would be desirable.
wever, this is not the place (see Reviewer 1’s comments about the Fig. 6 legend). We share
reviewer’s passion that the “genetic component” is not an “artifact”. All of this belongs in
ther article.
strations:
3. In keeping with the request of reviewer 2, details on the use of OAB to stain DNA for
nsmission EM are given in the three references cited in the text, when Fig. 3 is discussed.
agree that the OAB staining adjacent to the interphase nuclear envelope may be considered
haracteristic of epichromatin; but only the specific immunostaining by bivalent PL2-6 (or
6) clearly distinguishes epichromatin from more internal chromatin.
4. We think that the reviewer is referring to Fig. 5, since Fab and anti-H1.5 are used in Fig.
ut not in Fig. 4. There is clearly not perfect co-localization between Fab (green) and anti-
5 (red). The reviewer’s interpretation is beyond the status of our data. Furthermore,
ermining co-localization is tricky, since manipulating the color intensities can yield (or
inate) the diagnosis of co-localization. We are currently exploring these questions by STED
ging, but are not prepared to make definitive statements.
7. We agree that this possible radial orientation of chromomeres is very interesting. It is
ussed in Gould et al (2017). However, here again, we feel that more data and analyses are
uired. Such studies are underway.
10C. The reviewer asks an interesting question: Are the inner nuclear membrane proteins
ic in the nucleoplasmic region? At least for LBR (lamin B receptor), the N-terminal ~100 aa
about 20% basic, comparable to the N-terminal ~40 aa of histone H1, but much less than
C-terminal ~100 aa. We agree that chromatin is probably polyanionic, surrounded by the
onic histone tail “clouds”. How this affects the fluorescence of acridine orange, we cannot
, not having investigated this question. Also, there is no data (that we are aware of) which
ntifies the amount of anionic phospholipid or the amount of LBR (or other inner membrane
teins) within the inner nuclear membrane. We do not feel that, given all of this ignorance,
re information can be added to the figure caption.
ally, we are loath to rewrite the article with shorter published details (We were invited to
te a review of epichromatin!) and expanded with physical and thermodynamic
eralizations (based upon nonexistent data). This would surely “melt brains”.
hor’s comment:
have also modified the Speculations and Hypothesis sections slightly. We attempt to make
ar that the unstructured regions of the histones might have binding partners that are DNA,
tein or membrane anionic phospholipids, broadening the potential range of their
ractions.
