Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
Nicely written introduction very wide ranging and perhaps a bit too long. It emphasises how
integrins are functionally important in many processes as they not only are agents to attach a cell
to the ECM they are also involved in intercellular signalling, partially indirectly, by “promoting
adhesion to the ECM so that cells are kept close to the source of signals”. No surprise then that
flies lacking integrins are devastated. So, the approach here, a familiar and well justified one, is to
make small clones lacking integrin function mys-, so that late requirements can be studied in
some isolation. The focus of attention is on ommatidial rotation, a late and interesting process
where small groups of cells rotate en bloc. This local loss of mys affects rotation in the imaginal
discs, while by the adult eye stage the mys- clones have become a complete mess.
More gentle interference with the myospheroid gene (localised and late overexpression under
sevenless control sev>mys) has a milder consequence causing defects of rotation and other
problems with the adult eye pattern. These flies can be used as a sensitised background to test for
the role of other proteins.
Evidence for link between integrins and ECM being required for rotation is reinforced when
other proteins involved in attachment to the ECM are also removed—the relatively weak mutant
phenotype induced by overexpression of mys is aggravated . The authors then build the evidence
that attachment to the ECM is instrumental in rotation by removing these other proteins in clones
and finding rotation defects. These methods demonstrate interactive requirement, they are not so
good at working out what the integrins and the other genes do, particularly as the effect of
overexpression is itself a mutant phenotype, and disturbing rotation is relatively unspecific.
Nevertheless the work raises some interesting if only suggestive ideas.
The authors then turn their attention to PCP using the overexpression of sev>mys flies as a
background. The key protein in PCP is Frizzled and its removal does not work on this assay.
Surprising….. maybe the authors should emphasise in the discussion that this jigsaw puzzle piece
does not fit. However, the loss of Vang, another PCP protein of less centrality than Fz, does
increase rotation defects. Even halving the amount of Flamingo has an effect in some special flies
overexpressing mys and this adds to the argument of an involvement of PCP in the rotation
process.
There are some relevant experiments that are missing, for example do nemo and E-cad mutations
increase the phenotype of sev>mys? What about testing the interaction the other way around? —
are PCP defects increased in a myo/+ background? Do myo/+ flies affect PCP non-autonomous
signalling?
Overall the authors have done a careful investigation of genetic interactions to build an argument
that some PCP proteins are involved,with the ECM, in rotation. The authors should make it
3
clearer that the investigation uses a rather blunt scalpel: these are compromised eyes, the
experiments combine one genetic sickness with another to deduce mutual dependency. Yes they
use the conventional experimental language of developmental genetics but the arguments that
they make are not watertight and some recognition of this should be made. Also, we are not
much wiser about what the wildtype mechanism is. Nevertheless I think the results are useful,
they widen the picture of rotation in an interesting way. Moreover, the whole paper is clear and
well written, the technical quality of the work is high and well presented with beautiful images,
detailed and convincing analysis of ommatidial orientations and we recommend that the paper
should be accepted subject to some revision.
About Figure 5:
The authors claim that during a short period there is an accumulation of myo protein around R1
and R6. However, this is difficult to see in the figure. The authors should consider using a better
image. Even if this finding is correct, the relevance is not clear, is the reader being taken on a
rather foggy trip for no purpose?

Thuveson and colleagues report on the function of integrins and the ECM during Drosophila eye
development, in particular during ommatidial rotation. They use loss of function clones and
genetic interactions with overexpressed dominant negative forms of integrins to show that
4
integrins are essential for proper ommatidial rotation and interact with planar cell polarity
signaling components, which are known to be important for ommatidial rotation. They show that
integrin localization changes dynamically during rotation and accumulates on cell membranes
facing outside of ommatidial clusters.
This is a beautifully illustrated and well-presented paper describing specific in vivo functions for
integrins and ECM components. The specific localization of integrins and how this is affected by
Drok activation is particularly interesting and provides new insights into the difficult question of
how ECM-integrins cause specific effects. I have only a minor suggestion: the rotation defects in
integrin mutant clones is clear, however, the quantification as presented does not really illustrate
the randomness and disorganization of the tissue. Maybe this could be illustrated by tabulating
the difference in angel between neighboring clusters.

This paper explores the role of integrins in eye development, in particular its role in ommatidial
rotation. The authors show that integrins are needed for the normal progression of ommatidial
rotation, using a clones of mutant allele of betaPS/mys, and overexpression of betaPS/mys
constructs that cause dominant negative effects. The authors explore the pathway of this integrin
function using genetic interactions, which show that reduction of a number of components of the
integrin machinery, actin machinery and PCP machinery are able to enhance the dominant
5
negative integrin construct phenotypes. This is a useful data set, but does not contain any
surprises, and also falls short of providing a clear mechanism for how integrins contribute to
ommatidial rotation. The value of the data set could be improved by 3 straightforward revisions.
1. The paper seems to be hinting that loss of integrin is unusual in that rotation is accelerated,
whereas other mutations that impair rotation just reduce the rate. The authors need to be more
explicit about this potential key difference and describe which mutants show accelerated rotation
or retarded rotation, both in the published literature and the experiments presented in this paper.
For example is there also acceleration in the perlecan and wing blister mutants shown in Fig. 6? Is
this a unique feature of loss of integrin mediated adhesion? This might imply that rotation is
primarily driven by lateral movement, and the basal attachment provides useful resistance to
regulate the rate of movement. Is it possible to image the cell shape from apical to basal, and see
whether the rotation is ahead at the top or bottom of the cell? This relates to recent work showing
that convergent extension can be lead by junction exchange either apically or basally.
2. Expand Table 1 to include mutations that do not enhance the phenotype. Just showing
mutations that enhance the phenotype leaves open the possibility than any mutation will do so.
Showing the specificity of this enhancement is therefore valuable, and it is just as interesting to
know the mutations that do not enhance as those that do enhance.
3. Allow a better comparison between the data in Table 1 and Fig 7.E. Using a different dominant
negative construct for the genetic interaction experiments is a very useful addition, and the
differences are especially interesting. However both data sets need to be displayed in the same
way so we can directly compare them. Either both in a Figure or both in Table 1.
