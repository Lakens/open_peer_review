I was surprised by the title of this manuscript “How to live without transcription factors: lessons
from the trypanosomatids” for two reasons. First, I expected it to centre on transcription, but this
is only a very minor part of the whole. In many respects, it is an update of a similar review on
gene expression by this author in 2016. Second, there is evidence - some of it very recent, some of
it dating back ten years - that these organisms do have transcription factors. Some of the basal
transcription factors were not identified previously as they are highly divergent (Srinistava et al.,
2018), others are recognisable orthologues of transcription elongation factors in other eukaryotes,
and a third set of factors involved in transcription are unique. One way to solve this would be to
change the title to something along the lines of “How to live with polycistronic transcription….”.
Alternatively, the author could write a more focused review outlining how concepts of
transcription in trypanosomes are evolving – this would be something new.
Major points:
The section on transcription would benefit enormously from being expanded to give a more
comprehensive account of findings in recent publications. Since the review is already rather long,
this could be balanced by condensing more speculative sections on RNA-binding proteins of
unknown function.
1. Transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase I (in particular the VSG expression
site in bloodstream forms) is partly tucked into the section on genome organisation and
transcription. The section on transcription by RNAPI is extremely brief (only half a page).
Specific factors required for transcription of bloodstream and metacyclic VSGs are not mentioned.
The whole issue of monoallelic exclusion is summarised in very general terms in just two
sentences. I disagree with the author that this is beyond the scope of this review. It should be a
central part of how trypanosomes can regulate expression with or without conventional
transcription factors.
2. RNA polymerase II. This section mentions the basal transcription factors recently identified by
Srinistava et al. and some transcription elongation factors, but in a rather cursory way. It should
at least be mentioned that they were identified because of their requirement for transcription of
the spliced leader precursor, which is also by RNAPII. It might be worth rephrasing a negative (it
is likely that they are used for polycistronic transcription, but this has not been tested) with a
positive (this is something that can now be tested fairly easily with ChIP-seq). It has recently
been shown that some RHS proteins bind both to spliced leader and polycistronic RNAPII
transcription units (see point 5).
3. The role of histone variants as markers of transcription start sites and termination sites (Siegel
et al., 2009) also deserves more thorough treatment as the way in which trypanosomatids, in
contrast to many other eukaryotes, define their transcription units.
4. The only reference to nascent RNA synthesis comes from an analysis of a region of Leishmania
chromosome 3 (Martinez-Calvillo et al., 2004) and omits a recent reference to the establishment of
GRO-Seq in trypanosomes (Florini et al., 2019).
5. The RHS proteins are dealt with extremely briefly and some recent data is omitted (Florini et
al., 2019). There are 7 RHS sub-families according to TritrypDB. The last one was not identified in
the original paper by Bringaud et al. (2002), most probably because it is barely expressed in
bloodstream and procyclic forms. RHS6 is not the only chromatin-associated RHS – RHS2 and
RHS4 are as well. Their co-localisation with RNAP II, analysed by ChIP-Seq, and their global
requirement for nascent RNA synthesis suggests that they are likely to be transcription
elongation factors. Since RHS only occur in the African and South American trypanosomes, this
suggests that these organisms have co-opted their own unique transcription factors. Might
4
Leishmania, Crithidia, etc have done something similar? A review seems a good place to raise
such questions.
6. Unpublished results from the author’s lab are cited on 9 occasions. A couple of paragraphs are
composed almost entirely of unpublished data. What is the journal policy on this?
Minor points:
7. page 2. T. cruzi epimastigotes are not the only forms in reduviid bugs. Metacyclics in the
hindgut are excreted and infect a new host.
8. page 8, line 1. Trans splicing sites are usually preceded by a polypyrimidine tract. Are there
any exceptions to this?
9. The section on alternative splicing is quite hard to follow, as is the figure. This section misses
references for UTRs affecting RNA turnover. A separate small section on the role of UTRs comes
on page 15. Wouldn’t it make sense to fuse these?
10. TRRM1 was shown to be essential in refs 129 and 131, before ref 130. The author focuses on its
RNA-binding capacity, but this ignores that it associates with PTB2 and RHS, which also ties it to
transcription. It also seems to be a chromatin remodeller and one of the major effects of depletion
was an increase in heterochromatin.
11. page 11. NMD3, which is also involved in mRNA export in trypanosomes, is not mentioned.
12. page 14. UFP1 seems to have a lot of other functions these days (see, for example, Kim and
Maquat, 2018).
13. page 21. Abundant RNA-binding proteins – can the author put numbers on these? Some have
been measured in the past.
14. page 22. Stress responses. Chromatin compaction is another response to heat shock (ref 131).
This could explain reduced transcription.
15. page 25. Since gene expression control is mediated by RBPs…. This is too narrow. By now
there is ample evidence that epigenetic and transcription factors are also important.
16. It is not clear why standard terms are often put in inverted commas.
17. There are a few typos in the manuscript, e.g. urudyliyl, becuase…
Figures
Figure 1. It is not clear why “metacyclic” is written in grey, and all other stages in black.
Figure 2. The author is entitled to reproduce a figure that she has published before – no problems
with that. The issues here are that it is extremely complicated and does not reflect recent findings
(e.g. co-transcriptional nuclear export of mRNA, Goos et al., 2018, participation of RHS in
transcription). On the same page as the figure (p.3) processing is referred to as post-
transcriptional.
Wouldn’t it be more appropriate to have a figure summarising what is known about mRNA
transcription by RNAPI and II?
5
Figure 3 is also very complicated for a general audience. The majority of splicing and processing
events are of type B, not type C. One could leave it at that.
Figure 4. I could not work out which results were from Leishmania and which were from T.
brucei. Maybe this could be colour-coded. At the same time, the activator/repressor colour code
could be removed. These data come from tethering assays and it is not clear if they also apply
under normal circumstances. Unpublished data from the author’s lab is apparently included. It is
not clear how extensive this is in this particular figure - it will also depend on the journal’s policy
(see point 6).
Figure 5. It would be helpful to use the same colours in this figure and figure 1.
It is not clear where the expression data come from. Do they refer to RNA or protein? How much
is published/unpublished?
The different scales of blue and grey are not so obvious on a printout – increasing contrast or
employing different colours would help.

Editor's comment:
Hi Christine: You'll see from the referees' reports that one is more favorable than the other. I think
you can deal with these comments as minor revisions but please take the comments into account
and let me know how you have addressed them.
This referee also remarks on your inclusion of unpublished data. I have no problem with
this...although we could take care of it by calling the article a perspective (or even "retrospective")
rather than a review.
Please get in touch with me directly if you would like to discuss this further.
Thanks again

pendix A
review article by Christine Clayton covers a tremendous amount of gene expression work in
anosomes and related organisms. It is a valuable and up-to–date review that includes
scriptional aspects and focuses on RNA metabolism, providing an astonishing amount of
ail for gene expression steps and pathways which often deviate significantly from those of the
del organisms. The review is well written and, undoubtedly, will be a great resource for
earchers in and outside the field of Molecular Parasitology. This reviewer has one major
cism and a few suggestions for Dr. Clayton to improve the article.
or Concern
his reviewer does not support the title because it is misleading. Trypanosomes possess all
asal transcription initiation factors for RNA pol II, TFIIIB for RNA pol III, and an essential factor
or RNA pol I. So far, ~40 proteins have been identified as part of essential transcription
nitiation factors. There are likely additional transcription factors such as TFIIIA and TFIIIC that
ave not been identified yet because they are extremely divergent from their eukaryotic
ounterparts. Dr. Clayton has published this misconception before and there are numerous
rticles which have reiterated this fact without reflection. What she really means though is that
rypanosomes lack DNA-binding transcription activators and repressors which account for
much of gene expression regulation in higher eukaryotes. Despite bringing a resonating quality
o the title, the generic expression “transcription factors” is not ideal.

…they include the plant parasites of the genus Phytomonas, and Leishmania and
rypanosoma species which cause diseases in vertebrates.”
age 5, first paragraph. In both cited references 16 & 41, the complex studied also contained
he unequivocal homolog of the small TFIIA subunit. This complex comprises SNAPc, TBP and
FIIA with one or two unique components, depending on whether you consider the third SNAP
rotein of SNAPc to be the homolog of human SNAP190 or not. TFIIA should be included in
he text though.
lthough this may be too much detail: all the other general transcription factors were shown to
e essential for SL RNA gene transcription in vitro as well, including TFIIH. As shown in other
ystems, TFIIH has helicase activity that, in addition to the described kinase function, is
equired to separate the DNA strands around the transcription initiation site.

olymerase”. Since all functional data so far are in line with TRF4 being the TBP homolog in
rypanosomes, I suggest to use the name TBP and say “originally termed TRF4”. In the long
un, this will be the better choice.

plicing and RNA pol II because depletion of spliceosomal components, f. ex. of PRP19

he supplemental tables are not well introduced in the main text. There needs to be a better
xplanation of what these lists are and how they were derived. How comprehensive are they?
or example, looking closer at the “4. Helicase” list, the DBP1/HEL64 annotation of
b927.10.6630 seems odd because, in TriTrypDB, this helicase is annotated as DBP2A and,
ccordingly, blasting its sequence against the human/yeast data bases revealed, as closest
matches, human DDX5 and its yeast homolog DBP2. In addition, the paralog of DBP2A,
BP2B (Tb927.8.1510), which is clearly a DEAD box RNA helicase, is not listed at all.

e. I've added a caveat to the Figure legend and the text.
he supplemental tables are not well introduced in the main text. There needs to be a better
lanation of what these lists are and how they were derived. How comprehensive are they?
example, looking closer at the “4. Helicase” list, the DBP1/HEL64 annotation of
27.10.6630 seems odd because, in TriTrypDB, this helicase is annotated as DBP2A and,
ordingly, blasting its sequence against the human/yeast data bases revealed, as closest
ches, human DDX5 and its yeast homolog DBP2. In addition, the paralog of DBP2A,
P2B (Tb927.8.1510), which is clearly a DEAD box RNA helicase, is not listed at all.
sheet now includes only the DEAD/H-box helicases that are in the cytoplasm. There are lots in the
leus (often, the nucleolus) and only a few have known functions. I think some of the names stem from
n the whole genome wasn't available. Someone (not me) would need to do some proper phylogeny
all these proteins in order to find out what they are doing.

Notes and the Table are introduced at the beginning of the review.
VIEWER 2
or points:
section on transcription would benefit enormously from being expanded to give a more
prehensive account of findings in recent publications. Since the review is already rather long, this
ld be balanced by condensing more speculative sections on RNA-binding proteins of unknown
tion.
ree that this would be interesting but I don't think that I am the ideal person. Maybe the reviewer might
h to do this once she has more analysis of the GRO-Seq results? Other possible authors are Arthur
zl and Nicolai Siegel.
review description at the beginning makes it clear that transcription is not covered in as much detail
ome other topics.
ranscription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase I (in particular the VSG expression site in
dstream forms) is partly tucked into the section on genome organisation and transcription. The
tion on transcription by RNAPI is extremely brief (only half a page). Specific factors required for
scription of bloodstream and metacyclic VSGs are not mentioned. The whole issue of monoallelic
lusion is summarised in very general terms in just two sentences. I disagree with the author that this is
ond the scope of this review. It should be a central part of how trypanosomes can regulate expression
or without conventional transcription factors.
nk that reviewing all this literature would add several pages (and another month of work). The field is
ing really quickly (lots of new factors in a recent meeting abstract book) and someone else could be
ed to review it. How about Gloria Rudenko? I think she would give a really balanced assessment of
ults from different labs.
NA polymerase II. This section mentions the basal transcription factors recently identified by
istava et al. and some transcription elongation factors, but in a rather cursory way. It should at least
mentioned that they were identified because of their requirement for transcription of the spliced leader
cursor, which is also by RNAPII. It might be worth rephrasing a negative (it is likely that they are used
polycistronic transcription, but this has not been tested) with a positive (this is something that can now
ested fairly easily with ChIP-seq).
mment added.
as recently been shown that some RHS proteins bind both to spliced leader and polycistronic RNAPII
scription units (see point 5).
roles of these proteins are mentioned but mechanisms are still very unclear.
he role of histone variants as markers of transcription start sites and termination sites (Siegel et al.,
9) also deserves more thorough treatment as the way in which trypanosomatids, in contrast to many
er eukaryotes, define their transcription units.
relevant variants are all listed - it's not clear to me what else there is to say. The "readers" haven't
n investigated yet, so far as I know.
he only reference to nascent RNA synthesis comes from an analysis of a region of Leishmania
omosome 3 (Martinez-Calvillo et al., 2004) and omits a recent reference to the establishment of GRO-
in trypanosomes (Florini et al., 2019).
paper in which GRO-Seq is described gives no details about the distribution of reads over
omosomes, mentioning only that the method is reproducible and that incorporation is inhibited by
letion of the RHS proteins. The reads are available but I assume that the authors intend to publish
ther, more detailed study. For me to do this in the context of the review would not be appropriate. In
meantime I have mentioned that the method exists. This is covered more fully in note 38/
he RHS proteins are dealt with extremely briefly and some recent data is omitted (Florini et al., 2019).
re are 7 RHS sub-families according to TritrypDB. The last one was not identified in the original paper
Bringaud et al. (2002), most probably because it is barely expressed in bloodstream and procyclic
s. RHS6 is not the only chromatin-associated RHS – RHS2 and RHS4 are as well. Their co-
lisation with RNAP II, analysed by ChIP-Seq, and their global requirement for nascent RNA synthesis
gests that they are likely to be transcription elongation factors. Since RHS only occur in the African
South American trypanosomes, this suggests that these organisms have co-opted their own unique
scription factors. Might Leishmania, Crithidia, etc have done something similar? A review seems a
d place to raise such questions.
tle more detail has been added about these proteins, but this is just one of 290 cited papers (not
uding the Notes). The mechanisms by which the RHS proteins act are not known so adding any more

TRRM1 was shown to be essential in refs 129 and 131, before ref 130. The author focuses on its
A-binding capacity, but this ignores that it associates with PTB2 and RHS, which also ties it to
scription. It also seems to be a chromatin remodeller and one of the major effects of depletion was an
ease in heterochromatin.
129 (Manger & Boothroyd, 1998) doesn't examine whether TRRM1 is essential or not, but I've added
131. PTB2 has also been postulated to be a splicing factor. The increase in heterochromatin could be
ondary since the results were obtained at a point when the cells had stopped growing.
