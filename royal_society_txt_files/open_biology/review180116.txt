label_comment_1
In this review, He Chun-Wei and colleagues try to put together rather fragmentary, sometimes
chaotic data involving Wnt molecules in different aspects of neuronal connectivity including the
development of axons, dendrites, and synapses. In my opinion, the topic is not mature enough to
write such a review. The reader is left with no clear idea on whether Wnts are really needed; and
if so, where and how Wnts affect these processes. This is due to 1) the fact that Wnts are
secreted/diffusible molecules that can act far from the site of production, 2) there are many Wnt
proteins (19 in mammals) with sometimes redundant functions that are difficult to grasp in single
mutants, 3) there are different membrane bound receptors, in addition to extracellular Wnt-
pathway mediators (Dikkopfs, norrin, sFRPs…), 4) most of the data derive from in vitro studies,
and 5) the little in vivo data is too patchy, has been collected from many experimental models,
and most of the time are indirect: based on analysis of Wnt receptors’ phenotypes (e.g: Fzds, Ryk,
sometimes even partners of receptors (i.e Vangls); rather than phenotypes of Wnt mutants.
Minor points:
Page 4, lines 8-10: remove or rephrase the sentence “Readers should keep these in mind….”
Page 4, line 15-16: The sentence “Readers that are interested in the mechanisms of Wnt signaling
are referred to other excellent reviews on this topic” is pointless, grammatically incorrect and
does not give any reference to reviews: Should be removed.
Page 5, Line 14: replace “divisional asymmetry of blast… ” by “asymmetric division of blast…”
Page 8: “The critical importance of Wnt-PCP is well supported by many studies that reveal
requirement for various PCP proteins in axon development…”. There are stronger in vivo
evidence that the one cited by the authors. These include the work by Nathans/Tissir/Goffinet
on Fzd3 and Celsr3 mutant mice. The implication of Vangl2 in axon guidance is controversial
because it is based on Vangl2 looptail allele which has a dominant negative activity (Please see
Yin et al, Plos One 2012; Qu et al PNAS 2014, Chai et al, Nat Neurosci 2014)
Page 14: “We would like to remind the readers that in the mammalian nervous system…” may be
rephrased as “We would like to stress that in the mammalian nervous system…”
Page 15: “One mechanism that Wnts stimulate the differentiation of synapses is through the
clustering or recycle of postsynaptic components” read as “One mechanism that Wnts use to
stimulate the differentiation of synapses is through the clustering or recycle of postsynaptic
components”
Page 16: Replace Celsr2 by Celsr3 in the sentence “In Celsr2/Flamingo conditional KO mice,
3
there is dramatic reduction in hippocampal CA1 glutamatergic synapses”. The Celsr2 mutants
have not been analyzed in the study by Thakar et al.
Pages 16-17: More direct evidences of Wnt implication in NMJ are provided by the works of
Legay, Strochlic, and Granato teams. Please refer to those works.

This is a well-written overview of the role of Wnt signaling on several aspects of neuronal
development. I only have some small remarks.
The authors need to refer to their figures in the text! Also the order of the different panels in Fig. 2
and Fig. 3 not always follows the order in the text. This should be amended.
On the top of page 5, the authors describe the ALM and PLM motor neurons in C. elegans. In the
figure and the figure legend, they are referred to as AVM and PVM.

Editor's comments:
Please revise your article to take into account the comments of both referees and indicate in a
cover letter to me how you have done so. You will see that one referee does not think that the
field is ready for review. However, this could be made to your advantage and in my opinion, it
would be good to acknowledge the difficulties of coming to a clear picture of the roles of Wnts in
this context in your article. Indeed, you might consider expressing (or paraphrasing) the
reservations that the referee has within your article.

Dear David,
Thank you for handling our manuscript. We have revised our
manuscript in response to the comments and suggestions by the
reviewers. Revision under reviewers’ suggestions is highlighted in
blue, and other modification is in red. Below is our point-to-point
response to the reviewers’ comments. We look forward to hearing from
you soon.

Reviewer 1 (R1) (A: Authors’ response)
(R1) In this review, He Chun-Wei and colleagues try to put together
rather fragmentary, sometimes chaotic data involving Wnt molecules
in different aspects of neuronal connectivity including the
development of axons, dendrites, and synapses. In my opinion, the
topic is not mature enough to write such a review. The reader is left
with no clear idea on whether Wnts are really needed; and if so, where
and how Wnts affect these processes. This is due to 1) the fact that
Wnts are secreted/diffusible molecules that can act far from the site of
production, 2) there are many Wnt proteins (19 in mammals) with
sometimes redundant functions that are difficult to grasp in single
mutants, 3) there are different membrane bound receptors, in addition
to extracellular Wnt-pathway mediators (Dikkopfs, norrin, sFRPs…),
4) most of the data derive from in vitro studies, and 5) the little in vivo
data is too patchy, has been collected from many experimental models,
and most of the time are indirect: based on analysis of Wnt receptors’
phenotypes (e.g: Fzds, Ryk, sometimes even partners of receptors (i.e
Vangls); rather than phenotypes of Wnt mutants.
(A) We thank the reviewer to point out several important issues of Wnt
signaling in the development of axon, dendrite and synapses. While
acknowledging these as critical unsolved issues, we think it helpful to
present a general overview on this topic as a guide for the readers
outside this field to explore more specific literature regarding Wnt
signaling and neuronal development.
Minor points:
(R1) Page 4, lines 8-10: remove or rephrase the sentence “Readers
should keep these in mind….”
(A) We removed this sentence.
(R1) Page 4, line 15-16: The sentence “Readers that are interested in
the mechanisms of Wnt signaling are referred to other excellent
reviews on this topic” is pointless, grammatically incorrect and does
not give any reference to reviews: Should be removed.
(A) This sentence is removed.
(R1) Page 5, Line 14: replace “divisional asymmetry of blast… ” by
“asymmetric division of blast…”
(A) This is corrected.

(Please see Yin et al, Plos One 2012; Qu et al PNAS 2014, Chai et al,

(A) We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We have cited
papers by the groups of J. Nathans and F. Tissir/A.M. Goffinet in the
revised manuscript.
(R1) Page 14: “We would like to remind the readers that in the
mammalian nervous system…” may be rephrased as “We would like
to stress that in the mammalian nervous system…”
(A) This is corrected as suggested.
(R1) Page 15: “One mechanism that Wnts stimulate the differentiation
of synapses is through the clustering or recycle of postsynaptic
components” read as “One mechanism that Wnts use to stimulate the
differentiation of synapses is through the clustering or recycle of
postsynaptic components”
(A) Corrected.

Celsr2/Flamingo conditional KO mice, there is dramatic reduction in

Please refer to those works.
(A) We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we have added

(R2) The authors need to refer to their figures in the text! Also the
order of the different panels in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 not always follows the
order in the text. This should be amended.
(A) We apologize for this mistake and have referenced the Figures in
the text. We also make sure that different panels in the Figures follow
their order of citation in the manuscript.
(R2) On the top of page 5, the authors describe the ALM and PLM
motor neurons in C. elegans. In the figure and the figure legend, they
are referred to as AVM and PVM.
(A) The Figure legend is corrected.
