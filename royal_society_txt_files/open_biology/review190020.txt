Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In their article, the authors investigate whether the coding sequence (CDS) of mRNAs is under
evolutionary selection with respect to the RNAs structuredness, i.e. base pairing potential. For
that purpose, the authors take over one million CDS from a total of 73 species from all domains of
life (incl. viruses) and, for each of them, predict base pairing probabilities which in turn give rise
to a single measure of structuredness, the degree of backfolding (DBF). To evaluate, whether a
DBF for a particular CDS is significant, the authors compare it against alternative open reading
frames (aORFs) obtained from three different background models. In particular, the aORFs
consist of codons that preserve the encoded protein sequence, but are (i) selected from a uniform
distribution, (ii) selected from the global codon usage of the respective organism, or (iii) derived
from shuffling the original open reading frame (oORF) of the CDS. This comparison then gives
rise to a DBF-score which ranges from 0 to 1 denoting that the oORF is less structured than
background, or more structured than background, respectively.
From this analysis, the authors find that indeed many CDS seem to be significantly more (or less)
structured than expected by the background model(s) throughout all kingdoms of life. In
particular, viral CDS appear to be exceptionally structured. Furthermore, the authors identify two
sets of codons that are over-represented in exceptionally structured, and unstructured ORFs.
Similarly, two sets of amino acids are determined which, again, lead to structured and
unstructured ORFs, respectively.
Along with their manuscript, the authors present a newly create software named PACKEIS that
given a set of ORFs creates aORFs for each of the background models mentioned above.
PACKEIS then computes the DBF and DBF-scores for the input data by utilizing the programs
RNAfold or RNAplfold of the ViennaRNA Package.
The article is very well written and sound. However, I have some minor remarks that still need to
be addressed.
1. The term 'high' and 'low' secondary structures that is used in the title and throughout the
manuscript sounds rather odd to me. Especially in the title, it is unclear what high and low
secondary structures could refer to. Since the authors associate structuredness in terms of the
DBF with it, I would suggest adding the term 'structuredness' or something similar.
2. Page 3, Results, second paragraph:
Here, the definition of DBF appears in textual form. This should be moved to the Methods
section, potentially associated with an equation.
3
3. Page 3, Results, second paragraph:
The definition of the DBF-score in this paragraph is not clear. The authors should add the
formal definition to the Methods section. What confuses me is the fact that "...DBF-score of 0
means that none of the aORFS exhibits a lower DBF, while a DBF-score of 1 means that none of
the aORFs exhibits a higher DBF". Assuming that a set of aORFs behaves exactly as the oORF,
what would be the resulting DBF-score? Please clearly state the definition of the DBF-score!
4. Page 3, Results, paragraph 2 + 3:
Some of this text should rather be moved to the Methods section as it explains what the
PACKEIS software actually does.
5. Page 3, Results, last paragraph:
The sentence "The PACKEIS software including ..." appears several times throughout the
manuscript. While a little redundancy usually doesn't hurt, it might be better to state the
'Availability' of the software only once, either in the Methods section when you explain in detail
what PACKEIS implements, or as a separate section 'Availability' at the end of the manuscript.
6. Page 9, Results:
for the amino acid identity analysis you create two sets of 10,000 random peptide sequences,
one consisting of amino acids that appear in structured, and the other with amino acids that
appear mostly in unstructured ORFs. From the text (even after reading the corresponding part in
the Methods section), I don't fully understand what are the oORFs and aORFs in this analysis.
After all, both are required to obtain the DBF-score if I'm not mistaken. Please clearly state what
constitutes oORF and aORF.
7. Page 9, Results, last sentence before Discussion:
The Figure you want to reference here is most likely 3e, not Figure 2e.
8. Page 11, Methods section:
I'm missing a brief description what PACKEIS actually implements, and how it performs it's
tasks. What is the input, what is the output, what goes on in the black-box?
You mention RNAfold and RNAplfold which are used mutually exclusive depending on the
length of the input ORF length. Please state whether these tools are run with default options or
not. For RNAplfold you state that it is used with option '-l 100'. While this should probably read '-
L 100' I wonder whether there are any other additional options passed to RNAplfold.
If not, I'd suggest adding the '-W' option with a window length at least 50nt larger than the
value used for '-L' to level boundary effects for the computed base pair probabilities. Note here,
that -L specifies the maximum allowed distance of two pairing nucleotides along the backbone,
while the -W option specifies the window that is used to average the pairing probabilities. (see
Bernhart et al. 2006, Bioinformatics).
9. Page 11, Methods section, "Quantifying the number of ORFs under structural selection"
The textual description of the s_low/s_high scores is a little bit confusing.
Please clarify:
(i) that you count the lowest/highest quantiles only if they are significant, i.e. p < 0.05 which
translates to Z-score >= 1.96.
(ii) what the s_low/s_high scores actually count. If I'm not mistaken, you are measuring the
excess of ORFs in the five quantiles with respect to the expectation. Please rephrase this
paragraph and clearly denote the parts of the text that correspond to the equation that follows
this paragraph, i.e. state what a_{Q k / 100) and z_{Q k / 100} is.
4
10. Page 12, Methods section, "Generating random peptides and ORFs" As already mentioned for
"6. Page 9, Results", the description for the second random peptide set is unclear. Please clarify
what are the oORFs and corresponding aORFs that are required for DBF and DBF-score
computation and averaging.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
Gelbert et al present evidence that a small percent of protein coding sequences show a non-
random degree of RNA secondary structure in species from all five kingdoms + viruses. The key
method develops a metric for RNA structure based on the number of nucleotide pairs predicted
by the ViennaFold algorithm and compares that to the number of nucleotide pairs predicted by
three 100x-shuffled variants to estimate the random expectation. The best controlled shuffle
variant maintains the same composition of the 61 codons, thus preserving GC content, amino acid
content and synonymous codon usage. Other variants allow the effect of amino acid content and
synonymous codon usage to be assessed. I find the principle claims to be true and interesting.
The Discussion is well balanced, making it clear that it is challenging to determine if there is a
selection on say amino acid content that is causing changes in structure or vice versa. The authors
may well be correct that the true degree of secondary structure under selection in protein coding
regions is larger than their analysis shows.

I hope the authors will consider the following.
1. Results, first sentence. The term “backfolding” is introduced without being defined. Why
“back”, why not just folding. Please define the term when it is introduced.
2. I am not suggesting changing the DBF-score, but it does not distinguish between genes with
many nucleotide pairs above or below random vs those with only one. The thresholding of
greater than or less than the DBF of the oORF prevents this. Would it be useful to present in
addition the distribution of, say, nucleotide pairs above or below the 100xmodel 2 background
for, say, the genes DBF-score <0.05 or >0.95? Is there a Gaussian or, perhaps more likely, a single
tailed distribution?
3. It might be worth pointing out that species with large effective population sizes are those
where codon preferences correlate strongly with tRNA abundances, whereas those with higher
mutational loads have codon usages that reflect neutral selection, such as GC content. e.g. dos
Reis and Wernisch 2009 mol biol evol 26, 451. Would it be interesting to test if species with the
structure bias correspond to those with higher or lower effective population sizes?
4. Given that synonymous codons for a given amino acid have closely related mono, di, and tri-
nucleotide frequencies and that RNA di- and tri-nucleotides have differing base stacking and
base pairing energies, it seems inevitable that any differences in amino acid or synonymous
codon usage between genes would result in different degrees of RNA secondary structure. e.g.
Mathews et al J mol biol 1999 288, 911. I would be tempted to make that explicit. (note to the
editor, shuffle model 2 shows that some of the unexpected structure observed is not due to
selection for amino acid or synonymous codon usage).
5. There is an interesting paper from Lai et al showing extensive folding of many mRNAs,
including their protein coding region. NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-
018-06792-z.
6. It is off putting that there is such a poor correlation in structure bias between orthologous
genes. Codon usage, by contrast, is known to be well conserved among orthologs. This is one
reason I am not compelled that the DFB-score is the most sensitive or best metric.

pendix A
r Dr. Peter Parham,
k you for the positive feedback on our manuscript entitled “Widespread selection for high and low
ndary structure in coding sequences across all domains of life”. We also want to thank the referees
heir constructive criticism and valuable suggestions that helped us to improve the overall quality of
paper. We have revised the manuscript according to their suggestions. Please find our point-by-point
onse below.
ewer 1
1. We agree that the term high/low secondary structure is not optimal and now use the alternative
terms “high/low structuredness” or “high/low levels of secondary structure” throughout the paper
as suggested by the reviewer.
2. We have moved large parts of this section including the corresponding figure to the Results section
and only provide a brief introduction including a description of the abbreviations oORF, aORF and
DBF (Note that Fig. 1 is now Fig. 3, the numbering of the other figures was changed accordingly)
We further agree with the reviewer’s opinion that readers would benefit from a clean
mathematical description of the DBF-score and added an equation to the textual explanation.
3. We have mathematically clarified the definition of the DBF-score (see point 2.) and briefly
elaborate on the case example mentioned by the reviewer since we believe that in fact many
readers would come up with the same question.
4. We have moved paragraphs 2 and 3 to the Methods section.
5. We have removed redundant availability statements. Information on software availability can now
be found in the Methods section, along with the description of the PACKEIS algorithm.
6. We regret this misunderstanding which was likely due to usage of the word aORF which is not
appropriate for this section and was now replaced by ORF. We further added the following
sentence to clarify this issue: “Note that in contrast to the analysis of set 1 and set 2 codons, we
did not compare aORFs that encode an identical peptide, but rather independent ORFs that code
for different peptides (set 1 and set 2 peptides)”.
7. This is true. We changed the text accordingly. Thanks for bringing this to our mind.
8. We thank the reviewer for this comment and have revised the according section to make the
procedure more clearly for the readers. We explain input and output files of PACKEIS and further
make clear that PACKEIS runs RNAfold and RNAplfold with default parameters. Unlike assumed by
the reviewer, the option -l is passed to PACKEIS (not to RNAplfold) and states the maximum length
of an input sequence to run RNAfold instead of RNAplfold. We have rephrased the corresponding
explanation to exclude any misunderstandings.
9. We provide a more detailed explanation, elaborating on the two points raised by the reviewer,
how we assess the number of genes under structural selection following the formula for
calculation of slow and shigh.
10. Based on the changes made according to point 6. we believe that we have now clarified this issue.
We also made sure not to use the terms “DBF” or “DBF-score” but “fraction of paired bases”.
ewer 2
1. We agree that the term “folding” is more frequently used in the scientific literature compared to
“backfolding”. Since we want to refer particularly to the base pairing of an mRNA with itself, rather
than formation of loops or other 2-/3-dimensional structures, we prefer the term “backfolding”
and added a definition of this term (“base pairing with itself through self-complementarity”) when
using it for the first time as suggested by the reviewer.
2. We agree with the reviewer in so far as the DBF-score not allows to say something about how far
a realized ORF structure is away from the ‘expectation’ as measured in additional/reduced paired
bases. While this is an interesting question per se, we rather attempt to make a statement on
whether an oORF behaves significantly different compared to the group of aORFs. Our data show
(we depicted some examples in figure 2a) that the fraction of paired bases for all aORFs of a given
oORF fairly follows a Gaussian distribution with slightly differing variance across different oORFs.
We can consider this Gaussian distribution as a probability density function and check the position
of the oORF relative to this distribution, assuming ‘unusual’ folding if the oORFs falls into the upper
or lower five percentiles of the distribution. This is independent of the absolute or relative distance
from the center of the Gaussian distribution which would represent something like the
expectation value for the number/fraction of paired bases. In other words, even a low number of
additional paired bases compared to the aORFs average could be very unusual for one specific
oORF, not or rarely reachable by random shuffling of synonymous codons (neutral evolution),
while even a high number of additional paired bases could lay within the standard deviation of
another oORF.
Nevertheless and in accordance with the reviewer’s opinion, we think that information on how
‘different’ an oORF can be from the ‘expectation’ assuming neutral evolution is important and
added the according information to Results section (“For the entirety of analyzed aORFs the
fraction of paired bases relative to the oORF follows a Gaussian distribution ranging from 91% to
109% compared to the oORF”).
3. This is indeed an interesting idea and we have again checked for any correlation regarding the
estimated number of genes under structural selection and (putative) effective population size (Ne).
However, the variance within unicellular eukaryotes or bacteria and archaea that typically have
very large Ne is so high that it covers the range displayed by multicellular eukaryotes. Similarly, no
difference between invertebrates (relatively large Ne) and vertebrates (relatively small Ne) can be
observed. We added this information to the Results section.
4. We absolutely agree with this statement. We have aimed to impart this difficulty in the third
paragraph of the results section but maybe missed to state it clear enough. We now spend some
more words on this issue and cite the paper mentioned by the reviewer.
5. This is indeed an important paper. We have included the main findings in the discussion section
and cite this study accordingly.

1. Please note that we have corrected an error in the following line: “[...] where f (Z<1.96)=0 and f
(Z=1.96)=1. For slow i=0 and j=4, for shigh i=96 and j=1.” where we have replaced “j=1” by “j=100”.
2. We realized that we have used the term “DBFscores” instead of “DBF-scores” several times in the
Methods section. We now use the term “DBF-scores” throughout the manuscript.
