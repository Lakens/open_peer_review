Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In this review article, the authors have provided up-to-date information regarding SUMOylation
and ubiquitination, two important approaches for protein post-translational modifications. They
have logically reviewed the SUMO family members, their crosstalk or correlation with
ubiquitination, their potential roles in the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, as well the
current approaches to identify SUMOylation sites on target proteins. Overall, this is a well-
organized review article, but the reviewer has the following major concerns:
1) There are lots of grammatical errors, including incomplete and/or fragmented sentences,
throughout the text; therefore, the manuscript needs extensive English language editing.
2) Most of the abbreviations should be spelt out in the text at the first instance.
3) More detailed information should be included in the section “3.1. SUMO is similar to ubiquitin
in structure”.

1. Introduction
Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) include phosphorylation,
glycosylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation and others[1]. As a
many
competitor of ubiquitylation, protein SUMOylation has become one of research
hotspots in recent years. SUMOylation is one of PTMs, in which a member of the
small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins is conjugated to lysine
residues in target proteins. SUMOylation modification is reversible and dynamic
process, in which the modified proteins can be deSUMOylated by SUMO-specific
proteases (SENPs)[2]. The reversible attachment of a SUMO to a protein is controlled
by an enzymatic pathway that is analogous to the ubiquitylation pathway [3].
realized
More and more research have found the importance of SUMOylation in the
normal function of the body[4].Along with the accumulating knowledge on its
biological functions, SUMOylation has been reported to regulate the subcellular
localization, protein-DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, transcriptional
regulation, DNA repair, and genome organization[5]. Moreover, there are abundant
evidences that the aberrance of SUMO regulation is highly associated with various
diseases, including cardiac disease[6], neurodegenerative diseases[7], and cancers[8].
2. SUMO family members
The SUMO family is a highly conserved and wildly exists in all eukaryotes,
which is required for viability of most eukaryotic cells. There is only one SUMO gene
SMT3 in budding yeast, while at least eight SUMO paralogs are present in plants [9].
In mammalian cells, SUMO proteins consist of four components, including SUMO-1,
SUMO-2, SUMO-3 and SUMO-4[3, 10]. SUMO1 is a ~11.6 kDa, 101-amino-acid
protein. The SUMO-2 shares 95% homology with SUMO-3. The SUMO-2 and
SUMO-3 differ from each other by only 3 amino (N)-terminal residues and have yet
to be functionally distinguished, but together they share only ~45% homology with
their paralogue SUMO-1[11]. Despite the low sequence homologies, while SUMO-1
and SUMO-2/3 share very similar three-dimensional structures. SUMO-4 is probably

non-conjugated under physiological conditions. A gene coding for SUMO-4 was
identified through analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 1
diabetes [12]. Other data suggests that the expression of SUMO-4 was increased in
pre-eclamptic placentas and in models of oxidative stress and hypoxic injury, SUMO-
therefore,
4 may be a potential post-translational mechanism in the stressed pre-eclamptic
placenta[13]. So far SUMO-4 is the least well characterized isoform.
Nevertheless, there are important differences between mammalian SUMO
paralogs. First, Some target proteins are modified exclusively by SUMO-1 in vivo[14],
other target proteins are conjugated to SUMO-2/3, or readily conjugated with all
paralogs. SUMO is important for cellular response to stress[15, 16], such as heat
shock, DNA damage and oxidative stress[5, 10]. But SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 show
different in vivo dynamics and responses to physiological stresses. The dynamic
properties of SUMO paralogues in HeLa cells confirmed that nucleoplasmic SUMO-1
is more resistant to bleaching than either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3[17]. So SUMO-1
dynamics is much slower than SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 dynamics.
3. Signal crosstalk of SUMOylation with ubiquitylation
3.1. SUMO is similar to ubiquitin in structure
Compared to SUMO and ubiquitin, SUMO has 18% identical to ubiquitin by
NMR[18]. According to amino acid sequence alignments of ubiquitin and the four
human SUMO homologs, similarities between each other exist. However, SUMO has
an N-terminal extension that is not found in ubiquitin[19], which is probably the key
point that SUMOylation has different cell biological function with ubiquitylation.
3.2. Biochemical process of SUMOylation and ubiquitylation
The biochemical process of protein SUMOylation is related to ubiquitylation.
Ubiquitin and SUMO, the most prominent members of a conserved protein family of
ubiquitin-like proteins, can be attached to lysine residues of target proteins via an
isopeptide bond [20]. The ubiquitin-like modifications are carried out in a three-step
4
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Page 5 of 28 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
cascade mechanism requiring the consecutive action of activating enzymes (E1s),
conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ligases (E3s). In human cells, ubiquitylation is
mediated by two E1 ubiquitin activating enzymes, approximately thirty-five kinds of
E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and a variety of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The
ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by receptors that contain ubiquitin-binding
domains (UBDs), and several specialized families of proteases, the deubiquitinases
(DUBs), remove ubiquitin modifications[21].
Similarly, the importance of an analogous modification, SUMOylation, is
becoming increasingly apparent recently. The biochemical process of SUMO
modification is similar to the conjugation pathway of ubiquitin (Figure 1), which is
performed in turn under the E1, E2, and E3 enzyme catalysis[19]. During
SUMOlytion, SUMOs are synthesized as propeptides that require cleavage to reveal
C-terminal di-glycine motifs by SENPs in mammals[22]. SUMO proteins are then
activated by an ATP-dependent heterodimer of SUMO activating enzyme subunit 1
(SAE1) and SAE2[23], which passes the activated SUMO protein onto the specific
and unique conjugating enzyme, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), through a
trans-esterification reaction and forming a high-energy thioester bond [24]. The Ubc9
usually acts in conjunction with an E3 ligating enzyme, then catalyses SUMO
conjugation to the substrate[25]. Finally SUMO conjugation forms an isopeptide bond
between the SUMO C-terminus and a e-amino group of a lysine within the target
protein [11]. A number of proteins have been discovered to have SUMO E3 activity,
including RanBP2, PIAS, the polycomb protein Pc2 and others[26], that enhance
SUMO conjugation to proteins. While the removal of SUMO modifications is
mediated by SENPs[27]. Members of SUMO pathway in mammal cells are
summarized in the Table 1. In addition, protein SUMOylation requires a consensus
SUMOylation motif in the target protein. For example, although there are many
lysines (K) in a SUMOylated protein, only a few of them could be true SUMOylation
sites. NMR studies have shown that the SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 interact
with the same N-terminal region of the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9 with similar
affinities. In general, many SUMOylation sites follow a consensus motif <U+03C8>-K-X-E or
5
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY Page 6 of 28
<U+03C8>-K-X-E/D(<U+03C8> is a hydrophobic amino acid, K is the target lysine, X is any amino acid
and D/E is aspartate or glutamate)[26].
A growing number of proteins have been reported to act as substrates for both
ubiquitylation and SUMOylation. The modified proteins have a wide range of
functions, which are mainly found in their modified substrates, there are lots of
examples in this paper[8]. These two modifications have many communications in
biological functions, including the control of signal transduction pathways, the
maintenance of chromosome integrity and genomic stability.
3.3. Correlation between SUMOylation and ubiquitylation mediated biological
functions
Although SUMO-modified amino acid residues are same lysines
as ubiquitylation sites, sometimes they are cooperated, and other times they are
competitively modified in vivo for proteins. SUMO modification usually increases
protein stability. For instance, the SUMOylation of Oct4 significantly increased Oct4
stability and its DNA binding ability [28]. While SUMO regulates the expression of
TRIM21 (TRIM21 as Oct-1 ubiquitin E3 ligase that controls the degradation of Oct-1),
so higher TRIM21 expression enhances Oct-1 ubiquitination and reducing Oct-1
stability consequently[29].
Some proteins can be simultaneously modified by SUMO or ubiquitin along with
different even opposite roles mediated by each modification. For example, SENP1
plays a key role in the regulation of the hypoxic response through regulation of HIF1a
stability. In this regulation process, HIF1a SUMOylation can serve as a direct signal
for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL [30]. PML could
be SUMOylated and ubiquitinated when exposed to arsenic trioxide. A pathogenic
fragment of HTT can be modified by both SUMO1 and ubiquitin at the same lysine
residue. The SUMOylation of HTT-fragment increases neurodegeneration, whereas
its ubiquitylation decreases neurodegeneration in a Huntington’s disease model [31].
SUMOylation of PES1 upregulates its stability and function via inhibiting its
ubiquitylation [32]. Posttranslational modification of PCNA can be modified by
6
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Page 7 of 28 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
ubiquitin and SUMO in response to DNA damage [33].
In conclusion, SUMO modification has been shown to compete with
ubiquitylation for common lysine residues in some cases. In other cases, SUMO
modification has been shown to cooperate with ubiquitylation to regulate biochemical
function.
4. Protein SUMOylation relates to disease
4.1. SUMOylation and cancer
Recently, there are many studies have shown that expression of the SUMO E1
activating enzyme (a heterodimer of SAE1 and SAE2), the SUMO E2 conjugating
enzyme (Ubc9) or the SUMO E3 ligases appears to be enhanced in numerous cancers
[8, 34-36]. The expression level of Ubc9 E2 is upregulated in adenocarcinoma and
ovarian cancer cells, and PIAS3 is also increased with different degrees in lung cancer,
breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer[8]. The enzymes involved in
SUMO modification is usually increased, which is closely related to the pathogenesis
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Such as, the expression of SAE1/2 is
significantly up-regulated in cancer tissues of HCC patients [37]. Survival rate of
patients with liver cancer is related to the expression level of SUMO2. The only E2
enzyme Ubc9 is overexpressed in HCC during SUMO modification[38].While
SENP2, which regulates the process of removing SUMO modification, can inhibit the
proliferation of HCC cells [39, 40]. Moreover, SUMOylation is important in the
development of multidrug resistance in HCC [41].
In addition, human tumorigenesis is closely related to SUMOylation and SUMO-
modified substrate proteins. SUMOylation is critical to cancer stem cell (CSC)
maintenance and self-renewal. Knockdown of SUMO activating enzyme E1 or
SUMO conjugating enzyme (E2) inhibits maintenance and self-renewal of colorectal
cancer stem cells [29]. The SUMOylated MAFB promotes colorectal cancer
tumorigenesis through cell cycle regulation[42]. Similarly,SUMOylation of Akt is
required for cell growth and tumorigenesis, and K276 is the major SUMO acceptor
7

site of Akt[43].
4.2. SUMOylation and cardiac disease
Recent studies show that protein SUMOylation plays an important role in cardiac
function, and a critical role of balanced SUMOylation/deSUMOylation is important
for proper cardiac development, metabolism, and stress adaptation[6, 44-46].
SUMOylation is attempted to treat cardiac disease. The increase of Ubc9-
mediated SUMOylation may represent a novel strategy for increasing autophagic flux
and ameliorating morbidity in proteotoxic cardiac disease[46]. The Ubc9/PML/RNF4
axis plays a critical role as an important SUMO pathway in cardiac fibrosis, which
provides an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of cardiac fibrosis and heart
failure by modulating the signal axis pathway [44].
4.3. SUMOylation and neurodegenerative disease
Neurodegenerative diseases often involve the formation of abnormal and toxic
protein aggregates, which are thought to be the primary factor in neurodegenerative
disease occurrence and progression. Accumulating evidences demonstrate
perturbations of neuronal SUMOylation contribute to numerous pathological
conditions and neurological disorders [7, 47, 48].
Huntington's disease
It is known abnormality of huntingtin (HTT) protein modification is associated
with Huntington’s disease (HD) [49]. A pathogenic fragment of HTT can be modified
by SUMO1 at the lysine residue, HTT-fragment SUMOylation increases
neurodegeneration in HD model. In addition, HTT SUMOylation increases the
degradation of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in the accumulation of HTT,
which finally leads to HD [31]. Other reports show HTT is modified by SUMO-2 to
modulate insoluble mutant HTT protein accumulation, and PIAS1 enhances SUMO-2
modification [49, 50].
Parkinson’s disease
SUMOylation is linked with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD)[51].
8
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Page 9 of 28 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
The a-synuclein has been verified to be SUMOylated preferentially by SUMO-1[52].
On the other hand, DJ-1 SUMOylation plays an intriguing potential role for PD. The
SUMO-modified substrate DJ-1 participates in the transcriptional regulation of genes
concerned with the cellular regulation of oxidative stress. Whereas DJ-1 mutation will
prevent SUMOylation and abolish all of its known functions [53, 54]. The PIAS
family members, as SUMO E3 proteins, interact with DJ-1 and stimulate its
SUMOylation in the process of eliminating ROS [51, 55].
Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is age-dependent, progressive neurodegenerative
disorder that is characterized by amyloid-ß (Aß) plaque formation [7],and the
presence of neurofibrillary tangles compose of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.
Previous studies indicated that SUMO-3 overexpression affects Aß levels [56].
SUMO-1 also modulates Aß generation via BACE1 accumulation [57]. The
SUMOylation of tau protein is also associated with the development of AD [58, 59].
Tau can be both SUMOylated and ubiquitylated [60]. Inhibition of the proteasomal
degradation pathway increases the level of tau ubiquitylation and decreases its
SUMOylation, suggesting that SUMO and ubiquitin might compete to regulate tau
stability [52].
4.4. SUMOylation and innate immunity
SUMOylation also involves in the replication of a large number of viruses, either
through the direct modification of viral proteins or through the modulation of cellular
proteins implicated in antiviral defense. There is growing evidence that SUMO
regulates several host proteins involved in intrinsic and innate immunity, thereby
contributing to the process governing interferon production during viral infection[61-
64]. SUMOylation of proteins have been implicated in the resistance to RNA viral
infection. For DNA viruses, SUMOylation promotes the stability of the DNA sensor
cGAS and the adaptor STING to regulate the kinetics of response to DNA virus [65,
66].
SUMOylation is a novel posttranslational modification for TBK1 [62].TBK1

kinase activity is required to allow the attachment of SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3 proteins.
And a SUMO modification at K694 contributes to the antiviral function of TBK1,
while the viral protein Gam1 antagonizes this posttranslational modification. Another
study identified SUMO1 was the key gene for inflammatory breast cancer [62].
TRIM38 acts as an E3 ubiquitin or SUMO ligase, which targets key cellular signaling
components, regulating the innate immune and inflammatory responses[67].
SUMOylation of NF-<U+03BA>B essential molecule NEMO augments NF-<U+03BA>B activity, NF-<U+03BA>B-
dependent cytokine production and pancreatic inflammation[68]. In summary,
SUMOylation has a deeply study recently, and its understanding could be vital for
developing potential therapeutic strategies.
5. Approaches to identify SUMOylation site
Nowadays, the identification of SUMO modification has faced several
challenges due to low abundance of most SUMOylated proteins. The approaches for
SUMOylation identification mainly include the bioinformatics coupled with the
amino acid site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics
analysis. We can predict protein SUMOylation sites by the analogue computation
bioinformatics, which is further verified by amino acid site-directed mutagenesis. In
addition, the variable SUMO modification sites of target proteins are identified by
MS-based techniques and the biochemical validation (Figure 3).
The identification of SUMOylation sites and SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) in
proteins is fundamental for understanding biological functions and regulatory
mechanisms of SUMOs. Recently several bioinformatics software is developed to
predict SUMOylation modification (Table 2), including SUMOsp [69, 70],
SUMOplot [71], SUMOpre [72], FindSUMO [73], SUMmOn [74], SUMOtr [75],
SeeSUMO [76], SUMOhydro [77] and SUMOhunt [78]. The SUMOsp and
SUMOplot approaches predict SUMO modification sites mainly based on the
conserved sequence <U+03C8>-K-X-E/D. Generally these bioinformatics methods focus on the
characteristics of a rigorous algorithm of the existing SUMO-specific sites on the
10
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob
Page 11 of 28 Submitted to Open Biology: FOR REVIEW ONLY
substrate proteins, and some even consider the protein space structure and
hydrophobicity. These bioinformatics prediction usually needs experimental data
validation.
5.1. SUMO modification site is identified by MS
Despite the powerful SUMO-modified prediction software provides a theoretical
basis for the prediction of SUMO modification sites, the precise identification of
SUMO modification sites is very important for investigating the target protein
functions. Recent advances in MS-based proteomics have greatly facilitated the robust
identification and quantification of PTMs [79, 80], including the SUMO modification.
The most common approach is to isolate the target SUMOylated protein by affinity
chromatography and to identify by MS [60, 81-83]. It is noted that this approach
requires the expression of a mutant form of SUMO, in which the residue preceding
the C-terminal Gly-Gly (diGly) is replaced with a Lys (SUMO (KGG))[84]. Digestion
of SUMO (KGG) protein conjugates with endoproteinase Lys-C yields a diGly motif
attached to target lysines. Peptides containing this adduct are enriched using a diGly-
Lys (K-<U+025B>-GG)-specific antibody and identified by MS. This diGly signature is
characteristic of SUMO(KGG) conjugation alone, as no other ubiquitin-like protein
(Ubl) yields this adduct upon Lys-C digestion[84].
MS-based identification of SUMOylated sites is hampered by the large peptide
remnant of SUMO proteins that are left on the modified lysine residue upon tryptic
digestion. Regarding this problem, tandem affinity purification can carry out a more
efficient enrichment of SUMOylated proteins by allowing the use of strong
denaturing conditions generally to remove most of the contaminant proteins[85].
5.2. SUMOylation site is confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis
The Lys site on a protein, possibly modified by the SUMO molecule, is usually
mutated to the Arg residue by site-directed mutagenesis to check biological function
changes. This classic biochemical method is very efficient to confirm the protein
SUMOylation site, but the throughput is not high as MS. For instance, the
11

SUMOylation of TARBP2 at K52 is found to require for regulating miRNA/siRNA
efficiency by this biochemical method [86].
5.3. Proximity ligation assays for detection protein SUMOylation in vivo
Detection of protein SUMOylation in situ by proximity ligation assays (PLA),
allows easy visualization of endogenous protein-protein interactions at the single
molecule level [87-90]. PLA relies on the use of combinations of antibodies coupled
to complementary oligonucleotides that are amplified and revealed with a fluorescent
probe, with each spot representing a single protein-protein interaction. In PLA, one
antibody is directed against the substrate ‘protein X’, while another targets SUMO-1,
SUMO-2/3, or ubiquitin. PLA could detect ‘SUMOylated protein X’ fraction, but also
“protein X” interacting with other SUMOylated proteins. PLA offers a quick, cheap
and ultrasensitive way for initial testing of ubiquitin-like modifications[91].
5.4. In situ SUMOylation assay
Another method is in situ SUMOylation assay [92, 93], which is based on the
fluorescence detection of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation in cultured cells. The
recombinant green fluorescence protein fused to the SUMO-1 (GFP-tagging SUMO1)
is used to visualize the nuclear rim, nucleolus, and nuclear bodies. These GFP signals
represent cellular regions where SUMOylation efficiently takes place. The
recombinant SUMO-specific protease SENP1 catalytic domain is added to erase GFP
signals when deSUMOylation happens. Some novel integrative technologies are
developed according to the above principles by now. A semi-intact cell system, in
combination with siRNA-based knockdown of nucleoporin RanBP2 [121], reveals a
modulatory role of RanBP2 in the nuclear rim and PML bodies.
6. Prospective
SUMO modification from the discovery has been more than a decade. SUMOs
have been established as essential regulators of many cellular functions. It is

considered to be one of the important factors regulating the function of the
intracellular protein, and the abnormal protein SUMOylation will lead to the
occurrence of the disease.
Recently, the relationship of protein SUMOylation and autophagy is gradually
underlying. Autophagy is a catabolic process that facilitates nutrient recycling via
degradation of damaged organelles and proteins through lysosomal mediated
degradation [45, 94-96]. Autophagy is one of the main mechanisms in the
pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. The accumulation of autophagic
vacuoles (AVs) in affected neurons is responsible for Aß production. By now,
previous investigation proved that SUMOylation is associated with autophagy.
Overexpression of SUMO1 increased autophagic activation, inducing the formation of
LC3-II-positive AVs in neuroglioma H4 cells [97]. Ubc9 overexpression induced
relatively high levels of autophagy and led to an increase in autophagic flux. While
Ubc9 depletion led to decreased LC3-II expression. This may represent a novel
strategy for increasing autophagic flux and ameliorating morbidity in proteotoxic
cardiac disease [6]. In reverse, autophagy can regulate UBC9 levels during viral-
mediated tumorigenesis. Ubc9 and autophagy are important co-factors to prime early
stages of HPV-mediated tumorigenesis [98].
With the development of bioinformatics and the continuous improvement of MS,
some more accurate and higher-throughput methods have been developed to explore
SUMO-modified substrates and sites. The deepening of the SUMO modification site
will help our understanding of the mechanism of some diseases. Protein
SUMOylation is promising for screening new therapeutic targets, providing a new
direction for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

Abstract
SUMOylation, as a post-translational modification plays essential roles in
various biological functions including cell growth, migration, cellular responses to
stress and tumorigenesis. The imbalance of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation has
been associated with the occurrence and progression of various diseases. Herein, we
summarize and discuss the signal crosstalk between SUMOylation and ubiquitination
of proteins, protein SUMOylation relations with several diseases, and the
identification approaches for SUMOylation site. With the continuous development of
bioinformatics and mass spectrometry, several accurate and high throughput methods
have been implemented to explore SUMO-modified substrates and sites, which is
helpful for deciphering protein SUMOylation-mediated molecular mechanisms of
disease.
Keywords: SUMOylation, SUMO pathway, deSUMOylation, disease
1. Introduction
Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) include phosphorylation,
glycosylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation and many others [1]. As a
competitor of ubiquitination, protein SUMOylation has become one of research
hotspots in recent years. SUMOylation is one of PTMs, in which a member of the
small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins is conjugated to lysine(Lys)
residues in target proteins. SUMOylation modification is reversible and dynamic
process, in which the modified proteins can be deSUMOylated by SUMO-specific
proteases (SENPs)[2]. The reversible attachment of a SUMO to a protein is controlled
by an enzymatic pathway that is analogous to the ubiquitination pathway [3].
More and more researches have realized the importance of SUMOylation in the
normal function of the body[4]. Along with the accumulating knowledge on its
biological functions, SUMOylation has been reported to regulate protein subcellular
localization, protein-DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, transcriptional
regulation, DNA repair, and genome organization[5]. Moreover, there are abundant
evidences to show the aberrance of SUMO regulation is highly associated with
various diseases, including the cardiac disease[6], neurodegenerative disease[7], and
cancers[8].
2. SUMO family members
The SUMO family is a highly conserved PTM form in all eukaryotes, which is
required for viability of most eukaryotic cells. There is only one SUMO gene SMT3
in budding yeast, while at least eight SUMO paralogs are present in plants [9]. In
mammalian cells, SUMO proteins consist of four components, including SUMO-1,
SUMO-2, SUMO-3 and SUMO-4[3, 10]. SUMO1 is one 101-amino-acid protein with
11.6kDa. The SUMO-2 shares 95% homology with SUMO-3. The SUMO-2 and
SUMO-3 differ from each other by only 3 N-terminal residues and have yet to be
functionally distinguished, but together they share only ~45% homology with their
paralogue SUMO-1[11]. Despite the low sequence homologies, SUMO-1 and SUMO-
2/3 share very similar three-dimensional structures. By now SUMO-4 is the least well
characterized SUMO isoform. SUMO-4 is probably non-conjugated under
physiological conditions. A gene coding for SUMO-4 was identified through analysis
of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 1 diabetes [12]. In addition,
the expression of SUMO-4 is increased in pre-eclamptic placentas and in models of
oxidative stress and hypoxic injury [13]. Therefore, SUMO-4 may be a potential post-
translational mechanism in the stressed pre-eclamptic placenta.
Nevertheless, there are important differences between mammalian SUMO
paralogs. First, most of target proteins are modified exclusively by SUMO-1 in vivo,
which is the dominant SUMO type among the four representative ones in mammalian
cells [14]. Some other target proteins are conjugated to SUMO-2/3, or readily
conjugated with all SUMO paralogs. SUMO is important for cellular response to
stress [15, 16], such as heat shock, DNA damage and oxidative stress [5, 10]. SUMO-
1 and SUMO-2/3 have different dynamics and responses to physiological stresses in
mammalian cells. For instance, the nucleoplasmic SUMO-1 is more resistant to
bleaching than the SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 in HeLa cells [17]. So cellular SUMO-1
dynamical transitions between SUMOylation and deSUMOylation take much time
than the modification dynamical reactions of the SUMO-2 and SUMO-3.
3. Signal crosstalk of SUMOylation with ubiquitination
3.1. SUMO is similar to ubiquitin in structure
In the aspect of the structure between SUMOs and ubiquitin, although the amino
acid sequence alignments exist 18% identical between ubiquitin and SUMO-1, they
have the same three-dimensional structure, especially ß sheet wraps a spherical
folding of a-helix[18]. In addition, the position of the two C-terminal Gly residues
required for isopeptide bond formation is conserved between ubiquitin and SUMO-
1[18, 19]. The biological effects of ubiquitination and SUMOylation are both largely
determined by the binding of proteins bearing specific interaction domains [20,
21]. However, SUMO has an N-terminal extension that is not found in ubiquitin[20],
which is probably the key point that SUMOylation has different cell biological
function with ubiquitination.
3.2. Biochemical process of SUMOylation and ubiquitination
The biochemical process of protein SUMOylation is related to ubiquitination.
Ubiquitin and SUMO, the most prominent members of a conserved protein family of
ubiquitin-like proteins, can be attached to Lys residues of target proteins via an
isopeptide bond [22]. The ubiquitin-like modifications are carried out in a three-step
cascade mechanism requiring the consecutive action of activating enzymes (E1s),
conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ligases (E3s). In human cells, ubiquitination is
mediated by two E1 ubiquitin activating enzymes, approximately thirty-five kinds of
E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and a variety of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The
ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by receptors that contain ubiquitin-binding
domains (UBDs). While the deubiquitinases (DUBs), a specialized family of
proteases, remove ubiquitin modifications [23].
Similarly, SUMOylation, an analogous modification of ubiquitination, is similar
to the conjugation pathway of ubiquitin in the biochemical process (Figure 1), which
is performed in turn under the E1, E2, and E3 enzyme catalysis[20]. During protein
SUMOlytion, SUMOs are synthesized as propeptides that require cleavage to reveal
C-terminal di-glycine motifs by SENPs in mammal cells [24]. SUMOs are then
activated by an ATP-dependent heterodimer of SUMO activating enzyme subunit 1
(SAE1) and SAE2[25], which passes the activated SUMO protein onto the specific
and unique conjugating enzyme, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), through a
trans-esterification reaction and forming a high-energy thioester bond [26]. The Ubc9
usually acts in conjunction with an E3 ligating enzyme, then catalyzes SUMO
conjugation to the substrate[27]. Finally SUMO conjugation forms an isopeptide bond
between the SUMO C-terminus and a e-amino group of a Lys within the target protein
[11]. A number of proteins have been discovered to have SUMO E3 activity,
including Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2), the protein inhibitor of activated STAT
(PIAS), the polycomb protein Pc2 and others[21], which enhance SUMO conjugation
to proteins. While the removal of SUMO modification from a protein is mediated by
SENPs [28]. Members involved in SUMO pathway in mammal cells are summarized
in the Table 1. In addition, protein SUMOylation requires a consensus SUMOylation
otif in the target protein. For example, although there are several Lys residues in a
protein, only a few of them could be true SUMOylation sites. The SUMO-1, SUMO-2,
and SUMO-3 interact with the same N-terminal region of the E2 conjugating enzyme
Ubc9 with similar affinities. In general, many SUMOylation sites follow a consensus
motif <U+03C8>-K-X-E or <U+03C8>-K-X-E/D(<U+03C8> is a hydrophobic amino acid, K is the target Lys, X
is any amino acid and D/E is Asp or Glu)[21].
A growing number of proteins have been reported to act as substrates for both
ubiquitination and SUMOylation. The modified proteins have a wide range of
functions, which are mainly found in their modified substrates [8]. These two
modifications between ubiquitination and SUMOylation have many communications
in biological functions, including the control of signal transduction pathways, the
maintenance of chromosome integrity and genomic stability.
3.3. Correlation between SUMOylation and ubiquitination mediated biological
functions
Although protein SUMOylation and ubiquitination both act on the Lys amino
acid residue, sometimes they are cooperated, and other times they are competitively
modified for a target protein. SUMO modification usually increases protein stability.
For instance, the SUMOylation of Oct4 significantly increased Oct4 stability and its
DNA binding ability during embryonic and germ cell development [29].While SUMO
regulates the expression of tripartite motif-containing proteins TRIM21, which
functions as the Oct-1 ubiquitin E3 ligase to control Oct-1 degradation. Therefore a
higher TRIM21 expression enhances Oct-1 ubiquitination and reduces Oct-1 stability
consequently [30].
Some proteins can be simultaneously modified by SUMO or ubiquitin along with
different even opposite roles mediated by each modification. For example, SENP1
plays a key role in the regulation of the hypoxic response through regulation of HIF1a
stability. In this regulation process, HIF1a SUMOylation can serve as a direct signal
for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of VHL [31]. PML could be SUMOylated
and ubiquitinated when exposed to arsenic trioxide. A pathogenic fragment of
huntingtin (HTT) protein can be modified by both SUMO-1 and ubiquitin at the same
Lys residue. The SUMOylation of HTT-fragment increases neurodegeneration,
whereas its ubiquitination decreases neurodegeneration in a Huntington’s disease
model [32]. PES1 is a component of the PeBoW complex, when stimulated by
estrogen, the SUMOylation of PES1 upregulates its stability and function via
inhibiting its ubiquitination [33]. Posttranslational modification of proliferating cell
nuclear antigen PCNA can be modified by ubiquitin and SUMO in response to DNA
damage [34].
In conclusion, SUMO modification has been shown to compete with
ubiquitination for common Lys residues in most cases. On the other hand, SUMO
modification also cooperates with ubiquitination to regulate biochemical function.
4. Protein SUMOylation relates to multiple diseases
4.1. SUMOylation and cancer
Recently, there are many studies have shown that expression of the SUMO E1
activating enzyme (a heterodimer of SAE1 and SAE2), the SUMO E2 conjugating
enzyme (Ubc9) or the SUMO E3 ligases appears to be enhanced in numerous cancers
[8, 35-37]. The expression level of Ubc9 E2 is upregulated in adenocarcinoma and
ovarian cancer cells, and PIAS3 is also increased with different degrees in lung cancer,
breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer[8]. The enzymes involved in
SUMO modification is usually increased, which is closely related to the pathogenesis
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Such as, the expression of SAE1/2 is
significantly up-regulated in cancer tissues of HCC patients [38]. Survival rate of
patients with liver cancer is related to the expression level of SUMO-2. The only E2
enzyme Ubc9 is overexpressed in HCC during SUMO modification[39].While
SENP2, which regulates the process of removing SUMO modification, can inhibit the
proliferation of HCC cells [40, 41]. Moreover, SUMOylation is important in the
development of multidrug resistance in HCC [42].
In addition, human tumorigenesis is closely related to SUMOylation and SUMO-
modified substrate proteins. SUMOylation is critical to cancer stem cell (CSC)
maintenance and self-renewal. Knockdown of SUMO activating enzyme E1 or
SUMO conjugating enzyme (E2) inhibits maintenance and self-renewal of colorectal
cancer stem cells [30]. The SUMOylated MAFB promotes colorectal cancer
tumorigenesis through cell cycle regulation[43]. Similarly,SUMOylation of Akt is
required for cell growth and tumorigenesis, and K276 is the major SUMO acceptor
site of Akt[44].
4.2. SUMOylation and cardiac disease
Recent studies show that protein SUMOylation plays an important role in cardiac
function, and a critical role of balanced SUMOylation/deSUMOylation is important
for proper cardiac development, metabolism, and stress adaptation[6, 45-47].
SUMOylation is attempted to treat cardiac disease. The increase of Ubc9-
mediated SUMOylation may represent a novel strategy for increasing autophagic flux
and ameliorating morbidity in proteotoxic cardiac disease[47]. The Ubc9/The
promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)/RNF4 (a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase)
axis plays a critical role as an important SUMO pathway in cardiac fibrosis, which
provides an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of cardiac fibrosis and heart
failure by modulating the signal axis pathway [45].
4.3. SUMOylation and neurodegenerative disease
Neurodegenerative diseases often involve the formation of abnormal and toxic
protein aggregates, which are thought to be the primary factor in neurodegenerative
disease occurrence and progression. Accumulating evidences demonstrate
perturbations of neuronal SUMOylation contribute to numerous pathological
conditions and neurological disorders [7, 48, 49].
Huntington's disease
It is known abnormality of HTT protein modification is associated with
Huntington’s disease (HD) [50]. A pathogenic fragment of HTT can be modified by
SUMO-1 at the Lys residue, HTT-fragment SUMOylation increases
neurodegeneration in HD model. In addition, HTT SUMOylation increases the
degradation of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in the accumulation of HTT,
which finally leads to HD [32]. Other reports show HTT is modified by SUMO-2 to
modulate insoluble mutant HTT protein accumulation, and PIAS1 enhances SUMO-2
modification [50, 51].
Parkinson’s disease
SUMOylation is linked with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) [52].
The a-synuclein, which highly expressed in the brain and associated with PD, has
been verified to be SUMOylated preferentially by SUMO-1[53]. The SUMOylation
of DJ-1 plays an intriguing potential role for PD. The SUMO-modified DJ-1
participates in the transcriptional regulation of genes concerned with the cellular
regulation of oxidative stress. Whereas DJ-1 mutation will prevent SUMOylation and
abolish all of its known functions [54, 55]. The PIAS family members, as SUMO E3
proteins, interact with DJ-1 and stimulate its SUMOylation in the process of
eliminating ROS [52, 56].
Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is age-dependent, progressive neurodegenerative
disorder that is characterized by amyloid-ß (Aß) plaque formation [7], and the
presence of neurofibrillary tangles compose of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.
Previous studies indicated that SUMO-3 overexpression affects Aß levels [57].
SUMO-1 also modulates Aß generation via accumulation of the Alzheimer's ß-
secretase BACE1 [58]. The SUMOylation of tau protein is also associated with the
development of AD [59, 60]. Tau protein can be both SUMOylated and ubiquitylated
[61]. Inhibition of the proteasomal degradation pathway increases the tau
ubiquitination and decreases its SUMOylation, suggesting that SUMO and ubiquitin
might compete to regulate tau stability [53].
4.4. SUMOylation and innate immunity
SUMOylation also involves in the replication of a large number of viruses, either
through the direct modification of viral proteins or through the modulation of cellular
proteins implicated in antiviral defense. There is growing evidence that SUMO
regulates several host proteins involved in intrinsic and innate immunity, thereby
contributing to the process governing interferon production during viral infection[62-
65]. SUMOylation of proteins have been implicated in the resistance to RNA viral
infection. For DNA viruses, SUMOylation promotes the stability of the DNA sensor
cGAS and the adaptor STING to regulate the kinetics of response to DNA virus [66,
67].
SUMOylation is a novel posttranslational modification for TANK-binding kinase
1 (TBK1) [63]. TBK1 kinase activity is required to allow the attachment of SUMO-1
or SUMO-2/3 proteins. And a SUMO modification at K694 contributes to the
antiviral function of TBK1, while the viral protein Gam1 antagonizes this
posttranslational modification. Another study identified SUMO1 was the key gene for
inflammatory breast cancer [63]. TRIM38 acts as an E3 ubiquitin or SUMO ligase,
which targets key cellular signaling components, regulating the innate immune and
inflammatory responses[68]. SUMOylation of NF-<U+03BA>B essential molecule NEMO
augments NF-<U+03BA>B activity, NF-<U+03BA>B-dependent cytokine production and pancreatic
inflammation[69]. In summary, SUMOylation has a deeply study recently, and its
understanding could be vital for developing potential therapeutic strategies.
5. Approaches to identify SUMOylation site
Nowadays, the identification of SUMO modification has faced several
challenges due to low abundance of most SUMOylated proteins. The approaches for
SUMOylation identification mainly include the bioinformatics coupled with the
amino acid site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics
analysis. We can predict protein SUMOylation sites by the analogue computation
bioinformatics, which is further verified by amino acid site-directed mutagenesis. In
addition, the variable SUMO modification sites of target proteins are identified by
MS-based techniques and the biochemical validation (Figure 3).
The identification of SUMOylation sites and SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) in
proteins is fundamental for understanding biological functions and regulatory
mechanisms of SUMOs. Recently several bioinformatics software is developed to
predict SUMOylation modification (Table 2), including SUMOsp [70, 71],
SUMOplot [72], SUMOpre [73], FindSUMO [74], SUMmOn [75], SUMOtr [76],
SeeSUMO [77], SUMOhydro [78] and SUMOhunt [79]. The SUMOsp and
SUMOplot approaches predict SUMO modification sites mainly based on the
conserved sequence <U+03C8>-K-X-E/D. Generally these bioinformatics methods focus on the
characteristics of a rigorous algorithm of the existing SUMO-specific sites on the
substrate proteins, and some even consider the protein space structure and
hydrophobicity. These bioinformatics prediction usually needs experimental data
validation.
5.1. SUMO modification site is identified by MS
Despite the powerful SUMO-modified prediction software provides a theoretical
basis for the prediction of SUMO modification sites, the precise identification of
SUMO modification sites is very important for investigating the target protein
functions. Recent advances in MS-based proteomics have greatly facilitated the robust
identification and quantification of PTMs [80, 81], including the SUMO modification.
The most common approach is to isolate the target SUMOylated protein by affinity
chromatography and to identify by MS [61, 82-84]. It is noted that this approach
requires the expression of a mutant form of SUMO, in which the residue preceding
the C-terminal Gly-Gly (diGly) is replaced with a Lys (SUMO (KGG))[85]. Digestion
of SUMO (KGG) protein conjugates with endoproteinase Lys-C yields a diGly motif
attached to target lysines. Peptides containing this adduct are enriched using a diGly-
Lys (K-<U+025B>-GG)-specific antibody and identified by MS. This diGly signature is
characteristic of SUMO(KGG) conjugation alone, as no other ubiquitin-like protein
(Ubl) yields this adduct upon Lys-C digestion[85].
MS-based identification of SUMOylated sites is hampered by the large peptide
remnant of SUMO proteins that are left on the modified Lys residue upon tryptic
digestion. Regarding this problem, tandem affinity purification can carry out a more
efficient enrichment of SUMOylated proteins by allowing the use of strong
denaturing conditions generally to remove most of the contaminant proteins[86].
5.2. SUMOylation site is confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis
The Lys site on a protein, possibly modified by the SUMO molecule, is usually
mutated to the Arg residue by site-directed mutagenesis to check biological function
changes. This classic biochemical method is very efficient to confirm the protein
SUMOylation site, but the throughput is not high as MS. For instance, the
SUMOylation of TARBP2 at K52 is found to require for regulating miRNA/siRNA
efficiency by this biochemical method [87].
5.3. Proximity ligation assays for detection protein SUMOylation in vivo
Detection of protein SUMOylation in situ by proximity ligation assays (PLA),
allows easy visualization of endogenous protein-protein interactions at the single
molecule level [88-91]. PLA relies on the use of combinations of antibodies coupled
to complementary oligonucleotides that are amplified and revealed with a fluorescent
probe, with each spot representing a single protein-protein interaction. In PLA, one
antibody is directed against the substrate ‘protein X’, while another targets SUMO-1,
SUMO-2/3, or ubiquitin. PLA could detect ‘SUMOylated protein X’ fraction, but also
“protein X” interacting with other SUMOylated proteins. PLA offers a quick, cheap
and ultrasensitive way for initial testing of ubiquitin-like modifications[92].
5.4. In situ SUMOylation assay
Another method is in situ SUMOylation assay [93, 94], which is based on the
fluorescence detection of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation in cultured cells. The
recombinant green fluorescence protein fused to the SUMO-1 (GFP-tagging SUMO1)
is used to visualize the nuclear rim, nucleolus, and nuclear bodies. These GFP signals
represent cellular regions where SUMOylation efficiently takes place. The
recombinant SUMO-specific protease SENP1 catalytic domain is added to erase GFP
signals when deSUMOylation happens. Some novel integrative technologies are
developed according to the above principles by now. A semi-intact cell system, in
combination with siRNA-based knockdown of nucleoporin RanBP2 [121], reveals a
modulatory role of RanBP2 in the nuclear rim and PML bodies.
6. Prospective
SUMO modification from the discovery has been more than a decade. SUMOs
have been established as essential regulators of many cellular functions. It is
considered to be one of the important factors regulating the function of the
intracellular protein, and the abnormal protein SUMOylation will lead to the
occurrence of disease.
Recently, the relationship of protein SUMOylation and autophagy is gradually
underlying. Autophagy is a catabolic process that facilitates nutrient recycling via
degradation of damaged organelles and proteins through lysosomal mediated
degradation [46, 95-97]. Autophagy is one of the main mechanisms in the
pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. The accumulation of autophagic
vacuoles (AVs) in affected neurons is responsible for Aß production. By now,
previous investigation proved that SUMOylation is associated with autophagy.
Overexpression of SUMO1 increased autophagic activation, inducing the formation of
LC3-II-positive AVs in neuroglioma H4 cells [98]. Ubc9 overexpression induced
relatively high levels of autophagy and led to an increase in autophagic flux. While
Ubc9 depletion led to decreased LC3-II expression. This may represent a novel
strategy for increasing autophagic flux and ameliorating morbidity in proteotoxic
cardiac disease [6]. In reverse, autophagy can regulate Ubc9 levels during viral-
mediated tumorigenesis. Ubc9 and autophagy are important co-factors to prime early
stages of human papillomavirus (HPV)-mediated tumorigenesis [99].
With the continuous development of bioinformatics and MS, several accurate
and high throughput methods have been implemented to explore SUMO-modified
substrates and sites, which is helpful for deciphering protein SUMOylation-mediated
molecular mechanisms of disease.

Figure legends:
Figure1. Biochemical process of SUMO modifications in mammal cells. All small
ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) paralogues are synthesized as pre-proteins that are
first cleaved by a SENP to expose a carboxy-terminal diglycine (GG) motif
(maturation). An ATP-requiring activation step by the heterodimeric E1activating
enzyme ( including SAE1 and SAE2 ) then generates a SUMO-SAE2 thioester.
SUMO is then transferred to the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9, again forming a
thioester. This last step usually requires a SUMO E3 ligase to bring about an
isopeptide bond between the SUMO C-terminus and a lysine within the target protein.
Figure2. Relationship of SUMO-modified proteins with different disease.
Different disease is related to SUMO-modified proteins, along with some examples of
representative proteins and SUMO pathway members.
Figure3. Several methods to identify SUMOylation site. SUMO modification sites
are predicted using bioinformatics software analysis. The prediction site is verified
using the following methods. (A) The SUMOylation site is analyzed through site
directed mutagenesis and Co-IP. (B) SUMO modification site is identified by mass
spectrometry.
