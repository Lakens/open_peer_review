This is a very comprehensive and well-written review of circulating biomarkers in neuroblastoma
which would benefit from some minor revision to make it suitable for a readership which might
not be so familiar with the neuroblastoma field.
1. The INSS staging system is so central to the discussion of each biomarker, that it deserves more
explanation in the introduction. A table would be useful.
2. ALK (and ATRX) should be defined at the first mention in section 1. For the readership of this
journal it could be useful to compare and contrast the nature of ALK activation in neuroblastoma
as opposed to other malignancies (lung cancer) at the first opportunity.
3. Figure 1 is very informative (although the text in the legend requires formatting), and although
the authors state that liquid biopsies have been reviewed extensively elsewhere, for the Open
Biology readers it would be useful to give some key examples of clinical translation for the
different types of circulating biomarkers in other malignancies.
4. Section 3.3 is very long. Subtitles here would be welcome.
5. "et al" is occasionally italicised, but mostly not.
6. Section 4 is a good translational summary and discussion which could be extended to provide
further "constructive discussion and/or critique of the field" (as per Open Biology guidelines).
The need for a final further summary (section 5) is questionable.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
4
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,

ar Buchi,
are delighted that our manuscript has been accepted for publication in Open Biology and would
to sincerely thank the reviewer for their time and very helpful feedback.
ase see below a point-by-point response to the reviewer’s comments. Changes in the
nuscript are shown in red.
The INSS staging system is so central to the discussion of each biomarker, that it deserves
re explanation in the introduction. A table would be useful.
have now provided Table 1 – a description of the INSS stages, and have also stated that the
S system is post-surgical.
ALK (and ATRX) should be defined at the first mention in section 1.
have now defined the biological roles of ALK and ATRX at the first mention.
the readership of this journal it could be useful to compare and contrast the nature of ALK
ivation in neuroblastoma as opposed to other malignancies (lung cancer) at the first opportunity.
have now contrasted the activation of full-length ALK in ALK+ NB with the fusion of ALK to
er oncogenes in ALK+ ALCL and NSCLC.
Figure 1 is very informative (although the text in the legend requires formatting), and although
authors state that liquid biopsies have been reviewed extensively elsewhere, for the Open
logy readers it would be useful to give some key examples of clinical translation for the different
es of circulating biomarkers in other malignancies.
have now formatted the text in the figure legend. We have now introduced two examples of
ically translated liquid biopsy tests: the Cobas test for EGFR mutation testing in NSCLC and the
LLSEARCH test for enumeration of CTCs in several cancer types.
Section 3.3 is very long. Subtitles here would be welcome.
have now split this section into three further sections: the first is an introduction to CTCs, the
ond is methodology of CTC detection and the third is association of CTCs with clinical features.
"et al" is occasionally italicised, but mostly not.
have now italicised every instance of et al.
Section 4 is a good translational summary and discussion which could be extended to provide
her "constructive discussion and/or critique of the field" (as per Open Biology guidelines). The
ed for a final further summary (section 5) is questionable.
have added some more narrative to the discussion on clinical implementation of circulating
markers in NB. We feel that the Summary is concise and brings the review to an end; however,
will leave the decision of whether to include or exclude the Summary with the Editorial team.
have also designed a graphical abstract to appear alongside our published article and feel it
uld also serve as a more informative Figure 1, so have substituted it.
ank you for your time and we look forward to reading the proofs of our manuscript in due course.
d regards,
ky Trigg
