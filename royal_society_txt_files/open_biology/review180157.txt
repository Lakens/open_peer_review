Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
This manuscript describes the author’s thoughts on an interesting and timely topic, that of de-
differentiation of cells for the purpose of tissue regeneration. The goal of the piece, stated in the
abstract, is to discuss how cell fate changes contribute to tissue regeneration, with a specific focus
on post-transcriptional mechanisms such as non-autonomous cell death, microRNAs, and
apoptosis-independent caspase activity. These different mechanisms are introduced and their
possible use in regeneration discussed in individual sections. Although the overall topic is
interesting, I had difficulty following the logic of some sections and in other sections wished I
was given more information.
The manuscript starts with a description of heterotypic ossification, or damage-stimulated ectopic
bone formation, by way of introducing a regenerative process in which cells undergo a fate
change to participate in tissue regrowth. My initial reaction was, what an odd and jarring way to
introduce regenerative processes (references to the Civil War, wounded veterans, etc). Although
I later (after reading the ms a few times) could see how HO relates to regeneration, it still seemed
less appropriate here than as justification in a grant application for relevance to human health. If
kept in this review, it would benefit from being more clearly integrated with the context of the
rest of the manuscript.
The author raises interesting ideas – e.g., that different examples of cellular plasticity (de-
differentiation, trans-differentiation, trans-determination, heterochronic cell fate changes etc.) are
as important as dedicated stem cells for tissues to undergo regeneration. However the discussion
of these different processes was often not easy to read. For example, a lot of space is given to the
let-7- lin-4 family of heterochronic miRs. Is the idea that this type of regulation is similar to cell
fate changes in regeneration? Or is it presented just to demonstrate how microRNAs function,
and how they could also function in regeneration? It was not clear to me. The discussion on non-
apoptotic roles for caspases could also use more information. I wished there was more
information about the removal of cell cycle inhibitors and the cleavage of Nanog in mouse ES
cells, both of which seem quite relevant. Likewise the section on autophagy, where interesting
examples are cited but not explained in much detail. If this review is meant for scientists, more
details seem appropriate. The final section (8) on relevance to human disease is quite confusing
(e.g., lines 268-271), and needs clarification. Finally, an overall summary might help bring
coherence to all of the ideas introduced in this review.

Dear Editors and reviewer,
Thank you for your time in assessing this manuscript. I really appreciate the encouraging
comments and am thankful for the critical comments. I have revised the manuscript to
address all comments as shown in detail below. I hope the revised manuscript is
acceptable for publication.
Tin Tin Su
Reviewer’s comments and author’s responses
1. Although the overall topic is interesting, I had difficulty following the logic of some
sections and in other sections wished I was given more information.
AU: I have made revisions, highlight in yellow, throughout the manuscript to
provide clarification and additional information as requested.
2. Although I later (after reading the ms a few times) could see how HO relates to
regeneration, it still seemed less appropriate here than as justification in a grant
application for relevance to human health. If kept in this review, it would benefit from
being more clearly integrated with the context of the rest of the manuscript.
AU: Please see changes in lines 31-34, made in order to better integrate HO to the
rest of the manuscript.
3. The author raises interesting ideas – e.g., that different examples of cellular plasticity
(de-differentiation, trans-differentiation, trans-determination, heterochronic cell fate
changes etc.) are as important as dedicated stem cells for tissues to undergo regeneration.
However the discussion of these different processes was often not easy to read. For
example, a lot of space is given to the let-7- lin-4 family of heterochronic miRs. Is the
idea that this type of regulation is similar to cell fate changes in regeneration? Or is it
presented just to demonstrate how microRNAs function, and how they could also function
in regeneration? It was not clear to me.
AU: Please see changes in lines 117-118, 125-125, and 127. Briefly, C. elegans
miRNAs are discussed as examples of the importance of post-transcriptional regulation to
cell fate change.
4. The discussion on non-apoptotic roles for caspases could also use more information. I
wished there was more information about the removal of cell cycle inhibitors and the
cleavage of Nanog in mouse ES cells, both of which seem quite relevant. Likewise the
section on autophagy, where interesting examples are cited but not explained in much
detail. If this review is meant for scientists, more details seem appropriate.
AU: Additional details on caspases and their targets have been added as lines
174-180. In the examples cited on autophagy in fate change, there was not really
additional relevant details to provide beyond what was already there in the original
manuscript, the detection of autophagy and the finding that inhibition of autophagy
interfered with regeneration. Therefore, I have not made changes to the autophagy
section.
5. The final section (8) on relevance to human disease is quite confusing (e.g., lines 268-
271), and needs clarification.
AU: I hope that revised sentences in lines 276-280 clarified this part.
6. Finally, an overall summary might help bring coherence to all of the ideas introduced in
this review.
AU: A conclusion paragraph has been added to the end.
