In addition to the well-studied lysine ubiquitination that is central to many biological functions,
there are multiple examples of ubiquitination on non-lysine residues including cysteines, serines
and threonines. This is a timely and very thorough review on the mechanism of non-lysine
ubiquitination and its cellular functions. It is also quite assessible. I have just a few minor
suggestions and comments that the authors might consider adding.
1. Since there is significant information available on non-lysine Ub in ERAD, it would be nice to
include a figure on ERAD and include the role of p97, which I do not believe is mentioned. The

fact that Ub modification of soluble proteins occurs as they emerge in the cytosol and the tails of
membrane proteins can be rather short, it might be reasonable to suggest that the variety of
amino acids that can be ubiquitinated might enhance the chance that misfolded ER proteins can
be modified and thus recognized by p97, which is central to the extraction of almost every ERAD
client that has been studied.
2. There is no mention of the toxins that enter the cytoplasm by being recognized as ERAD
clients. Many of these proteins are devoid of lysines, which makes them an interesting exception
in the context of this review. Perhaps this could be added to the concluding remarks at the end of
the review.
3. There are now data to demonstrate that the TCRa chains that are discussed are not integral
membrane proteins when they remain unassembled. Instead the charges that are critical to
assembly with CD3 subunits prevent their integration resulting in them localizing to the ER
lumen where they encounter the ER chaperones that target them for degradation. Maybe this
part could be moved to the section on lumenal ERAD clients.

This was a well-written, comprehensive and timely review on the subject of non-lysine mediated
ubiquitination.
I have a few, relatively minor comments and questions:
1 Is it correct to assume that the unbiased, systematic approaches to defining the ubiquitome, will
have missed the non-lysine targets – and therefore these will not be curated in any ubiquitin
proteome database – either way it would be helpful to have this topic discussed?
2 It’s remarkable how many of the viral targets appear to use non-lysine hydroxyester bonds.
This might be advantageous to the virus if there are indeed no hydroxyester-specific DUBS? This
might be worth discussing?
3 in the past decade – in abstract – first demonstration was in fact in 2005 – seems longer than a
decade?
4 Line 62 The 19S cap also contains deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), of which
approximately 100 have been described to date [2] – try to disambiguate this sentence. I
understand what they mean, but they don’t wish to give the impression that there are ~100 DUBS
on the proteasome..
5 Line 67 Moreover, ubiquitin removal by DUBs can provide a last way out for proteins
otherwise destined for proteasomal degradation [4, 5] – unclear what is meant here.
6 Line 80 uses the energy supplied by ATP hydrolysis
3
7 Line 377 BST2 is indeed the correct name, but it might also be useful to inform the reader
that it is often known by its other name i.e. tetherin?
8 Should be mentioned that Ube2j2 is itself a membrane embedded E2?
9 Line 623 ‘To our knowledge no DUB capable of releasing hydroxyester-linked ubiquitin
has been identified to date. This potentially suggests that serine/threonine ubiquitination may
serve as a label for commitment to degradation’…..Might be worth speculating that this is why it
is commonly used by viruses?
10 Line 719 Current evidence suggests that for RING type E3-mediated non-lysine
ubiquitination, serine seems to be preferred over threonine. What is the evidence for this?

llular functions and molecular mechanisms of non-lysine ubiquitination
ie J. McClellan et al.
int-by-point response to reviewers:
viewer #1, overall comment:
addition to the well-studied lysine ubiquitination that is central to many biological functions,
re are multiple examples of ubiquitination on non-lysine residues including cysteines, serines
threonines. This is a timely and very thorough review on the mechanism of non-lysine
quitination and its cellular functions. It is also quite assessible. I have just a few minor
gestions and comments that the authors might consider adding.
viewer #1, comment 1:
ce there is significant information available on non-lysine Ub in ERAD, it would be nice to
ude a figure on ERAD and include the role of p97, which I do not believe is mentioned. The
that Ub modification of soluble proteins occurs as they emerge in the cytosol and the tails of
mbrane proteins can be rather short, it might be reasonable to suggest that the variety of amino
ds that can be ubiquitinated might enhance the chance that misfolded ER proteins can be
dified and thus recognized by p97, which is central to the extraction of almost every ERAD
nt that has been studied.
swer:
pointed out, p97 plays a central role in ERAD by extracting substrates from the ER, a function
diated by binding to ubiquitin moieties on polyubiquitinated substrates. In our manuscript, we do
ntion that the variety of amino acids that can be ubiquitinated may enhance the chance that
folded ER proteins can be modified (lines 615-618):
us, as previously suggested [24, 25, 60], the finding that priming can take place on residues in
ition to lysine likely increases the chances of polyubiquitination by simply creating more sites
chain extension and thus secure more efficient substrate degradation.”
acknowledge the important role of p97 in ERAD, we have added the following text directly after
text cited above:
olyubiquitinated ERAD substrates are recognized and extracted from the ER by the AAA ATPase
[87]. This protein plays a central role in ERAD by unfolding ubiquitin moieties as well as the
strate protein itself to prepare it for degradation by the proteasome [88, 89]. Many sites of
yubiquitin attachment will thus increase the chance of p97 recognition and thereby ensure more
cient degradation”.
1
wever, our review focuses on non-lysine ubiquitination and not on the ERAD process as such,
we have not been able find any direct connection between non-lysine ubiquitination and p97
ction. Therefore, we have chosen not to include an ERAD figure (including the role of p97) in
revised manuscript.
viewer #1, comment 2:
re is no mention of the toxins that enter the cytoplasm by being recognized as ERAD
nts. Many of these proteins are devoid of lysines, which makes them an interesting exception in
context of this review. Perhaps this could be added to the concluding remarks at the end of the
iew.
swer:
thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point, which clearly deserves attention.
introduce the topic, we have added the following sentence (line 192-195):
ot only viruses exploit the ERAD pathway for their own purposes – a range of AB type toxins,
h as cholera, ricin and pertussis, use the ERAD pathway to gain access to the cytosol, where
y perform their deleterious functions ([31]; Section 4.1).”
mentioned by the reviewer, several of the AB type toxins show a paucity of lysines, presumably
a mechanism to avoid degradation. These findings have apparently never been put into context
on-lysine ubiquitination.
the revised manuscript, we now address this point after the sentence: “Whether non-lysine
quitination is especially important when lysine acceptor sites are sparse in substrates is
sently unclear”, where we have added the following (lines 625-635):
this context, it has been pointed out that several AB type toxins show an unusual paucity of
nes in their sequence [90], with the PTS1 subunit of the pertussis toxin protein being an extreme
mple, showing an arginine-to-lysine ratio of 22:0 [91]. The suggestion that this paucity of lysine
dues is caused by an evolutionary pressure to avoid ubiquitination and hence degradation, is
ported by experiments that show decreased cellular activity of these toxins when mutated to
tain (additional) lysine residues [31, 91]. To the best of our knowledge, similar experiments
ere additional serine, threonine or cysteine residues have been introduced, have not been
formed. Neither has a systematic analysis of serine/threonine/cysteine content been published
the AB type toxins.”

viewer #1, comment 3:
re are now data to demonstrate that the TCRa chains that are discussed are not integral
mbrane proteins when they remain unassembled. Instead the charges that are critical to
embly with CD3 subunits prevent their integration resulting in them localizing to the ER lumen
ere they encounter the ER chaperones that target them for degradation. Maybe this part could be
ved to the section on lumenal ERAD clients.
swer:
ight of this valuable comment we have now included a reference to the paper by Feige and
ndershot (Mol. Cell (2013), 51(3):297-309, and added the following text at the end of Section
.2 (lines 265-271):
otably, unassembled TCRa chains have been demonstrated not to integrate efficiently into the
mbrane, but instead localize to the ER lumen [46]. In essence, these chains can therefore be
sidered as soluble ERAD substrates (see below). It is interesting to note that the two very C-
minal (serine) residues become ubiquitinated, indicating that this substrate is retrotranslocated
h the C-terminus first and likely becomes ubiquitinated as soon as it enters the cytosol.”

viewer #2, overall comment:
s was a well-written, comprehensive and timely review on the subject of non-lysine mediated
quitination.
ve a few, relatively minor comments and questions:
viewer #2, comment 1:
t correct to assume that the unbiased, systematic approaches to defining the ubiquitome, will
e missed the non-lysine targets – and therefore these will not be curated in any ubiquitin
teome database – either way it would be helpful to have this topic discussed?
swer:
s is entirely correct – “unbiased” approaches to defining the ubiquitome are actually not
iased and, therefore, will miss non-lysine targets. Large-scale approaches, thus far, have been
cifically designed to detect ubiquitination only on lysine residues as they utilize an antibody
pared against a protein antigen containing diglycine-modified lysines (anti-K-e-GG; Xu et al.
bal analysis of lysine ubiquitination by ubiquitin remnant immunoaffinity profiling. Nat.
technol., 28 (2010), pp. 868-873). The few examples of ubiquitination on serine verified by mass
c were achieved by isolating only the protein of interest and examining post-trypsin mass spec
ks for those consistent with potential diglycine shifts (GlyGly(K), GlyGly(S), GlyGly(T), and
Gly(C); Chua, N. K., Hart-Smith, G., Brown, A. J. 2019 Non-canonical ubiquitination of the
lesterol-regulated degron of squalene monooxygenase. J. Biol. Chem.,
.1074/jbc.RA119.007798)). In some cases acetic acid was included to help preserve potential
r bonds (Weber, A., Cohen, I., Popp, O., Dittmar, G., Reiss, Y., Sommer, T., Ravid, T., Jarosch,
2016 Sequential Poly-ubiquitylation by Specialized Conjugating Enzymes Expands the
satility of a Quality Control Ubiquitin Ligase. Mol. Cell. 63, 827-839.
.1016/j.molcel.2016.07.020)). Altogether, this suggests the need for raising antibodies against
t-trypsin protein antigens bearing ubiquitin-modified cysteines, serines, or threonines to permit
ematic identification of the non-lysine ubiquitome. We have now added discussion of this (see
ow) and thank the reviewer for raising this issue so that readers may better understand why we
not currently have a sense of how widespread non-lysine ubiquitination is.
following text has been added (lines 771-776):
o date, global analyses of the ubiquitome have successfully enriched samples for ubiquitinated
ne residues through the use of antibodies specifically raised against a protein antigen
taining diglycine-modified lysines (anti-K-e-GG; [100]). The generation of antibodies that
ve this purpose for ubiquitin-modified serines, threonines, and cysteines would provide a means
xamine how pervasive non-lysine ubiquitination may be.”

viewer #2, comment 2:
remarkable how many of the viral targets appear to use non-lysine hydroxyester bonds. This
ht be advantageous to the virus if there are indeed no hydroxyester-specific DUBS? This might
worth discussing?
swer:
olutely. The following text (in bold) has been added to emphasize this point (lines 650-652):

t. For further consideration, if no DUB can cleave the proximal ubiquitin moiety………”

e been described to date [2] – try to disambiguate this sentence. I understand what they mean,

swer:
s text was definitely misinterpretable. We have attempted to disambiguate and also added a
re recent reference on predicted DUB gene numbers. The text (lines 61-64) now reads:
e 19S cap also contains two (S. cerevisiae) to three (most other eukaryotes) deubiquitinating
ymes (DUBs); over 100 DUB-encoding genes have been predicted in the human genome to date

tined for proteasomal degradation [4, 5] – unclear what is meant here.

swer:
e, we were trying to make the point that deubiquitination at the proteasome could potentially
e the protein from being degraded (if the rate of deubiquitination outpaces the rate of substrate
ding/unfolding/translocation/degradation). We have clarified the sentence, so that it now reads
es 68-69; new text in bold):
removal by DUBs may provide a last-minute opportunity for a protein to escape degradation

ke this statement at this time. The text has been modified to (line 747-748):
some cases of RING type E3-mediated non-lysine ubiquitination, serine seems to be preferred
