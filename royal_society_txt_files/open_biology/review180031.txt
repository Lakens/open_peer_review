Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The authors take on a topic that is important in the field and an important challenge.
The core of the paper is a literature review of genetics of response to treatment in psychiatric
disorders. This is not a literature I know well, and I found the summary useful. However, the
paper is given a spin of precision medicine, which I found forced and superficial. The paper did
not come across as authoritative in style or content. One suggestion is to shorten to be a review of
genetics of response to drug treatments to psychiatric disorder.

The manuscript from Stern and colleagues is timely review of previous efforts to predict response
to therapy in psychiatric disorders. There is an obvious need for new and better treatment
options in psychiatry, but there are undoubtedly opportunities to use available treatment options
more efficiently. Accurate prediction of which patients will respond to various treatment options
would reduce disease burden and cost in psychiatry. The authors do a good job of highlighting
attempts made to identify responders and non-responders in the major psychiatric disorders. I
believe including expanded discussion of the below issues would improve the manuscript:
1) In the section on bipolar disorder, there is a striking juxtaposition of the lack of reproducibility
among the SNPs and loci associated with lithium response and the electrophysiological data from
the authors’ laboratory that accurately identifies responders and non-responders. Unfortunately,
producing the electrophysiological biomarkers is time and labor intensive and therefore is not
practical for determining the best treatment course for a new patient. A way forward may be to
work backward from ephys, or other biomarkers with strong correlations, to identify common
genetic features that predict the biomarkers that predict response. This may be easier than trying
to directly link genotype to behavioral response in the clinic. Are there examples of these types of
studies that can be added and discussed in this review?
2) The general assumption is that precision medicine approaches will improve treatment
outcomes for patients. However, there is the likelihood that classification algorithms will produce
false positives and false negatives. What are the authors’ thoughts on what the minimum
accuracy rates should be for an algorithm before it is used? A discussion of some of the ethical
considerations would be a nice addition to the manuscript.
Assuming that the algorithms will not always produce an optimal outcome, should they be
designed to give multiple treatment options? For example, Patient A with MDD should first try
citalopram and then fluoxetine versus Patient B who should first try citalopram and then a
tricyclic. Also, should potential treatment side effects be incorporated?
3) In the legend for Figure 2 the authors state: “The ultimate classifier should use features
extracted from all of these methods, weigh them and provide a prediction based on all of these
data.” I do not think it is true that the ultimate classifier should use all possible inputs for a
prediction. The ultimate classifier would simply provide the best prediction accuracy. It is
possible that the added noise from additional inputs would overwhelm any additional signal
from those inputs.
Minor point
1) Page 2 Line 30 the gene is listed as CACNAC1. I believe it should be CACNA1C.

Decision letter (RSOB-18-0031.R0)
11-Apr-2018
Dear Dr Gage,
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0031 entitled "Prediction of
4
response to drug therapy in psychiatric disorders" has been accepted by the Editor for publication
in Open Biology. The reviewer(s) have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments
and revise your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material if applicable: this should be contained in a separate file
from the main text and meet our ESM criteria (see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-authors#question5). All supplementary materials
accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final form. They will be published
alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on
figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so that
the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.

Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section - if applicable
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
The Open Biology Team

Editors Comment:
Reviewer 1 suggests in comments to editor - "I suggest that the authors cut out the precision
medicine angle and simply keep the middle bit as a review of genetics in drug response in
psychiatric disorders". Reviewer 2 has some specific suggestions. Please modify the article to
address as many of the reviewers' comments as you believe reasonable and indicate your
responses to me a in a cover letter. Many thanks for contributing to Open Biology.
