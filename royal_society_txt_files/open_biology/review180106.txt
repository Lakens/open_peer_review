label_comment_1
This review from a leading autophagy lab gives a clear and exhaustive summary of methods to
study this process in vivo in vertebrates, focusing on zebrafish. I only have a couple of minor
points that the authors should address before publication.
Minor comments
1. line 39, "The membrane at the phagophore edges grow" please include a reference where this
was experimentally shown (that is, it grows at the edges and not everywhere or in the middle).
2. It would be helpful to italicize gene names.
3. line 125, fluorescent should be fluorescence I think.
4. line 267, strange characters appear in the pdf version
5. line 282, what are the "come photoreceptors"? or is it cone?
6. line 291, aspects OF vesicle...
7. line 360, Because green fluorescence from keima peaks at a wavelength emission of 620 nm...
620 nm light is not green. Perhaps the excitation is the same as GFP, and the emission differs?
Please explain.
8. Fig 2B depicts some increase of LC3-II in autophagy blocker samples because lysosome
blockers also induce autophagosome formation (mentioned in the figure legend). I believe
lysosome blockers have a temporal effect, that is, since they act on lysosomes their degradation
blocking effect becomes apparent before the indirect enhancement of autophagosome biogenesis
(via Tor inactivation). Please discuss this.
9. I know that review focuses on in vivo methods, but perhaps it could mention the available anti-
LC3 antibodies in zebrafish (if any) since Figure 2 shows western blot data.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
This is a review/ summary article on the autophagy system, with an emphasis on current
methods in autophagy assessment, and quantification of autophagy activity (flux). The review
covers vertebrate systems. The review is timely and covers new and state-of-the-art
methodologies in these areas, with an emphasis on fluorescent single and multi-probe detection
methods and other developing assay systems. For the most part, the review is well written. The
figure set is high quality, and will be of benefit to current investigators, for clear illustration of
autophagy assay methods.
Comment.
Conclusions section is focused on the importance of the methods development in understanding
autophagy flux relationships. As such, the significance is limited to providing research
tools/scientific development. This section could be expanded to close with a few statements
about the global importance of autophagy in disease pathogenesis, and the future scope of
therapeutics development and how understanding flux relationships will aid in therapeutics
development.

RE: RSOB-18-0106 entitled "Seeing is believing: methods to monitor vertebrate
autophagy in vivo"
Dear Editor,
Many thanks for your email of 6 August 2018. We were delighted to hear that this
review has been accepted. We have amended the paper to address the helpful
suggestions from the reviewers. We have addressed all the points as outlined
below.
Yours sincerely
David Rubinsztein
Referee: 1
1. line 39, "The membrane at the phagophore edges grow" please include a
reference where this was experimentally shown (that is, it grows at the edges and
not everywhere or in the middle).
You are right, it has not been experimentally established that the phagophore grows
in this way. We have amended the text so that it now reads “The phagophore
expands, engulfing substrates as it does so and eventually the edges fuse to form a
double-membraned vesicle, the autophagosome.”
2. It would be helpful to italicize gene names.
We have now italicised atg when we mention the atg genes. Most of the
manuscript describes the proteins involved in the autophagic pathway, hence in line
with gene/protein nomenclature guidelines, these are not italicised and are in
uppercase where appropriate.
3. line 125, fluorescent should be fluorescence I think.
Reviewer 2 also noticed this mistake and we have amended the text to “fluorescent
protein”.
4. line 267, strange characters appear in the pdf version
This is an error when the word file was made into a pdf during the online
submission. We will upload the revised manuscript as a word file and carefully check
the proofs for errors.
5. line 282, what are the "come photoreceptors"? or is it cone?
Yes, it is cone – we have corrected this.
6. line 291, aspects OF vesicle...
We have corrected this.
7. line 360, Because green fluorescence from keima peaks at a wavelength emission
of 620 nm...
620 nm light is not green. Perhaps the excitation is the same as GFP, and the
emission differs? Please explain.
We are very grateful to the reviewer for pointing out this mistake. In our editing of
earlier versions of the manuscript, we confused the description of the Rosella
reporter with dKeima. We have now rewritten the dKeima section and described it
in much more detail. See line 330-354.
8. Fig 2B depicts some increase of LC3-II in autophagy blocker samples because
lysosome blockers also induce autophagosome formation (mentioned in the figure
legend). I believe lysosome blockers have a temporal effect, that is, since they act on
lysosomes their degradation blocking effect becomes apparent before the indirect
enhancement of autophagosome biogenesis (via Tor inactivation). Please discuss
this.
We have altered the wording of the legend for 2A as it gave the impression that
autophagy blockers could induce autophagosome formation. We did not intend to
suggest that autophagy blockers induce biogenesis, merely that LC3-II levels can
increase when autophagosomes are not degraded. We think it would be over
complicated for the purpose of this review to discuss Tor inactivation in response to
lysosomal inhibition and so have not included that here.
9. I know that review focuses on in vivo methods, but perhaps it could mention the
available anti-LC3 antibodies in zebrafish (if any) since Figure 2 shows western blot
data.
In the legend to Fig.2 we have now listed some commercially available antibodies
that cross-react with zebrafish and have cited the papers in which these were used.

Conclusions section is focused on the importance of the methods development in
understanding autophagy flux relationships. As such, the significance is limited to
providing research tools/scientific development. This section could be expanded to
close with a few statements about the global importance of autophagy in disease
pathogenesis, and the future scope of therapeutics development and how
understanding flux relationships will aid in therapeutics development.
We have added to the conclusions section to highlight how these tools will be useful
in the study of disease and the design of therapeutics. See lines 401-405.
Line 55, 139 GABARAP needs definition – both GABARAP and MAP1-LC3 have now
been defined in the text and also in Table 1.
Line 120, define ALS – this has been defined.
line 125 fluorescent protein – this has now been corrected.
line 139 define CMV – this has now been defined.
line 229 mCherry – this has been corrected.
Line 267. Special characters missing.
This is an error when the word file was made into a pdf during the online
submission. We will upload the revised manuscript as a word file and carefully check
the proofs for errors.
Line 367 define YFP at first mention – this has now been defined.
Figure 1b. Some of the figure labelling, in particular LC3 in the membrane, is
rendered too small.
Figure 1b was been enlarged and the text size increased.
