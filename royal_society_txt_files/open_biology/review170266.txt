The review by Farache et al. discusses our current knowledge regarding the assembly and
regulation of gamma-tubulin complexes, which function as nucleators of microtubule nucleation
in all eukaryotes. This review is a nice, compact summary of some well-established and some
very recent data, including from the authors’ group. Coming from one of the field’s experts on
the topic, I have no major concerns, just a few comments and suggestions:
1) The writing style is extremely compact and to-the-point, which is generally a good thing, but in
some places I miss connecting sentences between paragraphs or ideas (e.g. between sections),
which would improve the overall flow of the next.
2) The abstract is missing Greek symbols, e.g. in gamma-TuRC. Also at the end of the abstract, it
is given the impression that the review would discuss gamma-tubulin complexes at specific
MTOCs, whereas in the main text there is not much of a real discussion of specific MTOCs,
instead the authors only occasionally refer to different MTOCs. One may want to remove
“specific”.
3) p.4, last sentence before section 3: references would be needed here.
4) I appreciate the use of a uniform nomenclature when referring to yeast proteins as GCP2 or
GCP3, as in humans. However, it may be useful to indicate at least initially the yeast protein
name (GCP3/Spc97p).
5) I don’t agree that MOZART1 can be described as oligomerization “chaperone” (the term
chaperone is used in multiple places throughout the text and legend), even if this term may have
been adapted from previous papers by others. The definition of a chaperone is a protein that
stabilizes other proteins by binding during their biosynthesis (folding helper) or upon their
partial denaturation (preventing aggregation, promoting refolding), however none of these
conditions apply here. Some chaperones may help assembling complexes, but they don’t remain
associated with the folded protein or assembled complex, contrary to MOZART1 in gamma-
TuRC.
6) p.4, section 4: It seems that Cota et al. (JCS, 2017) did not observe destabilization of gamma-
TuRC upon depletion of MOZART1. This may be an issue of depletion efficiency or timing, but
intact gamma-TuRC was observed under conditions where the amount of associated MOZART1
was clearly reduced – this difference with the Schiebel study should be at least mentioned.
7) p.5, intro section 5: The authors should explain better why it would be a “problem” if the
3
nucleation activity of gamma-TuRCs in the cytoplasm is not controlled – the concept that
spatially restricted nucleation is crucial to microtubule organization has not been established
properly in the previous sections.
8) p.5, first paragraph: the statement that ~20% of gamma-TuRCs is at MTOCs is not entirely
correct. First, I believe the references refer to centrosomal gamma-TuRC. Second, a recent study
(needs to be cited: Bauer et al, 2016, EMBO) by the Nigg lab determined a much lower value – as
low as ~1%!
9) p.6, second paragraph: I don’t understand the statement about testis-specific Cnn – my
understanding is that the cited paper shows that the Cnn isoform in testis targets gamma-TuRC
to the surface of mitochondria. Please change or explain.
10) p.6, section 6: this section provides very little evidence for a specific role of GCP4,5,6 in
regulation – most statements can also be made about GCP2 and GCP3. They also have N-terminal
extensions and regulatory proteins such as MOZART1 bind there (GCP3). The heading should be
rephrased or the authors should provide more evidence or at least speculation/discusssion
regarding this suggested specific role in regulation.
11) Section 7: the authors describe the sequence and function of TPX2’s suggested SPM and CM1
in analogy to the “classic” CM1 (referring to a recent paper by the Petry group), yet the
paragraph finishes by saying it is “remotely” comparable. Why remotely? The authors should
position themselves more clearly – do they consider the published data convincing or not?
12) Overall, I am missing that the authors more critically evaluate some of the published work, in
particular when it comes to recent, less well-established findings. This would be particularly
useful for the non-expert reader, who is typically not aware of controversial issues.
13) Figures: I would suggest to show domain structures for other regulatory proteins as well, not
just the GCPs (Fig. 1B). This could be done in a separate panel. Since the authors include
stoichiometries in their cartoons for some proteins, it is not very consistent to show only a single
molecule of TPX2 on gamma-TuRC exposing multiple TPX2 binding sites. Similarly, wouldn’t it
be expected that multiple chTOG molecules facilitate nucleation by a single gamma-TuRC?

Comments to the Author

Topical sections include: Introduction, composition of <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes, assembly of <U+03B3>-
tubulin complexes in fungal organisms, assembly of <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes in other eukaryotes,
activation of <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes, specific roles of GCPs 4,5, 6 in the recruitment and activation
of the <U+03B3>-TuRC, MT nucleation from augmin-bound <U+03B3>-TuRCs; influence of MAPs on the
nucleation process. The review is of potential interest to a wide spectrum of readers. However,
changes are recommended to make the review more accessible to non-experts in the field, include
additional important discoveries that impact the field, along with some of the historical context.
Comments:
1. The authors bring together in a concise review information from multiple studies of <U+03B3>-tubulin
complex proteins citing work from diverse eukaryotic model systems on the assembly and
regulation of <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes. The historical balance of work from multiple organisms is
generally sufficiently presented but misses much of the excitement of the early years in which <U+03B3>-
tubulin, spc97/Alp4, Spc98/Alp6 studies in budding and fission yeasts dominated the field and
aided identification of similar proteins from human, Drosophila and other eukaryotes. The
iterative and explorative nature of studies in multiple eukaryotic systems indeed has propelled
the field, particularly the identification of conserved functional domains, structural information,
biochemistry of complexes and cross-species functional studies. This interplay has been critical to
advance the field and should be directly stated.
2. For those less familiar with the microtubule cytoskeleton field, the review should provide a few
more sentences to enlighten readers on the powerful and diverse roles of the microtubule
cytoskeleton. Mentioned are cell division and directional intracellular transport- but not the
foundational role of microtubules in enabling specialized cellular structures and functional
capabilities in diverse eukaryotes as well as differentiated animal cells. The terminology of
MTOC is also broadly used and the authors should cite relevant reviews [PMID: 17245416; PMID:
3916316] to give readers additional background.
3. In the description of the composition of <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes, the single turn overlapping
structure might better be described as a creating a lockwasher [PMID: 10854328] that appears as a
ring from above.
4. The stoichiometry of the <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes has been largely defined biochemically by
multiple studies, a point which should be mentioned and references cited.
5. The in vitro nucleation differences between <U+03B3>-TuSC and <U+03B3>-TuRC and associated proteins
were also noted by earlier studies in budding yeast [PMID: 11950928]. The authors both state that
5
<U+03B3>-TuSC nucleates poorly and that it doesn’t nucleate at all (top of page 4), the latter should be
removed.
6. Missing from discussions of associated proteins, particularly when regulation is described are
citations or mention of reviews and papers on Kinesin-14’s role in regulating microtubule
nucleation at <U+03B3>-TuRC [PMID: 25348260] including identification of a targeting and catalytic
domain [PMID: 23388459] and reviewed here [PMID: 28668932]. Thus in addition to spatial and
temporal control there is the added integration with motor proteins that share an intimate
relationship with most all aspects of microtubules and their complexes and cargos.
7. In the section describing insight into activation from yeast studies, in addition to structural
similarities the cross-species studies on <U+03B3>-tubulin [PMID: 8089179] and on GCP2/GCP3 and
Spc97/Spc98 proteins in fission yeast replacing Alp4/Alp6 [PMID: 23886939] provide even
stronger functional validation. This work should be mentioned and the references should be
cited.
8. Not mentioned are some interesting variations with <U+03B3>-tubulin. For example, that two <U+03B3>-
tubulin isotypes that exist in some eukaryotes, including in Drosophila [PMDI: 11713868], which
may indicate further tweaks to <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes; demonstration in yeast that the absence of
<U+03B3>-tubulin does not block cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation [PMID: 8557744], and the
interesting structural differences of budding yeast <U+03B3>-tubulin Tub4p [8707828] that does not
cross-species substitute functionally and yet it has been quite a useful model in understanding <U+03B3>-
TuSC and <U+03B3>-TuRC structurally and functionally. A mention of these points will benefit the
reader in understanding additional complexities.
9. In the figures, the N- and C- terminal domain orientations in <U+03B3>-TuSC should be indicated in
figures to aid the reader.

eins citing work from diverse eukaryotic model systems on the assembly and regulation of <U+03B3>-tubulin
plexes. The historical balance of work from multiple organisms is generally sufficiently presented but
ses much of the excitement of the early years in which <U+03B3>-tubulin, spc97/Alp4, Spc98/Alp6 studies in
ding and fission yeasts dominated the field and aided identification of similar proteins from human,
sophila and other eukaryotes. The iterative and explorative nature of studies in multiple eukaryotic
ems indeed has propelled the field, particularly the identification of conserved functional domains,
ctural information, biochemistry of complexes and cross-species functional studies. This interplay has
n critical to advance the field and should be directly stated.”

The stoichiometry of the <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes has been largely defined biochemically by multiple
ies, a point which should be mentioned and references cited.”

The in vitro nucleation differences between <U+03B3>-TuSC and <U+03B3>-TuRC and associated proteins were also
d by earlier studies in budding yeast [PMID: 11950928]. The authors both state that <U+03B3>-TuSC nucleates
rly and that it doesn’t nucleate at all (top of page 4), the latter should be removed.”

are aware of the studies mentioned by reviewer 2. We chose not to discuss these, since they
onstrate a very specific role of kinesin 14 in the disassembly of the gamma-TuRC, but they don’t
rm about gamma-TuRC assembly and activation, which is the focus of our review. Moreover, these
ies are mainly based on work by one research group, and their significance has never been
firmed by others.

Not mentioned are some interesting variations with <U+03B3>-tubulin. For example, that two <U+03B3>-tubulin
ypes that exist in some eukaryotes, including in Drosophila [PMDI: 11713868], which may indicate
her tweaks to <U+03B3>-tubulin complexes; demonstration in yeast that the absence of <U+03B3>-tubulin does not

ding yeast <U+03B3>-tubulin Tub4p [8707828] that does not cross-species substitute functionally and yet it has
n quite a useful model in understanding <U+03B3>-TuSC and <U+03B3>-TuRC structurally and functionally. A mention
