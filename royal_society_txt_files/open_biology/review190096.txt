The authors chose a heroic topic “biology complexity” as the center discussion for this mini-
review: intrinsic disordered region, moonlighting enzyme and non-coding RNA. The ambition of
the authors are respectable. However, each topic has been the center of investigation of hundreds
of laboratories in the world. For each topics, there has been decades of studies with the recent
emerge of new findings that has shifted the paradigm. Thus, it is impossible to conduct an in-
depth review on these hot topics in a short mini-review. This article glossed on the surface of
these three important and sophisticated topics but didn’t have a chance to provide the insight the
reader would appreciate. The references in the review is mostly outdated and the figures
provided are not particular original. Instead of a pan-spectrum of many mechanisms that
accounts for biological complexity (which is easily a title for a multi-volume book), maybe a
better strategy is to focus on one of the topics, read through the recent key findings and write a
review on that.

Dear Dr Grzybowska,
We are writing to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0236 entitled "RNA-protein
interactions: disorder, moonlighting and junk contribute to eukaryotic complexity" has, in its
current form, been rejected for publication in Open Biology.
The referees have recommended that major revisions are necessary but that the manuscript has
potential; hence, we would like to actively encourage you to revise the manuscript accordingly,
and resubmit. Nevertheless, please note that this is not a provisional acceptance.
The resubmission will be treated as a new manuscript and will re-enter the review process.
Every attempt will be made to use the original referees, but this cannot be guaranteed. Please
note that resubmissions must be submitted within six months of the date of this email. In
exceptional circumstances, extensions may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office.
Manuscripts submitted after this date will be automatically rejected.
Please find below the comments made by the referees, not including confidential reports to the
Editor, which I hope you will find useful. If you do choose to resubmit your manuscript, please
upload a ‘response to referees’ document including details of how you have responded to the
comments, and the adjustments you have made.
To upload a resubmitted manuscript, log into http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter
your Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Resubmission." Please be sure to indicate in your
cover letter that it is a resubmission, and supply the previous reference number.

label_comment_4
In this review Balcerak and coworkers have tried to highlight the different types of RNA-protein
interactions and their importance. The paper discusses about the RNA-binding proteins, that are
ordered, disordered and also about the RNA motifs that interact with these proteins. Though it is
great to have that overall picture, it is difficult to get any detailed information when so many
topics are addressed at once. In some sections there appears to be a lot of repetition of the same
concept for example in the section 2.2, the intrinsically disordered proteins have been described
multiple times. In other sections there is a lack of conclusive information.
I would suggest that the authors focus on one subtopic and go into the details of the findings as
well as the methods that have been employed in the field, as that would convey more useful
information to the readers.

Authors' response:
Referee 1:
While we generally agree that the review in it's previous form could be perceived as
superficial, we would like to point out that the main goal was not to comprehensively describe
all of the aspects of biological complexity, but to focus on RNA-protein interactions and to
describe how they contribute to complexity and on what levels. In the revised version we tried
o articulate this merit more clearly. We addressed two key issues that pertain to this topic: the
lexibility of RNA-protein interactions caused by structural disorder in RBPs and the
variability provided by RBPs binding to non-coding RNAs. Metabolic enzymes moonlighting
s treated just as a special, binary case of structural switch, providing less flexibility than
DPs, but important for the crosstalk between cellular metabolism and the regulation of RNA.
As such, we think that it cannot be omitted.
n the first version of the review these issues were joined mechanistically, without logical
low of narration and the topic of non-coding RNA was described without strict adherence to
he main subject, with excessive digressions, which indeed could give an impression of
glossing on the surface of every potential mechanism, without an insight.
n the revised version we provide more organized narration, pondering on previously
unreported observation that while the amount of non-coding RNA is dramatically higher in
more complex organisms, the number of RBPs in eukaryotes is relatively stable. This implies
hat the flexibility of RBPs, brought about by intrinsic disorder is crucial in managing high
numbers of RNA species in eukaryotes. This observation links together the two main sources
of complexity described in our review: RBPs multi-functionality and diverse functions of
non-coding RNAs.
Moreover, we added a paragraph addressing the question how the plasticity and variability of
RNA-protein interactions may translate into complex regulatory networks.
Additionally, we updated some of the references and modified figures, adding an original plot
Figure 2).
We feel that the revised version has been improved substantially, gained additional depth and
hat the corrections address this referee's comments.
Referee 2:
We included all the referee's comments, except in places where the text has been changed.
Appendix B
Authors' response:
Referee: 2
All minor changes suggested by this referee were made.
Referee: 3
Section 2.2 was carefully edited to eliminate unnecessary repetitions, however we would like
o point out that what can be perceived as repetitions of the concept at the fist glance,
epresents in fact different aspects of disordered RBPs features (physicochemical properties,
nduced folding phenomenon, evolutionarily conservation). To facilitate the perception of this
part we have added subtitles to this section.
A sentence listing various methods used in high-throughput analyses of RNA-RBP
nteractions was added along with the appropriate references. However, since these methods
were comprehensively described elsewhere and this review focuses on molecular mechanisms,
not methods, more detailed description was omitted, since it would be introducing yet another
opic, not in line with the whole narrative.
On that note, it is our conviction that reducing our review to only one subtopic (for example
disorder in RBPs) will make it trivial and without the dimension build around the observation
hat the flexibility of RBPs, brought about by intrinsic disorder is crucial in managing high
numbers of RNA species in eukaryotes.
