This is a fine manuscript that reports important new findings about the regulation of splicing
fidelity in the increasingly important model system Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It reports the
identification of two splicing factors that, when mutated, act to suppress mutations affecting both
the 5' donor and 3' acceptor sites for pre-mRNA splicing. A less surprising, but still useful,
observation is that nonsense mediated RNA decay operates in Chlamydomonas and can be
altered by mutation of the SMG1 gene.
There are small issues with the paper but nothing that precludes publication or should require
additional experiments. In particular the odd observation that the ts fla9 mutated spontaneously
changed to a non-conditional flagella-less phenotype is distracting. The authors argue that this
change is somehow related to a change in trace metals in the medium seems reasonable, but it
should be possible to test this by altering trace metals used. A more serious concern is that the
most important observation of the paper, that the FRA10 gene is involved in splicing fidelity, is
supported by the least amount of data. Only one of two transformants that appeared to restore
splicing fidelity upon transformation of the wild-type FRA10 gene were analyzed at the
molecular level. Given that it is possible to generate a number of such transformants easily it
would be desirable to demonstrate splicing alterations in several independent events. Finally,
given that insertional mutant alleles are available for thousands of Chlamydomonas genes, it
would be useful to know if the authors tested such a mutation for FRA10 to see if it suppressed
the fla9 or ift121-1 defects. The conclusions about DGR14 and FRA10, however, are well-
supported overall.

Identifying RNA splicing factors in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Huawen Lin*, Zhengyan Zhang*, Carlo Iomini†, Susan K. Dutcher*
This manuscript presents an analysis of two mutants of C. reinhardtii carrying alteration of splice
sites in genes encoding proteins required for flagella function and of their suppressors.
The manuscript is well written and experiments were thoroughly conducted. The genetic
evidence for the role of starting mutations and suppressors is very good. This manuscript is
therefore of sufficient scientific quality to be published in Open Biology. Yet, a few points need to
be improved before publication:
1) Introduction of splicing needs to be improved: they are several splicing systems (autocatalytic
introns, canonical nuclear pre-mRNA splicing, AT-AC introns). This should be clarified in the
introduction. The discussion of the different stages of spliceosome assembly (is-there only one
spliceosome?) could be clarified.
2) The manuscript is very long and contains sometime superfluous information. This will make it
poorly accessible for readers outside this area. Authors should make an effort to concentrate on
essential information. This is especially the case in the discussion. E.G., the discussion of pLI
scores is for example totally unnecessary. Similarly, the manuscripts brings little new information
on NMD or intraflagellar transport, the corresponding sections could be shortened.
3) The presentation of DGR14 and FRA10 should be more complete. Why do the authors not
quote result about the S. pombe homolog suggesting that it is a protein of the nuclear envelope
(and thus potentially only indirectly related to splicing)? (See J Biol Chem. (2002) 277:10562-72.)
Additional information on the roles of homologs of these factors in different species and of their
conservation should be presented. (Are homologs always present in organisms with canonical
nuclear splicing?)
4) For supplementary figures, in the multiple alignments “yeast” or “plant” are meaningless.
4
Please indicate the species names for all entries and mention the accession number in the figure
legend.
5) They are few typos. Those should be corrected. (E.G., “random insertion even” for “random
insertion event” page 16.)
6) Authors should be more careful in their comments (e.g., last sentence of abstract “Our study
indicates that Chlamydomonas is an outstanding model system to study RNA splicing and
identify new genes involved in splicing.”). Our understanding of splicing is only slightly
improved as the result of this study. It remains possible that suppressor mutations have an
indirect role, e.g., controlling the concentration of splicing factors in the nucleus through an
action of the nuclear envelope, preventing pre-mRNA export,… Chlamydomonas would be an
outstanding model system to study RNA splicing if in vitro splicing reactions could be carried
out to show that suppressor proteins directly impact splicing and that they truly join the
spliceosome.

Editor's Comments to Author(s):
Your paper has been reviewed by two leading authorities on splicing and both of them found it
to be of interest and were supportive of publication but to different degrees. Reviewer 1 is the
more enthusiastic but raises a number of minor points that can be easily addressed whereas
reviewer 2 is more critical. Having inspected the paper myself I tend to agree with reviewer 2's
comments especially 1 (improve the introduction to make it more accessible to the non-specialist),
2 (remove the superfluous information as indicated) and 3 (reference the S. pombe work).
Addressing these points should not be too onerous and will lead to an improved version.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_4
This manuscript by Lin et al. on the genetic identification of suppressors of RNA splicing defects
in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a revised version of a manuscript submitted earlier.
Compared to the original manuscript, this revised version contains several positive points that
have been improved based on the reviewers’ comments. This include for example:
- An improved presentation of splicing;
- Elimination of superfluous description of pLI scores;
- Citation of the work on homologous proteins from S. pombe;
- Improved figures for supplementary data with references to species…
Yet some weaknesses persist:
- The manuscript remains very long and may be difficult to read for non-specialists;
- Description of the SMG1 analysis and intraflagellar transport was only modestly reduced and
remains far from the main message and distractive;
- While the authors claim that the identified suppressors affect splice site selection, they fail to
analyze deeply and thoroughly this process:
* They do not comment on how this process would be performed in species lacking
homologs of the identified factors although we know that this occurs with great efficiency and
accuracy.
* More importantly, they fail to quote manuscripts having identified the molecular
mechanism of splice site recognitions (even though some of them were recently published in a
highly visible journal, Liu et al. Science. (2017) 358:1278-1283, Wilkinson et al. Science. (2017)
358:1283-1288) ;
- Possibilities for indirect suppressor effects are not clearly discussed;
- Etc.
Overall, while this manuscript present solid results, it is not optimally prepared and does not
carry a focused message with deep interpretation. It is an editorial decision whether this
somewhat superficial version is suitable for publication in Open Biology but it is somewhat
disappointing that not sufficient efforts have been made to extract the real scientific information
obtained in this project.

Appendix A
Dear Editors:
We are submitting a revision of our manuscript entitled "Identifying RNA splicing factors in
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii " to Open Biology (RSOB-17-0211). This manuscript represents our
complete and unpublished results, and is not being considered at any other journal. All of the
authors have read and approved the manuscript. We have no conflicts of interests in the publication
of this work. The authors have no competing financial interests.
The overall goal of this work was to determine the functions of three genes identified by suppressor
analysis function using the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as our model. We
found two genes, DGCR14/DRG14 and FRA10AC1/FRA10, that when mutated can splice at
noncanonical splice sites. We document their role in the IFT121 and IFT81/FLA9 genes. We show in
this revised manuscript that despite a mild phenotype, these genes are well conserved throughout
the eukaryotic lineage with the exception of the fungi. This analysis suggests that organisms with a
high density of introns are likely to have these two genes. We think that this analysis suggests that
Chlamydomonas is an attractive genetic model for studying noncore splicesome proteins in the way
that S. cerevisiae was a model for the core splicesome proteins.
Although proteomics had shown that these two proteins are found in the human spliceosome, we
show that their loss can promote splicing at noncanonical sites. We suggest these two splicing
factors function in splice site recognition; in their absence noncanonical sites are used. We think
these are important observations and provide new knowledge about the splicesome and its
proteins.
In addition, we have included results on the action of a mutation in SMG1, a protein needed for
nonsense mediated decay. We show that that the loss of the key NMD protein, SMG1, stabilizes
aberrant messages. Although this biological process is well documented, this is the first
demonstration of NMD in Chlamydomonas. It also leads to some unique observations about the
intraflagellar transport protein process.
We would ask that the same reviewers be used for the revision as we specifically address their
concerns as documented in comments to the reviewers.

Author's Response:
We have carefully read the comments and our response are below. Our responses are numbered 1-
12.
Referee: 1
This is a fine manuscript that reports important new findings about the regulation of splicing fidelity
in the increasingly important model system Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
1. We thank the reviewers for recognizing the new findings and pointing out their importance.
It reports the identification of two splicing factors that, when mutated, act to suppress mutations
affecting both the 5' donor and 3' acceptor sites for pre-mRNA splicing. A less surprising, but still
useful, observation is that nonsense mediated RNA decay operates in Chlamydomonas and can be
altered by mutation of the SMG1 gene.
2. We agree that the finding of NMD mutations is not new, but it is important to report them for
other Chlamydomonas researchers.
There are small issues with the paper but nothing that precludes publication or should require
additional experiments. In particular the odd observation that the ts fla9 mutated spontaneously
changed to a non-conditional flagella-less phenotype is distracting. The authors argue that this
change is somehow related to a change in trace metals in the medium seems reasonable, but it
should be possible to test this by altering trace metals used.
3. We have moved this information to the materials and methods section. We tried to find the
environmental and/or genetic causes. We failed to identify the cause, but feel it is important to
report this finding to the Chlamydomonas community.
A more serious concern is that the most important observation of the paper, that the FRA10 gene is
involved in splicing fidelity, is supported by the least amount of data. Only one of two transformants
that appeared to restore splicing fidelity upon transformation of the wild-type FRA10 gene were
analyzed at the molecular level. Given that it is possible to generate a number of such transformants
easily it would be desirable to demonstrate splicing alterations in several independent events.
4. We performed two new, independent transformations and we now have 5 independent
transgene rescue strains that were analyzed at the molecular level. We examined the IFT121
mRNAs in all five transgene rescue strains and found restoration of the mutant mRNA as we
expected. We feel confident that FRA10 is the correct gene and that these transgene strains
support this conclusion.
Finally, given that insertional mutant alleles are available for thousands of Chlamydomonas genes, it
would be useful to know if the authors tested such a mutation for FRA10 to see if it suppressed the
fla9 or ift121-1 defects. The conclusions about DGR14 and FRA10, however, are well-supported
overall.
5. There is only one insertional allele in the FRA10 gene in the CLiP collection that Reviewer 1
mentions. The insertion is in an intron and has low confidence of the Jonikas group. Given our
experience with over 75 insertional mutants from the collection, a confidence value of 58%
suggests that it is unlikely to be real. About 30% of the insertions are not found in the position
listed in the databases. Since we now have 5 independent transgene rescue strains, we feel
confident that FRA10 is the correct gene.
Referee: 2
This manuscript presents an analysis of two mutants of C. reinhardtii carrying alteration of splice
sites in genes encoding proteins required for flagella function and of their suppressors.
The manuscript is well written and experiments were thoroughly conducted. The genetic evidence
for the role of starting mutations and suppressors is very good.
6. We thank Reviewer 2 for these comments.
This manuscript is therefore of sufficient scientific quality to be published in Open Biology. Yet, a few
points need to be improved before publication:
Introduction of splicing needs to be improved: there are several splicing systems (autocatalytic
introns, canonical nuclear pre-mRNA splicing, AT-AC introns). This should be clarified in the
introduction. The discussion of the different stages of spliceosome assembly (is there only one
spliceosome?) could be clarified.
7. We have revised the introduction significantly to reflect the needed background on splicing.
The manuscript is very long and contains sometime superfluous information. This will make it poorly
accessible for readers outside this area. Authors should make an effort to concentrate on essential
information. This is especially the case in the discussion. E.G., the discussion of pLI scores is for
example totally unnecessary. Similarly, the manuscript brings little new information on NMD or
intraflagellar transport, the corresponding sections could be shortened.
8. We shortened the manuscript. However, we have not removed the discussion about IFT as we
think the findings are of interest to the IFT community.
The presentation of DGR14 and FRA10 should be more complete. Why do the authors not quote
result about the S. pombe homolog suggesting that it is a protein of the nuclear envelope (and thus
potentially only indirectly related to splicing)? (See J Biol Chem. (2002) 277:10562-72.) Additional
information on the roles of homologs of these factors in different species and of their conservation
should be presented. (Are homologs always present in organisms with canonical nuclear splicing?).
9. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the S. pombe DGCR14 work. We have expanded the
examination of the phylogenetic distribution of DRG14 and FRA10 with respect to intron density.
It is included in the discussion and shown in Figure 6.
For supplementary figures, in the multiple alignments “yeast” or “plant” are meaningless. Please
indicate the species names for all entries and mention the accession number in the figure legend.
10. We appreciate this comment and have changed the supplemental figures accordingly.
There are a few typos. Those should be corrected. (E.G., “random insertion even” for “random
insertion event” page 16.)
11. These have been corrected. Spell check can often introduce errors.
Authors should be more careful in their comments (e.g., last sentence of abstract “Our study
indicates that Chlamydomonas is an outstanding model system to study RNA splicing and identify
new genes involved in splicing.”). Our understanding of splicing is only slightly improved as the result
of this study. It remains possible that suppressor mutations have an indirect role, e.g., controlling
the concentration of splicing factors in the nucleus through an action of the nuclear envelope,
preventing pre-mRNA export,… Chlamydomonas would be an outstanding model system to study
RNA splicing if in vitro splicing reactions could be carried out to show that suppressor proteins
directly impact splicing and that they truly join the spliceosome.
12. We have modified the comments in Abstract and Introduction. We agree with the reviewer
that the two factors we identified may have indirect roles in RNA splicing. They have minor effects
but they are important enough to be conserved through evolution in the eukaryotic kingdom.
Nevertheless, Chlamydomonas, especially our ift mutants, offers an easy system to identify
additional players involved in RNA splicing.

s manuscript by Lin et al. on the genetic identification of suppressors of RNA splicing defects
hlamydomonas reinhardtii is a revised version of a manuscript submitted earlier.
mpared to the original manuscript, this revised version contains several positive points that
e been improved based on the reviewers’ comments. This include for example:
n improved presentation of splicing;
imination of superfluous description of pLI scores;
tation of the work on homologous proteins from S. pombe;
proved figures for supplementary data with references to species…
some weaknesses persist:
he manuscript remains very long and may be difficult to read for non-specialists;
escription of the SMG1 analysis and intraflagellar transport was only modestly reduced and
ains far from the main message and distractive;
We understand that the smg mutants may appear distracting to the splicing community,
it is a key result for the Chlamydomonas and IFT communities. We have shortened it, but
think it is very important to include these results. Chlamydomonas researchers are
prised by the results and it is important to make them available to the community.
hile the authors claim that the identified suppressors affect splice site selection, they fail to
lyze deeply and thoroughly this process:
* They do not comment on how this process would be performed in species lacking
mologs of the identified factors although we know that this occurs with great efficiency and
uracy.
We present a phylogenetic assessment of the presence of DGR14 and FRA10. They are
erally missing in organisms with a low intron density. We think that these genes are likely
e needed as intron density increases.
* More importantly, they fail to quote manuscripts having identified the molecular
chanism of splice site recognitions (even though some of them were recently published in a
hly visible journal, Liu et al. Science. (2017) 358:1278-1283, Wilkinson et al. Science. (2017)
:1283-1288)
We thank the referee for pointing out the new papers that came out 12 days before we
ubmitted our manuscript. We have included these references as well as the newer results on
human catalytic step 1 splicesome that was published 6 days ago (Zhan et al., Science,
8). We have incorportated a short description of these new findings.
ssibilities for indirect suppressor effects are not clearly discussed;
rall, while this manuscript present solid results, it is not optimally prepared and does not
ry a focused message with deep interpretation. It is an editorial decision whether this
ewhat superficial version is suitable for publication in Open Biology but it is somewhat
ppointing that not sufficient efforts have been made to extract the real scientific information
ained in this project.
We have trimmed the number of words by ~1000 to try to make it “tighter”. We
reciate these comments, but we are a flagellar/cilia lab. We hope that these results will be
ful to the community that investigates the molecular basis of splice site selection.
