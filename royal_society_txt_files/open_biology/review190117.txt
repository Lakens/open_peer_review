Suramin is an interesting compound that acts as a DNA or RNA mimic and it is turning our that
suramin can be used to block several DNA protein interactions. What I like about this paper is
that they do careful characterizations of he suramin/analogs interactions with the target. The
anticancer activities is a bit weak but that could be because of permeation issues. In any case I
recommend acceptance.

This is an interesting paper. DNA-binding proteins are considered "difficult" targets for drug
discovery, so the success reported here in the identification of hits against mcm10 (albeit with a
low hit rate) will be of wide interest to readers interested in such (potential) drug targets. The
selectivity compounds identified were checked by comparison with replication protein A. The
assays appear to be robust. Appropriate controls are used. The discussion is informative.
Minor comments:
-A sentence in the abstract about the function of mcm10 would assist readers unfamiliar with this
protein.
-In paragraph 2 of the introduction, the rationale for the choice of the mcm10 ID domain for
screening is given, but it is not clear why the NTD was excluded.
-It would be useful for readers unfamiliar with the cell lines to state why HCT116 and hTERT-
RPE1 cells were selected for cell assays.
-the abbreviation PPADS should be defined on first use in the text (p9). Did the authors mean to
say "Interestingly, iso-PPADS and PPADS _failed to_inhibit probe binding to xMcm10-FL by >
50% up to a concentration of 2 mM"?
-From which species is the RPA used to assess inhibitor specificity?
-Supplementary figures should be cited consistently (compare "Supplementary Fig. S1" vs
"Supplementary Fig. 5").
-The strange shapes of the inhibition curves in Figures S3b and S5 deserves comment. My guess is
that the compounds are starting to precipitate at higher concentrations.

This is a concise manuscript that tells a very interesting story of an unrewarding drug screening
campaign that will be a useful reference for other workers who try to find inhibitors of protein-
DNA interactions. The work is well done, the approach is well described and the results present
an instructional narrative of interest to a broad readership. The authors describe the setup of a
fluorescence polarization high-throughput screening (FP-HTS) assay for inhibitors of binding of
the key DNA replication protein MCM10 to DNA. Human MCM10 is established as a potential
anticancer target.
The FP-HTS and immediate follow up assays identified only the polysulfated polyaromatic urea
compound suramin as being worthwhile of being pursued. The authors then followed up with
high-quality affinity (FP and SPR) and cell-based assays to examine a range of suramin analogs.
The conclusion is that suramin and its relatives act as as DNA analogs to compete with the DNA-
binding site in MCM10.
Suramin has turned up again and again as an inhibitor of many enzymes over the past 80 years or
so, many of which are not known to interact with DNA (e.g. jack bean urease!). So although it is
used clinically, its mechanisms and targets are not rigorously known. The authors could briefly
review some of this fascinating literature to increase the general interest of their study.
There are a few typos and confusing sentences in the manuscript and more in the SI. I encourage
the authors to read the m/s and SI carefully and make appropriate corrections before submission
of a revised version..

r. Glover,
Thank you for the positive decision letter from July 4, 2019. We have enclosed a revised version
manuscript entitled “The anti-parasitic agent suramin and several of its analogs are inhibitors of
A binding protein Mcm10”. I am submitting the paper on behalf of all authors: Carolyn N. Paulson,
John, Ryan M. Baxley, Fredy Kurniawan, Kayo Orellana, Rawle Francis, Alexandra Sobeck,
F. Eichman, Walter J. Chazin, Hideki Aihara, Gunda I. Georg, Jon E. Hawkinson, and Anja-
Bielinsky. Dr. Hawkinson and I are co-corresponding authors on this manuscript.
We have amended our manuscript in response to the reviewers’ suggestions. Here, I briefly
arize the changes we have made:
1) We have added a sentence in the abstract to better describe that Mcm10 is essential for
DNA unwinding by the replisome.
2) We have added a sentence to the 2nd paragraph (page 4) of the introduction to point out that
the N-terminal domain of Mcm10 does not have any DNA binding activity.
3) We have included a rationale on page 11 for selecting the specific cell lines we utilized to
test cytotoxic activity. Both are of epithelial origin.
4) We included the full name of PPADS, and revised a sentence on page 9 that was unclear.
It now reads: “Interestingly, iso-pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2', 4'-disulfonic acid (iso-
PPADS) and PPADS inhibited probe binding to xMcm10-FL by less than 50% when added
up to a concentration of 2 mM (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3B).”
5) We make clear that human RPA was utilized.
6) We consistently cite Supplementary Figures as “Supplementary Figure S” followed by a
number.
7) We have added to the figure legends for Supplementary Figures S3 and S5 and explanation
for the “strange” shape of the inhibition curves. It reads: “The tailing up of the dose-response
curves for both compounds at concentrations of 1 mM could be due to lack of solubility, a
detergent-like effect of these amphipathic molecules, or fluorescence interference.”
8) We have also added a little bit more information on suramin as suggested by reviewer 3. We
included recent findings of the beneficial effects of low-dose suramin in the treatment of
autism-like disorders (references 37-39 on page 12).
9) We have corrected typos and revised wording for clarity in both the main manuscript and the
supplementary information.
On behalf of all authors, I’d like to thank you very much for serving as our editor, and soliciting
nstructive reviews. We believe that the review process has further strengthened our manuscript.
