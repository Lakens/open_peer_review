Dear Dr Ikeda
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-19-0010 entitled "Functional
ectodermal organ regeneration as the next generation of organ replacement therapy" has been
accepted by the Editor for publication in Open Biology. The reviewer(s) have recommended
publication, but also suggest some minor revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you
to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments and revise your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.

Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
The Open Biology Team

Appendix A
Referee's Comments to Author(s):
This has dramatically improved. I have just few comments concerning the text in the
attached file.
This manuscript has greatly improved and for most part reads well. The only critique
concerns the Abstract, and part 6 as well as the organoid issue. The difference
between organoids, miniorgans, and functional organs should be clarified in the text
(and tell that the organoids are usually composed of one tissue type, i.e. epithelium,
and because stromal tissue is lacking, organoids cannot form functional organs). This
issue should be covered already in the Introduction - it is mentioned there but should
be expanded by moving the organoid issue from Part 6 (shortened) to Introduction.
Also the Abstract should be rephrased: It gives
the impression that organoids could be used for bioengineering functional organs.
lines 5-8 should be either removed or shortened.
Part 6 is partially quite unclear, and most of the content can be shortened and moved
to Introduction. Part 6 could focus only on the cellular source of the stem cells for
bioengineering organs: How to replace the organ-specific mouse embryonic cells?
Here describe authors´ “salivary gland from ES cells” experiments.
page 6, the title 2) Lachrymal- should read: lacrimal
Our Response: We have studied your comments carefully and found that you
understood the value and significance of our study in this field. We are grateful for
your evaluation and valuable suggestions for our manuscript. The potential
application of regenerative medicine in the clinical setting is supported by the recent
development of organ regeneration technique that mimic embryonic patterning and
positioning signals, and thereby recapitulate the conditions required to facilitate
organ self-organization during embryonic organogenesis. Follow the instructions of
the referee, we have clarified the difference between organoids as miniorgans and
functional organs. We described that recent studies have reported the induction of an
organ-forming-field types, and the subsequent generation of a range of organoids (i.e.
‘mini-organs’) of limited size, that partially recapitulate the organ function in vivo
upon transplantation. Furthermore, we described about the studies that demonstrated
the successful regeneration of a salivary gland, which were shown to be fully
functional upon transplantation in a murine model. We have shortened Part6 and
moves Introduction.
We have change Lachrymal to lacrimal on page 6.
