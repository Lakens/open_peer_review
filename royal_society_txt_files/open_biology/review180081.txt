There have been some conceptual articles drawing parallel between placenta and some
pathological conditions, especially cancer, in the past. This manuscript provides an original and
inspiring new insight in this area and it would no doubt trigger a discussion in the field and
stimulate new lines of investigation. I rarely recommend to accept manuscripts in their submitted
form, but in this case, I suggest to publish this work without any modifications.

In the present manuscript, Vincenzo Costanzo and colleagues elaborate on the concept that
cancer (particularly metastatic, solid disease) has strong similarities to placentation. This is, to my
knowledge, a very novel concept and the evidence presented is substantial enough to be
convincing (they clearly have convinced me!). Most of the questions that I had while reviewing
this work were addressed al later parts, and overall, I believe that this contribution is rather
round. Thus, I can only make a few suggestions that hope can slightly contribute to this work.
#1 Is it known whether the cGAS/STING contributes to placentation? Perhaps it would be
interesting to explore whether STING agonists or NF-KB activation also enable the generation of
trophoblast cells from reprogrammed iPS or mESC cultures.
#2 It could be worthwhile to mention the published works on how BRCA deficiency leads to the
expression of repeated sequences in the genome, as further evidence of a connection between
genomic instability/RS and the expression of the "dark genome".
#3 While DUX4 mutations have been found in cancer, I would not say that they occur "often".
The point is taken, but perhaps the authors could mention that there might exist other mutations,
besides those in DUX, that favor totipotency in tumors?
#4 From the list of genes that are essential in mammals, and that have a clear function in the
placenta, are there many druggable targets? It is somewhat natural to speculate from this reading
that such genes might be interesting "anti-metastatic" targets?
#5 Along the same lines, from the many studies that have reported genes with a pro-metastatic
function, is there a bias towards genes expressed in the placenta?
#6 One of the statements made is that polyploidy facilitates resistance to DNA damage. Not sure
I fully agree here. Polyploidy (ergo, more DNA damage) can also sensitize cells to DNA
damaging agents. I believe that the contrary sentence might be truer though, namely that
resistance to DNA damage favours polyploidy.
#7 Are there differences in metastatic solid tumor occurrences, between mammals that use
different placentation developmental pathways?
#8 There is a small error in page 12: "...linked to linked to..".
In summary, I have truly enjoyed reading this piece. While provocative, it provides enough
orthogonal evidence as to make a convincing case.

estigation. I rarely recommend to accept manuscripts in their submitted form,

d that our review has been evaluated as useful contribution to the field.

mments to the Author(s)
the present manuscript, Vincenzo Costanzo and colleagues elaborate on the
ncept that cancer (particularly metastatic, solid disease) has strong similarities
placentation. This is, to my knowledge, a very novel concept and the evidence
sented is substantial enough to be convincing (they clearly have convinced
!). Most of the questions that I had while reviewing this work were addressed
later parts, and overall, I believe that this contribution is rather round. Thus, I
n only make a few suggestions that hope can slightly contribute to this work.
r response: We thank this reviewer for the positive and constructive
mments. We have now addressed all the point raised as detailed below. These
mments have contributed to make our manuscript even stronger.
Is it known whether the cGAS/STING contributes to placentation? Perhaps it
uld be interesting to explore whether STING agonists or NF-KB activation
o enable the generation of trophoblast cells from reprogrammed iPS or
SC cultures.
r response: It is currently not known whether cGAS/STING contributes to
centation. However, it is intriguing that STING is highly expressed in placenta
ls. We have now included this information and the relative reference on page
. As far as the stimulation of the STING pathway in mESC cells is concerned
are currently working on this topic, which will be the subject of a future
nuscript.
It could be worthwhile to mention the published works on how BRCA
ficiency leads to the expression of repeated sequences in the genome, as
ther evidence of a connection between genomic instability/RS and the
pression of the "dark genome".
r response: We have now cited and discussed this interesting observation
page 13 as suggested.
While DUX4 mutations have been found in cancer, I would not say that they
cur "often". The point is taken, but perhaps the authors could mention that
re might exist other mutations, besides those in DUX, that favor totipotency in
mors?
r response: On page 15 we have modified the statement about DUX, which is
metime (and not often) found mutated in tumors, as correctly pointed out by the
eree. We have also listed other genes controlling totitpotency that are found
tated in tumors, including TET 1/2/3 and HDACs enzymes.
From the list of genes that are essential in mammals, and that have a clear
ction in the placenta, are there many druggable targets? It is somewhat
tural to speculate from this reading that such genes might be interesting "anti-
tastatic" targets?
r response: This is an important and well taken point. We have now mentioned
genes PLAC1 and Syncytins, which are placenta specific genes that are re-
pressed in cancer cells. These genes are being considered as putative targets
cancer therapy, as reported in the work cited on Page 18.
Along the same lines, from the many studies that have reported genes with a
-metastatic function, is there a bias towards genes expressed in the placenta?
r response: This is another interesting point, which we have stressed in the
nuscript. On page 10 we have now mentioned that pro-metastatic genes a7b1,
F-beta VEGF and HIF1 alpha are highly expressed in placenta cells as
orted by the reports now cited in the manuscript.
One of the statements made is that polyploidy facilitates resistance to DNA
mage. Not sure I fully agree here. Polyploidy (ergo, more DNA damage) can
o sensitize cells to DNA damaging agents. I believe that the contrary
ntence might be truer though, namely that resistance to DNA damage favours
lyploidy.
r response: We agree with this referee that polyploidy can sensitize cells to
A damage and might itself form in response to DNA damage, as we now
cuss on page 11.
Are there differences in metastatic solid tumor occurrences, between
mmals that use different placentation developmental pathways?
r response: We have now discussed the different types of placentation and
possibility that metastasis correlates to these ones. We have mentioned
rsupials as a main example, which get tumors although they lack invasive
centation. We have also discussed the possibility that there might not be a
ect correlation between invasive placenta and metastasis due to complex
olutionary relations known as pleiotropy. In this case the organisms might have
t invasive placentation by evolving mechanisms to limit invasiveness of
centa, making difficult a direct correlation between metastasis and placenta
mation. This discussion can be found on page 17.
There is a small error in page 12: "...linked to linked to..".
r response: Thank you for spotting this mistake, which has been fixed.
summary, I have truly enjoyed reading this piece. While provocative, it
vides enough orthogonal evidence as to make a convincing case.
