In this study, the authors show that the SepB domain of human Ctf4 homologue, AND-1, exists in
a trimeric form, and binds to Pol a/primase, like yeast Ctf4. The authors also found that the
principal Pol a-binding region of AND-1 is its C-terminal HMG box, although the AND-1 SepB
domain has still retained a weak affinity for the CIP sequence of human Pol a. The HMG box
specifically contacts with the N-terminal domain of B subunit of Pol a. A novel DNA-binding
activity in AND-1 is also mapped to the intervening region between the SepB domain and the
HMG box, suggesting its role in guiding the lagging-strand template towards Pol a/primase.
These findings are new, and may be important for understanding the evolutional development of
the replisome among eukaryotes.
Data are solid, and experiments are properly done. Conclusion depicted by the authors is based
on the reliable experimental data. Therefore, I recommend that this paper can be published in
Open Biology, with minor modifications, as listed below.

amino acids between the C-terminus of the SepB domain and the HMG box domain (Figure 8B,

Figure 1B: Please indicate bands corresponding to B, B deltaN, PriS, and PriL on CBB
stained gel. I wonder what is the third band from the bottom only observed in Polalpha-B-
PriS-PriL complex, and where is the B deltaN band.
We have labelled the bands in the Coomassie stained gel, as requested. The third band
from the bottom in the Pol alpha-B-PriS-PriL lane is the B subunit. In the lane for the Pol
alpha- B<U+F044>N-PriS-PriL sample, B<U+F044>N runs below the PriS band, faster than expected for its size.
We have noticed consistently that B<U+F044>N runs as a fuzzy, smeary band in SDS-PAGE.
Figure 1A: Please indicate the number of amino acids on the cartoons.
This has been done in the revised figure.
Figure 2: I recommend to use colors for protomers with more clear difference. It is difficult to
define protomers in the current color code.
We have changed the color scheme in Figure 2A, to make it easier to distinguish the
protomers in the AND-1 trimer.
Figure 3: Please put protein names on the left side of the gel.
This has been done in the revised manuscript. We have added the names on the right-hand
side of the gel, for ease of reading.
Figure 6B: Labels for marker sizes are slipped.
This has been fixed in the revised manuscript.
Figures 7 and 8: The authors described that "We further found that AND-1CT was the region
of AND-1 responsible for DNA binding (Figure 7B)." and "unexpectedly, the HMG box was
not involved in DNA binding and that the DNA-binding activity resided within a stretch of
~100 amino acids between the C-terminus of the SepB domain and the HMG box domain
(Figure 8B, C)." This is controversial to the previous report (Guan C. et al., J. Biol. Chem.,
2017). Appropriate explanation for this discrepancy should be discussed.
The discrepancy between our data and those of Guan et al. is mentioned in the Discussion.
Under conditions of a large stoichiometric excess of AND-1 1017-1076 (HMG domain), we
can detect weak binding to ssDNA. We tested different DNA substrates, such as a Holliday
junction DNA, but we still couldn’t detect significant binding. So, although we agree with
Guan et al. that the AND-1 CT binds DNA, at present we are unable to reconcile which
portion of the AND-1 CT is responsible for the DNA-binding activity. We trust that we will be
able to resolve this discrepancy with future functional and structural studies.
Figure S3: The number of the vertical axis may not support M766A.
We have prepared a revised version of Figure S3, where the chromatographic traces of the
WT and M766A proteins are on the same, correct position relative to the Y axis.
There are several typos and mistakes (i.e. P.7: ….subunit showed the that…). Please
correct them.
We thank the reviewer for pointing out the typo. We trust that have removed all remaining
typos from the manuscript.
Referee 2
Kilkenny et al present a biochemical/structural study of the human Ctf4-orthologue AND-1
interactions with the CIP motif of Pola and its B subunit. They define interactions between
AND-1’s HMG and the B subunit and between AND-1’s SepB domain and the CIP motif of
Pola. They also show that a ~100 amino acid region between the C-terminus of the SepB
domain and the HMG box in AND-1 binds to DNA with a somewhat higher affinity for ss and
forked DNA compared to dsDNA substrates. They then speculate that this AND-1 DNA-
binding activity might be relevant for directing the lagging strand emerging from the back of
the forward moving replicative ring helicase towards Pola to optimally position it for Okazaki
fragment synthesis. This AND-1/Pola-primase interaction is different than the yeast Ctf4
which also bridges the replicative helicase with the DNA polymerase within the replisome but
does not possess an HMG box. This suggests subtle structural/functional differences
between the yeast and human replisomes although the precise significance of this is not
clear at the moment. Overall, this study presents a novel finding, worthy of publication. My
comments below will clarify and improve the manuscript.
1. Introduction; Lines 67-68. Give precise % identity/similarity between yeast Ctf4 and
human AND-1.
We have added the percentage identity and similarity values, as requested by the reviewer.
2. Introduction; line 72. Specify clearly that the missing C-terminal region from yeast Ctf4 but
present in the human AND-1 contains an HMG box.
We added mention of the HMG box in the AND-1 sequence, as requested by the reviewer.
3. Results; Pages 96-98 and Figure 1. The data presented in Fig. 1 are consistent with an
interaction of AND-1 with the Pola/B, which is analogous to the yeast Ctf4-Pol1 interactions,
but they do not strictly prove that this interaction is mediated by the N-terminal regions of
Pola and its B subunit. The pull down experiments have been done with only with
Pola<U+0394>NB<U+0394>N-PriS-PriL and not with other combinations e.g. Pola<U+0394>N-B-PriS-PriL or Pola-
B<U+0394>N-PriS-PriLin order to verify that both N-terminal domains are involved in the interaction.
Although this is shown further down the paper with other experiments at this stage the
conclusion is that this interaction may be mediated either by both N-terminal domains of
Pola and B or by either C-terminal domain of Pola and B. They should have done pull down
experiments with the other two combinations (suggested above) in order to show that both
domains are involved.
The pulldown experiments of Figure 1 show that AND-1 binding is mediated by the N-
terminal regions of the Pol alpha catalytic subunit and the B subunit. As the reviewer
correctly points out, we could have prepared versions of Pol alpha/primase that had been N-
terminally truncated in either Pol alpha or the B subunit, to verify whether both N-terminal
regions where involved in the interaction. Although this would have been perhaps the most
straightforward approach to identifying a role for the B subunit in binding AND-1, we followed
an experimentally different path that led us to the same conclusion. As the reviewer also
points out, the following experiments described in the paper clearly show that the B subunit
interacts independently with AND-1 and that this is the predominant interaction.
4. Results; Lines 107-110. The authors refer to low sequence similarity between the SepB
structure and the Ctf4CTD but still their remarkable structural resemblance. This is
somewhat confusing for the reader who might get the impression from the introduction (see
point 1 above) that AND-1 and Ctf4 are highly homologous. Therefore, it is important to
specify here clearly that the low sequence similarity refers to residues 329-826 of human
AND-1 and the Ctf4CTD giving the actual % identity/similarity and comparing this to the %
identity/similarity for the rest of the two proteins.
We have added the requested information on line 107 of the revised manuscript.
5. Results; Line 120 and Figure 2A and C. panels A and C in Figure 2 should be combined
into one panel also showing in a distinct different colour the location of the Pola-interacting
hydrophobic patch of AND-1 within the overall trimeric structure of the human AND-1 SepB
domains.
We would prefer to keep panels A and C separate, as in the original figure. To assist the
reader, we have now marked with an arrow the location of the Pol <U+F061>-interacting patch of
AND-1 in panel 2A.
6. Results; Lines 133-135. The reference to Supplementary Figure S2 within this sentence is
misleading and confusing for the reader. The reader expects to see the M766 residue within
the putative Pola CIP-binding site in AND-1 and instead Supplementary Figure S2 shows a
comparison of the Pola CIP sequences from different species. Reference to Supplementary
Figure S2 should be moved to the previous sentence where they are actually discussion the
Pola CIP sequence and reference to Supplementary Figure S3 (which is missing from the
text in the manuscript) should be made instead in this sentence.
We apologise for the typo, which we have now corrected. We now refer to Supplementary
Figure S3, instead of Figure S2, in line 134.
7. Results; Lines 156-159; What’s the meaning of “qualitatively similar”? Curiously, from the
gel shown in Figure 4A that the smallest fragment (MBP-AND-1(1017-1076) is somewhat
more effective at pulling down more GST-B(1-78) than the rest. It appears that the largest
MBP-AND-1(107-1129) has pulled down the least GST-B(1-78). Any idea why? Was this
experiment done only once? Since the pull down assay is well set up, perhaps concentration
titration experiments of GST-B(1-78) for each MBP-AND-1 fragment might reveal better
subtle affinity differences.
We refer to the result of the pulldown experiments of Figure 4 as qualitative, as these
experiments don’t lend themselves easily to accurate quantification, which we didn’t perform.
To avoid possible confusion in the reader, we have removed the word ‘qualitatively’ from the
sentence.
We agree with the reviewer that the 1017-1076 AND-1 fragment pulls down apparently more
GST-B(1-78) than longer AND-1 constructs. We believe that the observed differences don’t
reflect true differences in affinity between constructs, which might indeed exist, but simply
slightly varying levels of bait protein.
The experiments were repeated at least once. Biophysical techniques such as Surface
Plasmon Resonance or Bio-Layer Interferometry would be more appropriate than the
proposed titration pulldown experiments to reveal subtle differences in affinity. However, we
consider that this type of measurements is beyond the scope of the present study.
8. Lines 175-177. The MBP-HMG(A47E) mutant does show less pull down of GST-B(178)
compared to the wt MBP-HMG but reference to Supplementary Figure S5 is confusing as
that figure simply shows purified wt and mutant proteins and no affinity experiments. Again,
they could have done a GST-B(178) concentration titration pull down experiment with wt and
A47E mutant to compare subtle differences in affinities. Was this experiment done only
once?
The point of Supplementary Figure S5 is to show the degree of purity and biochemical
behavior over gel filtration of the wild-type and mutant proteins, to demonstrate their
suitability for biochemical studies. For the proposed titration pulldown experiments, please
see reply to point 7. This experiment was performed twice.
9. Results; Figure 6A and 6C. Were these experiments done only once? As suggested
above, would concentration titration pull down experiments in the case of wt and AND-
1(M1051E) in Fig. 6B and in the case of plus BNT and plus Pola CIP in Fig. 6C be useful to
reveal subtle differences in affinities?
The experiments of Figure 6A and C were performed once. The results are reciprocally
consistent, and therefore the experiments validate each other. For the proposed titration
pulldown experiments, please see reply to point 7.
10. The AND-1/DNA gel shift data in Figure 7A is presented in an unusual manner. These
gel shift experiments need to be done in duplicate/triplicate and then a plot of % binding
versus concentration of AND-1 to be constructed to give comparative Kd values which can
then be compared to the Kd values obtained by fluorescence anisotropy in Figure 8D.
The gel shifts of Figure 7 represent a simple and efficient way to analyse protein-DNA
interactions in a semi-quantitative fashion. We then complemented the gel shift assays with
more accurate, quantitative Kd values obtained by fluorescence anisotropy presented in
Figure 8.
11. Figure 7B. Curiously the gel shift for AND-1(1-1129) is weaker than that of AND-1(837-
1129) which is inconsistent with the data shown in Figure 8E where the full length AND-1
(i.e. 1-1129) appears to bind better to DNA than AND-1(837-1129). There is also a mistake
in the labelling of the blue diamonds within the graph, they have been labelled as AND-1
827-1129 which needs to be corrected to AND-1 836-1129.
We agree with the reviewer that the gel shift of full-length AND-1 appears weaker than that
of the smaller 837-1129 AND-1. It is possible that these differences in DNA-binding affinity
might be caused by differences in the biochemical behaviour of the samples: full-length
AND-1 is a large protein of over 1000 amino acids and might be prone to aggregation under
gel-shift assay conditions. In fact, the fluorescence anisotropy measurements show that the
full-length AND-1 and HMG box domain bind with comparable affinity. We would like to point
out here that the affinity in a FP plot is not determined by the absolute FP value, which is
affected by the size of the protein (ie full-length AND-1 causes a greater FP shift because of
its larger size).
12. Figure 8D. Data in this graph have been plotted in such a manner that the important
points showing the slopes are squashed which makes it difficult to see the differences
between the three different DNA substrates. There is no need to include all the points in the
plateau or when plotting these data the plateau line can be interrupted to spread out the
important points at lower concentrations that will show clearer the slope differences in the
three graphs.
We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. All experimental points, including those near the
plateau region of the curve, are required for reliable fitting. We have added the Kd values for
ssDNA, dsDNA and forkDNA binding obtained from curve fitting, to Figure 8D in the revised
manuscript.
13. Figure 9. This shows a structural model of the yeast and human replisomal
subcomplexes involving Ctf4 or AND-1 and the replicative helicase MCM, Cdc45, GINS and
Pola, B, PriL and PriS in panels A and B and then a model of how the viral Tag helicase may
be recruited at the replisome by an interaction with the B subunit of Pola-B-PriS-PriL
complex. The legend for this figure needs to be more descriptive of the actual structural
model but also of the functional details. The Discussion references Figure 9 only once in the
very last paragraph and does not fully explain the models. The affinity differences between
ss, ds and fDNA are small to claim ssDNA specificity.
As requested by the reviewer, we have expanded our description of Figure 9 in the legend.
We have also made further, specific references to Figure 9 throughout the Discussion. We
feel that the Discussion of our findings and our resulting model for AND-1’s role at the
replication fork is already sufficiently detailed and extensive, and wouldn’t benefit from
further elaboration.
14. Materials and Methods; Lines 425-427. Firstly, reaction mixtures not reactions were run.
Secondly, it is pointless specifying voltage, % agarose and time of electrophoresis unless
one specifies the actual dimensions of a gel or the electrophoresis apparatus used. Different
size gels will run different under these conditions. Finally, all % quotes need to specify either
(w/v) or (v/v) to be consistent throughout the manuscript.
We have revised the Methods as suggested by the reviewer.

interaction may be mediated either by both N-terminal domains of Pola and B or by either C-
terminal domain of Pola and B. They should have done pull down experiments with the other
two combinations (suggested above) in order to show that both domains are involved.
4. Results; Lines 107-110. The authors refer to low sequence similarity between the SepB
structure and the Ctf4CTD but still their remarkable structural resemblance. This is somewhat
confusing for the reader who might get the impression from the introduction (see point 1
above) that AND-1 and Ctf4 are highly homologous. Therefore, it is important to specify here
clearly that the low sequence similarity refers to residues 329-826 of human AND-1 and the
Ctf4CTD giving the actual % identity/similarity and comparing this to the % identity/similarity
for the rest of the two proteins.
5. Results; Line 120 and Figure 2A and C. panels A and C in Figure 2 should be combined
into one panel also showing in a distinct different colour the location of the Pola-interacting
hydrophobic patch of AND-1 within the overall trimeric structure of the human AND-1 SepB
domains.
6. Results; Lines 133-135. The reference to Supplementary Figure S2 within this sentence is
misleading and confusing for the reader. The reader expects to see the M766 residue within
the putative Pola CIP-binding site in AND-1 and instead Supplementary Figure S2 shows a
comparison of the Pola CIP sequences from different species. Reference to Supplementary
Figure S2 should be moved to the previous sentence where they are actually discussion the
Pola CIP sequence and reference to Supplementary Figure S3 (which is missing from the
text in the manuscript) should be made instead in this sentence.
7. Results; Lines 156-159; What’s the meaning of “qualitatively similar”? Curiously, from the
gel shown in Figure 4A that the smallest fragment (MBP-AND-1(1017-1076) is somewhat
more effective at pulling down more GST-B(1-78) than the rest. It appears that the largest
MBP-AND-1(107-1129) has pulled down the least GST-B(1-78). Any idea why? Was this
experiment done only once? Since the pull down assay is well set up, perhaps concentration
titration experiments of GST-B(1-78) for each MBP-AND-1 fragment might reveal better
subtle affinity differences.
8. Lines 175-177. The MBP-HMG(A47E) mutant does show less pull down of GST-B(178)
compared to the wt MBP-HMG but reference to Supplementary Figure S5 is confusing as
that figure simply shows purified wt and mutant proteins and no affinity experiments. Again,
they could have done a GST-B(178) concentration titration pull down experiment with wt and
A47E mutant to compare subtle differences in affinities. Was this experiment done only
once?
9. Results; Figure 6A and 6C. Were these experiments done only once? As suggested
above, would concentration titration pull down experiments in the case of wt and AND-
1(M1051E) in Fig. 6B and in the case of plus BNT and plus Pola CIP in Fig. 6C be useful to
reveal subtle differences in affinities?
10. The AND-1/DNA gel shift data in Figure 7A is presented in an unusual manner. These
gel shift experiments need to be done in duplicate/triplicate and then a plot of % binding
versus concentration of AND-1 to be constructed to give comparative Kd values which can
then be compared to the Kd values obtained by fluorescence anisotropy in Figure 8D.
11. Figure 7B. Curiously the gel shift for AND-1(1-1129) is weaker than that of AND-1(837-
1129) which is inconsistent with the data shown in Figure 8E where the full length AND-1
(i.e. 1-1129) appears to bind better to DNA than AND-1(837-1129). There is also a mistake
in the labelling of the blue diamonds within the graph, they have been labelled as AND-1
827-1129 which needs to be corrected to AND-1 836-1129.
12. Figure 8D. Data in this graph have been plotted in such a manner that the important
points showing the slopes are squashed which makes it difficult to see the differences
between the three different DNA substrates. There is no need to include all the points in the
plateau or when plotting these data the plateau line can be interrupted to spread out the
important points at lower concentrations that will show clearer the slope differences in the
three graphs.
13. Figure 9. This shows a structural model of the yeast and human replisomal
subcomplexes involving Ctf4 or AND-1 and the replicative helicase MCM, Cdc45, GINS and
Pola, B, PriL and PriS in panels A and B and then a model of how the viral Tag helicase may
be recruited at the replisome by an interaction with the B subunit of Pola-B-PriS-PriL
complex. The legend for this figure needs to be more descriptive of the actual structural
model but also of the functional details. The Discussion references Figure 9 only once in the
very last paragraph and does not fully explain the models. The affinity differences between
ss, ds and fDNA are small to claim ssDNA specificity.
14. Materials and Methods; Lines 425-427. Firstly, reaction mixtures not reactions were run.
Secondly, it is pointless specifying voltage, % agarose and time of electrophoresis unless
one specifies the actual dimensions of a gel or the electrophoresis apparatus used. Different
size gels will run different under these conditions. Finally, all % quotes need to specify either
(w/v) or (v/v) to be consistent throughout the manuscript.
