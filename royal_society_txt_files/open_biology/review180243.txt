Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In this review, the authors discussed some recent experimental results about the cell fate or
identity commitment. Without doubt, this is an interesting topic in developmental biology.
In fact, since 1950s, Waddington’s epigenetic landscape is probably the most famous and most
powerful metaphor in developmental biology, which depicts how a cell progresses from an
undifferentiated state to one of a number of discrete, distinct, differentiated cell fates during
development. Waddington’s theory, however, strongly implies that the determination of cell fate
in the development should be considered to be a series process of dynamic bifurcation
determined by some crucial biochemical reaction dynamics. For example, a recent study on the
determination of Drosophila ovarian germline stem cell fate provided a strong experimental
evidence and dynamical analysis, in which there is a feedback loop with bistable regulation
induced by an external BMP signal (Curr. Biol. 22, 515 (2012)). In any case, the mechanism of
bistable (or multi-stable) regulation plays an important role in determining cell fate. Based on the
bistable regulation, Ferell developed the theoretical concept of cell-fate induction (Curr. Biol. 22,
R458 (2012)). Moreover, Chen et al. also pointed out that the fate differentiation of early
blastomeres is not only related to the random distribution of molecular signals during cell
division, but also depends on the subsequent bistable regulation mechanism (Development 142,
3468-3477 (2015)). So, I would suggest that, if it is possible, the authors include some new results
about the dynamical mechanism in the determination of cell fate in this review.

(Curr. Biol. 22, 515 (2012)). In any case, the mechanism of bistable (or multi-stable) regulation plays

the determination of cell fate in this review.
We thank reviewers for reviewing this manuscript and for providing us very insightful suggestions. We
have now followed reviewers’ comments and added one new paragraph with subtitle “Cell fate and
bistability” (line 21- line 42) and one new figure (new Figure 1) in the “Introduction” section to discuss
how bistable regulation mechanism governs cell fate determination. In this paragraph, many
references, including (Curr. Biol. 22, 515 (2012); (Curr. Biol. 22, R458 (2012) and (Development 142,
3468-3477 (2015) as suggested by the reviewers, have been properly cited. The detailed text, figure
and figure legend are shown below:
“Cell fate and bistability
Cell fate decision-making in stem cell lineages is often binary: that is, newly-born sibling cells ultimately
rest in two discrete, steady and switch-like equilibrium states (Balazsi et al., 2011; Bertrand and Hobert,
2010; Losick and Desplan, 2008). Such bistable cell fate specification can be achieved by either
intercellular or intracellular signaling network (Brandman and Meyer, 2008; Losick and Desplan, 2008).
Lateral inhibition is a typical intercellular competition that diversifies cell fates: two adjacent sibling cells
inhibit each other, eventually resulting in a winner cell and a loser cell that adopt mutually exclusive cell
fates (Figure 1). A classic example is Notch-Delta-mediated lateral inhibition, which has been
implicated in cell fate determination within various stem cell lineages (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999;
Koch et al., 2013). On the other hand, intracellular bistable regulation converts differential external or
intrinsic signals into binary cell fates (Ferrell, 2012; He et al., 2019; Homem et al., 2015; Jiang and
Edgar, 2012; Kohwi and Doe, 2013; Lehmann, 2012; Lin, 2008; Losick et al., 2011; Yoon et al., 2018)
(Figure 1). For example, in Drosophila ovarian germline stem cell (GSC) lineages, differential strengths
of niche-derived BMP signal can be sensed by a GSC and its sibling cystoblast cell, and converted into
bistable cell fates through cell-autonomous negative feedback loops (Xia et al., 2010; Xia et al., 2012).
For another instance, asymmetric segregation of Numb protein during mitosis dictate neural stem cell
versus neural progenitor/precursor binary cell fate decisions (Bowman et al., 2008; Brand and Livesey,
2011; Li et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2010; Song and Lu, 2011, 2012). Similar strategies are employed during
cell fate decision-making in a wide range of stem cell lineages (Ferrell, 2012), including the very first
cell fate differentiation events in early mammalian development (Shi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018).
The intercellular and intracellular regulatory strategies are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they are
complementary to each other and can be used in combination to confer differential cell fates in a
precise and robust manner.”
Figure1. Bistability can be achieved by intercellular competition or intracellular
signaling. Lateral inhibition (left) relies on intercellular competition between adjacent
daughter cells to confer mutually exclusive binary cell fates. Small initial difference
between adjacent daughter cells can be amplified and locked into distinct cell fates
through intercellular feedback loops. On the other hand, differential extracellular [such as
niche-derived ligand gradient (middle)] or intrinsic signals [such as asymmetric
distribution of cell fate determinants (right)] can dictate binary cell fate decisions via
intracellular signaling network.
