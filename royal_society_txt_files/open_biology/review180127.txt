In their manuscript, “Cancer-Malaria: Hidden Connections”, Nordor and colleagues address the
intriguing observation that there appears to be overlap between the molecular and cellular
mechanisms that mediate the control of cancer and malaria infections. While the topic is
interesting, the authors could do more to delve into the literature and also propose new ideas of
why these seeming disparate areas of research have overlapping molecular mediators.
Thematic concerns:
1. While the authors provide a substantial service to both fields by drawing attention to some of
the parallels between these two diseases, their evaluation of each field is somewhat cursory and
provides only a list of similarities without delving into what this means more globally. Thus, the
manuscript is simply a list of things that are involved in both diseases without any commentary
on if this would be expected by chance alone. Since there are a finite number of genes that
regulate critical central regulatory networks of a cell, one would expect that some genes regulate
more than one disease state.
2. There are multiple properties of cancers and infectious disease (beyond malaria) that highlight
potential rationale behind the molecular overlap observed. For example, the nutritional and
metabolic needs in the context of rapid growth and the relationship with hypoxia in solid tumors
and during infection. I encourage the authors to think about the fundamental properties that
may control these two disease that could be responsible for the molecular overlap, rather than
just picking out a few factors that regulate both systems.
3. There have been several studies that have evaluated the co-occurrence of malaria and cancer,
and none of these studies have been referenced. These should be briefly discussed in the second
paragraph, if the authors hope to draw a link between epidemiology of the two diseases.
4. The authors have largely failed to reference relevant literature. As a few examples, the
manuscript is missing references on lines 39, 47, 55, 93.
Detailed concerns:
1. On line 41, authors state that liver stage infection takes 2 weeks. It is typically thought to take
2-10 days in most malaria species, although can take longer for some more rare species. Dormant
forms can reside within the liver for months or years.
2. On line 53, the authors conclude that P. vivax is the predominant cause of malaria in South East
Asia, but in fact both P. vivax and P. falciparum are reasonably common in many parts of South
East Asia. P. malariae and P. ovale are also present, but more rarely observed.
3. In the paragraph beginning on line 86, the authors link cytoadhesion of iRBCs to the placenta
4
via VAR2CSA/CSA binding to the symptoms of placental malaria (PM). To my knowledge, the
pathogenesis of PM is multifactorial and likely is contributed to by cytoadhesion as well as
subsequent inflammatory events that lead to infiltration of immune cells.

Appendix A
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Nordor et al provides interesting examples of how
research activities in two very different human diseases can leverage
each other for mutual benefit. Although, the examples provided are
quite superficially described, the combined conclusion is important,
well articulated, and justified.
Minor issues to be addressed:
Content is acceptable. However, the manuscript would benefit from
language polishing. A few examples/suggestions listed below.
Line 9: points point to the need for understanding
Line 9 has been updated as suggested by Referee 1: Corrected
sentence to read as “for understanding” as suggested by Referee 1
Line 65: Lack of expression
We have updated the sentence as suggested by Referee 1 on Line
76: “Therefore, lack of expression of this cell surface receptor on
RBCs suggests an evolutionary mechanism of protection against
malaria infection at the evolutionary price of more severe cancers”.
Line 72-74: Please delete: – a lost of functional activity
We deleted the words on now Line 82 “ a lost of functional activity” as
suggested by Referee 1. The sentence now reads: “Among these
molecules, PD-L1, expressed on the surface of tumors and antigen-
presenting cells, interacts with PD-1, expressed on the surface of
lymphocyte T cells, and this interaction eventually sends a negative
signal to T cells”.
Line 82: infected with
We updated the sentence with the word “infected” as suggested by
Referee 1 on Line 89: “Moreover, they showed that blockade of PD-
L1 and LAG-3 – another intensively investigated immune checkpoint
molecule – restored T cell function and cleared blood-stage malaria in
mice infected with P. yoelii”.
Line 102: please remove the first ‘disease’ word.
We have deleted ‘disease’ so the sentence now reads on Line 110
as: “These results demonstrate how insight gained on a protein that
an infectious agent uses to target human cells can be leveraged to
target a non-communicable and devastating disease – cancer – and
potentially benefit human health”.
Line 107: please substitute ‘situation’ with ‘problem’.
We replaced the word ‘situation’ with the word ‘problem’ so the
sentence on Line 133 now reads: “At the medical level, it might
already bias the management of patients affected with both malaria
and cancer, an increasing problem in developing countries”.
Line 108: please substitute ‘even’ with ‘also’
We replaced the word ‘even with ‘also’ as suggested by Referee 1 on
Line 135: “Hidden links between malaria and cancer also points to
potential inefficiencies in the organization of research on diseases”.

Comments to the Author(s)
In their manuscript, “Cancer-Malaria: Hidden Connections”, Nordor
and colleagues address the intriguing observation that there appears
to be overlap between the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
mediate the control of cancer and malaria infections. While the topic
is interesting, the authors could do more to delve into the literature
and also propose new ideas of why these seeming disparate areas of
research have overlapping molecular mediators.
Thematic concerns:
1. While the authors provide a substantial service to both
fields by drawing attention to some of the parallels between
these two diseases, their evaluation of each field is somewhat
cursory and provides only a list of similarities without delving
into what this means more globally. Thus, the manuscript is
simply a list of things that are involved in both diseases without
any commentary on if this would be expected by chance
alone. Since there are a finite number of genes that regulate
critical central regulatory networks of a cell, one would expect
that some genes regulate more than one disease state.
We have added a paragraph from Line 113 to 123 and Lines 124 to
130:
“It is important to note that the unexpected connections between
malaria and cancer are not unique to the two diseases but are among
those across several diseases at the molecular and epidemiological
levels. At the molecular level, it is imperative that since cells have a
finite number of genes, many of which are pleiotropic, distinct
diseases are bound to interact with the same set of genes.
Furthermore, many diseases may perturb similar metabolic and/or
immunological processes leading to dependencies between the
distinct diseases. At the epidemiological level, disease comorbidities
may also arise due to share environmental risk factors. In this
commentary, we focus on malaria and cancer as the two diseases are
commonly viewed as fundamentally distinct: whereas malaria is an
infectious disease, cancer is non-communicable. It is rare to find
collaborations between researchers in the two disease areas or
researchers working on the two diseases simultaneously”.
“The examples provided in this commentary are by no means
exhaustive of the connections that may exist between malaria and
cancer. However, we have chosen these examples as illustrative for
a number of reasons: i) the connections between cancer and malaria
presented here would not have been easily predicted and were
discovered serendipitously, ii) these connections cover distinct
developmental stages of the malaria parasite, and iii) the connections
between cancer and malaria considered here show how insights from
cancer can be used to find new ways of combatting malaria and vice
versa”.
2. There are multiple properties of cancers and infectious
disease (beyond malaria) that highlight potential rationale behind
the molecular overlap observed. For example, the nutritional and
metabolic needs in the context of rapid growth and the
relationship with hypoxia in solid tumors and during infection. I
encourage the authors to think about the fundamental properties
that may control these two disease that could be responsible for
the molecular overlap, rather than just picking out a few factors
that regulate both systems.
We have added a paragraph from Line 113 to 123 and Lines 124 to
130 which address this concern and the previous one above.
3. There have been several studies that have evaluated the co-
occurrence of malaria and cancer, and none of these studies
have been referenced. These should be briefly discussed in the
second paragraph, if the authors hope to draw a link between
epidemiology of the two diseases.
We have responded in Lines 14 to 20 and Lines 21 to 26 by adding
new references and the paragraphs below:
“For example, long-term exposure to malaria infection in African
populations led to selection of a variant of the Duffy antigen protein
associated with reduced susceptibility to malaria (2,3). While this gene
variant evolved to confer protection against malaria, recent evidence
suggests that it also influences inflammatory responses that are
important in diseases such as cancer (4). Consequently, this gene
variant selected for malaria could also impact the health of individuals
of African ancestry including those not living in areas with malaria.”
With respect to possible epidemiological associations between
malaria and cancer, previous studies indicate that the prevalence of
malaria is correlated with that of endemic Burkitt Lymphoma (5) but
negatively correlated with all-cause mortality across multiple cancers
(6). Today, the burden of malaria is decreasing in several countries
where the disease has been endemic, while cancer cases are rising in
many of those regions, specifically in Sub-Saharan Africa (7).
4. The authors have largely failed to reference relevant
literature. As a few examples, the manuscript is missing
references on lines 39, 47, 55, 93.
We have added references in the sentence (Line 47) “Such research
effort would have to start with programs aiming at deciphering the role
of p53 in human malaria, as initial studies demonstrating its role in the
disease have been in rodent malaria (8,9)”.
We have added appropriate reference on Line 56: “Among these cell
surface receptors is the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines
(DARC), which is used by the P. vivax malaria species to invade
RBCs (2).
We have added a reference in Line 64: “DARC is a decoy chemokine
receptor binding both C-C and C-X-C chemokines, but it lacks the
capacity to couple to G-proteins, thereby failing to elicit immunological
reactions (10)”.
We have also added a reference on Line 66: “Consequently, DARC
can sequester chemokines in circulation and in the process dampen
immunological responses. DARC has been demonstrated to be
important in cancer in at least two ways. First, the ability of DARC to
sequester chemokines could lower the concentrations of chemokines
required for cancer metastasis and tumor neovascularization (11,12).”
We have added references on Lines 101 and 104: “VAR2CSA
contains six Duffy binding-like domains that bind to chondroitin sulfate
A (CSA), a glycosaminoglycan expressed on the placental surface
(17). Interestingly, CSA is also present on the surface of several
malignant cells where it is linked to proteoglycans including CD44 and
CSPG4 (18,19)”.
Detailed concerns:
1. On line 41, authors state that liver stage infection takes 2
weeks. It is typically thought to take 2-10 days in most malaria
species, although can take longer for some more rare species.
Dormant forms can reside within the liver for months or years.
We have updated this section appropriately now on Line 50:
“Hepatocyte development of malaria parasites takes about 2 to 10
days in most malaria species during which infected individuals remain
asymptomatic”.
2. On line 53, the authors conclude that P. vivax is the
predominant cause of malaria in South East Asia, but in fact both
P. vivax and P. falciparum are reasonably common in many parts
of South East Asia. P. malariae and P. ovale are also present,
but more rarely observed.
We have updated the sentence in Line 62: “This explains the low
levels of P. vivax malaria in Africans as compared to South East Asia,
where both P. vivax and P. falciparum infections are common”.
3. In the paragraph beginning on line 86, the authors link
cytoadhesion of iRBCs to the placenta via VAR2CSA/CSA
binding to the symptoms of placental malaria (PM). To my
knowledge, the pathogenesis of PM is multifactorial and likely is
contributed to by cytoadhesion as well as subsequent
inflammatory events that lead to infiltration of immune cells.
We have modified the sentence on Line 100 to be more specific
without claiming any causal link between cytoadhesion and
pathogenesis: “Malaria parasites sequester in the placenta by using
its variant surface antigen (VAR2CSA) to adhere to the placenta
(16,17).”
