The paper reports the first crystal structure of human RIOK2. In the structure, the enzyme is in
complex with a representative of a series of RIOK2-binding ligands that were identified
previously by some of the authors (Varin et al. BBA 1854:1630-1636).
The structure is of excellent quality and, being the first of human RIOK2, constitutes a significant
advance. The analysis of the structure reported in the manuscript is well done and worthy of
publication.
The ligands are referred to in the title and throughout the paper as 'inhibitors'. Perhaps the term
'inhibitor' is not appropritate since no data is presented that shows these compounds inhibit an
aspect of the enzyme's activity.
Since the napthalene moiety of ligand 9 is interposed at non-cystallographic intermolecular
interfaces at several places in the asymmetric unit (and no apo- or nucleotide-bound RIOK2
structure is presented) it seems likely that the ligand has in fact been crystallogenic. If this is the
case, the authors should comment upon this.
The ligand seems to be bound primarily via a pyridine group and the hinge-binding motif while
the distal portion of the ligand lies at the mouth of the nucleotide-binding pocket and is not well-
ordered in the crystal structure except when it is stabilized by an adjacent molecule. The authors
claim that this portion of the ligand (a napthalene group in ligand 9) forms 'extensive
hydrophobic interactions with residues at the entrance to the ATP-binding site'. However, there
is doubt about the extent to which the position and interactions of the napthalene group in the
structure reflects those of RIOK2-ligand complexes in solution and MD simulations suggest some
mobility. This group is apparently responsible for much of the selectivity of the ligand, so the
lack of clarity about it is unfortunate, however the uncertainty is investigated to a reasonable
degree and is described well in the manuscript.
The manuscript might be improved by generating the M101I, I111H and I109V mutants of RIOK2,
and perhaps the triple mutant, to mimic RIOK1/3 and measuring the affinities of these mutants
for ligand 9 in order to investigate experimentally whether, as the authors propose, these residues
are molecular determinants of selectivity for RIOK2 over RIOK1 and 3.

In the paper ‘Crystal structure of human RIOK2 bound to a specific inhibitor’ submitted by Jing
Wang et al. The authors report the first crystal structure of an inhibitor to the atypical kinase
RIOK2. Here the authors implement protein purification, crystallisation, X-ray structural
determination, ITC, fluorescence based cellular assay, and molecular dynamics. The authors
present a suitable body of work, that is well designed and executed. The MS is also well written
and a nice light read. The study is of interest to the kinase/small molecule community
Introduction
Line 77/78 – use of ‘Rio2’ I assume this is how RIOK2 is referred to in (18)?
Results
Line 95 – remove the word ‘protein’s’
Line 153 – ‘Rio2’ usage again
Fig.2 – In C & D could you rotate the chem draw pyridine to mimic its binding mode, i.e both N
on same side (I know it is small thing just looks neater) as you have drawn it in Fig.4
Discussion
Line 239 – ‘The previously determined dissociation constants for this inhibitor series……’ I am
mildly confused with this and the origins of the SAR (Varin et al) when I read the paper in
4
absence of referring to the Varin et al work. How I review this is that the SAR are both against
RIOK2, the reported Kd in this paper for compounds 9 and 10 are determined via ITC. But the
Varin et al SAR is not clear the method used to obtain Kd’s in this paper. Need to reference the
KdELECT DiscoveRx displacement method here, otherwise, hard to compare the 393 and 349nM
reported from ITC for compounds 9 and 10 against Fig.4 with 520 and 160nM for 9 and 10,
respectively. I have no problem with the measurements and the authors interpretations, I would
just like a little clarity of the origins.

The paper reports the first crystal structure of human RIOK2. In the structure, the

were identified previously by some of the authors (Varin et al. BBA 1854:1630-

The structure is of excellent quality and, being the first of human RIOK2, constitutes
a significant advance. The analysis of the structure reported in the manuscript is
well done and worthy of publication.
We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation and address the individual
remarks below.
The ligands are referred to in the title and throughout the paper as 'inhibitors'.
Perhaps the term 'inhibitor' is not appropritate since no data is presented that
shows these compounds inhibit an aspect of the enzyme's activity.
It is true that our manuscript and the previous publication concerning this inhibitor
series show binding assays rather than an assay to measure ATP consumption or
ADP production, however since the molecules bind in the ATP binding site we think
it is a reasonable conclusion that they inhibit the enzymatic activity of RIOK2.
Since the napthalene moiety of ligand 9 is interposed at non-cystallographic
intermolecular interfaces at several places in the asymmetric unit (and no apo- or
nucleotide-bound RIOK2 structure is presented) it seems likely that the ligand has in
fact been crystallogenic. If this is the case, the authors should comment upon this.
We have added a sentence “As compound 9 appears at the interface between
RIOK2 molecules in the crystal it may have been essential for the successful
crystallisation.” To the end of the first paragraph of the results section “RIOK2 is
monomeric in solution including in the presence of the inhibitor” on page 11.
The ligand seems to be bound primarily via a pyridine group and the hinge-binding
motif while the distal portion of the ligand lies at the mouth of the nucleotide-
binding pocket and is not well-ordered in the crystal structure except when it is
stabilized by an adjacent molecule. The authors claim that this portion of the ligand
(a napthalene group in ligand 9) forms 'extensive hydrophobic interactions with
residues at the entrance to the ATP-binding site'. However, there is doubt about
the extent to which the position and interactions of the napthalene group in the
structure reflects those of RIOK2-ligand complexes in solution and MD simulations
suggest some mobility. This group is apparently responsible for much of the
selectivity of the ligand, so the lack of clarity about it is unfortunate, however the
uncertainty is investigated to a reasonable degree and is described well in the
manuscript.
We agree that it is a difficult question to resolve: how exactly does the naphthalene
contribute to the compound binding affinity in terms of binding energetics.
The manuscript might be improved by generating the M101I, I111H and I109V
mutants of RIOK2, and perhaps the triple mutant, to mimic RIOK1/3 and measuring
the affinities of these mutants for ligand 9 in order to investigate experimentally
whether, as the authors propose, these residues are molecular determinants of
selectivity for RIOK2 over RIOK1 and 3.
It would be interesting, as the reviewer suggests, to generate mutants of RIOK2 and
measure the binding affinities of the various inhibitors and compare these to their
affinities against RIOK1 and RIOK3 however this would be a large study and we think
outside the scope of this work.

Introduction
Line 77/78 – use of ‘Rio2’ I assume this is how RIOK2 is referred to in (18)?
Yes, the equivalent yeast enzyme is known as Rio2.
Results
Line 95 – remove the word ‘protein’s’
We have removed the word.
Line 153 – ‘Rio2’ usage again
This line refers again to the yeast Rio2.
Fig.2 – In C & D could you rotate the chem draw pyridine to mimic its binding mode,
i.e both N on same side (I know it is small thing just looks neater) as you have drawn
it in Fig.4
We have made this change to include the compounds drawn in the same orientation
as Fig. 4.
Discussion
Line 239 – ‘The previously determined dissociation constants for this inhibitor
series……’ I am mildly confused with this and the origins of the SAR (Varin et al)
when I read the paper in absence of referring to the Varin et al work. How I review
this is that the SAR are both against RIOK2, the reported Kd in this paper for
compounds 9 and 10 are determined via ITC. But the Varin et al SAR is not clear the

We have modified this sentence to say “The previously determined dissociation
constants for this inhibitor series [22] using the DiscoverX KdELECT measurement
method….”
