Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The authors give a broad overview of the state-of-the-art of immunotherapy. They make a
specific distinction between tumours with a high versus low mutation burden. In the end, the
authors propose that it is about time that the field should also focus on the initiation of
immunotherapeutic trials for the low mutation burden category. This specific message is timely
and important for a broad readership of specialists and non-specialists in the field.
However, this reviewer has a number of major concerns:
- The majority of the review (and abstract) is focused on general immunotherapeutic approaches
instead of specific ones of tumours with a low mutation burden. Therefore, the title may be
misleading compared to the content. Moreover, in the chapter of Immunotherapies for tumours
with low mutation burden, several opportunities and threats are described. However, the
majority of these are applicable to any tumour, thus also the ones with high mutation burden.
Because of the lack of focus specifically on tumours with a low mutation burden, this reviewer
thinks that this passage should be thoroughly reorganized/rewritten to be more specific.
- In the introduction, the authors only describe targeted immunotherapy as the use of specific
antibodies, while in the late 90s / early 00s also TCR and CAR transgenic strategies were being
developed. This should be introduced here as well.
- The chapter of Antigens targeted by cancer immunotherapy is disorganized, incoherent and
sometimes factually incorrect/incomplete. Topics are not introduced in a logical order and the
meaning of some sentences is unclear to this reviewer. This chapter should be throroughly
revised. Some specific points as examples, although total (textual and substantive) revision is
recommended:
57-63 MHC class II also presents antigens with an intracellular origin (in the majority of cases
actually) and vice versa for MHC class I. Upregulated MHC class II expression in tumors has
been thoroughly studied, it is unclear which mechanisms the authors still want to be elucidated
and what the relation of this is to immunotherapy?
73-75 This is incorrectly formulated, peripheral tolerance is only a minor part of the problem.
Affinity and expression elsewhere are the additional major issues for these targets. Thus T cells
against these targets are not necessarily less efficient.
3
77-95 Data on classical tumor antigens are missing: e.g. MART1 should be mentioned and for NY-
ESO, there are way more efforts than presumed in the current text.
87-88 The investigators of refs 29 and 30 do not use clones.
98-100 This meaning of this sentence is unclear.
- 182-203 The major obstacle, a lack of clinical responses to most vaccination strategies (not in
combination with checkpoint inhibitors), is not properly discussed. This may even be put in
perspective with a potential benefit in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, although such
hypothetical benefit still needs to be proven in phase III clinical trials.
- References to support strong statements are missing if available at all. Examples:
13 and also throughout the review: Checkpoint blockade does not mainly target neo-antigens, but
generally activates T cells. It should be described as such or substantiated by original research
facts.
46-48 The assumption that checkpoint blockade is particularly effective for the treatment of
cancers containing neo-antigens seems to be merely an opinion rather than based on the
referenced literature.
126-128 Reference(s) to original research papers proving the specific statements are needed.
241-243 Reference(s) to original research papers proving the importance of neo-antigen presence
for a potent immune response are needed.
- Some statements do not make sense to this reviewer and should be reconsidered, refined or
removed.
299-301 Of course this depends on the detection method, but usually tetramers are being used.
Without prior predictions, this would mean for each non-synonymous mutation, that 8 octamers,
9 nonamers, 10 decamers etc should be tested for sometimes 6 HLA-alleles. In case of a low
mutation burden of only 10 non-synonymous SNPs, this would still mean that at least 1620
different tetramers should be used. Thus this reviewer thinks that this statement does not make
any sense.
313-317 These are again nonsense statements. Anchor residue alterations often largely impact
MHC binding affinity, possibly resulting in the absence of the wild type counterpart. And there
are many examples of antigens with mutations in the TCR recognized residues that fully
determine T cell recognition. In both cases, the neo-antigens are potentially highly immunogenic
(as the authors themselves also implicate in lines 96-98). Therefore, this reviewer thinks that this
passage is not substantiated by data and should be removed.
323-324 Why would this not be benificial for tumors with a high mutation burden? Also in the
category of non-responders to checkpoint blockade?
Minor comments:
150 Co-stimulation and ACT have hardly been introduced and this discussion seems misplaced
in the middle of a checkpoint inhibitor discussion. One way to overcome that is by moving lines
144-152 down in the manuscript.
4
155 Please explain the type 1 inflammatory profile.
232-233 Sentence is completely unclear.
236 It would be nice if one or two lines are spend to discuss why solid tumor CARs are not yet
booming.
248-250 The first question is not well formulated and does not seem an important question in the
field. The second question however is a provocative one and should remain in the manuscript.
254-255 Can the authors support this by a reference, as the upregulation of IDO and Tregs may
just be correlated without causality.
267-269 The effectiveness of checkpoint blockade for the treatment of Hodgkin is not necessarily
through targeting of tumor PD-L1, the authors should attenuate their statements.
272-276 For RCC, another line of evidence that this tumor is immunogeneic is the occurence of
graft-versus-tumor effects after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Multiple times in the manuscript: "existance" should be written as "existence".

The authors present a review of the current use of cancer immunotherapy with focus on
strategies to expand its use to the majority of tumours which lack hypermutation. The manuscript
is well written, and covers most of the major areas in this important field. I have a few minor
suggestions for improvements.
Title
Should note that this Review refers to cancer. Also the current phrasing is rather odd. Suggest:
“Current and future scope of cancer immunotherapy: opening the door to tumours with low
mutation burden”
Text
Given the title, the section on improving responsiveness to checkpoint inhibition in non-
hypermutated cancers could be expanded. For example, the authors may wish to discuss the
emerging role for epigenetic therapies in this area – reviewed in PMID: 29432557.

Dear Dr. Glover,
We are ecstatic with the acceptance of our manuscript in Open Biology. We are also
very grateful for the invaluable criticism by the reviewers which resulted, to our
opinion, in a significant improvement of the manuscript. Below follows a point-by-
point answer to the reviewer’s comments which are fully addressed in the current
version of the manuscript.
Referee: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors give a broad overview of the state-of-the-art of immunotherapy. They make a
specific distinction between tumours with a high versus low mutation burden. In the end, the
authors propose that it is about time that the field should also focus on the initiation of
immunotherapeutic trials for the low mutation burden category. This specific message is
timely and important for a broad readership of specialists and non-specialists in the field.
We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and are happy that the current work can be
recognized as valuable in the field.
However, this reviewer has a number of major concerns:
- The majority of the review (and abstract) is focused on general immunotherapeutic
approaches instead of specific ones of tumours with a low mutation burden. Therefore, the
title may be misleading compared to the content. Moreover, in the chapter of
Immunotherapies for tumours with low mutation burden, several opportunities and threats
are described. However, the majority of these are applicable to any tumour, thus also the
ones with high mutation burden. Because of the lack of focus specifically on tumours with a
low mutation burden, this reviewer thinks that this passage should be thoroughly
reorganized/rewritten to be more specific.
We agree with the reviewer that the title did not fully reflect the content of the review.
In that respect we have reorganized the review as such so that the applicability of
immunotherapies for tumours with low mutation burden is discussed to a greater
extent. Furthermore, we have modified the title so that it more accurately represents
the contents of this review. The new title is Cancer immunotherapy: broadening the
scope of targetable tumours.
- In the introduction, the authors only describe targeted immunotherapy as the use of specific
antibodies, while in the late 90s / early 00s also TCR and CAR transgenic strategies were
being developed. This should be introduced here as well.
We thank the reviewer for noting this and, accordingly, we now refer to CAR
therapies as another form of targeted therapy which followed antibody-based
strategies (lines 41 – 46).
- The chapter of Antigens targeted by cancer immunotherapy is disorganized, incoherent and
sometimes factually incorrect/incomplete. Topics are not introduced in a logical order and
the meaning of some sentences is unclear to this reviewer. This chapter should be thoroughly
revised. Some specific points as examples, although total (textual and substantive) revision is
recommended:
As appropriately proposed by the reviewer we have extensively reformatted the
current chapter for clarity and content.
57-63 MHC class II also presents antigens with an intracellular origin (in the majority of cases
actually) and vice versa for MHC class I. Upregulated MHC class II expression in tumors has
been thoroughly studied, it is unclear which mechanisms the authors still want to be
elucidated and what the relation of this is to immunotherapy?
We agree with the reviewer that it was over-simplified and incorrect to refer to the
origin of HLA class I/II antigens in the previous form. In order to avoid introducing
extra complexity in this review we have removed the statement and instead refer
solely to the importance of the role of HLA class I as an ubiquitously expressed,
antigen-presenting molecule throughout the organisms (lines 54, 55) and to the
interaction between HLA class I and II with CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the context of
antigen presentation (lines 63 – 66).
Although we agree that the expression of MHC class II in tumour cells has been
extensively reported, we consider that its biological and functional significance
requires further elucidation. In addition, we also consider that, at the moment, it is
unknown whether this feature can be exploited from an immunotherapeutic point of
view. To reflect this point of view with greater clarity we have now included the
following sentence: HLA class II expression is also known to occur in some tumour
types although its functional significance and how it can be exploited from an
immunotherapeutic point of view require further investigation (lines 67-69).
73-75 This is incorrectly formulated, peripheral tolerance is only a minor part of the problem.
Affinity and expression elsewhere are the additional major issues for these targets. Thus T
cells against these targets are not necessarily less efficient.
We agree with the reviewer and have rephrased this section to highlight that the
expression of self-antigens in healthy tissues is a major issue for the success of these
therapies due to central tolerance (lines 76 – 77), but also for serious side effects in
case of the presence of T cells with high avidity for such antigens (81 – 83).
77-95 Data on classical tumor antigens are missing: e.g. MART1 should be mentioned and for
NY-ESO, there are way more efforts than presumed in the current text.
We have now considerably expanded the references to such antigens in lines 79 – 81.
gp100, MART-1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1 are presented and 4 references have
been included.
87-88 The investigators of refs 29 and 30 do not use clones.
This section has been removed in the current version of the manuscript in order to
improve the focus of the current review.
98-100 This meaning of this sentence is unclear.
We agree with the judgement of the reviewer and have therefore rephrased the
sentence to improve its clarity (lines 86 – 90).
- 182-203 The major obstacle, a lack of clinical responses to most vaccination strategies (not
in combination with checkpoint inhibitors), is not properly discussed. This may even be put in
perspective with a potential benefit in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, although such
hypothetical benefit still needs to be proven in phase III clinical trials.
We have now included references to the lack of clinical responses to most vaccination
strategies, particularly when dealing with neo-antigens. We consider that we still lack
enough studies to evaluate the merit of neo-antigen vaccination in a personalized
setting. Before the advent of next-generation sequencing, such strategies would focus
on commonly mutated targets (cancer genes) which we propose to be poor
immunotherapeutic targets as deduced by their positive selection in the context of
tumorigenesis. (lines 95 – 99, 189 - 192)
- References to support strong statements are missing if available at all. Examples:
We thank the reviewer for this comment and apologize for not providing all adequate
references in the previous version of the manuscript. This issue has been carefully
addressed throughout the whole manuscript.
13 and also throughout the review: Checkpoint blockade does not mainly target neo-
antigens, but generally activates T cells. It should be described as such or substantiated by
original research facts.
We have not included references in the abstract section but we have now expanded
the literature basis for claiming that checkpoint blockade is particularly effective in
tumours with high mutation burden (please see following comment)
46-48 The assumption that checkpoint blockade is particularly effective for the treatment of
cancers containing neo-antigens seems to be merely an opinion rather than based on the
referenced literature.

241-243 Reference(s) to original research papers proving the importance of neo-antigen
presence for a potent immune response are needed.
In addition to the previous references we have now included a review (Schumacher et al.
Science 2015) that proposes the referred threshold. Furthermore, we rephrased the sentence
since the proposed number of somatic mutations was suggested but has not been defined
through experimental evidence or consensus in the field (lines 220 – 222).
- Some statements do not make sense to this reviewer and should be reconsidered, refined or
removed.
299-301 Of course this depends on the detection method, but usually tetramers are being
used. Without prior predictions, this would mean for each non-synonymous mutation, that 8
octamers, 9 nonamers, 10 decamers etc should be tested for sometimes 6 HLA-alleles. In case
of a low mutation burden of only 10 non-synonymous SNPs, this would still mean that at
least 1620 different tetramers should be used. Thus this reviewer thinks that this statement
does not make any sense.
This is a very important point by the reviewer. While writing this section we had in mind the
use of long peptides to test mutation targets and did not consider tetramer testing or direct
stimulation with short peptides as an option. We have therefore rephrased this section to
include peptide prediction when employing short peptides for the detection of reactive T cells
(lines 280 – 284)
313-317 These are again nonsense statements. Anchor residue alterations often largely
impact MHC binding affinity, possibly resulting in the absence of the wild type counterpart.
And there are many examples of antigens with mutations in the TCR recognized residues that
fully determine T cell recognition. In both cases, the neo-antigens are potentially highly
immunogenic (as the authors themselves also implicate in lines 96-98). Therefore, this
reviewer thinks that this passage is not substantiated by data and should be removed.
We agree with the reviewer that this sentence was not correct as it failed to convey the
message we intended to. We now maintain the statement that neo-antigens derived
from point mutations conserve considerable homology to their wild-type counterparts.
And if (and we specifically use a conditional tense) such alterations do not result in
substantial changes in terms of binding affinity or peptide structure they might fail to
activate cells with high avidity. This sentence serves the purpose of establishing a
contrast with the great immunogenic potential of frameshift peptides (lines 104 –
111).
323-324 Why would this not be benificial for tumors with a high mutation burden? Also in
the category of non-responders to checkpoint blockade?
Indeed non-responding tumours with high mutational burden could also benefit from
similar strategies. This is now specifically referred throughout the chapter.
Minor comments:
150 Co-stimulation and ACT have hardly been introduced and this discussion seems
misplaced in the middle of a checkpoint inhibitor discussion. One way to overcome that is by
moving lines 144-152 down in the manuscript.
We thank the reviewer and agree with the suggestion. We have therefore moved these
sections as suggested (lines 165 – 173).
155 Please explain the type 1 inflammatory profile.
We now refer to type 1 inflammatory profile as IFN-gamma and IL-2-driven immune
responses (lines 151 – 153).
232-233 Sentence is completely unclear.
We have rephrased this sentence (lines 208 – 210).
236 It would be nice if one or two lines are spend to discuss why solid tumor CARs are not yet
booming.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and now specifically refer to issues that
might impact the application of CAR T cell therapies for the treatment of solid
tumours including the availability of targetable antigens and homing of the CAR T
cells (lines 212 – 215).
248-250 The first question is not well formulated and does not seem an important question
in the field. The second question however is a provocative one and should remain in the
manuscript.
We have improved this section in order to improve its clarity. We do consider that the
first question should remain as before establishing whether few neo-antigens are
enough to initiate a competent immune response one should determine whether they
are indeed being presented (lines 227 – 231).
254-255 Can the authors support this by a reference, as the upregulation of IDO and Tregs
may just be correlated without causality.
We now included the following reference to support our statement:
118. Munn DH, Mellor AL. IDO in the Tumor Microenvironment: Inflammation, Counter-
Regulation, and Tolerance. Trends in immunology. 2016;37(3):193-207.
267-269 The effectiveness of checkpoint blockade for the treatment of Hodgkin is not
necessarily through targeting of tumor PD-L1, the authors should attenuate their statements.
The reviewer makes a valid point. We have therefore attenuated the previous
statement (lines 247 – 250).
272-276 For RCC, another line of evidence that this tumor is immunogeneic is the occurence
of graft-versus-tumor effects after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Although we understand and appreciate the suggestion by the reviewer, we refer
throughout the manuscript to immunogenicity in an autologous setting which does not
encompass allogeneic graft-vs-host disease.
Multiple times in the manuscript: "existance" should be written as "existence".
We have corrected this misspelling throughout the manuscript (lines 247 – 248, 266 –
269).

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present a review of the current use of cancer immunotherapy with focus on
strategies to expand its use to the majority of tumours which lack hypermutation. The
manuscript is well written, and covers most of the major areas in this important field. I have
a few minor suggestions for improvements.
We are very thankful for the comments of the reviewer.
Title
Should note that this Review refers to cancer. Also the current phrasing is rather odd.
Suggest: “Current and future scope of cancer immunotherapy: opening the door to tumours
with low mutation burden”
We thank the suggestion of the reviewer and have modified this title altogether to
better match the content of the review.
Text
Given the title, the section on improving responsiveness to checkpoint inhibition in non-
hypermutated cancers could be expanded. For example, the authors may wish to discuss the
emerging role for epigenetic therapies in this area – reviewed in PMID: 29432557.
We thank the reviewer for his suggestion. We have included now a section dedicated
to epigenetic modifications in a therapeutic setting and included the reference
provided by the reviewer (lines 311 – 322).
Line 9: should read "Cancer immunotherapy *has* experienced striking advances"
We have adapted this sentence accordingly (line 8).
Line 12: should read "Cutting edge technologies have allowed us…"
This sentence has been completely adapted (lines 11 – 13).
Once again, we would like to express our gratitude to the reviewers. They
have significantly contributed towards the improvement of this manuscript. We thank
the editor for the opportunity to publish our work at Open Biology.
