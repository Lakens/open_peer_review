Spatial organisation of different sigma factor activities in the E. coli biofilm
The work, which is well presented in this clearly written manuscript, provides an analysis of
sigma factor activity in the context of the 3D E. coli biofilm. The authors accomplish this using a
combination of reporter fusions that were designed, using a synthetic biology approach, to
respond to different sigma factors. The promoters were tested for specificity using lacZ fusions,
and then utilized in the biofilm using a fluorescent report fusion. When the biofilm formed by
strains carrying these reporters were sectioned and imaged, the spatial (and temporal)
distribution of activity became apparent.
Comments:
For the cells where there is short range heterogeneity in expression in a similar zone of the
biofilm, can the authors rule out the fact that for some reason the cells might have lost, or reduced
the copy number of, the plasmid used to carry the reporter fusion?
Why does the yhijD mRNA display predominantly as a doublet band?
Minor editorial comments:

line 466- change mm to um! That would have been a big biofilm.

In this manuscript, the authors construct Gfp reporter fusions that allowed visualization of gene
expression in cryo-sectioned macrocolony biofilms on agar. The data show that spatial
stratification of gene expression within macrocolony biofilms, which the authors correlate to
transcriptome level expression involving different sigma subunits of RNAP, stringent control of
ribosomal gene expression and c-di-GMP signaling. The authors compare these results to a
phenotypic analysis of long range patterns of metabolic stratification and short range
heterogeneity. Finally, the authors use these results to argue against some current ideas of biofilm
development, such as the concept of a genetic developmental program akin to those in
eukaryotes, the idea of self-organization in Eps molecules, and so forth, in favor of micro-
environmental conditions and bacterial responses in the form of global gene regulation.
I think this is a strong paper. Experiments are well integrated with their guiding hypotheses, and
well executed. (In fact, technically, this paper is a kind of tour de force.) The manuscript itself is
clearly written for the most part. I think this is a very interesting study and I recommend
publication.
However, as with papers of this kind, there will be lots of questions. I don’t think it is fair to the
authors to have them answer all of them in a single paper. Conceptual shifts in a field require the
participation and iterative response of the field itself in subsequent publications, rather than just
answering referee questions in a single, increasingly dense paper. Having said that, I restrict
myself to a few questions which I hope the authors will address.
What kind of metabolic loads do the gfp fusions impart (and how do the authors expect the
loading to modify the answer?) I imagine that this will be especially impactful for cells teetering
between vegetative and stationary physiology.
I am not particularly invested in a biofilm model based on self organization or developmental
program(s). In fact, I am a bit irritated by some of the loose language that has been used.
However, I think it is important to think about how much of an ‘either/or’ we have between the
scenario the authors see here, and the ideas implicit in self organization / development. I am not
so sure that the demarcation is as clean as the authors suggest.
The observation of spatial anticorrelation between PDE PdeH and CsgD is nice. About the
physiological stratification: does the quantitative organization of stratification (thickness of
layers) make sense based on published diffusion lengths of oxygen, nutrients, waste products?
4
Does the level of stratification depend then on the richness of the medium?
What is the emerging picture that we glean about living biofilms from these results on
cryosectioned biofilms? The authors already have comments on this topic of course. For example,
do we expect high cell motility in these lower matrix free layers of macrocolonies from the low c-
di-GMP levels?
These are some minor technical questions:
Figure 2B:
It is not clear how this plot is used to calculate the promoter activity described in line 272.
Also, should the tacP promoter activity be on this plot too? To show the baseline levels as a
reference?
Figures 3,4:
Is there some numerical quantification of the pictures to more easily see the comparisons talked
about in lines 339-343 and 348-350? It is hard to see the comparison between fluorescence images
and blot images. For example, for the fluorescence pictures, can you take the average fluorescence
as a function of the z-height? And for the blot images, the average blot intensity? I think these
suggested additions may be helpful to the reader.

Spatial organisation of different sigma factor activities in the E. coli biofilm
The work, which is well presented in this clearly written manuscript, provides an
analysis of sigma factor activity in the context of the 3D E. coli biofilm. The
authors accomplish this using a combination of reporter fusions that were designed,
using a synthetic biology approach, to respond to different sigma factors. The
promoters were tested for specificity using lacZ fusions, and then utilized in the
biofilm using a fluorescent report fusion. When the biofilm formed by strains
carrying these reporters were sectioned and imaged, the spatial (and temporal)
distribution of activity became apparent.
Comments:
For the cells where there is short range heterogeneity in expression in a similar
zone of the biofilm, can the authors rule out the fact that for some reason the
cells might have lost, or reduced the copy number of, the plasmid used to carry the
eporter fusion?
Answer: Loss of the reporter-fusion carrying plasmids is prevented by growing all
biofilms in the presence of 100 microgramm/ml ampicillin. In addition, the pSC101
origin present on the plasmid that was used here, ensures active segregation of the
ow copy number plasmid such that at least one copy of the plasmid ends up in each
daughter cell during cell division. Furthermore, the pronounced heterogeneity of
matrix production in directly adjacent cells (either the cells inside the matrix-enclosed
vertical pillars' producing matrix or the matrix-free cells outside, but right adjacent to
he pillars) in the intermediate biofilm layer can be observed in wildtype cells not
carrying any plasmids (Fig. 1).
Why does the yhijD mRNA display predominantly as a doublet band?
A: pdeH (yhjH) is expressed from a known sigma(FliA)-dependent promoter,
consistent with the observed transient accumulation of its mRNA during late log
phase/entry into stationary phase, i.e. the typical flagellar gene expression profile (as
described by Barembruch et al. 2007). Since both bands representing the pdeH
mRNA show this pattern, the existance of this doublet band is unlikely to be due to
wo promoters, but probably points to some processing of the initial pdeH transcript
which generates the shorter band and which might be a first step in mRNA turnover.
Minor editorial comments:

A: Done.

A: This would be a monstrous biofilm indeed... done.

What kind of metabolic loads do the gfp fusions impart (and how do the authors
expect the loading to modify the answer?) I imagine that this will be especially
mpactful for cells teetering between vegetative and stationary physiology.
A: As a compromise between good visualization by fluorescence microscopy and
minimization of any metabolic burden by the extra Gfp expression, the gfp reporter
usions were constructed on low-copy-number plasmids (as now also explained in
Results section 3.2; with respect to maintenance of these plasmids, see comment to
eviewer #1 above). In addition, we have observed many times that even strains
expressing the most strongly active rrnBp1::Gfp from this low-copy-number plasmid
do not show any alteration in the sS-dependent matrix architecture compared to
plasmid-free cells, i.e. Gfp expression has no impact on metabolic conditions to
which sS expression and activity are very sensitive.
am not particularly invested in a biofilm model based on self organization or
developmental program(s). In fact, I am a bit irritated by some of the loose
anguage that has been used. However, I think it is important to think about how
much of an ‘either/or’ we have between the scenario the authors see here, and the
deas implicit in self organization / development. I am not so sure that the
demarcation is as clean as the authors suggest.
A: We think when people started to think about bacterial biofilms in molecular terms,
he developmental concept was rather uncritically taken over from bacterial
sporulation, where this concept had been extraordinarily successful – bacterial
sporulation (in particular the Bacillus subtilis paradigm) perfectly shows all the
hallmarks of a developmental process, i.e. it proceeds in clear consecutive
steps/phases and involves checkpoints and committments, which can all be defined
at the molecular level for a sporulating cell, i.e. such a cell can be in state 1, 2, etc. of
sporulation. In the enthusiasm about bacterial development, it was kind of overlooked
hat with biofilm formation, we were dealing with a completely different category, i.e.
a large community of cells rather than a single cell. A physiological state, however, is
defined at the cellular level (as it relates to specific gene expression, which is a
property of a cell). To people familiar with bacterial stress responses, it became
obvious pretty soon that cells within a biofilm cannot all be in a single physiological
state, i.e. a 'biofilm state', simply because the formation of gradients (for nutrients,
oxygen, waste products, signaling compounds, etc.) is inevitable within a biofilm and,
n all likelihood, bacteria should respond to these different microenvironments...
Thus, biofilms should be rather heterogeneous with respect to gene expression. This
ed to the discovery of matrix production and composition being different in different
zones of biofilms (as shown e.g. for E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa biofilms). Differential gene expression within a biofilm of course does not
exclude that a distinct developmental process may occur within a distinct region of a
biofilm as illustrated by the key discovery that sporulation occurs in the upper regions
of the wrinkles of B. subtilis biofilms – but the entire biofilm per se cannot be the
esult of a specific developmental process.
Furthermore, self-organization of the matrix obviously occurs at the level of the
macromolecules involved, i.e. in E. coli biofilms amyloid curli fibres and pEtN
cellulose assembly into a nanocomposite while pEtN cellulose alone assembles into
ong and thick fibrils; in B. subtilis biofilms, similar assembly processes are likely to
occur with TasA fibres, exopolysaccharide and a oxygen/redox-sensitive
hydrophobin‘, etc. But again, this is not the whole story, since these macromolecular
assembly processes are embedded within the patterns of gene expression control
within the entire 3D space of biofilms that determine which matrix components are
produced in which zone of the biofilm. We fully agree that short-range self-
organization of macromolecules and this long-range control of gene expression are
not mutually exclusive and have rephrased the text to make this clearer (e.g. in the
irst few sentences of the Conclusions sections at the end of the Discussion). In fact,
he latter can also be seen as self-organization, but at a larger scale, since bacteria
n a biofilm themselves generate – by their metabolic activity – the chemical
gradients, to which they respond by differential gene expression, which includes the
expression of matrix components and therefore the building of the elaborate 3D
matrix architecture.
The observation of spatial anticorrelation between PDE PdeH and CsgD is nice.
About the physiological stratification: does the quantitative organization of
stratification (thickness of layers) make sense based on published diffusion lengths
of oxygen, nutrients, waste products? Does the level of stratification depend then
on the richness of the medium?
A: In particular, steep oxygen gradients in bacterial macrocolony biofilms have been
measured, e.g. for P. aeruginosa, where oxygen levels fall <10 % below a depth of
approximately 50 micrometer from the surface of macrocolony biofilms (reported in
several papers from L. Dietrich and coworkers that we cite in our manuscript). It
seems a striking coincidence that macrocolony biofilms of E. coli strains that produce
both curli fibres and pEtN cellulose, have a very constant thickness of approximately
65 micrometers. This is a function of pEtN cellulose, since curli-only strains unable to
make cellulose generate much thicker macrocolonies (approx. 250 micrometers
high). We think that the extreme flatness of wildtype E. coli biofilms is an adaptation
o optimize oxygen supply such that only the lowest zone becomes microaerobic
perhaps not fully anaerobic). It is interesting to note that P. aeruginosa macrocolony
biofilms can afford to become thicker (see again papers from the Dietrich group) than
E. coli macrocolonies, since P. aeruginosa has phenazines as diffusible electron
shuttles that allow to deliver electrons coming from deeper layers to oxygen in the top
ayer/surface.
We have not done experiments in which we vary the richness of the medium, but it is
obvious that colony height is not directly controlled or limited by nutrient richness,
since mutating cellulose production, allows E. coli to grow about 4fold higher biofilms
as mentioned above.
What is the emerging picture that we glean about living biofilms from these results
on cryosectioned biofilms? The authors already have comments on this topic of
course. For example, do we expect high cell motility in these lower matrix free
ayers of macrocolonies from the low c-di-GMP levels?
A: Our data show that differential transcriptome activity underlies biofilm formation in
both the spatial and temporal dimensions and we try to summarize the emerging
picture in the Discussion and in particular in the conclusions at the end of the paper.
As the focus of the paper is the relationship between spatial patterns of global gene
expression and biofilm matrix architecture, we do not further elaborate on the
previously already published and discussed) finding that flagella are massively
expressed in the lower zone of the macrocolony biofilms. Since there is also co-
egulated strong expression of the major PDE, PdeH, this zone is clearly also a low
c-di-GMP zone, i.e. these flagella should be active. Indeed, we have previously
shown that these flagella form tightly entangled networks, which depends on their
ability to rotate since with a motA mutant flagella were not entangled, but looseling
hanging around in this lower zone (Serra et al. 2013 in mBio). In the same paper we
also reported cells with strongly entangled flagella at the outer edges of a growing
macrocolony. A long time ago, Jim Shapiro (1987) reported that adding a droplet of
water to these outer colony edges allowed cells to almost immediately swim away.
We hypothesize that something similar might happen during sudden buckling of the
colony, when in principle a void space could open up below the buckling area of the
colony. However, we never find an empty space there, but this area is always filled
with cells, which actually grow very actively (they are the most elongated cells in
bottom zone of macrocolonies) (see our papers by Serra et al. 2013 and 2015). We
currently investigate such details of the buckling/folding process, but this will go into
uture publications.
These are some minor technical questions:
Figure 2B:
t is not clear how this plot is used to calculate the promoter activity described
n line 272. Also, should the tacP promoter activity be on this plot too? To show the
baseline levels as a reference?
A: We do not calculate absolute promoter activity. Actually, the more relevant
parameter is SigmaS-dependence of a promoter, since we wanted to construct two
artificial promoter which are as completely as possible either Sigma70- or SigmaS-
dependent. This is not trivial since the consensus promoters for the two forms of
RNAP holoenzyme are very similar. SigmaS-dependence is defined here as the n-
old ratio of expression in rpoS+/rpoS- strains. In the rpoS mutant, the expression of
he reporter shows Sigma70-RNAP activity alone, in the rpoS+ strain, expression
depends on both SigmaS-RNAP and Sigma70-RNAP (because there is always at
east a little overlapping activity from the two RNAP holoenzymes at any promoter).
n fact, SigmaS-dependence is at least this ratio, because in the situation where both
sigmas are present, they compete for RNAP core enzyme and the two holoenzymes
compete at the given promoter, whereas in the absence of SigmaS, Sigma70 gains
an advantage due to the absence of this competition – in other words, Sigma70-
dependent expression in the rpoS- background can be expected to be somewhat
higher than its share of expression when SigmaS is also present.
Figures 3,4:
s there some numerical quantification of the pictures to more easily see the
comparisons talked about in lines 339-343 and 348-350? It is hard to see the
comparison between fluorescence images and blot images. For example, for the
luorescence pictures, can you take the average fluorescence as a function of the
z-height? And for the blot images, the average blot intensity? I think these
suggested additions may be helpful to the reader.
A: Thank you for asking for such quantification. We have done this both for the RNA
and protein bands in Fig. 3 (now shown in the supplementary Fig. S2) as well as for
he spatial distribution of gfp activities (for csgD::gfp shown in Fig. 6, for all other
usions in the summarizing Fig. 7). The expression spectra that we now show along
with the original visual data perfectly complement the latter. Overall, both the original
visual data as well as the quantification very clearly show the succession from
stringently/sigma70-controlled ribosomal to non-stringently/sigma70-controlled to
sigmaS-controlled gene expression which is temporal along the growth curve (Fig. 3)
and spatial within the biofilm (Figs. 6 and 7).
Finally, we would like to thank the reviewers for carefully reading the
manuscript and for their insightful comments that have helped to improve this
paper!
