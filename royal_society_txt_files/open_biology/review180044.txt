This is a very interesting paper that casts light onto how centrosomal aberrations can affect the
loss of cells from an epithelial layer. This has importance to the development of cancer cells
which are long known to be influence by centrosome abnormalities.
The authors use a model system of MDCK cells over-expressing ninein-like protein that following
treatment with a DNA damaging agent will extrude cells from the epithelial structures they form
in culture. Normally cell extrusion occurs from the apical side of the cell but in this case it occurs
from the basal side. The authors document this process and show that it correlates with
alterations to microtubule organisation and the repositioning of the actomyosin ring required for
extrusion. The effect can be suppressed by an agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate / S1PR2
signalling, reminiscent of a similar response to oncogenic Ras. Overexpression of another
centrosomal protein, CEP131, gives a similar effect but in this case independently of a DNA
damaging agent. This suggests that CEP131 itself must lead to cellular damage of some sort.
The paper is quite descriptive in nature and reaches only a minimal mechanistic conclusion about
what is actually going on here. However, it has considerable value in that it carefully describes
an experimental system that could be extremely valuable in analysing this aspect of cell biology
that is of clear importance in bringing understanding of metastasis. I therefore recommend
publication in Open Biology in its present form.

This manuscript by Ganier et al. describes how the overexpression of two centrosomal proteins
(NLP and CEP131) increases the incidence of basal cell extrusion. This study is the first to report a
link between centrosome abnormalities and the directionality of cell extrusion from an epithelial
sheet. In particular, overexpression of NLP or CEP131 is shown to influence the position of the
actomyosin ring, which determines whether a cell is extruded toward apical or basal surface.
Oncogene-mediated basal cell extrusion has been shown to result from S1P downregulation, and
indeed, an agonist of SP1 re-establishes apical extrusion to NLP-overexpressing cells. Given that
NLP overexpression (and to a lesser degree that of CEP131) has been observed in cancers, and
can induce spontaneous tumourigenesis in mice, the authors suggest that the observed effects on
cell extrusion may be relevant to tumour formation.
The manuscript is clearly written and straightforward to follow. Data is of good quality and is
analysed with appropriate statistical methods.
Specific points:
1. Although the basal extrusion phenotype is compelling, the authors only observe this for dying
cells. It was previously suggested that if tumour cells get extruded basally, they can potentially
avoid anoikis, survive and initiate metastasis. Indeed, the recent EMBO paper by the same
authors demonstrated convincingly the budding of mitotic cells from the basal surface, and work
on kRas-induced basal extrusion demonstrated survival and proliferation of extruded oncogenic
cells. By contrast, here extruded cells are already apoptotic (CC3 positive) with no potential to
survive/metastasize. It would therefore be important to highlight this limitation in the abstract
and elsewhere in the manuscript.
2. I recommend including the number of events visualized in live microscopy for Fig. 3.
3. Based on Figure 4 the bias for apical extrusion seems less striking in 3D (60% vs 40%) than in
2D (70% vs 30%, Figure 1b). I appreciate that NLP expression switches these values to 40% vs
60%, but this still implies extensive utilisation of the basal cell extrusion pathway by normal
cysts. Therefore, the authors should test if CYM5520 treatment influences directionality of
extrusion in NO DOX cells.
4. Effects of NLP and CEP131 overexpression are referred to as structural centrosome
abnormalities throughout the manuscript. I preferred the term – centrosome-related bodies –
used by the authors in their previous publication (2016, Oncogene) to describe the NLP-induced
structures. Data in the current paper also suggests that structures resulting from NLP and
4
CEP131 overexpression differ in appearance and characteristics, and it is unclear how they
change the underlying centrosome structure. While I understand that the terminology –
structural centrosome aberration – is attractive, in my opinion it would be clearer if the
phenomenon was described simply as CEP131 or NLP overexpression, or the structures were
referred to as centrosome-related bodies.
5. The authors mention that they conducted a small-scale screen of centrosomal proteins to
identify ones that affect cell extrusion. It would be useful to include the candidates they tested,
even if they showed no effect.
6. I would recommend including the cartoon (currently Sup Fig 4) in the main manuscript.

Appendix A
Dear Editor, dear David
Dear Editor,
Thank you very much for the positive feed-back on our manuscript. We were very pleased
hat our manuscript has been accepted but also appreciate the opportunity for a few minor
evisions.
We appreciate the positive feed-back provided by Referee #1, who recommends publication
of our article in its original form. We are also grateful for the suggestions made by Referee
#2, whose points we have addressed as detailed below.
We trust that the revised manuscript will now be ready for publication in Open Biology. Once
again, we would like to thank you and the editorial staff for handling this manuscript.
With best regards,
Erich Nigg
Referee #2:
1. Although the basal extrusion phenotype is compelling, the authors only observe this for dying
cells. It was previously suggested that if tumour cells get extruded basally, they can potentially avoid
anoikis, survive and initiate metastasis. Indeed, the recent EMBO paper by the same authors
demonstrated convincingly the budding of mitotic cells from the basal surface, and work on kRas-
nduced basal extrusion demonstrated survival and proliferation of extruded oncogenic cells. By
contrast, here extruded cells are already apoptotic (CC3 positive) with no potential to
urvive/metastasize. It would therefore be important to highlight this limitation in the abstract and
elsewhere in the manuscript.
We agree with this point and have rewritten relevant passages in the Abstract and in the Discussion
p. 16).
2. I recommend including the number of events visualized in live microscopy for Fig. 3.
A total of six events of basal cell extrusion from distinct cysts were recorded; this is now indicated in
he legend to Figure 3a.
3. Based on Figure 4 the bias for apical extrusion seems less striking in 3D (60% vs 40%) than in
2D (70% vs 30%, Figure 1b). I appreciate that NLP expression switches these values to 40% vs 60%,
but this still implies extensive utilisation of the basal cell extrusion pathway by normal cysts.
Therefore, the authors should test if CYM5520 treatment influences directionality of extrusion in NO
DOX cells.
We agree that the proposed experiment might be informative and help decipher the mechanisms
hat promote basal extrusion of wild type cells. However, the main purpose of our study was to
dentify the process by which damaged cells harboring structural centrosome aberrations are
excluded from otherwise intact epithelia. The ability of CYM-5520 to restore the directionality of the
extrusion of the GFP-NLP+ cells allowed us to confirm that damaged cells harboring structural
centrosome aberrations are excluded from epithelia through a mechanism that closely resembles the
previously described basal cell extrusion process.
4. Effects of NLP and CEP131 overexpression are referred to as structural centrosome
abnormalities throughout the manuscript. I preferred the term – centrosome-related bodies – used by
he authors in their previous publication (2016, Oncogene) to describe the NLP-induced structures.
Data in the current paper also suggests that structures resulting from NLP and CEP131 overexpression
differ in appearance and characteristics, and it is unclear how they change the underlying centrosome
tructure. While I understand that the terminology – structural centrosome aberration – is attractive,
n my opinion it would be clearer if the phenomenon was described simply as CEP131 or NLP
overexpression, or the structures were referred to as centrosome-related bodies
We prefer to stick to the term ‘structural centrosome aberration’. Although in a previous publication
we have indeed used the term ‘centrosome-related bodies’, this term has not subsequently been
adopted in the community and we now feel that use of this term may introduce an unnecessary
complication. After all, the term ‘structural centrosome aberration’ is very ‘inclusive’, and, as we
discuss in the present paper, it compromises different types of aberrations.
5. The authors mention that they conducted a small-scale screen of centrosomal proteins to
dentify ones that affect cell extrusion. It would be useful to include the candidates they tested, even if
hey showed no effect.
This list of proteins examined is now provided in the Results section (p12).
6. I would recommend including the cartoon (currently Sup Fig 4) in the main manuscript.
We are grateful for this suggestion and now include the cartoon as a new main figure 8.
