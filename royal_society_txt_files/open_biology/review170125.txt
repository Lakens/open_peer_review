Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
This is a very thorough and scholarly review of the large and growing literature on statistical
approaches to detecting pleiotropy. The clear writing and structure of the review, combined with
the comprehensive references, would provide a very useful resource for statistical researchers in
this area. There is a very clear introduction, and useful categorisation of the problems (e.g. study
design considerations) and types of analyses (genome-wide, regional or single variant), which
makes the paper easy to follow. The discussion of pleiotropy and Mendelian randomisation is
also useful.
My comments and suggestions for possible improvement are only minor:
1. It might be useful to better explain or provide an example of how spurious pleiotropy could
occur, other than through causal variants in different genes being tagged by the same variant.
2. The distinction between “univariate” and “multivariate” could be explained better, or the more
natural distinction between methods needing summary data only or needing individual-level
information could even be used instead. When first introduced it is hard to see how these differ
(although the example of a multinomial model is given later on).
3. In 2.3 I didn’t quite understand the comment: “Individual-level genotype data are required as
input, and samples need to have phenotype values for both traits analysed. Disease traits should
have non-overlapping cases and controls.” This seems contradictory.
4. In general the paper is very successful at giving a succinct but understandable summary of
each of the large number of methods described, but for one or two of the methods this could be
improved. In particular, in the description of PRIMe, it is not clear what process is repeated
iteratively. Could this be explained better without going into too much detail?
5. Tables. Especially in Table 1, some of the references are wrong (e.g. GPA is reference 87). Please
check. Also RIVIERA-MT is mentioned in the text but not in the table.

Comments to the Author(s)
I) It might be useful to better explain or provide an example of how spurious pleiotropy could occur, other
than through causal variants in different genes being tagged by the same variant.
We have amended the last paragraph of section 1.1 as follows:
“Finally, cross-phenotype associations can also arise due to spurious pleiotropy. At the planning stage of
a study, design artefacts may lead to inaccurate results. For example, ascertainment bias or
misclassification of cases can both inflate genetic overlap estimates. At the analysis stage, causal variants
in different genes may be tagged by the same GWAS variant (Figure 1d). A classic example of this is the
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6. Due to its high gene density and extensive
linkage disequilibrium (LD), GWAS signals within the HLA region are difficult to fine map. While the HLA
locus has been associated with a range of diseases(13,15–20), most prominently immune-mediated
traits, it remains unclear to what extent these disorders share the same causal risk variants.”

II) The distinction between “univariate” and “multivariate” could be explained better, or the more natural
distinction between methods needing summary data only or needing individual-level information could
even be used instead. When first introduced it is hard to see how these differ (although the example of a
multinomial model is given later on).
This is a very helpful comment and we agree with the reviewer that at first the difference between
“univariate” and “multivariate” might not seem intuitive. We do, however, think it is important to use
these categories rather then distinguishing solely based on the type of data required, as there are
multivariate methods that require only summary data, and univariate methods that rely on individual-
level information.
We have included the following statistical explanation and hope that this clarifies these two terms:
“Univariate methods combine summary statistics of single-trait GWAS to search for cross-phenotype
effects. This means that analyses can be carried out with each trait measured on a distinct set of
individuals. Multivariate methods, on the other hand, jointly model all traits in a statistical framework,
which requires that all individuals included in the study have phenotype information for all traits
analysed. The statistical difference between uni- and multivariate methods is best illustrated by the
example of linear regression analysis: for univariate regression, the response variable (i.e. the
phenotype) will be a vector, with one data point for each individual in the study; for multivariate
regression, the response variable will be a matrix, where each row represents an individual and each
column represents one phenotype. Although there are exceptions, these categories are often analogous
to distinguishing between methods requiring only summary data and individual-level information,
respectively.”
III) In 2.3 I didn’t quite understand the comment: “Individual-level genotype data are required as input, and
samples need to have phenotype values for both traits analysed. Disease traits should have non-
overlapping cases and controls.” This seems contradictory.
We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and have amended the above sentence as follows:
“Individual-level genotype data are required as input, and samples need to have phenotype values for
both traits analysed. For disease traits, overlap between the cases and controls for each trait should be
negligible.”

IV) In general the paper is very successful at giving a succinct but understandable summary of each of the
large number of methods described, but for one or two of the methods this could be improved. In
particular, in the description of PRIMe, it is not clear what process is repeated iteratively. Could this be
explained better without going into too much detail?
We agree that this could be explained better and have added the following sentence for clarification:
“The next most strongly associated variant is then considered: if it has been already assigned as a
passenger, it is skipped; otherwise it is designated as a driver, and so on. This process is repeated
iteratively […]”
V) Tables. Especially in Table 1, some of the references are wrong (e.g. GPA is reference 87). Please check.
Also RIVIERA-MT is mentioned in the text but not in the table.
We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have corrected the tables accordingly.
