Summary:
Yi Ren et al. found that the expression levels of miR-125a-5p are low in the cancer tissue of 384
non-small cell lung cancer patients and there is a negative correlation between miR-125a-5p and
patient survival. They identified lysine methyl-transferase Suv39H1 as a target of miR-125a-5p.
Exogenous miR-125a-5p activated the expression of endogenous miR-125a-5p by reducing the
DNA methylation at its promoter region; and Suv39H1, on the other hand, suppressed the re-
activation of endogenous miR125a-5p promoter. Furthermore, they showed overexpression of
miR-125a-5p inhibited the migration and invasion of NSCLC lines and the tumorigenesis in
mouse xenograft model.
Critique:
In general, this story is well written and the data are clearly presented. However, the following
issues must be addressed.
Major issues:
1) miR-125a and miR-125b share the same seed sequence and Suv39H1 is a known target of miR-
125b (Stem Cell Reports. 2016 Jun 14; 6(6): 970–984). The authors should include Tables showing
where Suv39H1 ranks in their prediction analysis with the 3 different software tools. The authors
also need to discuss miR-125b and Suv39H1 (the paper above and others as applicable).
2) In Fig. 1A, they show that miR-125a-5p level in tumor tissue is significantly lower than that in
normal tissue. And in Table 1, they divided the patient samples to miR-125a-5p “High” and
“Low” groups. It’s surprising that most of the tumors are classified into the “High” group. The
question is, how are those two groups defined? And what’s the rationale for it?
3) The authors should include representative images for “wound healing” in Fig. 4A as well as
“tumor size” in Fig. 5 (in addition to the graphs).
Minor issues:
1) The authors should double-check their usage of grammar and typos, such as “including in
laryngeal cancer” (line 75), “and negatively associate its expression” (line 96), “the 2-
<sup><U+0394><U+0394></sup>Cq methods” (line 145) and “4 mg/mL polybrene” (line 236, should be
µg/mL).
2) Abbreviations such as “HR” in Table 2 and Table 3 should be clarified.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
miR-125a-5p has been shown to be downregulated in various types of cancer, including non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, Ren et al. analyzed 384 specimens from NSCLC
patients and confirmed downregulation of miR-125a-5p in tumor tissues, which correlated with
DNA hypermethylation of a CpG island associated with the miR-125a-5p locus. The authors also
identified the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1 as a target of miR-125a-5p. Experiments in
human NSCLC cell lines (A549 and SK-MES-1) showed that overexpression of exogenous miR-
125a-5p led to downregulation of SUV39H1, global decrease of H3K9me3 levels, loss of DNA
methylation at the miR-125a-5p locus, and increased expression of endogenous miR-125a-5p, as
well as inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and xenograft tumor growth in
NOD/SCID mice.
The study was straightforward and produced valuable information about the role of miR-125a-
5p, as well as the mechanism involved, in NSCLC. However, several issues need to be addressed:
1. The authors seem to suggest that hypermethylation of the miR-125a-5p locus is the major
underlying mechanism for miR-125a-5p downregulation. While DNA methylation, a stable
epigenetic modification, likely plays an important role in maintaining the repressed state, other
genetic and/or epigenetic events (such as HDACs as the authors mentioned) likely play more
important roles in initiating miR-125a-5p repression. Indeed, given previous work showing that
SUV39H-mediated H3K9me3 controls DNA methylation in mammalian cells (e.g. Lehnertz et al.,
Current Biology 2003), it is highly likely that DNA hypermethylation of the miR-125a-5p locus is
4
downstream of SUV39H1 upregulation (due to miR-125a-5p repression). The authors ought to
discuss these points.
2. Many of the bar graphs should be accompanied by original data. Specifically, all the bisulfite
sequencing data (Fig. 1C, 3B, 3F, 5B) and representative images for cell migration, invasion,
apoptosis (Fig. 4) and tumor growth (Fig. 5A) need to be shown. Also, growth curves and
representative images need to be included to back up the claim that miR-125a-5p overexpression
inhibits cell proliferation.
3. The primer information for bisulfite sequencing analysis of the miR-125a-5p locus must be
provided (or references should be cited). It would also be helpful to schematically show the
location of the analyzed region in the miR-125a-5p locus.
4. By convention, CpG (or CG) island, rather than GC island, should be used. In the Abstract,
islands should be island (unless more than one CG-rich region was analyzed).
5. There are other careless language errors that need to be corrected. For example, “miR-125a-5p
might be not only the potential prognostic value as a tumor biomarker but also potential
therapeutic targets in NSCLC”.

Board Member Comments to Author(s):
Two expert referees found the study interesting and worthwhile as far as it goes. As an editor I
agree with both referees that clear primary data should be provided and included in the
manuscript in support of the graphical presentations – see in particular Comment 2 of Referee 1,
and Comment 3 of Referee 2. Inclusion of all of this information is essential. Further, more detail
about the ranking of Suv39H1 in the bioinformatics analysis, as outlined in Comment 1 of Referee
2. The referees also make other important points for revision in the discussion and methods
sections.

Responses to Reviewer 1.
1. miR-125a and miR-125b share the same seed sequence and
Suv39H1 is a known target of miR-125b (Stem Cell Reports. 2016 Jun
14; 6(6): 970–984). The authors should include Tables showing
where Suv39H1 ranks in their prediction analysis with the 3 different
software tools. The authors also need to discuss miR-125b and
Suv39H1 (the paper above and others as applicable).
Response: Thanks. We have added the prediction analysis results with
the 3 different software tools as Supplemental Table 1-3. We also
updated the discussion on miR-125b, page 17, line 411-413,
highlighted as yellow.
2. In Fig. 1A, they show that miR-125a-5p level in tumor tissue is
significantly lower than that in normal tissue. And in Table 1, they
divided the patient samples to miR-125a-5p “High” and “Low”
groups. It’s surprising that most of the tumors are classified into the
“High” group. The question is, how are those two groups defined?
And what’s the rationale for it?
Response: Sorry for the missing information. As we demonstrated,
the down-regulation of miR-125a-5p might be related to the cancer
progression, thus the samples were divided into two groups, the
“High” and “Low” groups, according to their relative expression
levels of miR-125a-5p to internal control U6. We updated this part on
page 11, line 271-274 and highlighted as yellow.
3. The authors should include representative images for “wound
healing” in Fig. 4A as well as “tumor size” in Fig. 5 (in addition to
the graphs).
Response: Thanks. We have updated the Fig 4A (Supplementary
Figure 2) and Fig5 as suggested. Page 15, line 355; page 23, line
589-590; highlighted as yellow.
4. The authors should double-check their usage of grammar and
typos, such as “including in laryngeal cancer” (line 75), “and
negatively associate its expression” (line 96), “the
2-<sup><U+0394><U+0394></sup>Cq methods” (line 145) and “4 mg/mL polybrene”
(line 236, should be µg/mL).
Response: Thanks. We have corrected these sentences, line 75, 96,
145 and 241; highlighted as yellow . And the English was further
edited by native English speakers.
5. Abbreviations such as “HR” in Table 2 and Table 3 should be
clarified.
Response: Thanks. We have updated the information in Table 2 and
Table 3; highlighted as yellow.
Responses to Reviewer 2.
1. The authors seem to suggest that hypermethylation of the
miR-125a-5p locus is the major underlying mechanism for
miR-125a-5p downregulation. While DNA methylation, a stable

Response: Thanks. We have updated the discussion as suggested.
Page 17, line 405-411 and highlighted as yellow.
2. Many of the bar graphs should be accompanied by original data.
Specifically, all the bisulfite sequencing data (Fig. 1C, 3B, 3F, 5B) and
representative images for cell migration, invasion, apoptosis (Fig. 4)
and tumor growth (Fig. 5A) need to be shown. Also, growth curves
and representative images need to be included to back up the claim
that miR-125a-5p overexpression inhibits cell proliferation.
Response: Thanks for your comments again. We have updated the
bisulfite sequencing data in Supplementary Figure 1, figures for Fig4
in Supplementary Figure 2; and also Fig5A.
3. The primer information for bisulfite sequencing analysis of the
miR-125a-5p locus must be provided (or references should be cited).
It would also be helpful to schematically show the location of the
analyzed region in the miR-125a-5p locus.
Response: The primer sequences and CpG location were updated in
the Method section, page 7, line 160-164 and highlighted as yellow.
4. By convention, CpG (or CG) island, rather than GC island, should
be used. In the Abstract, islands should be island (unless more than
one CG-rich region was analyzed).
Response: Thanks. They were updated as suggested. Page 2, line 33
and highlighted as yellow.
5. There are other careless language errors that need to be
corrected. For example, “miR-125a-5p might be not only the
potential prognostic value as a tumor biomarker but also potential
therapeutic targets in NSCLC”.
Response: Thanks. We have corrected these sentences, line 45-47 and
highlighted as yellow . And the English was further edited by native
English speakers.
Appendix B
Dear Editor and Reviewers,
We highly appreciate the detailed valuable comments of the
referees on our manuscript of “Reduced miR-125a-5p level in
non-small cell lung cancer is associated with tumor progression”. The
suggestions are quite helpful for us and we incorporate them in the
revised paper.
We carefully addressed all your comments as outlined below. And
we hope the Reviewers and Editors will be satisfied with our
responses to the comments and the revisions for the original
manuscript.
Thanks and Best Regards!
Yours Sincerely,
Tao Yu
Responses to Reviewer 1.
1. The authors have properly addressed most of my concerns,
except that how they divided the patient samples to miR125a-5p
"High" and "Low" groups.
They have 384 values for miR125a-5p levels in 384 samples. The
authors should explain what is the cut-off for "High" and "Low"
groups and justify why the samples could be divided into two groups
like they did.
Response: Sorry for the missing information. We updated this part on
page 11, line 272-274 and highlighted as yellow. When we analyzed
the data we found that the expression level of miR125a-5p was either
higher or lower than the expression of internal control U6. Thus we
divided the samples to two groups, the “High” or the “Low” group.
Thanks for your suggestions again.
