Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
This is an interesting ‘hybrid’ paper, which mostly read as a review with some new datasets
added to it to show or support a concept. The experiments and datasets provided are fitting
nicely with the theories presented, which are focused on the hypothesis that aging, and age-
related disorders, can be explained in terms of protein misfolding (by damage/mistranslation)
and silent mutations (polymorphisms) sensitizing proteins to oxidation (for example by
carbonylation) creating a ‘snowballing’ phenotype. The paper is conceptually intriguing and the
authors have nicely summarized a broad field of research conducted during many years into a
coherent theory of aging.
I have but a few comments and questions the authors might want to consider:
1. The authors argue that chaperones might be exquisitely sensitive to targets for carbonylation.
This notion is actually supported by data also from embryonic stem cells (Hernebring, et al., 2006
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA), drosophila (Fredriksson et al., 2012 Aging Cell), and plants
(Johansson et al., 2004 J. Biol. Chem) and Meisner et al., (2005, Nature Genet) showed that
overproduction of a chaperone mitigates the deleterious effects of increasing mutations, which
seems to be in line with the theories presented in this paper.
2. The suggested link between ROS and TOR is interesting and I wonder if the authors could do a
similar comparison and link in bacteria, between in this case ROS/damage and the stringent
response?
3. On page 14 it is stated that the accumulation of Hsp104-containing aggregates is one of the best
described aging phenotypes. The papers cited (36, 37) might not be the most proper here as
Hsp104 accumulation at sites of carbonylated proteins in aged cells were first described by
Erjavec et al., 2007 Genes Dev. Paper 36 aimed at demonstrating that aggregates diffuse freely but
slowly which would explain asymmetrical inheritance of aggregates during cytokinesis, a notion
that was later refuted.
4. Figure 5. In this figure it is shown that rho0 mutant display an extended lifespan. There have
been reports on the opposite and also reports on no effect of a rho0 mutation. The problem is that
rho0 cells have been generated by a number of different ways and targeting different genes.
Perhaps a short comment on how their rho0 mutant was generated could help the reader here.
5. One major theme of this review/paper is that oxidation of an already misfolded protein creates
a snowballing effect that might drive the aging process. A key question that emerges is; is
oxidation really required for the phenotypic penetrance discussed or could misfolding be enough
(through aggregation for example). Perhaps the authors could mention experiments supporting
that oxidation is required or if such data is lacking how one could approach this chicken and egg
problem.

Dear Professor Radman,
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0249 entitled "Protein damage,
ageing and age-related diseases" has been accepted by the Editor for publication in Open Biology.
The reviewer has recommended publication, but also suggest some minor revisions to your
manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer's comments and revise your
manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
4
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,
