This is a nice overview of a difficult and often controversial area of science. There are just a few
points that would help to tighten up some of the generalisations. In the Intro in para two there is
a statement that a model could show that everything is understood. This only applies if that
model is unique in being the only one that fully explains everything. So far most models are not
unique. In Fig 1 the two npq mutants are not explained.
On a more general point the supramolecular architecture of a thylakoid membrane is rather
disorganised. This means that most measurements are averaged over this disorder and this could
average out key mechanistic details. This effect should be discussed.
Fig2 looks at the effects of the two proposed types of quenching. All the data presented shows
that these quenching processes follow the changes in Fl, but can they quantitatively account for
the extent of quenching seen. This point needs a fuller discussion.
The paper presents a very clear and logical flow of the argument and will be a very useful guide
for future studies.

This review summarizes the ground-breaking contributions made by this group to the
understanding of photosynthetic light harvesting and outlines remaining questions.
Conceptual comments
First paragraph of Introduction:
-The authors should consider replacing “can cause irreversible damage to photosynthetic
proteins” with a statement like “can cause inactivation of photosynthetic proteins” because it has
been shown that inactivation of D1, for example, is part of a genetic program to limit production
of reactive oxygen species under highly excessive light (see Wagner et al. 2004 Science 306, 1183–
1185) and probably should not be considered damage (Foyer et al. 2017 Viewing oxidative stress
through the lens of oxidative signalling rather than damage. Biochemical Journal 474, 877–883;
Adams et al. 2013 Photosynth Res 117, 31-44).
-NPQ is not a regulatory mechanism in the sense that it is a consequence of thermal de-excitation
rather than its mechanism. Perhaps rephrase to something like “a suite of regulatory mechanisms
that are often quantified from their effect on chlorophyll fluorescence as ‘nonphotochemical
quenching’ (NPQ).”
-the statement “(qE), turns on in seconds to minutes but turns off rather slowly over a timescale
of tens of minutes” is not correct as written. Under field conditions as well as under many
experimental conditions, the majority of the actual qE turns off within seconds (Demmig-Adams
et al. 2012 Photosynth Res 113, 75-88; Adams et al. 1999 Plant, Cell & Env 22, 125-136), and what
takes longer is reconversion of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin. In addition, zeaxanthin-free leaves
take longer to induce qE than zeaxanthin-containing leaves (Fig. 5 in Demmig-Adams et al. 1989
Plant Phys 90, 887-893).
Minor comments
-use single quotations marks (for British punctuation conventions) throughout
-give “A. thaliana” in italics
Introduction
-replace “qE is often measures” with ““qE is often measured”
-replace “plucked” with ”excised” (How was the leaf maintained? With the petiole in water?)
Spectroscopic probes…
-replace “And, What…” with “And what…”
-add the reference number after “the model developed by Zaks et al.”

Comment 1: In the Intro in para two there is a statement that a model could show that
everything is understood. This only applies if that model is unique in being the only one
that fully explains everything. So far most models are not unique.
Response: We agree with this comment and have reworded the sentence to say:
“A model capable of quantitatively predicting the influence of qE on the kinetics of the
light reactions in the presence of genetic and environmental perturbations could
subsequently be incorporated into larger scale models of photosynthesis and crop yield.”
Comment 2: In Fig 1 the two npq mutants are not explained.
Response: The data for the two mutants are not necessary for this figure and we have removed
them. Thanks.
Comment 3: On a more general point the supramolecular architecture of a thylakoid
membrane is rather disorganised. This means that most measurements are averaged over
this disorder and this could average out key mechanistic details. This effect should be
discussed.
Response: We have included a short paragraph at the end of the introduction (page 6) discussing
the role of disorder in the spectroscopic measurements.
2
Comment 4: Fig2 looks at the effects of the two proposed types of quenching. All the data
presented shows that these quenching processes follow the changes in Fl, but can they
quantitatively account for the extent of quenching seen. This point needs a fuller
discussion.
Response: We added the following paragraph at the end of the ‘Spectroscopic Probes’ section:
“It is clearly important to estimate if energy and charge transfer can account for all of qE.
However, at least two factors complicate such an estimate. First, the influence of exciton
annihilation in the snapshot transient absorption measurements needs to be accurately
modeled via a multiscale approach. Second, accurate values for the extinction
coefficients of Zea S1 and Zea•+ in vivo are required. Particularly in the latter case there is
a great deal of uncertainty about the value in part because of proton loss from the radical
(Focsan et al Archives Biochem Biophys 2015, Park et al JPCL 2017).”
Referee: 2
Conceptual comments
Comment 1: The authors should consider replacing “can cause irreversible damage to
photosynthetic proteins” with a statement like “can cause inactivation of photosynthetic
proteins” because it has been shown that inactivation of D1, for example, is part of a
genetic program to limit production of reactive oxygen species under highly excessive light
(see Wagner et al. 2004 Science 306, 1183–1185) and probably should not be considered
damage (Foyer et al. 2017 Viewing oxidative stress through the lens of oxidative signalling
rather than damage. Biochemical Journal 474, 877–883; Adams et al. 2013 Photosynth Res
117, 31-44).
Response: We thank the reviewer for suggesting this clarification. We have reworded the first
paragraph along the lines suggested. We have also added a reference to Wagner et al 2004.
Comment 2: NPQ is not a regulatory mechanism in the sense that it is a consequence of
thermal de-excitation rather than its mechanism. Perhaps rephrase to something like “a
3
suite of regulatory mechanisms that are often quantified from their effect on chlorophyll
fluorescence as ‘nonphotochemical quenching’ (NPQ).”
Response: Again we agree that the reviewer’s wording is more precise than our original text. We
have used the suggested rephrasing.
Comment 3: the statement “(qE), turns on in seconds to minutes but turns off rather slowly
over a timescale of tens of minutes” is not correct as written. Under field conditions as well
as under many experimental conditions, the majority of the actual qE turns off within
seconds (Demmig-Adams et al. 2012 Photosynth Res 113, 75-88; Adams et al. 1999 Plant,
Cell & Env 22, 125-136), and what takes longer is reconversion of zeaxanthin to
violaxanthin. In addition, zeaxanthin-free leaves take longer to induce qE than zeaxanthin-
containing leaves (Fig. 5 in Demmig-Adams et al. 1989 Plant Phys 90, 887-893).
Response: Thank you for pointing this out. We have corrected our statement about the timescales
as suggested by the reviewer and have refocused the sentence on the significance of qE in the
presence of fluctuating light.
Comment 4:
Minor comments:
-use single quotations marks (for British punctuation conventions) throughout
-give “A. thaliana” in italics
Introduction
-replace “qE is often measures” with ““qE is often measured”
-replace “plucked” with ”excised” (How was the leaf maintained? With the petiole in
water?)
Spectroscopic probes…
-replace “And, What…” with “And what…”
-add the reference number after “the model developed by Zaks et al.”

Response: We have applied all of these changes in the revised manuscript and specified that the
petiole was immersed in water during measurements.
