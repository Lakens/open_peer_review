Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
In this study, Sajiki et al take a novel approach to investigate the effects of rapamycin, a TOR
kinase inhibitor, by investigating its ability to suppress growth defects in a collection of ~1,000
temperature sensitive mutants in fission yeast (S. pombe). They identify 12 genes in this screen,
with the most abundant class being SAPK and SAPKK orthologs (Sty1/Wis1), which are involved
in responses to multiple types of stress, including nitrogen limitation. Rapamycin appears to
suppress a subset of sty1 mutant phenotypes. Metabolome analyses show that rapamycin
treatment reduces the levels of many metabolites that are up-regulated in sty1 mutants,
suggesting that overproduction of these metabolites might contribute to the poor growth of sty1
mutants.
The data appear novel, technically sound and well-controlled, although some (e.g. Figure 3A-D,
G and H) would benefit from statistical analyses or other indications of reproducibility. The data
lead to a reasonable hypothesis but stop short of testing it in a meaningful way. In this sense, the
manuscript seems unfinished, or more in the category of a screen report. The screen data are
interesting and will likely be illuminating upon further investigations, perhaps by carrying out
more extensive metabolomics analyses of SAPK and TORC mutants, separately or in
combination, under stress conditions. Such data could significantly elevate the impact of this
manuscript.

In this paper, Sajiki et al. used a cleverly designed genetic screening strategy to explore the
physiological effects of rapamycin, and successfully identified genes whose loss of function can
be compensated by rapamycin treatment. These genetic findings, together with metabolomic
analysis results, provide useful new clues on understanding the modes of action of rapamycin.
I have a number of minor suggestions for the authors to consider.
Title,
“SAPK signal” perhaps should be changed to “SAPK signaling”
Page 4, line 68
“rapamycin’s temperature-rescue capability against our ts mutant library,”
“temperature-rescue” does not sound right. I think it is perhaps better to say “the capability of
rapamycin to rescue mutants in our ts mutant library,”
Page 4, line 69
“We identified 12 defective genes, the ts sensitivity of which is rescued by rapamycin”
I think it is better to say ““Mutants defective in 12 genes were found to be rescued by rapamycin”
Page 4, line 88
“Rapamycin rescued ts phenotypes of mutations in 12 genes”
Because the ts strains are derived from random mutagenesis, it is likely that there are many other
mutations in the ts strains besides the one causing the ts phenotype. 7 of the 12 genes are
represented by a single strain. For these 7 strains, I think it remains possible that the rescuing
effect of rapamycin is influenced by other mutations in the background and only independently
generated strains can rule out this possibility. The authors should discuss this possibility.
Page 5, line 93
“These genes are central to stress the responsive signaling pathway” should be “These genes are
central to the stress responsive signaling pathway”
Page 5, line 94
“Mutations in all sty1 and wis1 strains were located in or near their protein kinase domains
(Table S1).”
4
It should be mentioned that some of the sty1 and wis1 mutations are nonsense mutations that
truncate the proteins.
Page 5, line 107
“one extocytic Rab-type GTPase gene (ypt2)” should be “one exocytic Rab-type GTPase gene
(ypt2)”
Page 6, line 124
“Interestingly, at 36oC,rapamycin addition also accelerated cell division in WT (~1.16-fold
increase in 6h) (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that SAPK may function synergistically with
rapamycin.”
I don’t think this is a meaningful conclusion. Other rapamycin-rescued ts mutants also have
reduced growth rate at 36 degree, and by the same logic, the corresponding genes can all be
thought as “acting synergistically with rapamycin”. I guess the data simply indicate that a
growth-rate-limiting process in WT cells at 36 degree is enhanced by rapamycin. That process
may or may not be related to the 12 genes identified in this paper.
Page 7, line 161
“in <U+2206>sty1, the trehalose level was already high before rapamycin addition (Fig. 4D), implying that
Sty1 is required for a stress response to the temperature shift.”
All 4 samples were collected at 36 degree, and thus no conclusion can be made on temperature
shift.
Page 11, line 260
“Background mutations were eliminated and mutations common to all plasmids”
“all plasmids” does not make sense. I think it should be “all ts- segregants”.

Thank you for very constructive comments. As you pointed out, this paper showed our
initial findings based on a mutant screening, although this initial stage took us five
years. We were inspired by the previous report in Open Biology (Ikai et al., 2011),
showed Cut1 and Cut2 ts mutants were rescued by rapamycin, and would like to screen
other ts mutants comprehensively. In future, we would like to challenge and pursue
deeper and larger scope questions about complex regulations between SAPK and TORC
as you commented us by spending enough time for next few years. Thank you very
much. At this moment, we added such our future intention in discussion as “these are
just our initial findings for complex regulation between SAPK and TORC, and we
would like to continue more detailed metabolome analyses in future to reveal the
mechanisms.” Thank you also for pointing out the reproducibility in Fig 3A-D, G and
H. We added error bars showing standard deviations of repeated experiments for these
figures.

Thank you very much for reviewing our manuscript very thoroughly. We greatly

Title,

We changed it according to the suggestion.

“rapamycin’s temperature-rescue capability against our ts mutant library,”
“temperature-rescue” does not sound right. I think it is perhaps better to say “the
capability of rapamycin to rescue mutants in our ts mutant library,”
We changed it according to the suggestion.
Page 4, line 69
“We identified 12 defective genes, the ts sensitivity of which is rescued by rapamycin”
I think it is better to say ““Mutants defective in 12 genes were found to be rescued by
rapamycin”
We changed it according to the suggestion.
Page 4, line 88
“Rapamycin rescued ts phenotypes of mutations in 12 genes”
Because the ts strains are derived from random mutagenesis, it is likely that there are
many other mutations in the ts strains besides the one causing the ts phenotype. 7 of the
12 genes are represented by a single strain. For these 7 strains, I think it remains
possible that the rescuing effect of rapamycin is influenced by other mutations in the
background and only independently generated strains can rule out this possibility. The
authors should discuss this possibility.
For these identified mutants, plasmids containing WT genes for other background
mutations could not rescue ts phenotype, that means the genes identified here are the
sole responsible genes. Since rapamycin rescued the ts phenotype, we concluded that
the responsible genes should be affected by rapamycin.
There were some strains in which background mutations might cause rapamycin
rescues, but we removed all such cases as undetermined (---) in Fig 2A.
We added the following sentence in line 89, “they must be sole responsible genes for
each strain, since plasmids containing WT genes for other background mutations could
not rescued the ts phenotype.”
Page 5, line 93
“These genes are central to stress the responsive signaling pathway” should be “These
genes are central to the stress responsive signaling pathway”
We changed it according to the suggestion.
Page 5, line 94
“Mutations in all sty1 and wis1 strains were located in or near their protein kinase
domains (Table S1).”
It should be mentioned that some of the sty1 and wis1 mutations are nonsense mutations
that truncate the proteins.
We changed it to “Mutations in all sty1 and wis1 strains with amino acid substitutions
were located in or near their protein kinase domains, and all with nonsense mutations
(sty1-791, wis1-887, sty1-989) lacked the C-terminal half of the kinase domains”.
Page 5, line 107
“one extocytic Rab-type GTPase gene (ypt2)” should be “one exocytic Rab-type
GTPase gene (ypt2)”
We changed it according to the suggestion.
Page 6, line 124
“Interestingly, at 36oC,rapamycin addition also accelerated cell division in WT (~1.16-
fold increase in 6h) (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that SAPK may function

I don’t think this is a meaningful conclusion. Other rapamycin-rescued ts mutants also
have reduced growth rate at 36 degree, and by the same logic, the corresponding genes
can all be thought as “acting synergistically with rapamycin”. I guess the data simply
indicate that a growth-rate-limiting process in WT cells at 36 degree is enhanced by
rapamycin. That process may or may not be related to the 12 genes identified in this
paper.
We appreciate for the very valuable comment. Since the sentences were confusing, we
deleted those.

response before adding rapamycin.”
