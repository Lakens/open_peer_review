The title of this review suggests a broad overview of the molecular mechanisms of the major
forms of axonal degeneration with a special focus on different species and diseases. However, in
the present manuscript only Wallerian degeneration (WD) is discussed in detail while other
forms of axonal degeneration are not introduced. WD is not put in a broader context. Moreover,
the role of axonal degeneration (or WD in particular) in disease is described very incompletely on
only 1 page.
Therefore either the title should be adjusted to e.g. "Axon death signalling in Wallerian
degeneration among different species" or the manuscript should be significantly expanded to
include other forms of axonal degeneration with the respective molecular mechanisms and a
much broader and more thorough discussion about the role of axonal degeneration in disease.
WD is only one form of axonal degeneration (others including acute axonal degeneration, dying
back axonal degeneration, focal axonal degeneration, retraction, pruning etc.). This should be
made very clear and either the other forms of axonal degeneration should be discussed in detail
or the article should be merely focussed on WD.
WD affects only the distal part of the axon after a lesion but not the remaining proximal part that
is still connected to the soma. In many cases, especially after neurotrauma, it is a necessary
prerequisite for later axonal regeneration that the distal part of the degenerating axon is cleared.
It is therefore rather the remaining proximal axon stump that should be stabilised as it is still
connected to the soma and might be the origin of axonal regeneration. WD in this case is a
necessary physiological process that should not be inhibited.
In line with this view, several studies have shown that Wld-S counteracts and significantly delays
axonal regeneration. These studies should also be discussed here (e.g. overview/perspective:
Tang, Cells 2019 “Why is NMNAT Protective against Neuronal Cell Death and Axon
Degeneration, but Inhibitory of Axon Regeneration?” and many others).
Autophagy has been described as an important pathophysiological mediator of WD and should
thus be discussed in the review (e.g. Wang et al., Sci Adv 2019 "Rapid depletion of ESCRT protein
Vps4 underlies injury-induced autophagic impediment and Wallerian"; Wakatsuki et al., JCB
2017 “GSK3B-mediated phosphorylation of MCL1 regulates axonal autophagy to promote
Wallerian degeneration”).
For the discussion of calcium as a “death mediator”, the following studies should be cited as they
have nicely proven the mechanism in mammals in vivo: Kerschensteiner et al., Nat Med 2005 “In
3
vivo imaging of axonal degeneration and regeneration in the injured spinal cord.” and Knöferle
et al., PNAS 2010 “Mechanisms of acute axonal degeneration in the optic nerve in vivo”.
The involvement of calpain in axonal degeneration has also been demonstrated in mammals in
vivo and here CRMP2 could be identified as a major downstream target: Zhang et al., Sci Rep
2016 “Calpain-mediated cleavage of collapsin response mediator protein-2 drives acute axonal
degeneration”. This should be included.
If the authors really wish to discuss the role of WD in neurological diseases, this part needs to be
substantially expanded. Also negative results of therapeutic interventions in WD should be
discussed, e.g. the negative effects on axonal regeneration and negative results in MS models (e.g.
Singh et al., 2017 “Relationship of acute axonal damage, Wallerian degeneration, and clinical
disability in multiple sclerosis”). Also differential effects on axon and soma should be taken into
account (e.g. Beirowski Eur J Nsc 2008 “The WldS gene delays axonal but not somatic
degeneration in a rat glaucoma model“).
Figure 1 does not include the events of acute axonal degeneration and of possible dying back
axonal degeneration of the proximal axon. This should at least be mentioned in the legend. Also
autophagy as a major player in axonal degeneration and clearing of axons should be included in
the figure. It would be desirable to include NMNAT as the major molecular player in WD in the
figure.

Point-by-point response to the reviewer's comments (manuscript RSOB-19-0118)
We would like to thank the reviewer for comments, suggestions and concerns. Below, we will respond
point-by-point to each comment raised by the reviewer. In the manuscript as well as in this document,
changes are highlighted in red. In this document, the grey text serves as help for orientation.
Comments to the Author(s)
The title of this review suggests a broad overview of the molecular mechanisms of the major forms of
axonal degeneration with a special focus on different species and diseases. However, in the present
manuscript only Wallerian degeneration (WD) is discussed in detail while other forms of axonal
degeneration are not introduced. WD is not put in a broader context. Moreover, the role of axonal
degeneration (or WD in particular) in disease is described very incompletely on only 1 page. Therefore
either the title should be adjusted to e.g. "Axon death signalling in Wallerian degeneration among
different species" or the manuscript should be significantly expanded to include other forms of axonal
degeneration with the respective molecular mechanisms and a much broader and more thorough
discussion about the role of axonal degeneration in disease.
The focus of this review lies in axon death signaling in Wallerian degeneration (WD). In the first part of
the manuscript, we defined WD as a two-step process consisting of axon death and glial clearance. As
the reviewer correctly indicated, we specifically discuss axon death in WD, while other forms of axon
degeneration weren’t in the main focus of this review. We therefore adjusted the title to:
Axon death signaling in Wallerian degeneration among species and in disease
We would like to keep “disease” in the title, for the following two reasons:
1) WldS serves as a golden standard in the field of WD. Since its discovery, WldS has been thoroughly
used in a broad range of models with neurological conditions (C. elegans, Drosophila and mouse). If
axon degeneration occurs in the absence of injury, and can be blocked by over-expression of WldS,
they undergo Wallerian-like degeneration. A beneficial outcome mediated by over-expression of WldS
ed to the conclusion that the signaling pathway of WD (axon death) might be engaged in those axons.
An important aspect of WldS is dosage. The stronger it is over-expressed, the better it protects, which
suggests that levels of WldS dictate whether there might be a beneficial outcome. To date, multiple
reviews have already discussed how attenuated axon death signaling in WD (that is, over-expression
of WldS) might be beneficial in axons in a broad range of diseased and injured nervous systems, and
we included (Conforti et al. 2014, Nature Neuroscience) in the chapter “6. Axon death signaling in
disease”. This was the main reason for us to emphasize in the manuscript that WldS will not be covered
as representative of the WD signaling pathway in disease.
2) Since the discovery of dSarm/Sarm1 in 2012, several labs started to investigate the role of Sarm1 in
the diseased and injured nervous system. Contrary to the gain-of-function situation in WldS, loss of
dSarm/Sarm1 has a much more potent attenuation phenotype than WldS (Gilley et al., 2017, Cell
Reports). This is why we focused on Sarm1, which, as indicated above, offers 1 page of insights into
the diseased and injured nervous system in our review. Importantly, we also emphasize that Sarm1-/-
knockout mice are not protected in a model of ALS (SOD1 G93A), while WldS offers modest extension
of life span. Given that Nmnat/Nmnat2 (WldS) controls dSarm/Sarm1 activation, this is unexpected. And
t shows that over-expression of WldS might do something to axons which is unrelated to axon death
signaling in WD.
We therefore believe that WldS should not be the sole reference for axon death signaling in WD. For
this reason, we mainly focused on Sarm1 in mouse models of neurological conditions.
WD is only one form of axonal degeneration (others including acute axonal degeneration, dying back
axonal degeneration, focal axonal degeneration, retraction, pruning etc.). This should be made very
clear and either the other forms of axonal degeneration should be discussed in detail or the article
should be merely focused on WD.
We added a new section which clarifies that among the different forms of axon degeneration, we will
focus on axon death signaling in WD:
To date, distinct morphological modes of axon degeneration have been observed and underlying
molecular mechanisms described [10]. Among them are dying back axon degeneration, retraction,
axosome shedding, focal axonal degeneration induced by growth factor withdrawal and pruning, to
name a few. Axon degeneration can also be triggered through axonal injury (axotomy), which is
probably one of the simplest models to study how axons execute their own destruction. Identified by
and named after Augustus Waller, Wallerian degeneration (WD) is…
…
Over recent years, significant advancements broadened our understanding of axon death signaling
in WD.
WD affects only the distal part of the axon after a lesion but not the remaining proximal part that is still
connected to the soma. In many cases, especially after neurotrauma, it is a necessary prerequisite for
ater axonal regeneration that the distal part of the degenerating axon is cleared. It is therefore rather
the remaining proximal axon stump that should be stabilised as it is still connected to the soma and
might be the origin of axonal regeneration. WD in this case is a necessary physiological process that
should not be inhibited.
In line with this view, several studies have shown that Wld-S counteracts and significantly delays axonal
regeneration. These studies should also be discussed here (e.g. overview/perspective: Tang, Cells
2019 “Why is NMNAT Protective against Neuronal Cell Death and Axon Degeneration, but Inhibitory of
Axon Regeneration?” and many others).
We are aware of the overview/perspective mentioned by the reviewer (Tang, Cells 2019) and other
related reviews. In this particular review/perspective, there are multiple studies covered that show how
the proximal axon (connected to the soma) induces stress-responses, and ultimately engages axon
regeneration. We are also aware that attenuated axon death signaling harbors inhibitory features
required for axons to regenerate. However, we believe that axon regeneration would be a topic for a
separate review. We therefore avoided discussing the proximal axon (e.g. axon regeneration), and
focused specifically on the distal from the soma separated axon (e.g. axon degeneration).
Moreover, the message of this review is not to suggest that WD, as a necessary physiological process,
should be inhibited after injury in the distal, from the soma separated axon. Rather, it provides an
overview of essential genes required for axon death signaling in WD.
Autophagy has been described as an important pathophysiological mediator of WD and should thus be
discussed in the review (e.g. Wang et al., Sci Adv 2019 "Rapid depletion of ESCRT protein Vps4
underlies injury-induced autophagic impediment and Wallerian"; Wakatsuki et al., JCB 2017 “GSK3B-
mediated phosphorylation of MCL1 regulates axonal autophagy to promote Wallerian degeneration”).
We agree with the reviewer’s comment. In fact, some work was already mentioned and cited under
chapter “4.8. Other mediators”. We significantly expanded this paragraph which now reads as follows:
So far, axon death mediators were discussed whose modification results in a robust attenuation. Yet
also other modifications have been reported that are capable to delay axon death, such as the
mitochondrial permeability transition [31], recycling endosomes [98], autophagy [99,100], sodium
and potassium currents [50], the ubiquitin ligase ZNRF-1 [101], the microtubule destabilization
mediated by CRMP2 [102,103] and the transcription factor Pebbled/RREB1 [104]. The precise
interaction of these mediators with the signaling cascade remains to be determined, either due to
tissue specific phenotypes or the involvement of whole organelles.
For the discussion of calcium as a “death mediator”, the following studies should be cited as they have
nicely proven the mechanism in mammals in vivo: Kerschensteiner et al., Nat Med 2005 “In vivo imaging
of axonal degeneration and regeneration in the injured spinal cord.” and Knöferle et al., PNAS 2010
“Mechanisms of acute axonal degeneration in the optic nerve in vivo”.
We added both references under chapter “4.1. Ca2+”:
As mentioned above, a local initial influx of Ca2+ right after axotomy from the site of injury is observed
both in invertebrate and vertebrate models in vivo and in vitro [24,27,50,51]. The first, rapid short-
term Ca2+ wave precedes the lag phase (Figure 2). The disassembly of severed axons is initiated
by high extra-axonal Ca2+ concentrations: if the extracellular environment is devoid of Ca2+ (by
adding EGTA, or in a medium lacking Ca2+), or when voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are inhibited, the
fragmentation of severed axons is significantly delayed (Figure 3A) [26,50,52–54].
The involvement of calpain in axonal degeneration has also been demonstrated in mammals in vivo
and here CRMP2 could be identified as a major downstream target: Zhang et al., Sci Rep 2016
“Calpain-mediated cleavage of collapsin response mediator protein-2 drives acute axonal
degeneration”. This should be included.
As mentioned above, we significantly expanded the chapter “4.8. Other mediators”. One CRMP2
reference was already included in our manuscript (Kinoshita et al., 2019), we now added a second
reference (Zhang et al., 2016), both of which are highlighting CRMP2:
So far, axon death mediators were discussed whose modification results in a robust attenuation. Yet
also other modifications have been reported that are capable to delay axon death, such as the
mitochondrial permeability transition [31], recycling endosomes [98], autophagy [99,100], sodium
and potassium currents [50], the ubiquitin ligase ZNRF-1 [101], microtubule destabilization mediated
by CRMP2 [102,103] and the transcription factor Pebbled/RREB1 [104]. The precise interaction of
these mediators with the signaling cascade remains to be determined, either due to tissue specific
phenotypes or the involvement of whole organelles.
If the authors really wish to discuss the role of WD in neurological diseases, this part needs to be
substantially expanded. Also negative results of therapeutic interventions in WD should be discussed,
e.g. the negative effects on axonal regeneration and negative results in MS models (e.g. Singh et al.,
2017 “Relationship of acute axonal damage, Wallerian degeneration, and clinical disability in multiple
sclerosis”). Also differential effects on axon and soma should be taken into account (e.g. Beirowski Eur
J Nsc 2008 “The WldS gene delays axonal but not somatic degeneration in a rat glaucoma model“).
We appreciate the above comments raised by the reviewer. One concerns WD in neurological diseases,
the other one the effects in axons vs. soma.
Regarding WD in disease: as mentioned above, WldS has been thoroughly tested in a broad range of
models with neurological conditions with different outcomes, which is covered in several reviews. WldS
(or Nmnat2) regulates the activation of Sarm1 as an executioner of axon death signaling in WD. Axon
death can therefore be attenuated by over-expression of WldS (which depends on dosage), or lack of
Sarm1. Sarm1-/- knockout mice circumvent dosage issues. Therefore, we wanted to summarize the role
of Sarm1 as a pro-axon death gene in disease models. Sarm1 has only been recently investigated in
disease models, and therefore only a few studies are available. Most, if not all, are covered in one page
n the chapter “6. Axon death signaling in disease”. Importantly, we also included negative results (e.g.
Sarm1 in an ALS mouse model).
Regarding axon vs. soma: JNK signaling, Sarm1 and other axon death genes have been implicated in
stress response in the soma of the neuron after injury (Wang et al., 2018, Cell Reports). However, as
ndicated above, the goal of this review is to focus on the distal axon, and not on the proximal axon or
the soma itself, which could be covered in a separate review.
Figure 1 does not include the events of acute axonal degeneration and of possible dying back axonal
degeneration of the proximal axon. This should at least be mentioned in the legend. Also autophagy as
a major player in axonal degeneration and clearing of axons should be included in the figure. It would
be desirable to include NMNAT as the major molecular player in WD in the figure.
As mentioned above, in this review, we would like to focus on the distal, from the soma separated axon.
Therefore, we avoided the proximal axon, including the discussion of a possible dying back mechanism
after injury.
Moreover, rather than focusing on specific molecules or programs in Figure 1 (e.g. Nmnat/Nmnat2 or
autophagy, respectively), we wanted to provide a broad overview about WD, that is the axonal intrinsic
axon death signaling cascade, and the glial extrinsic clearance machinery. Furthermore,
Nmnat/Nmant2 is discussed in details later in the manuscript, and indicated in Figure 3.
Additional changes:
1. We would like to brief both the editor and the reviewer that some minor changes were added to the
manuscript (highlighted in red), e.g. educt is changed to substrate, among is changed to between, etc.
2. We also changed two citations from bioRxiv to pubmed references:
Mutations in human Nmnat2 have been linked to Fetal Akinesia Deformation Sequence (FADS), and
to childhood onset polyneuropathy and erythromelalgia [110,111].
3. In addition, we now included two minor updates.
- The first update includes an active role of glia in axonal fragmentation:
During the execution phase, surrounding glial cells and specialized phagocytes not only clear the
resulting axonal debris by activating multiple signaling pathways [19,36–39], but also actively
enhance axonal fragmentation [40]. To date, several key questions remain unresolved, such as what
kind of axonal “eat-me” signals are presented to surrounding glia [41], and where within the
execution phase glial cells engage to clear axonal debris.
Once the execution phase is over, e.g. when the injured axon is disassembled and the resulting
debris cleared by surrounding glia, WD is also over. While WD occurs both in the central and
peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS, respectively), it is of particular importance in the PNS to
pave the way for the proximal axon still attached to the neuronal soma, which ultimately activates
its regenerative program, to regrow and thereby to re-establish circuit function [33].
- The second update includes the role of NMN in Sarm1 activation:
Nmnat proteins efficiently synthesize NAD+ from NMN, thus a raise in NMN automatically results in
a raise of NAD+ [58,73]. Interestingly, high levels of a cell-permeable analogue of NMN (which
cannot be used as substrate for Nmnat-mediated NAD+ synthesis) are sufficient to activate Sarm1
in cultured neurons, thereby depleting NAD+, which results in non-apoptotic cell death. Whether this
is also true in severed axons remains to be determined [109].
4. Following the author guidelines available on the royal society webpage, we changed the format of
the bibliography from Vancouver to Open Biology style. This format change did not affect the content
from the original manuscript.
