The manuscript by Monda and Cheeseman reports the dramatic relocalization of cytoplasmic
dynein and dynein-associated proteins after treatment of mitotic cells with small molecule
inhibitors of ubqiuitination enzymes. The data showing dynein relocalization are convincing and
the effects of the drugs are obvious. The manuscript is a bit confusing though, as the authors go
on to discover that the effects of two ubqiuitination inhibitors used are possibly not specific to the
ubiquitin pathway. Nonetheless, the authors have shown a dramatic effect of dynein
reclocalization within relatively fast time scales during mitosis, demonstrating that dynein
localization is sensitive and dynamic during this process. I think this finding makes the paper
interesting for cell biologists in general, but have several concerns to be addressed before the
paper is suitable for publication.
Major concern:
Almost all of the figures are non-quantitative, showing only examples of cell phenotypes. The
authors should do a better job of quantifying the different of phenotypes they observe. For
example, this should include the percentage of cells that show abnormal phenotypes (all figs).
More importantly the authors should come up with a quantitative strategy to measure the protein
relocalization they observe in response to their drug treatments. Example linescans drawn
through the spindle poles, coupled with statistical analysis of fluorescence intensity and
reporting of the percentage of cells that display a given phenotype would be a good start.
Minor points:
1. Is there really no accumulation of GFP-NudEL at spindle poles in prometaphase (Fig. 2D)?
2. In addition to drug treatments, the authors also use a temp. sensitive cell line to probe the role
of Uba1 in dynein relocalization. Confirmation of this result using RNAi against Uba1 would be
nice.
3. Fig. 5C, how do the authors qualify what counts as “strong” DHC signal on spindle poles? The
methods do not make this very clear. Again, a more quantitative approach would be useful here.
4. The authors use the term “dynein adapters” to describe non-subunit dynien interacting
proteins. The term “adapter” has been more recently used to describe molecules that specifically
link dynien to dynactin and cargos (see recent review by Reck-Peterson and Carter). The
molecules described here by the authors do not meet this more current definition, and I suggest
using a different term here for clarity. Perhaps “dynein interactors” or “dynein effectors” would
be more appropriate.

5. The title is perhaps a bit misleading. While technically accurate, the authors do conclude that
the effects of the small molecules may not be on-target.

Monda and Cheeseman investigate the role of the ubiquitin system on dynein regulation &
localisation in mitosis using a pharmacological approach. This approach provides some
interesting findings regarding the dynamic control of dynein, The authors are cautious in the
interpretation of their data and are careful to mention possible off target effects and other
explanation for their observations. While I understand the authors caution, I would have liked to
see some more discussion of the potential targets for ubiquitination, for example what is known
about dynein subunit modification from previous work. There are studies on dynein subunit
modification during cilium disassembly, targeting of the dynein interaction NuMa by the BRISC
Dub complex and ubiquitination linked to spindle positioning that could be briefly discussed in
this context.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_3
In this manuscript, the authors aim to probe the dynamic nature of dynein localization during
mitosis in response to a specific post-translational modification – Ubiquitination. They find that
dynein rapidly accumulates at the mitotic spindle poles following treatment with a subset of
inhibitors that target the ubiquitination system in a manner that is not dependent on protein
degradation. This accumulation at the spindle poles can be reversed by treatment with an
inhibitor of deubiquitinase. Further a subset of dynein adaptors, which included ZW10 and Lis1
was found to replicate this localization behavior of the dynein heavy chain in response to the
same drug treatment. I am a bit underwhelmed by the amount of data presented in the study in
support of their observations apart from the fact that there is no mechanistic information that is
derived from them. Over all, even though it is not clear to me what the rationale of the authors
were in carrying out these experiments, I still feel that the observations are moderately interesting
and could be useful to the field if the authors can provide additional data to complete the study
as mentioned in the points below:
(i) In Fig. 1, please quantify what % of mitotic cells showing spindle disassembly phenotype in
response to NSC697923? I gather than only spindles that maintained bipolarity was selected for
the dynein pole localization analysis. Are the HeLa cell stably expressing DHC-GFP? Please
mention these details in the results and legends section and not just in the methods for the ease of
the readers.
(ii) Other than Phosphosite plus (ref# 4), is there any direct evidence for ubiquitination of dynein
5
heavy chain being important for its many cellular functions? A quick pubmed search returned
one publication for ubiquitination of the p150glued subunit of dynactin (Zhang et al., BBRC,
2007) and one for dynein intermediate chain (Thom et al., Developmental Cell, 2014) . But I could
not find any evidence for dynein HC. Please comment. Also, it would be good to include these or
any other relevant references that you might find.
(iii) As mentioned by the authors in the discussion, the result is very similar to the ATP depletion
experiments using Azide and Deoxyglucose. Is there a way to test if the treatment with any of
these drugs is in fact causing the ATP levels to drop creating a situation similar to that of
Az/DOG treatment? Also, would it be possible for the authors to test the phosphorylation status
of the dynein being accumulated at the spindle poles? As dephosphorylated dynein tends to
associate strongly to dynactin at the spindle poles, maybe ubiquitination promotes a similar
behavior with regard to dynactin-binding, which could be tested.
(iv) The localization is interestingly on the inner side of the spindle pole on the side away from
the cortex. Is that always the case? I was wondering what the authors thought about this and if so
why this would be the case. I would like to see a centrosome marker staining as a part of the
initial characterization of this interesting distribution pattern.
(v) I am very keen to see the behavior of Mad1/Mad2 and Bub1/BubR1 after NSC697923 or PYR-
41 treatment in either prometaphase cells or in metaphase cells with Taxol (if there are no
metaphase cells to image without Taxol treatment). Also Lis1 does not seem to be accumulating
at poles that much in Taxol-treated metaphase cells, contrary to the claim of the authors.
(vi) Do the authors see the same pole accumulation with dynactin and/or Spindly? Also are the
localization of any bonafide spindle pole components like <U+03B3>-tubulin, pericentrin, NUMA, etc,
altered in response to these drug treatments? As interesting as the observations made in this
study is, I feel that the experiments mentioned here and in point (iv) are essential for a
comprehensive study and lend more validity to the observations made here.
(vii) I wonder why the authors switch between GFP-ZW10 and anti-ZW10 antibody staining in
Fig. 2 and the rest of the other figures. If they want to compare the lack of accumulation in Fig. 3
to that of accumulation in Fig. 2, then I feel that they should use the same approach. Considering,
that the ZW10 antibody worked well in their experiments in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, it might be best to
just stick with that detection method instead of using GFP-ZW10 cell line.
(viii) This point is mostly a comment. The results in Fig. 4 suggest that the effect could be
produced by off-target effects and the authors themselves provide evidence in support of this
possibility. All this leaves me a bit confused and wanting to know how this off-target effect is
produced? Both these drugs are known to produce off-target effects and there are many spindle
pole components that might respond to the ubiquitination/deubquitination system. The study
would be more impactful if there was any idea as to what causes this pole accumulation of
dynein considering that TAK-243 does not cause this accumulation. Does TAK-243 cause spindle
defects similar to that of NSC697923 and PYR-41 and are chromosome mis-alignments observed
in those cells?
Minor points:
(i) Have the authors tried live imaging of DHC accumulation after NSC697923 treatment similar
to what they did with PYR-41 treatment and if so and do they find the same/similar kinetics of
pole accumulation? This point is not clear from the text currently even though it is mentioned
that the spindles start getting disassembled after 15 mins of NSC697923 treatment.
6
(ii) Since Nde1 was called NudE initially, it might be worth mentioning this as an alternative
name in the introduction as I still see both names being used interchangeably.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_7
I still harbor concerns about the lack of quantitative presentation of the author’s data. I think the
authors should adequately address these concerns before the paper is published.
1. I am still not happy with the author’s response about quantification of phenotypes they report.
As scientists, I think it is important for us to report results as accurately as possible. Therefore, the
authors should include precise quantifications of their phenotypes. For instance, citing
“approximately 20% of cells (line 86)” and “almost 80% of cells (line 96)” should be replaced with
actual numbers, with errors, calculated from the data. In addition, the authors should provide the
number of cells quantified for each phenotype they report. Similar statistics should be presented
for ALL figures in the paper, as I only find them for Fig. 1 in the current version. For instance, I
have no idea if ZW10 accumulated at the spindle poles in 1% or 99% of cells treated with
NSC697923 in Fig. 3B, and so on for all reported phenotypes. The interpretation of these effects is
greatly affected by these statistics, and I feel that these numbers must be disclosed to the reader in
order to allow them to make a scientific judgment about the data.
The authors argue in their response that a quantitative measure of their spindle pole
accumulation phenotype does not adequately capture the phenotype in their opinion.
Nonetheless, one cannot argue with math. The authors should either report the numbers and
make their argument about the quantification methodology in the results and methods sections,
or come up with another method of quantification that more adequately captures the phenotype
in their opinion. Avoiding quantification because it doesn’t look the same as “by eye” is not
scientifically rigorous in my opinion.
2. The author’s response to my previous point #4 does not adequately answer my question. The
author’s do not provide a quantitative, unbiased methodology for how they qualify what counts
as “bright foci” of dynein at spindle poles. I see the difference in the example they provide, but
11
the methodology is critical for any researcher wishing to follow up on this study.

The authors have satisfactorily responded to most of my queries but a couple of issues remain:
(i) I am ok with the authors using Arp1 staining for dynactin and NuMA and CSAP staining (not
gamma-tubulin, or pericetrin as requested) to mark the centrosomes/centrioles. But I strongly
feel that they should also test for Spindly, which is one of the bonafide adaptors for dynein, in
their experiments.
(ii) I was hoping that the authors would discuss more about what the off-target effects of the
different drugs used are likely to be in the context of the observed effects, but that discussion is
still missing in their response or in the manuscript.

I still harbor concerns about the lack of quantitative presentation of the author’s data. I think the
authors should adequately address these concerns before the paper is published.
1. I am still not happy with the author’s response about quantification of phenotypes they report.
As scientists, I think it is important for us to report results as accurately as possible. Therefore, the
authors should include precise quantifications of their phenotypes. For instance, citing
“approximately 20% of cells (line 86)” and “almost 80% of cells (line 96)” should be replaced with
actual numbers, with errors, calculated from the data. In addition, the authors should provide the
number of cells quantified for each phenotype they report. Similar statistics should be presented
for ALL figures in the paper, as I only find them for Fig. 1 in the current version. For instance, I
have no idea if ZW10 accumulated at the spindle poles in 1% or 99% of cells treated with
NSC697923 in Fig. 3B, and so on for all reported phenotypes. The interpretation of these effects is
greatly affected by these statistics, and I feel that these numbers must be disclosed to the reader in
order to allow them to make a scientific judgment about the data.
The authors argue in their response that a quantitative measure of their spindle pole
accumulation phenotype does not adequately capture the phenotype in their opinion.
Nonetheless, one cannot argue with math. The authors should either report the numbers and
make their argument about the quantification methodology in the results and methods sections,
or come up with another method of quantification that more adequately captures the phenotype
in their opinion. Avoiding quantification because it doesn’t look the same as “by eye” is not
scientifically rigorous in my opinion.
2. The author’s response to my previous point #4 does not adequately answer my question. The
author’s do not provide a quantitative, unbiased methodology for how they qualify what counts
as “bright foci” of dynein at spindle poles. I see the difference in the example they provide, but
the methodology is critical for any researcher wishing to follow up on this study.

The authors have satisfactorily responded to most of my queries but a couple of issues remain:
(i) I am ok with the authors using Arp1 staining for dynactin and NuMA and CSAP staining (not
gamma-tubulin, or pericetrin as requested) to mark the centrosomes/centrioles. But I strongly
feel that they should also test for Spindly, which is one of the bonafide adaptors for dynein, in
their experiments.
(ii) I was hoping that the authors would discuss more about what the off-target effects of the
different drugs used are likely to be in the context of the observed effects, but that discussion is
still missing in their response or in the manuscript.

1. Almost all of the figures are non-quantitative, showing only
examples of cell phenotypes. The authors should do a better job
of quantifying the different of phenotypes they observe. For
example, this should include the percentage of cells that show
abnormal phenotypes (all figs). More importantly the authors
should come up with a quantitative strategy to measure the
protein relocalization they observe in response to their drug
treatments. Example linescans drawn through the spindle poles,
coupled with statistical analysis of fluorescence intensity and
reporting of the percentage of cells that display a given
phenotype would be a good start.
We appreciate this important point regarding a quantitative analysis of
our findings. Indeed, we invested substantial efforts in developing a
methodology to quantitatively describe the spindle pole accumulation
that we observe. However, we ultimately found that fluorescence
intensity measurements, such as those suggested by the reviewer, did
not accurately capture the qualitative change that is clearly visible by
eye. For example, we imaged 25 mitotic cells expressing DHC-GFP
treated with either DMSO or PYR-41. We also stained these cells for
NuMA, a spindle pole localized protein that is not visibly affected by
PYR-41 treatment. We used the NuMA staining to mark the spindle
poles, and then measured the fluorescence intensity of the
corresponding area in the GFP channel. From a total of 25 cells, we
calculated an average integrated intensity of 372318 a.u. for spindle
pole localized dynein in control cells. For PYR-41 treated cells, the
average intensity was 583442 a.u., giving a 1.6 fold increase in DHC
signal at the poles. Shown below are representative, unprocessed
images used for the quantification. In the DMSO-treated cell below, the
calculated spindle pole intensities are 365959 a.u. and 375226 a.u.,
closely matching the average intensity for the dataset. Likewise, the
calculated spindle pole intensities in the PYR-41 cell below are 581527
a.u. and 601540 a.u., closely matching the average intensity of the
dataset.
DMSO PYR-41
The localization change is clearly very striking, but we feel that the
quantitative measure of a 1.6 fold change does not compellingly
capture the phenotype. This is likely due, at least in part, to a change
in the distribution of dynein at the poles in addition to an accumulation
of dynein at the poles. Unfortunately, this change in distribution is not
readily captured by quantification methods, including line scans.
Shown below are the line scan analyses for the DMSO and PYR-41
treated cells above. These data only clearly capture the amplitude
change, similar to our fluorescent intensity analysis.
For these reasons, we chose to include representative images in the
manuscript and instead quantify the percentage of cells that display
spindle pole accumulation of dynein for each drug that altered dynein
localization. These data are in Figure 5 (now revised Figure 6).
To highlight the robustness of the observed NSC697923-induced
accumulation of dynein within the manuscript, the sentence beginning
on line 95 now reads, “Under these conditions, the mitotic spindle was
largely preserved and we again observed strong dynein relocalizaton
to the spindle poles in almost 80% of cells in either prometaphase or
metaphase, compared to only 1% of cells treated with taxol alone
(Figure 1D).”
2. Is there really no accumulation of GFP-NudEL at spindle poles
in prometaphase (Fig. 2D)?
Under normal growth conditions, we do see punctate localization of
GFP-NdeL1 at mitotic spindle poles as shown in the representative
image below.
However, we typically do not observe robust localization of GFP-Nde1
to the spindle poles (as seen in Fig. 2D).
3. In addition to drug treatments, the authors also use a temp.
sensitive cell line to probe the role of Uba1 in dynein
relocalization. Confirmation of this result using RNAi against
Uba1 would be nice.
We appreciate this suggestion. To conduct an orthologous experiment
to eliminate Uba1, we generated a cell line containing Cas9 under the
control of a doxycycline inducible promoter and a stably expressed
sgRNA targeting Uba1 (see McKinley et al. 2015 for a description of
this robust inducible knockout strategy). Similar to our findings with the
temperature sensitive cell line, doxycycline treatment to induce Cas9
and eliminate Uba1 did not cause dynein to accumulate at the poles. In
addition, PYR-41 still induced dynein relocalization in these Uba1
inducible knockout cells. We refer to this data in the manuscript with
the following sentence beginning on line 178. “We were also unable to
validate the specificity of PYR-41 using a CRISPR/Cas9 based system
[33] to eliminate Uba1 from HeLa cells (data not shown).” However, we
note that the interpretation of this experiment, or a comparable RNAi-
based experiment, is complicated by the extended time duration
required to significantly deplete Uba1. We do not begin seeing
significant cell death until approximately 6 days after doxycycline
induction. For this reason, we focused our efforts in the manuscript on
chemical perturbations that act within minutes, or the temperature
sensitive genetic perturbation that acts within hours, as opposed to the
RNAi or CRISPR systems that require multiple days.
4. Fig. 5C, how do the authors qualify what counts as “strong”
DHC signal on spindle poles? The methods do not make this
very clear. Again, a more quantitative approach would be useful
here.
We apologize for this confusion. Because dynein normally localizes to
the spindle pole, we used the term “strong” to indicate a bright, foci of
dynein at the spindle poles. This in contrast to the fainter haze of
dynein at the spindle pole seen in control cells (see images in
response to point 1 above). To clarify this in the manuscript, we have
now changed the y-axis label in Figure 5C (now revised Figure 6C) to
read “% Mitotic Cells with DHC Punctate Foci at Spindle Poles”.
5. The authors use the term “dynein adapters” to describe non-
subunit dynien interacting proteins. The term “adapter” has been
more recently used to describe molecules that specifically link
dynien to dynactin and cargos (see recent review by Reck-
Peterson and Carter). The molecules described here by the
authors do not meet this more current definition, and I suggest
using a different term here for clarity. Perhaps “dynein
interactors” or “dynein effectors” would be more appropriate.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we have now use the
term “regulators” to describe these molecules, per the conventions
used in the recent review from Reck-Peterson et al.
6. The title is perhaps a bit misleading. While technically accurate,
the authors do conclude that the effects of the small molecules
may not be on-target.
We appreciate this comment, and have tried to be forthcoming and
cautious about the nature of our results throughout the manuscript. It is
absolutely possible, and perhaps even likely, that the effects we
observe are not on-target effects of inhibiting ubiquitination. We
therefore think it will be particularly important for cell biologists studying
ubiquitination to see and read our paper. For that reason, we chose a
title that we hoped would attract the attention of these researchers, as
well as dynein/cytoskeletal researchers, while still accurately reflecting
our findings.
Referee: 2
1. While I understand the authors caution, I would have liked to
see some more discussion of the potential targets for
ubiquitination, for example what is known about dynein subunit
modification from previous work. There are studies on dynein
subunit modification during cilium disassembly, targeting of the
dynein interaction NuMa by the BRISC Dub complex and
ubiquitination linked to spindle positioning that could be briefly
discussed in this context.
We thank the reviewer for their interest in our work and this suggestion
to more broadly discuss ubiquitination in the context of dynein function.
We now reference the suggested papers with the following sentence at
line 53 of the manuscript: “Indeed, evidence suggests that the dynein-
NuMA interaction is enhanced by non-degradative ubiquitination [16]
and a role for non-degradative ubiquitination has also been implicated
in indirectly targeting dynein to the cell cortex [17].” Because cilium
disassembly utilizes axonemal dynein as opposed to cytoplasmic
dynein, we feel that a discussion of its regulatory mechanisms is
beyond the scope of this manuscript.
Referee: 3
1. In Fig. 1, please quantify what % of mitotic cells showing spindle
disassembly phenotype in response to NSC697923? I gather
than only spindles that maintained bipolarity was selected for
the dynein pole localization analysis. Are the HeLa cell stably
expressing DHC-GFP? Please mention these details in the
results and legends section and not just in the methods for the
ease of the readers.
Approximately 20% of mitotic cells (n=100) display a near complete
disassembly of spindle microtubules in response to NSC697923
treatment, similar to that shown in the left NSC697923 panel in Figure
1B. We now state this in line 86 of the manuscript. The remaining cells
display altered spindle morphology, such as the cell shown in the right
NSC697923 panel in Figure 1B.
To clarify that we are using HeLa cells stably expressing DHC-GFP,
we have updated the sentence starting on line 77 to now read “To
begin, we treated HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged dynein
heavy chain (DHC-GFP)…” Additionally, all figure legends referring to
experiments utilizing cells expressing a transgene now indicate that the
transgene is stably expressed.
2. Other than Phosphosite plus (ref# 4), is there any direct
evidence for ubiquitination of dynein heavy chain being
important for its many cellular functions? A quick pubmed
search returned one publication for ubiquitination of the
p150glued subunit of dynactin (Zhang et al., BBRC, 2007) and
one for dynein intermediate chain (Thom et al., Developmental
Cell, 2014) . But I could not find any evidence for dynein HC.
Please comment. Also, it would be good to include these or any
other relevant references that you might find.
We are not aware of any studies dissecting the function of any of the
reported ubiquitination events on dynein heavy chain. However, there
have been multiple proteome-wide studies for ubiquitin modifications
that have identified sites on dynein or its interacting partners. We now
cite these studies in the manuscript on line 46. Remarkably, current
estimates suggest that the function of only ~1% of mapped
ubiquitination events have been identified to date. Thus, we anticipate
extensive efforts will be aimed at understanding the specific regulatory
events imparted by ubiquitination.
We also want to emphasize that if the observed spindle pole
accumulation is due to inhibition of ubiquitination, the relevant
ubiquitination site may not be within dynein heavy chain. Because
dynein function is also regulated by other proteins, it seems equally
likely that the ubiquitination site(s) may be within another subunit of the
dynein complex, within a dynein adaptor or regulator, or even within a
spindle localized protein that interacts with dynein.
3. As mentioned by the authors in the discussion, the result is very
similar to the ATP depletion experiments using Azide and
Deoxyglucose. Is there a way to test if the treatment with any of
these drugs is in fact causing the ATP levels to drop creating a
situation similar to that of Az/DOG treatment? Also, would it be
possible for the authors to test the phosphorylation status of the
dynein being accumulated at the spindle poles? As
dephosphorylated dynein tends to associate strongly to dynactin
at the spindle poles, maybe ubiquitination promotes a similar
behavior with regard to dynactin-binding, which could be tested.
We agree that the phenotypic similarity with ATP depletion is
interesting. Ubiquitination is an ATP-dependent process. Thus, it is
possible that these perturbations are actually acting through similar
mechanisms. Significantly though, PYR-41 treatment relocalizes
dynein much more rapidly than Az/DOG treatment. We therefore think
it is more likely that Az/DOG treatment causes dynein to relocalize by
indirectly inhibiting ubiquitination, rather than PYR-41 and NSC697923
treatment affecting ATP levels.
We feel that the abundance of phosphorylation events that have been
mapped to dynein (over 100 sites within dynein heavy chain itself plus
numerous additional sites within other subunits of the dynein complex)
precludes us from performing a careful analysis of the phosphorylation
status of the spindle pole localized dynein population. However, we did
test the effect of various inhibitors of mitotic kinases (Aurora, CDK,
Mps1 and Plk1) as well as treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor,
Okadaic acid, on mitotic dynein localization. We did not observe
alterations in dynein localization following treatment with these
inhibitors. We now mention this with the following sentence starting on
line 77: “To begin, we treated HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-
tagged dynein heavy chain (DHC-GFP) with inhibitors of mitotic
kinases and phosphatases to perturb cellular phosphorylation. We did
not observe any obvious changes in the mitotic localization of dynein
following transient inhibition of Aurora kinases (ZM 447439/VX680),
cyclin-dependent kinase (flavopiridol), Mps1 (Mps1-I), Plk1 (BI2536),
PP1 or PP2A (okadaic acid) (data not shown).”
We also performed a number of IP-mass spectrometry experiments
from PYR-41-treated cells to attempt to detect changes in the
interactors of dynein, Lis1 or ZW10. Although our mass spectrometry
was not quantitative, we did not observe any obvious changes that
would explain the altered localization. Because the results were
uninformative, we chose not to include this data in the paper.
4. The localization is interestingly on the inner side of the spindle
pole on the side away from the cortex. Is that always the case? I
was wondering what the authors thought about this and if so
why this would be the case. I would like to see a centrosome
marker staining as a part of the initial characterization of this
interesting distribution pattern.
We agree that we do frequently see dynein accumulation
predominantly on the inner side of the spindle pole. However, we also
frequently see a ring-shaped localization of dynein (see, for example,
the PYR-41 panel in revised Figure 5A or the NSC697923 panel in
revised Figure 6B). We find that the distribution of DHC approximately
mimics the localization of NuMA, although DHC is generally found just
internal to the NuMA ring. The panel below is now included as Figure
1E to highlight this relative spatial localization.
Additionally, related to comment 6 below, we note that we do not see a
change in NuMA localization following NSC697923 treatment.
5. I am very keen to see the behavior of Mad1/Mad2 and
Bub1/BubR1 after NSC697923 or PYR-41 treatment in either
prometaphase cells or in metaphase cells with Taxol (if there
are no metaphase cells to image without Taxol treatment). Also
Lis1 does not seem to be accumulating at poles that much in
Taxol-treated metaphase cells, contrary to the claim of the
authors.
We really appreciate this helpful suggestion. We have now conducted
these experiments. We find that MAD1 clearly accumulates at the
spindle poles following NSC697923 treatment. The behavior of MAD2
was more variable, but we typically saw some localization of MAD2 at
the spindle poles in NSC697923-treated cells that we never observed
in control cells. In contrast, we did not observe any changes in the
localization of Bub1. Representative images from these experiments
are shown below and now included as Figure 3C and D. We believe
that these data provide a valuable addition to the paper by more
broadly defining the proteins affected by NSC697923 treatment.
We apologize for inaccurately describing the effect on Lis1 localization.
The sentence starting on line 117 now reads “Lis1 strongly
accumulated at the spindle poles following NSC697923 treatment
during prometaphase (Figure 2C), whereas the localization of Nde1
was comparatively unaffected in both prometaphase and metaphase
(Figure 2D).”
6. Do the authors see the same pole accumulation with dynactin
and/or Spindly? Also are the localization of any bonafide spindle
pole components like <U+03B3>-tubulin, pericentrin, NUMA, etc, altered
in response to these drug treatments? As interesting as the
observations made in this study is, I feel that the experiments
mentioned here and in point (iv) are essential for a
comprehensive study and lend more validity to the observations
made here.
We appreciate this suggestion, and have now tested a larger range of
dynein-related proteins. ARP1, a subunit of the dynactin complex,
strongly localizes to mitotic spindle poles in untreated cells, with no
obvious alteration in localization following NSC697923 treatment.
Representative images are shown below and are now included as
Figure 2B.
We also do not see any alterations in the localization of the spindle-
pole localized proteins NuMA (see our response to comment 4 above)
or the centriole/spindle protein CSAP (Backer et al. 2012).
Representative CSAP images are shown below, and now included as
Figure 3A.
7. I wonder why the authors switch between GFP-ZW10 and anti-
ZW10 antibody staining in Fig. 2 and the rest of the other
figures. If they want to compare the lack of accumulation in Fig.
3 to that of accumulation in Fig. 2, then I feel that they should
use the same approach. Considering, that the ZW10 antibody
worked well in their experiments in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, it might be
best to just stick with that detection method instead of using
GFP-ZW10 cell line.
We appreciate this comment and apologize for the confusion. The
ZW10 antibody works well to detect spindle pole accumulation, but it
does a poor job of detecting the localization of ZW10 to mitotic
kinetochores (comparing revised Figure 3B to 4B). Thus, as an initial
characterization of the effect of NSC697923 treatment on ZW10
localization, we find the results to be more compelling with the GFP-
ZW10 cell line. Throughout the rest of the paper, we chose to use the
ZW10 antibody to conduct co-localization experiments and
demonstrate that, in a given cell, both DHC and ZW10 behave similarly
for each inhibitor. We feel that having two markers provides more
compellingly evidence of the robustness of the phenotypes we
observe.
To clarify this in the text we have now added the following sentence to
line 148 of the manuscript: “We also visualized endogenous ZW10 in
these cells by immunofluorescence and did not observe signal that
noticeably differed from DMSO-treated cells.”
8. This point is mostly a comment. The results in Fig. 4 suggest
that the effect could be produced by off-target effects and the
authors themselves provide evidence in support of this
possibility. All this leaves me a bit confused and wanting to
know how this off-target effect is produced? Both these drugs
are known to produce off-target effects and there are many
spindle pole components that might respond to the
ubiquitination/deubquitination system. The study would be more
impactful if there was any idea as to what causes this pole
accumulation of dynein considering that TAK-243 does not
cause this accumulation. Does TAK-243 cause spindle defects
similar to that of NSC697923 and PYR-41 and are chromosome
mis-alignments observed in those cells?
TAK-243 treatment does not cause obvious spindle or chromosome
alignment defects. It is also important to note that the effects of
NSC697923 and PYR-41 on the mitotic spindle are distinct.
NSC697923 treatment results in potent disassembly of the mitotic
spindle, and also appears to alter the morphology of interphase
microtubules. In contrast, PYR-41 treatment does not disassemble the
mitotic spindle. As seen in our live imaging in Figure 4B (now revised
Figure 5B), PYR-41 treatment causes the spindle poles to move
inwards towards the DNA, but the bipolar spindle remains intact. In
fixed cells, this change in spindle size is not readily apparent. Indeed
for the images in Figure 4A (now revised Figure 5A), we did not co-
treat with Taxol.
As a Ubc13 inhibitor, NSC697923 only inhibits a subset of the cellular
ubiquitination. This is in contrast to PYR-41 or TAK-243, inhibitors of
the ubiquitin E1, which should inhibit virtually all cellular ubiquitination.
Thus, it seems reasonably likely that the microtubule phenotypes we
observe after NSC697923 or PYR-41 treatment may also be due to off-
target effects.
9. Have the authors tried live imaging of DHC accumulation after
NSC697923 treatment similar to what they did with PYR-41
treatment and if so and do they find the same/similar kinetics of
pole accumulation? This point is not clear from the text currently
even though it is mentioned that the spindles start getting
disassembled after 15 mins of NSC697923 treatment.
We have tried live cell imaging following NSC697923 treatment.
Remarkably, in the presence of NSC697923, GFP is exquisitely
photosensitive and bleaches within approximately 1-2 seconds of
exposure to excitation wavelength light. This has precluded our ability
to perform time course experiments similar to what we show in Figure
4B (now revised Figure 5B) with PYR-41. However, based on the
individual images that we are able to collect, it does appear that DHC
accumulation after NSC697923 likely occurs with similar kinetics as
PYR-41 treatment. For fixed samples, we chose to dose the cells for
15 minutes to ensure robust and penetrant accumulation of dynein at
the spindle poles.
10. Since Nde1 was called NudE initially, it might be worth
mentioning this as an alternative name in the introduction as I
still see both names being used interchangeably.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have added this into line
43 of the manuscript.

1. I am still not happy with the author’s response about
quantification of phenotypes they report. As scientists, I think it
is important for us to report results as accurately as possible.
Therefore, the authors should include precise quantifications of
their phenotypes. For instance, citing “approximately 20% of
cells (line 86)” and “almost 80% of cells (line 96)” should be
replaced with actual numbers, with errors, calculated from the
data. In addition, the authors should provide the number of cells
quantified for each phenotype they report. Similar statistics
should be presented for ALL figures in the paper, as I only find
them for Fig. 1 in the current version. For instance, I have no
idea if ZW10 accumulated at the spindle poles in 1% or 99% of
cells treated with NSC697923 in Fig. 3B, and so on for all
reported phenotypes. The interpretation of these effects is
greatly affected by these statistics, and I feel that these
numbers must be disclosed to the reader in order to allow them
to make a scientific judgment about the data.
The authors argue in their response that a quantitative measure
of their spindle pole accumulation phenotype does not
adequately capture the phenotype in their opinion. Nonetheless,
one cannot argue with math. The authors should either report
the numbers and make their argument about the quantification
methodology in the results and methods sections, or come up
with another method of quantification that more adequately
captures the phenotype in their opinion. Avoiding quantification
because it doesn’t look the same as “by eye” is not scientifically
rigorous in my opinion.
We appreciate these additional comments. To address these points,
we have now made the following changes to further increase the
quantitative descriptions of our data:
1. The sentence beginning on line 84 now reads, “After only 15
minutes of treatment, NSC697923 caused a nearly complete
disassembly of the mitotic spindle in 23 of 100 mitotic cells
analyzed (Figure 1B).”
2. The sentence beginning at the end of line 94 now reads,
“Under these conditions, the mitotic spindle was largely
preserved and we again observed strong dynein relocalizaton
to the spindle poles in 79 +/- 6% of cells in either
prometaphase or metaphase, compared to only 1 +/- 2% of
cells treated with taxol alone (Figure 1D).”
3. We now state in all relevant figure legends that the images
shown are representative examples of the localization we
observed.
4. We have now included, as Supplemental Figure 1A (shown
below), representative line scan analyses for the metaphase
taxol and NSC697923 + taxol treated cells in Figure 1D. The
data is mentioned in the text on line 98 with the following
sentence, “Line scan analyses confirmed an increase in the
intensity of dynein signal at the spindle poles following
NSC697923 treatment (Figure S1A).”
5. We have now included, as Figure 6D (and shown below),
quantification of the percentage of mitotic cells displaying
spindle pole accumulation of ZW10 and MAD1 after treatment
with NSC697923, PR-619, and NSC697923 + PR-619.
Similar to dynein, PR-619 appears to suppress the
NSC697923-induced spindle pole accumulation of ZW10 and
MAD1.
2. The author’s response to my previous point #4 does not
adequately answer my question. The author’s do not provide a
quantitative, unbiased methodology for how they qualify what
counts as “bright foci” of dynein at spindle poles. I see the
difference in the example they provide, but the methodology is
critical for any researcher wishing to follow up on this study.
We acknowledge that the analysis of cells containing “bright foci” is
primarily qualitative (although we have scored the number of cells
displaying spindle pole accumulation for Figure 6). Importantly, even
when blinded to the experimental conditions, both authors were easily
able to identify which coverslips were control versus drug-treated
based on a clear relocalization of dynein and its associated factors. As
such, we are confident that this difference in behavior will be easily
repeated by other researchers wishing to conduct these experiments.
However, we do recognize that bias may have affected the binary call
for the few cells displaying intermediate phenotypes (we estimate this
to be at most 10-15% of cells). For this reason, we have chosen to
largely limit the quantification data to the graphs in Figure 6 to highlight
the robust nature of the phenotype without over-emphasizing the exact
percentages.
As ZW10 and MAD1 are not typically observed at the spindle poles,
the clear presence of both ZW10 and MAD1 at spindle poles following
NSC697923 treatment is particularly striking. For the revised paper, we
have now quantified the percentage of mitotic cells displaying spindle
pole-localized ZW10 or MAD1 following NSC697923 treatment (see
above) to provide an additional indicator of this robust relocalization
behavior. As described in the legend for Figure 6D, we note that all
cells with spindle pole-localized MAD1 also had ZW10 on the spindle
poles. A few cells with weak ZW10 signal did not display detectable
MAD1 localization.
Referee: 3
1. I am ok with the authors using Arp1 staining for dynactin and
NuMA and CSAP staining (not gamma-tubulin, or pericetrin as
requested) to mark the centrosomes/centrioles. But I strongly
feel that they should also test for Spindly, which is one of the
bonafide adaptors for dynein, in their experiments.
We appreciate this suggestion and have now conducted these
experiments to analyze Spindly localization in NSC697923-treated
cells. This data is shown below and included in the manuscript as
Figure 3C. We find that Spindly also accumulates at the spindle poles
following NSC697923 treatment.
2. I was hoping that the authors would discuss more about what
the off-target effects of the different drugs used are likely to be
in the context of the observed effects, but that discussion is still
missing in their response or in the manuscript.
We thank the reviewer for their interest in the potential off-target effects
of these compounds. The discussion has been substantially revised to
now include the following paragraph (beginning on line 251) about the
differential effects of the inhibitors on the mitotic spindle and recent
work examining the in vitro specificity of a ubiquitin E2 inhibitor.
“Inhibitors targeting both ubiquitin E1 and E2 enzymes cause an
increase in dynein signal at spindle poles, suggesting that dynein
localization is regulated by ubiquitination. Indeed, another inhibitor
of Ubc13, BAY 11-7082 [41], similarly relocalized dynein (data not
shown). However, recent in vitro studies demonstrated that BAY
11-7082 additionally inhibits the ubiquitin E1 enzyme [42]. As BAY
11-7082 shares structural similarity with NSC697923, it is plausible
that dynein relocalization induced by NSC697923 is actually also
due to inhibition of the ubiquitin E1 enzyme. Alternatively, our
observation that TAK-243, a more potent [30, 31] and presumably
more specific ubiquitin E1 inhibitor, does not cause the same
alteration in dynein localization suggests that there may be another
cellular target shared by both NSC697923 and PYR-41. Both PYR-
41 and NSC697923 are known to have off-target effects. PYR-41
has been shown to non-specifically cross-link proteins [43] and
NSC697923 inhibits the activity of several deubiquitinases in vitro
[44]. Additionally, it is important to note that TAK-243 treatment
does not obviously affect the mitotic spindle on the timescales
analyzed here. In contrast, PYR-41 treatment causes the spindle
poles to move inwards towards the DNA (Figure 5B). As an inhibitor
of the most upstream step in the ubiquitination pathway, PYR-41
should inhibit almost all cellular ubiquitination. Thus, it is particularly
surprising that NSC697923 treatment, which should only inhibit the
subset of ubiquitination events catalyzed by Ubc13, results in
potent disassembly of the mitotic spindle (Figure 1B). Therefore,
the distinct microtubule phenotypes we observe after PYR-41 or
NSC697923 treatment may be further evidence of off-target effects
of one or both compounds.”
We have also included a statement that the observed phenotypes
could be due to alterations in numerous proteins with the following
sentence beginning on line 243 of the revised manuscript.
“A second, non-mutually exclusive mechanism entails an enhanced
interaction between dynein and a spindle pole-localized protein due
to modification of dynein, a dynein regulator, or a spindle pole
protein.”
