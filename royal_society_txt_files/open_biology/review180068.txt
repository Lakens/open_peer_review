Reply to Reviewer 3:
This is an interesting study on the changes in oxidative stress over
the course of hibernation, but the paper could benefit from some
reorganization and the inclusion of additional information.
Title
Suggests that this study addresses oxidative stress in all
hibernators. Only one species has been tested here. Also, I’m not sure
what is intended by the phrase ‘extraordinary controllability’. Granted,
it’s an interesting pattern, but is it extraordinary?
Answer: Thank you for your constructive suggestions. We
absolutely agree that the scope of the title is inappropriate given only
one species was tested here. In addition, for the “extraordinary
controllability”, we wanted to express that Daurian ground squirrels
can initiate antioxidant defense against oxidative damage through
spontaneous interbout arousal during hibernation; moreover, most
changed indicators of oxidative stress recovered to SA or PRE levels
in post-hibernation. Based on your suggestions and the purpose of the
present study, we have changed the title to “Controllable oxidative
stress and tissue specificity in major tissues during the torpor-arousal
cycle in hibernating Daurian ground squirrels”. Please see the “Title”.
Introduction
The focus of the paper is on the relationship between hibernation
and oxidative stress; I would recommend introducing hibernation first
before describing general OS.
Answer: We appreciate your constructive reading of our work.
We have introduced hibernation first in the revised manuscript and
reorganized and revised the “Introduction”. Please see the
“Introduction” section.
L75-93 could use some clarification about what the increase and
decrease of different biomarkers suggest
Answer: Thank you for your kind suggestion. We have added the
implications about the increase and decrease of different biomarkers.
All modifications are in blue in the revised manuscript. Please see
lines 76-77 and 81–84 on page 3, and lines 96–99 on page 4.
L103-105 Citation?
Answer: Thank you. We apologize for our omission of the
references. We have added the references in the revised manuscript.
Please see lines 126, 128, 130, and 133 on page 5.
L103-108 it may be helpful to explain/go into more detail about
how OS can vary between tissue type
Answer: Thank you for your constructive suggestion.
Theoretically, the differences in oxygen consumption and blood flow
in tissues should result in differences in levels of oxidative stress. In
the human body, blood flow in the heart is 60 ml–90 ml/100 g • min at
resting state, while oxygen demand is 10-fold higher than the average
oxygen demand of all body tissues and 4.5-fold higher than that of
skeletal muscle (Wang, 2013). Furthermore, blood flow of the brain
accounts for 15%–20% of total blood volume, whereas oxygen
consumption accounts for ~25% of total oxygen consumption of the
entire body (Wang, 2013). Therefore, heart and brain tissues are more
susceptible and more easily damaged than other tissues due to
oxidative stress induced by hypoxic ischemia and reperfusion (Wang,
2013). The liver is an important detox apparatus of the body, whereas
the kidney is a major excretory organ involved in the regulation of
blood pressure, erythrocyte production, and calcium metabolism and is
closely related to oxidative stress (Bai, 2013). We reinterpreted the
reasons for sensitivity to oxidative stress between different tissues in
the revised manuscript. Please see lines 123–133 on page 5.
Given what is known from other studies, what do the authors
expect to see in this study? There are no clear hypotheses or
predictions stated.
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. We have supplemented
the hypothesis of the study in the revised manuscript. We hypothesized
that hibernating squirrels might adjust their antioxidant defense to
prevent or diminish potential oxidative damage in major oxidative
tissues during the torpor-arousal cycle; moreover, the differences in
oxygen consumption and blood flow in tissues may have resulted in
the differences in the levels of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense
strategy. Please see lines 120–123 on page 5.
Materials and Methods
How many squirrels were used? Were they male or female,
juvenile or adult, reproductive or nonreproductive? All of these factors
can influence metabolic rate.
Answer: Thank you for these questions. We completely agree that
gender, age, and reproductive status can influence metabolic rate. We
apologize for the vague description of the individuals. In the present
study, 192 Daurian ground squirrels were used to study oxidative
stress. The different tissue samples were not from the same squirrels as
we wished to obtain the samples as soon as possible and avoid
post-traumatic oxidative stress due to ischemia and pain during
operation. The sample size was eight for each organ in each group.
For gender, there were more female Daurian ground squirrels than
males. Thus, there were fewer males than females in every group
(usually female:male = 3:1 per group).
For age, we used adult Daurian ground squirrels (2–3-year-olds).
Dental records are commonly used to determine age as the wearing
down of teeth is correlated with how long an animal has been eating. A
2-year-old squirrel has experienced one hibernation season and has
reached sexual maturity. The dentate plaque of the first and second
upper molars are basically intact horseshoe-shaped. The dentate
groove accounts for two-thirds to three-quarters of the entire chewing
surface. The dentate plaque of the lower molar is teardrop- or
dot-shaped (Wang et al., 1994). A 3-year-old squirrel has experienced
two hibernation seasons. The dentate plaques of the first and second
upper molars are basically intact horseshoe-shaped. The dentate
groove accounts for one-half to two-thirds of the entire chewing
surface. The dentate plaque of the lower molar is basically the
I-shaped (Wang et al., 1994). Moreover, there are generally more
females Daurian ground squirrels than males between the ages of 2–3
years (Wang et al., 1994). Thus, the experimental Daurian ground
squirrels in the current study were all adults. We apologize for the lack
of experimental description in the previous manuscript.
As for reproductive state, we used non-reproductive squirrels,
which was possible because Daurian ground squirrels breed once a
year and the breeding season is concentrated. After 10 d of restoration
after hibernation, the squirrels enter the breeding season (generally
from April to May) (Wang et al., 1994). The Daurian ground squirrels
in our experiment were captured in mid-June and were thus
non-reproductive.
We have supplemented the above information in the revised
manuscript. Please see lines 164–166 on page 6.
How were the animals euthanized?
Answer: We apologize for our omission. At the end of surgical
intervention, the animals were sacrificed by an overdose injection of
sodium pentobarbital. We have supplemented the relevant information
in the revised manuscript. Please see lines 182–183 on page 7.
The names of the assay kits used should be included along with
the manufacturer information L153, 167, 176, 186
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. We have supplemented
the names of the assay kits in the revised manuscript. Please see lines
203 on page 7, lines 216–217, 227–228 on page 8, and lines 238 on
page 9.
How do the authors define a hibernation bout?
Answer: Thank you for your question. The succession of entry
into torpor, deep torpor, arousal, and aroused state is called a
hibernation bout. The entire hibernation season is a sequence of 10–20
such bouts, depending on the duration of the season and length of the
deep torpor periods (Storey et al., 2010). Recurring periods of torpor
commonly last for 1–2 weeks in small mammalian hibernators,
interspersed with brief spontaneous arousal resulting in euthermic
rewarming (<24 h) (Carey et al., 2003). We have supplemented the
definition of hibernation bout in the revised manuscript. Please see
lines 43–48 on page 2.
The experimental categories are unclear:
PRE – L128 did some squirrels enter torpor, and the ones that did
not were selected for this group?
Answer: Thank you for your constructive question and we
apologize for the confusion. We defined the pre-hibernation group
(PRE) as squirrels who had not entered torpor by late September and
showed a stable Tb value of 36°C–38°C. Based on decades of
observation by our laboratory group, Daurian ground squirrels in the
Xi’an region of Shaanxi in China enter torpor from late October to
early December. Thus, squirrels in the PRE group had not entered
torpor. We have revised the definition of the PRE group in the revised
manuscript. Please see lines 153–155 on page 6.
ET and LT – it would be helpful to include the rationale for
creating these two categories.
Answer: Thank you for your kind suggestion. The difference
between ET (after two months hibernation (70 ± 8 d) squirrels entered
into a new hibernation bout with Tb maintained at 5°C–8°C for less
than 24 h) and LT (after two months hibernation (65 ± 5 d) animals
entered into a new hibernation bout and were in continuous torpor for
at least 5 d with a stable Tb of 5°C–8°C) is that the time of ischemia
and hypoxia differed (torpor time length). We measured the levels of
oxidative stress and antioxidant defense with the extension of
hibernation time during a hibernation bout by comparing the levels for
ET and LT. This was also useful for evaluating the role of periodic
interbout arousal (IBA) in antioxidant defense during the hibernation
season. Squirrels maintained stable torpor with a low Tb (5°C–8°C)
for 7–10 d during a hibernation bout after experiencing two months of
hibernation. Thus, to ensure the individual changes in each LT group
were consistent, our sampling time was set to 5 d with a stable Tb of
5°C–8°C. We have added the reasons for creating these two groups in
the revised manuscript. Please see lines 167–175 on page 6.
Were the squirrels forcibly aroused after two months, or how was
this controlled?
Answer: Thank you for your question. Mammalian hibernation
can be characterized by repeated torpor-arousal cycles. Recurring
periods of torpor commonly last for 1–2 weeks in small mammalian
hibernators, interspersed with brief spontaneous interbout arousal
resulting in euthermic rewarming (<24 h) (Carey et al., 2003).
Therefore, we took samples two months (65 ± 5 d) after hibernation
when hibernating squirrels spontaneously aroused from torpor, i.e.,
IBA group. The ET and LT animals were in the torpor state for about
two months. Thus, no squirrels were forcibly aroused, rather they all
aroused spontaneously. We have supplemented the information in the
revised manuscript. Please see lines 159–161 on page 6.
POST – how much variation was there in the number of days that
a squirrel had been awake prior to sample collection?
Answer: We used thermal imaging with a visual thermometer
(Fluke VT04 Visual IR Thermometer, USA) to measure the Tb
throughout the hibernation season. To reduce the impact of hibernation,
the Tb of squirrels was recorded twice a day (8:00 am and 8:00 pm).
Animals that fully and spontaneously awakened from hibernation and
maintained a Tb of 36°C–38°C for 2–4 d in March of the following
year were nominated as the POST group (Gao et al., 2012). Thus, in
the present study, we sampled within 24 h after a squirrel
spontaneously and fully awakened from hibernation and maintained a
Tb of 36°C–38°C for 3 d in March of the following year (POST group).
We have revised the definition in the manuscript. Please see lines
162–164 on page 6.
What was the sample size for each category?
Answer: We apologize for our omission. We have supplemented
the sample size for each group (n = 8 per organ) in the revised
manuscript. Please see lines 164–166 on page 6.
Is ANOVA the most appropriate analyses for these data? It looks
like several of the measurements could be modeled longitudinally.
Also, there is likely some correlation between measurements of the
different tissues if they were taken from the same squirrel. How was
individual variation controlled for? It would also be a good idea to
include sex of the animals into the model.
Answer: Thank you very much for your questions and
constructive suggestions. Firstly, we do believe that ANOVA is an
appropriate analysis method according to the properties and quality of
the data and our previous studies.
Secondly, the ground squirrels in each period of the experiment
were not the same ones as each ground squirrel was only sampled once
and then euthanized; accordingly, no measurements were modeled
longitudinally.
Thirdly, the 192 Daurian ground squirrels were used to study
oxidative stress. The different tissue samples are not from the same
squirrel as we wanted to ensure that the samples were obtained as soon
as possible and that we avoided the generation of oxidative stress.
Thus, we sampled only one tissue from each ground squirrel. For
example, a ground squirrel was firstly anesthetized, with the heart
surgically sampled, then immediately washed, dried, weighed and
frozen — a series of steps that took considerable time. If we finished
that work and then sampled other tissue (e.g., liver), post-traumatic
oxidative stress may have occurred due to ischemia and pain while the
squirrel was in a mid-surgery state (i.e., open chest and no blood
circulation). Thus, we only sampled one tissue from each squirrel. As
the different tissues did not come from the same squirrel, the
correlation between different tissues was not close. We have added the
above content in the revised manuscript. Please see lines 180–182 on
page 7.
Fourthly, regarding individual differences and animal gender, we
fully agree that these factors can impact the data. To control the impact
of individual differences, all animals were grouped according to
weight matching to ensure equal distribution of weight in each period.
Regarding the impact of gender, generally there are more female
Daurian ground squirrels than males. Thus, there were fewer males
than females in each group (usually female:male = 3:1 per group),
making it difficult to compare differences between genders in the
present study.
We have also added data on organ weights. Results showed that
there were no significant differences in the weights of each organ
during the different periods of hibernation. We have supplemented the
data and results in the revised manuscript. Please see lines 274–280 on
page 10 and lines 491–501 on page 17.
Results
These are rather difficult to read through, although I understand
the challenge, given the number of variables and comparisons. I think
revisiting how the data is analyzed may help clean things up in this
section
Answer: Thank you for your kind suggestion. Accordingly, we
have revised the results section in the manuscript. Please see the
“Results” section.
L224-227 should be in either the introduction or the methods
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. We have revised the
methods section in the manuscript. Please see lines 190-194 on page
7.

paper
Answer: Thank you. We have corrected the mistake in the revised
manuscript. Please see lines 289–290 on page 10.
L240 why ‘obviously’?
Answer: Thank you. We are very sorry for the confusion. A P
value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We have
rewritten the related MDA results in the revised manuscript. Please see
lines 296–308 on page 10-11.
Discussion
