As stated by the authors, the rich diversity of invertebrate species, genomes, and the time and
cost efficiency of raising and experimenting on these species have enabled a handful of the
species to become excellent model organisms.
This is an interesting review and the background, the objectives of the work have been properly

Open Biology, Zhu et al.
The authors have sought to summarise data on glycans in invertebrates, especially Drosophila
and Caenorhabditis. However, there are some inaccuracies in this review which must be
corrected regardless of the final publication decision for Open Biology - I will not claim to have
found all mistakes and grammatical errors. I also do not seek that it be comprehensive, but it
must be accurate.
Page 1, Line 5: The first sentence of the abstract is one of the most common statements about
glycosylation - the exact same phrase can be found in Ceciliani et al, 2007, in Hayes et al, 2012 or
Cornelissen et al, 2016 (to name the first few google ‘hits’). The authors should seek to have at
least the first sentence different to those elsewhere in the literature.
Line 18: ‘on the model organismS’ (plural), then spelling of Caenorhabditis (not Carno …)
Page 2, Line 6: “97%” would be of animal species not of all the earth’s species - put a semi-colon
(;) after the word ‘invertebrates’.
Line 8: I would not say that the ‘vast majority’ of invertebrate glycomic studies have been on
recombinant proteins - certainly a large number, but what about individual glycoprotein antigens
from Echinococcus, glycoprotein allergens from insect venoms or haemocyanins from snails,
never mind the various whole-organism studies?
Page 3, line 15 - not ‘inside the body of mammals’, rather ‘inside animal cells’.
line 18: ‘terminal’ rather than ‘end’
line 21: ‘glycoSYLtransferases’
Figure 1: panel A is ok, but for panel B - Trichomonas is not an invertebrate species (note spelling
of species) - it is a protist; the authors could put a PC on the structure in Lymantria (PC also
found in Trichoplusia ni), add a trifucosylated core for C. elegans or a GalFuc core with
methylaminoethylphosphonate from a marine snail, a xylosylated glycan from some species (e.g.,
Schistosoma or snail) or triantennary PE-modified glucuronylated glycans from royal jelly (recent
paper in MCP). They should also add mannose to the set of monosaccharides. AEP is
aminoethylphosphONate.
Page 4, line 13 - write ‘insect cells’ not ‘insect body’.
Page 5, line 8 - what is meant by a high degree of structure conservation with those in mammals?
which structures? Of course, three antennae are possible in C. elegans, but these are not
galactosylated - the galactose residues being on fucose residues or on mannose (e.g., bisecting
position).
line 11 - write ‘dipteran species, specifically mosquito larvae, were …’
4
line 15 - PE is phosphoethanOLamine; Volvarina (Eckmair, MCP, 2016) is a mollusc and does not
fit so well in the same sentence as two moths - but could be mentioned elsewhere - with branched
Fuc, GlcA modifications, phosphonate and a trace of PC.
line 23 - ‘glycoSYLtransferases’
Page 6, line 15 - a number of glycomics studies have been done on gene knock-out strains in C.
elegans - e.g., fut-1/fut-6/fut-8, gly-12/gly-13/gly-14, hex-2/hex-3, aman-2, bre-1. RNAi has also
been done on glycogenes from C. elegans. Also the nac mutant (GDP-Fuc) transporter in
Drosophila was investigated glycomically (Geisler, JBC).
Page 7, line 4 - ribose is not found in invertebrate N-glycans, but GalNAc is; check spelling of N-
glycoyLneuraminic. Further variation with methyl groups or anionic/zwitterionic groups could
be mentioned.
Page 7, line 16 and pages 8/9 - the routine nature might be ‘large scale N-glycoproteomics’ to
identify glycosylation sites, but the in-depth analysis to find new structures in invertebrates is far
from routine and certainly Glycoworkbench is not ok for dealing with novel structures! The
‘analytical’ discussion focuses on glycoproteomics and does not mention the great advances
recently made with off-line LC-MALDI-MS in order to find new structures.
Page 9, line 16 - suggest ‘O-glycosylation in invertebrates’ (also without word ‘the’)
Page 10, line 11 - ‘however, few of these have been …’
Figure 2: the first structure shown might well be a breakdown product of a GAG; structures from
Drosophila with GlcA could also be drawn, based on the literature - far from everything is in
UnicarbKB!
Page 11, line 5 - actually if looking at Kurz et al, Figure 13 and Suppl Figure 11, then it is shown
that Drosophila has sulphated O-glycans; Vespula has PE (not PC) on its O-glycans.
line 13 - spelling of Golgi (not ‘Gogi’)
line 23 - fringe is not a ‘glucotransferase’ but an ‘N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase’ and the O-Fuc
glycans can get glucuronylated.
Page 12 - note that the CaZy family 105 (TMTC) has members in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis,
but their mannosyltransferase activity is yet to be proven in these organisms.
Table 1: probably no O-glycan in Drosophila carries sialic acid and for O-Man, only a mannose
can be confirmed and the tetrasaccharide for O-Fuc is also wrong. The spelling of ‘Gogi’ (i.e.,
Golgi) needs correction; remove word ‘body’ from the various ‘functions’, correct ‘abd’ to ‘and’.
For O-Man ‘growth and embryonic/organ development’ should be enough. In the case of O-Glc,
xylosylation by ‘shams’ is known. The PE containing glycolipid in Drosophila has a GalNAc on
the GlcNAc - recheck with Seppo/Tiemeyer paper.
GlcA on O-glycans has been examined at a genetic level by Tiemeyer/Nishihara.
Page 13 - write ‘there are’ not ‘there’re’
Page 15 - wheatgerm agglutinin can be used for O-GlcNAc
Page 16 - ‘kurodai’ with small ‘k’
Page 17: the glycolipid termin quoted are incorrect and must be re-checked with the literature -
e.g., GalNAc-alpha1,4-GalNAc-beta1,4- as far as I know. PE is present on dipteran glycolipids
and AEP on those of molluscs.
5
Figure 3: is the first structure with AEP for Drosophila really correct? in which paper was this
published? Spelling of ‘Caeno’ not ‘Carno’.
Pages 19-21 - recently novel GAG structures were found in a parasitic nematode worm and
relatively long GAG chains released by hydrazinolysis of C. elegans. Sulphation is at a low level
for C. elegans CS.
Page 21: the authors ask about the reasons for glycosylation - as Varki wrote in one review, no
cell exists without surface sugars. Sugars confer heterogeneity and mean you have many different
forms of a single glycoprotein which mean you can tune interactions and activities.

Open Biology, Zhu et al., revised
The authors have revised their summary of data on glycans in invertebrates, especially
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. However, there are some smaller points for revision.
Page 1, Line 18: not corrected - ‘on the model organismS’ (plural), then spelling of Caenorhabditis
(not Carno …)
Page 2, Line 3: ‘occurS’ - singular form of verb with ‘s’ on end.
Page 4, Line 23: ‘phosphorYLcholine’ (also page 6, line 22; page 16, line 6; page 18, line 9)
Page 5, Line 1: ‘phosphoethANOLamine’ (also page 10, line 21 and page 16, line 2)
Page 10, Line 15: ‘addS’ - singular form of verb with ‘s’ on end.
Page 10, Line 22: italicise Vespula germanica
Page 12, Line 8: the introduced part of the sentence is not correct, as Ichimaya et al did do in vitro
assays on co-transfected Sf21 cells to show activity. What is meant rather is that the TMTC-type
mannosyltransferases of CaZy family 105, not the POMT1/2 ones, have not yet been assayed in
Caenorhabditis & Drosophila. TMTC is an alternative O-mannosylation pathway relevant to
cadherins rather than dystroglycan.
Page 13, Line 6: ‘O-GlcNAcylation can actually occur in the nucleus and cytosol’
Page 13, Line 14 - at end of paragraph add: ‘There is also an extracellular form of O-
GlcNAcylation on EGF repeats mediated by the EOGT enzyme in the ER.” (e.g., review by
Varshney & Stanley, 2017, Biochem Soc Trans).
10
Page 15, Line 9 - ‘Glycosphingolipids in invertebrates’
Page 15, Line 23: “In Drosophila, the core mactosyl Man(b1-4)Glc structure”
Page 16, Line 3 - ‘…phosphoNate’
Page 16, Line 7 - “GSLs of the lepidopteran species Bombyx mori were … but novel extensions
were revealed.” (italicise Bomby mori)
Page 16, Line 10 - as mactosyl ceramide is defined on page 15, no need to define again.
Page 17, Line 10 - ‘Glycosaminoglycans in invertebrates’
Page 17, Line 18 - “only heparan and chondroitin chains with or without sulphate.”
Page 17, Lines 19/20 - the sentence starting ‘Invertebrates’ repeats the one at the end of the
previous paragraph and so can be deleted.
Page 18, Line 8 - “heparan, 91, whereby the relevant enzymes synthesising the core are encoded
by genes defective in sqv mutants” (here refer to Esko/Horvitz)
Page 18, Line 18 - remove the sentences starting ‘for example’ and ‘the GAGs’ - instead write “As
for Caenorhabditis, the GAGs in Drosophila are based on the same canonical GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl
core for attachment to proteins; some of the relevant enzymes have been characterised, such as
oxt (Wilson, J Biol Chem , 2002) and GalT7 (Vadaie & Jarvis, J Biol Chem, 2002).
Page 19 - line 18 - can also add ‘or hydrazinolysis’
Ref 41: ‘Guérardel’ (not with capital ÉR)
Ref 82: not J Biol Chem but J Biochem (Tokyo)
Ref 84: italicise Drosophila and remove <em&gt
Table 1: For O-Fuc, no Gal in Drosophila, rather a branched trisaccharide GlcA(GlcNAc)Fuc; also
O-Man is probably not extended. Suggest making all glycans scaled to same size of
monosaccharide.
Figure 1: the Volvarina structure is methylated on the unknown antennal hexose.
Figure 2: First three Drosophila structures, the terminal HexNAc or Hex are undefined (not
necessarily GlcNAc or Gal); the sixth structure should have no terminal Gal; the seventh/last
structure are fine if the undefined HexNAc would be sulphated.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
As stated by the authors, the rich diversity of invertebrate species, genomes, and
the time and cost efficiency of raising and experimenting on these species have
enabled a handful of the species to become excellent model organisms.
This is an interesting review and the background, the objectives of the work have
been properly described. Before accept, there are still some points that I want to
discuss with the authors to make the review be clearly addressed as below.
1.Page 2, line 19-22, “Studying invertebrate glycosylation, especially... assists
understanding glycobiology and targeted glycoengineering in both invertebrates
and vertebrates.” What is the most differences between the invertebrates and
vertebrates in the glycobiology and targeted
glycoengineering? Please add the most concise summary to this part.
Response: The N-glycosylation pathway in mammals is clear (Page 3 Line 17-
22), however, invertebrates’ N-glycosylation pathway have not been fully
elucidated and remains controversial (Page 4 Line 1-8). Glycan structures are
species specific and can alter upon physiological, pathological, or developmental
stages for both invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrate glycans was once
thought not as complicated as in vertebrates, but increasing studies have been
demonstrating the unexpected rich diversity of invertebrate glycans.
2.Page 4, Figure 1, Examples of N-glycans in invertebrate sepecies, I can not
find the relative description of this fiugre in the text. Please position it.
Response: We have added discussion on Figure 1 and referenced Figure 1 in the
manuscript (see text).
3.Page 13, Table 1, also I can not find the description in the text. Please position
it in the text.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the comments and have added discussion
on Table 1 and referenced it in the text (see text).
4.Page 21-22, Concluding remarks The conclusion is so long which will make
the paper not clear and comprehensive, so please refine the conclusion carefully.
Response: We have shortened and refined the concluding remarks so that it is
more concise and comprehensive (see text).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_8
Open Biology, Zhu et al.
The authors have sought to summarise data on glycans in invertebrates,
especially Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. However, there are some inaccuracies
in this review which must be corrected regardless of the final publication
decision for Open Biology - I will not claim to have found all mistakes and
grammatical errors. I also do not seek that it be comprehensive, but it must be
accurate.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and we have
carefully revised the manuscript to minimize grammatical errors and ensure
accurate and appropriate expressions. Changes are highlighted in red.
Page 1, Line 5: The first sentence of the abstract is one of the most common
statements about glycosylation - the exact same phrase can be found in Ceciliani
et al, 2007, in Hayes et al, 2012 or Cornelissen et al, 2016 (to name the first few
google ‘hits’). The authors should seek to have at least the first sentence different
to those elsewhere in the literature.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, and have modified the first
sentence so that it does not resemble other papers.
“Glycosylation refers to the covalent attachment of sugar residues to a protein
or lipid, and the biological importance of this modification has been widely
recognized.”
Line 18: ‘on the model organismS’ (plural), then spelling of Caenorhabditis (not
Carno …)
Response: We thank the reviewer for the corrections and has corrected in the
manuscript.
Page 2, Line 6: “97%” would be of animal species not of all the earth’s species -
put a semi-colon (;) after the word ‘invertebrates’.
Response: We have made the corrections in the manuscript.
Line 8: I would not say that the ‘vast majority’ of invertebrate glycomic studies
have been on recombinant proteins - certainly a large number, but what about
individual glycoprotein antigens from Echinococcus, glycoprotein allergens from
insect venoms or haemocyanins from snails, never mind the various whole-
organism studies?
Response: We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and have modified the
sentence in the text.
“So far, many invertebrate glycomic studies have focused on recombinant
glycoproteins, for example, expressed using the baculovirus system. Recent
years, increasing numbers of studies have been focusing on the glycomes
originally derived from invertebrate species.”
Page 3, line 15 - not ‘inside the body of mammals’, rather ‘inside animal cells’.
Response: Correction has been made.
line 18: ‘terminal’ rather than ‘end’
Response: Correction has been made.
line 21: ‘glycoSYLtransferases’
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction and have revised the term
throughout the text.
Figure 1: panel A is ok, but for panel B - Trichomonas is not an invertebrate
species (note spelling of species) - it is a protist; the authors could put a PC on
the structure in Lymantria (PC also found in Trichoplusia ni), add a
trifucosylated core for C. elegans or a GalFuc core with
methylaminoethylphosphonate from a marine snail, a xylosylated glycan from
some species (e.g., Schistosoma or snail) or triantennary PE-modified
glucuronylated glycans from royal jelly (recent paper in MCP). They should also
add mannose to the set of monosaccharides. AEP is aminoethylphosphONate.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. We have added
more N-glycan structures from additional invertebrate species in Figure 1 as
suggested by the reviewer, and have deleted the structure from the protest
Trichomonas. Mannose have been added to the monosaccharide set in the figure
legend.
Page 4, line 13 - write ‘insect cells’ not ‘insect body’.
Response: Correction has been made.
Page 5, line 8 - what is meant by a high degree of structure conservation with
those in mammals?
which structures? Of course, three antennae are possible in C. elegans, but these
are not galactosylated - the galactose residues being on fucose residues or on
mannose (e.g., bisecting position).
Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have modified the
sentence to avoid overstatement.
“…the nematode Caenorhabditis also contains a nearly contiguous series of N-
glycans”
line 11 - write ‘dipteran species, specifically mosquito larvae, were …’
Response: Corrections have been made.
line 15 - PE is phosphoethanOLamine; Volvarina (Eckmair, MCP, 2016) is a
mollusc and does not fit so well in the same sentence as two moths - but could be
mentioned elsewhere - with branched Fuc, GlcA modifications, phosphonate and
a trace of PC.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction. The sentence have been
modified in the text.
“…core difucosylated and zwitterion phosphorycholine and phosphoethylamine
modified N-glycans were also identified in a handful of invertebrate species such
as Trichoplusia ni and Lymantria dispar. The mollusc Volvarina rubella was
also found to contain N-glycans with phosphonate and phosphorcholine
modifications in addition to Fuc and GlcA modifications. Additionally,
xylosylated glycans and triantennary phosphoethylamine-modified
glucuronylated glycans have also been identified from Schistosoma and
honeybee royal jelly, respectively.”
line 23 - ‘glycoSYLtransferases’
Response: correction has been made.
Page 6, line 15 - a number of glycomics studies have been done on gene knock-
out strains in C. elegans - e.g., fut-1/fut-6/fut-8, gly-12/gly-13/gly-14, hex-2/hex-
3, aman-2, bre-1. RNAi has also been done on glycogenes from C. elegans. Also
the nac mutant (GDP-Fuc) transporter in Drosophila was investigated
glycomically (Geisler, JBC).
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. We have added in
the text the discussion regarding the genetically engineered invertebrate species
for understanding the functions of specific glycoenzymes as well as relevant
literature.
“In fact, genetically engineered mutants of Caenorhabditis and Drosophila have
been established in order to reveal the biological functions of specific
glycoenzymes such as fucosyltransferases, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases,
hexosaminidases, and other glycoenzymes.”
Page 7, line 4 - ribose is not found in invertebrate N-glycans, but GalNAc is;
check spelling of N-glycoyLneuraminic. Further variation with methyl groups or
anionic/zwitterionic groups could be mentioned.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction and comments. Spelling has
been corrected. Further modification of the monosaccharides has been discussed
in the text.
“Further modifications of the monosaccharides such as methylation, sulphation,
and zwitterionic modification including phosphorycholine, phosphoethanolamine
and aminoethyl phosphate have also been identified in invertebrates.”
Page 7, line 16 and pages 8/9 - the routine nature might be ‘large scale N-
glycoproteomics’ to identify glycosylation sites, but the in-depth analysis to find
new structures in invertebrates is far from routine and certainly Glycoworkbench
is not ok for dealing with novel structures! The ‘analytical’ discussion focuses on
glycoproteomics and does not mention the great advances recently made with
off-line LC-MALDI-MS in order to find new structures.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. We agree with the
author and have modified the related statements in the text and added discussion
on the powerful glycan analysis tool by off-line LC-MALDI-MS.
“Although the filter-aided deamidation method can perform large scale
identification of protein glycosylation sites, it cannot provide information on the
specific glycan structures attached to the glycosylation site.”
“That said, in-depth analysis of the N-glycomes, especially finding novel glycan
structures, can still be quite challenging and far from routine. A combination of
exoglycosidase digestion, offline LC separation and purification, as well as
MALDI-TOF MS/MS or LC/MS/MS analysis is usually needed in order to reveal
new glycan structures.”
Page 9, line 16 - suggest ‘O-glycosylation in invertebrates’ (also without word
‘the’)
Response: We have revised the section title to “O-glycosylation in
invertebrates”.
Page 10, line 11 - ‘however, few of these have been …’
Response: We have modified the sentence.
Figure 2: the first structure shown might well be a breakdown product of a GAG;
structures from Drosophila with GlcA could also be drawn, based on the
literature - far from everything is in UnicarbKB!
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction and suggestion. We have
modified Figure 2 in the manuscript to include Drosophila mucin type O-
glycans.
Page 11, line 5 - actually if looking at Kurz et al, Figure 13 and Suppl Figure 11,
then it is shown that Drosophila has sulphated O-glycans; Vespula has PE (not
PC) on its O-glycans.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction, and has revised the
sentence in the text.
“So far sulfated O-glycans have been identified in Drosophila but not
Caenorhabditis, and phosphoethylamine modification has been reported in the
insect Vespula germanica… ”
line 13 - spelling of Golgi (not ‘Gogi’)
Response: Correction has been made.
line 23 - fringe is not a ‘glucotransferase’ but an ‘N-
acetylglucosaminyltransferase’ and the O-Fuc glycans can get glucuronylated.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction. Correction has been made
and we have modified the sentence in the manuscript (see text).
Page 12 - note that the CaZy family 105 (TMTC) has members in Drosophila
and Caenorhabditis, but their mannosyltransferase activity is yet to be proven in
these organisms.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments, and have modified
the sentence in the text.
“… POMT1 and POMT2, function in association with each other to maintain
normal muscle development, though their mannosyltransferase activity in this
organism is yet to be proven.”
Table 1: probably no O-glycan in Drosophila carries sialic acid and for O-Man,
only a mannose can be confirmed and the tetrasaccharide for O-Fuc is also
wrong. The spelling of ‘Gogi’ (i.e., Golgi) needs correction; remove word ‘body’
from the various ‘functions’, correct ‘abd’ to ‘and’. For O-Man ‘growth and
embryonic/organ development’ should be enough. In the case of O-Glc,
xylosylation by ‘shams’ is known. The PE containing glycolipid in Drosophila
has a GalNAc on the GlcNAc - recheck with Seppo/Tiemeyer paper.
GlcA on O-glycans has been examined at a genetic level by Tiemeyer/Nishihara.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the comments and correction. The spelling
mistakes have been corrected. The word “body” has been removed from various
“functions”. The O-Man functions have been modified. Xylosylation by ‘shams’
have been added to the discussion. The structures of the exemplary glycans in
Table 1 have been redrawn to ensure consistence with literature (see text).
Page 13 - write ‘there are’ not ‘there’re’
Response: We have modified the sentence in the text.
Page 15 - wheatgerm agglutinin can be used for O-GlcNAc
Response: We agree with the reviewer that wheat germ agglutinin, specifically,
lectin weak affinity chromatography, can be applied for O-GlcNAc enrichment
and have incorporated in the discussion (see text).
Page 16 - ‘kurodai’ with small ‘k’
Response: Correction has been made.
Page 17: the glycolipid termin quoted are incorrect and must be re-checked with
the literature - e.g., GalNAc-alpha1,4-GalNAc-beta1,4- as far as I know. PE is
present on dipteran glycolipids and AEP on those of molluscs.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction and comments. We have
corrected and revised the sentence in the text.
“In Drosophila, the core structure can be further modified with a GalNAcß1-4-
GlcNAcßl1-3 residue, and the terminal Gal can be further capped with GlcA.
Phosphoehtylamine is present as a typical modification to dipteran glycolipids
and aminoethylphosphoate to those of molluscs.”
Figure 3: is the first structure with AEP for Drosophila really correct? in which
paper was this published? Spelling of ‘Caeno’ not ‘Carno’.
Response: We apologize for the drawing mistake and have corrected the
structures in Figure 3
The spelling has also been corrected.
Pages 19-21 - recently novel GAG structures were found in a parasitic nematode
worm and relatively long GAG chains released by hydrazinolysis of C. elegans.
Sulphation is at a low level for C. elegans CS.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and we have
modified the discussion on the GAG structures in nematodes and sulfation level
in the text.
“The common tetrasaccharide core linking the repeating disaccharides and the
serine residue of the proteoglycan are reported as GlcA(ß1-3)Gal(ß1-3)Gal(ß1-
4)Xyl for chondroitin and heparan. Recently, novel GAG tetrasaccharide core
with additional galactose and phospohcholine modifications were reported for
the parasitic nematode Oesophagostomum dentatum. ”
Page 21: the authors ask about the reasons for glycosylation - as Varki wrote in
one review, no cell exists without surface sugars. Sugars confer heterogeneity
and mean you have many different forms of a single glycoprotein which mean
you can tune interactions and activities.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. We have revised
the sentence in the text.
“Glycosylation confers heterogeneity on glycoconjugates and finely tunes their
structures and functions.”
Appendix B
The authors have revised their summary of data on glycans in
invertebrates, especially Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. However,
there are some smaller points for revision.
Page 1, Line 18: not corrected - ‘on the model organismS’ (plural),
then spelling of Caenorhabditis (not Carno …)
Response: We are sorry that we missed the correction. Now the
corrections have been corrected.
Page 2, Line 3: ‘occurS’ - singular form of verb with ‘s’ on end.
Response: Correction has been made.
Page 4, Line 23: ‘phosphorYLcholine’ (also page 6, line 22; page 16,
line 6; page 18, line 9)
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction. Correction has been
made throughout.
Page 5, Line 1: ‘phosphoethANOLamine’ (also page 10, line 21 and
page 16, line 2)
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction. Correction has been
made throughout.
Page 10, Line 15: ‘addS’ - singular form of verb with ‘s’ on end.
Response: Correction has been made
Page 10, Line 22: italicise Vespula germanica
Response: Correction has been made
Page 12, Line 8: the introduced part of the sentence is not correct,
as Ichimaya et al did do in vitro assays on co-transfected Sf21 cells
to show activity. What is meant rather is that the TMTC-type
mannosyltransferases of CaZy family 105, not the POMT1/2 ones,
have not yet been assayed in Caenorhabditis & Drosophila. TMTC is
an alternative O-mannosylation pathway relevant to cadherins
rather than dystroglycan.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction. We have modified
the sentence in the text.
“Another type of O-mannosylation, such as for the cadherin superfamily,
depends on the TMTC-type mannosyltransferases for O-mannosylation,
however, their mannosyltransferase activity in Caenorhabditis and
Drosophila is yet to be proven.”
Page 13, Line 6: ‘O-GlcNAcylation can actually occur in the nucleus
and cytosol’
Response: We have revised the sentence.
Page 13, Line 14 - at end of paragraph add: ‘There is also an
extracellular form of O-GlcNAcylation on EGF repeats mediated by
the EOGT enzyme in the ER.” (e.g., review by Varshney & Stanley,
2017, Biochem Soc Trans).
Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have added the
sentence to the end of the graph and cited the relevant literature.
Page 15, Line 9 - ‘Glycosphingolipids in invertebrates’
Response: Revision has been made.
Page 15, Line 23: “In Drosophila, the core mactosyl Man(b1-4)Glc
structure”
Response: We have revised the sentence according to the reviewer’s
suggestion.
Page 16, Line 3 - ‘…phosphoNate’
Response: Correction has been made.
Page 16, Line 7 - “GSLs of the lepidopteran species Bombyx mori
were … but novel extensions were revealed.” (italicise Bomby mori)
Response: The sentence has been revised based on the reviewer’s
suggestion.
Page 16, Line 10 - as mactosyl ceramide is defined on page 15, no
need to define again.
Response: We have deleted the redundant description of the mactosyl
ceramide.
Page 17, Line 10 - ‘Glycosaminoglycans in invertebrates’
Response: We have revised the section title.
Page 17, Line 18 - “only heparan and chondroitin chains with or
without sulphate.”
Response: The sentence has been revised according to the reviewer’s
suggestion.
Page 17, Lines 19/20 - the sentence starting ‘Invertebrates’ repeats
the one at the end of the previous paragraph and so can be deleted.
Response: We have deleted the sentence.
Page 18, Line 8 - “heparan, 91, whereby the relevant enzymes
synthesising the core are encoded by genes defective in sqv
mutants” (here refer to Esko/Horvitz)
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. We have
added the sentence and cited the relevant paper.
Page 18, Line 18 - remove the sentences starting ‘for example’ and
‘the GAGs’ - instead write “As for Caenorhabditis, the GAGs in
Drosophila are based on the same canonical GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl core
for attachment to proteins; some of the relevant enzymes have been
characterised, such as oxt (Wilson, J Biol Chem , 2002) and GalT7
(Vadaie & Jarvis, J Biol Chem, 2002).
Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The original
sentences have been deleted and replaced by the sentence suggested
by the reviewer.
Page 19 - line 18 - can also add ‘or hydrazinolysis’
Response: The method “hydrazinolysis” has been added to the sentence.
Ref 41: ‘Guérardel’ (not with capital ÉR)
Response: Correction has been made.
Ref 82: not J Biol Chem but J Biochem (Tokyo)
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction. Correction has been
made.
Ref 84: italicise Drosophila and remove <em>
Response: correction has been made.
Table 1: For O-Fuc, no Gal in Drosophila, rather a branched
trisaccharide GlcA(GlcNAc)Fuc; also O-Man is probably not
extended. Suggest making all glycans scaled to same size of
monosaccharide.
Response: The O-Fuc and O-Man glycan structures in Table 1 have
been modified according to the reviewer’s suggestion. The glycans have
been sized roughly to the same scale.
Figure 1: the Volvarina structure is methylated on the unknown
antennal hexose.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the correction and have modified
the glycan structure in Figure 1.
Figure 2: First three Drosophila structures, the terminal HexNAc or
Hex are undefined (not necessarily GlcNAc or Gal); the sixth
structure should have no terminal Gal; the seventh/last structure are
fine if the undefined HexNAc would be sulphated.
Response: The Drosophila mucin type O-glycans in Figure 2 are from
reference 38, which have provided monosaccharide identity for these
structures. To be more inclusive, we replaced the terminal GlcNAc or Gal
by HexNAc or Hex as suggested by the reviewer.
