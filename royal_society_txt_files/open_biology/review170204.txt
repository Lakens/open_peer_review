This is an encyclopedic overview of the structure and biochemical function of the anaphase-
promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The article is remarkably thorough and
comprehensive, covering almost every detail and publication from the past two decades of
APC/C biochemistry and structure, with an emphasis on the groundbreaking cryo-EM studies
that have greatly expanded our understanding in the past few years. Given that the senior
author’s laboratory was responsible for most of these recent breakthroughs, the authors of this
review are in a strong position to write with authority and accuracy.
I have no major concerns about the accuracy or coverage of the content, and this review could
become the standard review of the topic for years to come. My only concern is that the review is
so thorough and detailed that non-specialist readers might find it difficult to see the key concepts.
Although the review is quite long, it is densely packed from start to finish. There are numerous
paragraphs that contain so many facts and literature citations that the underlying point is
obscured (one example is the full-page paragraph about APC/C-MCC structure on page 23). In
some cases, the solution to this problem might be to break things up into more digestible pieces,
and package the information in a more biological framework, although I appreciate that this will
make a long review even longer.

This is an excellent and supremely comprehensive review. The authors have managed to
summarise a large body of data in a coherent fashion, and they have been remarkably even-
handed in their analysis of the published literature. There are only a few places where the
authors' text could be clearer or corrections are required to the citations; these are listed below.
Overall, this is an exemplary summary.
Corrections:
P1, para 2: Note that Cyclin A is both an S phase and an M phase cyclin.
P2, para 1: Include a reference to the requirement for APC/C activity in mitotic exit in human
cells: only yeast and frogs are cited.
P2, para 2: The authors cite Rape and Kirschner as evidence that auto-ubiquitination of the E2
regulates APC/C activity (ref 37). For balance they may wish to cite Walker et al. 2008, J.Cell Sci
121, p2319 who presented data that this is incorrect.
P2, para 2: The authors should cite Machida and Dutta 2007, Genes Dev 21, p184 as additional
evidence that Emi1 inhibits the APC/C in interphase.
P6, paras 2 & 3: These are somewhat difficult to understand for the non-specialist
P10, para 2: Does the APC/C structure offer any insights into how the CRY box binds to the
APC/C?
P14, section 4.3: The Kirschner model of processive affinity amplification is somewhat
contentious. Are the authors endorsing this model?
P15, para 2: Note that there is evidence that the APC/C is active in meiotic prophase but in
somatic cells it appears to activated only in pro-metaphase.
P15, para 3: Note that Cyclin A degradation is not inhibited by the SAC but it is affected by the
SAC.
P16, para 2: It is not really appropriate to cite the Rape, Reddy and Kirschner paper (ref 185) with
reference to Cyclin A as a processive substrate since this paper was predicated on Cyclin A as an
example of a distributive substrate.
P17, para 1: Reference 119 only has data from budding yeast, which do not have Cyclin A.
P17, section 6.1: Note that after NEBD is defined as pro-metaphase not prophase.
P18, para 1: Cdh1 is inactivated through the combined actions of Cdk-dependent
phosphorylation and Emi1/Rca1.
P20, para 2: For clarity it would be better to say that APC/C-Cdc20 is activated by
phosphorylation rather than that Cdc20 is activated by phosphorylation.
P21, section 7: To give due credit, Rca1 was discovered before Emi1.
P22, section 8: The SAC is also known as the kinetochore checkpoint.
P22, para 3: It is perhaps overstating the case that the molecular mechanisms underlying how the
APC/C and the MCC reciprocally regulate each other were first defined by a series of
biochemical papers that appears before the structural papers. The structural papers beautifully
confirmed the mechanisms put forward in these papers but many of the principles were
previously proposed.
P26, para 2: The role of USP44 in the SAC is contentious. There is now unpublished evidence that
the effect of USP44 siRNA on the SAC was due to an off-target effect on Mad2.

Dear David,
Thank you for the referees’ comments on our review. We are grateful to the referees for taking the time to
review this article and for their positive comments and suggestions. We detail revisions below.
With best wishes,
Dr. David Barford
Reviewer #1
We thank the referee for the careful and thoughtful critic of the review. Our aim was to produce a
definitive and comprehensive review of the field. Hopefully interested readers will persevere. As
suggested, we have divided some of the long paragraphs in the APC/C-MCC section.
Reviewer #2
We thank the referee for the careful and thoughtful critic of the review. The suggestions and correction
were very helpful to ensure that this is an accurate and balanced review of the field.
Corrections:
P1, para 2: Note that Cyclin A is both an S phase and an M phase cyclin.
Corrected
P2, para 1: Include a reference to the requirement for APC/C activity in mitotic exit in human cells: only yeast
and frogs are cited.
New refs added:

when the APC/C switches from activation by Cdc20 to Cdh1. J Cell Biol, 2002. 157(7): p. 1125-37.

25. van Zon, W., et al., The APC/C recruits cyclin B1-Cdk1-Cks in prometaphase before D box
recognition to control mitotic exit. J Cell Biol, 2010. 190(4): p. 587-602.
P2, para 2: The authors cite Rape and Kirschner as evidence that auto-ubiquitination of the E2 regulates APC/C
activity (ref 37). For balance they may wish to cite Walker et al. 2008, J.Cell Sci 121, p2319 who presented
data that this is incorrect.
We deleted the Rape and Kirschner reference to avoid this controversial subject.
P2, para 2: The authors should cite Machida and Dutta 2007, Genes Dev 21, p184 as additional evidence that
Emi1 inhibits the APC/C in interphase.
Machida and Dutta 2007 now added.
P6, paras 2 & 3: These are somewhat difficult to understand for the non-specialist
Apologizes for that.
P10, para 2: Does the APC/C structure offer any insights into how the CRY box binds to the APC/C?
Thank you for the suggestion. Yes have added a sentence.
P14, section 4.3: The Kirschner model of processive affinity amplification is somewhat contentious. Are the
authors endorsing this model?
No, but we now rephrase this section to indicate that the binding of a substrate-conjugated ubiquitin to
the exosite on Apc11 would be consistent with the proposal (in the Kirschner model) that substrate
ubiquitination primes APC/C substrates for further ubiquitination.
P15, para 2: Note that there is evidence that the APC/C is active in meiotic prophase but in somatic cells it
appears to activated only in pro-metaphase.
Corrected
P15, para 3: Note that Cyclin A degradation is not inhibited by the SAC but it is affected by the SAC.
Corrected
P16, para 2: It is not really appropriate to cite the Rape, Reddy and Kirschner paper (ref 185) with reference to
Cyclin A as a processive substrate since this paper was predicated on Cyclin A as an example of a distributive
substrate.
Reference deleted.
P17, para 1: Reference 119 only has data from budding yeast, which do not have Cyclin A.
Reference deleted.
P17, section 6.1: Note that after NEBD is defined as pro-metaphase not prophase.
Corrected
P18, para 1: Cdh1 is inactivated through the combined actions of Cdk-dependent phosphorylation and
Emi1/Rca1.
2
Corrected
P20, para 2: For clarity it would be better to say that APC/C-Cdc20 is activated by phosphorylation rather than
that Cdc20 is activated by phosphorylation.
Corrected
P21, section 7: To give due credit, Rca1 was discovered before Emi1.
The text is altered to avoid mention of precedence of discovery.
P22, section 8: The SAC is also known as the kinetochore checkpoint.
Corrected
P22, para 3: It is perhaps overstating the case that the molecular mechanisms underlying how the APC/C and
the MCC reciprocally regulate each other were first defined by a series of biochemical papers that appears
before the structural papers. The structural papers beautifully confirmed the mechanisms put forward in these
papers but many of the principles were previously proposed.
This paragraph was intended to indicate that molecular mechanisms were explained, not that the
principles were derived. To clarify this the paragraph has been re-written:
The structural mechanisms underlying how the APC/C and the MCC are reciprocally regulated in the context
of the SAC were defined from cryo-EM reconstructions of APC/CCdc20 in complex with the MCC (APC/CMCC)
(Alfieri et al., 2016; Yamaguchi et al., 2016). These studies explained how the MCC blocks D-box and KEN-box
dependent substrates from interacting with APC/CCdc20, and also surprisingly revealed how the MCC interferes
with the initiating E2, UbcH10.
P26, para 2: The role of USP44 in the SAC is contentious. There is now unpublished evidence that the effect of
USP44 siRNA on the SAC was due to an off-target effect on Mad2.
We have retained reference to USP44 because we are not aware of the data in this unpublished study
and thus it should not take precedent over a published and refereed paper.
