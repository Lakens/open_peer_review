Wang et al. Investigate the mechanism of cell death involved in amine modified polyestyrene
particles. They show that lysosomal dysfunction is involved. This leads to LMP, autophagy
impairment and cell death.
This investigation is important because of the increasing use of NP in our dairy life. The study is
well conducted and it is publishable in Open biology. However this reviewer have several
concerns:
1) Fig 1 A: the authors said that lysosomes « dramatically expand » this is not obvious from the
picture. The lysosomal size should be measured and an statistic test should be performed to
evaluate differences of sizes
2) Fig 1 B : authors use PI in order to evaluate cell death. Used as described in materials and
methods this probe stains cells that have a permeable plasma membrane. Apoptotic cells are not
included. An apoptotic marker such annexin V should be used unless all the cell death induced
by these NP is necrotic-like. If this is the case authors should show it. This is very important
because LTG-/PI- cells are found.
3) I am quite skeptical about the use of Lysotrackers in FC, it is not recommended by Molecular
Probes because only a small amount is directed to the lysosome, se documentation at
https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp07525.pdf

merges blue/green, blue/red should help.
9) Fig 3B : the labeling of vesicles with HCQ is very different than the labeling of the treated cells.
How is this explained?
10) Fig 4 A : why LC3-I is not seen ?
11) I think a temporal course of inhibition instead a single point is important because autophagy
may switch from a pro-survival to a pro-cell death pathway.

Comments to the Author(s)
Wang et al. Investigate the mechanism of cell death involved in amine modified polyestyrene particles.
They show that lysosomal dysfunction is involved. This leads to LMP, autophagy impairment and cell
death.
This investigation is important because of the increasing use of NP in our dairy life. The study is well
conducted and it is publishable in Open biology. However this reviewer have several concerns:
1) Fig 1 A: the authors said that lysosomes « dramatically expand » this is not obvious from the
picture. The lysosomal size should be measured and a statistic test should be performed to evaluate
differences of sizes
We thank the referee for raising this point. We have now quantified lysosome size in at least 30 cells
per condition and analysed the significance of data. The results show that after 6h exposure to the NPs,
the sizes of lysosomes are significantly increased, compared with control untreated cells. We have
included this analysis in new Figure S1.
2) Fig 1 B : authors use PI in order to evaluate cell death. Used as described in materials and
methods this probe stains cells that have a permeable plasma membrane. Apoptotic cells are not
included. An apoptotic marker such annexin V should be used unless all the cell death induced by these
NP is necrotic-like. If this is the case authors should show it. This is very important because LTG-/PI-
cells are found.
This is an important point that deserves further attention. Indeed we have done some analysis with
Annexin V/PI staining (now added as new Figure S7). Even after 8 h treatment with these NPs, we have
observed that only 7% cells show exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer membrane (Annexin
V+/PI-), an early apoptotic event. We have previously characterised in more details the kinetics of the
apoptotic response to the same NPs in in 1321N1 cells. In agreements with the results added in Figure
S7 In MEF cells, we observed previously in 1321N1 cells that apoptotic events, such as exposure of PS
to outer plasma membrane and activation of caspase 3/7, occur as rather downstream events (6-8h) (see
Annexin V/PI full kinetics in Figure 1&S6, Wang et al., 2013, Nanoscale; and see caspase 3/7 kinetics
in Figure 3B, Bexiga et al., 2011, Nanotoxicology). This is because apoptosis occurs as a consequence
of the damage to the lysosomes upon NP accumulation and release of the lysosomal content in the
cytosol. Because of all this, the LMP detected at 3h is likely to be upstream of all cell death events. It
is unlikely that the LTG-/PI- cells after 3h exposure to NPs correspond to apoptotic cells in MEF cells,
but they would eventually become apoptotic at later time points.
3) I am quite skeptical about the use of Lysotrackers in FC, it is not recommended by Molecular
Probes because only a small amount is directed to the lysosome, se documentation at
https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp07525.pdf
We totally agree with the referee that we need to be cautious with the use of LysoTracker in FC and
that LysoTracker alone cannot be used to demonstrate increase in lysosomal volume or LMP. We have
only used it as an indicative parameter to assess, at a first level, changes in intensity upon exposure to
nanoparticles. Other experiments are needed to fully demonstrate whether observed changes in
LysoTracker in FC are due to changes in lysosomal volume or LMP. For these reasons, we have
combined the LysoTracker results with additional experiments. More precisely, to prove whether the
observed increase in LysoTracker was due an increase in lysosomal volume, we have used confocal
fluorescence imaging (Figure 1A, 3A and new S1). To determine whether loss of LysoTracker intensity
was due to LMP, we have used cell fractionation to detect release of lysosomal content in cytosol
(Figure 2A). We have also mentioned in the Discussion that “Our data support that detecting lysosomal
content in the cytosol is probably the best way to analyse LMP” (Page 12). We have now added in the
same paragraph (Page 12) that caution needs to be taken when using LysoTracker alone to assess
lysosomal alterations.
4) The use of pepstatin A is a little disturbing because this compound does not cross the PM very
efficiently (DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.09.114). This may explain its lack of inhibition. The authors
should do the experience using Methyl ester derivatives.
We thank the referee for this remark. We are also aware that the transport of pepstatin A to lysosome
could be inefficient. We have therefore performed a 16h pre-treatment of pepstatin A (50 µM) prior to
exposure to NPs as described in the Methods and Materials. Similar usage of pepstatin A can be find in
various literature, for example overnight pre-treatment of 50 µM pepstatin A in Droga-Mazovec et al.,
2008 (doi: 10.1074/jbc.M802513200), and 24h pre-treatment of 50 µM pepstatin A in Amritraj et al.,
2013 (doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.412460). When used at similar conditions, there are cases where
inhibition of cathepsin D with pepstatin A was effective. For example, in Castino et al., 2007
(10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.12.030), the authors show that inhibition of cathepsin D by pepstatin A
(with 12 h pre-treatment at 100 µM, similar to our treatment), but not cathepsin B, could retard cell
death. However we have included the possibility that pepstatin A might be inefficient in our revised
manuscript. (Section 1.3)
5) Concerning cell death inhibition it is surprising to see that although E64 inhibits cell death, the
inhibitory effect is lost in the presence of pepstatin A. The authors should explain this inconsistency.
As it is well documented in literature, pepstatin A and E64d are used together to inhibit autophagy at
similar concentrations as in our study (Kaizuka et al., 2016, doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.09.037).
Therefore, we need to take into account their summary inhibitory effect on autophagy when both
inhibitors are present. As autophagy is a cell surviving mechanism in our system (Section 2.3; Figure
4C). It is logical that when both inhibitors are present, the inhibitory effect on cell death is lost compared
with E64d alone (specific for cathespin B). We apologize that this result does not add any new
information and it is confusing for the readers, so we have decided to remove it (See new Figure 2).
6) The increase in ROS found complicate the interpretation of the data. Is there a direct
involvement of mitochondria? I think the authors should study the mitochondrial potential in order to
elucidate this point.
We thank this Reviewer for this comment. Indeed, mitochondria are involved in the cellular toxicity
induced by these NPs. In the revised manuscript we have added a supplementary figure (new Figure
S8), with TEM images of mitochondria before and after NP treatment. They show clearly that there is
loss of mitochondria cristae after 8h NP treatment, indicative of mitochondrial damage in MEF cells.
Furthermore, we have previously examined in details the status of mitochondria after exposure to the
same NPs in 1321N1 cells (Figure 1 and S5, Wang et al., 2013, Nanoscale; Figure 1). By performing a
time resolved study on ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential and lysosomal alterations,
we have shown that the damage to mitochondria is a downstream event after the lysosomal alterations
induced by these NPs and release of lysosomal content in the cytosol. Loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential is observed only after 8h exposure to the NPs. Furthermore, addition of lysosomal protease
inhibitors could decrease ROS generation and caspase 3/7 level (Figure S9, Wang et al., 2013,
Nanoscale), further suggesting that ROS are generated as a consequence of lysosomal content release
in the cytosol. We have expanded on this point in Section 1.3 and also in the Discussion section of the
revised manuscript.
7) The protection induced by DFO indicates that Fe is involved in this cell death. Is it possible to
talk about Ferroptosis? The authors should discuss this point.
We thank the referee for this very insightful suggestion. We also think that the DFO-sensitive ROS
could be related to ferroptosis, which could lead to a new chapter of research related to these cationic
NPs. We have now added some discussion on ferroptosis in the Discussion part (page 12).
8) Fig 3A it is not clear whether the NP are into lysosomes or autophagosomes, I think separated
merges blue/green, blue/red should help.
We agree with the referee that the overlay of only two colours could improve visualization. Now we
have therefore separately merged blue/green, blue/red and green/red, and we have added all the different
merges in the supplementary figure (Figure S9) with arrows indicating colocalizations. We chose to
place it in the supplementary for the reason of presentation, as there is limited place in the main figure.
We have described the results in the figure legend.
9) Fig 3B: the labeling of vesicles with HCQ is very different than the labeling of the treated cells.
How is this explained?
The main purpose of the comparison with HCQ is to show that both HCQ and NP treatment result in
accumulation of yellow structures, namely autophagosomes (as both GFP and RFP are present),
suggesting block of autophagy.
HCQ is known to induce lysosomal dilatation and downstream block of autophagy (Yoon et al., 2010,
doi: 10.1167/iovs.10-5278). This positive control is to show that when autophagy is blocked at the
lysosomal level, autophagosomes accumulate (labelled as yellow since both GFP and RFP are present)
and are not being degraded. The treatment with the NPs for 8h shows the same phenotype as observed
with HCQ (with many yellow structures), suggesting that also the NPs induce block of autophagy.
We apologize if the previous images were confusing. In the revised version, we have zoomed our
images and selected a new representative image to better show the yellow structures which indicate in
both cases block of autophagy.
10) Fig 4 A : why LC3-I is not seen ?
Quoting from Mizushima & Yoshimori, 2007, “LC3-II tends to be more sensitive than LC3-I in
immunoblotting”. We had to overexpose the blot in order to detect LC3-I. This overexposed image was
included in Figure S10C.
11) I think a temporal course of inhibition instead a single point is important because autophagy
may switch from a pro-survival to a pro-cell death pathway.
We thank the referee for this remark. We have now performed the experiment at an earlier time (8h
treatment of NPs). The data show a very similar result as 24h indicating that autophagy is also a pro-
survival at earlier times. This additional experiment is now added in Supplementary Figure S11.

Comments to the Author(s)
Thanks for submitting this interesting research paper. The paper is well-written and interesting for the
ield of nanotoxicology. The authors have done great efforts in providing additional information for the
eviewers concerns. I would recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
We thank the reviewer for the very positive comment on our work.
1. Figure S1 gives a quantification of the lysosomal size upon nanoparticle treatment. Little information
s provided how this data was quantified using ImageJ. What is the lysosomal size? Is it the area, section?
Was it measured manually or was a certain plug-in used to put thresholds etc? Is the data normalized
per cell? Is there a relation between the number of lysosomes and nanoparticle treatment?
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We apologize for not having provided more details in the last
version of our manuscript. The lysosomal size is the diameter (in µm) of lysosomes measured manually
ollowing the documentation of ImageJ. We have now added an image (Figure S1A) to explain the
measurement and adjusted the name of the Y axis from “size” to “diameter”. The data is the mean value
of the diameters of lysosomes from 30-50 cells. To evaluate whether there is a relation between the
number of lysosomes and nanoparticle treatment, we have counted the number of lysosomes of 30-50
cells and plotted them in Figure S1D. The data show there is no significant differences between the
number of lysosomes after NP treatment. In all, we have adjusted the figure legend accordingly.
2. In Figure 2 ROS production was determined after nanoparticle exposure. The data could be further
mproved by showing the distributions of the H2CFDA staining. Interesting to see if all cells respond in
a similar way or if subpopulations are detectable.
This is indeed a very pertinent suggestion. We have now included the distributions of the CM-
H2DCFDA staining in the new Figure S8. Most of the cells show a homogenous increase of ROS
production after 8h exposure to NPs. However, there is a small population (around 9%) with lower ROS
production and show lower FS (ROS low population) in the plot of SS Lin vs FS Lin. They are likely
he same cells that show Annexin V+/PI+ in Figure S7, which are also around 10% of cell population.
They are the cells at the stage of late apoptosis/necrosis.
