This is an interesting study with novel findings. The regulatory role of MALAT1 in gastric
adenocarcinoma was well elucidated. First, the authors found that MALAT1 was highly
expressed in the serum of gastric adenocarcinoma patients and cell lines. Second, down-
regulating MALAT1 was able to inhibit the proliferation and promoted apoptosis in MGC-803
cells. Third, MALAT1 was found to directly target miR-181a-5p and decreased the expression of
miR-181a-5p, therefore upregulate the expression of AKT3. Last, overexpressing miR-181a-5p or
directly inhibiting the AKT pathway with an inhibitor Ipatasertib exhibited similar effects as
MALAT1 knockdown. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that MALAT1 competes
with AKT3 for miR-181a binding, thereby up-regulating AKT3 protein level and ultimately
promoting the growth of gastric adenocarcinoma. These results deserve publication, giving my
following concerns could be addressed.
1. The rational to study MALAT1 is not cleary explained. Need more background information,
especially in the tumor field.
2. It is better not to include the results and the significance in the introduction section (the last
para. in this section).
3. Any informed consents from the participants? This needs to be clarified.
4. The time point to conduct the CCK-8 assay needs to be indicated.
5. Figure legends should be carefully revised. There are some unidentified characters, and the
presentation is poor.
6. Why I can not see any error bars in some set of the data in figure 3 and 6?
7. It is preferred to re-arrange the subfigures in Figure 5, especially for the WB image. It looks too
small in this figure.

Major comments:
1. In the results section, the authors mentioned that MALAT1 is highly expressed in gastric
adenocarcinoma patients. Yet they only showed that serum MALAT1 level is higher in gastric
adenocarcinoma patients compared to healthy control. Why didn't they compare the expression
in tumor and adjacent normal tissue as well?
2. The authors should also show the clinical parameter between the two groups of samples, such
as age, gender, and use statistical analysis to determine if the serum level of MALAT1 was
affected by these parameters.
3. The authors should include more cell-lines of gastric normal and adenocarcinoma cell-line for
comparing their MALAT1 levels.
4. More details are needed for the following parts:
What bioinformatic methods did the authors use to predict the possible binding targets between
MALAT1 and miR-181a-5p/miR-181a-5p and AKT3?
How were MALAT1 and miR-181a-5p level knocked down?
Did the authors use GAPDH as normalization for lncRNA and miRNA? Why?
5. The expression of miR-181a-5p was negatively correlated with the expression of MALAT1,
hence the R2 value should be negative.
6. No evidence showing direct interaction between MALAT1 and miR-181a-5p/miR-181a-5p and
AKT3. Why was luciferase reporter assay not performed? I think the luciferase reporter assay is
important to draw the conclusion "Our data further indicates that MALAT1 competitively binds
to miR-181a, making miR-181a unable to bind to AKT3 mRNA, thereby up-regulating AKT3
protein levels and ultimately promoting tumor growth".
7. The authors had used miR-181, miR-181a and miR-181a-5p in the manuscript. If they are
talking about miR-181a-5p in all occasions, miR-181a-5p should be used consistently.
8. Ipatasertib is an inhibitor of Akt pathway, but not specific for Akt3. I think siRNA against Akt3
should be used instead of Ipatasertib.
9. To show that MALAT1 promoted gastric adenocarcinoma a through MALAT1-miR-181a-AKT3
axis, the functional effect of MALAT1 overexpression with or without transfection of miR-181a-
5p or Akt3 siRNA will be a more direct evidence.
10. Some words in figure legend are not displayed appropriately. Figure legend of figure 6
should be A and B.
11. There are some minor grammatical errors.

following concerns could be addressed.
1.The rational to study MALAT1 is not cleary explained. Need more background
information, especially in the tumor field.
Response:
Thanks for the comments. We have added more background information of the function
of MALAT1 in the tumor field.
2. It is better not to include the results and the significance in the introduction section
(the last para. in this section).
Response:
We have removed results and significance from the introduction part.
3. Any informed consents from the participants? This needs to be clarified.
Response:
Yes, informed consent was derived from each participant, which was specified in the
original paper (patients and samples section).
4. The time point to conduct the CCK-8 assay needs to be indicated.
Response:
We have added this information in the figure legends.
5. Figure legends should be carefully revised. There are some unidentified characters,
and the presentation is poor.
Response:
We have revised the figure legends and made the correction.
6. Why I can not see any error bars in some set of the data in figure 3 and 6?
Response:
In fact all points have an error bar, but the error bar for some points is too small to show
up proportionally in the figure.
7. It is preferred to re-arrange the subfigures in Figure 5, especially for the WB image.

Comments to the Author(s)
Major comments:
1. In the results section, the authors mentioned that MALAT1 is highly expressed in
gastric adenocarcinoma patients. Yet they only showed that serum MALAT1 level is
higher in gastric adenocarcinoma patients compared to healthy control. Why didn't they
compare the expression in tumor and adjacent normal tissue as well?
Response:
It is indeed a better choice to use cancerous tissue and adjacent tissues. But we don't
have these samples. We only found serum samples in the sample library. At that time,
these samples did not have corresponding tissue samples, so we can only compare the
expression levels of MALAT1 in the serum of patients and normal healthy controls.
2. The authors should also show the clinical parameter between the two groups of
samples, such as age, gender, and use statistical analysis to determine if the serum level
of MALAT1 was affected by these parameters.
Response:
We have provided the clinical parameters in FigureS1 and the results showed the
expression of MALAT1 was not affected by age or gender.
3. The authors should include more cell-lines of gastric normal and adenocarcinoma
cell-line for comparing their MALAT1 levels.
Response:
We have added two more cell lines in FigureS2. The results showed that the expression
level of MALAT1 was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma cell-lines than that in
gastric normal cell lines.
4. More details are needed for the following parts:
What bioinformatic methods did the authors use to predict the possible binding targets
between MALAT1 and miR-181a-5p/miR-181a-5p and AKT3?
How were MALAT1 and miR-181a-5p level knocked down?
Did the authors use GAPDH as normalization for lncRNA and miRNA? Why?
Response:
The interaction between lncRNA and miRNA was predicted by online tool
http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/index.php, and the miRNA target prediction was performed
by the online tool http://www.targetscan.org/vert_72/.
Details of how we knocked down MALAT1 and overexpressed miR-181a-5p was
added to the method part.
We used U6 snRNA as the internal control for lncRNA and miRNA, since this is a
common choice and it works well in our hands. This information has been updated in
the revised “QRT-PCR analysis” section.
5. The expression of miR-181a-5p was negatively correlated with the expression of
MALAT1, hence the R2 value should be negative.
Response:
The expression of miR-181a-5p was negatively correlated with the expression of
MALAT1, therefore, r should be negative. However, R2 (square of R) should always
be positive.
6. No evidence showing direct interaction between MALAT1 and miR-181a-5p/miR-
181a-5p and AKT3. Why was luciferase reporter assay not performed? I think the
luciferase reporter assay is important to draw the conclusion "Our data further indicates
that MALAT1 competitively binds to miR-181a, making miR-181a unable to bind to
AKT3 mRNA, thereby up-regulating AKT3 protein levels and ultimately promoting
tumor growth".
Response:
You are absolutely right. We performed the luciferase reporter assay as you suggested
and presented the results in Figure S3.
7. The authors had used miR-181, miR-181a and miR-181a-5p in the manuscript. If
they are talking about miR-181a-5p in all occasions, miR-181a-5p should be used
consistently.
Response:
We unified this term as miR-181a-5p in all the figures, figure legends and the text.
8. Ipatasertib is an inhibitor of Akt pathway, but not specific for Akt3. I think siRNA
against Akt3 should be used instead of Ipatasertib.
Response:
That is a good point. First, we actually did try the siRNA against Akt3, but the knock
down efficiency was very poor. Second, the usage of inhibitors and direct knockdown
is a completely different effect. The inhibitor only affects its function and does not
affect its expression, although there will be some non-specific conditions. However,
knockdown directly changes the amount of protein expressed, which may have a more
serious impact.
9. To show that MALAT1 promoted gastric adenocarcinoma a through MALAT1-miR-
181a-AKT3 axis, the functional effect of MALAT1 overexpression with or without
transfection of miR-181a-5p or Akt3 siRNA will be a more direct evidence.
Response:
It is a good point. We initially tried to over express MALAT1, which is frustrating. If
a small amount of overexpression does not significantly increase the expression level
of MALAT1, if the expression level is increased, the state of the cells will be affected,
and the cells will tend to apoptosis, so we are still trying with different experimental
conditions
10. Some words in figure legend are not displayed appropriately. Figure legend of
figure 6 should be A and B.
Response:
We have revised the figure legends and made the correction, and also re-arranged the
subfigures in Figure 5 according to your suggestion.
11. There are some minor grammatical errors.
Response:
Thanks for the comments. We have revised the manuscript for grammatical errors.
