This is the follow-up to three previous influential papers published by
Professor Gazit’s group (Nature Chemical Biology, 2012; Nature
Communications, 2016; J. Inhererit Metabolism Dis., 2016). These papers
opened new avenues in the understanding of the origin of diseases secondary
to amyloid formation. In the present manuscript, of particular interest is
the focus on non-protein and even non-amino acid entities that can form
amyloid structures. It presents quite a novel view concerning the
accumulation of metabolites that promote the initial nucleation of the
deposits, and trigger the amyloidogenic cascade leading to the premature
formation of abnormal molecular assemblies.
I believe that the publication of this article will be of great importance
for scientists dealing with pathologies arising from misfolded proteins.

Comments:
The title is misleading. The last figure#2 is also misleading. Cross-seeding event is very limited in
literature and whatever the evidence we see is mostly under in vitro systems. This cannot be
extrapolated to propose the hypothesis that amyloid cross-seeding is the common mechanism
behind pathologies like cancer and degenerative diseases. Amyloid cross-seeding cannot be
always related to the accumulation of metabolites though some research reports have
experimentally shown for aromatic Phe residues. Discussing about these experimentally proven
metabolite aggregation is fine and must be elaborated.
Few concerns that authors must consider addressing.
Even though authors mention about the accumulation of metabolites under diseased conditions,
it is difficult to extrapolate that these elevated accumulation will always lead to the formation of
amyloid aggregates which would further enable the formed amyloids to cross-seed other
proteins, leading to loss of functional proteins and gain of toxic amyloids. Where is the
experimental evidence for this hypothesis? For PKU it may be true, but not for all. Hence the
concept of cross-seeding that this paper talks about must be limited to PKU or other similar
reported pathologies.
Such sequential events (metabolite accumulation-to-amyloid formation-to-cross-seeding) may be
true for Phe, as experimentally shown that it forms cytotoxic amyloid fibrils (from the author’s
group) and also Phe-fibrils can cross seed proteins (from reference 24 of this manuscript, Sci
Report 2017). However, this may not be true for the accumulation of all types of metabolites.
Hence, brining in the concept of accumulation of metabolites leading to amyloid aggregation and
cross seeding, and proposing this event as a common-mechanism for different pathologies
including cancer is certainly misleading.
For example, cells do respond to aggregation-inducing conditions by increasing specific
metabolite concentrations: Good example is the rise in the concentration of proline, even in the
range of 2-3M, under stress conditions. Same for betaine and trehalose etc. This observation is
fundamental to biological systems. Also, proline itself has been reported to undergo self-
assembly and form higher order structures, not amyloid like (J. of solution chemistry 2015, vol 44
pp 45-53). But proline accumulation is considered as beneficial and protective against stress-
induced protein aggregation. Other best examples, as I mentioned are accumulation of trehalose,
betaine, (many natural osmolytes). David Eisenberg’s paper on functional amyloid granules
(published in Science) also suggests that amyloid formation can be beneficial.
Abeta-fibrils already shown to cross-seed amyloid aggregation of BSA (The Journal of
Biochemistry 2016 vol 160, pp325). A recent work has shown that protein amyloids can also cross
seed other proteins (Biochemistry 2014 vol53, pp8001 ). Hence the cross seeding is not restricted
to only metabolite aggregates as the authors are trying to emphasize. Protein amyloids may be
capable of cross-seeding. Many clinical reports have also revealed two amyloid diseases in the
same individual. Authors should discuss these reports when they are trying to focus on amyloid
cross-seeding.
More importantly, it (metabolite accumulation leading to amyloid formation) may be true for
aromatic metabolites, such as Trp, Phe and Tyr etc. and I appreciate the mentioning of these
accumulation by the authors. The focus on aromatic metabolites, particularly those that have
4
been shown to form amyloid like structures, experimentally, should be discussed only. The
authors should also mention that the aggregation of all these aromatic metabolites is not possible
only in physiological conditions, rather most metabolite aggregation as I learnt from the
published papers involve high concentration and conditions of elevated temperature that too in
some cases the aggregates are formed by heating and slow cooling of the metabolite samples
(Reference 12). It is very important to mention about these non-physiological aggregation
conditions for some metabolites in this review. Otherwise it reads as every metabolite forms
amyloid aggregates under physiological conditions.
Authors must take into consideration that cell compartment is a very complex system with the
various biomolecules in the same environment, maintaining a homeostasis among metabolite
levels. It is difficult to propose that accumulated metabolites will only form amyloids which can
cross-seed proteins. What about arginine? Arginine is known to strongly protect amyloid
aggregation of proteins. Solid evidences both in vivo and in vitro studies are essential to the
proposed the hypothesis, particularly on common amyloid cross seeding, that the authors are
claiming in the review.
One more important aspect the authors must discuss is the amyloid cross seeding among proteins
as shown recently (The Journal of Biochemistry 2016 vol 160, pp325, Biochemistry 2014). So my
point is not all the metabolite accumulation will lead to amyloid aggregation. It may vary from
metabolite to metabolite. Some accumulation may be protective. Each metabolite is linked to
many important biochemical reactions in the cellular events. Hence increase in the concentration
of the metabolite may affect the equilibrium of the vital biochemical reactions that may affect the
cell normalcy, leading to severities. Hence accumulation, or rise in the concentration of any
metabolite itself can be lethal even without forming amyloid aggregates.
P53 aggregation has been reported and authors try to propose that this event is due to the
amyloid cross-seeding without any direct or indirect research reports on this. The accumulation
of the metabolites in cancer cells, as authors describe, does not make sense to this reviewer when
they correlated it to amyloid cross-seeding.
Page 8, line 175…
We hypothesize that excess QA accumulation may lead to metabolite amyloid-like fibrils
formation, which cannot be degraded by QPRTase. The putative QA fibrils co-localize with
aggregated endogenous proteins such as tau, and may serve as a seed to increase further
aggregation of aggregation-prone proteins (Figure 2)……
One way, the authors are proposing common amyloid cross-seeding behind this (above
statement). Now the question is do we know whether QA can form amyloid structures under
physiological concentration and buffer conditions. As of now, we do not know. Secondly,
assuming that QA forms amyloids, Is cross-seeding specific to p53. If we believe the experimental
evidences of cross-seeding (as shown in ref 24) Phe-amyloid’s cross-seeding ability is not protein
specific. Hence, the QA accumulation in the cytosol may possibly be capable of cross-seeding
unrelated proteins, not only the p53. So, unless one proves that QA can aggregate and QA
aggregates can specifically drive aggregation of p53, the proposed statement in the manuscript
can mislead the readers. Further, the concept amyloid-cross seeding for p53 aggregation is not
clear as well. If the metabolite aggregates and forms toxic amyloids in tumorigenic cells, would
not it trigger apoptotic death in cells due to the same reasons that the author are describing (ref
no 12), two critical consequences: i.,e., the loss of protein function and toxic gain of functions. By
the same logic it may help in the killing of cancerous cells, not converting them into tumerogenic
cells.
Hence the amyloid aggregation of aromatic metabolites must be discussed and at the same time
the accumulation of other metabolites and their identified functions can be discussed. However
the manuscript must not generalize the accumulation of metabolites would lead to amyloid fibrils
as a universal event.
Finally, the concept of the cross seeding is very new and must be carefully discussed with
limitations according to available research reports such as the case of PKU. Accumulation of
metabolites in diseases is also very informative and must be discussed as such, without
5
unnecessarily linking to amyloid cross-seeding. Information regarding what types of metabolites
accumulate in which types diseases is very helpful. At the same time, linking amyloid formation
of such metabolites to the disease mechanism is misleading, without direct or indirect
experimental evidences.
The authors must discuss about amyloid formation of the metabolites if it has been reported so.
The concept of cross-seeding is not only restricted to metabolite-amyloids. As we have seen in
recent reports that amyloid of one type of protein can cross-seed other proteins. There are reports
that inclusions can also trap proteins with intrinsically disordered stretches in their structures. So,
it is possible that protein amyloids can trap metabolites into aggregated structures. In such case it
would lower certain metabolite concentration. Would not that affect the normal physiology?
All the above mentioned points must be clarified in the revised manuscript.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_3
The authors address an important aspect associated with biochemical pathways that has been so
far specifically overlooked. The maintenance of metabolic homeostasis is an important part of
cellular physiology. However, how this is maintained in health and disease is not very well
explored and discussed in the literature. A very interesting concept presented in this review is the
seeding of metabolites into ordered amyloid like assemblies. Since growing literature has pointed
6
towards the dysregulation of metabolism in both neurodegeneration and cancer, and associated
scattered epidemiological inferences, this review will prove to be a significant consolidation of
how metabolite assemblies can affect and seed proteins into amyloid like assemblies, thus
triggering disease. It is suggested that metabolite accumulation and molecular self assembly
could be early events in the cascade leading to neurodegeneration. It indeed provides a new
paradigm for further experimental studies, and will provide an alternative outlook to the
underlying cause of disease.
The paper is well written, and I am impressed by the associations that have been clarified
regarding metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration and cancer. I strongly recommend this paper
for publication in Open Biology after having addressed minor comments/revisions mentioned
below.
1. Line 54: Interference in a given metabolic process can lead to deficiencies or accumulation of
metabolites (the authors have made this claim; is there any literature supporting this; could you
briefly explain in the text what could be the sources of this interference?)
2. Line 58 and 59: maybe a good idea to mention primary metabolites, especially so since you
have also mentioned secondary metabolites.
3. Would it be relevant to comment on the physiological concentrations of metabolites (where
available). These concentrations have been mentioned in the text for metabolic disorders.
However, these are not mentioned for all the metabolites implicated in neurodegeneration and
cancer. Perhaps, you could insert in the table an extra column of normal concentrations vs.
abnormal concentrations (where available). This data will be useful for the reader who wishes to
cite this review.
Dopamine is mentioned in the text, but not in the table. Any specific reasons for the same?

ments:
he title is misleading. The last figure#2 is also misleading. Cross-seeding event is very limited in
ature and whatever the evidence we see is mostly under in vitro systems. This cannot be
apolated to propose the hypothesis that amyloid cross-seeding is the common mechanism behind

accumulation of metabolites though some research reports have experimentally shown for
matic Phe residues. Discussing about these experimentally proven metabolite aggregation is fine
must be elaborated.
ponse: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. In this manuscript, that was submitted as
pectives paper rather than a review, we suggested cross-seeding of proteins by metabolites
loids as a possible mechanistic insight that may explain part of the pathologies reported in IEM
rders and ailments such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Our hypothesis is based on the
onstrated ability of metabolites (not only aromatic, references 12,16) to form amyloid-like
ctures as well as on resent reports demonstrating that metabolites (Phenylalanine, homogentisic
, references 24,25) could cross-seed proteins. We emphasized that this hypothesis should be tested
erimentally to assess the possible link and noted specific metabolites that were extensively
ciated with other human diseases. However, we agree that some expressions in the manuscript can
ore precise and we accepted the reviewer comment regarding the title of the manuscript.
avoid any misunderstanding, we changed the title to:" Seeding of proteins into amyloid structures
metabolite assemblies may clarify certain unexplained epidemiological associations"
revised the manuscript accordingly (page 5; line 122): "Structure formation and cross-seeding of
eins may be a possible mechanism in which accumulated metabolites interfere with protein
tion and folding."
e 7; line 149): "We suggest metabolite assembly and cross-seeding following accumulation as a
amental mechanism that might explain some unidentified epidemiological aspects associated with
ological conditions (Figure 2)."
added a headline and revised the legend of figure 2 (page 26; line 115):" Figure 2: Metabolite
ing hypothesis. A schematic putative model for the seeding of proteins by metabolites
mblies."
ven though authors mention about the accumulation of metabolites under diseased conditions, it
fficult to extrapolate that these elevated accumulation will always lead to the formation of amyloid
regates which would further enable the formed amyloids to cross-seed other proteins, leading to
of functional proteins and gain of toxic amyloids. Where is the experimental evidence for this
othesis? For PKU it may be true, but not for all. Hence the concept of cross-seeding that this paper
s about must be limited to PKU or other similar reported pathologies. Such sequential events
tabolite accumulation-to-amyloid formation-to-cross-seeding) may be true for Phe, as
erimentally shown that it forms cytotoxic amyloid fibrils (from the author’s group) and also Phe-
ls can cross seed proteins (from reference 24 of this manuscript, Sci Report 2017). However, this
not be true for the accumulation of all types of metabolites. Hence, brining in the concept of
umulation of metabolites leading to amyloid aggregation and cross seeding, and proposing this
t as a common-mechanism for different pathologies including cancer is certainly misleading.
ponse: We thank the reviewer for these comments. We agree that metabolite accumulation will not
ays lead to the formation of metabolite assemblies, toxicity and cross-seeding of proteins. We
gest this as a hypothesis that need to be further examined, and that can explain some of the
ologies in IEM disorders, neurodegeneration and cancer. Our hypothesis is based on different
erimental evidence: (i) Structure formation and cytotoxicity of many metabolites, not only Phe and
only aromatic (reference 12, 16). (ii) The ability of Phe and homogentisic acid to cross-seed non-
loidogenic or amyloidogenic proteins (references 24, 25). (iii) The accumulation of Quinolinic
in amyloid plaques and its effect on tau protein and Aß aggregation (references 29,30,33,34). (iiii)
accumulation of homocysteine and its cytotoxicity effect on hippocampal and cortical neurons as
as binding and stimulating a ß-sheet structure formation of Aß40 (references 35,36,55–57).
refore, the biological effect of these metabolites on related pathological proteins was already
onstrated, but was not attributed to their structure formation and cross-seeding. We agree that this
not be true for all types of metabolites and should be further tested.
is emphasized in the manuscript (page 8; line 173): "We hypothesize that excess QA accumulation
lead to metabolite amyloid-like fibril formation, which cannot be degraded by QPRTase. The
tive QA fibrils co-localize with aggregated endogenous proteins such as tau, and may serve as a
to increase further aggregation of aggregation-prone proteins (Figure 2)."
e 8; line 191): "We speculate that Hcy might undergo fibril formation and induce the seeding of
polypeptide resulting in plaque formation (Figure 2)."
e 9; line 201): "Taken together, the metabolite seeding hypothesis (Figure 2) should be tested
erimentally to assess the possible link."
arding oncometabolites, several molecules have been suggested to promote malignancy upon
mulation and to alter the activity of proteins and transcription factors (references 40-42). We
othesize that an interference by seeding of tumor suppressor proteins may be the link between
ometabolite accumulation and malignancy. We suggested p53 and VHL as aggregation-prone
eins to be further examined for the possibility to be seeded by metabolites assemblies. This may
ain the high occurrence of some cancer types in IEMs.
example, cells do respond to aggregation-inducing conditions by increasing specific metabolite
centrations: Good example is the rise in the concentration of proline, even in the range of 2-3M,
er stress conditions. Same for betaine and trehalose etc. This observation is fundamental to
ogical systems. Also, proline itself has been reported to undergo self-assembly and form higher
er structures, not amyloid like (J. of solution chemistry 2015, vol 44 pp 45-53). But proline
umulation is considered as beneficial and protective against stress-induced protein aggregation.
er best examples, as I mentioned are accumulation of trehalose, betaine, (many natural osmolytes).
id Eisenberg’s paper on functional amyloid granules (published in Science) also suggests that
loid formation can be beneficial.
ponse: We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point. We understand that metabolites
mulation that is not toxic is possible, and may be induced in cells under stress conditions.
ording with the studies demonstrating proline accumulation as protective, there are also studies
ribing proline accumulation in humans as a pathological state, termed hyperprolinemia, a
dition characterized by high plasma proline levels, seizures and mental retardation (Jacquet, H. et
Molecular Psychiatry, 2005). We believe that the effect of specific metabolite accumulation is
able between different organs and tissues. We did not mention in the manuscript that all
abolites, such as simple aliphatic or sugars can go through self-assembly and cause seeding of
eins.
l17 amyloid, which was studied in David Eisenberg’s paper, is the only functional amyloid that
been reported in mammals. Pmel17 is involved in mammalian skin pigmentation that can
ribute to normal cell and tissue physiology. This role of Pmel17 does not contradict our hypothesis
e many evidences also support the notion of pathological amyloids (e.g., a-synuclein, tau,
tingtin, TDP-43) which causes loss of function of neuronal proteins upon aggregation and an
ease in their cellular toxicity as well as self and cross seeding.
beta-fibrils already shown to cross-seed amyloid aggregation of BSA (The Journal of Biochemistry
6 vol 160, pp325). A recent work has shown that protein amyloids can also cross seed other
eins (Biochemistry 2014 vol53, pp8001). Hence the cross seeding is not restricted to only
abolite aggregates as the authors are trying to emphasize. Protein amyloids may be capable of
s-seeding. Many clinical reports have also revealed two amyloid diseases in the same individual.
hors should discuss these reports when they are trying to focus on amyloid cross-seeding.
ponse: We are grateful to the reviewer for the comment. Although we never mentioned that cross-
ing is limited to metabolite assemblies, we should discuss self and cross-seeding of proteins by
ein amyloids.
revised the manuscript accordingly and added the suggested references (page 5; line 115):" Self-
cross-seeding of proteins by amyloid assemblies is well established in the literature [26,27] and
propose to extend this concept to include metabolite assemblies as possible seeds that may be
ed upstream to protein aggregation and may facilitate this process."
More importantly, it (metabolite accumulation leading to amyloid formation) may be true for
matic metabolites, such as Trp, Phe and Tyr etc. and I appreciate the mentioning of these
umulation by the authors. The focus on aromatic metabolites, particularly those that have been
wn to form amyloid like structures, experimentally, should be discussed only. The authors should
mention that the aggregation of all these aromatic metabolites is not possible only in physiological
ditions, rather most metabolite aggregation as I learnt from the published papers involve high
centration and conditions of elevated temperature that too in some cases the aggregates are formed
eating and slow cooling of the metabolite samples (Reference 12). It is very important to mention
ut these non-physiological aggregation conditions for some metabolites in this review. Otherwise
ads as every metabolite forms amyloid aggregates under physiological conditions.
ponse: We appreciate the point raised by the reviewer. However, there are few evidence for
cture formation of non-aromatic metabolites. One example of non-aromatic accumulation of
mical in brain of AD is chitin-like structures composed of insoluble N-acetyl-glucosamine
mblies in amyloid plaques which are co-localized with beta-amyloid (Castellani, R. J., et
eurotoxicity, 2007. Sotgiu, S., et al. Journal of Neuroimmunology, 2008). Another example is the
toxic assemblies of cysteine (reference 12) and structure formation of glycine (reference 16).
arding the conditions for metabolites structure formation, described in our study (reference 12) the
ing process is used only to reach a monomeric state of the materials in PBS, prior to assembly.
re are other ways to reach monomeric state, such as dissolving the metabolites in different solvents,
er than PBS which was used in our study. This is mentioned in Shaham-Niv et al. (reference 12-
Adv. 2015) and is not in the scope of our hypothesis paper.
uthors must take into consideration that cell compartment is a very complex system with the
ous biomolecules in the same environment, maintaining a homeostasis among metabolite levels. It
ifficult to propose that accumulated metabolites will only form amyloids which can cross-seed
eins. What about arginine? Arginine is known to strongly protect amyloid aggregation of proteins.
d evidences both in vivo and in vitro studies are essential to the proposed the hypothesis,
icularly on common amyloid cross seeding, that the authors are claiming in the review. One more
ortant aspect the authors must discuss is the amyloid cross seeding among proteins as shown
ntly (The Journal of Biochemistry 2016 vol 160, pp325, Biochemistry 2014). So my point is not all
metabolite accumulation will lead to amyloid aggregation. It may vary from metabolite to
abolite. Some accumulation may be protective. Each metabolite is linked to many important
hemical reactions in the cellular events. Hence increase in the concentration of the metabolite
affect the equilibrium of the vital biochemical reactions that may affect the cell normalcy, leading
everities. Hence accumulation, or rise in the concentration of any metabolite itself can be lethal
without forming amyloid aggregates
ponse: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We agree that cell compartment is a very
plex system and that accumulation, or rise in the concentration of any metabolite itself can be
al (as described in references 12, 13), this does not contradict our hypothesis. As discussed before,
did not mention that all metabolites may form assemblies or that highly soluble charged amino
, such as arginine, where electrostatic repulsion does not allow assembly, aggregates. We
gested specific candidates, based on published studies, to be further tested for structure formation
possible cross-seeding of related proteins. We are aware that it could be proved wrong for some
abolites and proteins. We discussed above amyloid cross-seeding among proteins and added the
essary correction in the text and the suggested references.
53 aggregation has been reported and authors try to propose that this event is due to the amyloid
s-seeding without any direct or indirect research reports on this. The accumulation of the
abolites in cancer cells, as authors describe, does not make sense to this reviewer when they
elated it to amyloid cross-seeding.

hypothesize that excess QA accumulation may lead to metabolite amyloid-like fibrils formation,
ch cannot be degraded by QPRTase. The putative QA fibrils co-localize with aggregated
ogenous proteins such as tau, and may serve as a seed to increase further aggregation of
regation-prone proteins (Figure 2)……
way, the authors are proposing common amyloid cross-seeding behind this (above statement).
the question is do we know whether QA can form amyloid structures under physiological
centration and buffer conditions. As of now, we do not know. Secondly, assuming that QA forms
loids, Is cross-seeding specific to p53. If we believe the experimental evidences of cross-seeding
shown in ref 24) Phe-amyloid’s cross-seeding ability is not protein specific. Hence, the QA
umulation in the cytosol may possibly be capable of cross-seeding unrelated proteins, not only the
. So, unless one proves that QA can aggregate and QA aggregates can specifically drive
regation of p53, the proposed statement in the manuscript can mislead the readers. Further, the
cept amyloid-cross seeding for p53 aggregation is not clear as well. If the metabolite aggregates
forms toxic amyloids in tumorigenic cells, would not it trigger apoptotic death in cells due to the
e reasons that the author are describing (ref no 12), two critical consequences: i.,e., the loss of
ein function and toxic gain of functions. By the same logic it may help in the killing of cancerous
s, not converting them into tumerogenic cells. Hence the amyloid aggregation of aromatic
abolites must be discussed and at the same time the accumulation of other metabolites and their
tified functions can be discussed. However the manuscript must not generalize the accumulation
etabolites would lead to amyloid fibrils as a universal event.
ponse: We thank the reviewer for this comment. First, in relation to p53, and oncometabolites, we
not mention that the accumulation of metabolites occur in the cancer cells. As discussed above and
d on studies suggested that oncometabolites promote malignancy upon accumulation and alter the
vity of proteins (references 40-42), we suggested p53 and VHL as an example for tumor suppressor
ein, which their function may be altered by oncometabolites. This alteration, as well as metabolite
mulation not necessarily occur in tumorigenic cells.
ond, we never mentioned (in page 8, line175) that QA seeds P53 aggregation. We suggested the
ible cross-seeding of neurodegeneration related proteins by QA. To make this clear we revised the
accordingly (page 8; line 175): "The putative QA fibrils co-localize with aggregated endogenous
eins, and may serve as a seed to increase further aggregation of pathological, aggregation-prone
eins, such as tau, Aß and a-synuclein (Figure 2)."
experimental basis for our hypothesis regarding QA was extensively detailed in the manuscript.
inally, the concept of the cross seeding is very new and must be carefully discussed with limitations
ording to available research reports such as the case of PKU. Accumulation of metabolites in
ases is also very informative and must be discussed as such, without unnecessarily linking to
loid cross-seeding. Information regarding what types of metabolites accumulate in which types
ases is very helpful. At the same time, linking amyloid formation of such metabolites to the disease
hanism is misleading, without direct or indirect experimental evidences. The authors must discuss
ut amyloid formation of the metabolites if it has been reported so. The concept of cross-seeding is
only restricted to metabolite-amyloids. As we have seen in recent reports that amyloid of one type
rotein can cross-seed other proteins. There are reports that inclusions can also trap proteins with
nsically disordered stretches in their structures. So, it is possible that protein amyloids can trap
abolites into aggregated structures. In such case it would lower certain metabolite concentration.
ld not that affect the normal physiology?
ponse: We thank the reviewer for the comments. All of these points were discussed and countered
ve. We believe that the revised manuscript, based on the reviewer comments is significantly
roved.

authors address an important aspect associated with biochemical pathways that has been so far
ifically overlooked. The maintenance of metabolic homeostasis is an important part of cellular
siology. However, how this is maintained in health and disease is not very well explored and
ussed in the literature. A very interesting concept presented in this review is the seeding of
abolites into ordered amyloid like assemblies. Since growing literature has pointed towards the
egulation of metabolism in both neurodegeneration and cancer, and associated scattered
emiological inferences, this review will prove to be a significant consolidation of how metabolite
mblies can affect and seed proteins into amyloid like assemblies, thus triggering disease. It is
gested that metabolite accumulation and molecular self assembly could be early events in the
ade leading to neurodegeneration. It indeed provides a new paradigm for further experimental
ies, and will provide an alternative outlook to the underlying cause of disease.
paper is well written, and I am impressed by the associations that have been clarified regarding
abolic disorders, neurodegeneration and cancer. I strongly recommend this paper for publication

thank the reviewer for the constructive evaluation of our study. We appreciate the time and effort
sted by the reviewer and the excellent comments. We are grateful for the suggestions made by the
ewer, which inspired us to revise the paper. The text clarifications made in the manuscript
roved it significantly.
ine 54: Interference in a given metabolic process can lead to deficiencies or accumulation of
abolites (the authors have made this claim; is there any literature supporting this; could you briefly
ain in the text what could be the sources of this interference?)
ponse: We thank the reviewer this important comment. A specific example for this claim (is
ented in the next paragraph, for PKU. However in order to make this statement more clear we
sed the text and mention figure 1 that describes a metabolic pathway and the possible interferences,
ing to metabolite accumulation. We revised the text accordingly (page 3; line 53): "Interference in
ven metabolic process can lead to deficiencies or accumulation of metabolites (Figure 1)."
ine 58 and 59: maybe a good idea to mention primary metabolites, especially so since you have
mentioned secondary metabolites.

Would it be relevant to comment on the physiological concentrations of metabolites (where
lable). These concentrations have been mentioned in the text for metabolic disorders. However,
e are not mentioned for all the metabolites implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer. Perhaps,
could insert in the table an extra column of normal concentrations vs. abnormal concentrations

amine is mentioned in the text, but not in the table. Any specific reasons for the same?
ponse: We thank the reviewer for this sharp observation and useful comment. We added dopamine

centrations to the table but unfortunately, in most cases the concentrations in the relevant organ

necessarily informative and we prefer not to add such data that might be misleading.
