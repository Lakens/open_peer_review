This is a fairly straight forward research. Although the idea is not completely novel, the testing is
exhaustive and robust. The methodology, for the most part, is clear. The flow and organization of
the manuscript are acceptable, albeit it needs to be streamlined. Also, authors could improve the
phenotypic impact part of the research by quantifying the mating behavior with statistical power
to go with the existing schematic drawings (Figure 10) and the acoustic/auditory profiles (Figure
11). Finally, this manuscript will benefit from more thorough English editing. The detailed
comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript are provided in the attached PDF.

Zhang and coworkers identified several genes encoding histone deacetylase in Nilaparvata
lugens. They study the function of NlHDAC1, NlHDAC3, and NlHDAC4, which are involved in
female fertility. They show that NlHDAC1 is likely the main histone deacetylase in ovaries. They
demostrate the function of NlHDAC1 using a varity of approcaches, from RNA-seq analysis to
behavioral studies. Their investigation has been thoroughly performed and describe in detail the
different phenotypes of NlHDAC1. It is an excellent manuscript exhaustively covering a
phenotype with potential for pest control.
The only criticisms I would raise is that the results show the effect of a pleiotropic gene, as
expected by an overall regulator of chromatin function. Therefore, it is difficult to claim that a
particular pathway is affected when the RNAseq experiments shows an effect in thousand of
genes. I would suggest the authors to consider this point in the discussion, rather than listing all
pathways possibly involved.

Dear Dr Xu
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0158 entitled "The histone
deacetylase NlHDAC1 regulates both female and male fertility in the brown planthopper,
Nilaparvata lugens" has been accepted by the Editor for publication in Open Biology. The
reviewer(s) have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor revisions to your
manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments and revise your
manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
4
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee(s).
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.
Data accessibility section
To ensure archived data are available to readers, authors should include a ‘data accessibility’
section immediately after the acknowledgements section. This should list the database and
accession number for all data from the article that has been made publicly available, for instance:
• DNA sequences: Genbank accessions F234391-F234402
• Phylogenetic data: TreeBASE accession number S9123
• Final DNA sequence assembly uploaded as online supplemental material
• Climate data and MaxEnt input files: Dryad doi:10.5521/dryad.12311

Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Sincerely,

manuscript are provided in the attached PDF.
Response to Referee 1:
1. We quantified the courtship duration and copulation duration,
which were shown in lines 415-418 and Figure S6, in the revised
manuscript.
2. We did English editing as Referee 1 requested:
2.1. In the “Abstract”, we revised the words as the referee
suggested.
2.2. Lines 71-72, the sentence of “…hundreds of studies on
HDAC1 function in cancer were reported…” was revised to be
“…hundreds of studies on the growth-promoting activity of
HDAC1 in human cancer were reported…”.
2.3. Sentence in lines 82-84 have revised to be “Interestingly, a new
biological function was assigned to Rpd3, which showed that
wild type flies subjected to a seven hour training session
formed a robust long-term courtship memory, but this
phenotype was completed abolished in the Rpd3 mutant [28].”,
which are in lines 82-85 in the revised manuscript.
2.4. We revised the last paragraph of the introduction as the
referee’s suggestion, which corresponds to lines 103-113 in the
revised manuscript.
2.5. We added headings and subheadings in the “Material and
methods” as the referee suggested. However, we are not sure if
this fits the journal’s format.
2.6. We added headings and subheadings in the “results” part.
2.7. We added headings and subheadings in the “Discussion” part.
2.8. In the conclusion part, the referee suggested to add a schematic
drawing to summarize the existing and the novel hypothesis
examined in this study. We worry about a schematic drawing
might make redundant since the outlined conclusion is easy
enough to follow.

Response to Referee 2:
We agree with Referee 2 that HDACs serve as overall regulators of
chromatin modification, thus producing pleiotropic effects. We have
presented this point in the discussion part of the revised manuscript
(lines 513-515).
