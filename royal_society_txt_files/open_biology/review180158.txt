This is a fairly straight forward research. Although the idea is not completely novel, the testing is
exhaustive and robust. The methodology, for the most part, is clear. The flow and organization of
the manuscript are acceptable, albeit it needs to be streamlined. Also, authors could improve the
phenotypic impact part of the research by quantifying the mating behavior with statistical power
to go with the existing schematic drawings (Figure 10) and the acoustic/auditory profiles (Figure
11). Finally, this manuscript will benefit from more thorough English editing. The detailed
comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript are provided in the attached PDF.

Zhang and coworkers identified several genes encoding histone deacetylase in Nilaparvata
lugens. They study the function of NlHDAC1, NlHDAC3, and NlHDAC4, which are involved in
female fertility. They show that NlHDAC1 is likely the main histone deacetylase in ovaries. They
demostrate the function of NlHDAC1 using a varity of approcaches, from RNA-seq analysis to
behavioral studies. Their investigation has been thoroughly performed and describe in detail the
different phenotypes of NlHDAC1. It is an excellent manuscript exhaustively covering a
phenotype with potential for pest control.
The only criticisms I would raise is that the results show the effect of a pleiotropic gene, as
expected by an overall regulator of chromatin function. Therefore, it is difficult to claim that a
particular pathway is affected when the RNAseq experiments shows an effect in thousand of
genes. I would suggest the authors to consider this point in the discussion, rather than listing all
pathways possibly involved.

Appendix A
Thanks for the referees’ helpful comments. We now respond to the
referees’ comments point to point as follows:
Referee: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a fairly straight forward research. Although the idea is not
completely novel, the testing is exhaustive and robust. The
methodology, for the most part, is clear. The flow and
organization of the manuscript are acceptable, albeit it needs to
be streamlined. Also, authors could improve the phenotypic
impact part of the research by quantifying the mating behavior
with statistical power to go with the existing schematic drawings
(Figure 10) and the acoustic/auditory profiles (Figure 11). Finally,
this manuscript will benefit from more thorough English editing.
The detailed comments and suggestions to improve the
manuscript are provided in the attached PDF.
Response to Referee 1:
1. We quantified the courtship duration and copulation duration,
which were shown in lines 415-418 and Figure S6, in the revised
manuscript.
2. We did English editing as Referee 1 requested:
2.1. In the “Abstract”, we revised the words as the referee
suggested.
2.2. Lines 71-72, the sentence of “…hundreds of studies on
HDAC1 function in cancer were reported…” was revised to be
“…hundreds of studies on the growth-promoting activity of
HDAC1 in human cancer were reported…”.
2.3. Sentence in lines 82-84 have revised to be “Interestingly, a new
biological function was assigned to Rpd3, which showed that
wild type flies subjected to a seven hour training session
formed a robust long-term courtship memory, but this
phenotype was completed abolished in the Rpd3 mutant [28].”,
which are in lines 82-85 in the revised manuscript.
2.4. We revised the last paragraph of the introduction as the
referee’s suggestion, which corresponds to lines 103-113 in the
revised manuscript.
2.5. We added headings and subheadings in the “Material and
methods” as the referee suggested. However, we are not sure if
this fits the journal’s format.
2.6. We added headings and subheadings in the “results” part.
2.7. We added headings and subheadings in the “Discussion” part.
2.8. In the conclusion part, the referee suggested to add a schematic
drawing to summarize the existing and the novel hypothesis
examined in this study. We worry about a schematic drawing
might make redundant since the outlined conclusion is easy
enough to follow.

Response to Referee 2:
We agree with Referee 2 that HDACs serve as overall regulators of
chromatin modification, thus producing pleiotropic effects. We have
presented this point in the discussion part of the revised manuscript
(lines 513-515).
