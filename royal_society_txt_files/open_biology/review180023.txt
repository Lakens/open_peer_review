The review article by Jung et al discusses three examples of transmembrane signaling systems in
bacteria that have been extensively studied by the authors. It explicitly points out some of the
biological complexities that can overlay basic signaling circuits. The article concludes with
discussion of chimeric sensors, their internal signaling elements (HAMP and S-helix), and several
biological readouts for sensor signal detection.
This article provides a nice overview (for molecular microbiologists) of the regulatory systems
most familiar to the authors and provides an extensive bibliography for accessing the primary
literature. However, I'm less convinced that the article in its present form will have a broad
appeal to general readers. It provides four figures that are much less sophisticated than the
accompanying text passages. I would encourage the authors to adjust their text to better match
the level of detail in their figures. For example, lines 115-140 present details about particular
residues in CadC, subdomains, protein secondary structures, dimers, a transmembrane helix, and
a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. Do general readers need to know these details
to appreciate the signaling logic of the CadC circuitry? If so, then the accompanying figure
should explicitly provide that level of graphic detail. If not, then I'd recommend streamlining the
more detailed molecular information, which seems extraneous to the central theme of the review.
I also had difficulty envisioning the kinds of applications that would benefit from "engineering
bacterial transmembrane signaling systems". Lines 41-44 and 78-87 mention several general areas
(e.g., diagnostic agents), but I would have liked at the outset a more specific application example
as a vehicle for discussing in general terms some of the engineering challenges later touched on
throughout the article.

The ms. of Jung et al. is an good general review of bacterial transmembrane signalling systems,
with some additional information regarding the engineering of such systems for
biosensor/diagnostic applications. In general the text is well written and the figures are simple
and clear. In my opinion, it is an interesting review for many readers and deserves publication,
only minor changes are suggested:
1. The title is misleading since most of the focus is made on the natural transmembrane signalling
system rather than on their engineering. Thus, I suggest the following title: "Bacterial
transmembrane signalling systems and their engineering for biosensing".
2. The text of section 4 "Rewiring receptors and signalling outputs" focus on engineering and will
benefit from having two Figures, one showing the engineering of chemoreceptors to control
motility and another one showing the engineering of TCS to control gene reporters.
3. Page 10, line 450: Reference 136 is only cited but not explained. Please, explain in more detail
how RGB colour vision is engineered in E. coli.
4. An important missing point of the review it is also that authors do not explain nor cite the
recent engineering of CadC by the group of Jerome Bonnet for its use in the detection of a small
metabolite (caffeine) when fused to a VHH (Chang et al. 2017). This is surprising, since the
authors describes CadC one-component system amply in the first section of the paper and it is
logic to describe the engineering of CadC.

>We thank the reviewer for this kind advice. Following the suggestion, we simplified the section about
CadC, but kept some level of detail where we think it is important to the reader. Therefore, we revised
Figure 2.
I also had difficulty envisioning the kinds of applications that would benefit from "engineering bacterial
transmembrane signalling systems". Lines 41-44 and 78-87 mention several general areas (e.g.,
diagnostic agents), but I would have liked at the outset a more specific application example as a vehicle
for discussing in general terms some of the engineering challenges later touched on throughout the
article.
>According to the Reviewer’s helpful suggestion, we rewrote the corresponding paragraphs and added
several examples illustrating future application:
LUDWIG-MAXIMILIANS-UNIVERSITÄT MÜNCHEN SEITE 2 VON 4
“Based on these natural properties bacteria can be (re-)programed to function as biosensors with
various applications. Bacterial derived biosensors could be used to monitor the concentration of toxins
or certain process parameters or products and by-products during the production and storage of foods
(see Reviews (1, 2)). Bacterial biosensors have the potential to revolutionize diagnostics and
therapeutics, a promising field in Synthetic Biology. Engineered bacteria have already been used to
detect and combat a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. These biosensors not only identify the
causative agent of pneumonia, but they produce a toxin to kill P. aeruginosa after exposure to the
pathogen (3). In the future, bacteria might not only produce drugs, hormones or tumour-killing agents
(4), but would also be equipped with sensory systems, so that they move themselves directly to the
target site in the body. Bacterial biosensors are self-replicating and less costly devices. They are small
and portable, so that they can be used in regions of the world, which are far away from modern analytical
laboratories.
Despite the promising applications of bacterial biosensors, there are still several limitations. For
example, most organic compounds cannot cross the cytoplasmic membrane and therefore biosensors
need specific transmembrane signalling systems. Still the number of thoroughly characterized receptors
able to detect external stimuli and transduce the information into a cellular signal is limited. Furthermore,
in many bacteria the stimulus-response is not linear, and the degree of output varies from cell to cell
within a population. Last but not least, the output needs to be rewired to an easy detectable readout.”

LUDWIG-MAXIMILIANS-UNIVERSITÄT MÜNCHEN SEITE 3 VON 4
Figure 5: Principles to rewire transmembrane signalling systems. Membrane-integrated methyl-
accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs, left part) are generally composed of two modules: an input
domain in the periplasm (PP) and in the cytoplasmic membrane (CM), which is responsible for ligand
binding and signal transduction, and an output domain in the cytoplasm (CP), which induces a cellular
response. Both domains are connected by a linker domain. Whereas input domains are highly diverse,
variation in the output domains is rather limited. There are three common schemes for an output:
nucleotide cyclase activity (NTP= nucleotide triphosphate <U+F0E0> cNMP= cyclic nucleotide monophosphate)
(outermost left); alterations of the direction of the flagellar motor (CCW = counter clockwise, CW =
clockwise rotation) including the formation of a ternary complex between MCPs/CheW(W)/CheA(A) and
(de-)phosphorylation of CheY(Y) (innermost left), and transcriptional regulation (right). Sensor kinases
perceive a stimulus and transduce the signal via phosphorylation to a response regulator that acts as
transcription factor for natural or reporter genes. The modular design of transmembrane signalling
systems allows the generation of chimeric receptors in which either the input, the linker or the output
domain are replaced (domain colour switch). Sensor kinases can be rewired by amino acid replacement
(blue/green stripes) to allow activation of a non-cognate response regulator.
3. Page 10, line 450: Reference 136 is only cited but not explained. Please, explain in more detail how
RGB colour vision is engineered in E. coli.
>As recommended the paragraph in the manuscript was extended:
“By combining several of the principles outlined above, a recent study reported the engineering of RGB
colour vision into E. coli (135). The RGB program consists of four subsystems. The first is an array of
light sensors, which respond to different wavelengths. Specifically, red and green light sensing is based
on phytochromes with phycocyanobilin chromophores, whereas the blue light sensor contains a flavin
mononucleotide. The second subsystem – the ‘circuit’ – processes the signals to integrate them or
execute a dynamic response. Third, the so-called ‘resource allocator’ acts as a connector between the
circuit output and the ‘actuators’, the fourth subsystem. The spectral response of the engineered RGB
system was measured by using fluorescent reporters or enzymes that generate coloured pigments.
Fernandez-Rodriguez et al. (135) were able to produce ‘colour photographs’ of grown bacteria on
plates. This is a perfect example of the potential of rewired prokaryotic signalling cascades for Synthetic
Biology.”
4. An important missing point of the review it is also that authors do not explain nor cite the recent
engineering of CadC by the group of Jerome Bonnet for its use in the detection of a small metabolite
(caffeine) when fused to a VHH (Chang et al. 2017). This is surprising, since the authors describes
CadC one-component system amply in the first section of the paper and it is logic to describe the
engineering of CadC.
>Thank you very much for bringing this important paper to our attention. We included a new paragraph
in the revised version of the manuscript:
“Along the same line, the above described one-component-system CadC was used to generate a
functional hybrid responding to caffeine as external stimulus (14). CadC activation requires dimerization
via its periplasmic pH sensing domain (32, 34, 36). Accordingly, a protein variant lacking this input
domain can no longer induce cadBA transcription. By fusing the CadC DNA-binding domain to a single-
domain camelid antibody VHH (109), Chang et al. achieved ligand-induced dimerization and could in
turn activate the PcadBA promoter (14). This exemplifies how modular receptor design based on split-
DNA-binding domains combined with the versatility of antibody-based ligand detection can greatly
expand the sensory repertoire in bacteria.”
