Review of Amon et al. for Open Biology
The manuscript describes a gene cluster for the degradation of nicotinic acid in Aspergillus
nidulans based on coordinated expression under inducing and repressing conditions and
regulator mutant constructs. Phylogenetic analysis is used to infer the convergent origin of
nicotinate hydroxylase via duplication of xanthine dehydrogenase in both bacteria and fungi. I
found the manuscript extensively detailed and well suited to arguing both of the main
conclusions. Degradative/assimilative gene clusters are rather neglected in fungi compared to
biosynthetic clusters, but are clearly very important for fungal lifestyles. The majority of the
suggestions I have are for English usage, but I also have some additional questions.
The manuscript is rather long due to extensive details being explained, for instance related to
conservation of amino acid residues. Figure legends are also quite long.
There is also a lot of reliance on “unpublished data” from another manuscript, which would
preferably be minimized.
The cluster is not conserved with regards to the presence of the focal enzyme, nicotinate
hydroxylase. The first 4 genes are the most highly conserved in presence and order. There is no
model presented for the path these enzymes (and 2 transporters) encode. What would they be
doing outside the nicotinate degradation context? Presumably the transporters are involved in
compartmentalization, and hxnR has been shown to regulate the pathway, but what does the
dioxygenase do?
In the absence of nicotinate hydroxylase, is the ancestral paralog expected to be promiscuous for
xanthine and nicotinate degradation?
Is there evidence additional nicotinate metabolism genes were re-acquired by Penicillium species
via HGT?
Would like to see conventional support values on ML phylogeny (ML bootstraps)
Please be sure to check on the availability of all JGI genomes used.
Convergence has been argued in the duplication resulting in nicotinate hydroxylase. But are the
bacterial and fungal clusters also convergent? How do the characterized bacterial pathways
proceed? Does it also involve a dioxygenase and oxidoreductase?
What is a “duplicated allele”? Is it a paralog?

The paper by Amon et al. reports on the identification and characterization of the first eukaryotic
nicotinate hydroxylase gene, which maps to a new nicotinate inducible gene cluster. The work is
well conceived and presented. I do not have any major criticism and I think that the manuscript
should be accepted for publication after minor editing of the english language.

Board Member's Comments to Author:
The authors' responses seem reasonable to me. They have made the minor changes except where
they point out that the information requested was already provided. The two larger issues are
that the manuscript is long and detailed, and there are several references to unpublished data.
These issues are linked and probably inevitable. The authors are trying to publish a complex
story based on evidence accumulated over many years. This would make an impossibly massive
manuscript, so they have split it. This is half the story, and is substantial and coherent in itself,
but inevitably there are some links to the other half, and that is not yet published. In this
instance, the authors certainly cannot be accused of "salami slicing" into "minimal publishable
units" and I would not want them to make the paper even longer, so I think we just have to
accept the ragged edges. I wonder whether they would consider publishing the other half in
Open Biology as well.
I do not feel that the manuscript needs a lot more attention, but I can't help commenting on a
small grammatical issue. Both the reviewer and the authors seem to be confused about the two
different meanings of “which”, with and without a comma. In the revised manuscript, the
comma is usually correct, but in lines 51, 153, 179, 184, 191, 475, 1283, “which” should preferably
be replaced by “that” and should certainly not be preceded by a comma.

Dear Editor:
We are glad that our article is acceptable for publication in Open Biology, after minor revision. Please
ind attached, together with the corrected manuscript our comment to the suggestions of the
eferees.
Reply to Referee 1
The manuscript describes a gene cluster for the degradation of nicotinic acid in Aspergillus nidulans
based on coordinated expression under inducing and repressing conditions and regulator mutant
constructs. Phylogenetic analysis is used to infer the convergent origin of nicotinate hydroxylase via
duplication of xanthine dehydrogenase in both bacteria and fungi. I found the manuscript extensively
detailed and well suited to arguing both of the main conclusions. Degradative/assimilative gene
clusters are rather neglected in fungi compared to biosynthetic clusters, but are clearly very
mportant for fungal lifestyles. The majority of the suggestions I have are for English usage, but I also
have some additional questions.
The manuscript is rather long due to extensive details being explained, for instance related to
conservation of amino acid residues. Figure legends are also quite long.
We understand the referee's point, however as this metabolic pathway has not been described
before, and the differences between HxA and HxnS have not been addressed, it is difficult to cut the
manuscript further without losing fundamental data.
There is also a lot of reliance on “unpublished data” from another manuscript, which would
preferably be minimized.
Again, we see the point, however, there is not of "lots of unpublished data". There is reference to old
unpublished data, these have been eliminated, as Joan Kelly is a co-author of the manuscript and her
old genetic data can be mentioned here without any other comment. However, in a few occasions
we are obliged to mention the manuscript in preparation, as it is relevant to the data discussed.
The cluster is not conserved with regards to the presence of the focal enzyme, nicotinate
hydroxylase. The first 4 genes are the most highly conserved in presence and order.
The referee is correct. We think we have discussed this adequately in section 2.6. However we have
ntroduces a sentence dealing specifically with the loss of hxnS:
“The absence of hxnS may imply that in these species the cluster deals with the utilisation of
nicotinate derivatives (such as 6-OH nicotinic acid) rather than that of nicotinate per se. (lines 364-
366)”
There is no model presented for the path these enzymes (and 2 transporters) encode. What would
hey be doing outside the nicotinate degradation context? Presumably the transporters are involved
n compartmentalization, and hxnR has been shown to regulate the pathway, but what does the
dioxygenase do?
n the first version of the manuscript we included the deletion of all genes, the phenotypes of the
deletions and molecular modelling of HxnY and HxnT. This made for a very long and complicated
article. We decided thus to concentrate in this first article on the regulation of the pathway and the
HxnR and HxnS proteins. We have now included a sentence (lines 317-320) giving a hint of the
unction of hxnT, hxnY hxnP and hxnT, which will be detailed in second article describing the whole
pathway. We hope this is adequate. More details would imply even more reference to unpublished
data.
In the absence of nicotinate hydroxylase, is the ancestral paralog expected to be promiscuous for
xanthine and nicotinate degradation?
Probably not, the ancestral paralogue as it can be deduced from the sequence of the out groups was
a typical xanthine dehydrogenase. This in fact is discussed in lines 217-250 of results. We have
however added a sentence to clarify this point:
“The peptidic sequence of the outgroups strongly suggests that the basal enzyme was a typical
xanthine dehydrogenase. (lines 223 to 225)”
Is there evidence additional nicotinate metabolism genes were re-acquired by Penicillium species via
HGT?
The only gene for which there is evidence of horizontal transfer in the Penicillia is the hxnS gene,
probably from Hypocreales, as stated in both the text (lines 367 to 370) and in Supplementary
material.
Would like to see conventional support values on ML phylogeny (ML bootstraps)
There is no direct way to convert aLTRs to bootstraps values. This could be obtained only be re-
unning the phylogeny and then re-do the figures. We would be prepared to do that if a cogent
cientific reason is given for this. aLTRs values are deemed to be perfectly acceptable values of
confidence in Maximum Likelihood phylogenies (Anisimova and Gascuel, 2006, Syst Biol. 55(4):539-
52, Anismova et al. 2011, Syst. Biol. 60 (5) 685-99), we have used them in all our recent articles as
hey cut down considerably computing time (Karácsony et al. 2014, Mol Microbiol. 94(2):383-402.
doi: 10.1111/mmi.12772. ; Flipphi et al. 2017, Fungal Biol Biotechnol. 4:7. doi: 10.1186/s40694-017-
0037-y) and this was deemed acceptable by referees and editors.
Please be sure to check on the availability of all JGI genomes used.
All the used JGI sequences are available on MycoCosm. We have added details of permissions
elating to this in Materials and methods and acknowledgments. We have also modified figure 8 so
as to include only species where the sequences are fully and freely available.
Convergence has been argued in the duplication resulting in nicotinate hydroxylase. But are the
bacterial and fungal clusters also convergent?
ndeed they are! However this question will only be addressed when we analyse in detail the
pathway which will be the subject of our second publication.
How do the characterized bacterial pathways proceed? Does it also involve a dioxygenase and
oxidoreductase?
Yes, dioxygenases and oxidoreductases are involved in the hydroxylation of 6-hydroxynicotinate, 2,5-
dihydroxypyridine, 2,6-dihydroxinicotinate, 2,3,6-trihydroxypyridine.We have given exact references
as to this (for Pseudomonas see (Behrman & Stanier, 1957, Jimenez et al., 2008, Hughes, 1955); for
Bacillus see (Ensign & Rittenberg, 1964) or (Nagel and Andreesen 1990); for Eubacterium see (Harary,
1957, Alhapel et al., 2006)). However the bacterial and fungal enzymes are not orthologues. This
again, will be the subject of a further publication.
What is a “duplicated allele”? Is it a paralog?
Yes, it is a paralogue and it has been corrected in the text. (line 1221)
“Constitutive mutations within HxnR map in two discrete patches.” does not make sense to me in the
abstract.
Original sentence: Constitutive mutations within HxnR map in two discrete patches.
Corrected sentence: Within the hxnR gene, constitutive mutations map in two discrete regions. (lines
35-36)

ummarised below.
Corrected sentence: The results have only been published schematically [1-3, 20] and thus will be
ummarised below. (line 82)
Line 108 “evolutionary (relationships)”
Original sentence: We discuss the evolutionary relations between the structurally similar but
unctionally distinct HxA and HxnS paralogues, the domain structure of HxnR and the conservation of
he nicotinate gene cluster in the Aspergillaceae.
Corrected sentence: We discuss the evolutionary relationships between the structurally similar but
unctionally distinct HxA and HxnS paralogues, the domain structure of HxnR and the conservation of
he nicotinate gene cluster in the Aspergillaceae. (lines 107-109 in corrected text)
Line 218 “originated (from) hxnS”
Original sentence: A gene duplication of an ancestral hxA-like gene probably originated hxnS.
Corrected sentence: The hxnS gene probably resulted from duplication and divergence of an
ancestral hxA gene. (line 217)
Line 299 this last sentence would be better phrased as the # of total classes sequenced that have
both genes clustered.
Original sentence: These 85 species represent all classes of the Pezizomycotina subphylum with
genome sequenced species with the exception of the Orbiliomycetes and the Lecanoromycetes.
Corrected sentence: These 85 species include all classes of the Pezizomycotina subphylum with the
exception of the Orbiliomycetes and the Lecanoromycetes. (lines 301-303)
Line 320 “is the pattern of co-expression consistently distinct from adjacent genes?
Yes, this has been clearly stated in the text. (lines 311-313)
Line 331 “behaves qualitatively (the same) as the five”
Original sentence: The transcript of hxB, which had previously been found to be independently
egulated by HxnR and UaY (and thus independently induced by nicotinate and uric acid, behaves
qualitatively as the five structural genes in the cluster (figure 6B).

egulated by HxnR and UaY (and thus independently induced by nicotinate and uric acid) behaves
qualitatively likewise the five structural genes in the cluster (figure 6B). (lines 332-335)
Lines 505, 507 “led” not “lead”
Original sentence: While the selective pressures that lead to the conservation of clustering of genes
of a specific metabolic pathway have been the subject of animated discussion, ....
Corrected sentence: While the selective pressures that led to the conservation of clustering of genes

29 Abstract
30 Nicotinate degradation has hitherto been elucidated only in bacteria. In the ascomycete
31 Aspergillus nidulans, six loci, hxnS/AN9178 encoding the molybdenum cofactor-containing
32 nicotinate hydroxylase, AN11197 encoding a Cys2/His2 zinc finger regulator HxnR, together
33 with AN11196/hxnZ, AN11188/hxnY, AN11189/hxnP and AN9177/hxnT are clustered and
34 stringently co-induced by a nicotinate derivative and subject to nitrogen metabolite repression
35 mediated by the GATA factor AreA. These genes are strictly co-regulated by HxnR. Within
36 the hxnR gene, Cconstitutive mutations within HxnR map in two discrete patchesregions. A. Formatted: Font: Italic
37 nidulans is capable of utilising nicotinate and its oxidation products 6-hydroxynicotinic acid
38 and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine as sole nitrogen sources in an HxnR-dependent way. HxnS is
39 highly similar to HxA, the canonical xanthine dehydrogenase and has originated by gene
40 duplication, preceding the origin of the Pezizomycotina. This cluster is conserved with some
41 variations throughout the Aspergillaceae. Our results imply that a fungal pathway has arisen
42 independently from bacterial ones. Significantly, the neo-functionalisation of xanthine
43 dehydrogenase into nicotinate hydroxylase has occurred independently from analogous events
44 in bacteria. This work describes for the first time a gene cluster involved in nicotinate
45 catabolism in a eukaryote and has relevance for the formation and evolution of co-regulated
46 primary metabolic gene clusters and the microbial degradation of N-heterocyclic compounds.

49 1. Introduction
50
51 Filamentous ascomycetes comprise metabolically versatile saprophytes, which can utilise a
52 large variety of metabolites as nitrogen and/or carbon sources. The utilisation of nicotinic acid
53 has been studied in bacteria, but it has only been addressed in a eukaryotic microorganism by
54 our early work in Aspergillus nidulans. An enzyme of the xanthine dehydrogenase group [1-
55 3] is necessary for this process. Strains mutant in the cnx (cnxABC, cnxE, cnxF, cnxG and
56 cnxH) or hxB genes cannot utilise nicotinate. The cnx genes are required for the synthesis of
57 the molybdenum cofactor (MOCO) common to xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and nitrate
58 reductase [4, 5]. The HxB protein catalyses the sulphuration of the Mo(VI), essential for the
59 activity of the enzymes of the Xanthine dehydrogenase group [5, 6].
60 Two enzymes of the Xanthine dehydrogenase family have been described in Aspergillus
61 nidulans. Purine hydroxylase I (PHI, HxA encoded by the hxA gene) is a typical xanthine
62 dehydrogenase [7-9]. Purine hydroxylase II (PHII, HxnS see below) has unprecedented
63 substrate specificity. Hypoxanthine, but not xanthine, serves as a substrate of PHII. It accepts
64 nicotinate as a substrate and catalyses the first step of nicotinate catabolism [1, 7, 10]. Table 1
65 shows some kinetic parameters for PHI (HxA) and PHII (HxnS) summarised from the
66 relevant literature.
67
68 PHII is absent in mycelia grown on nitrogen sources generally considered non-repressive. It is
69 apparently induced by nicotinate but it is also present in nitrogen-starved mycelia [1]. The
70 physiological inducer is either 6-OH nicotinate and/or a metabolite further along the
71 nicotinate utilisation pathway [11]. The expression of PHII is not under the control of UaY,
72 the transcription factor specific for the expression of the genes in the purine utilisation
73 pathway including hxA [12-14].
5
74 Concentrations of nicotinate below those that can serve as sole nitrogen sources allow
75 hypoxanthine utilisation by hxA- strains [15, 16]. Nicotinate induces PHII, which catalyses the
76 hydroxylation of hypoxanthine to xanthine. Xanthine is further hydroxylated to uric acid by a
77 xanthine dioxygenase encoded by the xanA gene [17-19]. This is schematised in figure 1. The
78 induction pattern implies that PHII belongs physiologically to the nicotinate utilisation
79 pathway and not to the purine utilisation pathway.
80
81 In the 70s and 80s we attempted to characterise genetically the nicotinate utilisation pathway
82 in A. nidulans. The results have only been published schematically [1-3, 20] and thus will be
83 summarised below. We isolated mutants able to grow on hypoxanthine as nitrogen source, but
84 not on a medium that contains hypoxanthine, allopurinol and nicotinate (1mM), which at this
85 concentration, does not serve as a nitrogen source but fully induces PHII [1]. The wild type
86 grows on this medium, as PHII (resistant to allopurinol inhibition [1, 7]) hydroxylates
87 hypoxanthine to xanthine, which is further hydroxylated to uric acid by the XanA protein
88 (figure 1). Three groups of mutations, mapping in three different genes, were obtained. One
89 group, hxnS, results in inability to grow on the isolation medium and on nicotinic acid as sole
90 nitrogen source (10 mM) but maintains its ability to grow on 6-OH nicotinate. These
91 mutations define the structural gene for PHII. Non-leaky hxnS mutations resulted in loss of
92 PHII enzyme activity but were heterogeneous regarding PHII cross-reacting material (CRM)
93 [2, 20]. FuthermoreFurthermore, mutations in hxnR result also in complete inability to grow
94 on 6-OH nicotinate. hxnR mutants are non-inducible for PHII activity or CRM [20]. The hxnR
95 mutations are fully recessive and thus represent loss-of-function mutations. They define an
96 activating transcription factor, necessary for the expression of hxnS and at least one other
97 enzyme of the nicotinate utilisation pathway, involved in the downstream conversion of 6-OH
98 nicotinate. A number of mutants constitutive for PHII, were called aplAc [1]. These represent
6
99 regulatory gain-of-function mutations [1]. The aplA and hxnR mutations could represent two
100 tightly linked genes or a single gene where the relatively frequent constitutive mutations
101 define (a) negative-acting domain(s). The hxnS, hxnR and aplA mutations are tightly linked on
102 chromosome VI (<1 CM, for crosses involving several alleles of the three classes, J. M. Kelly
103 and C. Scazzocchio, unpublished results). One mutation isolated, described elsewhere, defines
104 the xanA gene [17, 18].
105
106 We report here that hxnS and hxnR are part of an extended gene cluster that includes four
107 additional co-regulated genes. The aplAc mutations map in specific domains of the hxnR gene
108 product. We discuss the evolutionary relationships between the structurally similar but
109 functionally distinct HxA and HxnS paralogues, the domain structure of HxnR and the
110 conservation of the nicotinate gene cluster in the Aspergillaceae.
111
112 2. Results
113
114 2.1. Identification and characterisation of the hxnS gene
115 We expected the hxnS gene to be a paralogue of hxA [7, 15]. In the A. nidulans genomic
116 sequences of the Cereon Aspergillus Sequencing Project (later incorporated into the
117 Aspergillus Genome Database – AspGD [21]), we found an incomplete homologue of hxA
118 [9]. We localised the sequence encoding this XDH paralogue to chromosome VI cosmid
119 W31:H08 (see Materials and Methods), in line with the mapping of hxnS. This cosmid
120 complements both the hxnS41 and the hxnR2 loss-of-function mutations. We sequenced the
121 region comprising the putative hxnS gene to reveal a protein with very high (51 %) identity to
122 PHI encoded by the hxA gene and identical with the protein specified by the AN9178 locus in
123 AspGD genome database (GenBank accession number KY962010). The cognate full-length
7
124 cDNA sequence was also obtained (GenBank accession number KX585438). The hxnS open
125 reading frame is interrupted by three introns in different positions to those extant in hxA
126 (figure 2). The hxnS gene encodes a protein of 1396 residues (HxA, 1363 residues). The
127 molecular masses are compatible with those experimentally determined for PHI and PHII
128 native dimers [7] and with the slower migration of HxnS seen in figure S1, in native
129 polyacrylamide gels. We deleted the putative hxnS gene (see Materials and Methods). The
130 deletion strain is able to grow on hypoxanthine, unable to utilise nicotinate as a nitrogen
131 source, unable to grow on media containing hypoxanthine (N-source), allopurinol (inhibitor of
132 PHI) and 100 µM nicotinate or 6-OH nicotinate (as inducer), which requires HxnS activity
133 (figure 3 and figure S1, the latter showing enzyme activities with both hypoxanthine and
134 nicotinic acid as substrates in native gels). hxnS<U+F044> strains are able to utilise 6-OH nicotinic
135 acid as a nitrogen source, albeit at a reduced level (figure 3, figure S1). The significance of
136 the latter is not clear as the cognate parent strain also utilises 6-OH nicotinate badly and an
137 hxB20 strain (see Introduction and the section: A tightly co-regulated gene cluster in Formatted: Font: Italic
138 chromosome VI for HxB function) does not seem to be impaired in its utilisation (figure 3).
139 Previously isolated hxnS mutations result in the same phenotype as hxnS<U+F044> on the N-source
140 hypoxanthine supplemented with allopurinol or on nicotinate. However, they do not show any
141 impairment in 6-OH nicotinate utilisation (figure S1). The three classical loss-of-function
142 mutations available were all isolated in an hxnRc7 background, which results in
143 overexpression of other genes under HxnR control (see below) encoding other proteins
144 putatively involved in 6-OH nicotinate utilisation (figure 6A and 6B). The hxnS35 and hxnS41
145 alleles are nonsense mutations (figure S1 shows the corresponding mutational changes), while
146 hxnS29 results in a Phe1213Ser change in a conserved region (figure 2). The hxnS35 and
147 hxnS41 mutations result in loss of PHII CRM, as assessed by immunoprecipitation, while
148 hxnS29, a leaky mutation on allopurinol supplemented hypoxanthine medium (see figure S1),
8
149 fully retains CRM [20]. The above constitutes formal evidence that the locus AN9178
150 specifies the hxnS gene. Strains carrying the hxnS29 mutation have a clear phenotype in vivo,
151 despite showing HxnS activity in vitro (figure S1). The Phe1213Ser mutation may affect the
152 stability rather than the activity of the enzyme. We have checked if 6-OH nicotinate (i.e., the
153 product of nicotinate hydroxylase activity) could also be a substrate for HxnS. A very faint
154 staining can be seen after 48 hours incubation, which is not stronger than the one obtained in
155 the absence of substrate, incubating the gel in the presence of the tetrazolium salt (not shown).
156
157 2.2. A comparison of HxnS (PHII) with HxA (PHI)
158 Figure 2 compares PHI (HxA) and PHII (HxnS) to the thoroughly chemically and structurally
159 characterised Bos taurus XDH enzyme [22, 23]. HxnS and HxA and their fungal orthologues
160 (see below) differ less from each other than other eukaryotic XDH paralogues, such as so-
161 called “aldehyde oxidases” from genuine XDHs. Eukaryotic "aldehyde oxidase", so
162 denominated for historical reasons, are enzymes very similar to XDH, but with different
163 substrate specificities [24, 25]. Features that differentiate HxnS from HxA and those that are
164 conserved in HxA and HxnS putative fungal orthologues are discussed below.
165 The residues involved in the two amino-terminal 2Fe/2S clusters, and the FAD- and NAD
166 binding residues identified in the crystal structure of the B. taurus enzyme, are strictly
167 conserved in HxA and HxnS (figure 2). HxnS comprises several insertions when compared to
168 HxA and other characterised XDHs (figure 2). The first insertion occurs between the second
169 and the third Cys residue of the second 2Fe/2S cluster. The sequence between the 2Fe/2S
170 cluster domain and the FAD/NAD binding domain is longer in HxnS. Within the FAD/NAD
171 domain, the residue corresponding to Phe417 of the B. taurus XDH is almost universally an
172 aromatic residue in XDHs (Tyr454 in HxA) but it is Ile (Ile478) in HxnS and always an
173 aliphatic hydrophobic residue in HxnS orthologues (figure 2). The carboxy-terminal
9
174 MOCO/substrate binding domain (starting from residue 590 in the B. taurus XDH) shows an
175 almost complete conservation of both the residues interacting with MOCO [26] and those
176 interacting with substrates, including most of the residues that line the substrate access
177 channel. His954 of the B. taurus enzyme, a residue not involved in the enzyme active site, is
178 conserved in HxA (His985) and in most of its orthologues. However, it is Pro (Pro1008) in
179 HxnS (figure 2) and in all its putative orthologues. This change does not affect the modelled
180 secondary structure (not shown, but see below). Other amino acid residues, which differ
181 systematically among HxA and HxnS orthologues (see section below) correspond to some of
182 the residues involved in MOCO binding, the Val1081 and Ser1082 of the B. taurus enzyme
183 are Ala1112 and Ser1113 in HxA but Ser1137 and Gly1138 in HxnS (figure 2). Conserved
184 residues include Arg880 of B. taurus XDH (Arg911 of HxA and Arg934 of HxnS), a residue,
185 which is never conserved in XDH-like aldehyde oxidases [9, 24, 25, 27]. Mutations affecting
186 this residue in hxA result in altered substrate specificity including a PHII-like resistance to
187 allopurinol inhibition and the inability to accept xanthine as a substrate [17, 27]. Glu803 of
188 the B. taurus enzyme is conserved in HxA (Glu833) and HxnS (Glu856). This key residue is
189 never conserved in XDH-like aldehyde oxidases [24]. Within the HxA MOCO/substrate
190 binding domain, several mutations result in either loss-of-function or altered substrate
191 specificity phenotypes [27]. All the corresponding residues involved are conserved in HxnS
192 (figure 2). The pair of aromatic amino acids, which sandwich the purine ring and orient the
193 substrate towards the MOCO are conserved (Phe914 and 1009 in the B. taurus enzyme, 954
194 and 1040 in HxA, 968 and 1064 in HxnS).
195 A striking exception to the sequence conservation is the insertion of an Ala (Ala1065 in
196 HxnS) between the almost universally conserved Phe1009 and Thr1010 (numeration as in the
197 B. taurus enzyme, Phe1040 and Thr1041 in HxA, Phe1064 and Thr1066 in HxnS; conserved
198 in all characterised XDHs but not in the eukaryotic XDH-like aldehyde oxidases [24], figure
10
199 2). The Phe/Thr pair is also conserved in bacterial XDHs (residues 459 and 460 in subunit B
200 of the Rhodobacter capsulatus XDH, [28]). An Ala insertion at this position is an almost
201 absolute feature of HxnS orthologues (FATAL in HxnS orthologues, FSTAL in Choiromyces
202 venosus putative HxnS, as compared with FTAL in all Pezizomycotina HxA orthologues).
203 Phe1013 is universally conserved in XDHs (Phe1044 in HxA), but it is a His (His1069) in
204 HxnS and its putative orthologues (figure 2). HxA and HxnS can be modelled to and
205 superimposed on the structure of the B. taurus XDH (figure S2). While modelling the active
206 site, no obvious differences can be seen in the orientation of the relevant active site residues
207 with the obvious exception of the orientation of Thr1066 of HxnS compared with Thr1041
208 (HxA) and Thr1010 (B. taurus XDH). This residue participates in the active site by
209 interacting with the carbonyl group of Phe1009 [29]. The hydroxyl group of Thr1010 is
210 involved in the binding of several inhibitors [29-31], but more importantly, either the N1 or
211 the N7 of hypoxanthine [32]. The corresponding Thr460 (within a FTLTH motif) of the B
212 subunit of the Rhodobacter capsulatus XDH has been shown to hydrogen bind the N7 of
213 hypoxanthine but the O6 of xanthine [30]. Further work should show whether the change of
214 orientation of the Thr residue is the key feature that allows to present the nicotinate molecule
215 to the MOCO centre.
216
217 2.3. Phylogeny of fungal Purine hydroxylases
218 The hxnS gene probably resulted from duplication and divergence of an ancestral hxA geneA Formatted: Font: Italic
Formatted: Font: Italic
219 gene duplication of an ancestral hxA-like gene probably originated hxnS [7]. We searched all
220 available fungal genomes for homologues of XDH (see figure S3, Table S1). Enzymes of this
221 group are absent from Rozella allomycis (Cryptomycota), the Microsporidia, the
222 Neocallimastigomycota, and the Mucoromycotina. Figure 4 and figure S3 show the
223 distribution of XDH-like enzymes among all fungal taxa. XDH-like enzymes are present in all
11
224 classes of the Pezizomycotina, basal species of the Taphrinomycotina and Saccharomycotina,
225 and some members of the Basidiomycota (see below). The peptidic sequence of the outgroups
226 strongly suggests that the basal enzyme was a typical xanthine dehydrogenase.
227 No hxnS-like gene is present outside the Pezizomycotina. Both hxA and hxnS orthologous
228 genes are present in the basal class Pezizomycetes while hxnS orthologues are absent from the
229 sequenced species of Orbiliomycetes and Lecanoromycetes. With the exceptions of
230 Oidiodendron maius and Rhytidhysteron rufulum (see legend to figure S3), all species of the
231 Pezizomycotina where a putative orthologue of HxnS is present, also carry an orthologue of
232 HxA. Loss of hxnS orthologues has occurred within the Eurotiomycetes: orthologues of HxA
233 are present in all species available, but the presence of HxnS is patchy, i.e., present in the
234 nidulantes group and the black Aspergilli, but not, for example, in A. flavus. With the
235 exception of Penicillium paxilli and Penicillium citrinum, which contain hxnS orthologues
236 (unlinked to hxnR, see below), the hxnS orthologues are missing from species of Penicillium.
237 Within the Sordariomycetes, a similar pattern of loss occurs, with hxnS orthologues present in
238 the Nectriaceae (order Hypocreales), but not in the Sordariales (such as Neurospora crassa,
239 Sordaria macrospora and Podospora anserina). The only PH-like enzyme present in
240 Oidiodendron maius (Leotiomycetes) could represent a second neo-functionalisation, in
241 which an enzyme phylogenetically related to HxnS would have re-acquired HxA substrate
242 specificity (see comments to figure S3). The phylogeny (figure 4 and figure S3) strongly
243 suggests a duplication of an HxA ancestral gene occurring at the root of the Dikarya. This
244 duplication would have been followed by either neo-functionalisation, leading to HxnS (in the
245 Pezizomycotina) or loss of one of the two ancestral paralogues with HxA function (elsewhere
246 in Dikarya). This discrepancy between the timing of duplication and neo-functionalisation
247 would account for the two separated clades of the XDHs of the Basidiomycota (one of them
248 clustering with HxnS orthologues), the divergence of Saitoella complicata and the Taphrina
12
249 spp. and the position of both the Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina as outgroups of
250 HxA orthologues rather than as an outgroup of all the Pezizomycotina PHs (see legend to
251 figure S3).
252 The hxnS orthologues, which have been included in figures 4 and S3, show a highly variable
253 exon/intron structure, as discussed in the Supplementary material (Comments on the exon-
254 intron structure of hxnS orthologues).The intron-exon structure of the hxnS orthologues that
255 have been included in figure 4 and figure S3, is highly variable. It is discussed in the legend to
256 figure S3.
257
258 2.4. Identification and characterisation of the hxnR/aplA gene
259 Closely linked to, but separated by locus AN9177 (to be called hxnT, see below), there is an
260 open reading frame of 2673 nt (interrupted by a single 75 nt intron) encoding a protein of 865
261 residues comprising two typical Cys2His2 Zn fingers near its amino terminus (AN11197). We
262 have re-sequenced this region (GenBank accession number KX669266). In the A. nidulans
263 open reading frame, there are two possible in-phase initiation codons separated by three
264 residues (MKAKM, figure S4). In other Aspergilli available in the databases, only the second
265 Met codon is present. As the first codon is within the transcribed sequences (RNA-seq data, J-
266 Browse module at http://www.aspgd.org/) we have assumed that this is the genuine start
267 codon in A. nidulans (in accordance with ref. [33]). Between residues 394 and 668, a PFAM
268 domain "Fungal transcription specific domain" PF04082 was detected (figure 5A). A nuclear
269 localisation signal from residue 77 to 87 (NLS, VLETRKRMRRA) downstream from the Zn
270 fingers is strongly predicted by cNLS mapper, while a nuclear export signal (NES, LDIDL) is
271 predicted for residues 285-289 by NetNES (figure 5A).
272
13
273 We deleted the whole AN11197 coding region. The resulting phenotype is identical to that
274 reported previously for hxnR loss-of-function mutations ([1, 3, 20], see figure 3, figure S1 and
275 transcriptional phenotypes in section: A tightly co-regulated gene cluster in chromosome VI):
276 inability to use nicotinate and 6-OH nicotinic acid as sole nitrogen sources, to which we can
277 add now the inability to use 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, an intermediate in the catabolism of
278 nicotinate in bacterial species [34, 35]. Figure 3 confirms that 2,5-dihydroxypyridine is an
279 inducing intermediate in A. nidulans as this metabolite allows strong growth on hypoxanthine
280 in the presence of allopurinol, which necessitates induction of hxnS.
281 Extant loss of function, as well as constitutive mutations (alpAc mutations see introduction)
282 map within the hxnR open reading frame (figure 5A). We have thus renamed the constitutive
283 regulatory mutations, hxnRc. We attempted to define the domain(s) comprising residues
284 mutable to constitutivity by selecting and sequencing additional hxnRc mutations (see
285 Material and Methods). All sequenced mutations are shown schematically in figure 5, while
286 the mutational changes are detailed in Table S2. As some mutational changes were detected
287 several times, in separate mutation runs, we have probably near-saturated the hxnR gene with
288 constitutive mutations.
289 We constructed a CONSURF profile of the HxnR protein, using putative orthologues from
290 123 species of the Pezizomycotina subphylum (figure S4, Table S3). All miss-sense
291 mutations, either constitutive or loss-of-function, map in highly conserved regions (figure 5).
292 Constitutive mutations map in two patches, one well-defined patch between residues 219 and
293 239, the other, a larger domain between residues 565 and 639. For a number of residues we
294 have obtained several different amino acid changes. Accessible aromatic residues at positions
295 226 and 228 and a basic residue at position 605 seem necessary for HxnR to be in its default,
296 inactive state, in the absence of its physiological inducer.
297
14
298 We detected putative HxnR orthologues only among the Pezizomycotina (Table S3). We
299 would expect a strong correlation between the presence of hxnR and hxnS orthologues. Out of
300 139 species of the Pezizomycotina screened, 40 have only hxnR and 14 only hxnS (Table S4).
301 Among the 85 species where both genes are extant, tight clustering is evident in most of them
302 (see below the section "Conservation of the hxn gene cluster in the Aspergillaceae"). The
303 absence of clustering is common among the Sordariomycetes, with the exception of the
304 Xylariales order where the clustering is maintained. These 85 species include all represent all
305 classes of the Pezizomycotina subphylum with genome-sequenced species with the exception
306 of the Orbiliomycetes and the Lecanoromycetes.
307
308 2.5. A tightly co-regulated gene cluster in chromosome VI
309 In A. nidulans, the hxnR and hxnS genes are within a cluster of co-regulated genes. This is
310 shown in figures 6 and 7. Six neighbouring genes, are inducible by nicotinate and 6-OH
311 nicotinate, are non-inducible in strains carrying either the hxnR2 or hxnR<U+2206> mutations and
312 show strong constitutive expression in the hxnRc7 background. The genes in the cluster are:
313 hxnS (AN9178), hxnT (AN9177), hxnR (AN11197) hxnP (AN11189), hxnY (AN11188) and
314 hxnZ (AN11196) (figure 6D). The flanking genes AN9179 (adjacent to hxnS) and AN9174
315 (adjacent to hxnZ and transcribed convergently), are not induced by nicotinate and they are
316 not affected by hxnR constitutive or loss-of-function mutations (not shown). The hxnP and
317 hxnZ genes encode transmembrane proteins of the Major Facilitator Superfamily
318 (PF07690.13). hxnT encodes a flavin oxidoreductase (Oxidored_FMN, PF00724), while hxnY
319 encodes a typical <U+F061>-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (PF14226.5 and PF03171.19). The
320 role of each genes in nicotinate utilisation and their phylogenetic relationships will be
321 discussed elsewhere, HxnP and hxnZ being involved in the uptake of nicotinate derived
322 metabolites and HxnT and HxnY in the further metabolism of 6-OH nicotinic acid (Bokor,
15
323 Flipphi, Ámon, Scazzocchio and Hamari, unpublished results). We can however state that for
324 each of these genes, the nearest homologue is a fungal- and not a bacterial gene (not shown).
325 hxnR is itself an inducible gene (figure 6A and B). There is a clearly detectable level of hxnR
326 transcript under non-induced conditions, at variance with the other genes of the cluster.
327 RNAseq data [21, 36], available in J.Browse (http://www.aspgd.org/), confirm the co-
328 regulation of the cluster, where all genes in this cluster are non-expressed in conditions of
329 nitrogen sufficiency and derepressed by nitrogen starvation. Under our experimental
330 conditions, with the exception of hxnR genes in the cluster are virtually non-expressed in
331 media that contain good nitrogen sources but are expressed under nitrogen-starved conditions
332 (figure 6C). All genes in the cluster are drastically repressed by ammonium (figure 6B, figure
333 7A). HxnR is necessary for expression under nitrogen starved conditions (figure 6C). The
334 strong constitutivity of hxnRc7 strains is clear in the presence of a non-repressive nitrogen
335 source (acetamide) or under conditions of nitrogen starvation. The transcript of hxB, which
336 had previously been found to be independently regulated by HxnR and UaY (and thus
337 independently induced by nicotinate and uric acid, [37]) behaves qualitatively likewise as the
338 five structural genes in the cluster (figure 6B).
339
340 The role of AreA, the GATA factor mediating nitrogen metabolite de-repression [38-40], is
341 shown for hxnS and hxnP in figure 7A. Transcription of both hxnS and hxnP is abolished in a
342 strain carrying a null areA mutation (areA600) under all conditions, including nitrogen
343 starvation. Surprisingly, the transcription of both hxnS and hxnP is diminished in a strain
344 carrying an xprD1 mutation (considered to be the most extremely de-repressed allele of areA,
345 ([41] and references there in); the allele is called xprD1 for historical reasons [38, 42]. In
346 contrast with the genes of the nitrate- and purine assimilation pathways [43-45], the
347 glutamate-aspartate transporter gene agtA [46] and also hxB [37], the hxnS and hxnP genes are
16
348 fully repressed by 10 mM ammonium in an xprD1 strain. A similar atypical effect has been
349 reported for the main urea transporter ureA gene [47].
350
351 A downstream metabolite of nicotinate is the physiological inducer of the HxnS protein [11].
352 Figure 7B shows this to be the case at the level of mRNA steady-state levels for both hxnS
353 and hxnP. In an hxB null mutant lacking HxnS activity, nicotinate does not behave as an
354 inducer but 6-OH nicotinate does. Thus the effector of HxnR is not nicotinate but 6-OH
355 nicotinate or a metabolite further downstream the nicotinate utilisation pathway. The in vivo
356 test shown in figure 3, where 2,5-dihydroxypyridine acts as inducer, suggests the latter to be
357 the case.
358
359 2.6. Conservation of the hxn gene cluster in the Aspergillaceae
360 The evolution of the whole nicotinate utilisation pathway in fungi will be dealt with in another
361 publication (Bokor, Flipphi, Ámon, Scazzocchio and Hamari, unpublished results), but we
362 discuss here the conservation of the hxn cluster in the Aspergillaceae family. Examples of the
363 organisation of the cluster are shown in figure 8. Episodes of gene gain and -loss are shown,
364 including the duplication of hxnY or hxnT as well as the loss of hxnT and hxnS. In A.
365 ochraceoroseus, only hxnS is present, a mirror image of the situation in A. flavus (and other
366 species in section Flavi) and P. digitatum (and all other Penicillium species but two), where
367 the genome includes all hxn genes with the exception of hxnS. The absence of hxnS may Formatted: Font: Italic
368 imply that in these species the cluster deals with the utilisation of nicotinate derivatives (such
369 as 6-OH nicotinic acid) rather than that of nicotinate per se. Formatted: Font: Italic
370 The situation in P. citrinum (and P. paxilli) implies a secondary reconstitution of the pathway
371 by horizontal transmission, as an unlinked orthologue of hxnS is present, seemingly re-
372 acquired from a member of the Hypocreales (order of Sordariomycetes, see phylogeny
17
373 section, figure S3). In A. niger, and related black Aspergilli albeit not in A. carbonarius or A.
374 aculeatus, a new, intron-less gene, encoding a putative nitroreductase is inserted in the cluster,
375 between hxnR and hxnT (see discussion).
376
377 3. Discussion
378
379 3.1. A nicotinate inducible eukaryotic cluster
380 With the exception of some of our own old work (see introduction) no genes or enzymes
381 involved in the degradation of nicotinate have been described in any eukaryote. Degradation
382 of nicotinic acid has been studied in plant cell cultures and tea plant material fed with
383 carboxyl-C14-nicotinic acid and C14-6-nicotinic acid, monitoring the formation of 14CO2 [48-
384 50]. No enzymes involved in these processes were identified and inspection of relevant
385 genomes only revealed one typical XDH. Thus, the A. nidulans HxnS is the hitherto only
386 eukaryotic nicotinate hydroxylase studied, and the hxn gene cluster we have identified is the
387 first co-regulated eukaryotic gene cluster involved in the utilisation of nicotinate ever
388 described.
389
390 3.2. The hxA/hxnS duplication compared to other eukaryotic MOCO-enzyme
391 duplications
392 Neo-functionalisation of enzymes of the XDH group arising from ascertained or presumed
393 gene duplications occur in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Fetzner and co-workers have
394 described the diversity of bacterial MOCO enzymes of the XDH group, even if the phylogeny
395 of these enzymes with different specificities remains unstudied [34, 51-54]. Duplication and
396 neo-functionalisation of genes encoding XDH-like enzymes are widespread in Metazoa,
397 studied mainly in insects and vertebrates. In Metazoa, a close linkage of the neo-
18
398 functionalised genes with strict conservation of intron/exon structure is the rule [24, 55-58].
399 The implication is that XDH gene duplication has occurred by different mechanisms in
400 metazoans and fungi. In metazoans, duplication seems to occur at the DNA level by unequal
401 cross-over. In the fungi, the striking amino acid sequence conservation among the HxA/HxnS
402 paralogues together with the variability of intron positions suggests that the duplication of an
403 HxA ancestral gene occurred via retroposition, followed by a re-intronisation either after or
404 concurrent with re-functionalisation of the duplicated gene. Not withstanding the mechanism
405 underlying this gene duplication, the hxA/hxnS duplication is quite ancient, occurring before
406 the divergence of the Taphrinomycotina from other Ascomycota, (>400 million years ago [59,
407 60]), which allows the possibility of intron loss and re-insertion. The variation of intron-exon
408 organisation in both the hxA and hxnS clades (not shown) is also consistent with this
409 possibility (figure 4 and figure S3, for the relevant positions in the phylogenetic tree).
410
411 3.3. Convergent evolution of bacterial and fungal nicotinate hydroxylases
412 MOCO enzymes able to catalyse the hydroxylation of nicotinate to 6-OH nicotinate have been
413 described in a variety of bacterial species [35, 61-63]. However, it can be excluded that the
414 HxnS proteins have originated by horizontal transmission from bacteria. In all eukaryotes
415 XDH-like enzymes are dimers of chains of approximately 1,500 amino acid residues
416 comprising three discrete domains (see figure 2). In bacteria, these domains are encoded by at
417 least two genes, one specifying a small subunit carrying the 2Fe/2S centres and the FAD
418 binding sequences and a large subunit carrying the MOCO and substrate binding centres.
419 These genes, included in an operon, reflect the amino- to carboxy-terminus order of the
420 domains in the eukaryotic XDH-like enzymes. A similar structure occurs in bacterial
421 nicotinate hydroxylases [35, 62], which makes improbable a direct bacterial origin of the
422 fungal nicotinate hydroxylases. Figure 4 and figure S3 show that HxnS orthologues have
19
423 originated by gene duplication within the fungal kingdom, possibly at the root of the Dikarya,
424 with a neo-functionalisation process occurring within the Pezizomycotina subphylum. BlastP
425 screening with the MOCO/substrate binding domains of both HxA and HxnS (figure 2)
426 against of all bacterial sequences available in the NCBI non-redundant protein (nr/nt)
427 database yielded homologues of the MOCO-binding subunits of putative bacterial XDHs, but
428 in no case (among the first 100 sequences) were MOCO subunits of known bacterial
429 nicotinate hydroxylases found (not shown). Thus, fungal nicotinate dehydrogenases show
430 more similarity to bacterial XDHs (and as a matter of course, to all genuine eukaryotic XDHs)
431 than to bacterial nicotinate dehydrogenases.
432
433 A comparison of the sequences of the MOCO and substrate binding subunits of bacteria
434 suggests that there are at least three classes of MOCO nicotinate hydroxylases, exemplified by
435 Pseudomonas putida, Eubacterium barkeri and Bacillus niacini, respectively [35, 61, 62]. We
436 have stated that the insertion of an Ala residue (HxnS Ala1065) between the conserved Phe
437 and Thr in the active site is a signature of fungal HxnS orthologues (see Sections 2 and 3 of
438 results). Genuine bacterial xanthine dehydrogenases also carry an FT motif in the cognate
439 place in the structure [28, 30], however, the divergence of bacterial nicotinate hydroxylases
440 from bacterial xanthine dehydrogenases is such that neither sequence alignments nor
441 structural modelling (not shown) gave a clear inkling of which modifications resulted in, or at
442 least correlate with the shift in substrate specificity. It seems that not only there has been
443 convergent evolution of fungal- and bacterial nicotinate hydroxylases, but that nicotinate
444 hydroxylases evolved several times independently within bacteria. A hint to the shift in
445 specificity towards hydroxylation of nicotinic acid is provided by the molecular structure of
446 the nicotinate hydroxylase of E. barkeri [63, 64]. In this enzyme, the substrate/MOCO
447 binding domain is split into two independent peptides (L and M). Strikingly, it carries a
20
448 selenium rather than a sulphur atom as the terminal ligand to the Mo(VI). Selenium also
449 occurs in the XDH of this organism [63, 64], which is consistent with an independent
450 evolution of the E. barkeri nicotinate hydroxylase from that of other bacterial enzymes of
451 similar specificity (see above). Most active site residues are conserved, with an interesting
452 exception. Tyr13 of subunit M (Tyr13M) is modelled to hydrogen-bind the heterocyclic N
453 atom of nicotinate by its hydroxyl group [63]. The corresponding residue in the B. taurus
454 xanthine dehydrogenase is Phe1005, which has not been proposed to interact with the
455 substrate [22, 23]. This Phe residue, four residues upstream of Phe1009 (of B. taurus) is
456 conserved in both HxA and HxnS (see figure 2) and indeed in all HxA and HxnS-like fungal
457 enzymes included in figure S3, with the exception of the putative xanthine dehydrogenase of
458 the four divergent Taphrina species, where it is substituted by a His. Tyr13M is not conserved
459 in several other characterised or putative nicotinic acid hydrolases such as those of P. putida
460 and its putative orthologues, where the corresponding residue is an Arg or a His. No sequence
461 similar to FTAL or FATAL is present in the enzyme of E. barkeri and its putative orthologues
462 (see figure S1 of [63]). It is tempting to speculate that the change in orientation of Thr1066 in
463 HxnS allows an interaction with nicotinate by its hydroxyl group similar to that seen for
464 modelled Tyr13M in E. barkeri. Biochemical evidence indicates that the carboxyl group of
465 nicotinate is essential for substrate binding of HxnS [65], the hydroxyl of Thr1006 could
466 potentially hydrogen-bind the carboxyl group of nicotinic acid. Differently from HxnS, the
467 enzyme of E. barkeri does not accept hypoxanthine as substrate [63]. It can be proposed that
468 the bacterial enzymes (at least the E. barkeri one) have fully evolved into dedicated nicotinate
469 hydroxylases, while the HxnS orthologues conserve properties of xanthine dehydrogenase.
470 The specific situation discussed for the homologue of O. maius, which can be proposed to
471 have reverted to a typical xanthine dehydrogenase activity from an HxnS-like enzyme (see
472 legend to figure S3) would be in line with this speculation.
21
473
474 3.4. An unusual specific transcription factor
475 Fungal transcription factors regulating specific metabolic primary or secondary pathways are
476 generally of the Zn2Cys6 (zinc cluster) class, while Cys2His2 (zinc finger) factors are
477 usually, with very few recorded possible exceptions [66, 67], broad domain regulators of
478 either metabolism and/or morphology. The closest characterised transcription factor, which
479 shares architecture and has sequence similarity with HxnR is Klf1p of Schizosaccharomyces
480 pombe. This factor is necessary for maintenance of long-term quiescence and its absence
481 results in abnormal cell morphology in the quiescent state [68]. The nearest homologue and
482 possible orthologue of Klf1p in A. nidulans is the protein of unknown function encoded by
483 AN6733. The latter is strictly conserved in a syntenic position in all Aspergilli included in the
484 AspGD database and putative orthologues are present in all sequenced members of the
485 Pezizomycotina (not shown). As hxnR is only present in the Pezizomycotina, it is tempting to
486 speculate that it originated from a duplication of the possibly essential ancestral orthologue of
487 AN6733, the duplicated gene being then recruited into the nicotinate utilisation pathway.
488
489 The apparent high frequency of constitutive, gain-of-function mutations, and their mapping
490 indicate that the HxnR protein is, in the absence of inducer, in a default state non-competent
491 to elicit transcription, and that the domains where constitutive mutations map are instrumental
492 in maintaining HxnR in this "closed", inactive state. The amino-terminal cluster of
493 constitutive mutations maps outside the PF04082 domain, in sequences that are conserved
494 only among HxnR orthologues. The carboxy-terminal mutantions map within the PF04082
495 domain conserved in Klf1, AN6733 and NCU05242 (the N. crassa orthologue of AN6733).
496 Note for example mutations affecting Lys603 in HxnR, a residue conserved in these four
497 proteins (figure 5, figure S4). The PF04082 domain of Gal4p (244-537) coincides with the
22
498 central regulatory domain of similarity proposed by Poch [69], see also Stone and Sadowski
499 [70]. The cognate domain of the A. nidulans NirA (pathway specific regulation of nitrate
500 assimilation) spans residues 230-487 [71]. Within this region map a cryo-sensitive, non-
501 inducible mutation (Arg347Ser) as well as its intragenic suppressors, some of which result in
502 constitutivity. This domain possibly interacts both with the NES and the C-terminal
503 transcription activation domain [71]. The evidence from different systems indicates that
504 PF04082 is an intramolecular interaction domain. Thus, the proposed neo-functionalisation of
505 HxnR would have involved the modification of the sequence between residues 208 and 239
506 (figure S4), as a module interacting with PF04082.
507
508 3.5. The evolution of clustering
509 Old genetic (J. M. Kelly and C. Scazzocchio, unpublished) and newly acquired data, which
510 will be reported elsewhere (Bokor, Flipphi, Ámon, Scazzocchio and Hamari, unpublished
511 data), established that not all the genes involved in nicotinate catabolism are within the hxnZ-
512 hxnS gene cluster. We have described the conservation of this cluster within the
513 Aspergillaceae. We discussed the origin of both hxnS and hxnR within the Pezizomycotina
514 subphylum. While the selective pressures that lead to the conservation of clustering of genes
515 of a specific metabolic pathway have been the subject of animated discussion [72-74], we
516 have no inkling of the recombination processes that lead to clustering of the hxn genes in the
517 first place. A model of recent local gene duplication can be excluded for the origin of all
518 genes in the cluster, each nearest paralogue in the same organism being in every case unlinked
519 and actually on a different chromosome (not shown). Within the Aspergillaceae, A. nidulans
520 represents the possible primeval situation, with a pattern of both loss and duplication for other
521 members of this family (figure 8). Recent duplication has occurred for some of the genes in
522 the cluster. In Monascus sp. (exemplified by M. purpureum ruber in figure 8) an unlinked
23
523 paralogue of hxnT is extant, showing 58 % amino acid identity with the copy within the
524 cluster and a strict conservation of intron positions. Duplicated paralogues of hxnY occur in
525 the flavii/nomius group and in species of the section Aspergillus. The fact that these
526 duplicated genes are unlinked to the cluster excludes a model of duplication by unequal cross-
527 over.
528 It is noteworthy that instances of duplications are coupled with instances of loss. Duplication
529 of hxnY in the section Aspergillus (exemplified by A. ruber, figure 8) is coupled with the loss
530 of hxnT, while that of hxnT in section Flavi (exemplified by A. flavus, figure 8) is coupled
531 with the loss of hxnS. This coupling may result from just one single recombination event.
532 Note that in M. purpureumruber, where there is no gene loss, duplication of hxnT coincides
533 with the separation of hxnS from the cluster. The duplication of hxnY, with conservation of
534 (some) intron positions seems to have occurred before the divergence of the flavi and the
535 fumigati group. Remarkably, only the duplicated hxnY paralogue is retained in A. fumigatus
536 and Neosartorya fischeri.
537 Horizontal transmission from pre-existent clusters has been established for both primary and
538 secondary metabolism pathways. It has been proposed that nitrate assimilation gene cluster of
539 fungi was horizontally transmitted from oomycetesA paradigmatic horizontal transmission in
540 primary metabolism is that of the nitrate assimilation gene cluster from oomycetes to fungi
541 [75]. We can exclude such horizontal transmission as the origin of the hxn cluster. The nearest Field Code Changed
Field Code Changed
542 paralogue of all the genes comprised in the cluster is another fungal gene, usually in the same
543 organism (data to be presented elsewhere, Bokor, Flipphi, Ámon, Scazzocchio and Hamari,
544 unpublished results).
545 One exception to this is the incorporation of an intronless nitroreductase gene into the hxn
546 cluster of most Aspergilli of the section nigri and its presence outside the cluster in four other
547 Aspergilli including A. nidulans. A phylogenetic analysis (not shown) establishes that this
24
548 gene originates from a horizontal transfer from a cyanobacterium to an ancestral member of
549 the Leotiomyceta (42 % and 41 % identity shared by the enzymes from A. niger and A.
550 nidulans, respectively, with nfsA product from Anabaena variabilis, see [76] for a comparison
551 of fungal- and bacterial nitroreductases). Its incorporation within the hxn cluster of some
552 Aspergilli is quite intriguing. It may be relevant that many nitroreductases are involved in the
553 degradation of nitro-heterocyclic compounds [77].
554 We have only presented a detailed phylogenetic analysis for HxA/HxnS, but work to be
555 detailed elsewhere (Bokor, Flipphi, Ámon, Scazzocchio and Hamari, unpublished results)
556 suggests that with the one exception mentioned, all genes in the hxn cluster have originated
557 from duplications within the Pezizomycotina, and that clustering followed or was
558 synchronous with duplication. Similar evolutionary patterns for the clusters were described in
559 fungi. A pattern of gene duplication and clustering underlies the origin and variable
560 arrangement of the alc (ethanol utilisation) gene cluster in the Aspergilli [78]. These patterns
561 of gene clustering resembles those to the one described in plants, where genes organised in
562 clusters involved in secondary metabolism originate from duplication of non-clustered genes
563 of primary metabolism ([79-81] and references therein).
564
565 4. Materials and Methods
566
567 4.1. Strains, media and growth conditions
568 The A. nidulans strains used and/or constructed in this work are listed in Table S5. Standard
569 genetic markers are described in http://www.fgsc.net/Aspergillus/gene_list/. Complete media
570 (CM) and Minimal Media with glucose as carbon source (MM) supplemented with different
571 N-sources were used [12, 82]. The media were supplemented according to the requirements of
572 each auxotrophic strain (www.fgsc.net). Nitrogen sources, inducers, repressors and inhibitors
25
573 were used at the following concentrations: 10 mM sodium nitrate, 10 mM nicotinate (1:100
574 dilution from 1 M nicotinic acid dissolved in 1 M sodium hydroxide), 10 mM 6-OH nicotinic
575 acid (1:100 dilution from 1 M 6-OH nicotinic acid dissolved in 1 M sodium hydroxide), 10
576 mM 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, 1 mM hypoxanthine, 5 mM L-(+)diammonium-tartrate, 5 mM
577 urea, 1 mM acetamide as sole N-sources; 1 mM or 100 µM nicotinic acid sodium salt, 1 mM
578 or 100 µM 6-OH nicotinic acid, 100 µM 2,5-dihydroxypyridine and 0.6 mM uric acid as
579 inducers; 5 mM L-(+)diammonium-tartrate as repressor; 5.5 µM allopurinol as inhibitor of
580 Purine hydroxylase I (encoded by hxA) enzyme activity. Cesium chloride at 12.5 mM final
581 concentration was used in mutagenesis experiments to reduce the background growth of the
582 nitrogen-source non-utilizer strains
583 (http://www.fgsc.net/Aspergillus/gene_list/supplement.html#other). The strains were
584 maintained on CM, otherwise MM with various N-sources were used in the experiments
585 supplemented with the required vitamins. The mycelia for protein extraction were grown for
586 14 hours at 37°C shaken at 150 r.p.m. in MM with acetamide or urea as nitrogen sources and
587 induced when appropriate after 12 hours growth with 6-OH nicotinate. For mRNA extraction
588 mycelia was grown on acetamide or urea N-sources were used for growth for 10 hours at
589 37°C with 150 r.p.m. and after 8 hours of growth nicotinic acid, 6-OH nicotinic acid or uric
590 acid was added to the medium as inducer and ammonium as repressor. For total DNA
591 extraction mycelia were grown in MM with nitrate as a N-source.
592
593 4.2. Mutagenesis
594 For UV mutagenesis 109 conidia of A. nidulans strains HZS.98, HZS.248 and HZS.418 in 20
595 ml 0.01 % Tween (in Petri dish with 14.5 cm diameter) were exposed to UV light (Philips
596 TUV15W 9L1, 254 nm) with gentle shaking (50 r.p.m.) for 20 minutes resulting in 95 % kill.
597 For 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) mutagenesis conidia of HZS.248 were mutagenized as
26
598 previously described [83]. Spores were plated on MM with hypoxanthine as sole nitrogen
599 source supplemented with 5.5 <U+F06D>M allopurinol and 12.5 mM cesium chloride. Strains able to
600 grow on this medium were expected to be hxnR constitutive (hxnRc) mutants. Presence of
601 allopurinol resulted in the complete inhibition of Purine hydroxylase I (encoded by hxA) in a
602 recipient hxA+ strain (HZS.98), therefore the hypoxanthine utilization must result from the
603 activity of Purine hydroxylase II (encoded by hxnS), which requires either induction by
604 nicotinate or 6-OH nicotinate or the presence of a constitutive mutation in the hxnR gene. In
605 the hxA+ strain HZS.98 gain of function allopurinol resistant mutations at the hxA locus also
606 may occur. The hxnR+ hxA-linked-allopurinol-resistant mutants however show reduced
607 growth on hypoxanthine compared to hxA+ hxnRc mutants [1, 27].
608
609 4.3. Staining for enzyme activity in gels
610 Crude protein samples of mycelia were obtained from 300 ml liquid cultures incubated at
611 37°C with 180 r.p.m. agitation for 20 hours, and induced after 15 hours growth with inducers
612 when appropriate. Protein extraction was carried out as previously described [84]. The
613 concentrations of crude protein samples were determined by the Bradford assay [85]. Native
614 10 % PAGE using 0.025 M Tris, 0.19 M glycine catode buffer pH8.3 according to Laemmli
615 [86] were used to fractionate the crude extracts, containing 50 <U+F06D>g of protein/well. HxA and
616 HxnS specific activities were detected by staining with hypoxanthine-tetrazolium [1],
617 nicotinate-tetrazolium (100 mM pyrophosphate pH9.4, 1.27 mg/ml iodonitrotetrazolium
618 chloride and 0.5 mg/ml nicotinic acid) while the diaphorase activity was detected with
619 NADH-tetrazolium [15, 87].

621 4.4. DNA and RNA manipulations
27
622 Total DNA was prepared from A. nidulans as described by Specht et al. [88]. For Southern
623 blots [89] hybond-N membranes (Amersham/GE Healthcare) were used and hybridizations
624 were done by DIG DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
625 instructions. Transformations of A. nidulans protoplasts were done as described by Karacsony
626 et al. [84] using a 4% solution of Glucanex (Novozymes, Switzerland) in 0.7 M KCl. For
627 cloning procedures, E. coli JM109 [90] and KS272 [91] was used and transformation of E.
628 coli was performed according to Hanahan [92]. Plasmid extraction from E. coli and other
629 DNA manipulations were done as described by Sambrook et al. [89]. Total RNA was isolated
630 using a NucleoSpin RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and RNase-Free DNase (Qiagen)
631 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis was carried out with a mixture
632 of oligo-dT and random primers using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
633 (Fermentas). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out
634 in a CFX96 Real Time PCR System (BioRad) with SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR Master
635 Mix (Fermentas) reaction mixture (94°C 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 94°C 15 sec and
636 60°C 1 min). Specific primers are listed in Table S6. Data processing was done by the
637 standard curve method [93]. Northern blot analysis was performed using the glyoxal method
638 [89]. In Northern blots, equal RNA loading was calculated by optical density measurements
639 (260/280 nm). [32P]-dCTP labelled gene specific DNA molecules were used as gene probes
640 using the random hexanucleotide-primer kit following the supplier’s instructions (Roche
641 Applied Science). DNA sequencing was done by the Sanger sequencing service of LGC
642 (http://www.lgcgroup.com). Used primers are listed in Table S6.
643
644 4.5. Gene deletions (for details see the Supplementary Materials and Methods)
645 Deletion of hxnR and hxnS were obtained by Chaveroce's method [91], which uses phage <U+F06C>
646 Red expressing E. coli strain (KS272) for obtaining the gene replacement by introducing a
28
647 plasmid carrying the candidate gene and a PCR product of a transformation marker gene
648 flanked with 50 bp regions of homology with the target DNA into the E. coli strain. The
649 obtained recombinant plasmid is then used for A. nidulans transformation in order to obtain an
650 allelic exchange between the mutant allele on the plasmid and the wild-type locus. Detailed
651 procedure is written in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. The first available hxnS<U+F044>
652 strain (HZS.106 and its progeny HZS.254 used in the enzyme assays) was unfortunately
653 found to carry additional ectopic copies of the recombinant plasmid, therefore a new hxnS<U+F044>
654 strain (HZS.599) was obtained by the gene substitution method using the double-joint PCR
655 [94] for constructing the gene substitution cassette (see Supplementary Materials and
656 Methods). All the genetic work and growth tests were done with the new hxnS<U+F044> strain.
657
658 4.6. In silico analysis
659 Sequence searches were carried in both general (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and
660 specialised data bases (http://www.aspgd.org/, http://genome.jgi-
661 psf.org/programs/fungi/index.jsf). We used (with permission) the following DNA sequences
662 from the JGI database, in every case the gene models were manually derived by ourselves:

1108 Figure 1. Metabolic cross-talk between the purine- and nicotinate utilisation pathways.
1109 PHI is a conventional xanthine dehydrogenase able to catalyse the conversion of
1110 hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. XanA is an <U+F061>-ketoglutarate-dependent
1111 xanthine dioxygenase, accepting xanthine but not hypoxanthine as a substrate. From there uric
1112 acid is converted to ammonium (NH4+) by the well-established purine utilisation pathway
1113 ([109] for review). PHII is an unconventional MOCO carrying enzyme hydroxylating
1114 hypoxanthine to xanthine and nicotinic acid to presumably 6-OH nicotinic acid. As this latter
1115 compound is a nitrogen source, it is presumably converted to ammonium, which is indicated
1116 by a dashed blue connector. Note that unlike PHI, PHII cannot use xanthine as a substrate. In
1117 black: steps induced by uric acid, under the control of the UaY transcription factor. In blue:

1122 Figure 2. A comparison of PHI (HxA) and PHII (HxnS). An alignment of the two A.
1123 nidulans open reading frames with the structurally characterised XDH from B. taurus [22] is
1124 shown. Underlying the sequences: yellow, 2Fe/2S clusters; blue, FAD/NAD binding domain;
1125 red, MOCO/substrate binding sub-domains I and II (as in [26]). Red arrows underlying the
1126 sequences indicate intron positions in the hxA gene, while green arrows indicate intron
1127 positions in hxnS. Boxed residues: yellow, conserved Cys in the 2Fe/2S clusters, also
1128 indicated the Glu45 and Gly46 (in B. taurus) residues belonging to the 2Fe/2S binding loop,
1129 and separating this cluster from the flavin binding ring; orange, FAD binding residues [22];
41
1130 blue, NAD+/NADH interacting residues [110]; green, residues interacting with MOCO [26];
1131 red, residues where HxnS and its putative orthologues differ from both HxA and typical
1132 XDHs represented by the B. taurus enzyme. Red asterisks mark residues involved in substrate
1133 binding of B. taurus XDH [22, 23, 111]. Blue asterisks mark residues lining the substrate
1134 access channel of B. taurus XDH [111]. Green asterisks mark residues hydrogen bonding a
1135 molydenum bound oxygen [23]. Red downward arrows indicate mutational changes leading
1136 to complete loss of function in HxA, blue downward arrows indicate mutations leading to
1137 changes of substrate- and inhibitor specificity in HxA [27], the downward green arrow
1138 indicates the only extant missense mutation sequenced for HxnS. Alignment with MAFFT E-

1142 Above each column we indicate the relevant mutation carried by each tested strain. Hx
1143 indicates 1 mM hypoxanthine as sole nitrogen source. Hx Allp, as above including 5.5 µM
1144 allopurinol, which fully inhibits PHI (HxA) but not PHII (HxnS). NA, 6-NA, and 2,5-DP
1145 indicate respectively nicotinic acid and 6-OH nicotinic acid added as the sodium salts (see
1146 Materials and Methods) and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine added as powder. Other relevant
1147 concentrations are indicated in the figure. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 37° C except
1148 those marked by asterisk (*), which were incubated for 4 days. Strains used: control 1
1149 (HZS.120, parent of hxnS<U+0394>), control 2 (TN02 A21) are wt for all hxn genes. Mutant strains:
1150 hxnS<U+0394> (HZS.599), hxB20 (HZS.135), hxnR<U+0394> (HZS.136), hxnR80 (HZS.220) and hxnRc7
1151 (FGSC A872). The complete genotypes are given in Table S5.

1161 of constitutivity of hxnRc mutants. (A) A schematic representation of the HxnR
1162 transcription factor is shown indicating the two Cys2His2 Zn-finger domains (C2H2, in
1163 purple), the putative nuclear localisation signal (NLS, in orange), the putative nuclear export
1164 signal (NES, in yellow), the fungal transcription factor domain (pfam04082, in blue) and the
1165 two regions where the constitutive mutations occur (in green). The three extant loss-of-
1166 function mutations are indicated in red letters in the scheme. All the amino acid changes
1167 leading to constitutivity are indicated, together with the cognate allele number (in green). (B)
1168 Enzyme activity staining for hypoxanthine hydroxylase (Hx) and nicotinate hydroxylase (NA)
1169 of the constitutive mutants is shown. Only HxnS (PHII), which has a lower mobility than
1170 HxA (PHI) stains with nicotinate as substrate. Note its complete absence in the wt strain
1171 hxnR+ hxA+ grown under non-inducing conditions, while HxA shows substantial basal levels
1172 as reported previously [1, 112]. As the constitutive mutations were isolated in different hxA
1173 backgrounds (hxA18, hxA<U+0394>, hxA+, see Materials and Methods and Table S2) this is also
1174 indicated. All mycelia were grown in non-inducing conditions (for either HxA or HxnS) on 1
1175 mM acetamide as nitrogen source for 15 hours at 37°C.

1177 Figure 6. Co-regulation of the genes in the hxn cluster. (A) mRNA levels measured by
1178 qRT-PCR for all the genes in the hxn cluster. Mycelia were grown on 1 mM acetamide as sole
1179 nitrogen source for 8 hours at 37°C. They were either maintained on the same medium for a
43
1180 further 2 hours (non-induced, NI) or induced with 1 mM nicotinic acid (as the sodium salt, I)
1181 or induced as above together with 5 mM of L-(+)diammonium-tartrate (induced-repressed,
1182 IR). Strains used: hxnR+ (FGSC A26), hxnR<U+0394> (HZS.136) and hxnRc7 (FGSC A872). (B)
1183 Northern blot showing qualitatively the co-regulation of all the genes in the cluster under
1184 different growth conditions. Mycelia were grown on 500 µM urea for 8 hours, then
1185 transferred to 1 mM acetamide for an additional 2 hours (non-induced, NI) or to the same plus
1186 1 mM nicotinic acid (as above, I) or to the latter together with 5 mM L-(+)diammonium-
1187 tartrate (induced repressed, IR). Together with hxnS, hxnR, hxnT, hxnP, hxnY and hxnZ
1188 transcripts we also monitored the expression of hxB, an unlinked gene, which was previously
1189 shown to be under the control of HxnR [37]. As a loading control, the expression of acnA
1190 (actin) was monitored. Strains used are indicated by the relevant mutation: hxnR+ (FGSC
1191 A26), hxnR2 (CS302) a missense unleaky mutation (Gly76Asp) and hxnRc7 (FGSC A872)
1192 our standard constitutive mutation (figure 5, figure S4 and Table S2). (C) Expression of hxnS
1193 and hxnP under conditions of nitrogen starvation. Mycelia were grown on 5 mM urea as sole
1194 nitrogen source for 8 hours, then transferred to the same medium for 2 additional hours (U,
1195 which are is non-inducing and actually partially repressed conditions, see text) or to a medium
1196 without any nitrogen source (starvation media, St) or to a medium with 10 mM nicotinic acid
1197 as nitrogen source (inducing media, I). Strains as in panel A. In all qRT-PCR experiments
1198 data were processed according to the standard curve method with acnA as the control mRNA.
1199 Standard errors of three independent experiments are shown in all qRT-PCR. Gene probe
1200 primers are detailed in Table S6. (D) Cluster arrangement of the hxn genes on chromosome

1205 and hxnS mRNA levels in areA+ (FGSC A26), an areA supposedly derepressed mutant
1206 (xprD1, HZS.216) and an areA null mutant (areA600, CS3095) strains. Non-induced
1207 conditions (NI): Strains were grown on MM media with 5 mM L-(+)diammonium-tartrate as
1208 sole N-source for 8 hours, then the mycelia were transferred to MM with 1 mM acetamide for
1209 further 2 hours. Induced conditions (I): as above but transferred to 10 mM nicotinic acid as
1210 sole N-source. Induced repressed conditions (IR): transferred to 10 mM nicotinic acid and 5
1211 mM di-ammonium tartrate. N-starvation conditions (St): transferred to nitrogen-free medium.
1212 (B) Induction depends on metabolism of nicotinic acid via HxnS activity. mRNA levels of
1213 hxnP and hxnS in hxnR+ hxB+ (FGSC A26), hxnR+ hxB20 (HZS.135), hxnR<U+F044> hxB+ (HZS.136)
1214 and hxnR constitutive, hxnRc7 hxB+ (FGSC A872) strains are shown. Non-induced (NI) and
1215 induced growth conditions were the same as detailed in Panel A. (NA): induced with 1 mM
1216 nicotinic acid; (6-NA): induced with 1 mM 6-OH nicotinic acid. The hxB20 mutation
1217 abolishes completely HxnS activity without affecting its expression as judged by measuring
1218 its CRM [11]. qRT-PCR data in both panels were processed according to the standard curve
1219 method, the housekeeping control transcript was actin (acnA). Standard deviations based on
1220 three biological replicates are shown.

1237 lower mobility than the HxA band and stains with nicotinate as substrate. Growth conditions
1238 'acam' indicates 1 mM acetamide as the sole nitrogen source, strains were grown at 37° C for
1239 15 hours, after which they were, where indicated, induced with 6-NA (6-OH nicotinic acid as
1240 the sodium salt) and further incubated for 5 hours. 'Urea' indicates growth on 5mM urea, with
1241 or without induction with 600 µM uric acid, which induces only HxA (Urea+UA). (B) HxnS

1244 Mutational changes of strains used in these experiments. hxnR<U+0394> and hxnS<U+0394> constructions are
1245 described in Materials and Methods. hxnS29, hxnS35 and hxnS41 were isolated as described
1246 in Scazzocchio et al. [1]. hxnS35 is a five base pair deletion between DNA positions 182 and
1247 185 after the ATG, resulting in stop codon at residue 98, hxnS41 is a double mutant (G3064T
1248 plus a deletion of 3066) resulting in a chain termination at residue 1162, while hxnS29
1249 (T3668C) results in a Phe1213Ser change in a conserved region (figure 2). Used strains in
1250 Panel A: hxnR+ parental (TN02 A21), hxnR80 (HZS.220), hxnR<U+F044> (HZS.136) and hxnR+

1257 Figure S2. Comparison of the modelled substrate binding site of HxA and HxnS with
1258 that of the Bos taurus Xanthine dehydrogenase. (A) A comparison of the modelled
1259 substrate binding site of HxA with that of the Bos taurus xanthine dehydrogenase, shown in a
1260 complex with the inhibitor oxypurinol ([113] 3BDJ in the PDB database
1261 (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=3BDJ)). Active site residues of the B. taurus
1262 enzyme are shown solid and colour coded, the corresponding residues of HxA are shown in
1263 red in CPK format. The residue numbers of the B. taurus enzyme are indicated, and next to it
1264 in parenthesis the corresponding residue of HxA. MOCO indicates the molybdenum co-factor
1265 and OXP the oxypurinol molecule. (B) The same comparison as in Panel A with the
1266 corresponding residues of modelled HxnS, shown in grey. (C) A superposition of the HxA
1267 and the HxnS modelled substrate binding sites, colour coded as in panels A and B. (D) A
1268 superposition of substrate binding residues of the B. taurus enzyme with that of HxA (red)
1269 and HxnS (grey), only Phe914 (HxA945, HxnS, 968) Phe1009 (HxA1040, HxnS 1064) and
1270 Thr 1010 (HxA1041, HxnS1066) are shown in an orientation such as to clearly visualise the
1271 different positioning of Thr residue in relation to oxypurinol in HxA and HxnS. We note in
1272 panel A, but more clearly in panel D the changed orientation of Phe1040 of HxA while
1273 Phe1064 of HxnS has exactly the same orientation as Phe1009 of the B. taurus enzyme. If this
1274 is a genuine difference it cannot affect the specificity or functionality of the enzyme, which is
1275 a completely orthodox XDH, with some differences with the B. taurus XDH in the kinetics of
1276 allopurinol and oxypurinol inhibition [7, 8]. HxA and HxnS were modelled with I-Tasser (see
1277 Materials and Methods), the most probable models were chosen in each case. For HxA C-
1278 score 0.63, Estimated TM-score 0.80±0.09, Estimated RMSD 8.1±4 Å. For HxnS C-score
47
1279 0.83, Estimated TM-score 0.83±0.08, Estimated RMSD 7.7±4.4 Å. The two modelled
1280 proteins and the monomer of the 3BDJ structure were super-imposed with the multi-seq
1281 facility included in VMD, which was used to visualise the active site residues (see Materials
1282 and Methods).

1293 extant (comprising 3D structural work for Bos taurus XDH). In green lettering we indicate
1294 proteins, which are in positions that do not correspond to the taxonomically appropriate
1295 position of the organism in question. Searches for genes encoding XDH-like proteins were
1296 carried out with both HxA and HxnS of A. nidulans as in silico probes. All fungal gene
1297 models and proteins were deduced manually. The auto-annotated accession numbers were
1298 curated as indicated in S1 Table (a considerable number of them are miscalled). The proteins
1299 were aligned with MAFFT E-INS-i (for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long
1300 gaps) with the default parameters. The alignment was curated with BMGE with a Blosum 30
1301 similarity matrix. The Maximum Likelihood phylogeny was carried out with PhyML 3.0 with
1302 automatic model selection (LG substitution model selected). Numbers at nodes indicate
1303 aLRTs (approximate Likelihood Ratio test values).
