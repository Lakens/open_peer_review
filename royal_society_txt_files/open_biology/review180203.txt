Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The work by Verstreken et al. brings us one step closer to understanding of the mechanisms that
control pluripotency and lineage commitment in stem cells.
While specific chemical cues are thought to be the major contributors to these processes, recent
studies in embryonic and adult stem cells point to spatial and mechanical constraints as generic
signals guiding cell fate decisions in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, the authors decided
to investigate the contribution of cell stretching – a type of mechanical perturbations that cells
often experience naturally (e.g. in mechanically active tissues such as the skin and muscles, or
during spreading of rounded cells upon completion of mitosis) or in response to acute
environmental insults. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), Verstreken et al. found that
naïve pluripotent mESC are buffered against mechanical inputs, because their pluripotency
program and global transcription remain largely unaffected by cell stretching. However, as the
cells exit the naïve state, they undergo a transition that renders them susceptible to stretching and
significantly changes their transcriptional repertoire. This highlights a fundamental difference in
mechanical properties and/or mechanosensing mechanisms of naïve vs. exiting the naïve
pluripotency state mESCs. To reach these conclusions, the authors developed a stretching device
that can be printed on most basic 3D printers and whose design plan is publicly available.
Moreover, Verstreken et al. generated large datasets of transcriptional profiles for naïve vs.
exiting the naïve pluripotency state mESCs in response to stretching, which can be of great
interest to stem cell research and cell biophysics communities. These aspects, together with the
outcomes of the study, align well with the philosophy of Open Biology, and thus the manuscript
merits its publication in the journal.
Major comments:
1) I apologize if I missed this throughout the manuscript, but I was curious to see whether
calcium concentration changes are evident in response to acute stretching (short time scales) and
repetitive stretching after the initial stimulus (long time scales) in mESCs exiting the naïve
pluripotency state.
2) Relevant to the previous remark, I would recommend to add to the Conclusion section a few
sentences discussing a potential mechanism for differential mechanosensitivity in naïve vs.
exiting the naïve pluripotency state mESCs. Why is it so that naïve cells sense stretching at short
time scales (as follows from changes in calcium concentration reported in Fig. 2b) and become
insensitive to the stimulus at longer time scales? Considering that calcium concentration changes
are typically associated with the activity of stretch-sensitive calcium channels present on the
plasma membrane and endomembranes, this would imply that the relatively fast turnover rates
of the plasma membrane can dampen any changes in tensional homeostasis and thus desensitize
3
cells to membrane stretch at longer time scales. If so, can it be that cells exiting the naïve state
acquire changes in their plasma membrane composition and/or turnover? This is just an idea; it
might well be that there are other scenarios in place, but I felt a discussion of this sort would be
helpful to illustrate to the reader that the results of this work could guide our experimental
intuition in probing deeper into details the molecular mechanisms behind apparently distinct
biophysical properties of naïve vs. exiting the naïve pluripotency state mESCs.
Minor comments:
On page 12, I would write that “p-Pax is a marker of mature integrin-based adhesions”, rather
than “a component of mature integrins”.

Appendix A
We thank the reviewer for taking the time to provide very useful the
comments on our submitted manuscripts. We address the points of the
reviewer below:
Point 1
I apologize if I missed this throughout the manuscript, but I was curious
to see whether calcium concentration changes are evident in response
to acute stretching (short time scales) and repetitive stretching after the
initial stimulus (long time scales) in mESCs exiting the naïve
pluripotency state.
In our paper we investigated the changes in the concentration of intracellular
calcium of cells in Serum+LIF, in which most cells have not left the pluripotent
state. We did not study the calcium response as cells are exiting naïve
pluripotency (i.e. N2B27). In the relevant section we have clarified that the
study of the calcium changes was carried out in Serum+LIF. However, we
agree that as a future study it would indeed be interesting to investigate the
calcium responses in other media conditions.
Point 2
Relevant to the previous remark, I would recommend to add to the
Conclusion section a few sentences discussing a potential mechanism
for differential mechanosensitivity in naïve vs. exiting the naïve
pluripotency state mESCs. Why is it so that naïve cells sense stretching
at short time scales (as follows from changes in calcium concentration
reported in Fig. 2b) and become insensitive to the stimulus at longer
time scales? Considering that calcium concentration changes are
typically associated with the activity of stretch-sensitive calcium
channels present on the plasma membrane and endomembranes, this
would imply that the relatively fast turnover rates of the plasma
membrane can dampen any changes in tensional homeostasis and thus
desensitize cells to membrane stretch at longer time scales. If so, can it
be that cells exiting the naïve state acquire changes in their plasma
membrane composition and/or turnover? This is just an idea; it might
well be that there are other scenarios in place, but I felt a discussion of
this sort would be helpful to illustrate to the reader that the results of
this work could guide our experimental intuition in probing deeper into
details the molecular mechanisms behind apparently distinct
biophysical properties of naïve vs. exiting the naïve pluripotency state
mESCs.
This is a very good point, and we have added a short discussion in the
Conclusions to raise the possibility that changes in the regulation of plasma
membrane could cause changes in the stretch responses as cells exit
pluripotency. We are also now citing Wang G, Galli T. Reciprocal link
between cell biomechanics and exocytosis. Traffic 2018;19:741–9, which
strengthens the point as well. The new text in the discussion reads as follows:
“Nevertheless, the intracellular calcium concentration was unaffected
by subsequent stretches. Considering the role of stretch-activated
calcium channels in regulating intracellular calcium concentration, this
desensitization could be caused by adaptation of cellular properties,
for example membrane tension, to mechanical stress. Indeed, strain
on the membrane induced by stretching can lead to exocytosis, which
would lead to a decrease in membrane tension and lower
responsiveness of stretch-activated channels. Moreover, if there is a
difference in the regulation of membrane turnover or tension between
naïve ES cells and differentiating cells, as differences in morphology
would suggest, this difference could affect sensitivity to dynamic
mechanical stresses.”
