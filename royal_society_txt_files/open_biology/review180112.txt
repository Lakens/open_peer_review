This is a very comprehensive review of Cyclin-CDK structures that will be an excellent point of
reference. The authors have been very thorough in their analyses of structures and in their
citation of relevant papers. As a non-structural biologist, I found some of the figures took some
time to comprehend on paper, though perhaps the 3-D rendering of molecular structures on line
make it easier to see where there are steric clashes and the nature of binding interactions. I have
two specific comments:
Firstly, the Introduction would benefit from a table listing the CDKs, their cognate Cyclins, and
their known interactors. Secondly, the Mediator complex is referred to as Fig 11b in the text but
missing from the Figures. As a consequence the HSP90 complex is referred to as Fig11c but
appears in panel b.
Minor points:
A glossary of abbreviations (R.M.S.D., etc) would be helpful.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
This is a comprehensive review of the structures determined to date of different CDK-cyclin
complexes, of the biological roles of these complexes (and insights that can be gained from the
structures), and of two of the larger CDK-cyclin complexes known to be formed (CDK8-cyclin C
in Mediator complex and CDK4 bound to Hsp90/Cdc37). It covers the canonical CDK fold and
activation of this fold by cyclin (exemplified by CDK2-cyclin A), and compares the structures and
function of many CDK-cyclin complexes in a knowledgeable manner. The review continues to
discuss the interactions of the CDK-cyclin complexes with substrate (including substrate
specificity via RXL motif), regulatory proteins (particularly the CKI protein inhibitors) and
members of protein degradation pathways (such as the APC/C and Skp1-Cullin-Fbox E3 ligases).
It also covers protein-protein interaction surfaces between transcriptional CDK-cyclin complexes
and other binding partners; roles for CDK4/6-cyclin D and cyclins A, D and E outside control of
the cell cycle; mutations / splicing variants found in disease and the structure of two complexes
containing subunits beyond CDK-cyclin.
The review is authoritative, clear, well written and I enjoyed reading it. The figures are
appropriate and mostly well-labelled – I have included some comments below where I think
clarity may be improved. Occasionally there are sentences in the main text which are written
‘back-to-front’. In these sentences the conclusion is presented in the first half of the sentence,
followed by a comma, and the justification or qualifier is presented after this. These sentences
would almost always be clearer ordered with the qualifier first and the conclusion second. There
are very few typos in the manuscript – although please could the authors search carefully for
missing parentheses (eg p3 line 48).
The comments below are essentially minor and may improve clarity.
Please could the authors be a little more explicit in the main text about the novel routes to therapy
identified by the structures (mentioned at the end of the summary) as and when they arise? This
does not need to be extensive, and single sentences and/or references would be sufficient.
Introduction: The first paragraph of the introduction sets the scene with all 20 CDKs, and gives
functions for many of them (or refers to less well characterised functions). However CDKs 5, 10
and 11 are not mentioned here by name which is a shame (particularly as CDK5 is discussed in
detail later on in the review in section 2.4.2). Please could reference be made to them here (even if
only under ‘other kinases’).
p4 line 85-87. There is quite a jump from first to second paragraphs of this section (ie from CDK2
to CDK16). Rewording the first two sentences of the second paragraph would help here to start
with CDK2 and indicate why this model is not appropriate for the CDK5-sub-branch of the
family. Different phylogenetic sub-branches of the CDK family have not yet been discussed (only
functional groupings) – would a phylogenetic tree in figure 1 help here? (please also see
comments on figure 1 below).
4
p5 line 101: I presume the authors mean that CAK phosphorylates CDK2 on Thr160 on the
activation loop. If this is correct, it would help to say this explicitly.
p6 Section 2.3: This section has quite a broad title (extending the activation model to other
members of CDK family) but appears to compare only CDK1 and CDK2 in complex with a range
of different cyclins. Please could the authors use a more focussed title?
p7 line 155. Is there a difference between loop flexibility and accessibility to phosphatases? Surely
something inflexible can be dephosphorylated as long as it is surface exposed?
p8 line 179 and p22 line 532: The extent to which…
p8 line 181: I don’t understand the sentence beginning ‘Monomeric…’ . I presume the authors are
giving suitable caveats about the mechanisms of activation they outline in the following
paragraphs, but is eg CDK4-cyclin D3 (3G33) not a monomeric CDK with a cognate cyclin? (There
is a crystallographic dimer interface between the cyclins, but not between the CDKs.) Please
could the authors rephrase.
p10 line 219: There is a discontinuity between the argument of structural conservation between
CDK4/6 at the end of the previous paragraph and the first sentence of this paragraph.
p11 line 258 and p12 line 276: CDK11 and CDK10 are mentioned here in terms of their functional
roles but are not highlighted in eg the title. Please could the authors be explicit that there are no
PDB structures of either of these kinases (cyclin-bound or otherwise).
p13 line 299: to me, figure 4 shows the presence and location of the kinase C-terminal tail. It
doesn’t indicate that the tail affects the character of the ATP binding site. If the authors wish to
illustrate this, please could they provide a new figure / new panel(s) perhaps showing a close-up
of the relevant side-chains and their contribution to the ATP binding site.
p14 line 321: it would help if the authors highlighted the P-site in figure 3d, and also the direction
of P+ and P-.
p17 line 399: the word ‘inhibitor’ is missing from the explanation of the CKI acronym.
Typography of p27KIP1 is inconsistent with the typography in figure 5a.
p17 line 403: please could the authors refer to the beta strand by its number (illustrated in figure 1
insert) rather than refer to the ‘edge beta-strand’. Is the temporal order of p27KIP1 binding
(upper surface then strand displacement then ATP binding site) known, or is this a description of
the structure working eg N->C terminus?
p17 line 407: status, not statues
p18 line: 429 dephosphorylate, not dephosphorylated
p20 lines 488-490: these two first sentences seem to contradict each other?
p24 lines 568-570: the analogy with tyrosine kinases as written does not hold. The authors are
appearing to argue that, in tyrosine kinases, substrate specificity is achieved partially through
spatial localisation. This is a different argument to arguing that CDK4 and CDK6 may have
scaffolding functions in their non-cell cycle roles. It is also unclear why we would expect the roles
of CDK4/6 in the regulation of inflammatory response genes to be independent of catalytic
activity per se – is there evidence for this, or does it follow from being a non-canonical substrate,
or from possible absence of cyclin D (but cyclin D alone does not activate CDK4)??
p27 first two paragraphs – the reference to figure 10 would make more sense as part of the
discussion about the mutations in the next paragraph rather than in the introductory paragraph.
Please could the authors insert a sentence to make it clear that there are no structures of CDK4 /
p16INK4A and to link to the relevance of the CDK6/p16INK4A structure in the figure.
Figures
Figure 1: This figure appears to show the conserved kinase domain, together with some flanking
regions. However, it is not clear from either the text (p4 line 72) or the figure legend whether the
sequence alignment is for the kinase domain alone, or for the full-length sequence (I read the
main text to suggest that the sequences in figure 1 illustrated the differing lengths of N and C
termini which is not the case). Other than marking a number of the structural motifs (but not the
activation loop Thr) on the sequence of CDK1 and 2 (is there a reason why they are not marked
on the sequence of the other CDKs?), and indicating sequence conservation (which is not
5
discussed in the main text – eg to what extent are the conserved residues CDK-specific and to
what extent are they conserved elsewhere in the kinome?), I am not clear what this figure adds to
the review. The structural insert provides a useful indication of the labelling of the different
helices / sheets, but perhaps this information could be included in eg figure 2a (which otherwise
duplicates the mapping of motifs to structure).
Figure 2: Please could N- and C- lobes be marked in panel a. Since Thr160 is mentioned many
times in the main text, marking this residue would also be helpful. Panel b gets quite crowded
(especially in the centre). Would putting some distance / perspective in here help the eye to see
the kinase fold? Please can the authors include a figure legend for panel c (or indicate which part
of the existing legend is appropriate). Panel d is referred to in the main text, but not in the figure
or figure legend. Additionally, this legend is quite long – could the argument about estimating
mobility from electron density be made in the main text? Electron density is not indicated in
figure 2, so reference to it does not directly aid our understanding of the structures presented.
Figure 3: It is quite hard to distinguish the two superposed structures in panel a and b. Perhaps
depth perspective and / or a different choice of colours would help. Additionally, the specular
reflections on the surface of the cyclins come across as spots rather than aiding the interpretation
of contours (this is the case in eg figure 5 as well). In panel d, it is hard to distinguish the colours
of CDK2-spy1 and pThr160 CDK2-cyclin A – would adjusting one of these to orange help? The
figure legend for panel a has a large amount of detailed text comparing active and inactive
conformations of CDK2 which would probably be better in the main text.
Figure 4: I presume that the activation loop is not resolved in many of the structures (and hence
not highlighted in panels b, c, e-h). If this is the case, please could the authors mention this in the
figure legend – ‘activation loop shown in red where resolved in the structure’ would be sufficient.
In panel b, it would help to colour the LXCXE motif to indicate its location (similarly to the RXL
motif).
Figure 6: Orange is used for the side chains of cyclin A and the ‘CDC6 peptide’ text. Presumably
the text should be yellow to match the peptide chain?
Figure 7: I find some of the text on this figure confusing. Eg ‘Tat C-terminal’ is labelled twice in
panel a (one at each end of the peptide) and similarly ‘AFF4 C-terminal’ is labelled twice in panel
b (right). Are these labels indicating the C-terminus (terminus not terminal) and is one of them
redundant? Similarly should ‘cyclin T C-terminal’ in panel b (left) be C-terminus?
Figure 8: panel a has no legend. It is also very hard to see the 3D arrangement of the helices as
drawn. In panel b, the label should presumably read LXCXE motif.
Figure 11: three panels are referred to in the text, but only two are shown in the figure (the
MED12 complex is not illustrated). Panel a shows the TFIIH structure (including Mat1 to which
CDK7-cyclinH binds), but does not show either the CDK nor the cyclin, nor discuss where / how
they may interact with Mat1 (through which partner? on which face?). While an interesting
structure of transcription factors, I am therefore not sure what this panel adds to the discussion
on CDK-cyclin interactions.

1.1 the Introduction would benefit from a table listing the CDKs, their cognate
Cyclins, and their known interactors.
We would like to thank the Reviewer for this comment and have now included a
Table that includes this information (new Table 1, mentioned in text at line 74). To
be consistent in the criteria we apply for each CDK, we have only included those
interactions for which there is structural information available.
CDK Partners1
CDK1 Cyclin A, Cks1, Cks2
CDK2 Cyclin A/B/E, KAP, Cks1,
p27KIP1, Spy-1

Partner proteins included in the Table are those for which CDK-complex structures
have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank.
1.2 The Mediator complex is referred to as Fig 11b in the text but missing from the
Figures. As a consequence the HSP90 complex is referred to as Fig11c but appears
in panel b.
We apologise for this mis-labelling. Given further comments from the second
Reviewer we have now revised Figure 11 so that it only shows the structure of the
CDK4-Cdc37-Hsp90 complex.
1.3 A glossary of abbreviations (R.M.S.D., etc) would be helpful.
A glossary of abbreviations has been added and is included after the Figure legends.

2.1 Missing parentheses
We have re-read the MS and corrected examples of missing parentheses.
2.2 Please could the authors be a little more explicit in the main text about the
novel routes to therapy identified by the structures (mentioned at the end of the
summary) as and when they arise? This does not need to be extensive, and single
sentences and/or references would be sufficient.
We would like to thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We have recently reviewed
CDKs as therapeutic targets (see PMID: 29118092: Structure-based discovery of
cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors, Martin MP, Endicott JA, Noble MEM.
Essays Biochem. 2017 61(5):439-452). The literature CDK inhibitors are ATP-
competitive but exploit sequence and structural differences within the CDK family to
derive potency and selectivity. Identifying which tumours are driven by aberrant
2
CDK activity is also an important consideration when developing CDK inhibitors for
clinical use. Rather than add text for each CDK individually, we would like to suggest
that we add the following text to the Concluding Remarks (highlighted in italics):
Starting at line 879:
Structural studies have revealed their distinguishing features and help to provide
explanations for their mechanistic differences. CDK-cyclin complexes have proved to
be more diverse than was originally envisaged. This structural diversity has recently
been successfully exploited to identify the first CDK inhibitors to be registered for
clinical use targeting CDK4 and CDK6 (reviewed in [32, 68]). ATP-competitive CDK
inhibitors that selectively target other family members similarly exploit sequence
differences within the active site and/or unique conformations that permit
optimisation of inhibitor–CDK interactions that discriminate the family members.
Whether these inhibitors will be useful in the clinic will require careful target
validation studies to identify cellular settings in which aberrant CDK activity is the
cancer driver.
2.3 Introduction: The first paragraph of the introduction sets the scene with all 20
CDKs, and gives functions for many of them (or refers to less well characterised
functions). However CDKs 5, 10 and 11 are not mentioned here by name which is a
shame (particularly as CDK5 is discussed in detail later on in the review in section
2.4.2). Please could reference be made to them here (even if only under ‘other
kinases’).
We initially included a short description of each CDK in the opening paragraphs of
the introduction, but decided to remove in the interests of not making this section
too long. We are happy to re-instate these introductory remarks and have included
the following text under ‘other kinases’. Some of this text has been taken from later
in the review so as not to lengthen the article.
Starting at line 38:
Other CDKs (CDKs 5, 10, 11, 14-18 and 20) have more diverse, CDK-unique functions
that are frequently tissue-specific [8]. As examples, CDK5 was one of the first CDKs to
be characterised in non-cycling cells [9]. CDK10 is implicated in regulating gene
transcription, but not through RNA pol II phosphorylation. It phosphorylates diverse
substrates including the ETS2 oncoprotein and the protein kinase PKN2 and
mutations in its cognate cyclin, cyclin M, result in STAR syndrome, a human
developmental disorder [10, 11]. CDK10 mutant and knockout mice also show
growth and developmental delays [12]. CDK11-cyclin L complexes regulate RNA
splicing, studied, for example, in the context of HIV transcript processing [13].
3
However, insights into these CDK-cyclin interactions are limited by the lack of
structures for CDK10 and CDK11 containing complexes.
2.4 p4 line 85-87. There is quite a jump from first to second paragraphs of this
section (ie from CDK2 to CDK16). Rewording the first two sentences of the second
paragraph would help here to start with CDK2 and indicate why this model is not
appropriate for the CDK5-sub-branch of the family. Different phylogenetic sub-
branches of the CDK family have not yet been discussed (only functional
groupings) – would a phylogenetic tree in figure 1 help here? (please also see
comments on figure 1 below).
We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion and have re-ordered the text. The
evolutionary relationships between the different CDKs is illustrated in a recent
review by Malumbres (PMID: 25180339). As there is no need to repeat this analysis
we have included a reference to the Malumbres review to address this comment:
Starting at Line 30:
Within the CMGC branch of the kinome, twenty proteins are now considered to be
members of the CDK family, that can be grouped into different phylogenetic sub-
branches (see [2] for criteria for inclusion, illustrated and updated in [3]).
2.5 p5 line 101: I presume the authors mean that CAK phosphorylates CDK2 on
Thr160 on the activation loop. If this is correct, it would help to say this explicitly.
It is correct and we have modified the text as follows (inserted text in italics):
At line 113:
Subsequent studies that have interrogated the kinetics of CDK2 activation in a
cellular context have demonstrated that CDK-activating kinase (CAK, a complex of
CDK7 and cyclin H in humans) is active against CDK2 (i.e. through phosphorylation of
CDK2 T160) which is then proposed to bind to cyclin A [47].
2.6 p6 Section 2.3: This section has quite a broad title (extending the activation
model to other members of CDK family) but appears to compare only CDK1 and
CDK2 in complex with a range of different cyclins. Please could the authors use a
more focussed title?
We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion and have modified the title to:
At line 138:
2.3 Extending the activation model to other cyclin partners of CDK1 and CDK2
4
2.7 p7 line 155. Is there a difference between loop flexibility and accessibility to
phosphatases? Surely something inflexible can be dephosphorylated as long as it
is surface exposed?
We agree on this point with the Reviewer and have re-written the text to clarify the
difference between CDK1 and CDK2 in this region of the activation segment:
Starting at line 172::
Though the structure of a T161-phosphorylated CDK1-cyclin B complex is yet to be
determined, this complex is susceptible to phosphatase treatment, suggesting that
the phosphorylated CDK1 activation segment remains flexible [33]. In contrast,
phosphorylated CDK2 T160 is embedded within a network of ionic interactions
(Figure 3) that orders the CDK2 activation segment within this region and decrease
T160 solvent accessibility.
2.8 p8 line 179 and p22 line 532: The extent to which…
The phrase “The extent to which….” appears once in the Introduction in the
sentence “The extent to which protein interaction sites are conserved and recycled
within the CDK and cyclin families is yet to be fully explored, but will be reviewed
here.”
We would like to keep the sentence as written.
2.9 p8 line 181: I don’t understand the sentence beginning ‘Monomeric…’ . I
presume the authors are giving suitable caveats about the mechanisms of
activation they outline in the following paragraphs, but is eg CDK4-cyclin D3
(3G33) not a monomeric CDK with a cognate cyclin? (There is a crystallographic
dimer interface between the cyclins, but not between the CDKs.) Please could the
authors rephrase.
We thank the Reviewer for this comment and are happy to explain our use of
nomenclature. We have tried to adopt a structure-justified and consistent
nomenclature throughout. Where we are describing CDK structures of the
monomeric form of the enzyme (ie no other protein partners present) we use the
term “monomeric”. In a number of cases, CDK structures have been determined of
the inactive (cyclin-free) structure where a binding partner has been required to aid
crystallisation (eg CDK1-Cks2). In these cases we have said cyclin-free CDK to make
it clear that though the structure is inactive and superimposes very well with the
conserved monomeric CDK fold, it is not strictly speaking a “monomeric CDK”
5
structure. CDK4 presents an interesting example, as it is not as the Reviewer
suggests a monomeric CDK with a cognate cyclin but a CDK-cyclin complex in which
the CDK partner does not mould to the cyclin to adopt the active conformation. So it
is cyclin-bound but adopts a structure similar to the monomeric CDK fold.
2.10 p10 line 219: There is a discontinuity between the argument of structural
conservation between CDK4/6 at the end of the previous paragraph and the first
sentence of this paragraph.
On re-reading we appreciate the discontinuity the Reviewer has highlighted. To
address this point we have modified the first sentence of the paragraph:
At line 248:
However, there are structural differences between CDK4 and CDK6 that can impact
function.
2.11 p11 line 258 and p12 line 276: CDK11 and CDK10 are mentioned here in terms
of their functional roles but are not highlighted in eg the title. Please could the
authors be explicit that there are no PDB structures of either of these kinases
(cyclin-bound or otherwise).
To address this point we have now removed all text in this Section that describes
CDK10 and CDK11 and only those CDKs for which structures are available are
included. The text that describes CDK10 and CDK11 has been moved to the
Introduction to address comment 3 from this Reviewer.
2.12 p13 line 299: to me, figure 4 shows the presence and location of the kinase C-
terminal tail. It doesn’t indicate that the tail affects the character of the ATP
binding site. If the authors wish to illustrate this, please could they provide a new
figure / new panel(s) perhaps showing a close-up of the relevant side-chains and
their contribution to the ATP binding site.
We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion we have included a new Figure (Figure 5)
that illustrates this point for the transcriptional CDKs. The remaining Figures have
been renumbered.
Starting at line 985:
Figure 5. Shaping of the catalytic cleft by the C-terminal tail in the transcriptional
CDKs. In each case, the binding of an ATP-competitive inhibitor (ball and stick model)
within the ATP-binding pocket helps to order the C-terminal sequence. (a) CDK8-
6
cyclin C-CCT251545 (PDB entry 5BNJ); (b) CDK9-cyclin T1-DRB (PDB 3MY1) overlaid
with the full length CKD9 structure (PDB 4RC8); (c) CDK12-cyclin K-THZ531 (PDB
5ACB). In this structure the inhibitor THZ531 forms an irreversible bond with C1039
located within the CDK12 C-terminal extension. The CDK8, 9 and 12 folds are
coloured green, lilac and grey respectively, and the CDK C-terminal tails are coloured
orange. The hinge region between the N- and C- -
Helix are identified to provide context.
2.13 p14 line 321: it would help if the authors highlighted the P-site in figure 3d,
and also the direction of P+ and P-.
We have modified the Figure as the Reviewer requested. We have included the P+/-
n nomenclature in Figure 3d where it is possible to do without obscuring structural
details. The direction of the peptide binding is indicated by the use of the P-X to
P+X nomenclature. We have also added the following text to the Figure 3d legend:
Starting at line 969:
The positions of residues (P-3 to P+3) within the CDC6 peptide substrate (sequence
HHASPRK) with respect to the serine residue at the site of phospho transfer (P
position) are indicated.
2.14 p17 line 399: the word ‘inhibitor’ is missing from the explanation of the CKI
acronym. Typography of p27KIP1 is inconsistent with the typography in figure 5a.
We have corrected these typographical errors. We have also made the CDC6
peptide nomenclature consistent.
2.15 p17 line 403: please could the authors refer to the beta strand by its number
(illustrated in figure 1 insert) rather than refer to the ‘edge beta-strand’. Is the
temporal order of p27KIP1 binding (upper surface then strand displacement then
ATP binding site) known, or is this a description of the structure working eg N->C
terminus?
At line 476:
- We have edited the text so that ‘edge beta strand’ is replaced with ‘edge
ß2-strand’.
The mechanism of p27KIP1 binding to CDK2-cyclin A has been explored in the group
of Richard Kriwacki (reviewed in PMID 23029651) in which they propose a folding
upon binding model for this intrinsically disordered protein initiated by engagement
7
of the p27KIP1 N-terminal RXL motif with the cyclin recruitment site. This work from
the Kriwacki group is referenced in this Section, but we agree that the inclusion of
“proceed” implies a temporal pathway that is not explored in the text. As going into
greater detail about the experimental data supporting this model is outside the
scope of this review, we would like to suggest that we rephrase so that the text
reads as a description of the structure working N to C-terminus.
At line 476:
p27KIP1 then proceeds to disengage the edge ß2-strand from the CDK2 N-terminal
lobe and occupy the ATP binding site,
2.16 p17 line 407: status, not statues
Corrected.
2.17 p18 line: 429 dephosphorylate, not dephosphorylated
Corrected.
2.18 p20 lines 488-490: these two first sentences seem to contradict each other?
We would like to apologise for the confusion here. Many cell cycle regulators are
degraded by SCF complexes following SCF Fbox protein recognition of a
phosphomotif (Eg p27KIP1 and cyclin E). However, in the case of cyclin D,
phosphorylation signals intracellular relocation to the cytoplasm. Structural studies
have recently shown that it is not the cyclin D phosphoepitope that is then
subsequently recognised by the SCF(FBX01) F box component but instead the
sequence at the C-terminus. So in summary, cyclin D phosphorylation is a pre-
requisite for cyclin D degradation (it needs to be in the cytoplasm) but the
phosphorylated residue is not part of a phosphodegron sequence that is recognised
by the E3 ubiquitin ligase. To clarify we have rewritten this part.
Starting at line 567:
Subsequent recognition of cyclin D1 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF FBXO31 is not
through direct binding of a phospho-T286-containing amino acid motif to FBXO31.
Instead, the structure of the Skp1-FBXO31-cyclin D1 phospho-peptide (residues 279-
295) complex revealed that essentially all the interactions between cyclin D1 and
FBX031 are made by the last four C-terminal cyclin D1 amino acids (292-295) and
not the sequence immediately around T286 (Figure 6f), [177]).
8
2.19 p24 lines 568-570: the analogy with tyrosine kinases as written does not hold.
The authors are appearing to argue that, in tyrosine kinases, substrate specificity
is achieved partially through spatial localisation. This is a different argument to
arguing that CDK4 and CDK6 may have scaffolding functions in their non-cell cycle
roles. It is also unclear why we would expect the roles of CDK4/6 in the regulation
of inflammatory response genes to be independent of catalytic activity per se – is
there evidence for this, or does it follow from being a non-canonical substrate, or
from possible absence of cyclin D (but cyclin D alone does not activate CDK4)??
We apologise that our argument is not clear at this point. We were intending to
propose that in the same way that receptor tyrosine kinases are localised to the cell
membrane and signal through phosphorylation of substrates that are frequently co-
located, CDK4 and CDK6 might similarly be organised into large, chromatin bound
complexes where their small number of substrates it can be hypothesised, are
similarly co-located. We agree that there is no argument to link tyrosine kinase
substrate specificity and CDK4 and CDK6 scaffolding functions. The ability of CDK6
to recruit transcriptional regulators and influence gene expression has been
reported to be “largely independent” of its kinase function (see PMID: 26719217 for
a review), original papers are Kollmann et al. (PMID: 27505678) and Lim et al.,
(PMID: 15790678).
To address this confusion the text has been changed to:
Starting at line 659:
Some of these functions are reported to require CDK4 or CDK6 kinase activity, but
others apparently do not, suggesting that CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D may in certain
contexts act independently and scaffold or maintain the integrity of larger signalling
complexes. Whether CDK4 and CDK6 can be cyclin D-associated but not have kinase
activity remains to be determined [205, 206]. By analogy with receptor tyrosine
kinases, where downstream signalling is elicited by limited activity against a small
set of spatially optimised substrates, it can be hypothesized that CDK4 and/or CDK6
roles in regulating transcription might result in some cases from their incorporation
into large, chromatin-bound complexes at gene promoters where their substrates
are co-located.
2.20 p27 first two paragraphs – the reference to figure 10 would make more sense
as part of the discussion about the mutations in the next paragraph rather than in
the introductory paragraph. Please could the authors insert a sentence to make it
clear that there are no structures of CDK4 / p16INK4A and to link to the relevance
of the CDK6/p16INK4A structure in the figure.
9
We thank the Reviewer for these points and address them by:
Deleting the reference to Figure 10 (now Figure 11) which has now been inserted at
line 783 after discussion of the CDK4 mutants. Moving the Figure 11 citation to this
point in the text now links Figure 11 to a discussion of the CDK4/6 mutants.
Starting at line 783:
As the sequences of CDKs 4 and 6 are highly conserved within the N-terminal lobe, it
is anticipated that mutation of CDK4 R24 also abolishes p16INK4A association by
breaking these key interactions, although this hypothesis is yet to be confirmed by
determination of a CDK4-p16INK4A structure.
2.21 Figures
Figure 1: This figure appears to show the conserved kinase domain, together with
some flanking regions. However, it is not clear from either the text (p4 line 72) or
the figure legend whether the sequence alignment is for the kinase domain alone,
or for the full-length sequence (I read the main text to suggest that the sequences
in figure 1 illustrated the differing lengths of N and C termini which is not the
case). Other than marking a number of the structural motifs (but not the
activation loop Thr) on the sequence of CDK1 and 2 (is there a reason why they are
not marked on the sequence of the other CDKs?), and indicating sequence
conservation (which is not discussed in the main text – eg to what extent are the
conserved residues CDK-specific and to what extent are they conserved elsewhere
in the kinome?), I am not clear what this figure adds to the review. The structural
insert provides a useful indication of the labelling of the different helices / sheets,
but perhaps this information could be included in eg figure 2a (which otherwise
duplicates the mapping of motifs to structure).
We thank the Reviewer for their comments but would like to retain Figure 1. The
alignment was created using the full-length CDK sequences and this is now included
in a revised Figure 1 legend. We used motifs colours for CDK1 and CDK2 as these are
the most well resolved structures and characterise the conserved kinase fold.
Colouring all sequences we thought would be too busy. We show some sequences
for other kinases outside of the conserved fold because they are referred to in the
text. For example the C-terminal tail sequences in the transcriptional CDKs. Overall,
we think that Figure 1 provides a useful reference point to relate structures to
sequences across the CDK family and provides a greater depth of detail than is
provide by just the structural figures alone-particular with regard to relating
structural to sequence conservation. A comparison of sequence features between
CDKs and other kinases is outside the scope of this review. Finally we have located
the activation segment threonine above the CDK1 sequence (T161).
10
Figure 2: Please could N- and C- lobes be marked in panel a. Since Thr160 is
mentioned many times in the main text, marking this residue would also be
helpful. Panel b gets quite crowded (especially in the centre). Would putting some
distance / perspective in here help the eye to see the kinase fold? Please can the
authors include a figure legend for panel c (or indicate which part of the existing
legend is appropriate). Panel d is referred to in the main text, but not in the figure
or figure legend. Additionally, this legend is quite long – could the argument about
estimating mobility from electron density be made in the main text? Electron
density is not indicated in figure 2, so reference to it does not directly aid our
understanding of the structures presented.
In response to the Reviewer’s requests we have:
Added N-lobe and C-lobe labels to panel a
Identified the position of T160 in panel a
Removed the reference to panel d in the main text
Reworded the Figure legend to explain how the quality of the electron density map
dictates the confidence that can be assigned to a structure:
Starting at line 911:
“Mobility is indicated by the quality of the experimental electron density maps, so
that the derived structures can be traced with varying degrees of confidence.”
Added a reference to panel c
We have already added depth to Figure 2b to help interpretation of the Figure. We
appreciate that the Figure is busy but as it is placed adjacent to the monomeric
CDK2 fold in panel a we hope this makes interpretation possible.
Figure 3: It is quite hard to distinguish the two superposed structures in panel a
and b. Perhaps depth perspective and / or a different choice of colours would
help. Additionally, the specular reflections on the surface of the cyclins come
across as spots rather than aiding the interpretation of contours (this is the case in
eg figure 5 as well). In panel d, it is hard to distinguish the colours of CDK2-spy1
and pThr160 CDK2-cyclin A – would adjusting one of these to orange help? The
figure legend for panel a has a large amount of detailed text comparing active and
inactive conformations of CDK2 which would probably be better in the main text.
In response to the Reviewer’s requests we have:
11
Enhanced the contrast between the colours in panels a and b to help distinguish the
two alternative loop conformations
Adjusted the surface parameters to avoid the speckling of the cyclin surfaces
Adjusted the activation loop of CDK2 bound to Spy1 to orange in order to contrast
better
Adjusted the label colour of the CDC6 peptide to black
We have included a summary of the mechanism of CDK2 activation by cyclin A
binding in the Figure legend to avoid an overly long description of what is now a well
established structural mechanism in the main text. This mechanism has been
reviewed many times before, and though it can’t be omitted, we thought it could be
incorporated into the Figure legend so that the main text would move more swiftly
to the more recent structures.
Figure 4: I presume that the activation loop is not resolved in many of the
structures (and hence not highlighted in panels b, c, e-h). If this is the case, please
could the authors mention this in the figure legend – ‘activation loop shown in red
where resolved in the structure’ would be sufficient. In panel b, it would help to
colour the LXCXE motif to indicate its location (similarly to the RXL motif).
The Reviewer is correct to point out that the activation loop is not resolved in a
number of structures. To clarify this point we have as suggested included the
phrase ‘The activation segment sequences are shown in red where resolved in the
structures’ in the Figure 4 Legend.
At line 976:
surface (residues 54-61) and partially resolved LXCXE motif shown in cyan(residues
6-9).
At line 983:
The activation segment sequences are shown in red where resolved in the structures.
Figure 6: Orange is used for the side chains of cyclin A and the ‘CDC6 peptide’ text.
Presumably the text should be yellow to match the peptide chain?
This is indeed the case. For consistency we have changed the text to yellow and
repositioned to improve clarity.
Figure 7: I find some of the text on this figure confusing. Eg ‘Tat C-terminal’ is
labelled twice in panel a (one at each end of the peptide) and similarly ‘AFF4 C-
12
terminal’ is labelled twice in panel b (right). Are these labels indicating the C-
terminus (terminus not terminal) and is one of them redundant? Similarly should
‘cyclin T C-terminal’ in panel b (left) be C-terminus?
Our apologies, one of the C-terminus labels should read N-terminus in each case.
We have also changed terminal to terminus.
Figure 8: panel a has no legend. It is also very hard to see the 3D arrangement of
the helices as drawn. In panel b, the label should presumably read LXCXE motif.
We have updated the Legend (now Figure 9) to include descriptions of panels a and
b:
Starting at line 1013:
(a) Sequences conservation between the cyclin D isoforms has been mapped onto
the structure of CDK4-cyclin D1 (PDB 2W96) and is represented by blue-scale
colouring. (b)
Our apologies, the label for LXCXE was written as LXEXC and has now been
corrected
The darker blue hue on the secondary structure has now been lightened. Similarly
the cyclin surface transparency has been increased to enable the helices to be
viewed more clearly.
Figure 11: three panels are referred to in the text, but only two are shown in the
figure (the MED12 complex is not illustrated). Panel a shows the TFIIH structure
(including Mat1 to which CDK7-cyclinH binds), but does not show either the CDK
nor the cyclin, nor discuss where / how they may interact with Mat1 (through
which partner? on which face?). While an interesting structure of transcription
factors, I am therefore not sure what this panel adds to the discussion on CDK-
cyclin interactions.
On reflection we now only include the CDK4-Cdc37-Hsp90 complex structure in this
figure.
Reviewer 3
3.1 CDK5 and CDK19 are the two members not included in the first summary
paragraph of the introduction. It is reasonable to omit them here if it helps clarity,
13
but perhaps they would fit easily in the “Other” (line 37) and “transcription” (line
33) classes?
This point was also brought up by Reviewer 2 and has been addressed in our
response to 2.3 above.
3.2 Line 89 describes N-terminal extensions in CDK16 and the PCTAIRE group of
kinases. Nowhere in the review is a description of the very large N and C-terminal
extensions in CDK12/13. While these do not regulate cyclin assembly they do
regulate function (RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation) and are therefore worthy of
inclusion here or perhaps in the subsequent transcription section.
To provide a focus for the review we have considered primarily those CDK
sequences for which we have structural information. The N- and C-terminal
extensions though functionally important are predicted to be unstructured. To
address this comment we have added the following text:
Starting at line 315:
A characteristic of CDKs 12 and 13 is the presence of much longer sequences N- and
C-terminal to the conserved catalytic fold than is found in other transcriptional CDKs
(Figure 1). These sequences are as yet not structurally characterised but do contain
a number of arginine/serine-rich and proline-rich motifs (amongst others) and
regulate CTD phosphorylation [93].
3.3 In this section line 159 illustrates a nice point about differences between CDK1
(essential gene) vs CDK2. This theme is continued in section 3 e.g. lines 330-332
discussing substrate preference differences. Do the differences here explain why
CDK2 cannot substitute for CDK1?
We thank the Reviewer for this comment. It is a question that we have thought a
lot about, but have concluded that the available structures can only suggest and
support possible models for why this is the case and not a definitive answer. In
summary certainly the smaller interface between CDK1 and cyclin B versus that
observed between CDK2 and its cognate cyclins, taken together with the amino acid
identities that form the cyclin CDK binding site can explain the ability of CDK1 and
CDK2 to discriminate between cyclins and to suggest that CDK1 could have the
malleability to bind to non-cognate cyclins and so promote cell cycle progression in
the absence of other CDKs. These thoughts are summarised as follows:
Starting at line 402:
14
“The structure of CDK1 suggests a mechanism by which activation loop flexibility,
embedded in an inherently, more flexible CDK1 fold allows CDK1 to accommodate a
more diverse substrate set than its nearest relative CDK2. These plastic properties
may also contribute to its ability to partner non-cognate cyclins in the absence of
other CDKs to drive the cell cycle [33, 118].”
3.4 Line 217 describes success licensing of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Investigational drugs
(e.g. phase I/II stage) can also be out-licensing from one biotech to another.
Perhaps the authors could write explicitly these are approved drug rather than the
term “licensing”?
We thank the Reviewer for this comment and have changed the text to now read:
Starting at line 245:
The conserved nature of the CDK4/6 active sites and their ability to adopt similar
structures is exemplified by the successful recent registration for clinical use of
highly selective ATP-competitive CDK4/6 inhibitors [68].
3.5 Line 233 perhaps “N-CBF” needs definition at first use. CBF was defined
previously, but perhaps N-terminal is help for students etc?
We thank the Reviewer for noticing this omission and have defined both N-terminal
and C-terminal cyclin box folds (N-CBF and C-CBF) at first use.
3.6 The RXL motif is referred to 3-4 times before line 353 where the first proper
description is given that it is a recruitment motif binding to the cyclin. Perhaps a
clearer sentence on this can be given earlier?
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have now included a description of
the RXL motif at this earlier point in the text:
Starting at line 388:
Apart from this motif, the only other significant sequence feature shared by many
cell cycle CDK substrates is the RXL motif, first identified by comparative sequence
analysis of multiple CDK substrates and inhibitors [113]. This sequence binds to a
site on the cyclin N-CBF that is conserved between cyclins A, B, D and E, and was first
structurally characterised following the determination of the structure of a CDK2-
cyclin A-p27KIP1 complex (PDB 1JSU, [114]).

3.7 Section 6 on cryo-EM of higher order complexes is a good addition compared
to older reviews in this subject area.
3.8 Fig 1 legend. Is it worth stating somewhere that CDK11A and CDK11B are gene
duplications that are therefore almost identical?
We have now noted this point by adding the following text to the Figure 1 legend:
At line 901:
CDK11A and CDK11B result from a gene duplication and are almost identical
(97.5%).
3.9 Fig 2 the Glycine-rich loop text color is not a good match to the structure.
As pointed out by the Reviewer, we have now changed the text color to match the
color used in the structure.
3.10 Fig 4 panel G. Better to show 4NST or 4CXA containing longer C-term
extension to match CDK13.
We thank the Reviewer for suggesting these alternative structures. We have now
(in response to another comment) included a new Figure (Figure 5) which illustrates
the CDK8, 9 and 12 C-terminal tail sequences in greater detail.
3.11 Fig 10 legend. Are all residues displayed cancer mutation sites? The legend is
a little vague. Do all block p16 binding?
The mutations were all selected from cancer genome databases (cbioportal,
COSMIC and tumour portal) and are therefore mutations found in clinical samples.
This point is now clarified in a revised Figure Legend (now Figure 11). The mutant
CDK6 proteins have not all been characterised for p16 binding. Though a number of
mutations are not in residues that directly contact p16, given the allosteric response
of CDK6 to INK binding we would not want to predict whether the mutations
indirectly affect CDK6-INK affinity.
At line 1036:
CDK6 mutations are selected from those described in cancer genome repositories
(see text for further details).

3.12 Fig. 11 maybe label CDK4 C-lobe and add arrow to mark point where
unfolded N-lobe emerges?
We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion and have modified the Figure with these
additions.
