Comments for the Authors
This is a very well written, easy to follow review discussing the critical roles of IL-17 in antiviral
immune responses and virus-induced illnesses. The authors provide the appropriate amount of
background and have done a nice job of pointing out the necessity of IL-17-involved therapeutic
strategies, which are uniquely tailored to both the infectious agent and the infection context. The
figures are nicely drawn and help to illustrate understudied areas. While the review is very clear
and fairly comprehensive, there are a few suggestions that the authors may wish to consider to
even further strengthen the review.
1. In a number of places, statements are made that are not supported by references. It would be
helpful for those readers not in the field to include references for these statements. Specific
examples include but are not limited to: in section 1.2(Peng et al.) can also be cited in ‘Enhancing
the survival of virus-infected cells’ section to illustrate IL - 17 is able to enhance the survival of
the virus infected cells, but it does not mean that this kind of surviving virus-infected cell would
promote viral infections and mediates viral infection-induced pathology.
2. The author put forward two different arguments in the form of questions in the title, but there
are only vague notions in the conclusion. They don’t answer the questions that raised at the
beginning of the paper. Perhaps the authors should make it clearly by using ‘In the case…, IL-17
plays a positive role in antiviral immune responses, while in the case…, IL-17 can promote and
exacerbate virus-induced illnesses.’ What challenges might need to be considered and/or
overcome? Some discussion on these points would help to synthesize the data presented in the
review and distill it down to a take home message for the readers.
3. There are many grammatical errors throughout the manuscript: no “the” before some nouns
which followed by “of”, such as “influenza infection of neonatal mice”, “activation of the IL-17-
secreting cells…”; “Further investigation revealed a loss of IL-17-producing cells due to depletion
of CD103+ DCs, which have been shown to both express genes favorable to IL-17 production and
induce the differentiation of IL-17A- and RORc-expressing cells upon coculture with naive T cells
in vitro”; “During murine systemic infection by HSV, Stout-Delgado et al. found that the
increased morbidity and mortality of aged mice was caused by a rapid increase in IL-17 level
(primarily produced by hepatic NKT cells) during infection”

Appendix A
Response to referees:
We would like to thank the editorial office and the referee for their
comprehensive assessment of our manuscript. We have taken all the
comments into account, in a manner that is described in detail below. The
contents that have been revised were marked bold and underlined in the main
manuscript. We think that, following the insightful suggestions of the editorial
office and the reviewer, our manuscript has gained in clarity and hope that the
changes made will be considered satisfactory.
Referee: 1
This is a very well written, easy to follow review discussing the critical roles of
IL-17 in antiviral immune responses and virus-induced illnesses. The authors
provide the appropriate amount of background and have done a nice job of
pointing out the necessity of IL-17-involved therapeutic strategies, which are
uniquely tailored to both the infectious agent and the infection context. The
figures are nicely drawn and help to illustrate understudied areas. While the
review is very clear and fairly comprehensive, there are a few suggestions that
the authors may wish to consider to even further strengthen the review.
1. In a number of places, statements are made that are not supported by
references. It would be helpful for those readers not in the field to include
references for these statements. Specific examples include but are not limited
to: in section 1.2(Peng et al.) can also be cited in ‘Enhancing the survival of
virus-infected cells’ section to illustrate IL-17 is able to enhance the survival of
the virus infected cells, but it does not mean that this kind of surviving
virus-infected cell would promote viral infections and mediates viral
infection-induced pathology.
Response: Thank you for your kind advice. We have revised the manuscript to
avoid such misunderstandings. To be specific, we have revised the sentence
“Inducing neutrophil migration and activation” as “Inducing excessive
neutrophil migration and activation” at line 392 to indicate a pathogenic role of
IL-17, because IL-17-induced neutrophil migration at a moderate level
participates in protective antiviral immune responses as discussed at lines
208-213. In addition, we have moved the content discussing the finding by
Peng et al. into section 2.1 (Enhancing the survival of virus-infected cells). By
doing so, this finding can be served as a special example showing the
promotion of virus permissive cells by IL-17 does not always promote viral
infections, so as to avoid the misunderstanding you worried. Please see the
new manuscript at lines 353-361.
2. The author put forward two different arguments in the form of questions in
the title, but there are only vague notions in the conclusion. They don’t answer
the questions that raised at the beginning of the paper. Perhaps the authors
should make it clearly by using ‘In the case…, IL-17 plays a positive role in
antiviral immune responses, while in the case…, IL-17 can promote and
exacerbate virus-induced illnesses.’ What challenges might need to be
considered and/or overcome? Some discussion on these points would help to
synthesize the data presented in the review and distill it down to a take home
message for the readers.
Response: Thanks for your insightful suggestion. We have answered the
questions that raised at the beginning of the paper and discussed what
challenges might need to be considered and/or overcome. Please see the new
manuscript at lines 713-724.
3. There are many grammatical errors throughout the manuscript: no “the”
before some nouns which followed by “of”, such as “influenza infection of
neonatal mice”, “activation of the IL-17-secreting cells…”; “Further
investigation revealed a loss of IL-17-producing cells due to depletion of
CD103+ DCs, which have been shown to both express genes favorable to
IL-17 production and induce the differentiation of IL-17A- and
RORc-expressing cells upon coculture with naive T cells in vitro”; “During
murine systemic infection by HSV, Stout-Delgado et al. found that the
increased morbidity and mortality of aged mice was caused by a rapid
increase in IL-17 level (primarily produced by hepatic NKT cells) during
infection”
Response: Thank you very much for your comment and we are sorry for our
mistakes. We have critically revised the manuscript. Please see the relevant
revisions throughout the new manuscript.
