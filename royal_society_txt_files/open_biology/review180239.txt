Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The review showed different aspects of posttranslational modifications in hnRNPK protein and
described their impact in hnRNPK function. I have some comments:
1- the abstract could indicate the alterations associated to the modifications described in hnRNPK
in the present manuscript more than describe hnRNPK protein itself;
2- In my opinion the "1.Introduction" should be excluded and other general informations in all
manuscript too.
3- In lines 94-96, the authors did a statement based on their review "a clear idea of the molecular
mechanism of how hnRNPK participating in abundant biological process". However, I suggest to
modify it. What is the motivation to write the revision and what the authors can conclude after
that? What are the questions unknown in PTM for hnRNPK? Do you think that PTM is the most
important mechanism to control hnRNP K function?
Minor points:
1- The authors should correct typos and English.
2- Fig.1- check the last effect listed in the figure (right side) "banding RNA", it´s correct?
3-Fig.2- What is the hnRNPk isoform used to perform the aligment? Include the access number.

Dear Dr Xu,
We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript RSOB-18-0239 entitled "Post-translational
modification control of RNA-binding protein hnRNPK function" has been accepted by the Editor
for publication in Open Biology. The reviewer has recommended publication, but also suggest
some minor revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, we invite you to respond to the reviewer's
comments and revise your manuscript.
Please submit the revised version of your manuscript within 14 days. If you do not think you will
be able to meet this date please let us know immediately and we can extend this deadline for you.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsob and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
3
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript.
Instead, please revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referee(s) and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use
this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referee.
Please see our detailed instructions for revision requirements
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/.
Before uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (doc, txt, rtf or tex), including the references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Please remove any tracked changes from the text before
submission. PDF files are not an accepted format for the "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (tiff, EPS or print-quality PDF preferred). The format
should be produced directly from original creation package, or original software format. Please
note that PowerPoint files are not accepted.
3) Electronic supplementary material: this should be contained in a separate file from the main
text and meet our ESM criteria (see http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-
authors#question5). All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be
treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website
and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available
approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can
be attributed a unique DOI.
Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during
submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will
not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that
the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI).
Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rsob.2016[last 4 digits of e.g. 10.1098/rsob.20160049].
4) A media summary: a short non-technical summary (up to 100 words) of the key
findings/importance of your manuscript. Please try to write in simple English, avoid jargon,
explain the importance of the topic, outline the main implications and describe why this topic is
newsworthy.
Images
We require suitable relevant images to appear alongside published articles. Do you have an
image we could use? Images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, if possible.
Data-Sharing
It is a condition of publication that data supporting your paper are made available. Data should
be made available either in the electronic supplementary material or through an appropriate
repository. Details of how to access data should be included in your paper. Please see
http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/authors/policy.xhtml#question6 for more details.

Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Open Biology, we look forward to
receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
