This is a very interesting paper that describes a novel nuclear function of the Mad1 checkpoint
protein. Mad1 is well known for its role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Its ability to
regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is also described in yeast and it has been shown to bind
nucleoporin TPR in human cells. This is likely to be a conserved new function because the present
paper now shows Mad1 to complex with TPR, Ulp1 and Rab2 (MINT complexes) in Drosophila.
This is based upon pull-down of a Mad1-GFP fusion followed by mass spec and co-dependent
colocalization of the proteins. Removal of the SAC component Mad2 has a limited effect on the
MINT complex. The authors ask whether Mad1 can influence chromatin organization using
previous published Mad1 null mutants and show recessive enhancement of position effect
variegation and polycomb gene repression. The findings indicate that removal of Mad1 leads to a
more compact, repressed chromatin structure. The experiments have been carefully executed;
they are well controlled; and clearly described.
These are very exciting findings that suggest Mad1 has a second role in regulating the
heterochromatization of chromatin. They lay the foundation for the future analysis of this new
complex at a molecular level. In the current stage of analysis, the authors use classical Drosophila
approaches that predict particular effects upon gene expression and demonstrate that the
proteins Mtor, Ulp1 and Raf2 depend on Mad1 for their proper behaviour in spermatocytes. This
adds weight to previous findings of Vaquerizas and colleagues that Mtor/Tpr associate with
transcriptionally active regions of chromatin in flies. It is to be fully expected that future studies
will demonstrate effects upon gene expression and it is appropriate to publish the present
findings to open the way to this future work. I strongly support publication of the paper in Open
Biology in its present form.
