The review article by Dulloo et al reviews the current knowledge of the molecular, cellular and
pathophysiological role of iRhom pseudoproteases. The group of Prof. Freeman has been
instrumental in uncovering the various activities of iRhom proteins and the authors did a
magnificent job in summarizing these findings of the past 20 years. iRhoms are crucially needed
for the trafficking and activation of the important ADAM17 protease, which governs at least three
important pathways, namely the TNFa, IL-6 and EGF-R signaling pathways. These pathways are
involved in the regulation of inflammation, infection, metabolism and cancer. In addition, there
are additional clients of iRhoms, which are not very well studied yet, and which will possible
change the direction of the field considerably. All important aspects of iRhom biology are nicely
covered in the review.
The review article is very well written and it will appear timely since more and more aspects of
inflammation and cancer research seem to involve iRhom activities.
There are some points, the authors might want to consider.
1. In the abstract, the authors write that the function of ADAM17 is shedding of cytokines and
growth factors. ADAM17 is also an important sheddase of many receptors and adhesion proteins.
This could be mentioned here.
2. On p3, the authors describe the different phenotypes of iRhom1 knock-out mice. Do the
authors have a possible explanation for the observed variation on phenotypes?
3. On p5, the authors describe the role on iRhom2 in the trafficking of ADAM17 from the ER to
the Golgi, where ADAM17 is processed by furin proteases. In contrast to the statement of the
authors, this furin cleavage does not lead to activation of ADAM17. This statement should be
rephrased.
4. On p12, the authors describe the transcriptional activation of iRhoms. They might want to
include a short statement on the structure of the promoters of the iRhom genes, which might
illustrate which pathways are likely to affect transcription of iRhom genes.
5. Some references (20, 21, 33, 39, 65, 67, 70) are imcomplete and should be amended.
6. In the inset of Fig. 1, the authors might want to indicate the iRhom homology domain (IRHD).
7. As far as this reviewer understands, the data summarized in Fig. 5 are not from Cavadas et al
but rather from Oikonomidi et al. This should be corrected.

Comments to the Author

The iRhom pseudoproteases are emerging as important regulators of the metalloprotease
ADAM17, which has a critical role in the body’s first line of defence against infection (via
shedding of TNFalpha) and repair (via shedding of EGF receptor ligands). This exciting story has
developed over the last six years through a number of high-impact publications, and this is in
part down to the work of the authors of this review, who have played a major role in initiating
this field. Their well-written and timely review provides an introduction to iRhoms and related
proteins, describes their role in protein turnover and trafficking of client proteins (including
ADAM17 and others), mechanisms of iRhom function, roles in disease, and a thoughtful
conclusion that nicely emphasises the current knowledge gaps and areas of future research
priority. The five figures and two tables are helpful inclusions.
My specific comments are as follows.
1. The current lack of clarity concerning the phenotype of iRhom1 knockout mice is mentioned a
couple of times in the review. It would be useful if the authors could comment on why they
think that the two publications on this show different phenotypes, particularly as they are
responsible for one of the papers.
2. It would be useful if an extra sentence or two could be added to explain the mechanisms of
action of the two iRhom client proteins STING and VISA. At present, their introductions are
somewhat vague.
4
3. On a couple of occasions, the relative conservation between regions of iRhom1 and 2 are
described, but using rather vague terms such as “least conserved” and “most highly conserved”.
It would be useful if the authors could add the precise percentage amino acid identities of the
different regions shown on Figure 4, by comparing the human iRhom1 and 2 sequences.
4. In Table 1, it would avoid confusion if “TACE” was changed to “ADAM17”, because the latter
is used in the main text.
5. In Table 2, the arthritis reference 14 should be changed to 62. Also, as a minor point, the breast
cancer and neurological disease rows do not really need “(i)”, because there is only one
phenotype listed.

Appendix A
Dulloo et al. Response to Referees
Referee: 1
1. In the abstract, the authors write that the function of ADAM17 is shedding
of cytokines and growth factors. ADAM17 is also an important sheddase of
many receptors and adhesion proteins. This could be mentioned here.
- It is true that ADAM17 has multiple other roles but in the context of iRhom
regulation, it is only cytokines and growth factors that have been reported. It
therefore feels appropriate in the abstract of this review to retain that focus.
2. On p3, the authors describe the different phenotypes of iRhom1 knock-out
mice. Do the authors have a possible explanation for the observed variation
on phenotypes?
- We believe the differences could be due to the way the genetic deletion of
iRhom1 was done in each mice. In Christova et al., exons 2-18 of iRhom1
were deleted, encompassing the whole coding sequence of the gene. In Li et
al., only exons 4-11 were removed, which does not exclude the possibility of
a shorter form of iRhom1 still being expressed. Several shorter transcripts of
iRhom1 have been described on UCSD genome browser to exist due to
alternative splicing events as highlighted in the text on Page 12. Also, the
different in genetic background of the mice used can also be a contributing
factor. A statement has been included in the text.
3. On p5, the authors describe the role on iRhom2 in the trafficking of
ADAM17 from the ER to the Golgi, where ADAM17 is processed by furin
proteases. In contrast to the statement of the authors, this furin cleavage
does not lead to activation of ADAM17. This statement should be rephrased.
- Statement has been modified accordingly.
4. On p12, the authors describe the transcriptional activation of iRhoms. They
might want to include a short statement on the structure of the promoters of
the iRhom genes, which might illustrate which pathways are likely to affect
transcription of iRhom genes.
- A brief description has been made accordingly.
5. Some references (20, 21, 33, 39, 65, 67, 70) are incomplete and should be
amended.
-Amendments made accordingly
6. In the inset of Fig. 1, the authors might want to indicate the iRhom
homology domain (IRHD).
- Label added accordingly
7. As far as this reviewer understands, the data summarized in Fig. 5 are not
from Cavadas et al but rather from Oikonomidi et al. This should be
corrected.
- Actually, we are right! The data summarised is taken from Cavadas et al.,
(main figures and the supplementary figures of the paper which details the
indicated interactors of iRhom2).
Referee: 2
1. The current lack of clarity concerning the phenotype of iRhom1 knockout

2. It would be useful if an extra sentence or two could be added to explain the
mechanisms of action of the two iRhom client proteins STING and VISA. At
present, their introductions are somewhat vague.
- Further statements about the role of STING and VISA have been included in
the text
3. On a couple of occasions, the relative conservation between regions of
iRhom1 and 2 are described but using rather vague terms such as “least
conserved” and “most highly conserved”. It would be useful if the authors
could add the precise percentage amino acid identities of the different
regions shown on Figure 4, by comparing the human iRhom1 and 2
sequences.
- Statements about percentage conservancy of amino acids for indicated
domains between iR1 and iR2 have been included in text.
4. In Table 1, it would avoid confusion if “TACE” was changed to “ADAM17”,
because the latter is used in the main text.
- TACE has been changed to ADAM17 accordingly
5. In Table 2, the arthritis reference 14 should be changed to 62. Also, as a
minor point, the breast cancer and neurological disease rows do not really
need “(i)”, because there is only one phenotype listed.
- Changes have been made accordingly.
