This review article assesses current mouse models of ID and Autism by a junior investigator who
has made contributions to the field. Overall the topic is of interest to a broad swath of
neuroscientists interested in autism and synaptic mechanisms. However the manuscript needs
significant editing to make it easily digestible and informative to both those in and outside of the
discipline. Minor concerns are about some of the grammatical issues and awkward sentence
structure which would benefit from some editorial input. But more importantly the manuscript is
too diffuse without a central unifying concept. It is not clear whether the authors wish to find
some convergence across the models they discuss and in fact it remains unclear why these are the
focus of the article. The authors need to articulate a critical central theme and discuss the relevant
models to highlight these.
Moreover the current version reads like a laundry list of every study done in these mouse models
and does not critically assess or summarize key findings. This makes the manuscript a little
tedious to follow and does not put forward a more thoughtful discussion of the current state of
the field. For instance many behavioral tests carried out in the Fmr1 ko mice are listed and then it
is stated that other studies cannot replicate these. The reader is left wondering what is the
important finding in these mice. Some further assessment and conclusions are warranted in each
case. This would also allow the authors to reduce the length of the manuscript which is currently
overly lengthy.
The authors should also carefully consider what they want to discuss in the introduction. There is
a lengthy discussion of critical periods and then this is not mentioned later in the context of mice.
The thematic goals need to be more strongly tied together so that the reader can follow the line of
thought and what are the important findings and outstanding gaps when trying to relate mouse
studies to the human phenotype. For instance a discussion of critical periods and learning and
memory don't really make much sense here.
Overall a major revision is required to improve this manuscript for publication.

The review “Understanding Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder from common
mouse models: synapses to behaviour” by Verma et. al. highlighted recent advancement,
upcoming challenges and pressing questions in the field. The review provided through and
adequate information related to current understanding of ID and ASD. I strongly believe that the
review will attract necessary attention in the field. However, the review need a major revision
related to presentation of existing knowledge, English language and figures. The mauscript is
good fit for publication in Open Biology with revision. My concerns are as follows:
1) The review needs to be threaded together for better appreciation of current knowledge in the
field. Authors need to connect physiological relevance (electrophysiology data, spine defects and
behavioural deficits) of the data with mechanistic details. In current version, these are presented
in isolation.
2) Metaplasticity and contribution of glial cells in ID and ASD should be presented along with the
section describing ID or ASD.
3) Conclusion section should highlight specific challenges, technical limitations and pressing
questions in each of this field. It should provide information about future direction of research in
each of these disorders.
4) I noticed authors often used colloquial terminology all throughout the manuscript. Few
example – line # 46, 47, 55 in Page 2, line # 114 in Page 4, line #121 in Page 5, line 248 in page # 9,
Page # 5 line 128 ..
5) Authors should specify specific brain area / cell type where differential expression is reported.
Please see line # 55 in Page # 2 “differences in the tissue levellocalisation..” which tissue? Line #
58, page # 3 “SYNGAP1 is localized to the brain areas” which brain area?
4
6) Authors should mention how astrocyte maturation influence excitatory synapse development
and why this process is linked to ID.
7) Following statements is very confusing and I am not able to clearly understand what authors
wants to state:
a) Page # 3 line# 62 – 64. Does environmental factors regulate genetic factors contributing to
ID/ASD? If so, example supported by literature.
b) Page #4 line 88 – 89. What is metanalysis? There is no connection with statements mentioned in
the paragraph.
c) It seems to me line # 91 – 99 and line #105 – 111 on the same page is out of place and needs to
be restated.
d) Line # 120 – 123 in Page # 5 and line #170 – 173 in Page # 6 are very confusing and complex
sentences.
e) Authors should mention visual cortex area V1 instead of just V1 for easy understanding of
readers outside the field.
f) Line # 194 – 197 in page # 7, line # 289 – 290 Page # 10, line # 460 – 462 in Page # 16, line # 505 –
507 in Page # 17, line # 761 – 763 Page # 26 and there are similar example of confusing
statements.
8) There are some over simplified statements. For example - “Therefore, as an adult..” line # 156
in Page 6.
9) Line # 210, page 8 “GABA to open critical” – Does GABA act as switch for opening / closing of
critical period of plasticity or it is important for extending critical period of plasticity.
10) Authors should describe common strategies to make animal models, shortcoming and
advantages of each of these models.
11) Does SYNGAP regulate mGluR LTD that is independent of FMRP-mediated protein
synthesis? If so, why Syngap1 mRNA is associated with FMRP?
12) SYNGAP regulates spine morphology. Although, there is a mention of SYNGAP-mediated
control cytoskeleton rearrangements in Figure but it is not well described in the text.
13) What are these contradictory evidences mentioned in line # 465 in Page 16?
14) What is I/O ratio?
15) It is not clear what is the link between mIPSC and mGluR LTD, see line # 810 – 811 , page 27.

Appendix A
Dear Editor and Reviewer's,
We thank both the reviewers for their critical comments and suggestions and for a thorough review
of the manuscript. We have taken all the suggestions and comments into consideration, and all the
authors' have worked on these comments and suggestions to incorporate it in the revised
manuscript. We have requested our native English speaker friends to check for grammar or spelling
errors. We have also used Grammarly software to check for spelling errors, appropriate sentence
formation, and for grammatical errors.
Response to Reviewer's:
Referee#1
<U+F0B7> This review article assesses current mouse models of ID and Autism by a junior
investigator who has made contributions to the field. Overall the topic is of interest to a
broad swath of neuroscientists interested in autism and synaptic mechanisms. However the
manuscript needs significant editing to make it easily digestible and informative to both
those in and outside of the discipline.
We thank the reviewer for the all comments to improve the content of the review. As per the
suggestions of the reviewer, we have made considerable changes in the manuscript to improve
clarity for both neuroscience as well as non-neuroscience readers. We wanted to discuss different
aspects such as molecular, biochemical, and neurophysiological of a mutation which makes this
review long but informative. When we wrote this view, we discussed with graduate students
regarding what informations are lacking when they read a given review, and we wanted to
incorporate those informations in order to bring all available informations to our readers, mainly
graduate students and post-docs, and non-neuroscientists.
<U+F0B7> Minor concerns are about some of the grammatical issues and awkward sentence structure
which would benefit from some editorial input.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We have performed a thorough check for grammatical
errors in the revised manuscript. Also, we had used Grammarly software to correct any
grammatical errors and make sentence structure appropriate.
<U+F0B7> But more importantly the manuscript is too diffuse without a central unifying concept. It is
not clear whether the authors wish to find some convergence across the models they discuss
and in fact it remains unclear why these are the focus of the article. The authors need to
articulate a critical central theme and discuss the relevant models to highlight these.
We thank the reviewer for the critical comments on the manuscript. Our idea at the time of writing
this review, as the title suggests, was to summarise the animal models, particularly mouse models,
available to study different monogenic mutations identified in patients with ASD/ID. However, it
is evident from studies that not all animal models manifest same degree of phenotype with respect
to a particular disease. Hence, it is really important to identify and elaborate on a central theme, as
the reviewer has suggested in the earlier comment. To clarify, we have introduced the critical
period of plasticity as one of the subsections within each gene mutations in the revised manuscript.
Recent studies from the works of the corresponding author and other labs has emphasised on the
fact that alteration in critical period of development is one of the major contributors to
pathophysiology in ASD/ID. Therefore, we believe that it is essential to highlight critical period
plasticity in the available disease models alongside with other aspects.
<U+F0B7> Moreover the current version reads like a laundry list of every study done in these mouse
models and does not critically assess or summarize key findings. This makes the
manuscript a little tedious to follow and does not put forward a more thoughtful discussion
of the current state of the field.
We are thankful to the reviewer for the critical comments on the manuscript. We apologise for not
highlighting the critical central theme in the previous version of the manuscript, even though we
have done a comprehensive literature review on almost all studies done so far. We agree, such
thorough literature review without a central theme is tough to follow. Hence, as per the suggestions
we have discussed the current state of the field with respect to different animal models available,
as well as potential future models could be implemented, in the Discussion section of the revised
review.
<U+F0B7> For instance many behavioral tests carried out in the Fmr1 ko mice are listed and then it is
stated that other studies cannot replicate these. The reader is left wondering what is the
important finding in these mice. Some further assessment and conclusions are warranted
in each case. This would also allow the authors to reduce the length of the manuscript
which is currently overly lengthy.
We thank the reviewer for the comments to improve our manuscript. We agree that a few mouse
models failed to show phenotypes similar to human patients, particularly in response to drug. As
we had discussed in the animal model section on the criteria to choose a good mouse model to
study a human disease/disorder, the animal model must fulfil the criteria. We wanted to emphasise
how certain models do not fulfil these criteria to our readers, and the importance of choosing a
good animal model. Therefore, our review could provide clarity on choosing a good animal model
amongst many available animal models.
<U+F0B7> The authors should also carefully consider what they want to discuss in the introduction.
There is a lengthy discussion of critical periods and then this is not mentioned later in the
context of mice.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We apologise for the lack of clarity in the manuscript.
As per the suggestion of the reviewer, we have incorporated the critical period of plasticity in the
context of each mouse model.
<U+F0B7> The thematic goals need to be more strongly tied together so that the reader can follow the
line of thought and what are the important findings and outstanding gaps when trying to
relate mouse studies to the human phenotype. For instance a discussion of critical periods
and learning and memory don't really make much sense here.
We thank the reviewer for the critical comments. We agree that discussion on critical period of
plasticity in introduction does not have an impact, unless critical period of plasticity for all the
mutations is available for readers. In the revised manuscript, we have added critical period of
plasticity for all mutations, as suggested by the reviewer.
We have also highlighted the gaps in the available mouse models in the Discussion section. In
addition, we have discussed the importance of using human derived iPSCs to study ID/ASD as
well as to identify drugs specific for a mutation, if possible.
<U+F0B7> Overall a major revision is required to improve this manuscript for publication.
We thank the reviewer for all the comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript. We have
incorporated all the changes as suggested by the reviewer.
Referee#2
<U+F0B7> The review “Understanding Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder from
common mouse models: synapses to behaviour” by Verma et. al. highlighted recent
advancement, upcoming challenges and pressing questions in the field. The review
provided through and adequate information related to current understanding of ID and
ASD.
We thank the reviewer for all the comments and suggestions.
<U+F0B7> I strongly believe that the review will attract necessary attention in the field. However, the
review need a major revision related to presentation of existing knowledge, English
language and figures. The mauscript is good fit for publication in Open Biology with
revision.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We have performed a thorough check for grammatical
and spelling errors and modified the language to a formal English in the revised manuscript. Also,
we had used Grammarly software to correct any grammatical errors and make sentence structure
appropriate.
<U+F0B7> My concerns are as follows:
1) The review needs to be threaded together for better appreciation of current knowledge in
the field. Authors need to connect physiological relevance (electrophysiology data, spine
defects and behavioural deficits) of the data with mechanistic details. In current version,
these are presented in isolation.
We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and comments on our manuscript. As the reviewer has
suggested, we have linked the data presented in the section of different mutations to its physiology
and behaviour in the revised manuscript. Thus, we believe it will bring clarity to the readers to
correlate electrophysiological, imaging and behaviour data. In addition, we have correlated
synaptic deficit data with behavioural phenotype which will further bring clarity to the readers.
2) Metaplasticity and contribution of glial cells in ID and ASD should be presented along
with the section describing ID or ASD.
We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The studies involving metaplasticity and glial cells in
ID/ASD are limited, particularly for different mutations. As of now, there is a lack of data available
for metaplasticity in the literature for any of the ID/ASD mentioned in the manuscript. Similar,
studies on the function of astrocytes in pathophysiology in ID/ASD is available only for Fragile X
syndrome and not for any other mutations mentioned in this manuscript. However, recently, a few
labs have started research on the function of astrocytes in ID/ASD, but those labs have only
preliminary evidences. Therefore, we have written this section separately, instead of writing it for
each mutation, so that the readers can understand the lack of information related to metaplasticity
and astrocytes in these mutations.
3) Conclusion section should highlight specific challenges, technical limitations and
pressing questions in each of this field. It should provide information about future direction of
research in each of these disorders.
We thank the reviewer for the crucial suggestions and comments on our manuscript. We have
incorporated all the suggestions in the revised manuscript.
4) I noticed authors often used colloquial terminology all throughout the manuscript. Few
example – line # 46, 47, 55 in Page 2, line # 114 in Page 4, line #121 in Page 5, line 248 in page #
9, Page # 5 line 128 .
We apologise for these errors. We thank you for the detailed comments. We have now made
appropriate corrections in the revised manuscript.
vious version: Line 46, 47 in Page 2; ‘symptoms which distinguishes patients with ID is their
bility to take care of themselves for normal day to day activities’
vised version: The colloquial sentence has been removed and the self-care aspect has been included
he line 43
vious version: Line 55 in page 2; ‘While the distribution of certain proteins like FMRP is
despread, the expression for other proteins like SYNGAP1 is localised to the brain areas,’
vised version: Line 53 in page 2; ‘While the distribution of certain proteins like FMRP is
despread, the SYNGAP1 protein is expressed only in the brain, not in any other organ.’
vious version: Line 114 in page 4; ‘However, they are classifiable based on the timing of causation
ncerning birth), the nature of the causal factor (genetic, environmental or unknown) or a
mbination of both.’
vised version: Line 118 in page 5; ‘The causes of ID and ASD are multifarious and involve a range
genetic to environmental factors.’
vious version: Line 121 in page 5; ‘Environmental input during this period plays an instrumental
e in shaping the development and function of the brain’
vised version: Line 123-128 in page 5; ‘Environmental stress factors like poor nutrition, hygiene,
ection, familial instability, and socio-economic causes, may affect brain development contributing
ID/ASD. For example, it is now believed that the oxidative stress as a result of environmental
ssors like heavy metals affects sulphur metabolism which leads to alteration of epigenetic
chanisms of gene expression. Hence, the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors
ys a crucial role in the pathology of ASD/ID’.
vious version: Line 128 in page 5; ‘Non- inherited or acquired genetic factors are a majorly studied
se of ID.’
vised version: The colloquial line has been removed
vious version: Line 228 in page 9; ‘However, it is not possible to mimic all aspects of a disorder
disease in any one animal model.’
vised version: Line 244-246 in page 9; ‘Although it is not possible to mimic all aspects of a disorder
disease in any one animal model, a good animal model should be able to replicate the clinical
lmarks of the disease with the paramount degree of robustness.’
5) Authors should specify specific brain area / cell type where differential expression is
reported. Please see line # 55 in Page # 2 “differences in the tissue levellocalisation..”
which tissue? Line # 58, page # 3 “SYNGAP1 is localized to the brain areas” which brain
area?
thank the reviewer for bringing this to our notice. For clarity, we have incorporated these
gestions.
vious version: Line 55-58; ‘Differences in the tissue level localisation of the proteins may also be
ponsible for the severity of symptoms associated with a mutation in the genes coding for these
teins. While the distribution of certain proteins like FMRP is widespread, the expression for other
teins like SYNGAP1 is localised to the brain areas, particularly in the excitatory postsynapses,’
vised version: Line 53-54; ‘While the distribution of certain proteins like FMRP is widespread, the
NGAP1 protein is expressed only in the brain, not in any other organ’
6) Authors should mention how astrocyte maturation influence excitatory synapse
development and why this process is linked to ID.
We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have briefly discussed how astrocyte maturation
influences excitatory synapse development in the revised manuscript. We have included that the
secretion of molecules such as glypicans by astrocytes which help in the conversion of silent to
functional synapses, thereby, facilitating the insertion of AMPA receptors. On this basis one can
speculate that any alteration in this process might alter the critical period of plasticity which in
turn might lead to ID/ASD, although, there is not direct evidence as of now.
Previous version: Line 77-78; ‘It has been observed that the timing of the astrocyte maturation
coincides well with the formation of the excitatory synapses in the brain.’
vised version: Line 74-77; ‘It has been observed that the timing of the astrocyte maturation
ncides well with the formation of the excitatory synapses in the brain. Secretion of molecules such
glypicans by astrocytes helps in the conversion of silent to functional synapses, thereby, facilitating
insertion of AMPA receptors.’
7) Following statements is very confusing and I am not able to clearly understand what authors
wants to state:
a) Page # 3 line# 62 – 64. Does environmental factors regulate genetic factors contributing to
ID/ASD? If so, example supported by literature.
thank the reviewer for the comments. We have incorporated these changes and discussed briefly
the environmental factors regulating genetic factors contributing to the ID/ASD.
vious version: Line 62 – 64: Amongst the environmental factors which can lead to ID and ASD
lude the use of certain drugs during pregnancy like valproate, alcohol, infections, exposure to
vy metals like lead and mercury, and malnutrition. However, many cases of ID are known to be
opathic
vised version: Line 58-62: ‘Amongst the environmental factors which can lead to ID and ASD
lude the use of certain drugs during pregnancy like valproate, alcohol, infections, exposure to
vy metals like lead and mercury, and malnutrition. Though a complex interplay of
ironmental and genetic factors is known to play a role in the pathophysiology of ID/ ASD, most
es are idiopathic.’
Additionally, we have incorporated the suggestions in the section, causes of intellectual
disability, line 125-128 ‘For example, it is now believed that the oxidative stress as a
result of environmental stressors like heavy metals affects sulphur metabolism which
leads to alteration of epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression. Hence, the complex
interplay of genetic and environmental factors plays a crucial role in the pathology of
ASD/ID.’
b) Page #4 line 88 – 89. What is metanalysis? There is no connection with statements
mentioned in the paragraph.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We have modified this statement to bring clarity to our
readers.
Previous version: Line 88-89; ‘Metanalysis studies have highlighted the procedural limitations and
underreporting of the cases from several parts of the world’.
Revised version: Line 90-92; ‘Metanalysis studies, which make use of the statistical procedures to
analyse data from already existing reports, have highlighted the procedural limitations and
underreporting of the cases from several parts of the world’.
c) It seems to me line # 91 – 99 and line #105 – 111 on the same page is out of place and
needs to be restated.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We apologise for these errors. We have edited these
sentences.
vious version: Line 90-99; ‘Additionally, the prevalence was higher in the low- and middle-
ome countries which could attribute to the lack of fundamental diagnostic and management
ources in these geographical locations. An exhaustive study done in children from birth till 12
rs of age had found that the prevalence of NDD is as high as 1 in 6 children in the United States
America. Moreover, in the same study, the incidence was higher amongst the males in comparison

NDDs, insights into new possible therapeutic targets and their mechanisms may aid to find
igation strategies in the future.’
vised version: Line 93-98; ‘However, current studies have shown the prevalence to be higher in
low- and middle-income countries which could attribute to the lack of fundamental diagnostic
management resources in these geographical locations. Considering NDDs requires early
gnosis, an exhaustive study done in children from birth till 12 years of age had found that the
valence to be as high as 1 in 6 children in the United States of America. Moreover, in the same

vised version: Line 109-116; ‘Although there are several unexplored mechanisms associated with
ASD, the involvement of synaptic function and plasticity in ID and ASD is well characterised.
th the advancement in technology to measure neuronal activity (electrophysiology and deep-brain
aging) and understanding of the mechanisms which modulates synaptic plasticity may aid in
ther expanding our knowledge to decipher the pathophysiology of ID and ASD. In this review, we
l discuss what are the implications of monogenic mutations on the physiological, molecular and
chemical, and morphological aspects of neuronal and neuronal development using different mouse
dels from the studies carried out in the past few decades.’
d) Line # 120 – 123 in Page # 5 and line #170 – 173 in Page # 6 are very confusing and
complex sentences.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We apologise for these errors. We have corrected these
errors in the revised manuscript.
vious version: Line 120-123 in Page #5; Environmental input during this period plays an
trumental role in shaping the development and function of the brain. Thus, stress factors of
ironmental origin such as poor nutrition, hygiene, infection, familial instability, most likely
ing socio-economic roots, can cause improper brain development leading to ID/ASD.’
vised version: Line 123-128 in Page #5; Environmental stress factors like poor nutrition, hygiene,
ection, familial instability, and socio-economic causes, may affect brain development contributing
ID/ASD. For example, it is now believed that the oxidative stress as a result of environmental
ssors like heavy metals affects sulphur metabolism which leads to alteration of epigenetic
chanisms of gene expression. Hence, the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors
ys a crucial role in the pathology of ASD/ID.
Previous version: line #170 – 173 in Page # 6; Similarly, onset of hearing triggers critical period
of development of auditory cortex in humans. In the recent decade or so, several labs have used
visual and thalamocortical regions of the brain as a model to understand the impact of occlusion
of sensory input impairs formation, maturation, and elimination of neuronal connections.
Revised version: line #166-170 in page #6; Similarly, the onset of hearing triggers critical period
of development of auditory cortex in humans. Perturbation in neuronal connections of these
regions before the end of the critical period might permanently compromise their function. In the
recent decade or so, several labs have used visual, auditory, and thalamocortical regions of the
brain as a model to understand the importance of critical period in plasticity and development of
an individual.
e) Authors should mention visual cortex area V1 instead of just V1 for easy understanding
of readers outside the field.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We have incorporated these changes
f) Line # 194 – 197 in page # 7, line # 289 – 290 Page # 10, line # 460 – 462 in Page # 16,
line # 505 – 507 in Page # 17, line # 761 – 763 Page # 26 and there are similar example of
confusing statements.
We thank the reviewer for the critical comments on our manuscript. We have rephrased the
sentences to bring more clarity.
vious version: Line 289-290 in page 10; ‘These mice showed a significant impairment in the
rking memory but performed comparably to the wild-type animals in the reference memory tasks’
vised version: Line 280-282 in page 10; ‘Syngap1+/- mice showed a significant decline in the
rking memory, though, the performance was comparable to the wild-type animals in the reference
mory tasks suggesting only certain memories are impaired.’
Previous version: Line 460-462 in page 16; ‘However, it cannot be conclusively said that the
Fmr1-KO mice model successfully recapitulates the human behavioural phenotypes of the fragile
x syndrome as multiple studies have reported contradictory evidence to all the tests mentioned
above’.
Revised version: Line 495-497 in page 17; ‘However, caution should be shown to determine a
suitable mouse model as it should fulfil the criteria discussed in the animal model section earlier’.
Previous version: Line 505-507; ‘In general, reduced inhibition and increased excitation levels
were observed in these mice, corroborative with the increased susceptibility to seizures, that might
result due to imbalanced levels of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory signalling in the
brain’.
Revised version: Line 536-537; ‘In general, reduced inhibition and increased excitation levels were
observed in these mice, corroborative with the increased susceptibility to seizures and
epileptogenesis’.
Previous version: Line # 194 – 197 in page # 7; For example, based on these studies, NMDARs
are considered as one of the molecular determinants of the critical period of plasticity as NMDAR-
mediated synaptic transmission are developmentally regulated and their expression could be
modified by neuronal activity [58, 59]. Depending on the expression of a subunit of NMDAR,
NR2A or NR2B, the current mediated from these subunits varies during developmental stages that
suggest closure of the critical period, thereby, signalling a change in the processing of information.
Revised version: Line # 190 – 193 in page # 7; For example, based on these studies, NMDARs are
considered as one of the molecular determinants of the critical period of plasticity as NMDAR-
mediated synaptic transmission are developmentally regulated, and their expression could be
modified by neuronal activity.
Previous version: line # 761 – 763 Page # 26; Since ID/ASD is one of the neurodevelopmental
disorders, understanding the role of these proteins in synaptic function during early stages of
development might give insights into the role of NLGNs in critical period of development
regulation via NLGNs. For studying the correlation of NLGNs on the critical period of
development, monocular and binocular deprivation (MD, BD) in mice was performed.
Revised version: Above sentences has been removed as they were discussed later in the section.
8) There are some over simplified statements. For example - “Therefore, as an adult..” line
# 156 in Page 6.
We thank the reviewer for the critical comments on our manuscript. We have rephrased the
sentences as suggested by the reviewer.
Previous version: 156 in Page 6; Therefore, as an adult, it is slightly difficult to learn new things
at faster pace than in childhood.
Revised version: 154-155 in Page 6; For example, a child may learn a new language in a few
months to a year, but, it might take years for an adult to learn the same language.
9) Line # 210, page 8 “GABA to open critical” – Does GABA act as switch for opening /
closing of critical period of plasticity or it is important for extending critical period of
plasticity.
We thank the reviewer for the critical comments on our manuscript. GABA functions via two Cl-
cotransporters, NKCC1 and KCC2 (whose expressions are developmentally regulated), present in
the brain. Switch-over of NKCC1 to KCC2 marks the end of the critical period of development
and plasticity. Therefore, indirectly, GABA serves as a switch for opening / closing of critical
period of plasticity. It could be used as an essential therapeutic target for extending the critical
period of plasticity in the neurodevelopmental disorders.
10) Authors should describe common strategies to make animal models, shortcoming and
advantages of each of these models.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. This is incorporated as per the reviewer's suggestions.
Revised version: Line 1071-1084; ‘Preclinical studies in this regard can warrant some useful clues
for the translational success of small molecules...........Such combinatorial study can fulfil the
existing gap in our knowledge about ID/ASD and show the way for future therapeutic strategies’.
11) Does SYNGAP regulate mGluR LTD that is independent of FMRP-mediated protein
synthesis? If so, why Syngap1 mRNA is associated with FMRP?
We thank the reviewer for the comments. In syngap1 heterozygous condition, mGluR-LTD was
shown to be increased (We have described it in the manuscript). However, the mechanism behind
the same is not known, in the context of Syngap1 heterozygous. Whereas, FMRP does regulate
Syngap1 mRNA translation by associating with it (accepted in Front. In Mol. Neuroscience). These
observations suggest that there could be a crosstalk between FMRP and SYNGAP1.
We apologise for the lack of clarity in the manuscript. We have rephrased those sentences to make
it clear to the readers.
Previous version: Line 373-375; ‘Our unpublished data and their results showed an increase in
LTD in the Syngap1+/- mice which were independent of the protein synthesis, but, the results were
similar to Fmr1-/- suggesting a possible regulation of Syngap1 mRNA by FMRP’.
Revised version: Line 375-382; ‘To study the role mGluR-mediated LTD, Barnes et al. stimulated
Group I mGluRs with Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in the hippocampus and showed mGluR-
LTD was significantly increased and independent of protein synthesis in Syngap1+/- mice at PND
25-32...... suggests a presence of convergence in the biochemical signalling pathway downstream
of mGluR- and NMDAR- mediated signalling proteins, although it needs to be explored’.
12) SYNGAP regulates spine morphology. Although, there is a mention of SYNGAP-
mediated control cytoskeleton rearrangements in Figure but it is not well described in the
text.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. As per the suggestion, we have incorporated
SYNGAP1’s role in cytoskeleton rearrangements in the revised version.
Revised version: Line 393-396; ‘Additionally, the activity of proteins like p21-Activated Kinase,
RAC, and p-Cofilin, which are regulated by the SYNGAP1, were also elevated in the SYNGAP1+/-
mice under the basal conditions. Thus, SYNGAP1 regulates spine morphology and function by
modulating cytoskeletal dynamics.’
13) What are these contradictory evidences mentioned in line # 465 in Page 16?
We thank the reviewer for the comments. As per the suggestion, we have reframed the sentence to
make it reader friendly and one unified viewpoint has been highlighted.
14) What is I/O ratio?
We thank the reviewer for the comments. I/O ratio is input/output ratio. It`s the measure of basal
synaptic transmission of the neurons which means there should be a corresponding output to every
input provided to the neurons.
15) It is not clear what is the link between mIPSC and mGluR LTD, see line # 810 – 811
, page 27.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. Patch clamp recordings from the cerebellum of Nlgn3
KO mice has revealed increased mIPSC (increased number of functional GABA receptors) and
decreased mEPSC (decreased number of functional AMPA receptors) in the cerebellum,
suggesting increased inhibitory activity as a number of functional GABAR are more as compared
to excitatory activity. Additionally, since there was decreased mEPSC (decreased number of
functional AMPA receptors in the postsynapse, and LTD, which is the correlate for endocytosis
of AMPAR from the postsynapse), it has been observed impairment of mGluR-mediated long-
term depression (LTD). We have incorporated revised these changes in the manuscript.
Previous version: line # 810 – 811 , page 27; Patch clamp recordings from the hippocampus,
somatosensory cortex, and cerebellum of Nlgn3 KO mice has revealed increased mIPSC and
decreased mEPSC in the hippocampus, and decreased mEPSC and impaired mGluR-mediated
long-term depression (LTD) in the cerebellum.
Revised version: line # 883 – 890 , page 30; Patch clamp recordings from the hippocampus,
somatosensory cortex, and cerebellum of Nlgn3 KO mice has revealed increased mIPSC (increased
number of functional GABA receptors) and decreased mEPSC (decreased number of functional
AMPA receptors) in the hippocampus, suggesting increased inhibitory activity as a number of
functional GABAR are more as compared to excitatory activity. Additionally, decreased mEPSC
and impaired mGluR-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in the cerebellum was also observed,
which suggests the differential function of Nlgn3 in different regions of the brain
