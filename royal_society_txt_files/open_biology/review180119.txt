Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The manuscript by Lamb and Hunt is a comprehensive analysis on the evolution of genes coding
for key proteins involved in calcium feedback regulation of vertebrate phototransduction. The
authors focus on four protein families: recoverin/visinin, GCAPs, guanylyl cyclases (GCs) and
the Na+/Ca2+, K+-exchangers. The analysis includes in particular aspects of gene duplication
and losses before and during rounds of whole-genome duplication. The manuscript is clearly
written and needs only some minor corrections or considerations addressing the following
points:
Lines 99-101: to my knowledge there are only two publications investigating binding of Mg2+ to
recoverin (Ozawa et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 14495-14503; Marino et al. (2015) BBA 1853, 2055-
2065). According to these publications Mg2+ partially binds to Ca2+-free recoverin keeping the
myristoyl group buried. Since the authors do not refer to these papers, I am not sure what they
actually mean. They might think of the situation in GCAPs, but binding of Mg2+ there appears
structurally different.
Line 141: binding of Mg2+ to EF2 and EF3 is sufficient to switch GCAPs into the activated state.
So far, disabling of Mg2+ to EF4 had no effect on GCAP function and it is unclear, whether
binding of Mg2+ to EF4 occurs.
Line 144: GCAP2 has a myristoyl group. It does not undergo a classical (recoverin-like) Ca2+-
myristoyl switch. Instead it differs from GCAP1 in other aspects:
- [Ca2+] range of operation
- kinetic parameters of target activation (catalytic efficiency)
- conformational changes, position and role of myristoyl group
Lines 150-151: while GCAP1 seems primarily target GC-E in vivo, I doubt that GCAP2 is
primarily targeting GC-F. In vitro activity measurements and the relative amounts of GCs in
mammalian rod preparations are arguments against this statement.
Lines 174-175: this reviewer appreciates the aim of the authors to avoid the confusion that has
been created in the field of sensory GC due to differences in gene names and protein names.
However, I am still confused:
According to Raetscho et al. (2009 and 2010) all zebrafish retinal GCs (gucy2f, gc2 and gc3) show
the highest sequence homology to human GC-F. In contrast, Stiebel-Kalish et al. (2012) use a
gucy2f knockdown as an animal model for Leber´s congenital amaurosis, which is caused by
mutations in human GUCY2D (GC-E). Finally, Collery and Kennedy correlate the zatoichi
mutant (zGC3) to GUCY2D. Can the authors clarify?
Line 214: a misprint, it should be 200-500 nM.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
This paper is a thorough, comprehensive investigation of the evolution of genes involved in the
calcium feedback regulatory system of the phototransduction cascade using a combination of
molecular phylogenetic and gene synteny analyses, including new transcriptome data for a
number of key species, including hagfish, lamprey, rays, bowfin and gar. It provides a broad
perspective on the evolution of four gene families involved and suggests interesting conclusions
on the possible selective pressures underlying the specialisation of the multiple isoforms of the
proteins prior to 2R WGD. One of their most striking results concerns the arrangement of
vertebrate phototransduction genes into what may be a single paralogon. This has been hinted at
in previous studies, but such a comprehensive study had not been conducted. Overall, this
manuscript is both extensive and insightful, and will stand as a major contribution to the field of
vision biology and evolution. I only have minor comments and edits that can be addressed by the
authors.
Specific Comments and Minor Edits:
Given the comprehensive nature of their analyses, it would be nice to see a few more sentences
that emphasize the significance of their study. For example, their analyses suggest that recoverins
and visinins have been lost from major groups of vertebrates, and that many of these genes
appear to be incorrectly annotated in NCBI. Clearly more studies are needed that follow the
careful comparative approach followed in this paper.
4
Along these lines, it would also be useful to have suggestions for future directions to confirm
some of these interesting conclusions.
While the molecular modeling is a useful complement to the extensive evolutionary analyses, this
approach is unlikely to show structures very different from the crystal structures, and is perhaps
not as important as the phylogenetic analyses, and the analyses of synteny presented in this
study.
The ‘ultrafast bootstrap’ implemented in IQTree is not really a bootstrapping procedure, although
this is how the authors refer to it. (Instead it more like an approximation of the bootstrap.)
Line 248 & 258: Add “is” very likely
Line 392: Sentence isn’t clear in stating what vertebrate visinin could be sister to.
Line 399: Replace “either” with “neither” in our transcriptomes
Line 775: At a much lower intensity of steady light than “in normal conditions”?
Line 778: Add contribute “to these differences, they” have yet…
Figure 1: In the figure legend, the diagram has been arbitrarily been divided into “ six” not “four”
sections (A-F). The branching sketch is slightly confusing because it seems like the four rows
correspond to the branches of the sketch

Thank you. In fact, we have now managed to provide additional evidence that this is a single
paralogon, and we have also been able to make it clearer visually that Figure 2 overlaps with
Figure 1 (by left/right flipping Figure 2). Furthermore, we have also been able to show that two
additional phototransduction gene families, RGS9/11 and GNGT1/1, reside within the set of
genes in Figure 2. This has necessitated redrawing the Figure, rewording in the first paragraph
of section 2.3.2, and changing the legend; it has also required consequential minor adjustments
to Figures 1 and 7, as well as changes to the Abstract to refer to a single paralogon.
Overall, this manuscript is both extensive and insightful, and will stand as a major contribution
to the field of vision biology and evolution.
Thank you.
I only have minor comments and edits that can be addressed by the authors.

end of the Discussion.
Along these lines, it would also be useful to have suggestions for future directions to confirm
some of these interesting conclusions.
See previous response.

While the molecular modeling is a useful complement to the extensive evolutionary analyses,
this approach is unlikely to show structures very different from the crystal structures, and is
perhaps not as important as the phylogenetic analyses, and the analyses of synteny presented
in this study.
Agreed. But we do not place emphasis on this modelling, and we have already placed the
material in the Supplementary Figures.
The ‘ultrafast bootstrap’ implemented in IQTree is not really a bootstrapping procedure,
although this is how the authors refer to it. (Instead it more like an approximation of the
bootstrap.)
Agreed. In fact, this was already stated in the Methods, but we have now also added a sentence
at the first occurrence in the Results section (now line 375).
Line 248 & 258: Add “is” very likely
We prefer the existing wording.
Line 392: Sentence isn’t clear in stating what vertebrate visinin could be sister to.
Agreed. We have now revised Figure 3B to show the possible positions and we refer to this in
the revised text.
Line 399: Replace “either” with “neither” in our transcriptomes
We prefer the existing wording.
Line 775: At a much lower intensity of steady light than “in normal conditions”?
Changed to “than when the loop is intact”..
Line 778: Add contribute “to these differences, they” have yet…
Changed to “contribute to the disparities”.
Figure 1: In the figure legend, the diagram has been arbitrarily been divided into “ six” not
“four” sections (A-F).
Corrected.
The branching sketch is slightly confusing because it seems like the four rows correspond to the
branches of the sketch
The four rows are indeed intended to correspond to the four branches of the sketch.
Figure 6A: Do not see dotted arrow mentioned in figure legend.
Rather than showing an arrow in the constrained tree, for the position of the root in the original
unconstrained tree, we have now managed to construct an unconstrained rooted tree that has the
original topology, by using a different outgroup (the lancelet sequences). As a consequence, we
have revised the paragraph in section 2.6.2 where Figure 6A is presented.
Other changes
Here we set out some additional changes that we made, that are intended to clarify and amplify
our arguments, and that we think will make the work clearer to the reader.
4
1. We have made minor cosmetic changes to the phylogeny panels and the gene duplication
panels in Figures 3 and 6, in order to make to the correspondence between the branches in the
respective panels more obvious visually.
2. Further to our first response to Reviewer 2, regarding the existence of a single
‘phototransduction paralogon’:
(a) In addition to revising Figure 2, we have substantially rewritten the second half of section
2.1.1 in the Results, to more fully cover the description of the paralogon.
(b) We have substantially rewritten section 3.1 of the Discussion, to present our consideration
of this paralogon more clearly.
3. During revision, we learnt of the acceptance of a paper reporting that pinopsin evolved as the
ancestral dim-light opsin. We have added this as Ref. [72], with two sentences at line 874, and
we will finalise the details at proof stage.

17 ABSTRACT
18 We examined the genes encoding the proteins that mediate the Ca-feedback regulatory system in
19 vertebrate rod and cone phototransduction. These proteins comprise four families:
20 recoverin/visinin, the guanylyl cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs), the guanylyl cyclases
21 (GCs), and the sodium/calcium-potassium exchangers (NCKXs). We identified a paralogon
22 containing at least 3628 phototransduction genes from at least fourteeneight families, including
23 all fourthree of the families involved in the Ca-feedback loop (recoverin/visinin, GCAPs, GCs
24 and NCKXs). We also identified a second paralogous region containing another five
25 phototransduction genes, including recoverin/visinin, and it is possible that this comprises part
26 of the same paralogon. By combining analyses of gene synteny with analyses of the molecular
27 phylogeny for each of these four families of genes for Ca-feedback regulation, we have
28 established the likely pattern of gene duplications and losses underlying the expansion of
29 isoforms, both before and during the two rounds of whole-genome duplication (2R WGD) that
30 occurred in early vertebrate evolution. Furthermore, by combining our results with earlier
31 evidence on the timing of duplication of the visual G-protein receptor kinase genes, we propose
32 that specialisation of proto-vertebrate photoreceptor cells for operation at high and low light
33 intensities preceded the emergence of rhodopsin, which occurred during 2R WGD.

36 1. Background
37 The rod and cone photoreceptors of the vertebrate duplex retina, used respectively for night and
38 day vision, employ distinct protein isoforms for many of the components of the transduction
39 cascade. These cells therefore represent a unique evolutionary system, where the same process
40 (detection of light) utilises a distinct set of genes in different classes of cell. It has been
41 established that a major factor leading to the emergence of this duplex system was the
42 occurrence of the two rounds of whole-genome duplication (2R WGD; [1]) that are known to
43 have occurred at a very early stage in the evolution of vertebrates. A series of studies from
44 Larhammar’s group [2–7] reported evidence for extensive expansion of phototransduction gene
45 isoforms during 2R WGD. Recently, we extended those investigations by including genes from
46 several basal vertebrate lineages (the jawless or agnathan vertebrates, cartilaginous fish, and
47 basal bony fish). We obtained eye transcriptomes for nine taxa of interest, and applied
48 molecular phylogenetic analysis to curated sets of gene families. First, we examined the gene
49 families encoding the proteins involved in activation of the light response (the opsins;
50 transducins, GNATs; phosphodiesterases, PDE6s; and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels,
51 CNGCs) [8,9]. Then we examined the genes involved in shut-off of the light response (the
52 G-protein receptor kinases, GRKs; arrestins; regulators of G-protein signalling, RGS9s;
53 G-protein ß subunit 5, Gß5; and RGS anchor proteins, R9APs) [10]. We confirmed the
54 importance of 2R WGD in establishing distinct rod/cone isoforms in both the activation and the
55 shut-off steps in the phototransduction cascade, and we presented likely scenarios for the gene
56 duplications and losses that occurred during the evolution of each of the ten gene families that
57 we examined.
58 Here, we analyse the four gene families encoding the proteins that contribute to the important
59 Ca-feedback regulatory system that underlies photoreceptor light adaptation and that acts as a
60 protective mechanism against excessive concentrations of either cyclic GMP (cGMP) or
61 cytoplasmic Ca2+; the corresponding protein families are: recoverin/visinin, the guanylyl cyclase
62 activating proteins (GCAPs), the guanylyl cyclases (GCs), and the sodium/calcium-potassium
63 exchangers (NCKXs). In the Results section, we begin by identifying two paralogons: one that
64 includes 28 phototransduction genes, and a second that includes another five phototransduction
65 genes. Thereafter we consider in turn the four gene families that contribute to Ca-feedback. In
66 each case, we examine gene synteny and then construct molecular phylogenies. Together, these
67 analyses of synteny and phylogeny enable us to determine the likely scenario of gene
68 duplications that gave rise to the vertebrate photoreceptor’s Ca-feedback regulatory system.
69 Throughout this paper we have chosen to employ the protein name when referring to the
70 encoding gene, for several reasons. Firstly, for a number of the proteins, the genes have been
71 lost in human and the orthologs in other taxa do not have accepted gene names. Secondly, for
72 some genes there is inconsistency across vertebrates in the naming of orthologs (e.g. GUCY2D
73 and Gucy2e for the same ortholog). And finally, we think that the protein names are more easily
74 understood amongst photoreceptor neuroscientists.

76 1.1. Recoverin and visinin
77 Recoverin, visinin and the GCAPs are members of a family of neuronal calcium sensor proteins
78 (NCSs; reviewed in [11–13]) characterised by a sequence of roughly 200 residues with a highly-
79 conserved secondary structure comprising four EF-hand motifs. In comparison with other NCS
80 proteins, the first EF-hand in these photoreceptor proteins has an altered amino acid sequence
81 that prevents it from binding Ca2+; for the GCAPs, the remaining three motifs (EF2–EF4) bind
82 Ca2+, whereas only EF2 and EF3 bind Ca2+ in recoverin and visinin. Functionally, the GCAPs
83 exert a powerful dependence of guanylyl cyclase activity on Ca2+ concentration, whereas
84 recoverin provides only a weak Ca-dependence of phosphorylation activity by the G-protein
85 receptor kinases (GRKs).
86 Visinin was purified from chicken retina and identified as a Ca-binding protein in cones in 1983
87 [14] and was cloned in 1990 [15]. The following year, two closely related proteins were
88 discovered: S-modulin in frog rods [16], and recoverin in mammalian rods [17], though the
89 latter was incorrectly reported to be the Ca-sensitive regulator of guanylyl cyclase activity.
90 Since then a degree of misunderstanding has surrounded the three proteins, in part because
91 mammals lack the gene for visinin, and also because a distinct mammalian gene has been named
92 ‘visinin-like’ (VSNL1) and sometimes confused with visinin. Our analysis will show that
93 recoverin has been lost from sauropsids (reptiles and birds), whereas visinin has been lost from
94 cartilaginous fish and mammals (and possibly from coelacanth). As a result, it is only in
95 amphibia and bony fish that both isoforms can readily be found. Our analysis will also show
96 that recoverin and S-modulin are the same.
97 The cellular and molecular mechanism whereby recoverin exerts a degree of Ca-sensitivity on
98 the recovery phase of the photoresponse is partly understood (reviewed in [12]). Recoverin is
99 myristoylated at its N-terminus, and at low Ca2+ concentrations (as occur in bright light), the
100 protein binds Mg2+ and the myristoyl group is buried in a hydrophobic pocket within the protein
101 [18,19]; in this state recoverin interacts only weakly with membranes, and has little effect. But
102 when Ca2+ binds at the higher Ca2+ concentration characteristic of the dark state, a
103 conformational change occurs (a ‘myristoyl switch’ [20]) involving exposure of both the
104 myristoyl group and the hydrophobic pocket. This enables recoverin to bind to the membrane
105 and to interact with GRK1, inhibiting it and thereby slowing the phosphorylation of activated
106 rhodopsin. As a result, the elevated Ca2+ level at low light levels leads to an increase in lifetime
107 (and hence increased effectiveness) of any rhodopsins that are activated. Conversely, in bright
108 light the lifetime of activated rhodopsin is shortened. The light responses of recoverin knockout
109 mice are however only moderately shorter than those of WT mice [21], indicating that
110 recoverin’s role is modest. Unlike in the case for GCAPs, the binding of Mg2+ appears to have
111 little effect on recoverin [18,19].
112 In contrast to this relatively subtle effect of recoverin in rods, visinin in cones may have a more
113 pronounced effect. In vitro experiments on frog retina have shown that visinin and recoverin
114 exert indistinguishable effects on the GRKs [22]. However, the expression level of visinin in
4
115 frog cones is 20-fold higher than the expression level of recoverin in rods [22], providing the
116 potential for a more profound role of visinin in vivo.
117 1.2. Guanylyl cyclase activating proteins, GCAPs
118 Within the extensive set of neuronal calcium sensor proteins, the vertebrate genome includes a
119 family of guanylyl cyclase regulatory proteins (reviewed in [11–13]), comprising several
120 ‘activating’ proteins (GCAPs) and a single so-called ‘inhibitory’ protein (GCIP). Our analyses
121 of synteny and phylogeny will divide GCAPs into six sub-families, with teleost fish possessing
122 3R duplicates of several of these [23–25]. The best-studied members are GCAP1 (encoded by
123 GUCA1A) and GCAP2 (encoded by GUCA1B); these two genes are arranged tail-to-tail in
124 virtually all tetrapods, as well as in spotted gar, though not in teleosts.
125 In mammalian cones, the predominant isoform is GCAP1 [26]; the level of GCAP2 is species-
126 dependent, but is always much lower than GCAP1, or even absent. In zebrafish, an isoform that
127 we identify here as one member of the pair of GCAP1 duplicates (zGCAP5, here referred to as
128 GCAP1b), is cone-specific [23,24]. In mammalian rods, GCAP1 and GCAP2 are co-expressed,
129 with the level of GCAP2 being higher [27].
130 A third isoform, GCAP3 (encoded by GUCA1C) occurs in many species, and is expressed only
131 in cones, at least in human and zebrafish [28]; in the latter species, both 3R duplicates (zGCAP3
132 and zGCAP4, here referred to as GCAP3a and GCAP3b) are cone-specific [24,28,29]. A fourth
133 isoform, GCAP1-L, closely similar to GCAP1 and GCAP3, is often overlooked, probably
134 because it has been lost from mammals. Finally, another pair of isoforms closely similar to
135 GCAP2, and here referred to as GCAP2-A and GCAP2-B, occur in a number of vertebrate taxa.
136 As far as we are aware, very little is known about these last three isoforms (GCAP1-L,
137 GCAP2-A and GCAP2-B), except that in zebrafish the only 3R duplicate of GCAP2-B
138 (zGCAP7) is cone-specific [25].
139 GCAPs provide very powerful Ca-sensitive activation of guanylyl cyclases (GCs) [30]. Each
140 EF-hand, apart from the first, has the capacity to bind either Ca2+ or Mg2+; the first EF-hand is
141 instead modified to interface with GCs [31]. The molecular mechanism of GCAP activation at
142 lowered Ca2+ concentrations involves the binding of Mg2+ [32] to EF-2, and EF-3 and EF-4,
143 thereby inducing a conformational change; the role of EF4 is unclear. In contrast to the case for
144 recoverin, the overall change in tertiary structure for GCAP1 is relatively small [33].; in
145 particular the myristoyl group in GCAP1 remains fully buried in both states [34–36]; GCAP2
146 differs, in lacking the myristoyl group [35,36]. GCAP2 is also myristoylated, but whereas the
147 removal of the myristoyl group results in a seven-fold reduction in activity of GCAP1, it has
148 little effect on GCAP2 [37].
149 Recent evidence has shown that GCAP1 forms a functional homodimer [33], suggesting a 2:2
150 stoichiometry of interaction with the GC homodimer. In vitro experiments with mammalian
151 proteins have shown that GCAP1 and GCAP2 are able to activate the two GCs, GC-E and
152 GC-F, with comparable efficacy. Furthermore, mammalian rods co-express both GCs, as well
5
153 as both GCAPs. However, a clear functional specialisation has been established in rods in vivo,
154 with GCAP1 primarily regulating GC-E (Ret-GC1) [38]. However, GCAP1 and GCAP2 appear
155 to compete for overlapping site(s), and so the role of GCAP2 remains somewhat enigmatic and
156 GCAP2 primarily regulating GC-F (Ret-GC2) [38–40]. Functionally, the Ca2+ sensitivity of a
157 cell’s cyclase activity is determined by its GCAP(s), and GCAP1 activates at a higher Ca2+
158 concentration than GCAP2 (~140 nM cf ~50 nM). For rods, dim illumination causes only a
159 moderate decline in Ca2+ concentration and therefore triggers GCAP1/GC-E activation alone,
160 whereas bright illumination lowers the Ca2+ concentration substantially and hence additionally
161 triggers GCAP2/GC-F activation [39].
162 GCIP has been termed ‘inhibitory’ [41], but this nomenclature is potentially misleading. On its
163 own, GCIP stimulates GC only very slightly, and in the presence of a constitutively active
164 GCAP, it has no effect on GC activity when the Ca2+ concentration is very low [41]. On the
165 other hand, at very high Ca2+ concentrations the activation of GC by the constitutively-active
166 GCAP is blocked [41], presumably as a result of competition for binding to the GC. However, it
167 has not been established that GCIP plays an inhibitory functional role in vivo. Finally, although
168 GCIP was reported to label cone photoreceptors strongly in the inner segment and synaptic
169 terminal, but not in the outer segment, examination of the immunofluorescence images (Figure
170 6A of [41]) suggests that it may also be present in the outer segment.
171 1.3. Guanylyl cyclases, GCs
172 We will adopt the protein names GC-A to GC-G assigned by IUPHAR/BPS for the seven
173 transmembrane guanylyl cyclases encoded by the mammalian genome (see
174 www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=662). The properties
175 of these GCs have recently been reviewed in [42]. The two mammalian photoreceptor isoforms
176 are GC-F (=Ret-GC2), encoded by GUCY2F, and GC-E (=Ret-GC1), encoded by Gucy2e in
177 mouse and a number of other mammals, though by GUCY2D in human and many other species.
178 A third isoform, GC-D, often referred to as the ‘olfactory’ GC, does not occur in primates but is
179 present in most vertebrate taxa; in mouse the encoding gene is named Gucy2d, but in many taxa
180 it is unnamed. In zebrafish, our phylogenetic results identify the gene names as follows: gc3 =
181 GC-E (Ret-GC1), gc2 = GC-F (Ret-GC2), gucy2f = GC-D (‘olfactory’); in the Discussion we
182 will consider other reported claims of gene orthology. As a resultIn any case, there is
183 considerable potential for confusion regarding the isoform being referred to when using the gene
184 names, and therefore (as noted above) we will use the protein names. We will show that the
185 third so-called ‘olfactory’ isoform is expressed in the retina, at least in many aquatic taxa,
186 including bony, cartilaginous, and agnathan fish. Indeed, in our retina transcriptomes for bowfin
187 and Florida gar, the transcript levels for GC-D are similar to those for GC-F, and considerably
188 higher than for GC-E (see §2.5.3).
189 Several studies have shown that GC-E and GC-F are co-expressed in the rods of jawed
190 vertebrates. In mouse rods, GC-E is present at ~5× higher concentration than GC-F [39], yet the
191 catalytic activity of GC-F exceeds that of GC-E, with the result that GC-F contributes around
6
192 25–30% of the maximal cyclase activity. In cones of WT mouse [43] and zebrafish [24], it has
193 been reported that the only GC present is GC-E. In humans, mutations in the GC-E gene
194 (GUCY2D) are known to cause Leber congenital amaurosis type 1 (LCA1) [44], a recessive
195 childhood disease associated with severe vision loss, and dominant cone-rod dystrophy [45]. On
196 the other hand, no human retinal diseases have yet been linked to mutations in the GC-F gene
197 (GUCY2F).
198 These photoreceptor GCs synthesise cGMP, at a rate set by the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration
199 via the extent of their activation by GCAPs; however, the molecular mechanism of activation by
200 GCAPs has not yet been elucidated. The cyclase molecule is a long membrane-spanning
201 homodimer, in which seven functional domains have been identified [40,46,47]. In rods, the so-
202 called extracellular domain (ECD) is in fact intradiscal; of the remaining domains we will
203 mention only two. Generation of a functional catalytic site requires dimer formation, and this is
204 achieved through subunit interaction via the a-helical coiled-coil motif of a dimerization domain
205 (DD) in both partners [48]. In the dimer, the paired cyclase catalytic domains (CCDs) form the
206 catalytic centre where cGMP is synthesised [49]. Finally, it is interesting to note that during
207 their synthesis and transport to the outer segment, GCs appear to be protected from activation by
208 the binding of a Ca-insensitive protein, RD3 [43,50].
209 1.4. Sodium / calcium-potassium exchanger, NCKX
210 Ca2+ ions are extruded from rod and cone outer segments by a sodium/calcium-potassium
211 exchanger, NCKX (reviewed in [51,52]), that is able to operate at very low cytoplasmic Ca2+
212 levels because it utilises both the inward concentration gradient of Na+ and the outward
213 concentration gradient of K+. The exchanger operates ‘electrogenically’ [53], with a net influx
214 of one positive charge per Ca2+ extruded, because each cycle has a stoichiometry of 4 Na+ ions
215 transported inward, in exchange for 1 Ca2+ ion plus 1 K+ ion (i.e. three positive charges)
216 transported outward [54–56]. As a result, the operation of this exchanger can be measured in
217 intact cells under suitable conditions, by recording the electrogenic current.
218 In darkness, when cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs) are held open by a moderate
219 level of cGMP, there is a steady influx of Ca2+ ions through the relatively non-selective
220 channels, and this influx is balanced by an equal efflux of Ca2+ driven by the NCKX, generating
221 a moderately high free Ca2+ concentration of 200–500 µnM (see [56–58]). In bright light, all the
222 CNGCs are closed so that the influx of Ca2+ stops, but initially the efflux continues, resulting in
223 a drop in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration [59]. This drop is crucial in triggering rapid recovery
224 of the electrical response and in mediating light adaptation [60,61].
225 In the rod outer segment the NCKX protein forms a tight 2:1 association with CNGCs, with one
226 NCKX binding to each of the two a-subunits of the CNGC [62,63]. This protein complex in the
227 plasma membrane additionally interacts with peripherin-2 in the rim of the disc membranes via
228 the GARP (glutamic acid-rich protein) component of the CNGC ß-subunit [64], thereby
229 apparently providing stabilisation of the outer segment disc structure.
7
230 Rods express NCKX1 (encoded by SLC24A1) whereas cones express NCKX2 (encoded by
231 SLC24A2), and we will present evidence that these two isoforms arose during 2R WGD. They
232 are members of what has been designated Group 2 of a super-family of Ca2+/cation antiporters
233 (reviewed in [65]). Group 1 includes NCKX3, NCKX4 and NCKX5, and is likewise found only
234 in animals; Group 3 is found in land plants and algae.
235
236 2. Results
237 2.1. Syntenic arrangement of phototransduction genes
238 2.1.1. Many phototransduction genes are located in a paralogous region
239 In searching for synteny amongst the genes encoding the proteins of the calcium feedback loop,
240 we were struck by the close proximity of many sets of phototransduction genes to each other.
241 Figure 1 shows the configuration of more than 200 genes from 63 gene families for spotted gar
242 (Lepisosteus oculatus), with the linkage groups (chromosomes) indicated by horizontal lines; for
243 pictorial convenience the diagram has been split into six sections (A–F). To our astonishment,
244 we found that nine families comprising 28 genes directly involved (or implicated) in
245 phototransduction were located close to each other. The occurrence of multiple families of
246 genes, with paralogs arranged in a closely similar sequence across four chromosomes, is a
247 signature of the remnants of a quartet (paralogon) that arose during the two rounds of whole
248 genome duplication (2R WGD) that occurred very early in vertebrate evolution [1]. Although
249 we are confident that such a quartet arrangement holds at local levels within Figure 1, we cannot
250 be sure that the indicated arrangement of rows holds globally, across the entire set of genes.
251 Figure 1. A large paralogon of phototransduction genes
252 The rationale for our choices of row continuity in Figure 1, at ‘breaks’ in chromosomal
253 arrangement, is explained in the Methods (§4.1) and is based on comparison of gene locations
254 across three taxa (spotted gar, human, and chicken) as tabulated in Supplementary Table S1.
255 For the regions where the horizontal lines are shown thicker and coloured, we think it very likely
256 that the ancestral arrangement remains continuous across each of the four colours. On the other
257 hand, for the stretches of Figure 1 shown with thinner grey lines, we are less certain, and it is
258 possible that some chromosomal regions may need to be swapped. For example, in section C, it
259 may be that LG6 and LG4 should be interchanged between rows 1 and 4; likewise, in section D
260 and E, it may be that LG19 and LG24/LG27 should be interchanged. On the other hand, our
261 subsequent phylogenetic analysis for the NCKX sequences (§2.6) provides circumstantial
262 evidence to suggest that in section D the third and fourth rows (containing SLC24A1 and
263 SLC24A2) are correctly paired.
264 Overall, we are confident that the second section (B) forms a paralogon, and likewise that the
265 bottom section (F) also forms a paralogon, and furthermore we think it likely that these two
266 regions actually comprise two regions of the same paralogon. Although we acknowledge
8
267 uncertainty about continuity of the indicated rows (e.g. across the middle sections, C–E), we
268 hypothesise that the entire diagram may represent a single paralogon.
269 In Figure 1, there are five instances where we have represented a gene family using more than
270 one column (horizontal braces), on the basis of evidence for the occurrence of duplication(s) that
271 preceded 2R WGD. We have previously reported two of these cases: for the CNGAs [8] and the
272 visual opsins [9]. In the phylogenetic analyses in subsequent sections, we provide
273 corresponding evidence in the case of the GCAPs (§2.4) and the guanylyl cyclases (§2.5).
274 Finally, we note that in section E of Figure 1, the location of GCAP3 (encoded by GUCA1C) is
275 indicated as having been translocated in the spotted gar genome; the position of this gene also
276 appears unusual in several other genomes (Supplementary Table S2) and will be considered in
277 more detail in §2.4.
278 2.1.2. A second paralogous region containing phototransduction genes
279 Inspection of Figure 1 shows the absence of a few sets of phototransduction genes (e.g. for the
280 PDE6 catalytic and regulatory subunits, the G-protein <U+03B3>-subunits, and recoverin and visinin). In
281 attempting to identify gene synteny for recoverin and visinin, a significant complication is that
282 relatively few taxa retain the genes for both isoforms; notably, though, ray-finned fish and
283 amphibia frequently retain both. The genome that we have primarily analysed is that of the
284 spotted gar, but unfortunately the current assembly does not include the gene for visinin; we
285 suspect that the gene exists in this species, because our retinal transcriptome for the closely
286 related Florida gar (L. platyrhincus) contains transcripts for both recoverin and visinin.
287 Therefore, we also examined the genomes of Xenopus tropicalis and Anolis carolinensis, though
288 these have the disadvantage of shorter scaffold lengths. In addition, and despite the
289 complication of 3R, we chose to examine the zebrafish genome, which contains a pair of
290 recoverin genes (RCVRNA and RCVRNB) and a pair of visinin genes (named RCVRN2 and
291 RCVRN3); to minimise confusion in relation to these isoforms, we will refer to the latter pair as
292 visinin-A and visinin-B.
293 Figure 2 provides what we consider to be compelling evidence for a paralogon containing three
294 five phototransduction gene families, namely: recoverin/visinin, GNB1/3 and, PDE6G/H/I,
295 RGS9/11 and GNGT1/2. The top four rows are from spotted gar, and provide preliminary clear
296 evidence for the existence of a paralogon; the upper right section (grey background) shows
297 continuity with Figure 1. Although several anticipated genes are absent from LG26, we found
298 orthologs in the anole and Xenopus genomes (middle next two rows), providing evidence that
299 permitted us to identify the location of the visinin gene. Additional confirmation for the
300 structure of this paralogon is provided by the lowermost subsequent four rows, which examine
301 the chromosomal regions in zebrafish that contain paralogs of recoverin and visinin. (To avoid
302 excessive complication, we have not presented data for these other three taxa corresponding to
303 the top two (unshaded) spotted gar linkage groups, LG14/LG13 and LG25/LG12.) Finally, to
304 provide evidence for contiguity across the extent of Figure 2, the bottom row shows the genes
305 from a single section on chromosome 2 of the opossum, Monodelphis domestica.
9
306 Figure 2. A second paralogous region
307 We interpret the yellow-shaded rows in Figure 2 to identify the arrangement of genes in the
308 vicinity of visinin, and the cyan-shaded rows to identify the arrangement in the vicinity of
309 recoverin. Thus, the yellow shading of zebrafish chromosomes ZF16 and ZF19 shows 3R
310 duplicates from a presumed ancestral chromosome containing visinin, that existed after 2R and
311 that is now represented by spotted gar LG26 and the short scaffolds of anole and frog; various of
312 those ancestral genes have subsequently been lost from spotted gar, anole and frog. Likewise,
313 the cyan shading of zebrafish chromosomes ZF3 and ZF12 shows 3R duplicates from a
314 presumed ancestral post-2R chromosome containing recoverin, that is now represented by
315 spotted gar LG10. From these results we conclude that the expansion of recoverin and visinin
316 occurred during 2R WGD, though we are unable to determine whether their divergence occurred
317 at the first or second round.
318 We interpret the orange rows (that are joined by the dotted lines at the left) to identify the
319 common arrangement of genes in the vicinity of recoverin. Thus, zebrafish chromosomes ZF3
320 and ZF12 show the 3R duplicates from a presumed ancestral post-2R chromosome containing
321 recoverin, that is now represented in spotted gar by LG10/LG2 and in opossum by chromosome
322 2. Likewise, we interpret the green rows (that are joined by the dashed lines at the right) to
323 identify the genes in the vicinity of visinin. Thus, zebrafish chromosomes ZF16 and ZF19 show
324 the 3R duplicates from a presumed ancestral chromosome containing visinin, that existed after
325 2R and that is now represented in spotted gar by LG26 and in anole and frog by several short
326 scaffolds; various of those ancestral genes have subsequently been lost from spotted gar, anole
327 and frog.
328 By comparison with the human and chicken genomes (data not shown), and also with the
329 opossum genome (bottom row), it is clear that the top row and the fourth row in Figure 2
330 represent the corresponding top and fourth rows in Figure 1, and accordingly we have coloured
331 them blue and orange, respectively. From these results we conclude that the expansion of
332 recoverin and visinin occurred during 2R WGD. However, despite extensive efforts, we were
333 not able to conclusively associate the second or third rows in Figure 2 with individual rows in
334 Figure 1. We have chosen to place LG26 on the third row, and therefore to colour it green,
335 because our subsequent phylogenetic analysis (§2.3.1) shows a marginal preference for the
336 divergence of visinin and recoverin having occurred at the second round of 2R WGD. However,
337 we cannot rule out the possibility that LG26 should actually be placed on the second row, so that
338 the red and green rows would be interchanged.
339 By combining the results from Figures 1 and 2, we conclude that almost all of the genes directly
340 involved in phototransduction (at least 35 genes, for activation, shut-off, and Ca-feedback)
341 appear to be located within just two paralogous regions. Furthermore, as we shall consider in
342 the Discussion, the overlap of several gene families (GNBs, CLSTNs and SLC2As) across
343 Figures 1 and 2 may indicate that the entire set of genes was originally located in a single
344 paralogon. The most important gene family that is not present in Figures 1 or 2 is PDE6A/B/C.
10
345 There is a hint that these genes might form part of the same paralogon, because in spotted gar
346 they are located on LG6, LG2 and LG5, but we have not found clear-cut evidence to support this
347 possibility.Recently, Lagman et al [7] showed that this set of genes resides in a paralogous
348 region, and although in spotted gar the genes are located on LG6, LG2 and LG5 (which appear
349 prominently in Figure 1), we have not found conclusive evidence linking them to the paralogon
350 of Figures 1 and 2. In the Discussion we will give further consideration to this and other
351 potential members of the paralogon.
352 2.2. Sequences obtained from transcriptomes for agnathans and basal
353 jawed vertebrates
354 We searched our transcriptome data (as described in Methods, §4.2) for sequences that were
355 close hits against each of the four families of Ca-feedback components: recoverin and visinin,
356 GCAPs, guanylyl cyclases, and NCKXs. For the sequences obtained, we conducted multiple
357 sequence alignment against a curated set of database sequences, followed by phylogenetic
358 analysis, and structural analysis, and we used the combined analysis in annotating the sequences.
359 The 73 new sequences have been deposited in GenBank with nucleotide accession numbers
360 MH577347–MH577419. Features of the entire set of sequences are listed in Supplementary
361 Table S3. For ease of reference, we now summarise in Table 1 the transcript levels for isoforms
362 from selected species; these cases will be referred to in the following sections.
363 Table 1. Transcript levels for selected species
364 2.3. Recoverin and visinin
365 2.3.1. Molecular phylogeny of recoverin and visinin
366 For recoverin/visinin, we considered gene synteny in §2.1.2, and so we now move directly to
367 phylogeny. By BLASTing against chicken visinin, we located more than a dozen very close hits
368 across reptiles, birds and bony fish, though most of these sequences were named recoverin,
369 recoverin-like, recoverin 2, or visinin-like. In addition, our eye transcriptomes provided
370 transcripts for a visinin, expressed at high level, in bowfin and Florida gar. For agnathan
371 species, we found a pair of hits to recoverin/visinin in P. marinus and L. camtshaticum, and our
372 transcriptome provided corresponding pairs in both our lamprey species, but none from hagfish.
373 The multiple sequence alignment for our curated set of recoverins and visinins is presented as
374 Supplementary File 1.
375 For the set of recoverins and visinins, from jawed and agnathan vertebrates, the sequence
376 alignment over the first 189 residues was so tight that there were no gaps at all, while for the
377 outgroup members, there were just two gaps (of a single residue and a pair of residues).
378 However, for the remaining dozen or so C-terminal residues, MAFFT and Clustal generated
379 somewhat different alignments. Therefore, in constructing phylogenies, we tried both
380 alignments as well as truncating all sequences after residue 189; in addition we tested the WAG
381 and LG substitution models. In all cases the resulting trees were closely similar.
11
382 We encountered a minor problem rooting the trees, because the nearest outgroup sequences we
383 could locate were quite distant, with an average of ~0.7 substitutions per residue. Therefore we
384 began by ignoring the outgroup and constructing an unrooted phylogeny. The tree we obtained
385 is presented in Supplementary Figure 1, and had identical topology (Robinson-Foulds distance =
386 0) with the WAG and LG substitution models. Importantly, bootstrap support for the four
387 vertebrate clades is unanimous (in terms of IQ-Tree’s approximate bootstrap percentage,
388 hereinafter referred to simply as bootstrap support). The four branches are long, and the two
389 jawed vertebrate clades are separated from the two agnathan clades by only a short branch,
390 though support for this topology is quite high (95% for both WAG and LG). With four clades,
391 there are two other possible topologies, in each case with a jawed vertebrate clade sister to an
392 agnathan vertebrate clade. When we applied tests of topology, we found that neither of those
393 alternative topologies could be rejected in any of the three tests. Therefore, we conclude that the
394 four vertebrate clades are genuinely distinct from each other, but we cannot be sure of their
395 topology relative to each other.
396 When we included the outgroup sequences in the analysis, the root in the unconstrained tree was
397 placed either adjacent to the recoverins (WAG model) or adjacent to the agnathan RecVis-Y
398 clade (LG model). These alternative positions obtained for the root in the unconstrained trees
399 are sketched by the dotted arrows in the constrained tree that we present in Figure 3A. The
400 discrepancy between the root positions obtained for the two substitutions models suggests that
401 the large phylogenetic distance to the outgroup sequences precludes reliable placement of the
402 root in an unconstrained phylogeny.
403 Figure 3. Recoverin/visinin phylogeny and duplications
404 We next examined the consequences of constraining the topology to be consistent with
405 divergence during 2R, as required to explain our gene synteny results in Figure 2. The simplest
406 way of achieving this, and the one that turned out to exhibit the highest likelihood, was to shift
407 the root by one node (for either the WAG or LG substitution model), to the position shown in
408 Figure 3A; the fully expanded tree is presented in Supplementary Figure S2. Interestingly,
409 despite the different root positions in the two unconstrained trees, the constrained trees had
410 identical topology for the two substitution model. Application of the constraint caused only a
411 small change in log likelihood, <U+2206>LogL, of 4.3 with WAG, or 4.2 with LG, and in both cases the
412 constrained tree passed all three tests of topology when compared with the corresponding
413 unconstrained tree, with a probability in the Approximately Unbiased test of p-AU = 0.47 for
414 WAG and 0.43 for LG.
415 Another potential 2R scenario that passed the tests, though at slightly lower probability, was
416 with recoverin diverging from the other three isoforms at 1R. However, in this case support
417 within the recoverin clade dropped to ~75%, which is suggestive of a problem. For the two
418 possible combinations of positions of the agnathan clades, and for both substitution models, we
419 obtained <U+2206>LogL <U+F0BB> 7, and the tree passed the three tests with p-AU <U+F0BB> 0.2–0.3. Therefore we
12
420 cannot exclude the possibility that recoverin diverged from the other three isoforms at 1R. Two
421 scenarios that failed our tests of topology (though only marginally) involved expansion
422 occurring only at the second round of WGD, so that each agnathan clade is sister to a jawed
423 vertebrate clade. Both combinations of such pairings yielded <U+2206>LogL <U+F0BB> 10, and both failed at
424 least two of the tests, for the WAG and LG substitution models, though p-AU was close to 0.05.
425 2.3.2. Pattern of gene duplications and losses for recoverin and visinin genes
426 In light of this analysis, our preferred scenario for the origin of the four clades is presented in
427 Figure 3B, where the position of visinin is indicated by the heavy dashed arrow, and corresponds
428 to the position shown for LG26 in Figure 2. However, although this topology is the most
429 plausible of the possible 2R models, on the basis of its smallest <U+2206>LogL and largest p-AU, we
430 cannot rule out the possibility that jawed vertebrate visinin is instead sister to one or other of the
431 two agnathan isoforms, as indicated by the two dotted arrows in Figure 3B. In order to
432 distinguish between these cases, we would need a conclusive means of assigning the gene
433 groupings for visinin in Figure 2 (spotted gar LG26 and zebrafish ZF3 and ZF19) to either the
434 green or red rows in Figure 1.1R/2R pairings to the four linkage groups for spotted gar in Figure
435 2.
436 Inspection of the fully-expanded tree in Supplementary Figure 2 shows the absence of any avian
437 or reptilian taxa in the sub-tree for recoverin, leading us to conclude that recoverin has been lost
438 from sauropsids; it is presumably because of this loss that most of the sauropsid visinins in the
439 NCBI database are incorrectly annotated as recoverins. For cartilaginous fish species, we were
440 unable to identify any visinins, either in our transcriptomes (see Table 1 and Supplementary
441 Table S3) or in the NCBI database. Inspection of the sub-tree for visinin in Supplementary
442 Figure 2 shows the absence of mammalian and cartilaginous fish species, and we conclude that
443 the visinin gene been lost from those two lineages.
444 As indicated by the red and blue colouring in Figure 3, we propose that the ancestral jawed
445 vertebrate utilised visinin in its cones and recoverin in its rods. This arrangement is retained in
446 frog [22], but the situation has not, to our knowledge, been investigated in other ‘non-3R’ taxa.
447 We presume that those taxa that have lost one of the genes use the other isoform in both classes
448 of photoreceptor.
449 2.3.3. Structure of recoverin/visinin in lampreys and cartilaginous fish
450 For the eight lamprey proteins in the recoverin/visinin family (four encoded by our transcripts,
451 and four from P. marinus and L. camtschaticum), we examined the key sites for Ca2+ binding in
452 the four EF hands. Table 2 shows that, for all of the agnathan sequences, EF2 and EF3 possess
453 canonical Ca2+-binding sites formed by acidic residues for Ca2+ coordination, whereas EF1 and
454 EF4 lack the key residues for Ca2+ binding. In fact, the residues at the critical positions 1, 3, 5
455 and 12 (see [66]) were completely conserved, as Asp, Asn, Asp, Glu in EF2, and as Asp, Asp,
456 Asn, Glu in EF3, across every member of the recoverin/visinin family and also the outgroup (see
457 Supplementary File 1), with the sole exception of a single Asn/Asp substitution in one of the
13
458 pair of zebrafish recoverins. Thus, for every recoverin/visinin sequence that we examined, from
459 lampreys as well as jawed vertebrates, four EF hands were present, but only EF2 and EF3 could
460 bind Ca2+.
461 Table 2. Residues in EF-hands for recoverin/visinins and GCAPs
462 In addition we modelled the predicted protein structure against a common recoverin template
463 and, as shown in Supplementary Figure S3, each protein generated the expected structure. As in
464 mammalian recoverin, there were two domains (N-terminal and C-terminal), with each domain
465 containing two EF-hand motifs forming a helix-loop-helix structure with two perpendicularly
466 placed a-helices and a connecting loop. We therefore conclude that all of these
467 recoverin/visinin proteins are likely to be fully functional, and to perform roles in
468 phototransduction similar to the roles reported for recoverin and visinin in other species.
469 The upper section of Table 1 summarises the transcript levels that we detected for the pairs of
470 recoverin/visinin isoforms in our two species of lamprey. In M. mordax, which has only a single
471 class of photoreceptor and which expresses only the LWS opsin, we found transcripts for both
472 isoforms, though with the level for RecVis-X around 6-fold higher than for RecVis-Y. In
473 G. australis, which has five classes of retinal photoreceptor and five opsins, the ratio was even
474 greater, at more than 40-fold. Thus, it would seem likely that each class of lamprey
475 photoreceptor expresses both isoforms of recoverin/visinin, but with a low level of RecVis-Y,
476 although it may reflect restriction of RecVis-Y to one of the less common classes of
477 photoreceptor.
478 2.4. Guanylyl cyclase activating proteins, GCAPs
479 2.4.1. Syntenic arrangement of the genes encoding GCAPs
480 The syntenic arrangement of spotted gar genes neighbouring those encoding the GCAPs was
481 presented in section E of Figure 1, and the corresponding arrangements in human and chicken
482 are presented in Supplementary Table S1. As mentioned previously, the genes encoding
483 GCAP1 and GCAP2 are arranged tail-to-tail in this and many other species. A striking feature
484 of Figure 1E is the close proximity of this family of genes to the genes for the visual opsins and
485 GNAI/GNAT in Figure 1F. Thus, on spotted gar LG3, GCAP1 and GCAP2 are within 4 Mb of
486 Rh2 and GNAT2, and correspondingly, on LG8, GCAP1-L is within 3 Mb of SWS1. Because
487 of this proximity, we hypothesise that all of these gene families formed part of a single ancestral
488 paralogon.
489 The location of the GCAP3 gene (GUCA1C) on the same chromosome (LG3) as the GCAP1 and
490 GCAP2 genes is unusual in spotted gar; in most genomes, GCAP3 is located on a chromosome
491 other than the one containing GCAP1 and GCAP2 (e.g. Supplementary Table S2). We were not
492 able to identify a consistent chromosomal relationship between GCAP3 and other gene families,
493 when examined across taxa. Thus, although we found a set of at least six other genes in the
494 vicinity of GUCA1C (namely TRAT1, CD47, NECTIN3, C3orf52, TAGLN3 and TMPRSS7) that
14
495 were syntenic across at least six taxa (spotted gar, anole, chicken, opossum, mouse and human)
496 as shown in Supplementary Table S2, we were not able to detect a consistent pattern in their
497 position relative to other genes. In the case of spotted gar, we hypothesise that GCAP3
498 (GUCA1C) and several nearby genes have been translocated on to LG3 from an ancestral
499 location on another linkage group, corresponding to one of the top two rows of the quartet in
500 Figure 1. We have illustrated this hypothesis using the dotted arrow in Figure 1E, where we
501 suggest that the ancestral position of GCAP3 may have been on the second row; however, on the
502 evidence available to us, it might equally have been on the top row.
503 We recently provided phylogenetic evidence supporting the likelihood that GNAI1 and GNAI3
504 diverged from GNAI2 at the first round of 2R WGD [9]. Therefore, as GCAP1 and GCAP1-L
505 are located on the same pair of linkage groups as GNAI1 and GNAI2, we conclude from Figure
506 1E that GCAP1 and GCAP1-L are very likely to have diverged from GCAP3 at 1R.
507 In Figure 1, we have divided the seven GCAP/GCIP genes into three families (indicated by three
508 columns), for reasons that will become clear from the phylogenetic analysis in the next section.
509 In particular, we have placed GCIP in a family separate from GCAP2. Of the two additional
510 GCAP2-like isoforms, we found GCAP2-A in eight taxa, but GCAP2-B only in bony fish
511 (bowfin, spotted gar, Florida gar, zebrafish and medaka). In spotted gar, GCAP2-A and
512 GCAP2-B are arranged head-to-tail on LG27, suggesting that the pair probably arose via a local
513 duplication. For the only other taxon we found (medaka) that possesses both isoforms, and that
514 has a genome assembly, GCAP2-A and GCAP2-B are about 5 Mb apart on chromosome 3.
515 With only two occurrences of both isoforms, there is little that we can surmise about their
516 relationship.
517 2.4.2. Molecular phylogeny of GCAPs
518 The multiple sequence alignment for our curated set of GCAPs is given in Supplementary File 2.
519 Figure 4A presents the unconstrained molecular phylogeny for jawed vertebrate GCAPs in
520 collapsed form, obtained using the same set of outgroup sequences that we used for recoverin
521 and visinin in Figure 3A; the fully-expanded tree is shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Six of
522 the seven jawed vertebrate clades exhibit bootstrap support of at least 96%, and the three sub-
523 trees are supported unanimously. The main branching pattern of ((1/L/3, 2/A/B), GCIP) is
524 supported at a bootstrap level of 99%, and provides the basis for our depiction of GCIP on a
525 separate column in Figure 1E. In the absence of this phylogeny, it might have appeared
526 appropriate to place GCIP in the same column as 2/A/B in Figure 1E.
527 Within the 1/L/3 sub-tree, the placement of GCAP1 as sister to GCAP1-L is supported at a level
528 of 93%, and this topology conforms to the paralogon arrangement that we deduced above for
529 this set of genes. Interestingly though, when we constrained GCAP3 to be sister to GCAP1-L,
530 we could not rule out the resulting tree on the basis of phylogeny alone, because the constrained
531 tree showed a relatively small change in log likelihood, of <U+2206>LogL = 3.5, and it passed the three
532 tests of topology with p-AU = 0.18. Thus, phylogeny on its own is not sufficient to define the
15
533 topology within the GCAPs 1/L/3 sub-tree, but the combination of phylogeny and synteny
534 provides compelling evidence.
535 Figure 4. GCAPs phylogeny and duplications
536 When we additionally included lamprey sequences in the phylogeny, we initially obtained trees
537 with rather poor bootstrap support for several clades. We think that this may have resulted from
538 the loss of the GCAP1-L clade from all mammalian species, with the possible result that the
539 remaining two main clades (GCAP1 and GCAP2) have been subjected to different pressures in
540 mammals from the pressures on their orthologs in other taxa. In any case, we found that by
541 omitting all mammalian sequences when we included lamprey sequences, we could obtain a
542 highly plausible tree that conformed to the topology shown in Figure 4 for jawed vertebrate
543 sequences alone, and that, with a constraint, also conformed to 2R WGD followed by A-J
544 speciation (Supplementary Figure S5). Thus, the constraint ((GCAP1-X,GCAP1-L),
545 (GCAP1-Y,GCAP1)) caused only a minor change in log likelihood, of <U+2206>LogL = 2.5, and the tree
546 passed all tests of topology, with p-AU = 0.38. We also tried the alternate topology,
547 ((GCAP1-Y,GCAP1-L), (GCAP1-X,GCAP1)), and again the tree passed all tests of topology,
548 though with a slightly larger change in log likelihood, of <U+2206>LogL = 4.2, and with p-AU = 0.12; in
549 addition, the constrained sub-tree was a tetrafurcation. We conclude that there are no grounds
550 for rejecting the hypothesis that jawed vertebrate 1/L and agnathan X/Y clades arose in the
551 second round of 2R WGD duplication followed by speciation, though we cannot assign
552 orthologs unambiguously. On the other hand, in the 2/A/B sub-tree of Supplementary Figure
553 S5, there was high bootstrap support (94%) for the clade of four lamprey sequences being sister
554 to jawed vertebrate GCAP2, so we conclude that they are orthologs and have annotated these
555 sequences as GCAP2 (rather than as GCAP2-X).
556 2.4.3. Pattern of duplications of GCAP genes and their subsequent loss in different
557 lineages
558 By combining the analyses of synteny (Figure 1E) and phylogeny (Figure 4A and
559 Supplementary Figure S5), our proposed scenario for the gene duplications and losses
560 underlying the origin of GCAPs is presented in Figure 4B. An ancestral neuronal calcium
561 sensor (NCS) duplicated to form GCIP and an ancestral GCAP; subsequently that GCAP
562 duplicated locally to form the 1/L/3 and 2/A/B divisions. Although we have illustrated these
563 first two duplications as occurring after the divergence of tunicates, there is scant evidence to
564 determine that timing. Following the first round (1R) of genome duplication, a single gene loss
565 occurred (in the GCIP lineage), and then after the second round (2R) four losses occurred. In
566 conformity with our choice in Figure 1E, we have chosen to illustrate GCAP3 on the
567 chromosome that does not contain GCAP2-A/B, but it is possible that GCAP3 might originally
568 have been on that other block. The magenta names in the right-hand column denote the
569 isoforms in lampreys. The tree in Supplementary Figure S5 supports the notion that each of
570 these lamprey isoforms is orthologous with a jawed vertebrate isoform; nevertheless, we have
16
571 retained the terminology GCAP1-X and GCAP1-Y until their orthology is established with more
572 certainty.
573 Subsequent to their expansion during 2R WGD, various isoforms have been lost from different
574 lineages, though GCAP2 has been retained in all the major lineages. Notably, mammals have
575 lost GCAP1-L, which is retained in each of the other major lineages, where it forms the most
576 highly-conserved of all the GCAP clades; hence, its loss from mammals may have been very
577 significant. Sharks and rays have lost both GCAP1 and GCAP3, and retain only GCAP1-L from
578 the 1/L/3 group; however, the elephant shark, a chimera, retains both. GCAP2-A and GCAP2-B
579 are found in only a few jawed vertebrate taxa, and appear not to be present in agnathan taxa.
580 GCIP, which appears not to have duplicates remaining from 2R, has been lost from cartilaginous
581 fish and from amniotes.
582 The second section in Table 1 summarises the levels of GCAP transcripts for selected taxa.
583 Interestingly, in both bowfin and Florida gar we found transcripts for all six jawed vertebrate
584 isoforms, though GCAP3 and GCAP2-B were present at lower levels than the other four
585 isoforms (GCAP1, GCAP1-L, GCAP2 and GCAP2-A). In cartilaginous fish, we detected only
586 GCAP2 and GCAP1-L, with the former present at 3–4 times the level of the latter. In lampreys,
587 it is likely that GCAP1-X is orthologous to jawed vertebrate GCAP1-L (see Supplementary
588 Figure S5), and this would provide consistency of expression levels of 1/L/3 isoforms across
589 agnathan and cartilaginous fish taxa. If this is correct, then the GCAP isoforms expressed in the
590 photoreceptors of lampreys and cartilaginous fish would comprise GCAP2 and GCAP1-L
591 (=GCAP1-X), together with a trace level of GCAP1-Y (=GCAP1) in G. australis.
592 2.4.4. Functional groups and structure of GCAPs in agnathan and cartilaginous fish
593 For each of our GCAP and GCIP sequences from agnathan, cartilaginous and basal fish, we
594 examined the residues in the EF-hands and we modelled each protein’s molecular structure. In
595 every case the structure could be modelled onto existing GCAP templates (Supplementary
596 Figure S6) and the critical residues in EF2 – EF4 conformed to the requirements for binding
597 Ca2+, as shown for the agnathan sequences in Table 2. The critical locations are at sites 1, 3, 5
598 and 12 in each EF-hand loop, and the required residues at these sites are Asp, (Asp/Asn),
599 (Asp/Asn/Ser) and Glu, respectively (reviewed in [66]). However, although we can be confident
600 that each of these sequences binds Ca2+ at each of the three EF-hands, the subtle differences seen
601 in the agnathan GCAP2 sequences and the GCIP sequences might impact on the properties of
602 Ca2+ binding.
603 As mentioned previously, jawed vertebrate GCAP1s and GCAP2 both possess an N-terminal
604 myristoyl group whereas GCAP2s do not [35,36]. To assess the likelihood of myristoylation in
605 agnathan GCAPs, we used the ‘Myristoylator’ program (https://web.expasy.org/myristoylator).
606 This predicted the presence of a myristoyl group in each lamprey GCAP1-X/GCAP1-Y and the
607 absence of a myristoyl in each lamprey GCAP2, consistent with our classification of these
608 sequences on phylogenetic grounds. For the GCIPs, Myristoylator likewise predicted that the
17
609 sequences from jawed vertebrates (e.g. Xenopus and zebrafish) will be myristoylated, but, as the
610 two sequences from lampreys (P. marinus and L. camtschaticum) both lack the requisite Gly
611 residue immediately following the N-terminal Met, it follows that these agnathan GCIPs cannot
612 be myristoylated.
613 2.5. Guanylyl cyclases, GCs
614 2.5.1. Syntenic arrangement of guanylyl cyclase genes
615 Section B of Figure 1 shows the arrangement of spotted gar genes in the vicinity of those
616 encoding the guanylyl cyclases, and the corresponding arrangements in human and chicken are
617 presented in Supplementary Table S1. The most striking feature is that the three GC genes on
618 spotted gar LG2, LG3 and LG7 appear to be part of the same paralogon identified for the
619 arrestin and visual GRK genes [2,3]. From our recent phylogenetic analysis [10], we concluded
620 that the two visual arrestins diverged from the two ß-arrestins at 1R, and likewise that GRK7
621 diverged from the two GRK1s at 1R. Accordingly, the simplest interpretation of the
622 arrangement in Figure 1B would be that GC-F diverged from GC-D and GC-E at 1R but, as
623 detailed below, this does not appear to be the correct interpretation.
624 2.5.2. Molecular phylogeny of guanylyl cyclases
625 The multiple sequence alignment for our curated set of GCs is presented in Supplementary File
626 3. Figure 5A presents the unconstrained molecular phylogeny for these visual and ‘olfactory’
627 GCs, from jawed and agnathan vertebrate taxa, in collapsed form; the fully-expanded tree is
628 given in Supplementary Figure S7. Bootstrap support in this unconstrained tree is remarkably
629 high, being at least 98% at every node. There is unanimous support for GC-F being sister to
630 GC-D (and unanimous support within those two sub-trees), as well as 98% support for GC-E
631 being sister to this pair. Therefore, given that we interpret Figure 1B to show GC-F having
632 diverged from GC-D at 1R, we are left with the conclusion that the GC-E and GC-D/GC-F
633 divisions must have existed prior to the two rounds of whole genome duplication.
634 To test whether the hagfish and lamprey sequences could reasonably constitute a single clade,
635 we applied constrained tree inference and found that this possibility was decisively rejected in
636 all three tests of topology, with p-AU < 0.004. On the other hand, we could not reject the
637 possibility that the hagfish sequence was in fact a member of the GC-E clade, because the tree
638 constrained in that way (Supplementary Figure S8) passed all three tests of topology at a
639 borderline level, with p-AU = 0.055.
640 Figure 5. Guanylyl cyclase phylogeny and duplications
641 2.5.3. Pattern of duplications and losses for guanylyl cyclase genes
642 Our interpretation of the gene duplications and losses required to reconcile our results for
643 synteny (Figure 1B) and phylogeny (Figure 5A) is presented in Figure 5B. We propose that an
644 ancestral ‘visual’ GC underwent local duplication twice prior to 2R WGD. Of the resulting
18
645 three ‘pre-2R’ genes, the only one to have expanded during WGD was ‘D/F’, to generate GC-D
646 and GC-F. In this proposed scheme, we need to assume extensive loss of genes, as indicated by
647 the short lines in Figure 5B.
648 Interestingly, GC-D is present in all the major lineages and in the great majority of taxa, with the
649 notable exception of primates, where it is a pseudogene. In mouse (and presumably in other
650 non-primate mammals) it is not expressed in the retina, but instead only in a subset of olfactory
651 receptor neurons, where it functions as the receptor molecule for detecting CO2 and the proteins
652 guanylin and uroguanylin (reviewed in [42]). In contrast, in the retina transcriptome for each of
653 our cartilaginous and basal bony fish taxa, we found transcripts for GC-D present at substantial
654 levels (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3). Indeed, in bowfin, GC-D was the principal
655 isoform present, with a transcript level 3-fold higher than for GC-E; we did not detect GC-F.
656 The most obvious explanation would be that, in these aquatic species, GC-D is expressed in
657 retinal photoreceptors where it plays a role comparable to that played by GC-E and GC-F in
658 mammalian cones and rods.
659 2.5.4. Functional domains of the guanylyl cyclase proteins in agnathan taxa
660 Examination of the amino acid sequences for our agnathan transcripts showed that all seven of
661 the functional domains referred to in §1.3 were present in each of the sequences (Supplementary
662 Figure S9). We next examined the degree of amino acid divergence between these functional
663 domains, for the three agnathan sequences in comparison with a reference sequence, chosen as
664 the human sequence in the closest clade (GC-E). Supplementary Table S4 lists the mean
665 number of amino acid substitutions per residue, for the seven domains. Over each of the first
666 five domains, the degree of divergence between the agnathan and human sequences is
667 substantial (around 0.4–0.7 substitutions/residue), whereas for the final two domains (DD and
668 CCD) the divergence is much smaller. Indeed, for the dimerisation domain, DD, the three
669 agnathan sequences are identical, and differ by only a single residue from the human sequence.
670 For the catalytic domain, CCD, the two lamprey sequences show a divergence from human (and
671 from each other) of only ~0.1 substitutions/residue, whereas the hagfish sequence is marginally
672 more divergent. We interpret the high level of sequence identity within these last two regions to
673 indicate that agnathan photoreceptor GC sequences are highly likely to form dimers and to
674 synthesise cGMP in a manner closely similar to their jawed vertebrate paralogs. We further
675 interpret the considerably lower levels of identity in the other domains to suggest that their
676 regulation by GCAPs might exhibit qualitative and quantitative differences from the situation in
677 jawed vertebrates.
678 2.6. Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchangers, NCKXs
679 2.6.1. Syntenic arrangement of photoreceptor NCKX genes, SLC24A1 and SLC24A2
680 Section D of Figure 1 shows the arrangement of genes in the vicinity of those encoding the
681 photoreceptor NCKXs, SLC24A1 and SLC24A2 in spotted gar, and the patterns in human and
19
682 chicken are presented in Supplementary Table S1. This arrangement strongly suggests that the
683 duplication of the two visual NCKX genes occurred during 2R. On the other hand, we have
684 scant evidence that the rows shown in the leftmost part of section D are continuous with the
685 other rows shown in Figure 1, and accordingly we have coloured only the third row (green) in
686 this vicinity. Nevertheless, if the indicated order of rows is indeed preserved across the whole of
687 Figure 1, then we would anticipate that NCKX1 (SLC24A1) and NCKX2 (SLC24A2) diverged at
688 the second round of WGD.
689 2.6.2. Molecular phylogeny of NCKXs
690 In addition to jawed vertebrate NCKX1 and NCKX2 sequences, we located eight lamprey
691 sequences (including our four transcripts) and two hagfish transcripts. Only one of the eight
692 lamprey sequences was full length (673 residues), and although two others had at least 80%
693 coverage (571 and 554 residues), the remaining four sequences were short fragments (of 165 to
694 211 residues). We included our hagfish transcript that appeared to be full-length, but we omitted
695 a second approximately half-length hagfish transcript (see Supplementary Table S3), because it
696 was quite divergent and we could not obtain a tree with good bootstrap support when it was
697 included. For the outgroup, we used two lancelet sequences together with human NCKX3,
698 NCKX4 and NCKX5 (Supplementary Figure S10). The multiple sequence alignment for our
699 curated set of NCKXs is presented in Supplementary File 4.
700 When we excluded the outgroup, the molecular phylogeny that we obtained for vertebrate visual
701 NCKX sequences displayed unanimous support for all clades apart from the single hagfish
702 sequences (Supplementary Figure S10). With an outgroup comprising two lancelet sequences,
703 Figure 6A shows that the same topology was obtained for the vertebrate clades, but the levels of
704 support dropped somewhat; the fully-expanded tree is shown in Supplementary Figure S11. In
705 view of the fact that four of the lamprey sequences were short fragments, we regard the level of
706 support as acceptable. The lower The molecular phylogeny that we obtained for visual NCKX
707 sequences from jawed and agnathan vertebrates is presented in Figure 6A in collapsed form; the
708 fully expanded tree is shown in Supplementary Figure S10. Despite the fact that four of the
709 lamprey sequences were short fragments, there is a high level of bootstrap support for the
710 overall topology, as well as for each of the five jawed vertebrate and lamprey clades; only the
711 hagfish sequence is positioned with support lower than 90%. The upper lamprey clade
712 (coloured red) comprised the three longest sequences (>80% coverage) and was placed as sister
713 to jawed vertebrate NCKX2 with 99%unanimous support. The other two lamprey clades
714 (labelled NCKX-X and NCKX-Y) contained the short fragments and were positioned as sisters,
715 and jointly as sister to the NCKX1 and NCKX2 clades.
716 Figure 6. NCKX phylogeny and duplications
20
717 2.6.3. Pattern of duplications and losses for NCKX genes
718 We interpret the phylogeny in Figure 6A to indicate the likelihood that NCKX1 and NCKX2
719 diverged at the second round of WGD, according to the pattern of gene duplications and losses
720 shown in Figure 6B. Thus, an ancestral NCKX1/2 duplicated twice during 2R WGD, without
721 loss of genes after the first round, and with three losses after the second round. Accordingly,
722 this interpretation (based on molecular phylogeny) supports our earlier tentative interpretation
723 that SLC24A1 and SLC24A2 are located on a pair of chromosomal rows that we postulate
724 separated from the other pair at 1R. In other words, these phylogenetic data are consistent with
725 our proposal that the order of rows is maintained across Figure 1, though they cannot be viewed
726 as providing strong support for that hypothesis.
727 For the short-headed lamprey, M. mordax, which possesses LWS as the only visual opsin, Table
728 1 shows that the only NCKX detected was the ‘cone’ isoform NCKX2. For G. australis,
729 comparison of the transcript levels for eyes from juvenile downstream-migrant and adult
730 upstream-migrant animals showed that NCKX2 was found almost exclusively in the
731 downstream migrants (data not shown). Furthermore the other two isoforms, NCKX-X and
732 NCKX-Y which are both expressed only at trace levels, were also found to be downstream-
733 dominant, though to a much lesser extent than NCKX2. The downstream migrants are known to
734 be ‘cone-dominant’, expressing higher levels of LWS, SWS1 and SWS2 opsins and lower levels
735 of Rh1 [8,67,68]. Hence the above findings are consistent with the idea that, in G. australis, the
736 cone-like photoreceptors express only NCKX2, and at moderate levels, and they also suggest
737 that the rod-like photoreceptors may express much lower levels of the other two isoforms.
738 2.6.4. Functional motifs and structure of the NCKX proteins of lampreys
739 It is difficult to form an overall picture of sequence conservation across the set of lamprey
740 NCKX proteins because six of the eight sequences were quite short fragments, of less than half
741 the length of jawed vertebrate NCKX2, and only a single lamprey sequence (G. australis
742 NCKX2) appeared to be full-length. Key functional motifs in the NCKX proteins are two
743 a-repeats that are involved in the binding and transport of Na+, Ca2+, and K+ in NCKX2 [69],
744 and by homology also in NCKX1. These motifs cover the 60 residues 161–220 and 520–579 in
745 human NCKX2, and 481–540 and 958–1017 in human NCKX1 [70]. The region of the first of
746 these repeats is included in the partial sequences of L. camtschaticum (JL4915, JL8985 and
747 JL371), and in the NCKX2 sequences of G. australis (full length) and M. mordax and
748 P. marinus (partial). Across those sequences, there is only a single site that differs (Asp492Glu,
749 for human NCKX1 versus L. camtschaticum JL371). In the second repeat, only the NCKX2
750 sequences of G. australis (full length) and M. mordax and P. marinus (partial) have coverage.
751 Amongst these, there is again only a single site (431) that differs, with the three lamprey
752 sequences possessing Thr and the two human sequences Ser. This analysis shows that the
753 cation-binding/transporting region is very highly conserved.

755 3. Discussion
756 3.1. Paralogon arrangement of phototransduction cascade genes
757 An unanticipated finding of our analysis has been the conclusion that at least 28 (and possiblyas
758 many as 3633) genes encoding proteins directly involved in the vertebrate phototransduction
759 cascade are contained within what may appears to be a single paralogon, as summarised in
760 Figure 7. The first five gene families in Figure 7A (RGS9/11, GNGTs, PDE6<U+03B3>s,
761 recoverin/visinin, and GNB1–4s), comprising ten genes involved in phototransduction, have
762 been extracted from Figure 2, where we were unable to conclusively identify which of the two
763 middle rows should be positioned second and third. Eight of the remaining nine families,
764 comprising 25 genes involved in phototransduction have been extracted from Figure 1; in
765 addition, as explained below, we have also included GNB5. In our view, it is very likely that
766 these 14 families, comprising 36 phototransduction genes, are part of a single paralogon. This
767 expands upon the previous proposal [2,3] that the transducin ß-subunit genes GNB1–GNB4 are
768 all members of a paralogon that includes the visual opsins. In Figure 7, we have split several
769 gene families into two or more columns, on the basis of evidence for duplications prior to 2R
770 WGD. Thus, as noted in [2], the Ensembl gene tree shows genes from protostome and tunicate
771 taxa intervening within GNB1–GNB4 and, likewise, there is evidence that the opsin duplications
772 (apart from Rh1/Rh2) preceded 2R WGD [9]. Finally, we have presented evidence in the
773 present paper for pre-2R duplications within the GC and GCAP/GCIP families. Figure 7A
774 shows 26 of the 28 phototransduction genes (coloured or shaded) from Figure 1, and Figure 7B
775 shows the remaining two (GNB1 and GNB3) plus a further five phototransduction from Figure 2.
776 It appears highly likely that each section of Figure 7 forms a paralogon. In addition, there is
777 overlap between the two regions, with several members of the GNB, SLC2A and CLSTN families
778 appearing in both Figure 1 and Figure 2. Moreover, it has previously been proposed [2,3] that
779 the transducin ß-subunit genes GNB1–GNB4 are all members of the paralogon that includes the
780 visual opsins. If that is indeed the case, then all 33 phototransduction genes in Figure 7 would
781 form part of a single paralogon. In Figure 7B, we have split the GNB genes into two columns
782 because, as also noted in [2], GNB3 probably diverged long before WGD, as the Ensembl gene
783 tree shows genes from protostome and tunicate taxa intervening between it and the other three
784 paralogs.
785 Figure 7. Paralogons summary, showing phototransduction gene families only
786 Although the paralogon summarised in Figure 7 contains a large number of the genes involved
787 in vertebrate phototransduction, there are several genes missing, and we now consider other
788 potential members. Perhaps the most obvious set of missing genes is the trio of PDE6 catalytic
789 subunits (PDE6A/B/C). This family has been shown by Lagman et al to reside in a paralogous
790 region (see Fig. 2 of [7]), and so the question arises as to whether that region might at some
791 stage have been contiguous with the main paralogon. In likely support of this view are the
792 following observations: (a) the genes that they describe in the vicinity of PDE6B (on spotted gar
22
793 LG2/LG4, on human Hsa4, and on chicken Gga4) all correspond to the bottom (orange) row of
794 Figure 1, around the boundary between LG2 and LG4 in spotted gar; and (b) the genes that they
795 describe in the vicinity of PDE6A (on spotted gar LG6 and on human Hsa5) lie at what might be
796 the corresponding position on the top (blue) row of Figure 1; on the other hand, we were not
797 able to find a region of Figure 1 corresponding to PDE6C. If the above relationships were to
798 prove valid, then their positions on the top and bottom rows would indicate that PDE6A and
799 PDE6B had diverged at the first round of 2R WGD. Apart from these genes, the only other
800 phototransduction genes that have not been accounted for in Figures 1 and 2 are the CNGC
801 channel ß-subunit genes (CNGB1/3) and RGS9BP.
802 The probability that so many separate gene families (nine in Figure 1) contributing to a common
803 function would occur in such proximity as a result of random placement is very low. Excluding
804 a few outlier genes, the illustrated regions in Figure 1 encompass no more than ~70 Mb along
805 each of four rows, out of a total length for the spotted gar genome assembly of ~900 Mb, so that
806 each row corresponds to ~31% of the total available length. The probability that these nine gene
807 families would happen to be co-located within such a region by chance can be estimated as 0.318
808 <U+F0BB> 10-4, and we therefore reject the notion that such proximity occurred randomly. Instead, we
809 conclude that prior to 2R WGD, there must have been some advantage in these ancestral genes
810 being close together in the ‘pre-quadruplication’ genome; one such advantage might have
811 involved the ability to regulate gene expression within the phototransduction cascade.
812 Our definition of the 1R/2R branching pattern in Figures 1, 2 and 7A is based on our previous
813 phylogenetic analyses of the GRKs, arrestins and GNAIs [9,10]. Those phylogenies provided
814 high levels of support for the following isoforms being sisters: GRK1A/GRK1B, SAG/ARR3,
815 and GNAI3/GNAI1 (with the last pair also implying GNAT2/GNAT3). On that basis, we
816 conclude that the upper pair of rows (blue and red) diverged from the lower pair of rows (green
817 and orange), with that first divergence having occurred at 1R.
818 That interpretation has a corollary for the identification of the gene duplications within the
819 CGNGA family. Previously [9], we proposed that CNGA1 diverged from (CNGA2, CNGA3) at
820 1R, because the latter two clades were positioned as sisters. However, that pattern does not
821 conform with the row positions of the CNGA genes shown in Figures 1 and 7A. Instead, we
822 suggest that CNGA1 may have diverged prior to WGD, by a local duplication, and that CNGA2
823 and CNGA3 then diverged at 1R. It has previously been established that CNGA4 diverged prior
824 to WGD (and probably prior to the protostome/deuterostome split), and it now seems plausible
825 that CNGA1 also diverged before WGD. In the absence of compelling evidence, though, we
826 have shown the CNGA genes in a single column, rather than placing CNGA1 in a separate
827 column.
828 Of the entire set of genes that encode proteins directly involved in vertebrate phototransduction,
829 the only families that we have been unable to associate with the arrangement in Figure 7 are the
830 genes for the PDE6 catalytic subunits (PDE6A/B/C), the CNGC channel ß-subunits (CNGB1/3),
831 and the transducin <U+03B3>-subunits (GNGT1/2); the last pair have previously been shown to be located
23
832 in a paralogon that appears to be separate [2]. For the first set, it is conceivable that the PDE6
833 genes are displaced members of the paralogon identified in Figure 1, because the spotted gar
834 linkage groups on which they reside (LG6, LG2 and LG5) feature prominently in Figure 1.
835 3.2. Summary of gene duplications that gave rise to Ca-feedback regulation
836 of phototransduction in extant vertebrates
837 In Figure 8 we summarise the pattern of gene duplications (and losses) that we deduce to have
838 given rise to the multiple isoforms in the four families of proteins mediating the Ca-feedback
839 regulation of phototransduction in jawed vertebrates. In addition to the extensive expansion that
840 occurred during 2R WGD, it is clear that prior to 2R WGD there were two successive gene
841 duplications in an ancestral GCAP gene, and likewise two duplications in an ancestral visual GC
842 gene. Within the GCAP family, the latter of these ‘pre-2R’ duplications generated the
843 GCAP1/L/3 and GCAP2/A/B branches, and in the visual GC family the latter of the ‘pre-2R’
844 duplications generated the GC-E and GC-D/GC-F branches.
845 These last two ‘pre-2R’ gene duplications appear to have been instrumental in creating the
846 potential for two different regimes of Ca2+-feedback regulation, one utilising a ‘GCAP1’ with
847 GC-E and the other using a ‘GCAP2’ with a GC-D/GC-F. In the photoreceptors of extant
848 vertebrates, it has been clearly established that such a Ca2+-feedback loop is crucial both to
849 achieving a well-timed recovery of the light response and to mediating light adaptation (the
850 ability to adjust rapidly to a change in operating intensity) [71]. Disruption of this feedback loop
851 leads to a pronounced slowing of the recovery phase of responses to brief flashes, and also to
852 saturation of the response at a much lower intensity of steady light than is normally the
853 casewhen the loop is intact. Rods recover more slowly than cones and they saturate at a much
854 lower intensity than cones do, and while it seems likely that the different properties of the GCAP
855 and GC isoforms expressed in rods and cones contribute to the disparities, these differences have
856 yet to be explained in quantitative terms.
857 Figure 8. Gene duplications summary
858 3.3. The origin of specialisation for operation at high and low intensities
859 In a recent analysis of the evolution of the shut-off steps in phototransduction, we showed that
860 the distinct isoforms of GRK expressed in cones and rods arose in a gene duplication event that
861 occurred prior to 2R WGD, and indeed prior to the divergence of tunicates [10]. In the present
862 paper we show that isoforms of GCAP and isoforms of GC, that are differentially expressed in
863 cones and rods, likewise arose through gene duplications that occurred prior to 2R WGD.
864 Combining these observations, we conclude that multiple isoforms of three of the proteins
865 involved in regulating response recovery and light adaptation already existed prior to the
866 emergence of rhodopsin as a distinct visual opsin during 2R WGD. In addition, as discussed in
867 §3.1, it is possible that separate isoforms of CNGAs also existed prior to 2R WGD. Hence we
868 conclude that the potential for the specialisation of proto-vertebrate photoreceptors for operation
24
869 preferentially in either dim light or bright light existed before rhodopsin evolved. We further
870 hypothesise the existence, prior to 2R WGD, of differential expression of isoforms that enabled
871 such specialisation.
872 Thus, we envisage one class of photoreceptor (very much like extant cones) that expressed
873 GRK7, together with a predominance of GCAP1/L/3 and GC-E, and also possibly with
874 CNGA2/3, that would have functioned well at high light levels. And we envisage another class
875 of photoreceptor expressing GRK1, together with a predominance of GCAP2/A/B and GC-D/F,
876 and also possibly with CNGA1, that would have saturated at moderate intensities and therefore
877 would have functioned preferentially at lower light levels.
878 Consistent with this idea, there has been a very recent report [72] that pinopsin evolved as the
879 ancestral dim-light visual opsin, with a lower rate of thermal activation than cone opsins.
880 Accordingly, it would seem likely that the ancestral low-light photoreceptor that we proposed
881 above would have expressed pinopsin as its visual pigment. It is conceivable that these two
882 hypothetical classes of proto-vertebrate photoreceptor might originally have utilised a common
883 visual opsin (or opsins). Subsequently, when rhodopsin evolved, with its very low rate of
884 thermal isomerisation and intrinsically slower shut-off, it would have been advantageous to the
885 organism for this new visual opsin to be expressed in the ‘scotopic’ photoreceptors that we
886 postulate already existed, thereby facilitating operation at even lower intensities than had
887 previously been possible.
888 We suggest that the original impetus for a duplex arrangement of this kind may have involved
889 the speed of the photoresponse, and in particular the speed of detection of a reduction in light
890 intensity. When the molecular steps that mediate response recovery first evolved, it would seem
891 likely that they would have been sluggish, either because the enzymatic efficacy of the reactions
892 had not yet been optimised, or because the levels of protein expression were low. And, because
893 the efficacy of these shut-off steps sets the speed for detection of a drop in light intensity, it
894 seems likely that there would have been selective pressure to accelerate those steps, and thereby
895 provide more rapid detection of (for example) the shadow of a predator. However, an inevitable
896 trade-off with faster shut-off steps would have been a reduced ability to detect the onset of a dim
897 light. Hence, there might well have been a major advantage in separating the two functions, by
898 utilising one class of photoreceptor with faster shut-off reactions for the rapid detection of a drop
899 in intensity at moderate light levels, and another class of photoreceptor with slower shut-off
900 reactions for detection tasks at lower light levels. Pressures of this kind would have been
901 present long before 2R WGD, and so it is perfectly natural to think that a duplex arrangement of
902 retinal photoreceptors might have evolved long before the emergence of rhodopsin as a
903 specialised scotopic visual pigment.
904 3.4. Issues with gene naming and annotation
905 As an example of the issues associated with gene naming and annotation for the multiple
906 isoforms of phototransduction genes, we will examine the situation for the visual guanylyl
25
907 cyclase genes in zebrafish. Inspection of the phylogeny in Supplementary Figure S7 shows that
908 for each of the three clades (GC-E, GC-D and GC-F) only a single 3R duplicate has been
909 retained in zebrafish, and this simplifies the identification of gene orthology. The assignment
910 that can be seen in Supplementary Figure S7, of zebrafish isoforms to the three clades, is set out
911 in Table 3. Of the three zebrafish gene names in ZFIN, only gc2 is orthologous with the
912 corresponding name used in mammals, in this case RetGC-2 = GC-F. Zebrafish gc3 (zatoichi) is
913 orthologous with GC-E = RetGC-1, while zebrafish gucy2f is orthologous with GC-D, which is
914 commonly referred to as the olfactory GC.
915 Table 3. Zebrafish GC genes
916 Thus, we concur with Collery & Kennedy [73] that gc3 corresponds to human GUCY2D =
917 GC-E. But we reject the contention of Stiebel-Kalish et al [74] that the zebrafish gene gucy2f on
918 chromosome 15 is the ortholog of human GUCY2D; instead, it is the ortholog of GC-D, the
919 ‘olfactory’ GC in mammals, which is expressed in the retina of many aquatic species, but which
920 has been lost from human. Nor can we concur with the claim of Rätscho et al [24] that all three
921 of gc2, gc3 and gucy2f show the highest degree of relationship to mammalian GC-F.
922 3.5. Significance and future directions
923 Overall, we regard our analyses as significant in the following ways. Firstly, we have
924 discovered that the great majority of vertebrate phototransduction genes are located within a
925 single paralogon. Secondly, we have elucidated the gene duplication patterns for the multiple
926 families of genes that mediate the crucial Ca-feedback loop of phototransduction, identifying
927 several duplications prior to, and multiple duplications during, 2R WGD. Thirdly, by examining
928 the pre-2R duplications, we have found evidence for the likely existence of a duplex
929 photopic/scotopic specialisation in a proto-vertebrate organism before the two rounds of whole
930 genome duplication, and hence prior to the emergence of rhodopsin. Fourthly, inspection of our
931 phylogenetic clades has identified, more clearly than previously, those isoforms that have been
932 lost in different lineages (e.g. the loss of visinin from mammals and cartilaginous fish, and the
933 loss of recoverin from sauropsids). Fifthly, such inspection has also identified a substantial
934 number of misleading and/or erroneous annotations in the published sequence databases (e.g. in
935 NCBI, ZFIN and Ensembl); accordingly, the annotation of purported rod/cone isoforms in
936 existing databases should be treated with considerable caution.
937 For the future, we suggest that it will be important to confirm the positions of the sections of
938 rows in Figures 1, 2 and 7 that we have not been able to assign with certainty; this may be
939 possible through examination of synteny in additional species, and by more extensive
940 examination of the regions adjacent to each of the relevant gene families. It will also be
941 important to investigate more comprehensively whether any of the few other genes that play a
942 role in vertebrate phototransduction may additionally be associated with the ‘phototransduction
943 paralogon’. In addition, we suggest that effort should be devoted to tabulating a revised set of
944 names and descriptions for the genes encoding the multiple isoforms of phototransduction
26
945 proteins in different species. And now that an assembly for the genome of the inshore hagfish
946 (E. burgeri) is included in Ensembl, we suggest that it may be possible to obtain improved
947 phylogenies for all agnathan clades, for which a considerable limitation has until now stemmed
948 from the occurrence of ‘single taxon clades’, because in most cases we had transcripts for only a
949 single species of hagfish, E. cirrhatus.
950
951 4. Methods
952 4.1 Analysis of gene synteny
953 We searched for paralogous gene regions, primarily from the genome of spotted gar
954 (Lepisosteus oculatis), using a combination of Ensembl (www.ensembl.org), Genomicus
955 (www.genomicus.biologie.ens.fr), and Synteny Database (syntenydb.uoregon.edu/synteny_db).
956 Once we had located potentially interesting genes in the vicinity of phototransduction genes, we
957 examined paralogs using Ensembl’s gene tree with viewing option ‘View paralogs of current
958 gene’. In order for a set of genes to be considered ‘2R paralogous’, we required that the
959 Ensembl gene tree not show any invertebrate taxa (e.g. protostome or basal deuterostome
960 species) within the set. For the sets of non-phototransduction genes in Figure 1, we have
961 illustrated only those for which we found at least three paralogs (with the exception of
962 KNCV2/L). In addition, we have aimed to use only gene families that are reasonably close to a
963 phototransduction gene family. Thus, 80% of the sets of non-phototransduction genes (43 of 54
964 sets) have at least one member within 1.7 Mb of a phototransduction gene in spotted gar, and
965 that only two sets exceed a separation of 10 MB (DAPK at 11.2 Mb, and C2CD4 at 10.1 Mb).
966 In assigning continuity of the rows shown in bold and coloured (blue, red, green and orange) in
967 Figure 1, we examined the locations of orthologs across three taxa (spotted gar, human, and
968 chicken), as tabulated in Supplementary Table S1. Where breaks occurred, we looked for signs
969 of synteny across taxa. Our rationale for choice of rows included the following considerations:
970 (1) Across the top row, the blue regions are located on LG14 and LG5 in spotted gar,
971 and where orthologs occur in human the great majority (22 of 26) are located on
972 chromosome 3.
973 (2) Across the second row, the red regions are located on LG7 and LG1 in spotted gar,
974 and of the 27 orthologs found in human all but one are located on the X chromosome.
975 (3) Across the third row, the green regions are located on LG17 and LG3 in spotted gar,
976 and in chicken all 27 orthologs of genes in sections A, B and C are located on
977 chromosome 1, all 9 orthologs for row D are located on chromosome 10, and all 16
978 orthologs for rows E and F are located on chromosome 26.
979 (4) Across the fourth row, the orange regions are located on LG2 and LG8 in spotted
980 gar, while in human five orthologs and eight orthologs, respectively, from these linkage
981 groups are located close together on chromosome 7.

982 Finally, we were not able to find any swapping of regions, from the rows illustrated in Figure 1,
983 that provided a more plausible arrangement for the outcome of a presumed quadruplication
984 followed by a limited degree of rearrangement.
985 4.2 Transcriptome data
986 The methods for obtaining the eye transcriptomes from basal vertebrate species were described
987 in [8], and here we use transcripts from that work. Sequences were available for each of the
988 following species obtained from Australian waters: Eptatretus cirrhatus, broad-gilled hagfish;
989 Geotria australis, pouched lamprey; Mordacia mordax, short-headed lamprey; Aptychotrema
990 vincentiana, western ray; Aptychotrema rostrata, eastern ray; Neotrygon kuhlii (N. australiae),
991 bluespot ray; Chiloscyllium punctatum, bamboo shark; and Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, reef
992 shark. Sequences were also obtained from bowfin, Amia calva, and Florida gar, Lepisosteus
993 platyrhincus. Searching of our transcriptomes was performed using a custom program,
994 TriPyGDU [8], and augmented using a Blast server, SequenceServer [75]. Here we report 73
995 new sequences, which have been submitted to GenBank and assigned nucleotide accession
996 numbers MH577347–MH577419.
997 4.32 Sequence selection
998 We tried to use as uniform a set of taxa as possible, aiming to select: two placental mammals
999 (human and cattle); two marsupials; three birds; three reptiles; two amphibians; bowfin and gar;
1000 two sharks, two rays, and elephant shark (a chimaera). For eastern and western ray, the
1001 orthologous sequences were identical (or nearly so) when we had both, and in those cases we
1002 used only the western ray sequence. Likewise, for the two species of gar, we used only the
1003 Florida gar sequence when we had nearly-identical orthologs. For agnathan vertebrates, we used
1004 every available sequence, except for those partial sequences that we deemed to be too short. For
1005 several partial sequences, we noticed a deterioration of the alignment near the end of the
1006 sequence. In these cases, we removed the poorly-aligned terminal residues; these sequences are
1007 listed as ‘-Trimmed’ in the Figures. For outgroups, we searched for closely similar sequences
1008 from tunicates (Ciona intenstinalis and C. savigni), lancelets (Branchiostoma floridae and
1009 B. belcheri), and from two other more basal deuterostomes (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, an
1010 echinoderm, and Saccoglossus kowalevskii, a hemichordate).
1011 4.43 Multiple sequence alignment
1012 We performed multiple sequence alignment of protein sequences using SATé-II (version 2.2.7,
1013 [76]). For the illustrated phylogenies we standardised on the following settings: aligner,
1014 MAFFT; merger, MUSCLE; tree estimator, FASTTREE; model, WAG+G20; decomposition,
1015 centroid; maximum sub-problem size, 12. To avoid introducing bias, we did not manually
1016 adjust any alignments, and we always used the entire alignment. For the NCKX sequences, we
1017 encountered a problem in that the alignment appeared to vary greatly in response to small
1018 changes (such as omission of a single sequence, or even minor trimming of a sequence); in this
28
1019 case we found that using ClustalW as the aligner in SATé-II gave what appeared to be a better
1020 alignment and a tree that exhibited high support. The alignments we obtained are presented in
1021 Supplementary Files 1–4.
1022 4.54 Tree inference
1023 We constructed unconstrained maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees using IQ-Tree
1024 (Windows multicore version 1.5.6, [77]), using the ultrafast bootstrap approximation [78]. For
1025 the phylogenies presented, we standardised on the following settings: 10,000 bootstrap
1026 replicates; protein substitution model, WAG [79]. We generally obtained very similar results
1027 using the LG substitution model [80], but these are not illustrated. Numbers at each node
1028 represent percentage bootstrap support.
1029 Constrained trees were constructed using the ‘-g’ constraint option in IQ-Tree. In specifying the
1030 constraints, we used the minimum set of sequences that would constrain the tree as we intended.
1031 Typically, we used just a single sequence representative of the relevant isoform, and we relied
1032 on the tightness of clading to constrain the other orthologs in the same manner. Each constraint
1033 tree that we used is shown as an inset by the constrained tree. One point to bear in mind when
1034 examining constrained trees is that the level of bootstrap support at any node that has been
1035 constrained is necessarily (i.e. artificially) increased, in many cases to 100%, because of the
1036 constraint.
1037 For each constrained tree obtained, we conducted tree topology tests using the ‘-z’ option in IQ-
1038 Tree, in order to test whether or not the constrained tree needed to be rejected in comparison
1039 with the unconstrained ML tree. The tests applied were bp-RELL, c-ELW and p-AU,
1040 representing respectively: the Bootstrap Proportion test using the RELL method [81], the
1041 Expected Likelihood Weight test [82], and the Approximately Unbiased test [83]. Only those
1042 trees that passed all tests at the 95% confidence level (i.e. p = 0.05) were considered further.
1043 4.65 Molecular modelling
1044 The structure of proteins was predicted using SWISS MODEL (swissmodel.expasy.org [84]).
1045 Protein sequences were used to search for appropriate templates; the same template was then
1046 used for each sequence in the class. The N-terminal myristoylation of proteins was predicted by
1047 the Myristoylator program (web.expasy.org/myristoylator). The program uses ensembles of
1048 neural networks to learn to discriminate positive and negative sequences for myristoylation.

Notes for Table 2:
Residues are shown for positions 1–12 in the loop region of EF-hands 1–4 for selected sequences that include all those we have for
agnathan species.
Members of the recoverin/visinin clades are shown above, and members of the GCAP/GCIP clades are shown below.
Residues are shown in bold and coloured at positions 1, 3, 5 and 12 for those cases where the EF-hand is predicted to bind Ca2+.
The requirements for Ca2+ binding are that the residues at these positions should be: D, (D or N), (D or N or S), and E, respectively.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Syntenic arrangement of 62 families of genes located in the neighbourhood of
phototransduction genes. The 28 genes involved in phototransduction (including 9 that
participate in Ca-feedback regulation) are shown either coloured or shaded. Red indicates
preferential expression in cones; blue, preferential expression in rods; grey, expression in rods
and cones; for the visual opsins, the colours instead provide an indication of spectral sensitivity.
The rows represent spotted gar linkage groups (chromosomes) and the adjacent numbers identify
the individual linkage groups; thus, ‘14’ indicates LG14. The diagram has arbitrarily been
divided into four six sections (A–F), and where a linkage group continues across a section break
this is indicated by an arrow at the end of one section and at the start of the next. The number
below each gene identifier gives the gene location on the spotted gar linkage group in Mb. The
order of gene families is arbitrary, although as far as possible we have arranged them in locally
increasing or decreasing order of gene position in Mb on LG3/LG17 (green row). The diagram
attempts to provide a coherent picture of the likely continuity of the four paralogous
chromosomal regions in the ancestral post-2R genome. However, there is inevitable uncertainty
at each break in linkage group coverage. To address this, our illustrated arrangement
additionally takes into account the chromosomal locations of genes in human and chicken, as
tabulated in Supplementary Table S1. For those regions where we feel reasonably confident of
the continuity of each postulated ancestral chromosome we have used thicker coloured lines; for
regions where we are less confident the lines are thinner and grey. Genes with a diagonal strike-
through are missing from the spotted gar genome, and their presumed locations have been
derived from human and/or chicken. In section E, the dotted arrow links the postulated ancestral
location of GCAP3 (GUCA1C) to its current location in spotted gar (see Text). The branching
patterns sketched at the bottom right represents the order of 1R and 2R duplications deduced
recently for the GRKs and arrestins [10], and for the GNAIs/GNATs [9].
Figure 2. Syntenic arrangement of genes neighbouring recoverin and visinin. Top four rows
are spotted gar linkage groups that appear to form a 2R paralogon. The genes at the top right
(grey background) also appear in Figure 1, and this provides the basis for colouring the top row
blue and the fourth row orange; the second and third rows have been coloured red and green,
respectively, for reasons described in the text, but this identification is not secure. As the
genome assembly for spotted gar does not contain visinin, we also included genes from the
unplaced scaffolds GL343279.1 and GL343329.1 of green anole, and GL172639.1, GL173179.1
and GL172759.1 of Xenopus; these are shown as the middle next two rows. For spotted gar, two
three of the illustrated genes are on unplaced scaffolds (JH); RCVRN has and RGS9 have been
placed on LG10/LG2 by comparison with mammalian genomes (data not showne.g. opossum, in
bottom row), and TTYH1 has been placed on LG26 by comparison with anole. Lowermost Next
four rows are for zebrafish, and show genes on chromosomes ZF3/ZF12 and ZF16/ZF19, that
include the 3R copies of recoverin and visinin. Bottom row is for opossum chromosome 2, and
is presented as evidence supporting continuity of the orange row LG10/LG2 for spotted gar.
Shading indicates homologous regions around visinin (yellow) and recoverin (cyan). Bold
35
outline denotes phototransduction genes, with colour coding as in Figure 1. Solid and
dashedDashed and dotted lines at left link the rows for visinin and recoverin, respectively; open
circles denote 3R duplications in zebrafish. Note that the genes we designate as VISININ-A and
VISININ-B are named RCVRN2 and RCVRN3 in Ensembl and NCBI; we have also made some
minor changes to a few other gene names to aid comparison across the three species and for the
avoidance of confusion. The locations of PDE6H and PDE6I in spotted gar have been obtained
from [7].

Figure 3. Molecular phylogeny and proposed gene duplications and losses for recoverin and
visinin. A. Constrained molecular phylogeny for recoverin and visinin sequences from jawed
and agnathan vertebrates, in collapsed form. The fully-expanded tree is shown in
Supplementary Figure S2; identical topology was obtained using the WAG and LG substitution
models. The two dashed arrows show the positions obtained for the root of the unconstrained
tree, with the WAG model (upper lower arrow) and the LG model (lower upper arrow). The
constraint tree that was applied is shown below the main panel; by constraining just two jawed
vertebrate sequences and two agnathan sequences, the support level became unanimous for each
of the five sub-trees. B. Proposed scenario for gene duplications and losses. The only losses are
presumed to have occurred following agnathan-jawed (A-J) speciation. Although this the
pattern with visinin shown with a dashed arrow has the highest level of support, we could not
rule out the possibility that visinin is instead sister to one or other of the two agnathan
sequences, as shown by the dotted arrows (see Text).
Figure 4. Molecular phylogeny and proposed gene duplications and losses for jawed vertebrate
GCAPs. A. Unconstrained molecular phylogeny for GCAP sequences from jawed vertebrates,
in collapsed form; the fully-expanded tree is shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Support for
the two main sub-trees, 1/3/L and 2/A/B, is unanimous, and support for each individual clade
except one is at least 96%; GCAP1-L is supported at 85%. GCAP3 and GCIP are coloured red,
as they are thought to be expressed only in cones. B. Proposed scenario for gene duplications
and losses. We invoke two duplications prior to WGD: a neuronal calcium sensor (NCS)
duplicated to form GCIP and the ancestral GCAP, and then that GCAP duplicated to form what
would become the 1/3/L and 2/A/B families. Subsequent duplications and losses occurred at 1R
and 2R as indicated. The bottom panel shows the corresponding scenario for the positions of
genes on blocks at the indicated times.
Figure 5. Molecular phylogeny and proposed gene duplications and losses for vertebrate visual
guanylyl cyclases. A. Unconstrained molecular phylogeny for GC sequences from jawed and
agnathan vertebrates, in collapsed form. For an unconstrained tree, the level of support at every
node is remarkably high. The fully-expanded tree is shown in Supplementary Figure S7, and in
addition a tree with the single hagfish sequence constrained to clade with the GC-Es is given in
Supplementary Figure S8. GC-E (=Ret-GC1) is encoded by GUCY2D in human; GC-F
(=Ret-GC2) is encoded by GUCY2F; GC-D is often referred to as ‘olfactory’, yet it is expressed
36
in the retina in a number of aquatic taxa. B. Proposed scenario for gene duplications and losses.
We invoke two duplications prior to WGD. Following the duplication of an ancestral visual GC,
one of the genes has been retained only in lampreys. The other duplicated to form GC-E plus
the forerunner of GC-D and GC-F. The subsequent duplications during 2R WGD were
followed by multiple losses.
Figure 6. Molecular phylogeny and proposed gene duplications and losses for vertebrate visual
NCKX genes. A. Unconstrained molecular phylogeny for visual NCKX sequences from jawed
vertebrates and lampreys, in collapsed form; the fully-expanded tree is presented in
Supplementary Figure S11. Alignment SATé with ClustalW (see Methods). The dotted arrow
shows the position of the outgroup in the unconstrained tree, which differs by one node from the
constrained case. This constraint caused only a very small change in log likelihood, of <U+2206>LogL <
1; the constraint tree used is shown in the inset below the main tree. Lampreys possess three
visual NCKX genes, one of which is the ortholog of jawed vertebrate NCKX2. B. Proposed
scenario for gene duplications and losses. The ancestral NCKX1/2 gene duplicated at 1R, and
then at 2R one of these duplicated to form NCKX1 and NCKX2, whereas the other duplicated to
form NCKX-X and NCKX-Y which have been lost in jawed vertebrates.
Figure 7. Summary of proposed ancestral arrangement of vertebrate phototransduction gene
families. The two sectionsgenes are taken from Figures 1 and 2 after omission of families not
involved in phototransduction. For section A, We deduced the 1R/2R branching pattern from
the combined phylogenies for the families, placing particular weight on the GRKs, arrestins, and
GNAIs/GNATs. For the first three families in section AB, we cannot assign the positions of the
two middle rows, and they may correspond to either the red or the green row in A. The genes
shown in white boxes indicate paralogs that are not used in retinal photoreceptors, though
GNAT3 is used in parietal photoreceptors.
