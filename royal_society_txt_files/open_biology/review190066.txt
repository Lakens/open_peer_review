The structures of the F-type ATP synthases have proven to be more diverse that would have been
anticipated by most, if not all, investigators. Perhaps even more unexpected has been the notion
that this conserved enzyme may, on account of the species-specific structural difference, be a
drug target .In addition, understanding the complexities of conformational changes and modes of
inhibition by endogenous inhibitors can be enhanced by collecting multiple structures. It is in this
context that this paper should be seen. It is scientifically a high standard contribution and the
discussion of comparative points has to be presented even if it does become a major theme. A few
minor points.
1. If read quickly line 65 can be taken to mean that ATP hydrolysis drives the flagella - ..
hydolysing ATP to generate........, or , in motile bacteria, to drive....
2. Is there any reference to 'vary over a wide range' (line 68)?
3. line 112 - this reviewer thought that thermostability is not so easy in general terms to
understand as hoped in 1983 when ref 40 was written. Not a very important point here but could
more recent references be given as well?
4. line 97 is there no delta subunit?

This manuscript characterizes the F1-ATPase from the pathogenic anaerobic bacterium F.
nucleatum. The authors have done an excellent job of examining the catalytic activity of the
enzyme by ensemble measurements as well as the structure determined by protein
crystallography. Characterization of the structure and function of this protein complex may
enable the design of new drugs against this pathogen. The work is important and will attract a
broad readership.
During Lines 205 to 234, the authors discuss possible relationships between several F1-ATPase
structures from bovine mitochondria to the rotary mechanism of this molecular motor as revealed
by single-molecule rotation experiments. This is an important part of the manuscript that
certainly increases the relevance of the work presented. However, the statements between lines
216 and 225 require a more thorough discussion and an adequate response to the queries below
before the manuscript is suitable for publication:
1. A figure that shows the rotational alignment of the gamma and beta-empty subunits of the
structures discussed is needed to increase confidence in the conclusions. These figures could be
included in supplementary information. The authors claim structures 1H8E and 4YXW differ in
rotation by 105 degrees, and conclude that these structures represent the ATP-binding dwell and
the Phosphate release dwell. Aligning structures 4YXW and 4ASU would be of value to support
their conclusion that the latter represents the catalytic dwell.
2. The 1H8E structure contains bound Mg-ADP-fluoroaluminate, which is a well-known
transition state inhibitor of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. The authors must explain why this
structure is not a good fit for the rotary position of the catalytic dwell when ATP hydrolysis
occurs.
3. Although the structures show differences in rotational position in the globular domain of
subunit gamma, the other end of this subunit has not rotated in any of the structures discussed
due to a cluster of electrostatic interactions that exists between the “catch loop” of the empty beta
subunit and subunit gamma. Greene and Frasch (2003) showed that mutating these highly
conserved residues dramatically reduces catalytic function. The authors need to explain how
their conclusions of rotary positions fit with the catch loop/gamma subunit electrostatic
interactions.
4. The authors need to state the reasons why their structure/rotary position assignments are
preferred to those reported by Suzuki et al. (2014) Nature Chem Biol, who originally
characterized the rotary dwell positions of human F1-ATPase.
5. The authors also need to discuss why their structural assignment of 4ASU as the catalytic dwell
is a better fit to available data than that of Nam, Pu and Karplus (2014) who concluded that 4ASU
closely resembled the rotary position of the ATP-binding dwell.
6. Immediately after the discussion to relate bovine structures to rotary positions, lines 226 to 234
4
discusses the gamma subunit rotary positions of bacteria. For clarity the authors should state that
single-molecule studies of G. stearothermophilus and E. coli F1 showed that Pi release occurs at
the end of the catalytic dwell (Watanabe et al. (2010) Nature Chem Biol) and ADP release occurs
about 25 degrees before the catalytic dwell (Martin et al. (2014) PNAS). These are approximately
at the same rotary positions as human
Suzuki et al. (2014) Nature Chem Biol, but in reverse order.
7. As a minor point, it would be helpful to readers if the authors included the PDB reference
numbers in the text when comparing so many different structures.

Appendix A
Manuscript RSOB-19-0066 by Petri et al.
We are grateful to the referees for their helpful comments. In the modified manuscript changes
requested by the referees have been highlighted in yellow and we have responded to the points
that they raise as follows.
Referee 1
1. If read quickly line 65 can be taken to mean that ATP hydrolysis drives the flagella - ..
hydrolysing ATP to generate........, or , in motile bacteria, to drive....
In the revised manuscript, the sentence has been modified so as to avoid any possible
ambiguity.
2. Is there any reference to 'vary over a wide range' (line 68)?
A reference has been provided; Dimroth & Cook, Adv Microb Physiol, 2004 see reference 4 in
the revised list.
3. line 112 - this reviewer thought that thermostability is not so easy in general terms to
understand as hoped in 1983 when ref 40 was written. Not a very important point here
but could more recent references be given as well?
The general explanation of the basis for thermostabilization of proteins has not changed since
the early 1980s. Proteins become thermostabilized by having additional energy in their
structures, provided in many different ways: additional salt bridges, increased hydrophobic
interactions, additional S-S bridges and so forth. They can also smooth off their external surface
to prevent ingress of water molecules. We have provided an additional and more recent
reference to the topic as requested; Kumar, Tsai & Nussinov, Prot eng, 2000.
4. line 97 is there no delta subunit?
There was no d-subunit in the complex that was studied. This is now stated explicitly on line
98.

Referee 2
1. A figure that shows the rotational alignment of the gamma and beta-empty subunits of
the structures discussed is needed to increase confidence in the conclusions. These figures
could be included in supplementary information. The authors claim structures 1h8e and
4yxw differ in rotation by 105 degrees, and conclude that these structures represent the
ATP-binding dwell and the Phosphate release dwell. Aligning structures 4yxw and 4asu
would be of value to support their conclusion that the latter represents the catalytic dwell.
First, as requested by the referee, a new figure (Figure S8) showing <U+03B3>- and ßE-subunits in
several superimposed structures has been added to document the rotary positions of <U+03B3>-subunits
at catalytic and phosphate release dwells. This Figure needs to be considered with information
already provided in Table S4 where the measured rotations of <U+03B3>-subunits are summarized.
Second, in the revised manuscript, we have also elaborated and explained explicitly in the text
why the structure inhibited with thiophosphate (and rotationally similar structures without
thiophosphate, eg the bovine high resolution ground state structure, 2jdi) represent the
phosphate release dwell, and why structures inhibited by IF1, eg 2v7q (and rotationally similar
structures without IF1, eg the phosphonate structure, 4asu) represent the catalytic dwell. All of
these points have been published already (see Suzuki et al, Nat Chem Biol, 2014, Bason et al,
PNAS, 2015), and the references were provided in the original manuscript, and additionally the
points were summarized in Table S4. Third, we do not, as the referee asserts, conclude that the
1h8e structure is the ATP binding dwell, but we state clearly that it is possible that it could be,
as it lies at a unique rotary position compared to all other structures and that position
corresponds to neither phosphate release nor catalytic dwell.
2. The 1h8e structure contains bound Mg-ADP-fluoroaluminate, which is a well-known
transition state inhibitor of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. The authors must explain why
this structure is not a good fit for the rotary position of the catalytic dwell when ATP
hydrolysis occurs.
First, Mg-ADP-fluoroaluminate is not a transition state inhibitor in ATP hydrolysis, it is a
transition state analogue. Second, to repeat points made in response 1, in this structure, 1h8e,
the <U+03B3>-subunit is at a unique rotary position 15° ahead of the phosphate release dwell, and 45°
before the position that we have identified as the catalytic dwell. This had already been
documented in the original manuscript in Table S4. In addition, in the new Figure S8 where
the various structures of <U+03B3>- and associated ßE-subunits are superimposed, the unique rotational
position of the <U+03B3>- subunit in 1h8e is shown.
2
3. Although the structures show differences in rotational position in the globular domain
of subunit gamma, the other end of this subunit has not rotated in any of the structures
discussed due to a cluster of electrostatic interactions that exists between the “catch loop”
of the empty beta subunit and subunit gamma. Greene and Frasch (2003) showed that
mutating these highly conserved residues dramatically reduces catalytic function. The
authors need to explain how their conclusions of rotary positions fit with the catch
loop/gamma subunit electrostatic interactions.
All of our conclusions fit with the “catch” loop feature, and there is nothing to explain. We
agree with the referee that above the “catch” loop all of the structures of <U+03B3>-subunits superimpose
and are essentially identical, and that it is below the “catch” loop that differences in the
rotational states of <U+03B3>-subunits are found. In the revised manuscript, we have provided a new
Figure S7 to illustrate this point, and we have introduced the point into the text of the paper.
The catch holds the <U+03B3>-subunit to allow torsional energy to be stored somewhere below the catch,
which once a critical point is reached releases the energy in a quantised manner to generate the
rotational step or sub-step. The observed rotational dwells represented by the structures are
presumably fixed stably by other as yet unidentified subtle changes in the structures of a- and
ß-subunits. At our current level of understanding, it is not possible to provide a more precise
explanation as the information is not available.
4. The authors need to state the reasons why their structure/rotary position assignments
are preferred to those reported by Suzuki et al. (2014) Nature Chem Biol, who originally
characterized the rotary dwell positions of human F1-ATPase.
The numbers are arbitrary. As we are perfectly entitled to do, we set our highest resolution
structure as the zero point and compared all other structures to it (this is a higher resolution
version of the so-called “ground state” which was the first structure of an F1-ATPase to be
described). We have used these numbers in previously published papers without any adverse
comments being made, and for the sake of consistency we prefer to continue to do so. In Fig.
6 of their paper, Suzuki et al show our structures on their rotary scale.
5. The authors also need to discuss why their structural assignment of 4asu as the catalytic
dwell is a better fit to available data than that of Nam, Pu and Karplus (2014) who
concluded that 4asu closely resembled the rotary position of the ATP-binding dwell.
3
The reasons for the assignment of 4asu as the catalytic dwell have been given above. Crucially,
it should be noted that this assignment is based on two sets of complementary experimental
data, our structures and the measured rotations of the <U+03B3>-subunit, and “single molecule”
experiments by Suzuki et al where rotary angles of the <U+03B3>-subunit have been determined. The
proposals of Nam et al are not based on experimental data but on simulations. Their claim that
4asu is at the ATP binding dwell is incorrect (the reasons have been given above), and, in
addition, an inspection of Fig. S2B in the supplementary section of their paper shows that,
contrary to what is stated in the paper, there are very significant structural differences between
the positions of the ßDP-subunit and the <U+03B3>-subunit based on their calculations and their positions
in 4asu, resulting in steric clashes. They also assert that 1bmf represents the catalytic dwell
whereas it clearly represents the phosphate release dwell; Suzuki et al demonstrated that IF1
stopped rotation at the catalytic dwell. In the revised manuscript, we have added a comment
saying that the conclusions based on the combination of determined structures and rotation
experiments show that the proposals in Nam et al. are incorrect.
6. Immediately after the discussion to relate bovine structures to rotary positions, lines
226 to 234 discusses the gamma subunit rotary positions of bacteria. For clarity the
authors should state that single-molecule studies of G. stearothermophilus and E. coli F1
showed that Pi release occurs at the end of the catalytic dwell (Watanabe et al. (2010)
Nature Chem Biol) and ADP release occurs about 25 degrees before the catalytic dwell
(Martin et al. (2014) PNAS). These are approximately at the same rotary positions as
human Suzuki et al. (2014) Nature Chem Biol, but in reverse order.
Our failure to mention these observations in the original manuscript was a significant, albeit
unintentional, omission. We thank the referee for pointing it out. In the revised manuscript, the
observations have been mentioned and appropriate references have been included
7. As a minor point, it would be helpful to readers if the authors included the PDB
reference numbers in the text when comparing so many different structures.
PDB references have been added throughout the text.
