Comments to the Author
label_comment_1
The manuscript by Knickmeyer and colleagues addresses the molecular mechanisms involved in
promoting a poorly understood morphogenetic process, optic fissure fusion. With their work
they identify TGFbeta as a critical player in this process, and put forward a model by which
TGFbeta would induce the expression of Bmp antagonists in the optic fissure. This would protect
the optic fissure from Bmp activity and would allow TGFbeta to promote ECM remodelling and
fissure fusion.
Although the model proposed by the authors is very attractive, the studies performed by the
authors are not enough to confer strength to this study, and further experiments should be
pursued. I find particularly important to do more analysis in conditions of loss of TGFbeta
activity. These comments are further elaborated below.
- The authors show that TGFbeta/GDNF mouse double mutants have a persistent optic
fissure. They attribute this phenotype solely to TGFbeta since GDNF single mutants have not
been reported to have and eye phenotype. They go on to analyse the transcriptional profile of
these double mutants as compared to wild types, and attribute the changes seen to TGFbeta
function. I am not convinced that this inference can be done without further controls.
Transcriptomic analyses are very sensitive and changes may be detected that do not translate in
phenotypic outcomes. Moreover, some changes may be compensated by others and thus result in
no defective phenotype. The authors should be cautious about this approach. The best way of
doing this would be to compare TGFbeta single mutants with wild types, or else add as a further
control to their set of data those from GDNF single mutants (which should be like wild types to
support the authors’ claim).
- Following up from my previous comment, some of the downregulated genes should be
validated by in situ. This could be done in mouse embryos or in zebrafish embryos. To my
understanding, no loss of TGFbeta function condition has been assessed in the study to test the
expression of some of the genes putatively regulated by TGFbeta activity. I find of particular
importance to test the expression of the Bmp antagonists in loss of TGFbeta conditions, since they
are an integral component of the model put forward by the authors. This could easily be done in
the drug treatments with SIS3. A phenotypic analysis of TGFbeta loss of function conditions to
assess the integrity of the ECM in the optic fissure should also be done.
- Regarding the drug treatments with SIS3, the phenotype shown is extremely severe, and
the authors should be cautious to attribute the optic fissure defect to a problem in fusion-indeed,
3
the eye, and the whole head, seems quite affected, and the edema phenotype suggests blood
circulation defects that could indirectly affect fissure closure. Have the authors tried to do
treatments more narrowed down in time? I would recommend doing a series of treatments (in
several time windows and shorter treatments), so that they identify a condition that does not
induce such strong morphological defects in the whole embryo for further analysis of the eye
phenotype.
- The cadherin6 results provide suggestive information but the authors do not seem to
take this beyond a preliminary stage. Again, the authors do not show whether cadherin6
expression is affected in embryos devoid of TGFbeta activity. The cdh6 morpholino phenotypes
are very severe and the embryos seem delayed, and thus the claim of a requirement for optic
fissure closure should be taken with caution. Ideally, local inactivation of cdh6 should be
attempted to show a specific requirement in the optic fissure.
- In addtion, it seems unclear to me what would be the mechanism by which loss of
cadherin6 would lead to coloboma. Would it be the inability of cells at both sides of the fissure to
establish new contacts? How would this relate to defects in ECM remodelling?

Comments to the Author
label_comment_2
In this manuscript, the authors explore the roles of TGF-beta signaling, BMP signaling, and
cadherin-6 in optic fissure fusion in mouse and zebrafish. A microarray experiment is carried out
4
on TGF-beta/GDNF double mutant mouse eyes to identify transcripts of potential relevance to
mutant phenotypes, including optic fissure fusion. Based on the genes identified and ubiquitous
BMP4 overexpression, the authors propose a model in which TGF-beta promotes optic fissure
fusion in a manner that is dependent upon local expression of BMP antagonists. There are also
some experiments carried out related to a potential role for cadherin-6 in optic fissure fusion and
its regulation by BMP.
While there are some potentially interesting and novel data here addressing a poorly understood
developmental problem, the experiments, as presented, are not sufficient to support the proposed
model of BMP antagonism of TGF-beta signaling. General comments and specific points are
listed below.
General comments:
• One of the main conclusions in this manuscript is that TGF-beta acts in a pro-fusion manner,
and is “inhibited” by BMP; BMP antagonism “unleashes” the ability of TGF-beta to carry out
some effects related to extracellular matrix. The authors use a gain-of-function experiment,
ubiquitous overexpression of BMP4, to “overcome” the BMP antagonism. The missing piece is
that it was never shown that overexpression of BMP4 has any effect on TGF-beta signaling. BMP
overexpression could be acting in a manner independent of TGF-beta signaling. In order to make
this connection, antibody staining for phospho-Smads or changes in downstream transcriptional
activity (using, for example, the authors' TGF-beta reporter line) should be shown in wild type
and manipulated circumstances.
• The title of the paper includes the phrase “…necessity of locally induced BMP antagonism…”.
To demonstrate necessity of local BMP antagonism as proposed in the model, mouse double
mutants for Grem1 and Fst, or zebrafish double mutants for grem2b and fsta, should be analyzed.
Ubiquitous overexpression of BMP4 does not test necessity of locally induced BMP antagonism.
• The cdh6 data, while interesting, seem somewhat unconnected to the main model (TGF-beta
and BMP control of optic fissure development).
• Gene expression analyses shown do not often demonstrate expression “in optic fissure
margins”; in most cases, gene expression shown is in the area of the optic fissure margins.
Sections and co-localization would be necessary to demonstrate whether cells residing in the
optic fissure margins are expressing the gene of interest, or, for example, whether migrating
mesenchyme moving between the margins might be expressing the gene of interest. The
fluorescence image for cdh6 expression was more helpful (Figure 6C).
• The data from the key experiment, involving heat shock-induced overexpression of BMP4, is
difficult to evaluate with low magnification images. Histology or better images of embryos are
necessary to visualize the phenotype. The fluorescence images in Figure 6 (F, I, L, O) were more
helpful.
• It is not established whether TGF-beta2 plays the same role in zebrafish as it does in mouse. To
demonstrate this, a zebrafish TGF-beta2 mutant should be analyzed.
• The language tends to be imprecise in this manuscript and could use editing. For example,
throughout the manuscript, the authors describe TGF-beta; “TGF-beta is a well-known modifier
of the ECM” is one version (Introduction, p.3). This sounds as though TGF-beta protein itself has
enzymatic activity that modifies extracellular matrix proteins directly. If such direct activity does
exist, citations should be included. If TGF-beta exerts its effects through signaling and changes in
gene expression, that should be stated more clearly.
5
Specific points:
• Introduction, p. 3: “It can be assumed that in order to facilitate the fusion of the margins, the
structure of the epithelial margins must be rearranged somehow.”
Histological and ultrastructural studies from Isabelle Hero should be cited here; such
rearrangements are suggested by the data and need not be assumed.
• Figure 1, related to the mouse mutant: the authors state that “the optic fissure margins got in
close proximity to each other but ultimately failed to fuse and instead grew inwards”.
It is difficult in this single section to see that the margins are (or were?) in close proximity to each
other.
• Figure 1, related to the microarray data
What kind of validation was carried out? Are the data shown directly from the microarray, or
was RT-PCR (or some other set of experiments) carried out to directly test the genes of interest
identified in the microarray experiment? Were these candidates validated in TGF-beta2 single
mutants (since the microarray was performed on TGF-beta2/GDNF double mutant eyes)?
• p. 5, related to the microarray data: “…we compared RNA, harvested from eyes of wildtype as
well as TGF-beta2;GDNF double mutant embryos, in which the coloboma phenotype was
assigned to TGF-beta2 function only. Henceforth the effects are termed TGF-beta dependent.”
This was confusing. Were there any other eye phenotypes besides coloboma in the TGF-
beta2/GDNF mouse double mutant? If so, although the coloboma phenotype is TGF-beta2
dependent, there may be other transcriptional effects in the eye that could be GDNF-dependent,
and validation using TGF-beta2 single mutant eyes would be necessary to sort out the effects.
• Figure 2A, related to gene expression patterns:
The authors state that tgfb2 is expressed in periocular tissue at 30 hpf. This is difficult to see in
this view. Can a lateral view or sections be included?
• Figure 2D-D”, related to reporter expression patterns:
What ages are these embryos? The authors state that the reporter is active “within optic fissure
margins”; are these actually optic neuroepithelial cells? Or vasculature? Can this pattern be
correlated with patterns of phospho-Smad3?
• Figure S1, related to SB431542 treatment:
When was the inhibitor applied during embryonic development?
• p. 6, Figure 2E-H, related to SIS3 inhibitor treatment:
Was phospho-Smad3 staining decreased when embryos were treated with SIS3? This would be a
necessary control to demonstrate that the inhibitor is having at least the desired on-target effect.
• p. 6, Figure 3C-D, related to gene expression patterns of grem2b and fsta:
The authors state that the genes of interest are expressed “in the optic fissure margins”. At this
resolution, with whole mount in situ hybridization, it is not clear whether the genes are expressed
in the optic fissure margins; at 30 hpf, genes may be expressed in mesenchymal cells near the
optic fissure or vasculature within the fissure. In order to more clearly show margins, better
images or sections should be shown. fsta, in particular, looks as though it is primarily expressed
in the ciliary marginal zone.
• Figure 3C, grem2b expression pattern:
6
The authors should cite Muller et al., 2006, Developmental Dynamics (235:2881-8), which shows a
time course of grem2b gene expression.
• Figure 5, related to heat shock-induced overexpression of BMP4:
It is difficult to evaluate the coloboma phenotypes and their extent from these images. Histology
(or fluorescence images, as shown in Figure 6) would be helpful.
Minor comments:
• p. 6, Figure 2E-H, related to SIS3 inhibitor treatment:
The figure legend states that treatment was from 18 to 42 hpf, however the text of the paper states
that the treatment was 24 to 48 hpf.
The text also does not match the Figure:
- “Treatment with SIS3 yielded smaller embryos at 3 dpf (Figure 2E, F; see G, H as control).” The
control is E and F whereas the SIS3-treated embryos are in G and H.
- “… treated embryos had coloboma in conjuction with reduced eye size (Figure 2F).” The
treated embryo is H.
• Figure 6, cdh6 morpholino experiments:
Please state what kind of morpholinos are being used (translation or splice blocking?).

Comments to the Author
label_comment_5
The revised manuscript is improved, but significant concerns remain. While there are potentially
interesting and novel observations, the interpretations and model are not necessarily supported
by the data. Many of the remaining concerns can be remedied with significant editing of the text
or modification of the model.
General comments
1. The central premise of the paper is that BMP signaling antagonizes the “pro-fusion” action of
TGF-beta signaling; local antagonism of BMP signaling allows TGF-beta signaling to induce
expression of extracellular matrix molecules. This central premise is not supported: the link
between BMP signaling and inhibition of TGF-beta signaling is not clear. As requested, the
12
authors attempted (unsuccessfully) to use a pSmad2/3 antibody. The authors state in the rebuttal
that no pSmad2/3 antibody has been validated in zebrafish. This is incorrect: a pSmad3 antibody
(which appears to be different from the one the authors tried) was used in Casari et al., 2014 (Dev.
Biol. (396) 81-93), and in fact, this paper also demonstrated use of SB431542 on zebrafish, so it
should probably be cited. Concerns and technical issues with the reporter lines are noted, and I
appreciate that the authors tried this approach.
With respect to changes in TGF-beta target gene expression, the results, as presented, are of
unclear significance. The SIS3 experiment suggests that in zebrafish, grem2b is a target of TGF-
beta signaling, while fsta might not be. The BMP4 overexpression experiment indicates that
grem2b is not significantly changed in expression level (p value = 0.17), while fsta is upregulated.
These data suggest an alternative model, in which BMP4 overexpression is not acting through
changes in TGF-beta signaling (as grem2b is not affected), but is acting through a separate, fsta-
dependent pathway to cause optic fissure defects. This also suggests that TGF-beta target genes
may be different in mouse and zebrafish.
Finally, it is concerning that the authors describe grem2b expression as “downregulated” by
BMP4 overexpression (p. 8), when the result is not statistically significant (p value from the
Figure Legend is 0.17). This description should be made accurate or removed.
2. The title of the paper contains the phrase “necessity of locally induced BMP antagonism”. This
is still not demonstrated. In terms of testing necessity of BMP antagonists, the authors have
raised the potential confounding issue of redundancy of BMP antagonists in zebrafish, which is
appreciated. Therefore, without testing necessity, a solution would be to change the wording to
remove the word necessity in the title and throughout the manuscript. In addition, ubiquitous
overexpression of BMP does not address the idea of “local”. It is clear that overexpression of
BMP does have deleterious effects on optic fissure fusion, but it is not clear that this is acting
through TGF-beta signaling, nor is it clear that this is antagonistic or local. Again, changing the
wording to be more accurate would solve this.
Specific points
3. Figure 1F and p. 4, related to the description of the TGF-beta2 and GDNF mutant eyes:
Although the coloboma phenotype is “assigned” to TGF-beta2 function, it cannot be ruled out
that GDNF mutation might sensitize the background to TGF-beta2 loss, thereby leading to
different changes in gene expression than might be found in a single TGF-beta2 mutant. Gene
expression analysis is shown for TGF-beta2 wild type and mutant eyes, both heterozygous for
GDNF. Was the analysis performed in a GDNF wild type, but mixed background? As stated
above, a concern is that GDNF mutation may sensitize the animal to loss of TGF-beta2, affecting
the transcriptional analyses.
4. Figure S1: the inclusion of frontal mouse sections is appreciated, however, it is difficult to
assess whether the optic fissure margins “grew inwards”. What axis are the authors referring to
with respect to the term “inwards”?
5. p. 5, related to microarray analysis: The authors have retained information about Cadherin 6 in
the text; however, if these results were not found to be consistent during validation, this should
be removed.
6. Figure 2A: It is difficult to tell that TGF-beta2 expression is in the periocular tissue. This image
appears to show staining in the ventral retina.
7. Figure 2D’: The TGF-beta reporter expression is described as being “in the optic fissure
margins”. It is difficult to tell that this is in the margins; it seems to be within the optic fissure

8. Figure 2H: If SIS3 has been previously validated in zebrafish, please include citation(s), or
explain how dose was selected. Was a dose-response curve tested? How did the authors validate
efficacy of the inhibitor? This is important for interpretation of Figure 3G (see below).

10. Figure 3G, related to earlier point regarding SIS3: Is it possible that if SIS3 was not effective at
inhibiting Smad3, this might explain the lack of effect on fsta expression? Was SIS3 use validated
and then followed with in situ for fsta? (The in situ was particularly effective in conveying
upregulation in Figure 6).
11. p. 8, related to Figure 6A: “We found that grem2b was downregulated in the bmp4
overexpression condition…”. This is a misleading statement, as the Figure Legend makes clear
that this is not a statistically significant result. This should be changed.
Minor points
12. p. 3, Introduction: “Coloboma is frequently part of a multi organ syndrome, like CHARGE

Pax2 and Chd7 are reversed; that is, CHARGE syndrome is linked to Chd7, and renal coloboma
syndrome is linked to Pax2.

Comments to the Author
label_comment_6
The manuscript by Knickmeyer and colleagues addresses the role of a TGFbeta/Bmp interaction
in the control of optic fissure closure, making use of mouse and fish model systems. This new
version has been considerably revised and improved, and better supports the conclusions raised
by the authors. Their original transcriptional profile analysis has been improved by including
further controls, and the phenotypic analysis of loss of TGFbeta on optic fissure closure has been
improved and a more careful and rigorous analysis is presented. I still have some comments that
I elaborate below.
-My initial concern with the transcriptomic analysis presented in this study was the fact that the
authors performed it in a tgfb2/GDNF double mutant background but they attribute the changes
observed only to the tgfb2 loss of function. In the new version of the manuscript, the authors
have included further controls and validations of their results on some of the target genes in tgfb2
single loss of function conditions. This adds strength to their results. However, the authors also
show that the phenotype of the tgfb2 single loss of function is a lot less severe than the one
observed in the double mutants. These results indicate, in my opinion, that a potential
requirement for GDNF in contributing to optic fissure closure should not be discarded, and that
the claim that all these results are solely attributed to TGFbeta function is not quite correct.
I keep considering that if the authors want to attribute the phenotype and transcriptomic changes
to tgfb2 by itself during this process, they do need to do these experiments in the correct
background from the start. Otherwise, they should acknowledge in the manuscript that the
scenario may not be so simple and take into consideration a role for GDNF during optic fissure
closure. The fact that GDNF single mutants do not show an optic fissure phenotype does not
mean that it may not be involved in this processs in a network with TGFbeta, and indeed this is
what the authors’ results suggest. As it is presented at the moment, I find it misleading, since a
potentially important part of the story is being overlooked.
-I find satisfactory the analysis of the expression of the Bmp antagonists by qPCR in the SIS3
treated embryos. However, I would still like to see an in situ hybridisation, specially since fsta
expression seems unaffected. Since fsta is expressed in many other regions of the embryo,
changes in the optic fissure may be obscured in a qPCR analysis, but apparent by in situ. This
should not involve any complication for the authors to perform it.
-I keep getting confused with the terminology the authors use to describe their proposed
mechanism. What does “unleashing the ECM remodelling capacity” mean in molecular terms? I
understand that Bmp would normally repress the expression of TGFb downstreams, and
therefore it has to be absent at the fissure for TGFb to be able to activate these downstreams. If
this is actually the proposed mechanism, the authors should state it more explicitly in the text.
Linked to this, could it be considered, as a potential mechanism, that Bmps directly repress the
15
expression of components of the TGFb transduction pathway (either the ligands, the receptors or
other signal transduction components), and that repressing Bmps allows the Tgfb machinery to
be present and functional at the choroid fissure? Or are there any reports that clearly allow to rule
out this possibility? This may be a good point to add in the discussion.
Minor comments:
-The information in figure 4 is not enough to justify one whole figure for it. I would suggest to
incorporate it to Figure 3.
-I could not find in the main text or the text for figure 5, at what time are the treated embryos
being visualised. They look to me like 48hpf? But it should be stated somewhere, either in the text
or in the figure legend.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
The revised manuscript is improved, but significant concerns remain. While there are potentially
interesting and novel observations, the interpretations and model are not necessarily supported
by the data. Many of the remaining concerns can be remedied with significant editing of the text
or modification of the model.
General comments
1. The central premise of the paper is that BMP signaling antagonizes the “pro-fusion” action of
TGF-beta signaling; local antagonism of BMP signaling allows TGF-beta signaling to induce
expression of extracellular matrix molecules. This central premise is not supported: the link
between BMP signaling and inhibition of TGF-beta signaling is not clear. As requested, the
authors attempted (unsuccessfully) to use a pSmad2/3 antibody. The authors state in the rebuttal
that no pSmad2/3 antibody has been validated in zebrafish. This is incorrect: a pSmad3 antibody
(which appears to be different from the one the authors tried) was used in Casari et al., 2014 (Dev.
Biol. (396) 81-93), and in fact, this paper also demonstrated use of SB431542 on zebrafish, so it
should probably be cited. Concerns and technical issues with the reporter lines are noted, and I
appreciate that the authors tried this approach.
With respect to changes in TGF-beta target gene expression, the results, as presented, are of
unclear significance. The SIS3 experiment suggests that in zebrafish, grem2b is a target of TGF-
beta signaling, while fsta might not be. The BMP4 overexpression experiment indicates that
grem2b is not significantly changed in expression level (p value = 0.17), while fsta is upregulated.
These data suggest an alternative model, in which BMP4 overexpression is not acting through
changes in TGF-beta signaling (as grem2b is not affected), but is acting through a separate, fsta-
dependent pathway to cause optic fissure defects. This also suggests that TGF-beta target genes
may be different in mouse and zebrafish.
Finally, it is concerning that the authors describe grem2b expression as “downregulated” by
BMP4 overexpression (p. 8), when the result is not statistically significant (p value from the
Figure Legend is 0.17). This description should be made accurate or removed.
2. The title of the paper contains the phrase “necessity of locally induced BMP antagonism”. This
is still not demonstrated. In terms of testing necessity of BMP antagonists, the authors have
raised the potential confounding issue of redundancy of BMP antagonists in zebrafish, which is
17
appreciated. Therefore, without testing necessity, a solution would be to change the wording to
remove the word necessity in the title and throughout the manuscript. In addition, ubiquitous
overexpression of BMP does not address the idea of “local”. It is clear that overexpression of
BMP does have deleterious effects on optic fissure fusion, but it is not clear that this is acting
through TGF-beta signaling, nor is it clear that this is antagonistic or local. Again, changing the
wording to be more accurate would solve this.
Specific points
3. Figure 1F and p. 4, related to the description of the TGF-beta2 and GDNF mutant eyes:
Although the coloboma phenotype is “assigned” to TGF-beta2 function, it cannot be ruled out
that GDNF mutation might sensitize the background to TGF-beta2 loss, thereby leading to
different changes in gene expression than might be found in a single TGF-beta2 mutant. Gene
expression analysis is shown for TGF-beta2 wild type and mutant eyes, both heterozygous for
GDNF. Was the analysis performed in a GDNF wild type, but mixed background? As stated
above, a concern is that GDNF mutation may sensitize the animal to loss of TGF-beta2, affecting
the transcriptional analyses.
4. Figure S1: the inclusion of frontal mouse sections is appreciated, however, it is difficult to
assess whether the optic fissure margins “grew inwards”. What axis are the authors referring to
with respect to the term “inwards”?
5. p. 5, related to microarray analysis: The authors have retained information about Cadherin 6 in
the text; however, if these results were not found to be consistent during validation, this should
be removed.
6. Figure 2A: It is difficult to tell that TGF-beta2 expression is in the periocular tissue. This image
appears to show staining in the ventral retina.
7. Figure 2D’: The TGF-beta reporter expression is described as being “in the optic fissure
margins”. It is difficult to tell that this is in the margins; it seems to be within the optic fissure
itself (perhaps in mesenchymal cells).
8. Figure 2H: If SIS3 has been previously validated in zebrafish, please include citation(s), or
explain how dose was selected. Was a dose-response curve tested? How did the authors validate
efficacy of the inhibitor? This is important for interpretation of Figure 3G (see below).
9. Figure 2H and p. 7: The Figure and Figure Legend state that treatment was 24-30 hpf. The text
states that the treatment was 24 to 48 hpf. Please clarify.
10. Figure 3G, related to earlier point regarding SIS3: Is it possible that if SIS3 was not effective at
inhibiting Smad3, this might explain the lack of effect on fsta expression? Was SIS3 use validated
and then followed with in situ for fsta? (The in situ was particularly effective in conveying
upregulation in Figure 6).
11. p. 8, related to Figure 6A: “We found that grem2b was downregulated in the bmp4
overexpression condition…”. This is a misleading statement, as the Figure Legend makes clear
that this is not a statistically significant result. This should be changed.

Dear referees,
We first want to thank the referees for the constructive comments. During
the revision work we carefully addressed the referees comments. Please find
below our answers, point by point. We additionally uploaded a file with the
point by point answers.
We want to mention already here, that during our revision work we validated
the expression of our target genes in different conditions. Unexpectedly,
we had to realize that the regulation of cdh6 overall was not consistent
enough. We thus excluded the analyses focusing on cdh6 from our revised
work. We very much appreciate the constructive comments, which pointed into
this direction.
However, we want to stress that we believe that the revised version still
provides sufficient data and conceptual advance to promote the scientific
field. Besides, the referee 2 mentioned that the cdh6 part of our work was
rather unconnected to the rest.
Overall, we are happy to resubmit our revised work and are looking forward
to hearing from the editorial office.
Best regards from Freiburg,
Stephan Heermann
Editor's Comments to Author(s):
Although the results presented are of high quality and of interest for the
field, more work needs to be done to support the conclusions made. The
manuscript is definitely a good match for Open Biology if the authors
respond to the concerns raised by the reviewers, including performing key
additional experiments.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_13
The manuscript by Knickmeyer and colleagues addresses the molecular
mechanisms involved in promoting a poorly understood morphogenetic process,
optic fissure fusion. With their work they identify TGFbeta as a critical
player in this process, and put forward a model by which TGFbeta would
induce the expression of Bmp antagonists in the optic fissure. This would
protect the optic fissure from Bmp activity and would allow TGFbeta to
promote ECM remodelling and fissure fusion.
Although the model proposed by the authors is very attractive, the studies
performed by the authors are not enough to confer strength to this study,
and further experiments should be pursued. I find particularly important to
do more analysis in conditions of loss of TGFbeta activity. These comments
are further elaborated below.
1- The authors show that TGFbeta/GDNF mouse double mutants have a
persistent optic fissure. They attribute this phenotype solely to TGFbeta
since GDNF single mutants have not been reported to have and eye phenotype.
They go on to analyse the transcriptional profile of these double mutants
as compared to wild types, and attribute the changes seen to TGFbeta
function. I am not convinced that this inference can be done without
further controls. Transcriptomic analyses are very sensitive and changes
may be detected that do not translate in phenotypic outcomes. Moreover,
some changes may be compensated by others and thus result in no defective
phenotype. The authors should be cautious about this approach. The best way
of doing this would be to compare TGFbeta single mutants with wild types,
or else add as a further control to their set of data those from GDNF
single mutants (which should be like wild types to support the authors’
claim).
We agree that the comparison of TGFb2 and Wt for transcriptome analysis
would have been the better way from the start. We now validated specific
target genes (Grem1, Fst) by qPCR in TGFb2-KO and control conditions. We
performed these experiments in the mixed background (in GDNF heterozygous
context) as well as in a sole background. Please see the revised manuscript.
Notably, gene regulation was variable in between these experiments. We
further included histological analyses of TGFb2 mutants from the sole
background. Notably, the coloboma phenotype was less obvious compared to
the phenotype observed in the mixed background.
2- Following up from my previous comment, some of the downregulated genes
should be validated by in situ. This could be done in mouse embryos or in
zebrafish embryos. To my understanding, no loss of TGFbeta function
condition has been assessed in the study to test the expression of some of
the genes putatively regulated by TGFbeta activity. I find of particular
importance to test the expression of the Bmp antagonists in loss of TGFbeta
conditions, since they are an integral component of the model put forward
by the authors. This could easily be done in the drug treatments with SIS3.
A phenotypic analysis of TGFbeta loss of function conditions to assess the
integrity of the ECM in the optic fissure should also be done.
We thank the referee for this comment and further addressed the gene
regulation. We used quantitative PCR for validation of the target genes in
mice and zebrafish. Please see the revised version of our manuscript.
Notably, the regulation of the target genes differed depending on the
genetic background of the mice and between zebrafish and mouse.
To address the effects of TGF-beta loss on ECM integrity, we included anti-
laminin immunohistochemistry on SIS3-treated zebrafish embryos in Figure
2G&J of the revised manuscript. There, the basal lamina of the optic
fissure margins is still intact at 3 dpf.
3- Regarding the drug treatments with SIS3, the phenotype shown is
extremely severe, and the authors should be cautious to attribute the optic
fissure defect to a problem in fusion-indeed, the eye, and the whole head,
seems quite affected, and the edema phenotype suggests blood circulation
defects that could indirectly affect fissure closure. Have the authors
tried to do treatments more narrowed down in time? I would recommend doing
a series of treatments (in several time windows and shorter treatments), so
that they identify a condition that does not induce such strong
morphological defects in the whole embryo for further analysis of the eye
phenotype.
A series of treatments has been performed. In the revised version of the
manuscript we present data resulting from an updated treatment scheme.
4- The cadherin6 results provide suggestive information but the authors do
not seem to take this beyond a preliminary stage. Again, the authors do not
show whether cadherin6 expression is affected in embryos devoid of TGFbeta
activity. The cdh6 morpholino phenotypes are very severe and the embryos
seem delayed, and thus the claim of a requirement for optic fissure closure
should be taken with caution. Ideally, local inactivation of cdh6 should be
attempted to show a specific requirement in the optic fissure.
We agree that per se a phenotypic outcome has to be taken with caution,
considering a potential developmental delay. Therefore, we took extra care
and waited until 3dpf (Figure 6D-O) with the analysis of the outcome. Under
normal conditions the optic fissure is closing starting approx. 24hpf. Thus,
it is very unlikely that the phenotype can be explained by just a
developmental delay. We are not aware of any experimental approach, which
would have allowed us to pursue a local inactivation of cdh6 within the
revision process.
During our revision work we validated the expression of our target genes in
different conditions. Unexpectedly, we had to realize that the regulation
of cdh6 overall was not consistent enough. Although it was e.g.
downregulated in the zebrafish after SIS3 treatment, we decided to exclude
the cadherin data from this manuscript in order to test the role of cdh6
more rigorously.
We very much appreciate the critical but very constructive comment.
5- In addtion, it seems unclear to me what would be the mechanism by which
loss of cadherin6 would lead to coloboma. Would it be the inability of
cells at both sides of the fissure to establish new contacts? How would
this relate to defects in ECM remodelling?
We excluded the further analyses focusing on cdh6 from our revised work.
Please the point 4 and the revised manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_14
In this manuscript, the authors explore the roles of TGF-beta signaling,
BMP signaling, and cadherin-6 in optic fissure fusion in mouse and
zebrafish. A microarray experiment is carried out on TGF-beta/GDNF double
mutant mouse eyes to identify transcripts of potential relevance to mutant
phenotypes, including optic fissure fusion. Based on the genes identified
and ubiquitous BMP4 overexpression, the authors propose a model in which
TGF-beta promotes optic fissure fusion in a manner that is dependent upon
local expression of BMP antagonists. There are also some experiments
carried out related to a potential role for cadherin-6 in optic fissure
fusion and its regulation by BMP.
While there are some potentially interesting and novel data here addressing
a poorly understood developmental problem, the experiments, as presented,
are not sufficient to support the proposed model of BMP antagonism of TGF-
beta signaling. General comments and specific points are listed below.
General comments:
1• One of the main conclusions in this manuscript is that TGF-beta acts in
a pro-fusion manner, and is “inhibited” by BMP; BMP antagonism “unleashes”
the ability of TGF-beta to carry out some effects related to extracellular
matrix. The authors use a gain-of-function experiment, ubiquitous
overexpression of BMP4, to “overcome” the BMP antagonism. The missing
piece is that it was never shown that overexpression of BMP4 has any effect
on TGF-beta signaling. BMP overexpression could be acting in a manner
independent of TGF-beta signaling. In order to make this connection,
antibody staining for phospho-Smads or changes in downstream
transcriptional activity (using, for example, the authors' TGF-beta
reporter line) should be shown in wild type and manipulated
circumstances.
We thank the referee for this comment. We conducted the experiments
suggested in order to show an effect of BMP on TGF-beta signaling.
Unfortunately, there is no pSmad2/3 antibody available which has been
validated in zebrafish. We have previously successfully used the pSmad1/5/8
Antibody (#13820) from Cell Signaling Technologies in zebrafish, which is
why we selected their pSmad2/3 antibody (#8828) to conduct the proposed
experiments. However, in multiple trial runs we could not achieve any
specific staining with this antibody in whole-mount embryos or sections and
therefore were unable to validate the antibody.
As further proposed, we also crossed our TGFb reporter line to the
inducible BMP4 line to get experimental evidence for the inhibition of TGFß
signaling by BMP. We employed a heat shock at 24 hpf and recorded multiple
confocal stacks over the course of 6 hours.
We have to stress the point that the reporter line is based on a
transcriptional regulation of GFP(caax), meaning that the visibility of
signaling activity is delayed.
Unfortunately, the reporter activity within the optic fissure margins
declines during the onset of fissure fusion even in control samples, what
hampers the analyses.
We then tried to show an effect of BMP on TGFb signaling at 18 hpf, when
reporter expression is starting in the developing optic stalk and cup
(Eckert et al., 2017, biorXiv). In line with our results presented in
figure 5, we expected to create a defect in optic cup morphogenesis by
inducing BMP expression as early as 18 hpf. We hoped, nonetheless, that
this would give us enough time to observe a differential expression of the
reporter as time proceeded. Unexpectedly, with a heat shock at 18 hpf we
changed optic cup development in a manner that would largely prevent the
formation of the optic fissure. Moreover, TGFb reporter expression
increased markedly in the optic stalks and deformed optic vesicles of
embryos with BMP4 overexpression. These experiments suggest that the
interaction of the signaling pathways likely is different at different
stages during eye development. While this result is very interesting and
will be investigated further in the future, it does not further our
knowledge of TGFb-BMP interaction in optic fissure closure.
To still address the interplay between TGFb and BMP we now addressed the
effect induced BMP expression has on TGFb target genes. Please see the
revised manuscript. Notably and unexpectedly, grem2 and fsta were regulated
differently.
2• The title of the paper includes the phrase “…necessity of locally
induced BMP antagonism…”. To demonstrate necessity of local BMP antagonism
as proposed in the model, mouse double mutants for Grem1 and Fst, or
zebrafish double mutants for grem2b and fsta, should be
analyzed. Ubiquitous overexpression of BMP4 does not test necessity of
locally induced BMP antagonism.
We thank the referee for this comment. We thought about similar experiments.
However, our previous data (Heermann et al.,2015 doi:
10.7554/eLife.05216)strongly suggest that an early negative effect on bmp
antagonists (in this case fsta) will result in a severe morphogenetic eye
phenotype. BMP antagonism thus has at least a dual role during eye
development. The first during the “neuroretinal” flow, which must be
maintained, and the second during optic fissure fusion (this manuscript).
3• The cdh6 data, while interesting, seem somewhat unconnected to the main
model (TGF-beta and BMP control of optic fissure development).
We excluded the further data focusing on cdh6 from the revised manuscript.
4• Gene expression analyses shown do not often demonstrate expression “in
optic fissure margins”; in most cases, gene expression shown is in the area
of the optic fissure margins. Sections and co-localization would be
necessary to demonstrate whether cells residing in the optic fissure
margins are expressing the gene of interest, or, for example, whether
migrating mesenchyme moving between the margins might be expressing the
gene of interest. The fluorescence image for cdh6 expression was more
helpful (Figure 6C).
We want to thank the referee for this comment. We added confocal images for
the expression patterns in question to the revised version.
5• The data from the key experiment, involving heat shock-induced
overexpression of BMP4, is difficult to evaluate with low magnification
images. Histology or better images of embryos are necessary to visualize
the phenotype. The fluorescence images in Figure 6 (F, I, L, O) were more
helpful.
We want to thank the referee for this comment. We increased magnification
on the brightfield images in Figure 5 and also provided confocal images
with DAPI staining of the main phenotype and a control in the revised
version.
6• It is not established whether TGF-beta2 plays the same role in
zebrafish as it does in mouse. To demonstrate this, a zebrafish TGF-beta2
mutant should be analyzed.
This issue is focusing on a very interesting topic. We agree, that it is
not clear which TGFb ligand is important for the fusion of the optic
fissure margins in zebrafish. However, we do not claim that the tgfb2 is
the correct ligand in zebrafish. Furthermore, the additional whole genome
duplication the teleost species underwent during evolution is making such
comparative analysis even more difficult.
7• The language tends to be imprecise in this manuscript and could use
editing. For example, throughout the manuscript, the authors describe TGF-
beta; “TGF-beta is a well-known modifier of the ECM” is one version
(Introduction, p.3). This sounds as though TGF-beta protein itself has
enzymatic activity that modifies extracellular matrix proteins
directly. If such direct activity does exist, citations should be
included. If TGF-beta exerts its effects through signaling and changes in
gene expression, that should be stated more clearly.
We clarified the statements regarding TGFb in the revised manuscript.
Specific points:
8• Introduction, p. 3: “It can be assumed that in order to facilitate the
fusion of the margins, the structure of the epithelial margins must be
rearranged somehow.”
Histological and ultrastructural studies from Isabelle Hero should be cited
here; such rearrangements are suggested by the data and need not be assumed.
We gave the data from Hero more room, when discussing the morphological
changes. However, more changes are occurring during optic fissure fusion,
which we addressed in a different project (Eckert et al., 2017, bioRxiv,
doi.org/10.1101/141275 ).
9• Figure 1, related to the mouse mutant: the authors state that “the
optic fissure margins got in close proximity to each other but ultimately
failed to fuse and instead grew inwards”.
It is difficult in this single section to see that the margins are (or
were?) in close proximity to each other.
In order to clarify this point, we included a series of frontal sections
from the same embryo in the new supplemental figure S1.
10• Figure 1, related to the microarray data
What kind of validation was carried out? Are the data shown directly from
the microarray, or was RT-PCR (or some other set of experiments) carried
out to directly test the genes of interest identified in the microarray
experiment? Were these candidates validated in TGF-beta2 single mutants
(since the microarray was performed on TGF-beta2/GDNF double mutant eyes)?
The data addressing the transcriptional changes are based on the original
microarray data, which was performed on three mutants and three controls,
hybridized to individual chips We now validated specific target genes
(Grem1, Fst) with qPCR in TGFb2-KOs and controls. This we did in a mixed
genetic background (in the GDNF heterozygous condition) as well as on a
sole genetic background.
11• p. 5, related to the microarray data: “…we compared RNA, harvested
from eyes of wildtype as well as TGF-beta2;GDNF double mutant embryos, in
which the coloboma phenotype was assigned to TGF-beta2 function
only. Henceforth the effects are termed TGF-beta dependent.”
This was confusing. Were there any other eye phenotypes besides coloboma
in the TGF-beta2/GDNF mouse double mutant? If so, although the coloboma
phenotype is TGF-beta2 dependent, there may be other transcriptional
effects in the eye that could be GDNF-dependent, and validation using TGF-
beta2 single mutant eyes would be necessary to sort out the effects.
In the TGFb2 single mutants several phenotypes, also concerning the eye,
were described like an altered layering of the neuroretina. Based on
histology and gross morphology these phenotypes are also detectable in the
TGFb2/GDNF context (Figure 1).
In addition we identified a coloboma.
Notably, TGFb2/GDNF mutants infrequently showed also a “dorsal coloboma”,
which, however, could also be detected in the TGFb2 single mutant context.
For this please see the revised manuscripts supplemental data. Overall the
penetrance of this was very infrequent and also the intensity of the
phenotype was variable. We are happy to further discuss also “dorsal
coloboma”. However, the focus of this current work is the fissure fusion.
Notably, we now realized that the coloboma phenotype in TGFb mutant mice
from a sole background was less severe compared to our previous data,
suggesting dependency on the genetic background.
We now validated specific target genes with qPCR in TGFb2 KO vs. +/+
context (in GDNF het conditions, mixed background) as well as in a sole
background to assign these genes to TGFb2.
Please see the revised manuscript.
12• Figure 2A, related to gene expression patterns:
The authors state that tgfb2 is expressed in periocular tissue at 30
hpf. This is difficult to see in this view. Can a lateral view or
sections be included?
We replaced the figure in question by an image with lateral perspective.
13• Figure 2D-D”, related to reporter expression patterns:
What ages are these embryos? The authors state that the reporter is active
“within optic fissure margins”; are these actually optic neuroepithelial
cells? Or vasculature? Can this pattern be correlated with patterns of
phospho-Smad3?
This data was taken from in vivo imaging data. The age at the depicted
timepoint is approximately 24 hpf. The cells with active reporter are
neuroepithelial cells which are part of the optic stalk and the optic cup.
For the question concerning pSmad3 staining, please see our answer to point
1 above.
14• Figure S1, related to SB431542 treatment:
When was the inhibitor applied during embryonic development?
The inhibitor treatment was started at approx. 24 hpf. Inhibitor was
renewed during treatment. We updated the figure legend to include this
information.
15• p. 6, Figure 2E-H, related to SIS3 inhibitor treatment:
Was phospho-Smad3 staining decreased when embryos were treated with
SIS3? This would be a necessary control to demonstrate that the inhibitor
is having at least the desired on-target effect.
For the question concerning pSmad3 staining, please see our answer to point
1 above.
16• p. 6, Figure 3C-D, related to gene expression patterns of grem2b and
fsta:
The authors state that the genes of interest are expressed “in the optic
fissure margins”. At this resolution, with whole mount in situ
hybridization, it is not clear whether the genes are expressed in the optic
fissure margins; at 30 hpf, genes may be expressed in mesenchymal cells
near the optic fissure or vasculature within the fissure. In order to more
clearly show margins, better images or sections should be shown. fsta, in
particular, looks as though it is primarily expressed in the ciliary
marginal zone.
We agree with the referee that the images included originally did not
sufficiently support our statement. We therefore added confocal images of
grem2b and fsta expression at 30 hpf which show expression in the fissure
margins clearly.
17• Figure 3C, grem2b expression pattern:
The authors should cite Muller et al., 2006, Developmental Dynamics
(235:2881-8), which shows a time course of grem2b gene expression.
We want to thank the referee for this comment. We included this citation.
18• Figure 5, related to heat shock-induced overexpression of BMP4:
It is difficult to evaluate the coloboma phenotypes and their extent from
these images. Histology (or fluorescence images, as shown in Figure 6)
would be helpful.
We complemented figure 5 with fluorescence images of the phenotype in the
revised version.
Minor comments:
19• p. 6, Figure 2E-H, related to SIS3 inhibitor treatment:
The figure legend states that treatment was from 18 to 42 hpf, however the
text of the paper states that the treatment was 24 to 48 hpf.
The text also does not match the Figure:
- “Treatment with SIS3 yielded smaller embryos at 3 dpf (Figure 2E, F; see
G, H as control).” The control is E and F whereas the SIS3-treated embryos
are in G and H.
- “… treated embryos had coloboma in conjuction with reduced eye size
(Figure 2F).” The treated embryo is H.
We are sorry for this mistake. We corrected it in the revised version.
20• Figure 6, cdh6 morpholino experiments:
Please state what kind of morpholinos are being used (translation or splice
blocking?).
The morpholinos used were translation blocking.
Appendix B
Dear Prof. Mlodzik,
at first, we want to thank the editor and the editorial office for the constructive comments on our
work. We are especially happy that the overall quality of data was considered to be good. During
evision, we took extra care of our interpretations and we were more cautious and rigorous with the
nterpretation of our data.
We appreciate the referees comments. Please find below our answers, point by point. In addition to
he editorial changes within the manuscript we addressed some concerns also experimentally (e.g.
he use of another p-smad3-antibody), even though no further experiments were suggested by the
editor. Please find a brief description of these also in the point by point answers.
Overall, we are happy to resubmit our revised work and are looking forward to hearing from the
editorial office.
Best regards from Freiburg,

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_15
The revised manuscript is improved, but significant concerns remain. While there are potentially
nteresting and novel observations, the interpretations and model are not necessarily supported by
he data. Many of the remaining concerns can be remedied with significant editing of the text or
modification of the model.
General comments
1. The central premise of the paper is that BMP signaling antagonizes the “pro-fusion” action of TGF-
beta signaling; local antagonism of BMP signaling allows TGF-beta signaling to induce expression of
extracellular matrix molecules. This central premise is not supported: the link between BMP
ignaling and inhibition of TGF-beta signaling is not clear. As requested, the authors attempted
unsuccessfully) to use a pSmad2/3 antibody. The authors state in the rebuttal that no pSmad2/3
antibody has been validated in zebrafish. This is incorrect: a pSmad3 antibody (which appears to be
different from the one the authors tried) was used in Casari et al., 2014 (Dev. Biol. (396) 81-93), and
n fact, this paper also demonstrated use of SB431542 on zebrafish, so it should probably be
cited. Concerns and technical issues with the reporter lines are noted, and I appreciate that the
authors tried this approach.
With respect to changes in TGF-beta target gene expression, the results, as presented, are of unclear
ignificance. The SIS3 experiment suggests that in zebrafish, grem2b is a target of TGF-beta signaling,
while fsta might not be. The BMP4 overexpression experiment indicates that grem2b is not
ignificantly changed in expression level (p value = 0.17), while fsta is upregulated. These data
uggest an alternative model, in which BMP4 overexpression is not acting through changes in TGF-
beta signaling (as grem2b is not affected), but is acting through a separate, fsta-dependent pathway
o cause optic fissure defects. This also suggests that TGF-beta target genes may be different in
mouse and zebrafish.
Finally, it is concerning that the authors describe grem2b expression as “downregulated” by BMP4
overexpression (p. 8), when the result is not statistically significant (p value from the Figure Legend is
0.17). This description should be made accurate or removed.
We thank the referee for this comment. We must have missed the mentioned antibody used by
Casari and colleagues. Unfortunately, however, the antibody also recognizes phosphorylated Smad1,
Smad2, and Smad5, as is stated on the manufacturers homepage (http://www.abcam.com/smad3-
phospho-s423-s425-antibody-ep823y-ab52903.html). Nevertheless, we made use of this antibody to
est the efficiency of SIS3 treatment and the effect of BMP overexpression on TGF<U+F062> signaling.
n accordance with the recognition of the “BMP sensitive smads” by this antibody, we observed
taining largely in the dorsal retina of untreated wild type fish, a region where we previously found
pSmad1/5/8 staining (Heermann et al. eLife 2015;4:e05216. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.05216, Figure 4A-C).
Thus, the antibody is not suitable for the tests we intended to perform. We included the citation
Casari et al.) regarding the use of SB431542 in the revised version of the manuscript.
We agree with the referee that the relevance of the results regarding TGF<U+F062> target gene expression is
unclear. It is true that the regulation of grem2b in the BMP overexpression condition is not
tatistically significant. We now also explicitly point this out in the revised manuscript. Please see the
evised version of the manuscript. We now rather name the regulation “by trend”, because, in our
opinion our data also do not suggest in the reverse conclusion that grem2b expression is not affected
by BMP induction at all. We see lowered expression in 2 out of 3 samples. In addition, we adapted
our model. A BMP induced modification of TGF<U+F062> dependent targets could potentially also be
occurring on a transcriptional level of certain genes, which are co-regulated by BMP and TGF<U+F062> in
opposite directions.
Concerning fsta, we thank the referee for the suggested alternative interpretation. Such alternative
unction of fsta would be interesting and cannot be excluded. However, we find it unlikely that fsta
elevation is “a” or “the” factor inhibiting the fusion of the fissure margins, especially since we found
sta downregulated in our coloboma model (mouse).
To us it seems more likely that the elevation of fsta is resulting from a feedback loop, which is
activated upon BMP induction. We discussed these issues in the manuscript. Please see the revised
version.
2. The title of the paper contains the phrase “necessity of locally induced BMP antagonism”. This is
till not demonstrated. In terms of testing necessity of BMP antagonists, the authors have raised the
potential confounding issue of redundancy of BMP antagonists in zebrafish, which is
appreciated. Therefore, without testing necessity, a solution would be to change the wording to
emove the word necessity in the title and throughout the manuscript. In addition, ubiquitous
overexpression of BMP does not address the idea of “local”. It is clear that overexpression of BMP
does have deleterious effects on optic fissure fusion, but it is not clear that this is acting through TGF-
beta signaling, nor is it clear that this is antagonistic or local. Again, changing the wording to be more
accurate would solve this.
We have changed the title of the paper in accordance with the referee’s comment. Please see the
evised manuscript.
Specific points
3. Figure 1F and p. 4, related to the description of the TGF-beta2 and GDNF mutant eyes: Although
he coloboma phenotype is “assigned” to TGF-beta2 function, it cannot be ruled out that GDNF
mutation might sensitize the background to TGF-beta2 loss, thereby leading to different changes in
gene expression than might be found in a single TGF-beta2 mutant. Gene expression analysis is
hown for TGF-beta2 wild type and mutant eyes, both heterozygous for GDNF. Was the analysis
performed in a GDNF wild type, but mixed background? As stated above, a concern is that GDNF
mutation may sensitize the animal to loss of TGF-beta2, affecting the transcriptional analyses.
We appreciate the referees comment. In Figure 1F we only used GDNF heterozygous material in the
gene expression analysis. Importantly, the histology presented in Figure 1A-B and S1A-B are from
GDNF +/+ embryos from a mixed breeding background, bred from TGFb2 +/-, GDNF +/- parents.
The transcriptional data presented in Figure 1I was resulting from tissue of a sole TGF<U+F062>2 mutant line.
This we introduced during the first revision.
Overall, we also found the idea intriguing that GDNF could play a role itself or a sensitizing role in
combination with TGF<U+F062>. However, since we observed “strong” coloboma phenotypes also in embryos
having TGF<U+F062>2 KO, a GDNF WT locus in a mixed genetic background due to breeding (Figure 1B, Figure
S1A-B), we find it more likely that the genetic background influences the intensity of the phenotype
ince in TGF<U+F062>2KO from a sole genetic background the phenotype was less severe (Figure 1D). On the
other hand, we still cannot exclude the GDNF involvement. We thus discuss these scenarios in the
evised version of the manuscript.
4. Figure S1: the inclusion of frontal mouse sections is appreciated; however, it is difficult to assess
whether the optic fissure margins “grew inwards”. What axis are the authors referring to with
espect to the term “inwards”?
We are sorry that our description was not clear enough. We rephrased it in the revised version of our
manuscript.
5. p. 5, related to microarray analysis: The authors have retained information about Cadherin 6 in
he text; however, if these results were not found to be consistent during validation, this should be
emoved.
We removed Cadherin 6 from Figure 1 and the text of the revised manuscript.
6. Figure 2A: It is difficult to tell that TGF-beta2 expression is in the periocular tissue. This image
appears to show staining in the ventral retina.
We have included a new image to provide both frontal and lateral views. The new image shows that
he expression domain of tgfb2 is mostly medial and ventral of the optic cup. Please see the revised
Figure 2A.
7. Figure 2D’: The TGF-beta reporter expression is described as being “in the optic fissure
margins”. It is difficult to tell that this is in the margins; it seems to be within the optic fissure itself
perhaps in mesenchymal cells).
We carefully addressed reporter expression. We find it expressed in the neuroectodermal tissues of
he optic cup.
8. Figure 2H: If SIS3 has been previously validated in zebrafish, please include citation(s), or explain
how dose was selected. Was a dose-response curve tested? How did the authors validate efficacy of
he inhibitor? This is important for interpretation of Figure 3G (see below).
SIS3 had not been used and validated in zebrafish when we conducted our experiments. It is,
however, regularly used in cell culture (e.g. Khakipoor et al., 2017. Glia 65(8):1361-1375. doi:
10.1002/glia.23168). We increased the concentration used in cell culture threefold (to 9µM) in our
nitial experiments, arguing that a whole embryo with intact tissues might require a higher dose than
ingle cells. Since this concentration worked in our hands, we did not change it while proceeding
urther. Meanwhile, SIS3 has been validated in zebrafish (Dogra et al., 2017. Nat Com 8:1902. doi:
10.1038/s41467-017-01950-1) at a concentration of 3µM.
9. Figure 2H and p. 7: The Figure and Figure Legend state that treatment was 24-30 hpf. The text
tates that the treatment was 24 to 48 hpf. Please clarify.
We thank the referee for pointing at this. The information in the text was changed to state the
correct time (24-30 hpf). Please see the revised manuscript.
10. Figure 3G, related to earlier point regarding SIS3: Is it possible that if SIS3 was not effective at
nhibiting Smad3, this might explain the lack of effect on fsta expression? Was SIS3 use validated and
hen followed with in situ for fsta? (The in situ was particularly effective in conveying upregulation in
Figure 6).
Please see also our answer to point 8. The efficacy of SIS3 was demonstrated by others. We checked
sta expression by in situ hybridization in SIS3 treated embryos in comparison to DMSO treated
embryos. We observed at most a subtle decrease of expression in the optic fissure margins following
reatment, but not to an extent at which we could confidently claim that fsta is locally regulated by
Smad3. Moreover, fsta could potentially be regulated mainly or completely via Smad2 and not
Smad3, which we would be unable to detect by SIS3 treatment. When validating SIS3 use by
quantitative PCR, Dogra and colleagues (2017, Nat Com 8:1902. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-01950-1)
compared genes regulated solely regulated by either Smad2 or Smad3. SIS3 did not influence the
expression of Smad2-regulated genes. We discuss this possibility in the revised version of the
manuscript.
11. p. 8, related to Figure 6A: “We found that grem2b was downregulated in the bmp4
overexpression condition…”. This is a misleading statement, as the Figure Legend makes clear that
his is not a statistically significant result. This should be changed.
Please see our answer to point 1.
Minor points
12. p. 3, Introduction: “Coloboma is frequently part of a multi organ syndrome, like CHARGE
yndrome or renal coloboma syndrome, linked to Pax2 and Chd7 respectively…”
Pax2 and Chd7 are reversed; that is, CHARGE syndrome is linked to Chd7, and renal coloboma
yndrome is linked to Pax2.
We have corrected this mistake in the revised manuscript.
13. p. 5, “TGF-beta signalling is well known for its control of ECM remodelling in various
processes.” Please add citations.
We have added citations to support the statement in the revised manuscript.
14. p.6, “We found the TGF-beta signalling reporter active within the optic fissure margins (Figure 1D,
D’, see Shh reporter activity for orientation (D”)).” The authors probably meant Figure 2D, D’.
We thank the referee for pointing to this. We have corrected this mistake in the revised manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_16
The manuscript by Knickmeyer and colleagues addresses the role of a TGFbeta/Bmp interaction in
he control of optic fissure closure, making use of mouse and fish model systems. This new version
has been considerably revised and improved, and better supports the conclusions raised by the
authors. Their original transcriptional profile analysis has been improved by including further controls,
and the phenotypic analysis of loss of TGFbeta on optic fissure closure has been improved and a
more careful and rigorous analysis is presented. I still have some comments that I elaborate below.
My initial concern with the transcriptomic analysis presented in this study was the fact that the
authors performed it in a tgfb2/GDNF double mutant background but they attribute the changes
observed only to the tgfb2 loss of function. In the new version of the manuscript, the authors have
ncluded further controls and validations of their results on some of the target genes in tgfb2 single
oss of function conditions. This adds strength to their results. However, the authors also show that
he phenotype of the tgfb2 single loss of function is a lot less severe than the one observed in the
double mutants. These results indicate, in my opinion, that a potential requirement for GDNF in
contributing to optic fissure closure should not be discarded, and that the claim that all these results
are solely attributed to TGFbeta function is not quite correct.
keep considering that if the authors want to attribute the phenotype and transcriptomic changes to
gfb2 by itself during this process, they do need to do these experiments in the correct background
rom the start. Otherwise, they should acknowledge in the manuscript that the scenario may not be
o simple and take into consideration a role for GDNF during optic fissure closure. The fact that GDNF
ingle mutants do not show an optic fissure phenotype does not mean that it may not be involved in
his processs in a network with TGFbeta, and indeed this is what the authors’ results suggest. As it is
presented at the moment, I find it misleading, since a potentially important part of the story is being
overlooked.
We appreciate the referees comment. We also found the idea fascinating that GDNF could play a role
tself or be a sensitizing factor in combination with TGF<U+F062>. We cannot exclude such a sensitizing role.
We thus discuss it in the revised version of our manuscript.
However, we find it more likely that the genetic background is affecting the intensity of the
coloboma phenotype. Considering the phenotypes presented in Figure S1A and B to S1C, we find a
trong coloboma in all conditions. Importantly, here we present TGF<U+F062>2 KO (A and B) and
TGF<U+F062>2/GDNF double KO, all derived from a mixed breeding background. However, when we consider
he phenotypes presented in Figure 1B and 1D, we agree that the coloboma in 1D is a lot less severe.
The difference in between these samples, however, is the breeding background, which is mixed in B
and sole in D.
On the other hand, we still cannot exclude the GDNF involvement. We thus discuss both scenarios in
he revised version of the manuscript.
I find satisfactory the analysis of the expression of the Bmp antagonists by qPCR in the SIS3 treated
embryos. However, I would still like to see an in situ hybridisation, specially since fsta expression
eems unaffected. Since fsta is expressed in many other regions of the embryo, changes in the optic
issure may be obscured in a qPCR analysis, but apparent by in situ. This should not involve any
complication for the authors to perform it.
We checked fsta expression by in situ hybridization in SIS3 treated embryos in comparison to DMSO
reated embryos. We observed at most a subtle decrease of expression in the optic fissure margins
ollowing treatment, but not to an extent at which we could confidently claim that fsta is locally
egulated by Smad3. We believe that using ISH as a quantitative method is potentially problematic.
E.g. we have in parallel addressed grem2b with ISH. Even though we documented a strong
downregulation of grem2b resulting from SIS3 treatment with qPCR, we could not unambiguously
visualize such repression with ISH. The short staining time of approx. 30 minutes necessary for fsta
and grem2b probes might have contributed to this problem.
Considering that genes regulated by Smad2 and genes regulated by Smad3 are apparently distinct
groups, it occurred to us that fsta might still be a TGFb target in fish if it would be regulated mainly or
completely by Smad2. When validating SIS3 use by quantitative PCR, Dogra and colleagues (2017,
Nat Com 8:1902. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-01950-1) compared genes regulated solely regulated by
either Smad2 or Smad3. SIS3 did not influence the expression of Smad2-regulated genes. We discuss
his possibility in the revised version of the manuscript.
I keep getting confused with the terminology the authors use to describe their proposed mechanism.
What does “unleashing the ECM remodelling capacity” mean in molecular terms? I understand that
Bmp would normally repress the expression of TGFb downstreams, and therefore it has to be absent
at the fissure for TGFb to be able to activate these downstreams. If this is actually the proposed
mechanism, the authors should state it more explicitly in the text.
We are sorry that the terminology was confusing. We changed the wording of the passages the
eferee was referring to in the revised version of the manuscript.
Linked to this, could it be considered, as a potential mechanism, that Bmps directly repress the
expression of components of the TGFb transduction pathway (either the ligands, the receptors or
other signal transduction components), and that repressing Bmps allows the Tgfb machinery to be
present and functional at the choroid fissure? Or are there any reports that clearly allow to rule out
his possibility? This may be a good point to add in the discussion.
We appreciate this comment. It is certainly possible that BMP might target the regulation of TGF<U+F062>
ignaling components such as receptors or transduction components even on the transcriptional
evel, opposing TGF<U+F062> function on distinct regulatory elements. We included this idea into the revised
version of the manuscript.
Minor comments:
The information in figure 4 is not enough to justify one whole figure for it. I would suggest to
ncorporate it to Figure 3.
We have followed this recommendation of the referee.
I could not find in the main text or the text for figure 5, at what time are the treated embryos being
visualised. They look to me like 48hpf? But it should be stated somewhere, either in the text or in the
igure legend.
Please see the figure legend of now figure 4 for the age of the embryos.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_18
The writing and tone of the manuscript are improved, but there are a few minor concerns.
At first, we want to thank the referee for the constructive criticism throughout the revision
process.
Specific points:
1. Figure 1A-D: please add labels for mixed and sole backgrounds.
Labels have been added to the respective figure, as well to the Figure S1.
2. p. 5, "Overall, the optic fissure margins in our colobomatous embryos must have gotten in
close proximity to each other..."
t is difficult to know how the authors made conclusions about proximity.
We thank the referee for this comment. The “close proximity” can be appreciated in the
Figure 1B and Figure S1A, B. In the supplemental figure, different sections of individual eyes
are shown. It can be appreciated that, even though in some regions a gap is visible,
especially in the apical domain of the prospective neuroretina, in other regions the margins
are almost touching or even in contact. We adjusted the description: “Overall, the optic
issure margins in our colobomatous embryos must have gotten in close proximity to each
other, but ultimately failed to fuse and instead grew inwards towards the lens (Figure 1B,
Figure S1A, B, showing different sections of individual eyes).”
3. I apologize if I missed this, but please specify the age of the embryo in Figure 2D-D".
We thank the referee for this comment. We gave the age of the embryos shown here in a
ebuttal letter, but must have missed it to include it into the figure legend. We now included
t.
4. Figure 2D', p. 7: "We found the TGF-beta signalling reporter active within the optic fissure
margins..."
The authors responded to this concern in the previous review (point #7), by saying that they
"carefully addressed reporter expression" and that it is "in the neuroectodermal
issues". Yet this is not so clear in the image. Do the authors have a higher magnification
mage with cellular resolution they can include? In this view, the reporter expression
appears that it could still be in the mesenchyme within the fissure.
We thank the referee for this comment. The localization over time of the TGF<U+F062> signaling
eporter is part of another manuscript of our group. Please see further information on
bioRxiv: Priska Eckert, Lucas Schuetz, Joachim Wittbrodt, Stephan Heermann
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/141275
n Figure 5 the TGF<U+F062> signaling reporter activity is depicted over time. We hope that this is
sufficient additional supporting information with respect to the domain of TGF<U+F062> signaling
activity.
5. Methods: please specify the specific mouse strains used (mixed and sole), in particular
because this affects the results.
We appreciate the referees comment.
We are aware that the mouse line generation following the KO strategy, both given in the
original publications, is a bit ambiguous. Please see the publications by Sanford et al., and
Pichel et al.,.
We thus decided to cite the original publications, of the TGF<U+F062>2 and the GDNF-KO mice. We
agree, however, that knowing more about the genetic background problems, potentially
masking “one” and enhancing “another” phenotype would be great. This however, was not
he focus of our analyses.
We do hope that this information is sufficient. We extended the paragraph in our
manuscript, however, by the additional information, that the TGF<U+F062>2 KO line, named “sole
breeding background”, was maintained in our lab by also crossings with C57BL/6 mice.
Please see the revised manuscript.
