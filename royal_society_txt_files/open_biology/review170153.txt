This is a very interesting article that makes use of very unique longitudinal drug response data
and encourages progress in evaluating the multiplicative influence of different genetic factors on
disease risk and medication tolerance. The authors focus on the theory that DISC1 and its
interacting partners may collectively associate with risk for schizophrenia in some families. They
previously identified an association for NDE1, a DISC1 binding partner, with the disorder and
focused this article on evaluating the possible implications for NDE1 and its larger interacting
network in schizophrenia and drug response in a variety of disorders. They speculate that SNPs
within the NDE1 locus alter the expression of miR-484 and therefore the genes that it regulates.
They suggest that miR-484 regulates CYP2C19 expression and therefore impacts metabolism of
drugs by this enzyme.
Major concerns:
1) Discussion about the possible mechanism of the NDE1 SNPs on miR-484 expression is
necessary.
2) Discussion of the mechanism between CYP2C19 regulation with the NDE1 SNPs is also
necessary. Are any of the predicted or known miR-484 targets binding partners or regulators of
CYP2C19? It does not appear the CYP2C19 is a direct target of miR-484?
3) The cell culture was performed using neuroblastoma cells. Some discussion about the
limitations of this experiment/this cell line are necessary.
Minor concerns:
1) The sentence starting in line 116 is worded in a slightly confusing manner. When first
reading it sounds like two subsets were used for the gene expression study.
2) More information about the 64 samples used in the gene expression discovery cohort is
necessary. What diagnosis did these samples have? The larger familial cohort is described but not
the 64 individuals.
1) The sentence starting on line 116 is a bit confusing. It reads as if two subsets were used
for the gene expression studies.
2) Line 394 – can we really conclude that the NDE1 SNP drove gene expression changes by
miR-484? It seems likely, but more of the mechanism needs to be determined. Perhaps this
wording should be changed.
3) Only 6 out of 86 gene expression changes associate with the DISC1 network variants
were replicated. Some discussion about the ranking of these genes in the previous analysis would
be nice. Are these genes targets of miR-484?
4) Since the individuals in the medication study had a variety of mental illnesses- yet most
of them were schizophrenia - it isn’t clear which of the findings may be diagnosis-specific. It
would be great if the authors could parse this out a bit.

5) A figure at the end of the manuscript suggesting a model for how the NDE1 SNPs may

This study uses the ‘DISC1 network’ as a starting point. SNPs within the gene encoding the
DISC1 interactor NDE1 are reported to associate with gene expression changes in samples from
schizophrenia patients, and with medication use. A subset of the associated genes are targets of
miR-484 which is located within the 5’ UTR of the longest NDE1 isoform. The authors suggest
that the effects on gene expression and medication use are linked by miR-484 and provide
evidence that this is due to upregulation of CYP2C19 (which metabolizes the relevant
medications) by the microRNA. This is an interesting idea, but some improvements are required
to make the study suitable for publication by strengthening the link between miR-484 expression,
gene expression changes and medication effects.
It would be useful to provide a figure of the NDE1 gene showing positions of SNPs from the
original haplotype as well as those used for discovery and replication, LD blocks and the
microRNA in the 5’ UTR of one NDE1 isoform. The reader can then clearly see which SNPs are in
LD with each other. It would also be useful to know if the microRNA is transcribed from the
same strand as NDE1 because, if so, alterations in miR-484 expression could also correlate
directly with alterations in NDE1 expression. If not, can the microRNA also target NDE1
transcripts?
4
Gene expression changes were only found to be associated with one NDE1 SNP (rs2242549) in the
discovery sample, with two others (rs4781678 and rs1050162) showing no association. It is not
clear why the authors then state that rs1050162 is in LD with rs2242549, and that rs1050162 shows
association with gene expression changes in the discovery cohort, with the numbers stated in the
text not appearing in Table 1. Please clarify.
The associated genes are significantly enriched for predicted miR-484 targets. It would be useful
to know which genes these are.
The authors hypothesise a link between the NDE1 SNPs and effects upon microRNA expression.
This is an important point. Can the expression level of the microRNA be quantified in the RNA
samples used for microarray analysis to demonstrate a link between the SNP alleles and miR-484
expression?
Many of the western blots have multiple bands suggesting probing non-specificity. It should be
possible to get a clean band for actin and tubulin, if not all of the proteins. Which protein bands
were quantified and how was this done for actin which appears to have a non-specific band very
close to the actual band. It’s not clear what the 7-8 internal replicates used for western blot
quantification refers to. Unfortunately the blots presented are not very convincing and it would
be better to repeat this analysis with optimised antibody probing conditions.
In addition to western blotting it would also be appropriate to examine transcript expression
levels in response to the microRNA treatment.

This is a very interesting article that makes use of very unique longitudinal drug response data and
encourages progress in evaluating the multiplicative influence of different genetic factors on disease risk
and medication tolerance. The authors focus on the theory that DISC1 and its interacting partners may
collectively associate with risk for schizophrenia in some families. They previously identified an
association for NDE1, a DISC1 binding partner, with the disorder and focused this article on evaluating the
possible implications for NDE1 and its larger interacting network in schizophrenia and drug response in a
variety of disorders. They speculate that SNPs within the NDE1 locus alter the expression of miR-484 and
herefore the genes that it regulates. They suggest that miR-484 regulates CYP2C19 expression and
herefore impacts metabolism of drugs by this enzyme.
Major concerns:
1) Discussion about the possible mechanism of the NDE1 SNPs on miR-484 expression is necessary.
2) Discussion of the mechanism between CYP2C19 regulation with the NDE1 SNPs is also necessary.
Are any of the predicted or known miR-484 targets binding partners or regulators of CYP2C19? It does not
appear the CYP2C19 is a direct target of miR-484?
fully appreciate both of these comments and have debated ourselves about their inclusion in this work. We
ourselves in two minds about these requests. On the one hand we naturally would like to provide potential
lanations as to how the SNPs alter mir-484 expression and how in turn that regulates CYP2C19. Yet our
e pragmatic response is that such explanations would be purely speculative and thus could range from
er being totally correct or completely misleading. To that end we have tried to provide what the reviewer
uested whilst not being overly speculative. Those changes are as follows;
garding the mechanism by which SNPs in the NDE1 locus may affect expression of miR-484, it is
eworthy that miR-484 is transcribed from the same strand as NDE1, with both the microRNA and its
moter (60) being found within a 5’ untranslated exon of NDE1, which is included in some but not all NDE1
ce variants. It is therefore very likely that any event which affects either the expression or alternate splicing
DE1 would also impact upon miR-484 expression. That many of the SNPs of the NDE1 haplotypes are
nd in the 3’-most intron of NDE1 (Figure 2), which contains many motifs that regulate NDE1 splicing (61),
efore allows speculation that the SNPs could affect miR-484 expression indirectly through modulation of
E1 splicing events.”
Inserted at line 376 of the original manuscript, now from line 402 to line 410 of the revised manuscript.
e miRWalk database does not robustly predict either enzyme to be a target for mir-484, thus the mechanism
his action needs to be further investigated. The results from the cell culture assays clearly indicate, however,
mir-484 is capable of affecting the expression level of CYP2C19, suggesting that the mechanism through
ch the locus confers risk and alters medication usage could be the same. In spite of the lack of confident
diction, a direct effect of miR-484 on the CYP2C19 locus remains the simplest explanation for these
ervations, although indirect effects remain possible.”

lacing the sentence “This suggests that the mechanism through which the locus confers risk and alters
ication usage is the same.”
3) The cell culture was performed using neuroblastoma cells. Some discussion about the limitations of
his experiment/this cell line are necessary.
s is a good point made by the referee, as with the number of approaches we have used in this study many
ur potential readers will not have an in depth knowledge of cell based studies and their limits. To address
issue the following has been added to the discussion section:
is latter result was obtained from neuroblastoma cells. While such immortalized cells represent an atypical
etic environment, and some caution must be taken in directly applying them to in vivo situations, they
esent a useful tool to perform proof-of-principal experiments in a reductionist manner. Nevertheless, the
t promising explanation for the observations described here…”
Inserted at line 371 of the original manuscript, now from line 394 to 398 of the revised manuscript.
Minor concerns:
1) The sentence starting in line 116 is worded in a slightly confusing manner. When first reading it sounds
ike two subsets were used for the gene expression study.
s sentence has been clarified to make sure that these two sub cohorts are for distinct purposes. The changes
e are included with the following comment.
2) More information about the 64 samples used in the gene expression discovery cohort is necessary.
What diagnosis did these samples have? The larger familial cohort is described but not the 64 individuals.
have added the number of individuals who have been classified as affected in our studies using a broad
notype, including a breakdown using the criteria used to describe the larger family cohort. Thus the
vious two comments have resulted in the same section of the methods being changed to read as follows.
re, two sub-sets of this larger familial sample were used as discovery cohorts, firstly a sample of 18 families
individuals, 23 broadly affected; 15 with schizophrenia, three with schizoaffective disorder, three with
zophrenia spectrum diagnoses, and two with other mental illnesses; 41 unaffected family members) for
m RNA was available to study gene expression level changes, and secondly all 931 broadly affected
viduals were used to study medication use.”
From line 116 to 118 of the original manuscript, now from line 120 to 125 of the revised manuscript.
lacing the sentence, “Here, two sub-sets of this familial sample were used as a discovery cohort (18
ilies, N=64) to study gene expression level changes, and all affected individuals were used as a discovery
ort (N=931) to study medication use.”
2) Line 394 – can we really conclude that the NDE1 SNP drove gene expression changes by miR-484?
t seems likely, but more of the mechanism needs to be determined. Perhaps this wording should be
changed.
intention of this sentence is to imply that miR-484 drives the expression changes also in other mutations
he NDE1 locus, but that this is implicated by our SNP association data, not that the SNP drives the gene
ression changes. Thus we have changed this sentence to the following to clarify this.
vertheless, it can be speculated that the mechanism implicated here through SNP association, that miR-
drives large gene expression changes, could also be a consequence of the duplication of this locus.”
From line 392 to line 394 of the original manuscript, now from line 426 to line 428 of the revised
uscript. Replacing the sentence, “Nevertheless, it can be speculated that a consequence of the duplication
his locus would be gene expression levels changes driven by miR-484, as was seen here to be the case with
E1 SNP rs2242549.”
3) Only 6 out of 86 gene expression changes associate with the DISC1 network variants were replicated.
Some discussion about the ranking of these genes in the previous analysis would be nice. Are these genes
argets of miR-484?
are not entirely sure what the referee is specifically after with this comment, so we have addressed it in a
ber of ways. Firstly we amend the section in the introduction where this previous work is first mentioned,
ive additional background about how that study was performed. This now reads as follows:
e have previously studied the effect of DISC1 network genetic variation on gene expression in a small
30) publicly available population cohort of the CEU (Utah residents with North and Western European
estry) individuals. Using gene expression measured on the same individuals, by different laboratories, we
e able to observe 528 genes as being replicable in their differential expression across 24 variants studied,
hich 35 genes had pre-existing supporting evidence for a role in psychosis (30).”
From line 93 to 96 of the original manuscript, now from line 94 to line 99 of the revised manuscript.
lacing the sentence, “We have previously studied the effect of DISC1 network genetic variation on gene
ression in a publicly available population cohort of the CEU (Utah residents with North and Western
opean ancestry) individuals, with 528 genes being differentially expressed across 24 variants studied, of
ch 35 genes had pre-existing supporting evidence for a role in psychosis (30).”
clarify that the 86 gene expression changes are across three DISC1 network variants which could be
cifically tested here, and specify the numbers that could be replicated by those variants. Based on that we
highlight that the overlap of replication for the NDE1 SNP rs2242549 is 21%, replicating 6 out of 29
es. This is dealt with the first paragraph of the results section which now reads as follows;
our previous analysis of gene expression in association with DISC1 network variants using publicly
ilable data on the CEU (Utah residents with North and Western European ancestry) individuals, 86 genes
e found to be differentially expressed across the three DISC1 network variants that could be directly
icated here (DISC1 rs821616, 18 genes; NDE1 rs4781678, 39 genes; NDE1 rs2242549, 29 genes) (30). To
fy these results, made in a cohort of 30 individuals using technical replications, these three variants were
ed again, this time using the Finnish family cohort. In total, six of the gene expression changes previously
orted could be replicated, for the genes TRIOBP, ZNF500, KIAA1468, FCER1G, SULT1A1, and two probes
the ST3GAL5 gene. These were all in association with the status of the NDE1 gene locus (rs2242549). In
previous analysis, NDE1 rs2242549 associated with changes in gene expression levels of 29 genes, thus
e six genes represent a 21% overlap.”
From line 243 to 249 of the original manuscript, now from line 257 to line 267 of the revised
uscript. Replacing the paragraph, “In our previous analysis of gene expression in association with DISC1
work variants using publicly available data on the CEU (Utah residents with North and Western European
estry) individuals, 86 genes were found to be differentially expressed (30). To verify these results, five of
ants were tested again, this time using the Finnish family cohort. In total, six of the gene expression changes
viously reported could be replicated, for the genes TRIOBP, ZNF500, KIAA1468, FCER1G, SULT1A1, and
probes for the ST3GAL5 gene. These were all in association with the status of the NDE1 gene locus
242549).”
tly, the issue of which of these replicated genes are targets of mir-484 are specifically dealt with when we
e about the analysis of TRIOBP in the neuroblasoma cell lines. We specify that this is additionally because
a predicted target of mir-484. This is mentioned in the following sentences from the results;
nally, we also used the same system to investigate two proteins that are predicted targets of miR-484, each
hich illustrates a potential false negative in this study, possibly as a result of power limitations.”
From line 350 to line 351 of the original manuscript, now from line 373 to line 375 of the revised
uscript. Replacing the sentence, “Finally, we also used the same system to investigate two proteins, each
hich illustrates a potential false negative in this study, possibly as a result of power limitations.”
the discussion;
these previously identified 86 genes, we were able to replicate the observed changes in expression of six
es, including expression changes of two probes for ST3GAL5 and a probe for TRIOBP, the only one of
e genes to be a predicted target for miR-484. All of these were in association with the NDE1 SNP
42549, and represented a 21% overlap with the findings from prior study (30).”
From line 398 to 401 of the original manuscript, now from line 432 to line 436 of the revised
uscript. Replacing the sentence, “Of these previously identified 86 genes, we were able to replicate the
erved changes in expression of six genes, including expression changes of two probes for ST3GAL5 and a
be for TRIOBP, all of which were in association with the NDE1 SNP rs2242549.”
us, we verified our findings in a neuroblastoma cell culture model for two genes, which were predicted to
argets of miR-484, but provided inconsistent observations.”
From line 427 to 428 of the original manuscript, now from line 462 to 463 of the revised manuscript.
lacing the sentence, “Thus, we verified our observations in a neuroblastoma cell culture model for two
es that provided inconsistent observations.”
s can further be found by the addition of which genes are predicated targets for miR-484 to the Table S1,
equested by Referee 2.
4) Since the individuals in the medication study had a variety of mental illnesses- yet most of them were
chizophrenia - it isn’t clear which of the findings may be diagnosis-specific. It would be great if the
authors could parse this out a bit.
thank the referee for this interesting comment, we had worked under the assumption that these medications
have the same action regardless of diagnosis. Yet the referees comment highlights to us that other factors
ld interrupt the biological mechanism of the processes we are identifying here. This is epitomised by are
der dependent results. So there could also be other factors both influencing diagnosis and biological
hanisms involved in their treatment. Despite this, we, unfortunately, feel that we cannot comply with the
ree’s request. Although we have started with 931 affected individuals for whom we have prescription
ication data, not all of them have taken the same medications over the ten year period for which the data
collected, and we state in the manuscript that for statistical reliability we could only use specific
ications for which greater than 15 individuals had information, a massive reduction in sample size. This is
combined with the fact that we needed to separate those groups based on genotypes, for which we again
specific criteria, described in the manuscript, to make sure we have enough individuals in each grouping
nsue statistical reliability. Thus, to start further dividing these groups based on their diagnoses may begin
ake us beyond the numbers needed for statistical reliability.
5) A figure at the end of the manuscript suggesting a model for how the NDE1 SNPs may influence drug
esponse would be very helpful.
have now added this figure as requested and included in it a number of aspects also requested by the second
ree, however, as for the reasons stated above, we have made the figure deliberately open in how it
esents the miR-484 effect on CYP2C19 and therefore drug response. This figure is referred to throughout
text whenever appropriate and becomes Figure 2 in the revised manuscript, with other figures being
umbered accordingly.

This study uses the ‘DISC1 network’ as a starting point. SNPs within the gene encoding the DISC1
nteractor NDE1 are reported to associate with gene expression changes in samples from schizophrenia
patients, and with medication use. A subset of the associated genes are targets of miR-484 which is located
within the 5’ UTR of the longest NDE1 isoform. The authors suggest that the effects on gene expression
and medication use are linked by miR-484 and provide evidence that this is due to upregulation of
CYP2C19 (which metabolizes the relevant medications) by the microRNA. This is an interesting idea, but
ome improvements are required to make the study suitable for publication by strengthening the link
between miR-484 expression, gene expression changes and medication effects.
t would be useful to provide a figure of the NDE1 gene showing positions of SNPs from the original
haplotype as well as those used for discovery and replication, LD blocks and the microRNA in the 5’ UTR
of one NDE1 isoform. The reader can then clearly see which SNPs are in LD with each other. It would also
be useful to know if the microRNA is transcribed from the same strand as NDE1 because, if so, alterations
n miR-484 expression could also correlate directly with alterations in NDE1 expression. If not, can the
microRNA also target NDE1 transcripts?
have added this figure as requested including the LD block structure and the information also requested
he first referee. This figure is thus referred to throughout the text whenever appropriate and becomes Figure
the revised manuscript. The precise LD structure (both R2 and D’) between these SNPs in the whole
nish family cohort has been added as a new Figure S3. All other figures in the manuscript and
plementary material have been renumbered accordingly.
Gene expression changes were only found to be associated with one NDE1 SNP (rs2242549) in the
discovery sample, with two others (rs4781678 and rs1050162) showing no association. It is not clear why
he authors then state that rs1050162 is in LD with rs2242549, and that rs1050162 shows association with
gene expression changes in the discovery cohort, with the numbers stated in the text not appearing in Table
1. Please clarify.
confusion here is related to the fact that only the NDE1 SNP rs2242549 provided association to gene
ression level changes that were significant after applying the false discovery rate. All variants tested
vided evidence of association with gene expression changes prior to applying the false discovery rate. It is
latter list which has therefore been interrogated for supporting evidence for the probes identified by
42549. Using the SNP rs1050162 as an internal technical replicate of the findings with rs2242549 due to
fact that they are in high R2 LD. We have tried to clarify this in the text by making the amendments to the
owing sentences, and including illustrations of the LD pattern in figures as mentioned above. Furthermore,
his sentence we correct the fact that the text and table 1 quoted different numbers for this overlap, with the
ect numbers occurring in the text, and thus table 1 is amended accordingly.
stly we noted that although all variants tested are in high D’ linkage disequilibrium (LD) and thus tag the
erlying haplotype structure, only one SNP was in high R2 LD with rs2242549 (rs1050162, R2=0.88, n=1891
viduals genotyped at both loci; Figure S3, as determined using Haploview (52, 53)) and could therefore be
med to act as an internal replication of observations. Thus, within the discovery cohort, of the genes whose
ression levels were associated with rs2242549, 752 probes representing 695 genes were also significantly
ciated with rs1050162 prior to application of the false discovery rate (p=0.05).”
From line 266 to 271 of the original manuscript, now from line 284 to line 291 of the revised
uscript. Replacing the sentences, “Firstly, we noted that the NDE1 SNPs rs2242549 and rs1050162 were
igh linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the full family cohort (R2=0.88, n=1891 individuals genotyped at both
), and therefore can be assumed to act as an internal replication of observations. Thus, within the discovery
ort, of the genes whose expression levels were associated with rs2242549, 752 probes representing 695
es were also significantly associated with rs1050162 (p=0.05).”
The associated genes are significantly enriched for predicted miR-484 targets. It would be useful to know
which genes these are.
rder to provide this we have added a column to both parts of Table S1 marking those probes and genes
h the text “Target”, if they are predicted to be targeted by miR-484 by six or more programs as annotated
miRWalk. This is clarified in the table legend in the Supplementary Information document.
The authors hypothesise a link between the NDE1 SNPs and effects upon microRNA expression. This is
an important point. Can the expression level of the microRNA be quantified in the RNA samples used for
microarray analysis to demonstrate a link between the SNP alleles and miR-484 expression?
thank the author for this comment and agree that it is something that is of importance to test. However,

Many of the western blots have multiple bands suggesting probing non-specificity. It should be possible to
get a clean band for actin and tubulin, if not all of the proteins. Which protein bands were quantified and
how was this done for actin which appears to have a non-specific band very close to the actual band. It’s
not clear what the 7-8 internal replicates used for western blot quantification refers to. Unfortunately the

probing conditions.
re are multiple questions in this paragraph and thus we have broken it down in our response to aid
ification.

presence of a higher than ideal background signal is an artefact of looking at levels of lower expressed
ogenous proteins. Regarding the additional bands, TRIOBP and CYP2D6 are known to be expressed from
tiple transcripts as multiple different proteins species. The species at 72 kDa and 56 kDa, respectively,
e measured, as these have previously been described and are considered to be biologically relevant. In the
e of NDE1, the multiple bands are typical as the protein undergoes an unusually large number of protein
sphorylation events, therefore all of the bands from 40-45 kDa were pooled.
s is now stated in the materials and methods section, see the response below for details.
t should be possible to get a clean band for actin and tubulin, if not all of the proteins.
ulin is clean, while in the case of the actin image displayed, the non-specific band is “bleed through” from
evious antibody staining on the same membrane. Specificity of all bands was confirmed by first performing
condary antibody only” stainings, as stated in the materials and methods section, and only specific bands
e quantified.
we agree that the image used was not optimal, we have replaced it with an alternative showing a separate
of the same samples.
Which protein bands were quantified and how was this done for actin which appears to have a non-specific
band very close to the actual band.
Western blot images were obtained using a LI-COR Odyssey imaging system. Individual bands of interest
e then isolated and quantified using its associated software. This section of the material and methods section
been revised, both to make this clearer and to provide more information on which bands were analysed
above):
Dye secondary antibodies were used (LI-COR) and the signal visualized using an Odyssey CLx infrared
ging system (LI-COR). Protein bands of interest were then isolated and quantified using Image Studio
ware (LI-COR). In the case of TRIOBP and CYP2D6, which are each encoded for by multiple splice
ants (46-48), the species at 72 kDa and 56 kDa respectively were selected for analysis as they are known
e biologically active (49, 50). In the case of NDE1, all of the bands between 40 kDa and 45 kDa, which
consistent with its large number of known phosphorylation events (51), were measured and pooled. All
mbranes were probed with secondary antibodies alone first to ensure specificity of signal.”
From line 234 to 237 of the original manuscript, now from line 242 to line 249 of the revised
uscript. Replacing the sentences, “IRDye secondary antibodies were used (LI-COR) and the signal

garding protein sizes, please also note that in our original submission, the 50 kDa band in several blots was

t’s not clear what the 7-8 internal replicates used for western blot quantification refers to.
clarification, both technical and biological replications were performed. From each batch of neuroblastoma
s, eight sets of cells were treated with miR-484 mimic and eight with the negative control mRNA. After
stern blotting of these 16 samples, the mean level of each protein was calculated from these “technical” or
ernal” replicates.
s represented one experiment. Two further identical experiments were then performed on different days
using freshly prepared reagents and different batches of cells, each containing 8 internal/technical
icates for each of miR484 and the negative control. These three experiments were the “biological”
icates and were used to perform statistics.
8” refers to the fact that in one experiment, a sample was lost, and therefore the experiment only included
chnical replicates rather than the intended 8.
s line in the materials & methods section has been revised to read:
ean fold-changes between the control and miR-484-treated samples were calculated from 7-8 technical
icates, performed from the same batch of cells. Three independent experiments of this type were then
ormed for biological replication, and the results compared by two-tailed paired Student’s t-test.”
From line 237 to 240 of the original manuscript, now from line 250 to 253 of the revised manuscript.
lacing the sentences, “Mean fold-changes between the control and miR-484-treated samples were
ulated from 7-8 internal replicates. Three independent experiments were performed and the results
pared by two-tailed paired Student’s t-test.”
Unfortunately the blots presented are not very convincing and it would be better to repeat this analysis with
optimised antibody probing conditions.
politely disagree with this comment. While assaying levels of endogenous protein, particularly when lower
ressed, can be challenging, it was for this reason that we elected to include so many technical replicates, in
er to negate any inaccuracies due to the background. Please see our response above for detailed explanations
extra” bands in the blots.
n addition to western blotting it would also be appropriate to examine transcript expression levels in
esponse to the microRNA treatment.
thank the reviewer for this suggestion. While we believe that a downstream effect of the miR-484 mimic
protein levels is sufficient to demonstrate the proof-of-principal that CYP2C19 is regulated by miR-484,
agree that ideally demonstration at the transcript level would complement this result. Unfortunately, this is
easily practical for us at the moment as the author responsible for the cell culture tests (Dr. Bradshaw) has
ntly moved institution. The following line has therefore been added to the discussion section:
at the levels of these proteins are altered, in a manner that closely matches to the pharmacogenetic data,
ngly implies that miR-484 influences the expression of CYP2C19, but not CYP2D6, transcripts, although
itional data at the transcript level would be required to confirm this.”
