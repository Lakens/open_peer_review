• It is important in the introduction to have a statement/discussion on why this particular
method is needed/useful. Why is it important to culture GCPs/MBs? Why do we need an
improved way to culture them? What is better about this method compared to other methods?
This will greatly help orient the non-expert reader.
• The author often uses “which”, when “that” is more appropriate. Lines 37, 46, 107, 111, 117,
121, 127, 134, etc (many more).
• Need consistency in gene names and mouse line names. Gene names should be italicized –
human genes in all capitals, mouse genes with only the first letter capitalized. Mouse strain
names should follow the mouse genotype naming convention (e.g., Atoh1-Cre;Ptch1-fl/fl).
• Need a better description (methods and/or text and/or figure legends) of the time points at
which experiments were performed. How long were spheres cultured before collecting
RNA/protein? How long were spheres treated with vismodegib?
• Fig. 2 b and c descriptions are switched in the figure legend.
• Can the author discuss why Nestin and Sox2 are expressed at lower levels in SAG-treated cells
compared to mEF cells?
• Fig. 3d – Is there really no statistically significant differences between mSS and mPS? Graph
makes it look very different for most of the genes tested.
• Methods for Fig. 4 are not well described. Was SAG removed before treatment with
cyclopamine or vismodegib? Or were they added to SAG treatment? How long were they treated
before qPCR or sphere counting or Western blot?
• It is impossible to see morphologies being described in Fig. 5a. Higher magnification images
would be useful.
• More markers of granule cell lineage (Fig. 3 and Fig. 5) are required to convincingly show that
mSS cells are more similar in identity to endogenous GCPs and GCNs, compared to mEF cells.
3
The main conclusion is that this culture method is a better recapitulation of normal development
and lineage than other existing culture methods – this conclusion would be much stronger with
this further data. Some possible markers to analyze would be Meis1, Zic2, Pax6, Pax2, Cyclin D2,
NeuroD.

Comments to the Author
In this manuscript, the Author defines a novel method to immortalize non-transformed cerebellar
Granule Cell Progenitors (GCPs), obtained by normal neonatal murine cerebella, and
representing the cells from which the SHH-dependent medulloblastoma subtype originates.
The manuscript is well written and the method proposed is supported by a wide panel of results,
well-designed and presented. Although the literature in this research field is extensive, the
methodology proposed by Dr Heil is very useful for the resolution of technical limitations related
to the maintenance of primary cells in culture, with a relevant impact from the ethical point of
view.
Specific comments:
• Being the manuscript to consider as a methodology paper, it is opinion of this Reviewer that it

is important to provide the user with a well-defined and ready-to-use protocol, implemented
with important information (i.e., number of mice to use, number of cells, how GCPs were isolated
and so on…). This protocol should be part of the main text and not confined into the M&M
section.

Appendix B
Dear Reviewers,
many thanks for your detailed and constructive feedback which certainly improved my manuscript.
This document, I detail the changes that I made to my manuscript: „Hedgehog pathway permissive
culture conditions allow for establishment of immortal cell lines from granule lineage cells derived
from cancerous as well as non-cancerous cerebellum”.
Again, let me express my sincerest thanks you for your time and effort to evaluate my paper and
have modified the work according to your suggestions and comments–the manuscript is now greatly
improved.
In the following, I offer a step-by-step response to each of the points raised by the referees. More
precisely, this document will recap the referee’s comments, each followed by the response, in
italics.
Comments to Reviewer #1
Comments to the Author(s)
• It is important in the introduction to have a statement/discussion on why this particular method
is needed/useful. Why is it important to culture GCPs/MBs? Why do we need an improved way to
culture them? What is better about this method compared to other methods? This will greatly help
orient the non-expert reader.
The discussion of the method’s location in the field has been detailed both in the
introduction (line 125) and discussion (line 439) sections of the manuscript.
In addition, I broadened and deepened the motivation as to why an improved way is
needed.
Also, the rewriting should facilitate access for both prospective audiences.
• The author often uses “which”, when “that” is more appropriate. Lines 37, 46, 107, 111, 117,
121, 127, 134, etc (many more).
These mistakes have been corrected.
• Need consistency in gene names and mouse line names. Gene names should be italicized –
human genes in all capitals, mouse genes with only the first letter capitalized. Mouse strain names
should follow the mouse genotype naming convention (e.g., Atoh1-Cre;Ptch1-fl/fl).
Worked to make the text more consistent throughout. That is, mouse strains have been
named by application of MGI criteria. Genes have been named as by MGI standards,
italicized with first letter upper-case for mouse genes. Proteins are unitalicized upper case.
Hope that you agree that the paper is now more readable.
• Need a better description (methods and/or text and/or figure legends) of the time points at
which experiments were performed. How long were spheres cultured before collecting
RNA/protein? How long were spheres treated with vismodegib?
Worked on improving the writing as to the communication of timing. Thus, all results have
been modified as to explicitly describe experimental times.
• Fig. 2 b and c descriptions are switched in the figure legend.
Please excuse the mistake, this has been corrected.
• Can the author discuss why Nestin and Sox2 are expressed at lower levels in SAG-treated cells
compared to mEF cells?
The justification has been fine-tuned and is discussed in detail in the discussion section
(line 362).
• Fig. 3d – Is there really no statistically significant differences between mSS and mPS? Graph
makes it look very different for most of the genes tested.
To improve the statistics of the experiment shown in figure 3d an additional set of samples
has been added to the analysis.
With this new data, the differences between mSS and mPS cells become significant for the
genes Gli2 and Nmyc, while remaining non-significant for the other ones. I interpret this
as a difference in the magnitude of SHH signaling caused by either pharmacological or
genetic activation of the pathway. Let me take the liberty to note that this interpretation is
consistent with the differences in expression being in members of the signaling pathway
itself, as apposed to the lineage markers, such as Atoh1 or Pax6.
• Methods for Fig. 4 are not well described. Was SAG removed before treatment with
cyclopamine or vismodegib? Or were they added to SAG treatment? How long were they treated
before qPCR or sphere counting or Western blot?
The experimental setup is now described in more detail, providing more information on the
experimental setup (line 295).
• It is impossible to see morphologies being described in Fig. 5a. Higher magnification images
would be useful.
Figure 5a has been recomposed so as to put better emphasis on the different morphologies
between the cell populations.
• More markers of granule cell lineage (Fig. 3 and Fig. 5) are required to convincingly show that
mSS cells are more similar in identity to endogenous GCPs and GCNs, compared to mEF cells. The
main conclusion is that this culture method is a better recapitulation of normal development and
lineage than other existing culture methods – this conclusion would be much stronger with this
further data. Some possible markers to analyze would be Meis1, Zic2, Pax6, Pax2, Cyclin D2,
NeuroD.
The markers Pax6 and Ccnd2 have been added to figure 3.

The funding hyperlink was carried over from versions of the manuscript written
previously. The hyperlink has been replaced with a link to the doctoral program, which
hosted this project. Unfortunately, these things were beyond my control
