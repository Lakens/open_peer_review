Comments:
1. What is indicated in Figure 2B - trajectories of a single cell? Include this information in the
figure legend. It would be good to mark cell division events on these plots - which is intuitive
when looking at the "Cells size" plot, but not when looking at the "mRNA number" plot.
Figure 7B - here are also indicated trajectories of a single cell?
2. Page 23, line 402: What would be an explanation / biological interpretation why only MglB
"behaves like a P protein", and PtsG does not? The Figure S6 legend indicates that PtsG behaves
like an R protein. However, both proteins belong to the same functional class - glucose transport
systems. Perhaps different underlying regulatory networks contribute to this behaviour?
Minor:
- page 2, line 26 - persister cells, not persistor cells
- page 13, line 268 - "contribution" written twice
- page 31, line 575 - what is cf in "(cf Supplemental Figure 4)"?
- Protein symbols are not italicized, and the first letter is upper-case:
page 23, line 402: MglB;
the legend of Figure S6: MglB and PtsG are transporters, and RpsM is a ribosomal protein.
- Gene symbols are composed of italicized letters:

1. What is indicated in Figure 2B - trajectories of a single cell? Include this
information in the figure legend. It would be good to mark cell division events
on these plots - which is intuitive when looking at the "Cells size" plot, but not
when looking at the "mRNA number" plot.
Figure 7B - here are also indicated trajectories of a single cell?
We agree with the reviewer and have updated Figure 2B and the legends of
Figure 2B and 7B accordingly.
2. Page 23, line 402: What would be an explanation / biological interpretation
why only MglB "behaves like a P protein", and PtsG does not? The Figure S6
legend indicates that PtsG behaves like an R protein. However, both proteins
belong to the same functional class - glucose transport systems. Perhaps
different underlying regulatory networks contribute to this behaviour?
We agree with the reviewer that the different behavior of the ptsG and mglB
promoters across conditions is interesting, given the protein they encode
belong to the same functional class. As noted in the introduction of Nikolic et
al. (2013), it is known that the two corresponding transport systems (PtsG/Crr
and MglABC) are submitted to substantially different regulations, involving
different groups of sigma factors, activators and repressors at the level of
transcription, and a small RNA as well controlling degradation of the ptsG
transcript (the latter regulation being absent by construction in the promoter-
GFP reporter system). Based on these regulatory differences, the distinct
expression patterns are somewhat expected. However, the biological function
of such distinct regulations seems to be still unclear. One can speculate that
differences in specificity, affinity, and efficiency of the two systems make them
useful in environmental circumstances that do not completely overlap. We
added a sentence in the legend of Figure S6 discussing this point.
Minor:

- Gene symbols are composed of italicized letters:

We thank the reviewer for reporting these issues that we have corrected.
