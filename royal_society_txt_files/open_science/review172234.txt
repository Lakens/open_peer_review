Comments:
1. What is indicated in Figure 2B - trajectories of a single cell? Include this information in the
figure legend. It would be good to mark cell division events on these plots - which is intuitive
when looking at the "Cells size" plot, but not when looking at the "mRNA number" plot.
Figure 7B - here are also indicated trajectories of a single cell?
2. Page 23, line 402: What would be an explanation / biological interpretation why only MglB
"behaves like a P protein", and PtsG does not? The Figure S6 legend indicates that PtsG behaves
like an R protein. However, both proteins belong to the same functional class - glucose transport
systems. Perhaps different underlying regulatory networks contribute to this behaviour?
Minor:
- page 2, line 26 - persister cells, not persistor cells
- page 13, line 268 - "contribution" written twice
- page 31, line 575 - what is cf in "(cf Supplemental Figure 4)"?
- Protein symbols are not italicized, and the first letter is upper-case:
page 23, line 402: MglB;
the legend of Figure S6: MglB and PtsG are transporters, and RpsM is a ribosomal protein.
- Gene symbols are composed of italicized letters:

heading is not relevant to your paper, please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state
that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 14-Feb-2018). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.

When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science will introduce article processing charges for all new
submissions received from 1 January 2018. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to Royal
Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers submitted
as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication after 1 Jan 2018,
you will be asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is
approved by Royal Society Publishing. Manuscripts originally submitted prior to 1 Jan 2018 will
not subject to a charge, even if they are accepted in 2018. You can find out more about the charges
at http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please
contact openscience@royalsociety.org.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look

1. What is indicated in Figure 2B - trajectories of a single cell? Include this
information in the figure legend. It would be good to mark cell division events
on these plots - which is intuitive when looking at the "Cells size" plot, but not
when looking at the "mRNA number" plot.
Figure 7B - here are also indicated trajectories of a single cell?
We agree with the reviewer and have updated Figure 2B and the legends of
Figure 2B and 7B accordingly.
2. Page 23, line 402: What would be an explanation / biological interpretation
why only MglB "behaves like a P protein", and PtsG does not? The Figure S6
legend indicates that PtsG behaves like an R protein. However, both proteins
belong to the same functional class - glucose transport systems. Perhaps
different underlying regulatory networks contribute to this behaviour?
We agree with the reviewer that the different behavior of the ptsG and mglB
promoters across conditions is interesting, given the protein they encode
belong to the same functional class. As noted in the introduction of Nikolic et
al. (2013), it is known that the two corresponding transport systems (PtsG/Crr
and MglABC) are submitted to substantially different regulations, involving
different groups of sigma factors, activators and repressors at the level of
transcription, and a small RNA as well controlling degradation of the ptsG
transcript (the latter regulation being absent by construction in the promoter-
GFP reporter system). Based on these regulatory differences, the distinct
expression patterns are somewhat expected. However, the biological function
of such distinct regulations seems to be still unclear. One can speculate that
differences in specificity, affinity, and efficiency of the two systems make them
useful in environmental circumstances that do not completely overlap. We
added a sentence in the legend of Figure S6 discussing this point.
Minor:

- Protein symbols are not italicized, and the first letter is upper-case:
page 23, line 402: MglB;
the legend of Figure S6: MglB and PtsG are transporters, and RpsM is a
ribosomal protein.
- Gene symbols are composed of italicized letters:
page 24, line 406: <i> mreB </i> mutants
We thank the reviewer for reporting these issues that we have corrected.
