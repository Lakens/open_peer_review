In this manuscript, the authors prepared composite superhydrophobic coatings based on
fluorosilicone resin and modified nanoparticles, and further investigated the effect of process and
filler contents on structure and wettability of composite coating. Although some results look
interesting, this manuscript should be major revised before considered for publication as follows:
1. There have been reported quite some superhydrophobic coatings, e.g., J. Mater. Chem. 2011, 21,
6161; Adv. Funct. Mater.2015, 25, 1035; Adv. Mater. 2012 , 24 , 2409; ACS Nano 2015, 9, 12513,
which should help the authors polish their manuscript.
2. In Page 7, Fig. 3 should be Fig. 2.
3. Abstract and conclusion should be rewritten. Abstract mainly focuses the background, your
idea and the main results; Conclusion should be summarized what people can learn from this
study, compared previous methods, theory, results, etc.

This manuscript focuses on composite superhydrophobic coatings based on fluorosilicone resin
and modified nano particles and it would deserve publication with minor revision.
1. Leave two blank spaces at the beginning of each paragraph. For example line 48 of page 4.
2. The unit is unclear of line 29 of page 4.
3. It should be "wear" instead of "Wear" i line 28 of page 10.
4. The peaks of original SiO2 should be indexed in Fig. 6(a) as (b).
5. There should be a blank between "and" and "fsolid" in line 30 of page 14.

This paper studied the FSi resin coating on the modified silica served as Superhydrophobic
performance via comparing the contact angle and sliding angle, discussing the influence of ratio
of components and reaction(dispersion) time.My specific comments are listed as follows.
1. The author should provide the experimental evidence to explain how the combination
mechanism of fluorosilicone resin and nanoparticles overcome the weak linkage which results in
improving of the weariness performance. (In abstract and Fig.13)
2. The author should provide sufficient original data and statistical images. (In Fig.1)
3. There is no figure notes of insets in Fig.2-4, the author should pay close attention to figure note.
4. It’s not convincing that the FSi resin has a flat morphology because of the high voltage of the
SEM. (Fig.2)
5. The author should supplement the particle size statistics to explain the influence of thickness of
FSi coating or aggregation state of the modify silica. (Fig.3)
6. The author should supplement the SEM image after friction to indicate whether the
smoothness drop affects wear performance. (Fig.5)

Comment 1: Leave two blank spaces at the beginning of each paragraph. For example,
line 48 of page 4.
Reply: Thanks for the comment. See revised version.
Comment 2: The unit is unclear of line 29 of page 4.
Reply: Thanks for the comment. The unit is <U+F0B0>C and it has been added in the revised
manuscript.
Comment 3: It should be "wear" instead of "Wear" line 28 of page 10.
Reply: Thanks for the comment. We have corrected this spelling mistake in the revised
manuscript.
Comment 4: The peaks of original SiO2 should be indexed in Fig. 6(a) as (b).
Reply: Thanks for the comment. The peaks of original SiO2 at 3447 cm-1 and 1632 cm-
1
represent the hydroxyls, and the peak at 1100 cm-1 represents silicon hydride bonds.
They have been indexed in Fig. 7(a) in the revised manuscript.
Comment 5: There should be a blank between "and" and "fsolid" in line 30 of page 14.
Reply: Thanks for the comment. A blank has been added between "and" and "fsolid"

This paper studied the FSi resin coating on the modified silica served as
Superhydrophobic performance via comparing the contact angle and sliding angle,
discussing the influence of ratio of components and reaction(dispersion) time. My
specific comments are listed as follows.
Comment 1: The author should provide the experimental evidence to explain how the
combination mechanism of fluorosilicone resin and nanoparticles overcome the weak
linkage which results in improving of the weariness performance. (In abstract and
Fig.13)
Reply: Thanks for the comment. We have supplement the DSC data of FSi resin,
D15C25 and D120C25 in Fig. 14 in the revised version to verify that interpenetrating
function was existed between fluorosilicone resin and nanoparticles.
Comment 2: The author should provide sufficient original data and statistical images.
(In Fig.1)
Reply: Thanks for the comment. Fig. 1 displayed the CA and SA values of coatings
with (a) three dispersion time, and (b) different silica content. They were measured with
OCA-20 at three different places in the same sample. The original data have been
deposited in an external repository:
http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.8v3hv5k. Average CA and SA
values were calculated and depicted in Fig.1 with error bar.
Comment 3: There is no figure notes of insets in Fig.2-4, the author should pay close
attention to figure note.
Reply: Thanks for the comment. We have supplemented the figure notes of insets in
Fig. 1-3,5 in the revised manuscript.
Comment 4: It’s not convincing that the FSi resin has a flat morphology because of
the high voltage of the SEM. (Fig.2)
Reply: Thanks for the comment. AFM was used to characterize the morphology of FSi
resin and the result was exhibited in Fig.2. By analyzing the AFM image of FSi resin,
we find the roughness was at nano meter level.
Comment 5: The author should supplement the particle size statistics to explain the
influence of thickness of FSi coating or aggregation state of the modify silica. (Fig.3)
Reply: Thanks for the comment. The results of particle statics were presented in Fig.4
in revised manuscript.
Comment 6: The author should supplement the SEM image after friction to indicate
whether the smoothness drop affects wear performance. (Fig.5)
Reply: Thanks for the comment. The cross-section SEM images of coatings before and
after abrasion test have been inserted in Fig 6(f, g) in revised version. The surface of
the composite coating is coarse with many bulges before abrasion. After abrasion test,
the surface become flatter. The original thickness of the coating is about 37 µm, and
become about 35 µm after abrasion test. The thickness of the coating does not reduce
sharply after abrasion test. which may indicate that the abrasion did not affect its wear
performance of coating.
