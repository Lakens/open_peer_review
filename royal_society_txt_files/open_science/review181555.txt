This paper reported a single experiment in which a total of 561 undergraduate students rated the
valence of sound stimuli including human crying, cats' meows, and dogs' whines or whimpers.
The participants were divided into four groups according to the current pet-owner status. The
major findings were that those who owned pets gave more negative ratings to dog whines than
those who did not own pets and that those who owned cats only gave more negative ratings to
cats' distress vocalization. There was no personality difference between cat and dog owners.
I have read the paper with interest. For full disclosure, I don't like dogs or cats very much and I
don't own either. In a recent online survey conducted in Japan, about 20% of Japanese people
(1,000 respondents from their 20's to 60's) answered that they did not like either dogs or cats
(https://www.cross-m.co.jp/news/release/20180425.html; in Japanese).
Nevertheless, I agree that the idea that the experience of interacting with pet animals increases
the ability to detect distress vocalization of pet animals is reasonable and worth examining
empirically.
I have one major concern and several minor questions and requests.
The most serious concern is why those who owned both cats and dogs did not show the tendency
similar to those who owned cats alone, the latter of which (n = 31) the authors argued was
somehow special. In my reading, I could not find the answer to this question.
A related question is why cat-alone owners had a good ability to detect distress vocalization of
dogs, which they did not own and had less daily experience with. If pet owners are more
sensitive to negative emotion in their pets and this ability is learned from interaction with them,
the ability seems to be specific to the species that they own.
An alternative explanation is that those who own pets are originally sensitive to animals' internal
states because they care for animals. This explains all the results except the cat-only owners'
response to cat meows. However, as I argued above, the reason why the effect of owning cats
disappeared when they had dogs at the same time is unclear. The authors may want to discuss
this issue.
Minor points
1. Hypotheses. At the end of the Introduction, only a few hypotheses are listed. It would be nice
to organize all the hypotheses to be tested here. In connection to this, the last sentence "We also
hypothesized that cat owners would show greater anxiety and depression symptoms compared
to dog owners and adults with no pets" appears suddenly. How central is this hypothesis, which
is eventually rejected, to the authors' purpose in this study?
2. Sample size. Please add some comments to rationalize this sample size.
3. Stimuli. On page 6, it is unclear how many sounds were used per category. Please specify.
3
4. Procedure: Were headphones used for sound presentation? Please give some explanation?
about how the sound intensity was adjusted.
5. Citation. On page 3, the reference number (7) of the AVMA report looks odd.
If my major question is resolved, I would be happy to support the publication of this paper.

Dear authors,
I carefully read your article submitted to Royal Society of Open Science « Pawsitively sad : Pet-
owners are more sensitive to negative emotion in animal distress vocalisations ».
The topic of the article suits well the scope of the journal, and it reports new results in the field of
the cross-species interpretation of acoustic signals. However, I have concerns on its writing, and I
raised questions you should answer before considering its publication.
Introduction
It is appreciated to have a societal background and the history of the topic, that explains why the
question in meaningful. However, we miss information on the specificity of human perception of
animal sounds. Human are able to recognize the valence and intensity of sounds from many
animals, domesticated or not, so this would be nice to have a paragraph which reports this, and
explain the specific interest of working on dog and cat sounds.
Also, the intensity of the emotion modifies the acoustic parameters of the sounds, and you never
mention this, as you focus on valence. How can you be sure intensity did not interfere in the
evaluation process?
Minor edits: 3rd paragraph, remove all the unnecessary “(7)”
5th paragraph: add a point in the end
4
Method
The method is not enough detailed to my mind. This is the weak part of the article. I have several
questions:
• How did you select the 561 participants among the 945 of the larger study?
• How is the racial/ethnic background important for the study? If you had expectations, please
report them in the introduction, and include this in the statistics.
• Did you ask people for the breed they owned? There are house cats and cats that rather spend
their days outside, how could it affect the vocal expression? And thus evaluation.
how long had the particpants been a owner?
• Why are the ECR results not shown in Table 1 ? Is 3.96 a high score? Please be homogeneous
for the three types of psycho tests. In addition you should move these data (and the
corresponding text) to the results part, and probably merging table 1 and 2 would be a good
option).
• We need information about the situations of the records, as you mention in the discussion there
are several situations in the OxVoc database. Is the vocal expression similar/close among all the
situations? “distress” may be express in a large range of situations, how did this affect the
results? Did you calculate it?
• Did you use sounds from adult or young animals?
• How many sounds did people evaluate?
• How did you scale the volume? Which is highly related to intensity and valence.
• Please add a “statistical analyses” part so that we have an overview on the statistics rather than
having information spread into the results
Results
• You report no gender effect on ratings, but you did not report the interaction you included in
the statistical model (gender * ownership at least)
• my major concern here is that you do not know the valence of the situations: dog whines are
rated as more negative than cat meows, but how is it in reality? If the situations were of different
valence (excluding inter-animals variability), how can you compare evaluations from different
people? I might be confused by the fact that the method lack of details, but how can you control
this?
• “dogs whines are particularly distressing”, this sentence, and other similar sentences, is untrue.
You did not evaluate the distressing impact of the sounds. This raises the question of how you
asked people to do the task. Did you ask them how distressful are the sounds? Or how
negative/positive is the situation for the animal vocalizing?
• The comparison with human cries should probably be removed, as you do not explain how you
did this. What it with the same people? The same volume? In the same room? The condition of
the evaluation may impact the evaluation, so this seems to be very dangerous to make
comparison between studies, or including results from another study.
• “no difference in cat owner’s…” once again I am not convinced the use of other sounds
evaluated elsewhere is suitable here.
Discussion
Do you think other parameters than the pitch may explain the differences in evaluation?
The explanation of the difference between dog and cat sounds may be sufficient, but information
on the breeds you compared would improve a lot the discussion part. There is probably a huge
variability between dog species, between cat species too, and not only between cats and dogs.
I hope these report will help you in the process of publishing the article.

Review of Parsons et al RSOS Pawsitively sad
This is a well-designed study addressing an interesting and important question. The paper is well
organized and easy to read. The results are presented in sufficient detail, including the effect sizes
and Fig 1 captures the main effects in a concise way. The conclusions are firmly based in the
results.
Nevertheless, I have a few comments on Introduction, on the presentation of the results and the
interpretation of the results in the Discussion.
1. It is unclear why the aspects of social-dominance, competitiveness and political conservativism
aspect is exposed in quite some detail in the Introduction (page 3, lines 20-31) as these aspects are
then never mentioned later in the paper.
2. Page 4, lines 16-18. When referring to the Pongracz et al 2005 paper, the authors state that
“(human) adults can accurately guess the context … and correctly infer whether the dog was
aggressive, fearful or playful”. This is an overstatement, as the listeners in that study were above
chance in guessing the context but by far not totally accurate (see Fig 6 in the cited paper), and
inference about one of the three types of situations (Aggressive, fearful, playful) was correct in
about 2/3 of the cases (see data in Table 5 in the cited study).
3. Page 3, lines 39-50, plus the whole section of Results and Discussion. All in all, there were five
types of relationships examined in the study: A. Pet ownership <-> psychological properties; B.
Psychological properties <-> sound rating; C. Pet ownership <-> sound rating; D. Species of the
vocalizing animal <-> sound rating; E. acoustic properties of the calls <-> sound rating. However,
this is not very transparent from the paper. For instance, only relationships A., C. and D. are
mentioned in the paragraph on p 4 lines 39-50 where the aims of the study are outlined. In the
Results, these five types of relationship are not always clearly identified and sometimes, they are
mentioned in two separate locations in the text, e.g. the effect B on p 6 l 41-43 and on p 7 lines 17-
20. Also, some of the results are missing: for instance, it is not reported wether Anxiety measure
affected sound rating (effect B for GADQ). There is a need to organize this very systematically in
the paper, otherwise it is difficult for the reader to keep track of questions results and
interpretation. I also suggest that these 5 types of relationships are dealt with in the same order in
all the sections of the manuscript (Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion), as far as possible.
6
4. Page 5, Table 1. How did the proportions of participants that were above the cut-off scores of
EDS-5 and GAD-Q (77.4% and 88.2%) compare to the US general population? This might be
important because UCLA undergraduate psychology students might differ from the general
population. This applies to other variables and questions in the study. For instance, UCLA
psychology students are probably politically non-conservative, so could it be that the dog-owners
in this study are not really representative of the US dog owners in general? (See point 1.). Also,
the participants were very young and probably lived in small households. Age and household
size may influence some of the variables examined in the study substantially, e.g. (1, 2). Would
the results be the same with people of different age and social strata? I do not propose that the
authors engage on extensive speculations about what other factors that were not investigated
might have effects on psychological profiles of dog and cat owners. Nevertheless, it would be
appropriate to mention in the discussion that the participants in the study were a particular
subset of the human population and that dog / cat owners / non-owners from different strata of
the population might have different characteristics and the results of the current study may not
be generalizable to them, and mention specifically some of the possible differences, based on the
available data from other studies.
5. It is very good that effect sizes are reported for all the results. Nevertheless, there seems to be a
certain bias in interpreting these effect sizes. Specifically, a lot of attention in the paper is devoted
to the interaction between pet-owning status and animal species being rated (e.g., abstract lines
16-17, first paragraph of the discussion, Conclusion). However, the effect size for this interaction
is very small (eta squared = 0.01, p 7 lines 32-33) and is 50 times smaller than the effect size of the
animal being rated (eta squared = 0.51, p 7 lines 30-31). Also the pet-owning status effect is small
(eta squared = 0.04, p 7 lines 31-32). For other types of effect, the small size of the effect is clearly
stated and discussed (e.g., p. 3 lins 21-22, p. 11 lines 14-15) but for “main” results of the study, the
authors are silent about their small effect sizes. I agreed it is interesting that cat-only owners were
more sensitive to cat meows than other groups but it needs to be conveyed clearly and
prominently to the reader that this effect explained only 1% of the total variability in the sound
rating.
6. Cat-and-dog owners seem to be similar to dog-only owners, but less so to cat-only owners. This
result is not discussed in the paper.
7. Page 10 lines 33-35. This explanation lacks internal logic. The fact that ALL participants found
the dog whines particularly plaintive cannot be explained by the fact that DOG OWNERS have a
greater tendency to anthropomorphize.
8. I found the raw data, but not the code of the statistical evaluation, on the data depository.
In conclusion, I recommend a minor revision of the paper before it will be accepted for
publication in RSOS.

The topic of the article suits well the scope of the journal, and it reports new results in the field of
the cross-species interpretation of acoustic signals. However, I have concerns on its writing, and I

Method
The method is not enough detailed to my mind. This is the weak part of the article. I have several
questions:
• How did you select the 561 participants among the 945 of the larger study?
• How is the racial/ethnic background important for the study? If you had expectations, please
report them in the introduction, and include this in the statistics.
• Did you ask people for the breed they owned? There are house cats and cats that rather spend
their days outside, how could it affect the vocal expression? And thus evaluation.
how long had the particpants been a owner?
• Why are the ECR results not shown in Table 1 ? Is 3.96 a high score? Please be homogeneous
for the three types of psycho tests. In addition you should move these data (and the
corresponding text) to the results part, and probably merging table 1 and 2 would be a good
option).
• We need information about the situations of the records, as you mention in the discussion there

• How many sounds did people evaluate?
• How did you scale the volume? Which is highly related to intensity and valence.
• Please add a “statistical analyses” part so that we have an overview on the statistics rather than
having information spread into the results
Results
• You report no gender effect on ratings, but you did not report the interaction you included in
the statistical model (gender * ownership at least)
• my major concern here is that you do not know the valence of the situations: dog whines are
rated as more negative than cat meows, but how is it in reality? If the situations were of different
valence (excluding inter-animals variability), how can you compare evaluations from different
people? I might be confused by the fact that the method lack of details, but how can you control
this?
• “dogs whines are particularly distressing”, this sentence, and other similar sentences, is untrue.
You did not evaluate the distressing impact of the sounds. This raises the question of how you
asked people to do the task. Did you ask them how distressful are the sounds? Or how
negative/positive is the situation for the animal vocalizing?
• The comparison with human cries should probably be removed, as you do not explain how you
did this. What it with the same people? The same volume? In the same room? The condition of
11
the evaluation may impact the evaluation, so this seems to be very dangerous to make
comparison between studies, or including results from another study.
• “no difference in cat owner’s…” once again I am not convinced the use of other sounds
evaluated elsewhere is suitable here.
Discussion
Do you think other parameters than the pitch may explain the differences in evaluation?
The explanation of the difference between dog and cat sounds may be sufficient, but information
on the breeds you compared would improve a lot the discussion part. There is probably a huge
variability between dog species, between cat species too, and not only between cats and dogs.
I hope these report will help you in the process of publishing the article.

to the interaction between pet-owning status and animal species being rated (e.g., abstract lines
16-17, first paragraph of the discussion, Conclusion). However, the effect size for this interaction
is very small (eta squared = 0.01, p 7 lines 32-33) and is 50 times smaller than the effect size of the
animal being rated (eta squared = 0.51, p 7 lines 30-31). Also the pet-owning status effect is small
(eta squared = 0.04, p 7 lines 31-32). For other types of effect, the small size of the effect is clearly
stated and discussed (e.g., p. 3 lins 21-22, p. 11 lines 14-15) but for “main” results of the study, the
authors are silent about their small effect sizes. I agreed it is interesting that cat-only owners were
more sensitive to cat meows than other groups but it needs to be conveyed clearly and
prominently to the reader that this effect explained only 1% of the total variability in the sound
rating.
6. Cat-and-dog owners seem to be similar to dog-only owners, but less so to cat-only owners. This
result is not discussed in the paper.
7. Page 10 lines 33-35. This explanation lacks internal logic. The fact that ALL participants found
the dog whines particularly plaintive cannot be explained by the fact that DOG OWNERS have a
greater tendency to anthropomorphize.
8. I found the raw data, but not the code of the statistical evaluation, on the data depository.
In conclusion, I recommend a minor revision of the paper before it will be accepted for
publication in RSOS.

The authors did a good job in reorganizing the manuscript and reaching a more balanced
conclusion.
I still have some concern about the specificity of the cat-only owner group (n = 31, the smallest
group), but the current finding may provide a hint for future studies.
Although it may not be directly related to the authors' interest, I think it would be informative to
show the data about the human baby and adult cryings more concretely. Namely, physical
parameters (Table 2) and pirate plots (Figure 2) of these sound types. If the space is limited, they
can be supplementary materials.
Minor suggestion: It would be nice to keep the number of digits (places) constant when stats are

wsitively sad: Pet-owners are more sensitive to negative emotion in animal distress vocalisations"
r Editor,
thank the reviewers for their comments, ‘I have read the paper with interest ….and I agree that the idea
the experience of interacting with pet animals increases the ability to detect distress vocalization of pet
mals is reasonable and worth examining empirically’ and ‘The topic of the article suits well the scope of
journal, and it reports new results in the field of the cross-species interpretation of acoustic signals’ and
is is a well-designed study addressing an interesting and important question. The paper is well organized
easy to read. The results are presented in sufficient detail, including the effect sizes and Fig 1 captures
main effects in a concise way. The conclusions are firmly based in the results’.
se reviews have provided important suggestions for improving our manuscript. We have substantially
sed our manuscript and present a point-by-point response to each comment received below. In brief, we
ied out an additional online experiment, in order to respond fully to two of the reviewers. We have also
rganised the manuscript as suggested, and provided additional reflections on the large population tested
e.
have made every effort to fully address the review comments, and hope the manuscript is now ready for
lication.
rs sincerely,

wsitively sad: Pet-owners are more sensitive to negative emotion in animal distress vocalisations"
iewer 1
ve one major concern and several minor questions and requests. The most serious concern is why those
owned both cats and dogs did not show the tendency similar to those who owned cats alone, the latter of
ch (n = 31) the authors argued was somehow special. In my reading, I could not find the answer to this
stion.
thank the reviewer for raising this important point, which we should have given more consideration to in
ussing the results. We have added a paragraph to the discussion to address this. We speculate that if an
lt has both a cat and dog, the dog is likely to be the dominant pet, requiring more caregiving (walks, more
uent trips outside). We speculate that having a dog and a cat means that the individual may be more
ned to the dog, and less to the cat. In this way, we argue that people who chose a cat alone are distinct
m those who own both. More broadly, we emphasise throughout that dogs are more familiar, and more
en into the fabric of our lives than cats. There are numerous analyses to show that we seek out dog-
ted content more frequently on the internet (Google Searches, video-searches, Instagram focused
ounts) (1). Even where we are not seeking out animal-related material, dogs are seen in TV commercials
e frequently than cats (2).
lated question is why cat-alone owners had a good ability to detect distress vocalization of dogs, which
did not own and had less daily experience with. If pet owners are more sensitive to negative emotion in
r pets and this ability is learned from interaction with them, the ability seems to be specific to the species
they own. An alternative explanation is that those who own pets are originally sensitive to animals'
rnal states because they care for animals. This explains all the results except the cat-only owners'
onse to cat meows. However, as I argued above, the reason why the effect of owning cats disappeared
n they had dogs at the same time is unclear. The authors may want to discuss this issue.
s is an excellent point. We have added this interpretation to the discussion (conclusion) section. This is a
cken and egg’ point, so we have also removed points about experience-dependent effects elsewhere in
manuscript (e.g., abstract).
inor points
Hypotheses. At the end of the Introduction, only a few hypotheses are listed. It would be nice to organize
he hypotheses to be tested here. In connection to this, the last sentence "We also hypothesized that cat
ers would show greater anxiety and depression symptoms compared to dog owners and adults with no
" appears suddenly. How central is this hypothesis, which is eventually rejected, to the authors' purpose
his study?
s is a secondary hypothesis – but give the previous findings on personality differences, we felt it was
th testing this, especially given the sample size available to us. We have re-organised the hypotheses in
with another reviewer’s suggestion and hope this is less abrupt now.
Sample size. Please add some comments to rationalize this sample size.
used this large sample size because we were performing a validation study of a sounds database. We
ted to ensure a sufficiently large sample to be able to test the reliability of ratings and categorisation of
nds in this database. We have added details on this as suggested (“These participants were drawn from a
er study of 945 adults who took part in a validation study for the OxVoc (the sample provided adequate
er to examine test-retest reliability and categorisation validity; Oxford Vocal Sounds Database)”.
Stimuli. On page 6, it is unclear how many sounds were used per category. Please specify.

Procedure: Were headphones used for sound presentation? Please give some explanation about how
sound intensity was adjusted.

Citation. On page 3, the reference number (7) of the AVMA report looks odd.

miss information on the specificity of human perception of animal sounds. Human are able to recognize
valence and intensity of sounds from many animals, domesticated or not, so this would be nice to have a
agraph which reports this, and explain the specific interest of working on dog and cat sounds.
agree with the reviewer that the humans are able to recognise the valence and intensity of sounds from
y animals. We have now added half a paragraph to the start of the introduction to better frame why we
interested in cats and dogs specifically – as these are our most commonly chosen domestic companions.
o, the intensity of the emotion modifies the acoustic parameters of the sounds, and you never mention
, as you focus on valence. How can you be sure intensity did not interfere in the evaluation process?
agree with the reviewer here. We did have a procedure in place, described in our previous article, to
ch the intensity of the stimuli. We have added information on this, and thank the reviewer for raising this.

method is not enough detailed to my mind. This is the weak part of the article. I have several questions:
are grateful for the opportunity to address the lack of detail here. We elaborate on all of the suggested
nts.
How did you select the 561 participants among the 945 of the larger study
s was the first 561 recruited to the study. We tested the first group of participants with the animal sounds,
the remaining participants with musical stimuli. We have added this information to the manuscript.
How is the racial/ethnic background important for the study? If you had expectations, please report them
he introduction, and include this in the statistics.
did not have any specific expectations in relation to the racial/ethnic background of participants. Rather,
report this to provide the reader with details on the student population of UCLA, which we note is not
esentative of the general US population. We have added more information to our limitations section on
potential biases within this sample.
Did you ask people for the breed they owned? There are house cats and cats that rather spend their days
ide, how could it affect the vocal expression? And thus evaluation. How long had the participants been a
er?
did not collect this information. We have added this as a limitation in the discussion.
Why are the ECR results not shown in Table 1 ? Is 3.96 a high score? Please be homogeneous for the
e types of psycho tests. In addition you should move these data (and the corresponding text) to the results
t, and probably merging table 1 and 2 would be a good option).
have removed Table 1 and moved all other findings, as the reviewer suggested. We also note that the
R is a measure of attachment style, and unlike the GAD-Q or EDS it does not have a typical cut-off score.
ead we present more information on the scoring of the ECR, to increase the interpretability of the results.
We need information about the situations of the records, as you mention in the discussion there are
eral situations in the OxVoc database. Is the vocal expression similar/close among all the situations?

do not know about the actual situations that generated the vocalisations from the animals. To counter this
tation, we recruited 31 participants via an online survey platform (Prolific; an online crowd-working
ject pool). Each participant listened to the cat and dog vocalisations and categorised the stimulus as either
’ or ‘kitten’ or ‘puppy’ or ‘dog’, and also the ‘situation’ of the sound, as the reviewer refers to it. We
ed participants to categorise if the animal sounded ‘hungry’, ‘in pain’, ‘seeking general attention’ or if
‘cannot say’. The order of these two questions was randomised across participants, and the order of the
ulus presentation was also randomised across participants. Participant inclusion criteria was: aged
ween 18- 60 years (inclusive) and no self-reported hearing difficulties. The study included an attention
ck, where participants had to select the type of vocalisation they had heard (e.g., meow or purr).
have added the data from this ‘stimulus check’ experiment to our manuscript and supplementary
erials. In brief, we found no difference between the numbers of cat and dog stimuli categorised as adult
nfant, or in the ‘reason’ for the vocalisation.
Did you use sounds from adult or young animals?

How many sounds did people evaluate?
have added this information (animal sounds n = 30, human baby cry sounds n = 21, female adult cry
nds n = 21).
How did you scale the volume? Which is highly related to intensity and valence.
have added information on the between-stimulus intensity matching procedures we followed to ensure
volume was comparable across different sounds.
Please add a “statistical analyses” part so that we have an overview on the statistics rather than having

esults
You report no gender effect on ratings, but you did not report the interaction you included in the
istical model (gender * ownership at least)
found no main effect of gender, so we did not include it as a factor in our models. We have moved this to
section on Statistical analysis and clarified.
my major concern here is that you do not know the valence of the situations: dog whines are rated as
e negative than cat meows, but how is it in reality? If the situations were of different valence (excluding
r-animals variability), how can you compare evaluations from different people? I might be confused by
fact that the method lack of details, but how can you control this?
do not have any data on the situations that these sounds arose in. Our initial selection of the sounds was
h the aim of obtaining clear exemplars of cat and dog distress vocalisations. This is a limitation, but we
e considerable efforts to address this limitation, via additional data collection. See Response to Reviewer
or further comment. Finally, we are comparing evaluations of different sounds from the same people.
“dogs whines are particularly distressing”, this sentence, and other similar sentences, is untrue. You did
evaluate the distressing impact of the sounds. This raises the question of how you asked people to do the
. Did you ask them how distressful are the sounds? Or how negative/positive is the situation for the
mal vocalizing?
have corrected this to ‘dog whines are perceived as especially sad’. We asked the participants to rate the
tional content of the sounds on a scale from ‘very happy to very sad’. We acknowledge that that there is
stinction between how the sound makes the listener feel (how distressing it is) and the perceived
tional content.
The comparison with human cries should probably be removed, as you do not explain how you did this.
at it with the same people? The same volume? In the same room? The condition of the evaluation may
act the evaluation, so this seems to be very dangerous to make comparison between studies, or including
lts from another study.
apologise that this was unclear to the reviewer, and we have amended the method section. We played the
e participants 21 baby cry sounds and 19 adult cry sounds during the same testing period, under exactly
same conditions, at the same volume, in the same room.
“no difference in cat owner’s…” once again I am not convinced the use of other sounds evaluated
where is suitable here.
above, we have now clarified that all sounds were evaluated at the same time, in the same participant
up.
cussion
you think other parameters than the pitch may explain the differences in evaluation?
re may be additional acoustic parameters that contribute to participants’ differences in evaluation,
uding the number of silences within the vocalisations (3), roughness (4) a higher frequency range (5).
wever, there is evidence that humans rely on the pitch cues to rate the distress vocalisations of other
cies with reasonable accuracy (e.g. piglet’s calls, (6); dogs’ calls, (7); cats’ solicitation purrs, (8)). In fact,
phenomenon has been referred to as the ‘pitch rule’ (5). Based on this, we believe that it is reasonable to
us our analyses on pitch, although we note that there are additional parameters of interest in future work
ticularly roughness and within-utterance silences).
explanation of the difference between dog and cat sounds may be sufficient, but information on the
eds you compared would improve a lot the discussion part. There is probably a huge variability between
species, between cat species too, and not only between cats and dogs.
agree with the reviewer that there may be differences between breeds of cats and dogs (we assume the
ewer means breeds here). However, we believe our findings serve as an interesting start point for further
k. For instance, we might hypothesise that breeds with different roles (e.g., dogs with ‘guard’ functions)
ht have distinct distress vocalisations from other breeds (e.g., hunting dogs), not least because domestic
s vary considerably in their body size. This is in contrast to domestic cats, who are arguably more similar
heir body size.
iewer 3.
It is unclear why the aspects of social-dominance, competitiveness and political conservativism aspect is
osed in quite some detail in the Introduction (page 3, lines 20-31) as these aspects are then never
tioned later in the paper.
s is a fair point, and we now interleave this into our discussion of the participant group used (who are
ly to be more liberal than the general US population, although we did not collect information on political
ntation).
Page 4, lines 16-18. When referring to the Pongracz et al 2005 paper, the authors state that “(human)
lts can accurately guess the context … and correctly infer whether the dog was aggressive, fearful or
yful”. This is an overstatement, as the listeners in that study were above chance in guessing the context
by far not totally accurate (see Fig 6 in the cited paper), and inference about one of the three types of
ations (Aggressive, fearful, playful) was correct in about 2/3 of the cases (see data in Table 5 in the cited
y).
have amended this statement to more precisely describe the Pongracz study findings ‘For instance, adults
guess, with reasonable accuracy, the context in which a dog bark occurs, scoring above chance in one
y (40% accuracy rate in a 6 category choice task (9).’ We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.
Page 3, lines 39-50, plus the whole section of Results and Discussion. All in all, there were five types of
tionships examined in the study: A. Pet ownership <-> psychological properties; B. Psychological
perties <-> sound rating; C. Pet ownership <-> sound rating; D. Species of the vocalizing animal <->
nd rating; E. acoustic properties of the calls <-> sound rating. However, this is not very transparent
m the paper. For instance, only relationships A., C. and D. are mentioned in the paragraph on p 4 lines
50 where the aims of the study are outlined.
he Results, these five types of relationship are not always clearly identified and sometimes, they are
tioned in two separate locations in the text, e.g. the effect B on p 6 l 41-43 and on p 7 lines 17-20. Also,
e of the results are missing: for instance, it is not reported wether Anxiety measure affected sound rating
ect B for GADQ). There is a need to organize this very systematically in the paper, otherwise it is difficult
the reader to keep track of questions results and interpretation. I also suggest that these 5 types of
tionships are dealt with in the same order in all the sections of the manuscript (Intro, Methods, Results,
cussion), as far as possible.
have re-examined the layout of our paper and have restructured and added ‘signposting’ in response to
reviewer’s comment. We present two analyses: 1. We examine the differences between pet-owners and
-pet owners on our 3 psychological measures (ECR, GAD-Q and EDS). We consider the effect of B
ychological properties <-> sound rating) to be secondary, and we note this. We have also added the GAD-
dog and cat vocalisation ratings correlation (non-significant). 2. A 2 x 2 design: PET OWNERSHIP

ctured in this way, and we have re-ordered our discussion so it follows the results section.
Page 5, Table 1. How did the proportions of participants that were above the cut-off scores of EDS-5
GAD-Q (77.4% and 88.2%) compare to the US general population? This might be important because
LA undergraduate psychology students might differ from the general population. This applies to other
ables and questions in the study. For instance, UCLA psychology students are probably politically non-
servative, so could it be that the dog-owners in this study are not really representative of the US dog
ers in general? (See point 1.). Also, the participants were very young and probably lived in small

the authors engage on extensive speculations about what other factors that were not investigated might
e effects on psychological profiles of dog and cat owners. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate to
tion in the discussion that the participants in the study were a particular subset of the human population
that dog / cat owners / non-owners from different strata of the population might have different
racteristics and the results of the current study may not be generalizable to them, and mention
cifically some of the possible differences, based on the available data from other studies.
understand the reviewer’s point about the population tested being a highly-selective and potentially non-
esentative university cohort. We now have a full paragraph on this in the ‘limitations’ section and we
e added more on the political orientation (which we did not measure) of the students. As for the
ression and anxiety scores, meta-analytic work suggests that depression is higher in university
ulations than in the general population (10), and anxiety-distress may also be elevated in university
ents compared to an age-matched group (11). Finally, we note that the average GAD-Q scores reported
e were similar to other university samples (e.g., university students in Houston (12)).
It is very good that effect sizes are reported for all the results. Nevertheless, there seems to be a certain
in interpreting these effect sizes. Specifically, a lot of attention in the paper is devoted to the interaction
ween pet-owning status and animal species being rated (e.g., abstract lines 16-17, first paragraph of the
ussion, Conclusion). However, the effect size for this interaction is very small (eta squared = 0.01, p 7
s 32-33) and is 50 times smaller than the effect size of the animal being rated (eta squared = 0.51, p 7
s 30-31). Also the pet-owning status effect is small (eta squared = 0.04, p 7 lines 31-32). For other types
ffect, the small size of the effect is clearly stated and discussed (e.g., p. 3 lins 21-22, p. 11 lines 14-15)
for “main” results of the study, the authors are silent about their small effect sizes. I agreed it is
resting that cat-only owners were more sensitive to cat meows than other groups but it needs to be
veyed clearly and prominently to the reader that this effect explained only 1% of the total variability in
sound rating.
s is a fair point, and we have now clarified that the ‘cat owner only’ finding is small in magnitude. We do
in multiple places throughout the manuscript. We clearly specify throughout which effects are
ll/subtle and which are larger.
Cat-and-dog owners seem to be similar to dog-only owners, but less so to cat-only owners. This result is
discussed in the paper.

have changed this sentence. We could not find any studies on non-dog owners and greater
ropomorphizing of dogs over cats. We clarify that if this effect is a general one, it might account for our

We were delighted to receive such positive appraisals of our revision to the
manuscript ‘Pawsitively sad: Pet-owners are more sensitive to
negative emotion in animal distress vocalisations’. We thank the
reviewers for the comments, ‘Your article has been greatly improved by your
answers to the reviewers, and it is now very pleasant to read it. I appreciate the
additional online survey you did, and all the efforts to revise the text’, ‘The
authors did a good job in reorganizing the manuscript and reaching a more
balanced conclusion’ and ‘It was a pleasure to review this interesting study’.
