It has often been suggested that natural selection is similar to an algorithm that learns about the
environment. Further analogies have related natural selection to information theory and to
Bayesian inference. Although those analogies seem broadly sensible, the highly developed formal
theory of natural selection is very different from formal theories of information and Bayesian
inference.
Is the analogy just a vague similarity? Or can one usefully think of natural selection as part of a
broader formal theory of learning and inference? If so, what exactly is the relation? Does the
formal relation provide insight into how natural selection has shaped the evolutionary history of
life?
This article takes a significant step toward relating natural selection and theories of learning and
inference. The authors focus on evolutionary transitions in biology, in which hierarchical
complexity develops over time. They show a possible formal relation between the evolution of
hierarchical complexity by natural selection and hierarchical Bayesian algorithms that recursively
combine subsolutions to achieve solutions to higher-level problems.
Perhaps the greatest value of this work is to show the potential for further studies.
Computational disciplines are making great progress in the analysis of learning for different
kinds of challenges. Evolutionary history in biology provides a rich empirical source of how an
algorithmic process has actually learned about complex environmental challenges. The joint
study of learning theory and evolution is likely to provide significant insight to both subjects.
I do not have specific comments about the details of the manuscript. The approach is reasonable.
But we will have to wait for further studies that explore alternative ways to relate learning
theories and evolutionary theories before we can evaluate the best approaches, potential
conceptual insights, and future directions.

It is well-known that there is a mathematical isomorphism between replicator dynamics, often
used to formalize the process of evolution by natural selection, and Bayesian updating. (Whether
this is a curiosity, or indicative of a deep conceptual connection, is of course another matter.)
The authors aim to generalize this well-known point, by pointing to an (apparent) connection
between multi-level selection and Bayesian inference in belief networks.
The paper does a good job of pointing to the isomorphism between these two bodies of theory,
which is certainly an interesting point. (Whether it shows anything deep is another matter.)
The application to evolutionary transitions, while speculative, is interesting.
The only downside of the paper is that not many readers are likely to be well-versed in both the
theory of evolutionary transitions in biology, and the theory of Bayesian model comparison in
statistics. So the readership for the paper is perhaps somewhat limited.
That said, the conceptual and formal connections that the paper makes are interesting, and worth
pointing out.

This is an extraordinarily important paper, that has the potential to be correspondingly obscure to
the unprepared reader. But its general message is quite straight forward and conceptually
important: the dynamics of how natural selection is structuring natural populations is
mathematically and, so the claim of the authors, also conceptually equivalent to Bayesian
network learning. Let me start with a few words of background:
The idea that there are deep relationships between evolution by natural selection and learning by
organisms is relatively old. This also extends to the core insight of this paper, namely that the
structure of complex organisms can be understood in analogy of concept learning, such that a
body plan of an organism can be understood as a particular “theory” of how the, for the species,
relevant parts of the world is causally structured. This idea is, for instance, the core of Rupert
Riedl’s “systems theory of evolution” (1975, English in 1978). Having said that, to my knowledge
this analogy has never been developed as clearly and with as firm a mathematical foundation as
in this paper.
Making this connection between natural selection theory and structured Bayesian learning
theory, both formally as well as conceptually [which is not the same], is an important conceptual
step that will exercise researchers for decades to come, in order to work out all the consequences
of this idea.
Not surprisingly, a paper that makes such an important step has a tendency of being obscure at
places. Here are a few hints of how to improve the accessibility of the paper.
Overall the paper would benefit if multi-level selection theory would be introduced without
reference to the analogy to Bayesian models, and the same for Bayesian models, and only then
discussing the relationship between the two. As it stands, the narrative goes forth and back
between the two and the reader not equally familiar with both has a hard time to follow the
argument.
P2, Line 10: in what sense are the authors speaking of “pre-adapted units”. I think I know what
they mean, but the usual meaning of this term is somewhat oblique to what it means here.
P2, Line 18: “extreme form of cooperation” not clear what “extreme” means?
P3, Line 14: the discrete selection equation goes back to Fisher and Wright, not Martin Nowak, as
Martin himself will assert.
P4, Line 27: the symbols “C_i^n” are introduced without explanation.
P4, line 48: here the authors seem to say that the mean fitness of the collective is the mean fitness
of the individuals it contains, but that seems to suggest that the collective does not have emergent
properties, which is contradicted later in the paper. Something is not clear in that statement. It
could mean that the mean fitness of the collective is in fact the mean fitness of the individuals AS
THEY EXPERIENCE SELECTION BEING IN THAT COLLECTIVE. Please clarify.
The last paragraph on page 6 is obscure, since it seems that the predefinition of the base functions
for the environmental state distribution has to somehow be related to the nature of the collectives
they are assigned to… may be this discussion needs to be expanded or deleted.

P7, line 34: jumping to the conclusion that these effects have to be epigenetic seems premature,
given that one can think of scenarios where the effect is due to epistatic interactions rather than
epigenetic factors.

This revision of the original submission is much better to read and much clearer. This was
achieved by introducing different concepts one at a time and then discuss their relationship, as
well as eliminating topics that can not be explained thoroughly in this short paper. I think this
version is ready for prime time.
There is only one small thing that I miss in this version and that is the following: the authors now
have a section dedicated to multilevel selection, but this section is entirely verbal. I do not think
that is what was asked for. Since the argument in this paper is mainly based on structural
similarities among mathematical models it would be nice to see the generic structure of a multi-
level selection model explained in this section.
Otherwise I maintain what I said in my previous review: this is an important paper that will
stimulate a lot of follow up work.

is an extraordinarily important paper, that has the potential to be correspondingly obscure to the
repared reader. But its general message is quite straight forward and conceptually important: the
amics of how natural selection is structuring natural populations is mathematically and, so the claim of
authors, also conceptually equivalent to Bayesian network learning. Let me start with a few words of
kground:
idea that there are deep relationships between evolution by natural selection and learning by organisms
latively old. This also extends to the core insight of this paper, namely that the structure of complex
nisms can be understood in analogy of concept learning, such that a body plan of an organism can be
erstood as a particular “theory” of how the, for the species, relevant parts of the world is causally
ctured. This idea is, for instance, the core of Rupert Riedl’s “systems theory of evolution” (1975, English
978). Having said that, to my knowledge this analogy has never been developed as clearly and with as
a mathematical foundation as in this paper.
ing this connection between natural selection theory and structured Bayesian learning theory, both
ally as well as conceptually [which is not the same], is an important conceptual step that will exercise
archers for decades to come, in order to work out all the consequences of this idea.
surprisingly, a paper that makes such an important step has a tendency of being obscure at places. Here
a few hints of how to improve the accessibility of the paper.
rall the paper would benefit if multi-level selection theory would be introduced without reference to the
ogy to Bayesian models, and the same for Bayesian models, and only then discussing the relationship
een the two. As it stands, the narrative goes forth and back between the two and the reader not equally
liar with both has a hard time to follow the argument.

hank Professor Wagner for providing a thorough review and acknowledge both the general recommendations
rding possible ways to improve accessibility and the specific comments on the manuscript.
der to improve accessibility, we added a subsection to Introduction, titled “Darwinian evolution of multilevel
lations”, where crucial points of multilevel selection and transitions in individuality are briefly discussed without
ence to Bayesian models. We also moved existing text introducing Bayesian update and replicator dynamics to a
subsection titled “The equivalence of Bayesian update and replicator dynamics” to increase the clarity of the
ture of the manuscript.
ough we agree that a separate introduction to Bayesian concepts would be helpful to the reader, we believe that
n length considerations, the brief conceptual and mathematical introduction to each relevant Bayesian concept
is provided at the beginning of each subsection in Methods serves as a good starting point to the interested but
miliar reader.
address the specific points below.
Line 10: in what sense are the authors speaking of “pre-adapted units”. I think I know what they mean,
the usual meaning of this term is somewhat oblique to what it means here.
der to avoid confusion and decrease redundancy, we deleted the second part of the sentence “via hierarchical
egation of pre-adapted subunits”.
efore, the sentence
h evolutionary transitions in individuality opened the door to the vast increase of complexity via hierarchical
egation of pre-adapted subunits.”
been changed to
h evolutionary transitions in individuality opened the door to the vast increase of complexity.”
Line 18: “extreme form of cooperation” not clear what “extreme” means?
ndeed misleading and unneccessary. We deleted “extreme form of”. We also changed the beginning of the last
ence of that paragraph from “At that point, …” to “At any phase” since multilevel selection theory is the relevant at
phase of the transition process.
Line 14: the discrete selection equation goes back to Fisher and Wright, not Martin Nowak, as Martin
self will assert.

now introduce the notation in the previous sentence by adding “ <U+0001D43C>, <U+0001D436>$ , <U+0001D436> % , …. “
sentence in this update form reads as:
discussed earlier, however, multilevel population structures can be mapped to multivariate probability
ibutions, forming multiple latent variables <U+0001D43C>, <U+0001D436>$ , <U+0001D436> % , … to be updated upon the observation of e.”

is a crucial yet highly non-trivial issue, thank you for pointing it out. We made the following changes to clarify this
t.
1. We substituted “it contains” to “being part of collective <U+0001D436>'$ ” in the referred sentence, which now reads as:
nslating this back to the language of evolution tells us that the fitness of <U+0001D436>'$ is simply the average fitness of
iduals being part of collective <U+0001D436>'$ , as anticipated earlier.”
2. We added the following explanatory sentences to the end of the referred paragraph:
cially, however, fitnesses of individuals depend on the identity of the collective they are part of. The fact that the
ss of a collective is computed as the average fitness of its individuals therefore does not constrain the way fitness
collective emerges from the fitness and/or identity of its particles as being free. Modeling the evolutionary path
rd an emerging identity of collectives is out of the scope of this paper, however, we point out that any such
avour necessarily translates to coupling parameters at different levels of the Bayesian hierarchy.”
hope that these modifications make the argument more clear.
last paragraph on page 6 is obscure, since it seems that the predefinition of the base functions for the
ronmental state distribution has to somehow be related to the nature of the collectives they are assigned
may be this discussion needs to be expanded or deleted.
ndeed obscure, and clarifying explanations would need many more points to be discussed, points that should be
on additional structures that are not introduced in this manuscript. We therefore deleted the paragraph, as it is
ential to the main line of reasoning here. (We discuss many of these points in a subsequent manuscript.)
line 34: jumping to the conclusion that these effects have to be epigenetic seems premature, given that

agree. We now emphasize epigenetic effects as well. The updated sentence is

rited information that is not coded by genes.”

revision of the original submission is much better to read and much clearer. This was
ieved by introducing different concepts one at a time and then discuss their relationship, as
as eliminating topics that can not be explained thoroughly in this short paper. I think this
ion is ready for prime time.
re is only one small thing that I miss in this version and that is the following: the authors now
e a section dedicated to multilevel selection, but this section is entirely verbal. I do not think
is what was asked for. Since the argument in this paper is mainly based on structural
ilarities among mathematical models it would be nice to see the generic structure of a multi-
l selection model explained in this section.
erwise I maintain what I said in my previous review: this is an important paper that will
ulate a lot of follow up work.
ter P. Wagner, Yale University
thank professor Wagner for the positive and constructive comments.
believe that introducing one specific model of multilevel selection might suggest to the reader that this
er is about a mathematical equivalence between Bayesian inference in hierarchical graphical models
that specific model of multilevel selection. Here, however, what we want is to raise the attention to is
ther general relation between these two concepts with many further limitations to be discussed in the
re as well as many details and possible extensions to be worked out.
therefore chose to refer to a general feature of mathematical models of multilevel selection in the
duction but did not introduce any specific formulations: in the section "Darwinian evolution of
ilevel populations", we added the sentence
ey ingredient of models of multilevel selection is the partitioning of fitness of particles to within-
ctive and between-collective components, once the collectives are defined. "
hermore, as a minor change in the same section, in order to align our introduction to multilevel
ction with the mostly used nomenclature of multilevel selection theory, we refer to the individual
cators as "particles" instead of "parts". In order to also make it accessible to a general readership, we
"i.e., lower level replicators" in parentheses after the first mention of "particle".
hope that these minor changes further improve the clarity of the paper.
