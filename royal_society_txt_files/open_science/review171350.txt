The authors reported improved photovoltaic performance based on the “sandwich”-structured
TiO2NR/HGN/CdS photoanode. This paper is recommended to be published in Royal Society
Open Science after minor revisions. However, the authors should address some comments as
below.
1. Has the reference experiment related to solid gold plasmon been carried out for better
evidence? If so, please add it.
2. The design of nanocomposites has been demonstrated to enhance performance. It is suggested
that some recent references may be cited to enrich the reference part (such as, J. Mater. Chem. A,
2017, 5, 17881; Appl. Sur. Sci. 2017, 412, 170; J. Alloy. Compd. 2017, 710, 323).
3. What is the quantity of hollow gold nanospheres for the optimized system? Please mention it.

The authors prepared DSSCs with TiO2NR/HGN/CdS photoanode and investigated its
photovoltaic performance with increased light harvesting. This paper is recommended to be
published in Royal Society Open Science after a minor:
1. If the plasmonic behavior of HGN is adjustable, which would further affect the photovoltaic
performance of TiO2NR/HGN/CdS photoanode?
2. It would be better if a control of using solid Au NPs is included to demonstrate the advantage
of this system.

ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Best wishes,
James Moore, Publishing Editor

Answers to questions of Referee 1
Comments to the Author
The authors reported improved photovoltaic performance based on the “sandwich”-structured
TiO2NR/HGN/CdS photoanode. This paper is recommended to be published in Royal Society Open
Science after minor revisions. However, the authors should address some comments as below.
According to the suggestions of Reviewer 1, the following points have been carefully corrected.
1. Has the reference experiment related to solid gold plasmon been carried out for better evidence? If
so, please add it.
Answer: The data related to solid gold plasmon have been added (Figure 7).
2. The design of nanocomposites has been demonstrated to enhance performance. It is suggested that
some recent references may be cited to enrich the reference part (such as, J. Mater. Chem. A, 2017, 5,
17881; Appl. Sur. Sci. 2017, 412, 170; J. Alloy. Compd. 2017, 710, 323).
Answer: Some new references have been added.

According to the suggestions of Reviewer 1, the following points have been carefully corrected.
1. If the plasmonic behavior of HGN is adjustable, which would further affect the photovoltaic
performance of TiO2NR/HGN/CdS photoanode?
Answer: The plasmonic behavior of HGN is adjustable, which has been proved in our previous report
(Langmuir 2016, 32, 3085-3094; RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 42653-42662). Therefore, they will affect the
photovoltaic performance of TiO2NR/HGN/CdS photoanode. This is at the point in research.
2. It would be better if a control of using solid Au NPs is included to demonstrate the advantage of this
system.
Answer: The data related to solid gold plasmon have been added (Figure 7).
