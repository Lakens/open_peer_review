The authors have used machine learning techniques to compare various aspects of the shape of
fusiform aneurisms and find certain correlations that may be useful in deciding how to treat
them. I probably erred in accepting this review since it involves machine learning to an extent far
beyond my expertise. I appreciate the opportunity to learn something however. Comments
below reflect the reaction of a general reader without expertise who is curious about the topic.

Dear Dr Zhao
On behalf of the Editors, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-180780 entitled
"Vertebral artery fusiform aneurysm geometry in predicting rupture risk" has been accepted for
publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the
referee suggestions. Please find the referees' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
5
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication, you will be
asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is approved by
Royal Society Publishing. You can find out more about the charges at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please
contact openscience@royalsociety.org.

Dear Dr Zhao,
I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Vertebral artery fusiform aneurysm
geometry in predicting rupture risk" is now accepted for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
You can expect to receive a proof of your article in the near future. Please contact the editorial
office (openscience_proofs@royalsociety.org and openscience@royalsociety.org) to let us know if
you are likely to be away from e-mail contact. Due to rapid publication and an extremely tight

uld like to thank all referees for their very helpful comments and suggestions. We extensively
our paper to address all of them in detail. In what follows, we provide our responses to all
ual comments and describe in detail specific changes in the revised manuscript made in response
pecific referees' comments and suggestions.
e added in the additional sections: Ethics statement, Data Accessibility, Competing interests,
ledgements, and Funding statement.
ginal 3D image data as well as the computed features used for the analysis presented in the
ript has been made available online through a GitHub repository which may be found at:
ithub.com/ngold5/aneurysm_classification.
nges that have been made to the manuscript have been highlighted for reference.
we respond to the individual reviewer comments, with the comments from the reviewer denoted
script and the author response in italic script below each comment.
e #1
ent: Bottom of p. 2 It would be useful for nonspecialized reader to add a brief comment
he distinction and characteristic shapes of the two types of aneurysm.
k the reviewer for this comment and have since added several sentences describing in more
e differences in the characteristic shapes of the two types of aneurysms. These comments can
d at the bottom of p. 2 highlighted in yellow.
ent: Top of p. 3 Define VAFA acronym on first use in the text as well as in the abstract?
e updated the manuscript so that the VAFA acronym (vertebral artery fusiform aneurysm) is first
before being used subsequently in the manuscript.
ent: p. 6 References should be added for the various algorithms
e addressed this by referencing each algorithm in the main text when it is first introduced. We
so added references to the algorithms appearing in their detailed description in Appendix B of
uscript.
e #2
ent: There are some typos and grammar errors. Please check them
k the reviewer for noting these errors and have since corrected them. All corrections and
