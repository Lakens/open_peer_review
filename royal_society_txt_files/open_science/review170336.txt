This paper addresses an important concern in the field of depression studies: can depression be
transmitted among peers, as a form of social contagion. Overall, it is a very good study, which
builds on previous research and makes a number of significant steps forward, namely looking at
depression and depressive symptoms across a continuum -- from good mood to mildly negative
mood to sub-threshold depression to clinical depression. In short, it makes a very important
contribution to the literature.
However, that contribution could be somewhat enhanced if a few minor issues were addressed:
1. In the abstract, the word caused is used, and I am not sure if that is a bit strong. Association
might be a better word.
2. In the abstract, the word 'resolves' is used, again I am not sure if that is a bit strong, as no single
study resolves anything; perhaps helps to resolve this issue?
3. Could the authors comment in a sentence or two on the role 'time' played in their study? This
is a time series study, so that should be discussed in a few sentences and mentioned in the
abstract.
4. Just a question: do the results suggest how the number of peers in a network influenced the
outcome? For example, in the excellent Figures at the end of the study -- Figure 2, in particular --
the results seem to suggest that the number of peers in a network seem to be of a certain degree,
past which the effect plateaus? I am not sure if I am reading the results correctly, but it seems
that is another insight. But, I could be wrong.
Having made these minor points, the rest of the paper is very good. The method used and the
models it generates are well defined and the maths provided in their support are clear and
sufficient, as these are current state of the art. The paper is well written and clear. The figures at
the end of the study are likewise very good.

This study examines the spread of multiple components of mood in a adolescent social network.
The data comes from the Add Health study, which enrolled entire secondary schools and
constructed friendship networks for participants as well as assessing many health and
demographic factors. The mood measures that the authors use are taken from individual
questions or groups of questions on the CES-D, a screening test/scale used to measure depressive
symptoms. The authors then look at how the probability that an individual changes mood
between two time points depends on the number of friends with a particular mood state and use
such relationships to quantify transmission. The paper is concise and well-written,
Overall I think this study is a useful contribution to the literature on the spread of health-related
behaviors, and is novel for studying more concrete components of mood, instead of larger
syndromes (like depression) that encompass changes in many different aspects of mood. It is
additionally novel for considering more than binary states for each mood variable. The
methodology they use to detect transmission has been introduced, justified, and described in
detail in previous published work by themselves and others (Hill, Rand, Christakis & Nowak in
Proc Roy Soc B and PLoS CB in 2010, and Hill, Griffiths & House, Proc Roy Soc B, 2015), and so
would be considered rigorous.
I only have a few minor comments. I think it would be helpful if the authors report the parameter
describing the fits for different mood components. These fits are currently shown in various
figures, but in order for other researchers to use these values, it would be nice to have them
reported in a table. Additionally, the authors have mentioned that their results are in contrast to
their own previous work suggesting that depression did not spread interpersonally (Hill,
Griffiths & House, Proc Roy Soc B, 2015), but have not mentioned another paper which used the
same method to detect contagion but in an adult social network, and similarly found that
depressive symptoms spread (Hill, Rand, Christakis & Nowak, Proc Roy Soc B 2010). Figure 4 is
quite confusing to figure out. It would be helpful to figure out a way to explain it or label it more
clearly. One minor thing that would help would be to label the color bar scale in panels a)-d), but
I think other things could be done too. Also, since CES-D scores vary from 0-54, it’s unclear why
the shading only goes up to ~7 or 9 here.

This is an interesting and well-written paper which extends the earlier work on contagion of
binary mood states by examining categorical /continuous mood states.
I have one question, which may warrant some further analysis and then a few minor points.
1. Did you consider increasing the tolerance for equality between Xt and X(t+1). For single
item scales where there are only maybe 3 categories it makes sense, but for a score ranging 0-50
then it may be appropriate that rather than saying people stayed exactly the same, they stayed
the same within an arbitrary range (say +-0.3D or half a minimum clinically important
difference). This approach to tolerance is commonly used e.g. in entropy measures such as
sample entropy. I wonder if this would create a clearer signal and be a different way of filtering
out some of the random noise between t and t+1. If it also confirmed the findings of the Gaussian
approach it would make the conclusion – that happy friends can pick you up, but sad friends
don’t make you depressed – easier to understand
2. I don’t think you say in the paper the number of people in the dataset (either in total or
the subset which you use).
3. I found the Gaussian filtered data difficult to grasp and had to take it “on trust”. This
may be because I am not a mathematician but I wonder if a little more information would be
useful in the body of the paper here.
4. Figures 1-4. I took a few moments to realise that the empty diamonds were fitted and the
black circles were data points. Should there be a legend to show that? I realise that legend
conventions are different across domains and it may be unnecessary to elaborate)

Dear Editor and Reviewers,
Thank you for the comments provided about our manuscript “Spreading of components of mood in adoles-
cent social networks”. These have proved very useful in reworking the manuscript, resulting in changes that
we believe improved the article.
Within this letter we set out our responses to your comments, pointing out where changes have been made
n the manuscript. We have included a document tracked changes.pdf that makes the details of our revisions
clear.
Our responses are as follows. To reviewer 1:
• In the abstract, the word caused is used, and I am not sure if that is a bit strong. Association might be
a better word.
While we do not believe we used the word “caused” verbatim, we did use wording in the initial abstract
that incorrectly implied causation and we have therefore changed this to association (see the tracked
changes document).
• In the abstract, the word ’resolves’ is used, again I am not sure if that is a bit strong, as no single study
resolves anything; perhaps helps to resolve this issue?
We have made the change as suggested (see the tracked changes document).
• Could the authors comment in a sentence or two on the role ’time’ played in their study? This is a time
series study, so that should be discussed in a few sentences and mentioned in the abstract.
We agree with the reviewer’s point here about commenting on the role ‘time’ played in he study. We
have added a short comment in the paper on this (page 5, line 115 of the tracked changes document),
with the revised sentence stating: “Such an approach is robust to confounding from homophily and
shared context due to the stratification of the state transition probability over time by the number of
contagious state friends”. We have also included a mention of use of time in the abstract (see the
tracked changes document). We feel this complements the involvement of time as described in terms
of the model transition probabilities between mood states.
• do the results suggest how the number of peers in a network influenced the outcome?
Due to the large confidence intervals at higher numbers of worse and better mood friends, we believe
it is dangerous to derive too many conclusions from the shape of the model fits. However we do note
the lack of a threshold in the number of friends required to lead to a contagion effect and have added
a comment to reflect this (page 8, lines 189-196 of the tracked changes document).
To reviewer 2:
• I think it would be helpful if the authors report the parameter describing the fits for different mood
components.
This has now been added, and can be seen in the tables section towards the end of the manuscript as
well as in the electronic supplementary material.
• The methodology they use to detect transmission has been introduced, justified, and described in detail
in previous published work by themselves and others (Hill, Rand, Christakis Nowak in Proc Roy Soc B
and PLoS CB in 2010) . . . have not mentioned another paper which used the same method to detect
contagion but in an adult social network, and similarly found that depressive symptoms spread (Hill,
Rand, Christakis & Nowak, Proc Roy Soc B 2010)
This was an oversight on our part three of us had cited the important work by Hill, Rand, Christakis &
Nowak in our earlier paper, and we have now added the citations here, as well as adding a comparative
discussion of methodology and conclusions in the Discussion section (page 9, lines 215-227 of the
tracked changes document).
• Figure 4 is quite confusing to figure out. It would be helpful to figure out a way to explain it or label it
more clearly.
We have now added further labels to the figure to assist readability. In particular, we have added labels
to the colour bars to denote whether they correspond to mean number of friends with worse mood,
or mean number of friends with better mood. Additionally we have added the following description
to the figure caption to help clarify the interpretation of the shading: “The light regions in these plots
therefore show where individuals with greater numbers of worse or better mood friends, and therefore
those we expect to experience a stronger contagion effect, are concentrated”. We have elaborated on
other elements of the caption, highlighted in the tracked changes document.
To reviewer 3:
• Did you consider increasing the tolerance for equality between Xt and X(t+1).
We performed a sensitivity analysis on this tolerance as suggested and found that the tolerance needed
to be increased to quite an extreme value before we started to see a substantial change in the results
such that forms of the model other than the general contagion one performed better. As such we
believe this supports the robustness of the results against noise in the data. We have added a comment
on this (page 6, lines 142-147, and page 7, lines 171-179 of the tracked changes document).
• I don’t think you say in the paper the number of people in the dataset (either in total or the subset
which you use).
We thank the reviewer for spotting this omission. We have now added this (page 4, line 102 of the
tracked changes document).
• I found the Gaussian filtered data difficult to grasp and had to take it on trust. This may be because I
am not a mathematician but I wonder if a little more information would be useful in the body of the
paper here.
We have relabelled Figure 4 at the request of the second reviewer which we hope aids clarity. Please
also see the explanation we give above in answer to the third comment of the second reviewer. The
use of Gaussian processes is only in smoothing the empirical data in order to make what is occurring
within it clearer, hence why we felt that providing more technical details within the main text would
distract from the primary focus of the manuscript. Nonetheless, we do provide further details on the
methodology within the electronic supplementary material.
• Figures 1-4. I took a few moments to realise that the empty diamonds were fitted and the black circles
were data points. Should there be a legend to show that?
We apologise for the lack of clarity. To address this we have now added descriptions to the figure
captions in order to help readers distinguish between the fits and the observations.
Again, thank you for the comments. We hope that we have satisfactorily addressed them. If not, then we are
pleased to make any further changes deemed necessary.
Sincerely,
Robert Eyre (corresponding author)

3 Background
4 Depression and other associated mood disorders form an increasing burden upon
5 the health of modern society. The World Health Organisation estimates that 350
6 million people are affected by depression throughout the world, leading to morbidity
7 through a reduced ability to work and socialise, as well as mortality due to suicide
8 and other causes [1]. Evidence suggests mood may spread from person to person
9 via a process known as social contagion. Previous studies have found social support
0 and befriending to be beneficial to mood disorders in adolescents [2–5], while recent
1 experiments suggest that an individuals emotional state can be affected by exposure
2 to the emotional expressions of social contacts [6]. Clearly, a greater understanding
3 of how changes in the mood of adolescents are affected by the mood of their friends
4 would be beneficial in informing interventions tackling adolescent depression.
5 In recent years evidence has been found to suggest that some behaviour-based
6 illnesses, such as obesity and smoking cessation, can spread from person to person
7 via social contagion [7–14] :::::: [7–15]. However such work has come under criticism
8 for being unable to distinguish contagion from other possible phenomena that could
9 confound any positive findings of contagion [16–19]. The two simplest confounding
0 phenomena are homophily, where individuals become friends due to sharing the same
1 behaviour, and shared context, where individuals tend towards the same behaviour
2 whether they are friends or not due to some outside influence [16].
3 Three of the authors of the current work recently developed a model that distin-
4 guishes contagion from homophily and shared context. In this approach, we assess
5 statistically whether the probability of an individual changing between binary states
6 over time forms a better fit to the data when risk is stratified by the number of same
7 or opposing state friends the individual has, or when risk is independent of the
8 state of the individuals friends [20]. This showed that while healthy mood spreads,
9 depression does not, although treating a complex set of mood states as either ‘ill’
0 or ‘not ill’ can be an oversimplification. Doing this in the case of depression ig-
1 nores all individuals with sub-threshold levels of depressive symptoms, despite their
2 public-health importance [21].
3 Further, individual component symptoms of depression have not to our knowl-
4 edge been considered when modelling social contagion, despite being much easier
5 to measure and track in certain cases. These may provide an alternative basis for
6 formulating future interventions. In the present study, we therefore consider the pos-
7 sibility of social influence upon mood by considering arrays of possible mood states.
8 We first generalise our confounding-robust model to non-binary states, than apply it
9 to data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add
0 Health) [22]. We do this for mood as a whole and for the following seven potential
1 depressive symptoms: anhedonia (loss of interest), poor appetite, poor concentra-
2 tion, dysphoria (sadness), helplessness, tiredness, and worthlessness. In general,
3 both high and low values of these measures exhibit social contagion. We also intro-
4 duce a complementary Gaussian process model that helps to demonstrate why these
5 results are consistent with the observation that depression does not spread in social
6 networks. To conclude we discuss the possible implications of our results to public
7 policy and health.
8 Methods
9 Data
0 We used data from the first two waves of the in-home interview survey of Add Health,
1 which were performed 6-12 months apart. These included records of adolescents’ in-
2 school friends [22]. We defined the mood state of each individual in our study using
3 their Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) score calculated
4 from the set of 18 CES-D questions asked within the survey [23]. This gave a discrete
5 integer mood state for each individual ranging from 0 to 54, where a higher state
6 indicated a worse mood.
7 To analyse individual depressive symptoms, we split the total CES-D score into
8 composite parts associated with the subsets of questions related to each symptom.
9 The symptoms analysed were anhedonia (loss of interest), poor appetite, poor con-
0 centration, dysphoria (sadness), helplessness, tiredness, and worthlessness. The
1 range of states depended on the number of questions related to that symptom.
2 Some, such as poor appetite, only ranged between 0 and 3 whilst others, such as
3 helplessness, ranged between 0 and 15. In these cases a higher state indicated a
4 worse case of that symptom.
5 To be included in our study sample analysing mood state and the individual
6 depressive symptoms, at both time points the adolescent student had to be from a
7 saturated school (in which all students were given the in-home interview, eliminating
8 selection bias and ensuring as complete a social network as possible), have given
9 complete answers to all the CES-D survey related questions, and have been the least
0 restricted in the number of school friends they were allowed to give (each student
1 was either asked to list up to five male and five female friends, or were limited to
2 only listing one male and one female friend). This gave us a sample size of 2194
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
3 individuals.
:::::::::::::
4 Contagion model
5 If we let a component of mood for an individual at time t with k friends with better
6 mood and k 0 friends with worse mood be represented by an integer random variable
7 X(t), we can imagine a very general probabilistic model for mood in which
Pr(X(t + 1) = x0 | X(t) = x) = f (x0 , x, k, k 0 ) . (1)
8 In practice, finding an appropriate function f for such a general model becomes too
9 difficult and so we will normally need to consider special cases of this general model.
0 In our earlier work [20] we considered only binary states X(t) = D for an individual
1 with depressive symptoms at time t and X(t) = N for a non-depressed (healthy)
2 individual, and sought to distinguish between sigmoidal dependence on the number
3 of friends in a given state and no such dependence.
4 Such an approach is robust to confounding from homophily and shared context
5 due to the stratification of the state transition probability over time by the number
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
6 of contagious state friends, but it does not account for the possibility of different
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
7 numerical scores for the CES-D components. To relax this assumption we now let
8 X(t) be an integer, and consider a trinomial model specified by three probabili-
9 ties: the probability of increasing state, the probability of decreasing state, and the
0 probability of remaining in the same state.
Pr (Xi (t + 1) > Xi (t)) = p ,
Pr (Xi (t + 1) < Xi (t)) = q , (2)
Pr (Xi (t + 1) = Xi (t)) = 1 - p - q .
1 We examined whether these probabilities were dependent on the states of an individ-
2 uals friends relative to their own at the first time point by comparing two different
3 functional forms for p and q. The first was conditioned on the number of friends of
4 an individuals who had higher / lower score at the first time point, k. This took the
5 form of a discrete S-shaped (sigmoidal) function, appropriate for behavioural conta-
6 gion being a type of complex contagion [14, 24, 25], with the following mathematical
7 formulation:
k  
X 10 l
pk = a + ß <U+03B3> (1 - <U+03B3>)1-l ,
l=0
l
k
(3)
X 10
qk = d +  <U+03B6> l (1 - <U+03B6>)1-l .
l=0
l
8 The second functional form for p and q was independent of the states of the friends:
pk = a , qk = d . (4)
9 Using each possible combination of these two functional forms gave us four models
0 to compare. Model 1, where pk and qk are given by (3), has both increasing and
1 decreasing state being dependent on friend states. Model 2, where pk and qk are
2 given by (4), has neither increasing nor decreasing state being dependent on friend
3 states. Model 3, where pk is given by (3) and qk by (4), has increasing state alone
4 being dependent on friend states. Model 4, where pk is given by (4) and qk by (3),
5 has decreasing state alone being dependent on friend states. These modelswere

2 Gaussian process model
3 The model described above deals with the probability of a change of state X(t) <U+2192>
4 X(t + 1) given a number k of better or worse scoring friends. We might instead
5 assume that the initial state X(t) and the state at the next time point X(t + 1)
6 are known and treat the number of friends k (either better or worse) as the random
7 variable to be modelled. As we will see, the data in this form is very noisy and so we
8 smooth the function k(X(t), X(t + 1)) using Gaussian process regression [27]. This
9 semi-parametric statistical method allows patterns in the data to become manifest
0 without imposing too much a priori structure on the model. More detail is given in
1 the electronic supplementary material.
2 Results and Discussion
3 In the case of overall mood (i.e. the total CES-D score) for both conditioning on
4 higher and state and on lower state friends, the preferred model turns out to be Model
5 1 where both increasing and decreasing state are dependent on the friends’ states
6 and:::::::
(see Figure 1 :::: 1). This leads to the conclusion that, for US adolescents,
Table ::
7 the greater number of worse mood friends they have, the more likely they are to get
8 worse in mood and the less likely they are to get better, and vice versa for better
9 mood friends. The fact that mood is influenced socially by both worse and better
0 mood friends in this way gives support to social contagion of mood.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
6 was 10. Note that under these conditions the majority of individuals are set as
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
7 never changing mood and most as being the same mood. This indicates that the
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
8 finding from the baseline analysis is robust against possible noise in the data, and
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
9 that support is indeed given to general contagion of mood.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
0 Similar results were found for the individual depressive symptoms of anhedonia,
1 poor concentration, dysphoria, helplessness, tiredness, and worthlessness (see Fig-
2 and:::::::
ure 2 :::: 2 :for helplessness, further results in the electronic supplementary
Table ::
3 material). The only exception is poor appetite (see Figure 3 and Table 3). In this
::::::::::::
4 instance we found that Model 4 was preferred, where decreasing state alone is af-
5 fected by friend states, although we caution against over-interpretation of this result
6 since AIC is not an infallible method for model selection. In all cases, no models
7 were rejected under the goodness-of-fit tests (details in the electronic supplementary
8 material).
9 Although the results (Figures 1 to 3 and the further results shown in the electronic
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
0 supplementary material) show a particular shape to the mood change probabilities
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
1 over the number of worse and better mood friends, due to the large confidence
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
2 intervals about the data for high numbers of friends (caused by the lack of data in
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
3 these regions) most conclusions that could be inferred from these shapes would not
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
4 be particularly robust. Yet they do appear to highlight the absence of thresholds
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
5 on the number of friends exhibiting a worse or better mood to result in a contagion
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
6 effect, which is unusual for complex contagion.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
7 These results superficially contradict our earlier work finding that healthy mood
8 spreads whilst depression does not [20]. However, our Gaussian process model shows
9 that most of the individuals with a greater number of higher scoring friends who
0 were initially below the threshold for depression remained that way at the second
1 time point, whilst the individuals with a greater number of lower scoring friends
2 are more spread out in their score combinations such that many that started off
3 above the threshold for depression passed below the threshold at the second time
4 point (Figure 4). This suggests that both better and worse mood are contagious, but
5 whilst better mood is contagious enough to push individuals over the boundary from
6 depressed to not depressed worse mood is not contagious enough to push individuals
7 into becoming depressed. Consequently, we would not expect to find contagion-like
8 characteristics for depression using a binary model.
9 We therefore observe a difference between depression, which we found not to
0 spread, and relatively low mood below the threshold for depression, which we found
1 did spread. This supports the view that there is more to clinical depression than
2 simply low mood (although the latter may be indicative of the former). It is also in
3 keeping with a tendency for a reduction in the normal social interactions that lead
4 to spreading of mood during an episode of depression [28].
5 Of existing studies by other authors, the work of Hill, Rand, Christakis, &
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
6 Nowak [15] is closest to ours, and using a different dataset these authors concluded
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
7 that ‘neutral’ moods did not spread but both ‘content’ (threshold CES-D score
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
8 12 on the positively worded questions only) and ‘discontent’ (threshold CES-D

9 score 16) moods did. This work tested models of the form pk = a + ßk ::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
4 that the most important difference with the results presented here is our use of a
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
5 CES-D threshold score of 20 (or 21) for presumptive depression - and in particular
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
6 that the spreading of ‘discontent’ at CES-D scores in the 16-20 range is consistent
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
7 with our results about the spreading of sub-threshold levels of depressive symptoms.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
8
9 The results found here can inform public health policy and the design of interven-
0 tions against depression in adolescents. Sub-threshold levels of depressive symptoms
1 in adolescents is an issue of great current concern as they have been found to be
2 very common, to cause a reduced quality of life, and to lead to greater risk of de-
3 pression later on in life than having no symptoms at all [29–31]. Understanding
4 that these components of mood can spread socially suggests that while the primary
5 target of social interventions should be to increase friendship because of its benefits
6 in reducing of the risk of depression, a secondary aim could be to reduce spreading
7 of negative mood.
8 Our study comes with certain limitations. As noted above, we were not able to
9 formulate from first principles a fully general model for the components of mood as a
0 function of friends’ moods. We were also unable to learn such a model from data due
1 to the sample size of the study being constrained by the necessity of constructing
2 as complete a friendship network as possible. The friendship network itself may
3 also not be complete. However, as the majority of individuals failed to list the
4 maximum number of friends allowed this implies the network may in fact approach
5 completeness.
6 We anticipate that future work can further enhance these models in order to
7 cope with a wider range of datasets and more realistically reflect the mechanisms
8 underlying social contagion. Furthermore, we hope that these insights can be used
9 to drive improvements in public health policy and practice.

Figure 4: Wave 1 and Wave 2 Centre for Epidemiological Studies depression scale
(CES-D) score for (a,b) our empirical sample and (c,d) Gaussian process model. Left
column (a,c,e) is coloured by mean number of friends with worse mood k¯::+: and right
column (b,d,f) is coloured by mean number of friends with better mood k¯::- . The
light regions in these plots therefore show where individuals with greater numbers
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
of worse or better mood friends, and therefore those we expect to experience a
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
stronger contagion effect, are concentrated. The set of states for those who have
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
not changed in state is shown by the diagonal solid red line. The gender-averaged
threshold boundary between the states of depressed and not depressed for each
wave are shown by the dashed red lines, and the plots (e,f) show how to interpret
the delineated quadrants. We see that individuals with more ::::::: with ::::::

mood (corresponding to higher scoring friends)::are contained in the bottom left
