This manuscript tries to improve the quality of thin films by optimizing the rotation speed of self-
rotating susceptor (not different substrates as authors claimed) in a planetary reactor for GaN-
MOCVD. The effects of rotation speeds on CVD growth have been studied widely, e.g., by K F.
Jensen of MIT. Little new information has been given in this manuscript. Furthermore, rotation
speeds mainly influence the uniformity of flow fields and concentration fields, but not growth
quality directly. Considering the effect of rotation speeds, the variations of the flow and
concentration fields with rotation speeds are still not given, none are the chemical reaction
models of gas phase and surface, which are essential to validate the simulation results. Thus the
results can not be applied to general case of MOCVD growth.

In this work, the authors report a simulation study of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition
aimed at the guide for the optimization of experimental parameters in homogeneous GaN film
deposition. The finite elemental analysis based on computational fluid dynamics determines the
geometry influence of the substrate locations relative to the gas flow inlet. Then the gas flow
velocity, the temperature and deposition rates has been simulated for the wafer substrates at all
the mounting holders of the chamber. Then the resultant thin film thickness is simulated
depending on the regions and sample rotation speed. Eventually, the optimal parameters are

Associate Editor's comments:
Two conflicting recommendations have been received. The second referee points out some
corrections that are required but suggests accept with minor revision. The first referee
recommends rejection based on their suggestion that the effects of rotation speeds on CVD
growth have been studied widely. Actually studies into the mechanisms of CVD are still rather
limited and hence this submission is within the remit of this journal since it does sufficiently
advance scientific knowledge and it will provide a meaningful contribution to the literature.
However, the authors do need to address the issues raised by both referees including the effect of
variations of the flow and concentration fields with rotation speeds and the chemical reaction
models of gas phase and surface.
