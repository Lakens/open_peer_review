To Ed.: This research is innovative and interesting, but I am not sure the results actually support
the authors’ conclusions – possibly because at times the writing is confusing so it is not easy to
understand what they did or what the results were. The sample size is adequate but just barely.
If the authors can better explain their results, this may become publishable in Royal Soc Open
science. I have signed my review and do not wish to remain anonymous.
This paper reports an interesting experimental approach to an important problem in evolutionary
ecology, and investigates grand-maternal effects in offspring sex ratio. I found the writing at
times hard to follow. Unfortunately, the usable sample size is rather small and the results are
somewhat confusing. If I understood this paper correctly, grand maternal treatment affected
offspring sex ratio, but when the change in glucose of mothers (referred to as focal females) was
accounted for, the grand maternal treatment effect disappeared. More puzzling, there appears to
be no effect of the grand maternal manipulation on glucose changes in daughters – therefore I am
rather confused by these results and their interpretation.
Specific comments:
The Abstract should mention the study species.
P. 4, lines 6-7: not sure the start of this sentence makes sense - the first two 'by' are confusing.
P. 4 l. 18: those what? This paragraph needs a rewrite.
P. 7 l. 18: at this point it is not clear what is a focal pup.
P. 9, l. 11-12: I do not understand this - how can a t-test be used to test a ratio? If it was the ratio
for each mother, why no df’s? Also, if this was the case, where the ratios normally distributed?
l. 14: not clear what this test refers to. Combined controls compared to experimental?
l. 22-23: Do sex ratio and sex allocation mean the same here?
P. 10 l. 23: P =0.03?
P. 11 l. 1: Not clear why this analysis is relegated to the supplementary material, it seems that it
should be in the paper. Also, it looks like the experimental treatment had an effect which
disappeared when changes in glucose were accounted for - but then the treatment should have
had an effect on changes in glucose? Fig. 3 suggest that daughters of treated females had lower
glucose, but that was apparently not the case according to line 2. Finally, was glucose change
related to initial levels? One may expect a greater increase if the initial level is low, simply
because of the tendency of most biological data to regress towards the mean.
l. 2: is this overall blood glucose level, or does this refer to the change shown in Fig. 3? If it is not
the change, then we need to know of change in glucose and treatment were correlated.
l. 8: no what?
3
l. 16: again, is this sex ratio? Best not to switch between terms.
l. 18-19: True, but when the change in glucose level in the daughter, apparently not related to
maternal treatment, was included in the analysis, this effect disappeared.
l. 21-22: well, no, because the treatment had no effect on daughter glucose.
P. 12 l.12: This statement may require a model selection approach to be justified. For now, the
results just seem to show that the treatment effect disappears when glucose changes are
accounted for.

This article examines whether stress experienced in utero influenced sex allocation and
physiological development in laboratory mice. The results suggest that in female’s lower stress
early in development biased birth sex ratios towards females, likely owing to their increased
peril-conception blood glucose levels. Litter size of females was not affected. No effect of stress in
utero on male sex allocation was found. My specific comments are numbered below. The biggest
concern I have deals with the statistical treatment of the data. These concerns have direct
relevance on the reliability of the biological conclusions that can be drawn from these data.
1. The experimental approach looks fine to me, although I was wondering why late gestation
period was manipulated only? Perhaps this should be explained in more detail. Moreover, the
authors say (on page 7, line 9) that their manipulation resulted in variable dosages of
dexamethasone, but that this approach is preferable to injections. While I agree with this logic, do
the authors have a way to quantify the amount of potential between-individual variation in
dexamethasone levels after the treatment? My expertise does not allow me to evaluate the
appropriateness of the molecular methods used in sperm sex-determination.

2. One pup of each sex per litter was chosen to avoid pseudoreplication (page 7, line 21). I think
that multilevel modeling would have been a rather straightforward approach to account for such
pseudoreplication. So, I was left wondering whether the underlying reason for this was to just
reduce the number of animals housed and not the pseudoreplication per se?
3. I’m not totally convinced that the vehicle control and negative control groups had equal sex
ratios (page 9, line 11 onwards). First, it seems that the authors have analyzed the differences in
sex ratios by using statistical models that assume normally distributed residuals although sex
ratio data should be analyzed with logistic regressions (Wilson & Hardy 2002). Second, in global
model the p-value is very close to (p=0.07) of being statistically significant. Moreover, the authors
talk about “two full data models” but apparently do not report the result when running the
model with three treatment groups? Given the small sample size used here and small presumed
effect sizes with respect to sex allocation (West 2009), this test in question must have a rather low
statistical power. In other words, there might be a true difference between the vehicle control and
negative control groups but the current data is unpowered to detect it. What’s important here is
whether this grouping had any bearing on the biological interpretation of the data? I mean did
the results change had you not performed such grouping? From a statistical perspective, I cannot
think of any other reason than preserving degrees of freedom (given the small sample size) that
would justify such a grouping in this experimental design.
4. In addition to examining litter size and sex ratio, the authors also looked for the group
differences in several physiological variables recorded from focal individuals. So, in the end, they
have something like seven response variables in total, measured from the same individuals. In
statistical terms, they face a problem of multiple testing if these response variables are correlated.
The authors should thus try to control for false positive findings by fitting e.g. MANOVA-type of
models, or at least provide a correlation matrix for those response variables.
5. The authors also used GLMs to identify the variables with the highest predictive effect on
offspring and sperm sex ratio. From a statistical point of view, the good thing here is that the
authors treat sex ratio outcomes as discrete variables. The downside of the model is that they are
grossly overfitted: for example, in females the model estimates 7 parameters (of which some
might even be strongly correlated to each other?) with only 31 observations. A common rule of
thumb is that one should have at least 10 independent observations per estimated parameter.
Therefore, the results can be seriously biased. It is very confusing that the authors use these two
different models (ANOVA and GLM) to study the same question and then these models show
different results with respect to the main hypothesis tested here. In my opinion, this study has a
clear experimental design and hypothesis and it does not have to “predict” anything. I would
thus recommend using just one model, perhaps with some carefully (a priori) considered
variables as covariates.
To summarize, I find this research interesting and certainly worth of publishing but the statistical
approach used here seems inappropriate, which unfortunately cast doubts to the biological
conclusion drawn from the data.

In general, the authors have been responsive to my suggestions (mainly about statistics) and thus
I have no further major issues about the study. However, there was couple of things in the
Statistics/Results section that caught my eye. First, using binary logistic regression the authors
state that they tested the hypothesis: “…whether the treatment group, or either control group
9
presented with sex ratios different to the predicted 50:50 ratios” (page 9, lines 19-21). Perhaps I
missed something but why the authors tested this hypothesis and not the hypothesis that sex
ratios differed between the treatment groups? Second, please explain what are the numbers e.g.
in: “(GLM: -0.943, -0.161)”? 95% confidence intervals of the point estimate? Third, I think that if
the omnibus test in MANOVA shows that some independent variable has no overall influence on
the responses, then there is little to gain from providing the results of univariate tests. Therefore,
perhaps the authors should report the results of MANOVA-model only?

Dear authors,
I have been invited for the first time to comment on your manuscript entitled “Gestational
experience alters sex allocation in the subsequent generation”.
I think the idea of studying long-lasting effects of early-life conditions on sex allocation is
excellent. While long-term consequences of early-life conditions have long been recognized in
animal populations, most studies have focused on life-history traits such as growth, reproduction
and survival without considering possible effect on sex ratio during adulthood. There are,
however, a few problems with this paper. The main ones are about analysis and interpretation of
results (see comments 4, 7 and 8).
Introduction
1) The term “constraint” in sex allocation theory is connected with the prevailing idea that
vertebrates with chromosomal sex determination have little scope for skewing sex ratio at birth
10
because of meiosis. The meaning of “constraint” seems different in this manuscript, so I would
like that you give more details on use of this word.
2) Your work is intimately linked to the concept of ‘programming’, which Lucas (1991)
defined as the capacity of environmental stimuli during critical developmental periods to exert
long-term or permanent effects on subsequent structure and function of the organism. The
concept of ‘programming” is crucial for understanding of the outlined effects and should not be
overlooked.
3) Predictions could help to synthesize the fourth paragraph but are currently lacking.
Material & Methods
4) Measure of body condition. The relationship between the body mass and the body size
is allometric. Thus, body mass and length values should be log-transformed.
5) In figure 1 there are 36 focal males, while you say that 3 of the 40 initial litters did not
produce any males.
Results
6) Page 10, lines 15 to 18. Please specify meaning of the values. In addition, it would better
to report that the sex ratio of offspring was not affected by treatment in this paragraph.
7) Is there an interaction between peri-conceptual change in glucose and treatment on sex
ratio? A test of this interaction seems biologically relevant given “environmental interactions
with glucose metabolism may be more influential than maternal effects” (page 11, line 20 and 21).
8) Page 10, line 21 and 22: “the treatment did not result in a change in litter size (F2,28 =
3.174, P = 0.057).” The traditional p-value of 0.05 is an arbitrary decision rule and p-values are
strongly influenced by sample size. You have a low sample size (n ~ 30), so a p-value of 0.057
may correspond to a large effect size. More information on this trend is required with a figure for
example. Also, your conclusion that there is no change in litter size according to treatment should
be revised.
Discussion
9) It is not clear to me sometimes if you discuss your own results or others studies. Please
clarify that for example in page 11 (line 23 and 24), page 12 (line 9 and 10).
10) Page 13, line 1. I agree with that but you may cite some studies in mammals showing
that males can contribute to biases in sex ratio (e.g., Gomendio et al. 2006 Science, Roed et al. 2007
PRSB, Douhard et al. 2014 Evolution).
I hope that these comments could help to improve the manuscript.

7) Is there an interaction between peri-conceptual change in glucose and treatment on sex
ratio? A test of this interaction seems biologically relevant given “environmental interactions
with glucose metabolism may be more influential than maternal effects” (page 11, line 20 and 21).
8) Page 10, line 21 and 22: “the treatment did not result in a change in litter size (F2,28 =
3.174, P = 0.057).” The traditional p-value of 0.05 is an arbitrary decision rule and p-values are
strongly influenced by sample size. You have a low sample size (n ~ 30), so a p-value of 0.057
may correspond to a large effect size. More information on this trend is required with a figure for
example. Also, your conclusion that there is no change in litter size according to treatment should
be revised.
Discussion
9) It is not clear to me sometimes if you discuss your own results or others studies. Please
clarify that for example in page 11 (line 23 and 24), page 12 (line 9 and 10).
10) Page 13, line 1. I agree with that but you may cite some studies in mammals showing
that males can contribute to biases in sex ratio (e.g., Gomendio et al. 2006 Science, Roed et al. 2007
PRSB, Douhard et al. 2014 Evolution).
I hope that these comments could help to improve the manuscript.

Dear Kevin Padian,
I would like to thank you for your time in considering our manuscript for publication.
Please find our resubmission containing all changes as requested by your reviewers. I
have outlined below, in detail, how our manuscript has addressed the issues outlined
by your reviewers. In general, the main concern of your reviewers regarded the
statistical methods used, in light of those concerns we have reanalysed the data using
a series of generalised linear models that conform with the assumptions of the
binomial data presented. We have also taken on the reviewer’s suggestion to utilise a
multivariate analysis of variance, instead of a series of analyses of variances, however
we have presented the univariate results as well as those from the Pillai test. The re-
analysis has not changed the biological interpretation of the data.
We believe that the changes we have made will satisfy the concerns, and have
subsequently improved our manuscript.
Response to reviewers in italics.
Reviewer: 1
Specific comments:
The Abstract should mention the study species.
This has been adjusted.
P. 4, lines 6-7: not sure the start of this sentence makes sense - the first two 'by' are
confusing.
This sentence has now been adjusted to:
“Stressors experienced by the mother are mediated through internal hormone
fluctuations; stressors stimulate the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone from
the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone from the pituitary gland, resulting in the release of glucocorticoids”
P. 4 l. 18: those what? This paragraph needs a rewrite.
This sentence has now been adjusted to:
“Offspring fitness may be increased, for example by matching poor-quality mothers
with reduced offspring demand, and offspring traits that increase survival.”
P. 7 l. 18: at this point it is not clear what is a focal pup.
We have given a full explanation of what a ‘focal pup’ is at this point.
P. 9, l. 11-12: I do not understand this - how can a t-test be used to test a ratio? If it
was the ratio for each mother, why no df’s? Also, if this was the case, where the
ratios normally distributed?
All t-tests have been removed and replaced by more appropriate statistical tests. We
have used only generalised linear models for binomial data, and a MANOVA for
comparing physical features.
l. 14: not clear what this test refers to. Combined controls compared to experimental?
All statistical methods and results have been updated, and this should now be clear.
l. 22-23: Do sex ratio and sex allocation mean the same here?
They do refer to the same thing. We have altered sex allocation, to read sex ratios to
remove that confusion.
P. 10 l. 23: P =0.03?
P=0.038, this has been changed to P=0.04.
P. 11 l. 1: Not clear why this analysis is relegated to the supplementary material, it
seems that it should be in the paper. Also, it looks like the experimental treatment had
an effect which disappeared when changes in glucose were accounted for - but then
the treatment should have had an effect on changes in glucose? Fig. 3 suggests that
daughters of treated females had lower glucose, but that was apparently not the case
according to line 2. Finally, was glucose change related to initial levels? One may
expect a greater increase if the initial level is low, simply because of the tendency of
most biological data to regress towards the mean.
Fig 3. Does not show that the daughters of the treatment animals had lower changes
in glucose - the data for both treatments are equally spread across X-axis. It shows
that the treatment animals are below the average relationship line, suggesting lower
sex ratios for the same change in glucose. However, all statistical methods and results
have been updated, and this should now be clear.
Change in glucose does appear to be related to initial levels, and we agree that this
may be due to the tendency to regress towards the mean, however this does not
influence the result that we are presenting.
l. 2: is this overall blood glucose level, or does this refer to the change shown in Fig.
3? If it is not the change, then we need to know of change in glucose and treatment
were correlated.
This was referring to blood glucose at conception; we have now included both initial
and change in glucose as requested.
l. 8: no what?
“No differences” – this sentence has been amended.
l. 16: again, is this sex ratio? Best not to switch between terms.
This has been amended as above.
l. 18-19: True, but when the change in glucose level in the daughter, apparently not
related to maternal treatment, was included in the analysis, this effect disappeared.
We have discussed this issue further on in the discussion, regarding the treatment
application process.
l. 21-22: well, no, because the treatment had no effect on daughter glucose.
We have adjusted this accordingly.
P. 12 l.12: This statement may require a model selection approach to be justified. For
now, the results just seem to show that the treatment effect disappears when glucose
changes are accounted for.
This statement has been adjusted accordingly.
Reviewer: 2
Specific comments:
1. The experimental approach looks fine to me, although I was wondering why late
gestation period was manipulated only? Perhaps this should be explained in more
detail.
Late gestation is used as the treatment time because we are looking at stress
pathways, and the development of the HPA axis occurs during late gestation.
Presenting the drug at different times could result in other changes to pregnancy or
sex ratios in the first generation, which would confound the results of our study. We
have attempted to make this clearer throughout the introduction.
Moreover, the authors say (on page 7, line 9) that their manipulation resulted in
variable dosages of dexamethasone, but that this approach is preferable to injections.
While I agree with this logic, do the authors have a way to quantify the amount of
potential between-individual variation in dexamethasone levels after the treatment?
We do not have a way to quantify the amount of treatment that was ingested. Due to
evaporation of water or spillage from the drinking apparatus we cannot be sure of the
exact amount of water ingested by the animal. We cannot measure the effects of the
treatment through blood or urine collection for hormone analyses, as these
procedures also induce stress and would have negated our treatment.
My expertise does not allow me to evaluate the appropriateness of the molecular
methods used in sperm sex-determination.
2. One pup of each sex per litter was chosen to avoid pseudoreplication (page 7, line
21). I think that multilevel modeling would have been a rather straightforward
approach to account for such pseudoreplication. So, I was left wondering whether the
underlying reason for this was to just reduce the number of animals housed and not
the pseudoreplication per se?
The main reason that we did not breed all animals from the litters was due to pseudo-
replication - we believe that the ability to account for pseudo-replication statistically
does not warrant the usage of unneeded lives, so we do not disagree with the reviewer
that part of the reason was to reduce animal numbers (however, this is for ethical
reasons, and not due to housing constraints). Further to this, we utilized remaining
animals from these litters in further experiments, and therefore they were not
available to this study – however, we do not feel that it is necessary to communicate
this, as the main reason for selecting one pup was to avoid pseudo-replication.
3. I’m not totally convinced that the vehicle control and negative control groups had
equal sex ratios (page 9, line 11 onwards). First, it seems that the authors have
analyzed the differences in sex ratios by using statistical models that assume normally
distributed residuals although sex ratio data should be analyzed with logistic
regressions (Wilson & Hardy 2002). Second, in global model the p-value is very close
to (p=0.07) of being statistically significant. Moreover, the authors talk about “two
full data models” but apparently do not report the result when running the model with
three treatment groups? Given the small sample size used here and small presumed
effect sizes with respect to sex allocation (West 2009), this test in question must have
a rather low statistical power. In other words, there might be a true difference between
the vehicle control and negative control groups but the current data is unpowered to
detect it. What’s important here is whether this grouping had any bearing on the
biological interpretation of the data? I mean did the results change had you not
performed such grouping? From a statistical perspective, I cannot think of any other
reason than preserving degrees of freedom (given the small sample size) that would
justify such a grouping in this experimental design.
The grouping did not have any bearing on the biological interpretation of the data, no
results were changed as a consequence of these two categories being grouped,
regardless we have removed the grouping and analysed them separately as requested.
4. In addition to examining litter size and sex ratio, the authors also looked for the
group differences in several physiological variables recorded from focal individuals.
So, in the end, they have something like seven response variables in total, measured
from the same individuals. In statistical terms, they face a problem of multiple testing
if these response variables are correlated. The authors should thus try to control for
false positive findings by fitting e.g. MANOVA-type of models, or at least provide a
correlation matrix for those response variables.
We have replaced the ANOVAs with a MANOVA and have presented both the results
from a Pillai test and the univariate tests.
5. The authors also used GLMs to identify the variables with the highest predictive
effect on offspring and sperm sex ratio. From a statistical point of view, the good
thing here is that the authors treat sex ratio outcomes as discrete variables. The
downside of the model is that they are grossly overfitted: for example, in females the
model estimates 7 parameters (of which some might even be strongly correlated to
each other?) with only 31 observations. A common rule of thumb is that one should
have at least 10 independent observations per estimated parameter. Therefore, the
results can be seriously biased. It is very confusing that the authors use these two
different models (ANOVA and GLM) to study the same question and then these
models show different results with respect to the main hypothesis tested here. In my
opinion, this study has a clear experimental design and hypothesis and it does not
have to “predict” anything. I would thus recommend using just one model, perhaps
with some carefully (a priori) considered variables as covariates.
All statistical methods and results have been updated, and this should now be
satisfied. We have only used generalised linear models to analyse binomial data, and
a MANOVA to analyse the physical features.
Thank you for your time, and please do not hesitate to contact me should you require
anything further.
Kind regards,
Amy Edwards

Dear Andrew Dunn,
I would like to thank you for your time in considering our manuscript for publication.
Please find our resubmission containing all changes as requested by your reviewers. I
have outlined below, in detail, how our manuscript has addressed the issues outlined
by your reviewers.
We believe that the changes we have made will satisfy the concerns, and have
subsequently improved our manuscript.
Response to reviewers in italics.
Reviewer: 2
In general, the authors have been responsive to my suggestions (mainly about
statistics) and thus I have no further major issues about the study. However, there was
couple of things in the Statistics/Results section that caught my eye.
First, using binary logistic regression the authors state that they tested the hypothesis:
“…whether the treatment group, or either control group presented with sex ratios
different to the predicted 50:50 ratios” (page 9, lines 19-21). Perhaps I missed
something but why the authors tested this hypothesis and not the hypothesis that sex
ratios differed between the treatment groups?
We test whether the treatment groups differed from 50:50 as this is the predicted
value for all normal populations. Investigating the difference between the three
groups could mask a significant shift from the predicted ratio if any of them shift in
the same direction. Investigating the difference between the groups is not as
biologically informative as investigating if the groups respond as predicted.
Further to this, the treatment effect is tested in the full-generalised linear model
and is shown to be non-significant.
Regardless, we undertook a generalised linear model with binomial error to verify
whether treatment alone influenced sex ratios, and the result (Pr(>Chi) 2,28 =
0.502) is not different to the result that is presented in the full generalised linear
model (Pr (>Chi) 2,27 =0.676). These results have not been added to the
manuscript, as they are superfluous.
Second, please explain what are the numbers e.g. in: “(GLM: -0.943, -0.161)”? 95%
confidence intervals of the point estimate?
We have now added an explanation in the methods section in regards to the
binomial generalised linear model that “These results are presented as 95%
confidence intervals of the estimate”.
Third, I think that if the omnibus test in MANOVA shows that some independent
variable has no overall influence on the responses, then there is little to gain from
providing the results of univariate tests. Therefore, perhaps the authors should report
the results of MANOVA-model only?
These results were initially included for completeness, but have now been removed
as suggested. We agree with the reviewer that they do not add substantial value to
the manuscript.
Reviewer: 3
1) The term “constraint” in sex allocation theory is connected with the prevailing
idea that vertebrates with chromosomal sex determination have little scope for
skewing sex ratio at birth because of meiosis. The meaning of “constraint” seems
different in this manuscript, so I would like that you give more details on use of this
word.
While chromosomal sex determination theoretically constrains sex ratio skews,
much research has focused on the skews that can arise post-meiosis, which is the
variation discussed here. Vertebrate sex ratios are set at fertilisation, however
variation in sex ratios may occur at fertilisation, implantation or through selective
loss of conceptuses. The field of research investigating sex allocation brings
together a large scope for control of sex ratios; therefore we disagree with the
reviewer that there is little scope as a result of meiosis.
The use of the word constraint in this context directly follows on from our previous
work as referenced in the manuscript – Edwards and Cameron 2014 [9] and
Edwards et al. 2016 [10]. Regardless, we have adjusted the phrasing from
“constraint” to “physiological constraint” to further conform to our previous use
of this term.
2) Your work is intimately linked to the concept of ‘programming’, which Lucas
(1991) defined as the capacity of environmental stimuli during critical developmental
periods to exert long-term or permanent effects on subsequent structure and function
of the organism. The concept of ‘programming” is crucial for understanding of the
outlined effects and should not be overlooked.
We agree that we should not have overlooked the concept of programming, and
have added references to both Lucas’s 1991 and 1998 publications on this topic.
3) Predictions could help to synthesize the fourth paragraph but are currently
lacking.
We have adjusted the aims paragraph to include the following predictions. “We
predict that offspring born to treated mothers will have an increased number of
glucocorticoid receptors, and therefore increased susceptibility to stress. Female
offspring may then experience increases in offspring sex ratios as a result of
increased gluconeogenesis, however we don’t predict that these changes should
influence male sperm sex ratios.”
4) Measure of body condition. The relationship between the body mass and the
body size is allometric. Thus, body mass and length values should be log-transformed.
There is significant debate in the literature regarding the use of different equations
to determine body condition. The use of log-transformed ratio indices is not
generally preferred to residual ordinary least squares regression (OLS) indices, as
the residual indices, unlike ratio indices, are independent of body size. While the
log ratio is currently the best index for predictions of female body fat in laboratory
mice, it is a residual regression of pelvic circumference and body length for the
males (Labocha et al. 2014). Currently, there stands no support in the literature
that the use of log ratio indices should be preferred to the residual OLS indices
that we have utilised in this study, therefore no changes were made to the
manuscript.
5) In figure 1 there are 36 focal males, while you say that 3 of the 40 initial litters
did not produce any males.
There was a misprint in the text, rather than the image. We have verified with the
original data set that there were in fact 4 litters that did not produce any males.
6) Page 10, lines 15 to 18. Please specify meaning of the values. In addition, it
would better to report that the sex ratio of offspring was not affected by treatment in
this paragraph.
These values have now been specified, as addressed above to Reviewer 1’s
comments.
We have also discussed the reporting of sex ratio differences between treatment
groups above in response to Reviewer 1’s comments.
7) Is there an interaction between peri-conceptual change in glucose and
treatment on sex ratio? A test of this interaction seems biologically relevant given
“environmental interactions with glucose metabolism may be more influential than
maternal effects” (page 11, line 20 and 21).
There is no interaction effect between peri-conceptual change in glucose and
treatment on sex ratio, we had therefore not included this factor in the full-
generalised linear model, to ensure the most parsimonious model was utilised.
However, as the addition of this factor does not significantly impact the results, we
have now reported the full-generalised linear model to include the interaction
effect.
8) Page 10, line 21 and 22: “the treatment did not result in a change in litter size
(F2,28 = 3.174, P = 0.057).” The traditional p-value of 0.05 is an arbitrary decision
rule and p-values are strongly influenced by sample size. You have a low sample size
(n ~ 30), so a p-value of 0.057 may correspond to a large effect size. More
information on this trend is required with a figure for example. Also, your conclusion
that there is no change in litter size according to treatment should be revised.
We understand what the reviewer is intending to say, however the use of
“arbitrary decision rules” ensure that there remains a level of consistency between
studies and reported results. To satisfy the concern of the reviewer we have
discussed the trend within the results section of the manuscript, and have attached
a graph to this letter, but not to the manuscript, as we do not feel that it is
necessary to present data in figures that is deemed non-significant.
9) It is not clear to me sometimes if you discuss your own results or others
studies. Please clarify that for example in page 11 (line 23 and 24), page 12 (line 9
and 10).
We have provided a reference for page 11 (line 23 and 24) to denote the study to
which it refers.
We have adjusted the sentence on page 12 (line 9 and 10) from “Those focal
females…” to “In this study, the focal females…” to clarify that we are discussing
the results of the present study.
10) Page 13, line 1. I agree with that but you may cite some studies in mammals
showing that males can contribute to biases in sex ratio (e.g., Gomendio et al. 2006
Science, Roed et al. 2007 PRSB, Douhard et al. 2014 Evolution).
We have added the suggested references to this statement.
Thank you for your time, and please do not hesitate to contact me should you require
anything further.
