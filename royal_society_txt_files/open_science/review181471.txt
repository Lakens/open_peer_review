label_comment_1
This paper proposed a novel network model of ecosystems in which active and inactive (or
dormant) state of nodes (species) can coexist. The model is well written, and the results clearly
showed that the introduction of inactive states of species can significantly increase the robustness
or growing process of the whole ecosystem, which is interesting.
One thing I would like to ask the authors is to discuss effects of T_w on the properties of network
structures (e.g., average degree, degree distribution, average path length, clustering coefficient),
because such analysis is basic and important in network sciences but there is almost nothing in
the current manuscript.
In addition, there are some trivial comments for the improvement of the readability of the
manuscript as follows:
-The authors mentioned their previous model (e.g., page 2, line 34, right), but it appears not
always clearly explained in the manuscript. Could you clarify the original paper of that model
and explain it briefly?
-The detail of FIG3 is not explained. Could you explain it in the main text or in its caption?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors aim to construct a model for studying the ecosystem of robustness with a small
computational complexity.
For this purpose, they introduced an inactive state of species with low fitness to the models in
their previous studies.
Inactive state is a feature in other ecosystem models which are computationally so costly.
The authors claim that their extended model with a small computational complexity showed
qualitatively similar behavior to these high-cost models.
Development of low-cost models is important for complex systems which require large-scale
simulations.
My evaluation is that the paper is publishable with minor scientific revisions.
My comments are as follows.
1. Introduction - 1st paragraph:
The authors described their questions.
They should provide some references for the questions because these questions are general
problems in statistical physics and complex system science.
2. Model:
The authors extended their "original model".
However, they do not show a paper which introduced this model.
Which are papers [2-4] of the "original model"?
The authors should show the original paper and the differences between the original model and
the extended model.
3. Model:
In the model, the parameter "a" showing relationships between species is important parameters.
However, the description of "a" is missing.
Please add description how the model provides each "a" is not described in the main manuscript.
4. Results:
The authors sometimes mention their previous studies.
However, each mention is unclear which paper it refers to.
For example, "our previous study" (L. 1 in 1st Paragraph) and "our original model without ..." (L.
4 in 1st Paragraph).
Here are the minor comments.

(Dated: January 12, 2019)
We study the robustness of an evolving system that is driven by successive inclusions of new
elements or constituents with m random interactions to older ones. Each constitutive element in
the model stays either active or is temporarily inactivated depending upon the influence of the
other active elements. If the time spent by an element in the inactivated state reaches TW , it gets
extinct. The phase diagram of this dynamic model as a function of m and TW is investigated by
numerical and analytical methods and as a result both growing (robust) as well as non-growing
(volatile) phases are identified. It is also found that larger time limit TW enhances the system’s
robustness against the inclusion of new elements, mainly due to the system’s increased ability to
reject “falling-together” type attacks. Our results suggest that the ability of an element to survive
in an unfavorable situation for a while, either as a minority or in a dormant state, could improve
the robustness of the entire system.
