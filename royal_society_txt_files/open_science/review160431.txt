This paper proposes two direct replications of studies published by Heintzelman, Trent, and King
that showed that the presence of patterns and associative links among environmental stimuli led
to higher reports of meaning in life. In particular, the investigators plan to replicate a study in
which photographs of trees were presented in a systematic pattern (based on seasonal content) or
random fashion and a study in which participants read word incoherent or coherent word triads.
1. The importance of the research question(s).
Self-reports of meaning in life are associated with numerous positive outcomes so understanding
what contributes to the experience of meaning in life is an important goal.
2. The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
The logic and rationale of the studies (as well as the hypotheses) are borrowed from the original
publication. It might be of interest for the authors to consider alternative explanations or
hypotheses that might suggest additional conditions in order to expand the contributions of this
work. Replication is certainly important but it is not clear that the level of original contribution is
appropriate to this journal. Certainly, to me the original hypotheses were reasonable but perhaps
the authors disagree?
3. The soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical
power analysis where applicable).
The analyses appear to be quite appropriate.
4. Whether the clarity and degree of methodological detail would be sufficient to replicate the
proposed experimental procedures and analysis pipeline.
I believe that the information given would certainly allow for replication.
5. Whether the authors provide a sufficiently clear and detailed description of the methods to
prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedures or analysis pipeline.
It appears that the method and analytic procedures are definitely spelled out appropriately and
avoid the risk of flexibility.
6. Whether the authors have considered sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. absence of
floor or ceiling effects; positive controls; other quality checks) for ensuring that the results
obtained are able to test the stated hypotheses.
One possibility would to include a true neutral control. The original studies that are being
replicated did not include a control group that did nothing. Such a group might be useful
comparison. If the results did replicate the previous work, the addition of a (baseline, no
intervention) control group would disambiguate an issue in those original studies.

This preregistered replication of Heintzelman, Trent, & King (2013) represents a strong and well-
planned proposal to replicate the studies of interest. The methods and statistical analyses
proposed are true to the original studies and the increased sample sizes are a strength of this
replication attempt.
I have two concerns regarding the introduction of this proposal for consideration, though neither
point detracts from my assessment of the quality of the replication proposal itself as satisfactory.
First, the authors suggest that the approach (presumably presenting coherence to individuals
through the paradigms used in this work) could be honed to help groups to find meaning in life
(p. 4). I would suggest caution in making such a bold claim. These methods were developed to
test the theoretical association between the detection of coherence and feelings of meaning in life
in a very controlled setting. Clearly, these laboratory procedures, while they can be leveraged to
test this effect in a controlled experiment, are quite circumscribed. The duration of the effects or
the incorporation of these procedures into a more naturalistic setting have not been tested and are
not likely to have long-term and widespread effects given the complex and multiply determined
assessments of meaning in life “in the wild.” These studies might suggest the value of increasing
the coherence in a person’s life would improve the sense of meaning a person feels, but I would
not advocate for simply extracting these laboratory manipulations for use in an uncontrolled
naturalistic application.
Second, the authors’ discussion of the MMM in relation to the present work is somewhat
imprecise. They state that “In experiments testing the MMM, meaning tends to be bolstered…”
(p. 5), and “Although outcomes associated with perceived meaning in life have been utilized in
MMM-related paradigms” (p. 5). In fact, work in MMM has never established a link between
their outcomes (artificial grammar task and prostitute bail task) and meaning in life. Work we
have in progress suggests that these outcomes are wholly unrelated to meaning in life. As such,
the discrepancies between the studies of interest and the MMM are not as pronounced as the
authors seem to suggest.
Overall, this submission represents a strong replication proposal to test the effects of these two
methods for examining the relationship between exposure to coherence and ratings of meaning in
life.

Comments to the Author:
At the outset please accept my apologies for the delay in communicating this decision letter. We
had originally consulted three reviewers but one became non-responsive. We are therefore
proceeding with the two reviews provided.
As you will see, both reviews are very positive and the manuscript should be suitable for in
principle acceptance following a round of minor revision. Reviewer 1 suggests that "Replication is
certainly important but it is not clear that the level of original contribution is appropriate to this
journal." Please note that this concern does not apply for Registered Reports, which explicitly
welcome replications of important studies. The reviewer also makes an interesting suggestion for
the inclusion of a non-intervention control group, so please consider carefully whether this would
be a valuable addition to the study. Reviewer 2 raises no concerns about the methodology but
recommends clarification of several key points in the Introduction.

This manuscript to reported a fair and diligent replication of a pair of studies on which I was an
author. I am (not surprisingly) surprised the results did not replicate ours but I feel that the
presentation here is quite reasonable. I was especially impressed by the balanced treatment of the
results in the discussion.
I have only a few thoughts to add.
First, I do not think that immediately turning to applications of the original idea (that exposure to
pattern might enhance meaning in life and that could be used as an intervention) was on the
minds of the authors of the original paper. The authors of this paper mention more than once that
this would be a logical extension of that work. Heintzelman, Trent, & King, instead, were more
focused on showing that coherence matters to meaning in life, full stop. To me, the notion that if
those results were replicable one would do implement some kind of immediate intervention goes
far beyond what the original authors intended.
A second issue that occurred to me was that the authors might talk a bit more about the
conceptual thrust of the original paper (and other papers not by our team): that the experience of
meaning and purpose (or existential comfort more generally) can be influenced by
structure/pattern. (Relevant research comes from Terror Management Theory as well as Aaron
Kay's lab). Would this failure to replicate call that conceptual point into question or is this more
about unreliable effects of two operationalizations of structure/pattern/sense?
Third, I think it is worth noting that H, T, & K did not expect results on any of the variables
measured other than meaning in life--these were included as control variables. In that sense, not
finding effects on these is in line with those expectations. (It is not always clear in the report that
those null effects are not "failure to replicate"--those effects did not and were not expected to
emerge in the original paper).
Finally, I would note that it seems expected to consider "hidden moderators" in these situations. I
don't necessarily feel that such is warranted here but one that occurred to me was time of year
(particularly for the tree studies). I honestly do not remember when we collected the data but I do
remember many participants praising the pictures of the trees. It may be (again, I honestly do not
recall) that being exposed to these tree pictures during a particular time of year would influence
the quality of the experience. The changing seasons may mean different things in the winter, vs.
spring. vs. summer, etc. On a related point, it is not clear from the original paper nor from the
current one whether folks were aware of the pattern or associations in the stimuli and this might
be an ambiguity that would explain differing results.
I cannot help but notice the seasonal group was "highest" on meaning in life in the replication of
that study and so I have not lost hope about this particular manipulation. I believe that we
showed something that can happen (and that did happen twice each). I am happy to see others
trying to find out if what we showed can happen will happen consistently. Overall, I appreciate
the seriousness and care with which these authors treated our ideas.

Comments to the Author(s)

This paper presents a rigorous and fair replication attempt of two studies examining the effects of
exposures to coherence on the experience of meaning in life. As an author on the original paper, I
am, as you might expect, disappointed these effects were not replicated here. However, I
appreciate the authors’ thorough efforts, demonstrated through our email exchanges, their
proposal, and the work presented here. Furthermore, I commend their measured approach to the
discussion section.
I have a few notes that the authors might consider in the presentation of these studies, though
none challenge the quality of the studies themselves. Merely some things that could help readers
to understand these studies situated within the context of this area of research.
The methods used in both of the studies were true to the original designs. However, there is one
point of difference that might warrant discussion—the use of attention check items embedded
within the meaning in life measures. These items were included in the original proposal and it
didn’t strike me as so important as to challenge at that time, so I fully acknowledge that this
statement is a post-hoc search for any potential differences. However, given the diligence with
which the authors showed in creating an exact replica of our initial experiments, this remains one
thing that is different. Although I will not go so far as to say the inclusion of these items are the
reason these findings did not replicate, the fact that this is a methodological difference between
the studies seems to warrant a mention, however brief, in the paper. Whether this could actually
make a difference is certainly an empirical question, but I could see how such an item might alter
the mindset with which participants are approaching the subsequent items. Some of our other
work shows how MIL is related to intuitive cognitive processing. This item might be enough to
have them pause and change to more rational thought processes and could potentially shift their
responses to the later items. Whether this would make a difference is certainly an empirical
question, yet at this time it seems to warrant at least pointing out that this is a difference between
the two methodologies.
I found the description of the meta-analytic tests to be a bit unclear in the results section. It took
me several reads to figure out which studies were included in these. The discussion section
eventually clarified that these were the original studies (2 & 4 of ours) and their two studies, but I
was unclear until while I was reading the results. This section could benefit from more clarity.
Furthermore, it seems strange to exclude the additional two studies from the original paper (1 &
3) from these analyses.
In a paper centrally aimed to examine the replicability of work in this area, the authors seem to
grant the MMM literature a pass. Studies in these areas are greatly underpowered, never directly
replicated, and deal in shifting DVs. Allowing these studies such a central role in the discussion
of failures to replicate the current studies seems unbalanced.
Finally, the authors and I (as well as readers interested in this work) seem to share a goal of
reaching a more complete understanding of what this work and this failure to replicate mean for
this line of research and I was pleased to see this motivation come across in this paper. However,
I also think this pursuit could greatly benefit from an inclusion of the theoretical underpinnings
of this work and a discussion of other findings related to the conclusions drawn in the original
papers. The discussion of this work seems overly constrained to the target studies while ignoring
the building body of work in this area. For one example, Aaron Kay and colleagues have some
10
nice work showing that exposure to coherence encourages goal pursuit, a process heavily tied to
meaning in life. Similarly Matt Vess and colleagues have examined need for structure and
meaning in life. As an aside, my subsequent work has also supported the broader conclusions
drawn in the original paper—that coherence positively relates and can lead to feelings of
meaning. Since these papers are still in progress, I certainly do not expect the authors to include
these, but I do think this knowledge might encourage them to take a broader view of this work,
not restrained to these methods, specifically. At times, the authors seem caught between an even-
handed approach to what a failure to replicate certain results following specific methodologies
really means for that finding while leaving out a discussion of what not replicating this finding
using these methodologies means (or doesn’t mean) in the context of this line of work more
broadly.
As a whole, I believe the authors present a well-conducted replication attempt to this study and
again, I’d like to thank them for taking such an even-handed approach to this important process.

Both reviewers have responded very positively to the Stage 2 submission and review criteria
have been met. The reviewers offer some minor suggestions for consideration in the Discussion,
therefore a minor revision is recommended. In particular, consideration of possible moderators
such as the inclusion of the attention check task and potential time of year effects may be
warranted as it may help frame these moderators as a priori study variables in future studies.

I cannot help but notice the seasonal group was "highest" on meaning in life in the replication of
that study and so I have not lost hope about this particular manipulation. I believe that we
showed something that can happen (and that did happen twice each). I am happy to see others
trying to find out if what we showed can happen will happen consistently. Overall, I appreciate
the seriousness and care with which these authors treated our ideas.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper presents a rigorous and fair replication attempt of two studies examining the effects of
exposures to coherence on the experience of meaning in life. As an author on the original paper, I
am, as you might expect, disappointed these effects were not replicated here. However, I
appreciate the authors’ thorough efforts, demonstrated through our email exchanges, their
proposal, and the work presented here. Furthermore, I commend their measured approach to the
discussion section.
I have a few notes that the authors might consider in the presentation of these studies, though
none challenge the quality of the studies themselves. Merely some things that could help readers
to understand these studies situated within the context of this area of research.
The methods used in both of the studies were true to the original designs. However, there is one
point of difference that might warrant discussion—the use of attention check items embedded
within the meaning in life measures. These items were included in the original proposal and it
didn’t strike me as so important as to challenge at that time, so I fully acknowledge that this
14
statement is a post-hoc search for any potential differences. However, given the diligence with
which the authors showed in creating an exact replica of our initial experiments, this remains one
thing that is different. Although I will not go so far as to say the inclusion of these items are the
reason these findings did not replicate, the fact that this is a methodological difference between
the studies seems to warrant a mention, however brief, in the paper. Whether this could actually
make a difference is certainly an empirical question, but I could see how such an item might alter
the mindset with which participants are approaching the subsequent items. Some of our other
work shows how MIL is related to intuitive cognitive processing. This item might be enough to
have them pause and change to more rational thought processes and could potentially shift their
responses to the later items. Whether this would make a difference is certainly an empirical
question, yet at this time it seems to warrant at least pointing out that this is a difference between
the two methodologies.
I found the description of the meta-analytic tests to be a bit unclear in the results section. It took
me several reads to figure out which studies were included in these. The discussion section
eventually clarified that these were the original studies (2 & 4 of ours) and their two studies, but I
was unclear until while I was reading the results. This section could benefit from more clarity.
Furthermore, it seems strange to exclude the additional two studies from the original paper (1 &
3) from these analyses.
In a paper centrally aimed to examine the replicability of work in this area, the authors seem to
grant the MMM literature a pass. Studies in these areas are greatly underpowered, never directly
replicated, and deal in shifting DVs. Allowing these studies such a central role in the discussion
of failures to replicate the current studies seems unbalanced.
Finally, the authors and I (as well as readers interested in this work) seem to share a goal of
reaching a more complete understanding of what this work and this failure to replicate mean for
this line of research and I was pleased to see this motivation come across in this paper. However,
I also think this pursuit could greatly benefit from an inclusion of the theoretical underpinnings
of this work and a discussion of other findings related to the conclusions drawn in the original
papers. The discussion of this work seems overly constrained to the target studies while ignoring
the building body of work in this area. For one example, Aaron Kay and colleagues have some
nice work showing that exposure to coherence encourages goal pursuit, a process heavily tied to
meaning in life. Similarly Matt Vess and colleagues have examined need for structure and
meaning in life. As an aside, my subsequent work has also supported the broader conclusions
drawn in the original paper—that coherence positively relates and can lead to feelings of
meaning. Since these papers are still in progress, I certainly do not expect the authors to include
these, but I do think this knowledge might encourage them to take a broader view of this work,
not restrained to these methods, specifically. At times, the authors seem caught between an even-
handed approach to what a failure to replicate certain results following specific methodologies
really means for that finding while leaving out a discussion of what not replicating this finding
using these methodologies means (or doesn’t mean) in the context of this line of work more
broadly.
As a whole, I believe the authors present a well-conducted replication attempt to this study and
again, I’d like to thank them for taking such an even-handed approach to this important process.

r Drs. Dunn and Chambers,
ached is a revision of our manuscript (RSOS-160285) entitled, “The Effects of Exposure to Objective
erence on Perceived Meaning in Life: A Preregistered Direct Replication of Heintzelman, Trent, and
g (2013)” for consideration for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
are very thankful for the comments and suggestions put forth by the editor and both reviewers. We
also grateful for the invitation to resubmit to your journal following these minor revisions. We have
ught carefully about each of the edits and have outlined our responses and changes below. Our list
esponds to the order in which the comments were presented in the decision letter:
iewer #1:
1. Regarding the reviewer’s comments on the logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed
hypotheses, we can say that we found the original authors’ conceptual framework and
interpretation feasible. In the introduction of the paper, we feel that it might be most prudent and
appropriate to adhere, as closely as possible, to what was presented in the original Heintzelman et
al. (2013) paper. Adding our own interpretations for the effect of interest might be better suited
for the discussion, especially if the effect replicates. We will certainly keep this point in mind
when we are in the final writing phase of this project.
2. The suggestion to add a control group to our study design was a thoughtful one – adding a passive
control group could certainly help to more fully illuminate the nature of the effect shown in the
original paper. We have a few concerns about adding a passive control condition to our
replication at this time, however. First, we do not want to deviate too far from the original paper,
as our intent is to conduct a direct replication of Heintzelman et al. (2013). With this said, we do
think that adding a control group would be an excellent future direction for us to suggest in the
discussion should the effects of interest replicate. Second, adding a control group to both of our
replications would necessitate nearly 300 additional participants. We feel that this additional
expenditure may unnecessarily tax our limited resources without first knowing whether or not the
original effects will replicate.
iewer #2:
1. We appreciate the cautionary note here and agree that perhaps the original sentences were
ambitiously worded. The two sentences alluding to intervention (p.4) have been toned down and
now read:
“Should this effect exist, it would have tremendous theoretical implications, especially for those
interested in understanding what factors influence this unequivocally beneficial sense. Although
still a very distal goal, taking these first steps and understanding the mechanisms of how the
environment influences perceived meaning may eventually inform the ways we try to help
vulnerable groups (e.g., Ratner & Berman, 2015) detect a reliable sense of meaning in life.”
Pinning down the mechanisms of a phenomenon is indeed the first step toward any intervention
and we hope that our edits make the section more realistic. We have attempted to frame the
effects of this study as simply one component of potential future intervention (rather than the
magic ingredient).
2. We are grateful for these catches. To address the ambiguity present within the first identified
sentence (p.5), we have revised the sentence to read:
“In experiments testing the MMM, the imposition of meaning onto alternative sources tends to
occur following exposure to violations in expectancy.”
We see how our original statement is not synonymous with “the imposition of meaning in other
areas” and is thus imprecise. With regard to the second sentence identified (p.5), we have deleted
the first half of the sentence. It now reads:
“Until Heintzelman et al. (2013), no studies have explicitly measured subjective reports of
meaning in life following exposure to a potential meaning threat in traditional MMM-fashion
(i.e., following exposure to a violation in expectancy).”
In our view as well, this is more accurate. We revisited the citations we had in that section and,
upon further inspection, realized that one did not use traditional MMM methodology (rather, they
primed meaninglessness and claimed to induce a meaning threat by flashing cues such as “futile”
and “empty” to participants in one condition – this is not exactly the “violation in expectancy” on
which we predicate the present studies and Heine et al. [2006] used in their original studies) and
the other was a stretch at best. Again, we are very appreciative to have had these points
highlighted, thus, giving us the opportunity to make appropriate corrections.
believe we have fully addressed the thoughtful comments and suggestions provided by the reviewers,
that our revised manuscript has been discernibly improved. We look forward to receiving your
ision. If these changes are found to be suitable, our next step is to officially submit our full protocol to
Open Science Framework for registration (estimated to be 10 business days). Following acceptance to
h the journal and OSF, we will begin data collection immediately.

Dear Drs. Dunn and Chambers,
Attached is a revision of our completed manuscript (RSOS-160431.R1) entitled, “The Effects
of Exposure to Objective Coherence on Perceived Meaning in Life: A Preregistered Direct
Replication of Heintzelman, Trent, and King (2013)” for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
We are very thankful for the comments and suggestions put forth by the editor and both
reviewers. In particular, we are especially appreciative of the note that both reviewers gave
with regard to our careful handling of the discussion section. We are very sensitive to the
nature of replications (especially in the cases where another lab fails to replicate previous
findings), so it was very important to us that the original authors did not feel that we were
engaged in a “witch hunt.” We are also grateful that you have found our completed
manuscript suitable for publication following these minor revisions. We have thought
carefully about each of the edits and have outlined our responses and changes below. Our
list corresponds to the order in which the comments appear in the decision letter:
To the Editor:
1. Please see our changes as outlined below with respect to specific suggestions put
forth by the reviewers. We have now included mentions of potential hidden
moderators that future literature may wish to investigate.
Reviewer #1:
1. We are sensitive to the concern of the authors’ intent of the original study as basic,
rather than applied, research. We attempted to scale back on the focus of this
manipulation as an intervention during the Stage 1 revision and have now included
a reminder of this in the last paragraph of our completed manuscript on p. 27. Our
final sentence has been augmented and now reads, “Although it was not an end
goal of the original paper, every small step toward illuminating this process serves
as another step toward researchers discovering effective ways to help all
individuals secure this elusive, yet coveted, sense and work their way toward
psychological flourishing.”
2. We hope to have addressed this point about how our findings may affect the
broader scope of research on structure/patterns as relevant to sensing meaning in
life in a series of additions – please see our final two responses to the comments of
Reviewer #2.
3. To address this point about replicating certain effects with control variables, we
have modified a sentence on p. 26 in an effort to make this more clear. Specifically,
we have taken out any mention of hypotheses. The relevant sentence now reads,
“Finally, it is important to highlight that not all of the findings in the present studies
failed to reach indicated thresholds for significance. Rather, a reliable correlation
between explicit affect and perceived meaning in life was demonstrated. Replicated
across both of the present studies, it appears that individuals who report more
positive affect also tend to report higher feelings of perceived meaning in life.”
When we say “replicated” and “reliable” in this small section, we are alluding to
intra-study consistency. That is, we were able to show this effect twice.
4. Although there is always the potential for hidden moderators, we felt split on
whether or not to bring up the exact examples listed in this review in our paper. We
ultimately decided not to discuss the potential for moderation by time of year or
detected pattern simply because there is indeed ambiguity surrounding these
moderators across both the original and replication studies. If we cannot be sure
when the original study was completed with relation to the time of year, we cannot
make inferences about such potential moderation in our paper. For future
reference though, if this is indeed an area of potential interest, the briefly-
mentioned conceptual replications which sparked the current endeavor were
completed in the fall and beginning of winter of 2015 and both present direct
replications were completed during the summer of 2016. With regard to whether
or not a pattern was detected, we can anecdotally say that our participants did not
seem to be aware of any explicit patterns in stimuli presentation (many comments
alluded to the fact that they saw a series of “pretty trees”). We would be more than
happy to add this as a footnote at the request of the editor, but since no analyses
were completed in the original paper on patterns reported in the optional survey
question, we declined to code and analyze this question in our own data. Indeed,
this might be an interesting empirical question for the future. We did, however,
discuss a potential moderator brought up by Reviewer #2 (please see response #1).
Reviewer #2:
1. We thought this this was a very fair point of Reviewer #2 to suggest. We have
added a discussion of this potential difference in our “areas for future research”
section on p. 26-27. In short, attention checks seem to generally good and
recommended for MTurk studies, but there is indeed at least one study which has
shown that participants respond differently after being exposed to a “tricky”
attention check (Hauser & Schwarz, 2015). Our attention check was overt and
explicit, so we hope that this would not prompt participants to respond to
questions differently based on this encounter, but it is indeed an interesting
empirical question which could be tested in the future.
2. We also appreciated this point about our meta-analytic approach. We have made
substantial revisions to this section in hopes that it is more accessible. More
importantly, however, we took to heart the concern about our exclusion of studies
1 and 3 from the meta-analysis. Indeed, all four of the original studies were testing
the same focal effect, so it seemed sensible to include them in our meta-analysis.
We estimated our unadjusted and adjusted meta-analytic effects sizes pooling
across all studies of the original paper and our replicated effects (p. 21-22). When
our two replication attempts were entered alongside the four original studies, the
pooled effect size estimate came out to be statistically different from zero across
both unadjusted and adjusted aggregate effects. This is in large contrast to our
analyses pooling only our replications with Studies 2 and 4 from the original paper.
Importantly, there seemed to be significant moderation of status as an original or
replication effect size and the pooled effect sizes (d = .25 and .21) appear smaller
than the effects of the original investigations. We changed the discussion of these
results on p. 24 to fit with the new findings.
3. On p. 26, we have added a fourth area for future research focused on investigating
the foundational building blocks of the original study (namely, as you have pointed
out, replication of the MMM).
4. In addressing comment #3, we have also broadened the focus and added a warning
against becoming myopic in replication studies. While replications of certain effects
are important, a more efficient route for replications might be a “bottom-up”
approach (mentioned on p. 26). Further, we make mention of the studies by Kay
and Vess (p.27) to make sure that others’ investigations of the relationship
between structure and meaning has been mentioned our paper. Indeed, this
process seems to be relatively well-established which makes our findings all the
more discrepant and perplexing. We hope that by calling into question “potential
boundary conditions which may contour” this established association (p.27) we
have at least partially satisfied the concern highlighted here in the final comment.
We believe we have fully addressed the thoughtful comments and suggestions provided by
the reviewers and that our revised manuscript has been discernibly improved. We look
forward to receiving your decision. Following final acceptance to the journal, we will be
completing the entry with OSF and uploading all supplementary materials to the
preregistered repository as indicated in our manuscript.
