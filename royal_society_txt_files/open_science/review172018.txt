The paper presents the development of a one-dimensional, two-layer depth-averaged sediment
transport model for bedload-dominated problems, with limited suspended load being also
allowed. In this model, the horizontal velocity and sediment concentration are assumed uniform
with depth in each layer, but they vary in time and horizontal space. The authors derived the
water-sediment mass and momentum equations by applying conservation laws, and provided all
of the assumptions required. They then derived the shear stresses and erosion rate functions and
the mass and momentum fluxes through the layer interfaces.
The two-layer model was then validated for the case of steady uniform flow over an erodible bed.
The bedload transport rate predicted by the present model agreed well with several existing
empirical and semi-empirical bedload formulations. The model was further used to reproduce a
physical experiment of a migration mining pit due to bedload transport. With the introduction of
a further calibration parameter, the pit migration process was satisfactorily replicated.
The two-layer model was utilized to derive an expression for morphological diffusivity, which
was incorporated into a conventional morphodynamic model to reproduce the process of mining
pit migration.
The paper is well written and organized. The work is conducted in a methodical manner. The
research is new and technically sound.

The paper relates to an active research topic of morphodynamics in water systems such as coastal
areas and rivers. It proposes a novel two-layer model that consists of five mass and momentum
balance equations and a few more equations describing conditions at the interfaces between the
bed and two flow layers. The model is well described and its properties are comprehensively
explored in the paper, including analytical and experimental validations. The authors
convincingly show that fairly simple balance considerations predict the available empirical
equations for bedload very well. I found the paper to be well-structured, clearly and, I would say,
elegantly written. In this respect it may serve as an example of how to write papers, particularly
for emerging researchers. I of course highly recommend this manuscript for publication as it fits
all key publication requirements: novelty, significance, relevance, and clarity. In principle, this is
a rare case when a manuscript could be sent to production straightaway.
However, below I have a few suggestions for the authors to consider that may further enhance
the paper, although these suggestions are not 'must-do'.
P. 1: The Abstract is clear and reflects the paper content well. I have only one suggestion that the
authors may consider. Their sentence “Sediment is allowed to enter the upper layer when the
bedload layer has reached saturation, and so total load may also be simulated, provided that
concentrations of suspended sediment remain low” suggests that ‘bebload particles’ may become
‘suspended particles’ not because, e.g., of increase in turbulence (i.e., with increase in ratio of
shear velocity to particle settling velocity) but because of saturation of the bedload layer. This
may potentially confuse the reader – slight editing can fix it.
P. 2, L. 8: should it be ‘consists’?
P. 2, L. 9: Do you mean depth-averaged equations when write ‘hydrodynamic equations’? If so
then it would be good to state it explicitly to avoid confusion when you talk about ‘alternative …
two-layer models’ later. If you mean 3D equations then it may not be clear why two-layer models
are better than CM. Also, I suggest considering ‘flow momentum equations’ instead of
‘hydrodynamic equations’ which is too general (unless other hydrodynamic equations like
energy equations are also involved in CM).
P. 2, L. 17: consider replacing reference [2] with a recent reference, as reference [2] may be viewed
as pretty outdated to support a statement that clear criteria for subdividing sediments into
bedload and suspended load remain absent.
P. 2, L. 45: ‘horizontal plane’ – should it be a plane parallel to the mean bed?
P. 2, L 55: You start here to use term ‘morphological diffusion’. From your text it follows that
‘morphological diffusion’ is an ‘expression for the bed slope effect on bedload’. I suggest that
here you provide a very brief explanation so the reader will not be confused with the use of the
term ‘diffusion’ as it may mean different things. I realise that section 4 provides all details, but a
short explanation would be helpful here too.
4
P. 3, L. 24-27: Is the bed assumed to be horizontal (i.e., “the horizontal plane”)? Is ‘horizontal’
velocity a vector? Is it instantaneous or time-averaged velocity? In what respect “1D version of
the model”? Within each layer? You mention that horizontal velocity may change in space and
thus the model cannot be 1D? I feel that the text needs some sharpening here as well as an explicit
definition of the coordinate system with a sketch.
P. 5, Fig. 2: The arrows in the figure show that momentum is transferred from the bed to Layer 0
and then to Layer 1. Reality seems opposite? Or arrows show direction of the axes? Please check
and correct. Also, please use consistent symbols for defining the layers as they are different in
Fig. 1 (U.L., L.L.) and Fig. 2 (L1, Lo, Lb).
P. 5, Eqs 2.1a-to 2.1f: Although it may look trivial, I do suggest adding a sketch with a coordinate
system as it may help interpret these equations (and also definitions of the key variables).
P. 5, L. 37: Here you define u as ‘depth-averaged horizontal velocity”. However, several lines
above (and in Fig. 1) you state that u is horizontal velocity assumed to be constant over a layer.
Please check the text for consistency of definitions to avoid misinterpretations (e.g., do you really
need an assumption of vertically uniform velocity?) if you deal with depth-averaged velocity?
P. 6, L. 9: I do not think that the use of ‘single-valued’ in “momentum flux has to be single-
valued” is appropriate. Please check.
P. 6, L. 10: Please consider adding a brief justification for the jump condition for momentum flux.
It underpins key Eq. 2.2 and therefore physical reasons behind it would need a brief explanation.
P. 1, L. 8: A short remark is required here when you state “For steady uniform flow that…”. Can
flow be uniform if it is gravity-driven and the bed is horizontal?
P. 17, Conclusions: Consider adding a few sentences regarding potential use of the proposed
model and associated findings for further research and for applications, with an explicate outline
of limitations of your results.

The arrows indicate the flux direction taken arbitrarily as positive; i.e. upwards (this has
n highlighted in the manuscript). Abbreviations in Fig. 1 have been changed to be consistent
h the rest of the paper.
, Eqs 2.1a-to 2.1f: Although it may look trivial, I do suggest adding a sketch with a
rdinate system as it may help interpret these equations (and also definitions of the key
iables).
hank you for the suggestion. We have added the coordinate system to the definition sketch.
, L. 37: Here you define u as ‘depth-averaged horizontal velocity”. However, several lines
ve (and in Fig. 1) you state that u is horizontal velocity assumed to be constant over a layer.
ase check the text for consistency of definitions to avoid misinterpretations (e.g., do you
ly need an assumption of vertically uniform velocity?) if you deal with depth-averaged
ocity?
hank you. We have checked the paper thoroughly for consistency in definition of variables,
added a list of symbols at the end of the manuscript following Referee 1’s
ommendation. We have now consistently defined u as having a uniform vertical distribution
hin each layer. Uniformity in the velocity distribution is adopted in this first stage of model
elopment simply to avoid use of additional parameters, such as Boussinesq coefficient,
ch should otherwise be present in a (layer-)depth-averaged model like the one herein
ployed.
, L. 9: I do not think that the use of ‘single-valued’ in “momentum flux has to be single-
ued” is appropriate. Please check.
y ‘single-valued’ we mean that evaluation of momentum flux through a given interface
st be independent of whether variables from the top or bottom of said interface are invoked
. both options should yield the same result). The term itself (single-valued) is borrowed from
scientific literature concerned with similar two-layer models.
, L. 10: Please consider adding a brief justification for the jump condition for momentum
. It underpins key Eq. 2.2 and therefore physical reasons behind it would need a brief
lanation.
We have tried to state at the beginning of the section what the physical interpretation of this
p condition is. For the sake of brevity (the manuscript is already relatively long), we then
er the reader to further literature where this concept is treated in depth, such as in [5], [6]
[16].
, L. 8: A short remark is required here when you state “For steady uniform flow that…”. Can
w be uniform if it is gravity-driven and the bed is horizontal?
We hope this confusion is now resolved with the rewriting of Section 2.a, where we state
t by ‘horizontal’ we will actually be referring throughout the manuscript to nearly-horizontal
s (the small bed slope assumption being typical of shallow/hydrostatic flows models), where
vity action can thus lead to uniform flow.
7, Conclusions: Consider adding a few sentences regarding potential use of the proposed
del and associated findings for further research and for applications, with an explicate outline
imitations of your results.
We have now added a few lines on potential uses for the work here presented and its
itations.
