The manuscript titled "Chitinase genes from Metarhizium anisopliae for the control of Whitefly in
Cotton" adds up valuable research output to plant pathology. The study appears to be authentic
and may play significant role to potentially control insect pests causing spread of devastating
viral diseases by employing chitinase genes from fungal strain M. anisopliae.
Following are minor comments to be considered,
Methodology part:
2.6.4. clarify that the number of seedlings and pots were set up in the experiment.
Results section.
Figures 2 & 3, can be supplementary files.
3.5. Expression of chitinase in cotton plants. It is obvious that the genes were detected based on
end-point PCR and the data was validated by phenotypic expression. Since real expression of
genes by real-time quantitative has not been done, therefore, here expression may be replaced by
detection and confirmation of chitinase in cotton plants.

Dear Authors;
Whiteflies are small Hemipterans that typically feed on the undersides of cotton leaves. They
comprise the family Aleyrodidae, the only family in the superfamily Aleyrodoidea. More than
1550 species have been described.
3
In warm or tropical climates and especially in fields, whiteflies present major problems in cotton
protection. Worldwide economic losses are estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars annually
for cotton business.
Therefor, the presnt study was designed for the harmfull effects with using genetically modified
technology. This is a original research with finding n results.
I am strongly suggested that "accepted with minor correction".

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
5
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi

can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Stephen Long):
This study appears novel and has potential for control of insect pests. Both reviewers
recommend publication, subject to addressing some remaining points. Reviewer #1 notes the
inadequacy in detailing the experimental design and also interpretation of the PCR - these must
be addressed. I will review the final version of the ms for acceptability.
