General Comments:
This study by Ramsey et al. is a valuable analysis of Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) protein expression
associated with age, symbiont, and Liberibacter infection. The authors identify several proteins
that interact with either the vector, or the pathogen (CLas), and demonstrate upregulation of
mucin and hemocyanin may facilitate CLas infection.
The conclusions are generally supported by the results; however, there are a number of
methodological questions (discussed below) that should be addressed, particularly with regard to
information about insect cultures and the number of samples analyzed. In addition, some of the
conclusions were overly speculative given that experiments were not designed to test the
observed changes in gene expression in response to CLas (see specifics below).
Another issue of concern was that the authors disregarded a great deal of the recent literature
concerning ACP biology, symbiont interactions, and protein analysis. Several recent papers have
previously characterized ACP protein expression (e.g. Lu. et al 2016, El-Shesheny et al. 2015).
ACP transcriptomics, fitness, transmission, and endosymbiont interactions have been the focus of
a significant body of recent literature. Some of these references are provided below. The authors
should the address current ACP literature, and also refrain defaulting to comparisons of ACP
with another pathosystem (Zebra Chip- potato psyllid) when ACP-specific studies are available.
Specific comments:
Methods: How many insects were used for the study, and how many replicates? Were replicate
insects obtained from different host plants? Where did insect colonies originate (location) and
how long has the culture been maintained? What were the environmental conditions? Was
peptide quantification conducted on the same individuals that were analyzed by qPCR? If not,
what was the infection rate of the CLas+ population?
Discussion: Organization of the discussion could be improved by discussing hemocyanin 1 in a
single section, rather than interspersing with discussion of hemocyanins 2 and 3. As it stands,
this is somewhat difficult to follow. I suggest moving the two paragraphs beginning on l. 350 to
follow the paragraph ending on l. 335.
l. 45: A more recent reference than (4) should be provided.
l. 53-54: This is an incorrect statement. Several studies have demonstrated transovarial
transmission (Stelinski et al. 2010, Mann 2011). This is discussed in (5) and in (1) by Grafton-
Cardwell 2013.
l. 65-67: Some fitness cost to D. citri infection with Las does occur, see Pelz-Stelinski 2015, which
is a more relevant references than (9). Also see Vyas et al. 2015.
l.298: This is interesting. The speculation that increased hemocyanin expression is associated with
CLas, and may underlie blue abdominal color, would suggest more CLas infected ACP would
appear blue. Is that true? Did you quantify hemocyanin 1 expression in blue-green vs. yellow-
orange-brown individuals? This would be straightforward to do and provide support for an
otherwise speculative conclusion.
l. 290-291: Change to “were reared”
3
l. Overly speculative to suggest that missing immune genes are a general feature of Hemipterans
based on (32). That said, Vyas etl al. offers some support for reduced ACP immunity.
l. 370-371: Again, there are more relevant references that should be included. ACP P450 was
characterized by Tiwari et al. Why would these references be omitted in lieu of references to
aphid P450?
l. 378: “stress associated with… and feeding from CLas-infected plants.” This is overly
speculative, since stress due to plant infection was not measured independently from stress
associated with CLas infection. Stress due to plant infection, and associated nutrient deficiency,
would possibly differ to a response associated with pathogen infection of the vector. This should
be clarified.
Poor nutritional quality should be addressed as an independent factor, to the extent that it can,
such as by rearing adults from all treatments on a CLas-, non-susceptible host.

label_comment_2
This paper presents the difference of protein populations in nymphs/adults of the Asian citrus
psyllid Diaphorina citri with/without the citrus greening pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter
asiaticus, and the potential interactions between proteins of D. citri, Liberibacter and intracellular
bacterial symbionts of D. citri. I found the result somewhat interesting and worth to be published,
but I believe we need to be careful in interpreting the data of the protein-protein interactions.
This is especially true for the present case where proteins were cross-linked AFTER fractionation
of the homogenized D. citri specimen as described in File S1. This means that the results may not
reflect the true in vivo situation of D. citri. The authors need to describe this limitation, and keep
the description more conservative.
Other concerns are as follows;
Lines 19-20; It would not be appropriate to include ‘microbiota’ into ‘immune system’.
4
Lines 38-100; Overall, the introduction section lacks important introductory information
including that of intracellular symbionts of D. citri (see below). Instead, it appears that the section
is inappropriately dedicated to describe results of the present study.
Lines 41-50; I understand that the situation in the US is the most important for the authors
belonging to the US institutes. However, since the Royal Society Open Science is an international
journal that attracts readers all over the world, it would be more appropriate to describe the
situation of the world, not just the US.
Lines 90-94; The genomic, functional and ecological information of the psyllid symbionts should
be described citing the following papers;
‘The 160-kilobase genome of the bacterial endosymbiont Carsonella.’ Science (2006)
‘Defensive bacteriome symbiont with a drastically reduced genome.’ Curr Biol (2013)
‘Horizontal gene acquisition of Liberibacter plant pathogens from a bacteriome-confined
endosymbiont of their psyllid vector.’ PLoS One (2013)
This is essential to discuss the meaning of the protein-protein interactions mentioned in the
following sections. In the first place, the symbiont proteins mentioned in the present paper are
identified based on the genomic information shown in the above mentioned papers.
Lines 102-108; Rearing conditions including the temperature and lighting should be described.
Without such information, description of developmental time doesn’t make sense.
Lines109-l17; PCR conditions should be described.
Lines 118-125; Although it appears that the experimental procedure is detailed in another paper,
some more information including the starting amount of samples is required here.
Lines 162-181; Regarding Tables 2, S1-S4, I don’t believe simple counting/enumeration of
proteins is fully informative. Graphical presentation of functional categories of differentially
expressed proteins would be more useful.
Lines 247-254; In which compartment (Carsonella/cytoplasm of the bacteriocyte/somewhere
else) do these proteins interact? Is there any structural evidence (e.g. signal peptides) to support
the authors’ hypothesis?
Lines 283-286; Is there any evidence that mucin 5AC localizes in the gut of ACP? If not, it would
be too strong to say ‘suggesting that ~’. The wording should be more conservative.

I found the manuscript much improved, and the newly added data on hemocyanin is interesting.
However, regrettably, it appears that the authors lack sufficient knowledge about the bacterial
symbionts of Diaphorina citri, whereas the paper is dealing with the ‘protein interaction
networks at the host-microbe interface in Diaphorina citri’. For example, the paper shows that
two Carsonella enzymes involved in histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis physically interact
with D. citri proteins. Actually this finding appears very interesting and put more emphasis on,
because the Carsonella strain of D. citri exceptionally retains all the genes required for
synthesizing histidine and tryptophan, whereas Carsonella strains of other psyllid species
partially or completely lack these genes (reference #24).
Lines 110-112; ‘Three bacterial symbionts’ should be ‘Three major bacterial symbionts’. The
words ‘metabolism’ and ‘development’ should be ‘nutritional supplementation’ and
‘reproductive manipulation’, respectively.
Lines 113-116; The citation (#22, the numbering order is incorrect in the first place) is
inappropriate, as it shows only a single case of one aphid (another superfamily) species. If the
authors would like to mention ‘nutritional interactions between hemipteran insects and their
microbial endosymbionts’, an appropriate review (e.g. Genomics and evolution of heritable
bacterial symbionts. Annu Rev Genet. 2008) should be cited. Also, since the material of the
present study is the Asian citrus psyllid, references #24 and 25 should be naturally cited here as
well.
Lines 197-198; The reason for the description ‘significant advances from previous proteomic
studies’ should be described here.
Lines 330-331; For the same reasons mentioned above, the citation is inappropriate. Instead of
#36, a review paper together with the references #24 and 25 should be cited.
Lines 539-544; As mentioned above, the Carsonella strain of D. citri exceptionally retains all the
genes required to synthesize histidine and tryptophan (reference #24). This should be described
here.

eral Comments:
study by Ramsey et al. is a valuable analysis of Asian citrus psyllid <U+FD3E>ACP<U+FD3F> protein expression
ociated with age, symbiont, and Liberibacter infection. The authors identify several proteins that
ract with either the vector, or the pathogen <U+FD3E>CLas<U+FD3F>, and demonstrate upregulation of mucin and
ocyanin may facilitate CLas infection.
conclusions are generally supported by the results; however, there are a number of methodological
stions <U+FD3E>discussed below<U+FD3F> that should be addressed, particularly with regard to information about
ct cultures and the number of samples analyzed. In addition, some of the conclusions were overly
culative given that experiments were not designed to test the observed changes in gene expression
esponse to CLas <U+FD3E>see specifics below<U+FD3F>. Another issue of concern was that the authors disregarded a
at deal of the recent literature concerning ACP biology, symbiont interactions, and protein analysis.
eral recent papers have previously characterized ACP protein expression <U+FD3E>e.g. Lu. et al 2016, El-
sheny et al. 2015<U+FD3F>. ACP transcriptomics, fitness, transmission, and endosymbiont interactions have
n the focus of a significant body of recent literature. Some of these references are provided below.
authors should the address current ACP literature, and also refrain defaulting to comparisons of ACP
h another pathosystem <U+FD3E>Zebra Chip- potato psyllid<U+FD3F> when ACP specific studies are available.
cific comments:
thods: How many insects were used for the study, and how many replicates? Were replicate insects
ained from different host plants? Where did insect colonies originate <U+FD3E>location<U+FD3F> and how long has the
ure been maintained? What were the environmental conditions? Was peptide quantification
ducted on the same individuals that were analyzed by qPCR? If not, what was the infection rate of
CLas+ population?
he requested information has been added to the methods.
ussion: Organization of the discussion could be improved by discussing hemocyanin 1 in a single
ion, rather than interspersing with discussion of hemocyanins 2 and 3. As it stands, this is somewhat
cult to follow. I suggest moving the two paragraphs beginning on l. 350 to follow the paragraph
ing on l. 335.
hese paragraphs have been moved as suggested.
: A more recent reference than <U+FD3E>4<U+FD3F> should be provided.
2016 reference has been substituted for this older reference.
-54: This is an incorrect statement. Several studies have demonstrated transovarial transmission
linski et al. 2010, Mann 2011<U+FD3F>. This is discussed in <U+FD3E>5<U+FD3F> and in <U+FD3E>1<U+FD3F> by Grafton-Cardwell 2013.
his statement has been clarified, stating that low levels of transovarial CLas transmission do occur,
g the Hall et al 2013 reference mentioned by the reviewer [reference(5) in above note].
-67: Some fitness cost to D. citri infection with Las does occur, see Pelz-Stelinski 2015, which is a
re relevant references than <U+FD3E>9<U+FD3F>. Also see Vyas et al. 2015.
eference to fitness in Zebra Chip pathosystem was removed, replaced with Pelz-Stelinski 2015
rence
8: This is interesting. The speculation that increased hemocyanin expression is associated with CLas,
may underlie blue abdominal color, would suggest more CLas infected ACP would appear blue. Is
t true? Did you quantify hemocyanin 1 expression in blue-green vs. yellow-orange-brown individuals?
would be straightforward to do and provide support for anotherwise speculative conclusion.
es we did this experiment and hemocyanin expression is >3 fold higher in blue vs yellow/gray ACP.
data has been added to the paper.
0-291: Change to “were reared”
his change has been made.
verly speculative to suggest that missing immune genes are a general feature of Hemipterans based
32<U+FD3F>. That said, Vyas et al. offers some support for reduced ACP immunity.
his statement has been removed.
0-371: Again, there are more relevant references that should be included. ACP P450 was
racterized by Tiwari et al. Why would these references be omitted in lieu of references to aphid
0?
hile the Tiwari et al paper is a valuable reference, it does not specifically address the function of
6A2, whereas specific function in insecticide and hormone metabolism has been reported for
6A2 in aphids.
8: “stress associated with… and feeding from CLas-infected plants.” This is overly speculative, since
ss due to plant infection was not measured independently from stress associated with CLas
ction. Stress due to plant infection, and associated nutrient deficiency, would possibly differ to a
ponse associated with pathogen infection of the vector. This should be clarified. Poor nutritional
lity should be addressed as an independent factor, to the extent that it can, such as by rearing adults
m all treatments on a CLas-, non-susceptible host.
his has been clarified to remove speculation about whether the insect is responding directly to
s or indirectly to CLas infected plants. We agree that rearing adults on a non-susceptible host may
valuable in future experiments. Current experiments are underway in our lab which are revealing
t the response to CLas by the ACP depends on the plant host environment.

paper presents the difference of protein populations in nymphs/adults of the Asian citrus psyllid
phorina citri with/without the citrus greening pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, and the
ential interactions between proteins of D. citri, Liberibacter and intracellular bacterial symbionts of
itri. I found the result somewhat interesting and worth to be published, but I believe we need to be
eful in interpreting the data of the protein-protein interactions. This is especially true for the present
e where proteins were cross-linked AFTER fractionation of the homogenized D. citri specimen as
cribed in File S1. This means that the results may not reflect the true in vivo situation of D. citri. The
hors need to describe this limitation, and keep the description more conservative.

s 38-100; Overall, the introduction section lacks important introductory information including that
ntracellular symbionts of D. citri <U+FD3E>see below<U+FD3F>. Instead, it appears that the section is inappropriately
icated to describe results of the present study.

s 41-50; I understand that the situation in the US is the most important for the authors belonging to

s 162-181; Regarding Tables 2, S1-S4, I don’t believe simple counting/enumeration of proteins is
y informative. Graphical presentation of functional categories of differentially expressed proteins
uld be more useful.
e agree that there is generally limited value in enumeration of differentially expressed proteins.
wever this admittedly simplistic analysis leads to striking conclusions in Tables 1 and 2 – namely,
t CLas induces a much stronger response in adults than nymphs, and that Profftella and Wolbachia
teins are disproportionately upregulated in adults compared to nymphs while Carsonella proteins
disproportionately upregulated in nymphs compared to adults. Our efforts are focused on using
complementary quantitative proteomics and protein interaction discovery methods to identify a
of proteins for further functional analysis, presented in Table 2.
s 247-254; In which compartment <U+FD3E>Carsonella/cytoplasm of the bacteriocyte/somewhere else<U+FD3F> do
se proteins interact? Is there any structural evidence <U+FD3E>e.g. signal peptides<U+FD3F> to support the authors’
othesis?
he site of these interactions is unknown and none of these proteins are predicted to contain signal
tides. However there are multiple mechanisms of protein secretion in gram negative bacteria, and
n in the absence of signal peptide the Carsonella proteins may be secreted into the cytoplasm of
bacteriocyte enabling interaction with ACP proteins.
s 283-286; Is there any evidence that mucin 5AC localizes in the gut of ACP? If not, it would be too
ng to say ‘suggesting that ~’. The wording should be more conservative.
itation added to a submitted paper from our lab in which proteome analysis of the ACP gut was
formed, and the mucin 5AC protein was found in the gut.

I found the manuscript much improved, and the newly added data on hemocyanin is interesting.
However, regrettably, it appears that the authors lack sufficient knowledge about the bacterial
symbionts of Diaphorina citri, whereas the paper is dealing with the ‘protein interaction networks at the
host-microbe interface in Diaphorina citri’. For example, the paper shows that two Carsonella enzymes
involved in histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis physically interact with D. citri proteins. Actually this
finding appears very interesting and put more emphasis on, because the Carsonella strain of D. citri
exceptionally retains all the genes required for synthesizing histidine and tryptophan, whereas
Carsonella strains of other psyllid species partially or completely lack these genes (reference #24).
Lines 110-112; ‘Three bacterial symbionts’ should be ‘Three major bacterial symbionts’. The words
‘metabolism’ and ‘development’ should be ‘nutritional supplementation’ and ‘reproductive manipulation’,
respectively.
We made this change as suggested, see lines 90-93
Lines 113-116; The citation (#22, the numbering order is incorrect in the first place) is inappropriate, as
it shows only a single case of one aphid (another superfamily) species. If the authors would like to
