The authors conduct a phylogenetic analysis using short fragments of cyt-b, d-loop and zinc
finger (x and y linked) protein gene sequences from 103 noninvasive samples of canids collected
in the western district of Humla in Northwestern Nepal. They attempt to clarify the confusion
that currently exists with the taxonomy and they use their results to propose a taxonomic revision
and designation of the “Himalayan wolf” as a subspecies of special concern. I think that this
paper has important conservation implications but I think it requires major revisions to the
writing and a better description of the methods that were utilized for phylogenetic inference is
required. The authors found a few new haplotypes and recovered some already published
Himalayan wolf haplotypes that were determined to be from an ancient lineage of wolves in
previous published phylogenies. This study confirms those previous findings and the results are
important because they find that this lineage of wolves is also detected in western Nepal with an
extensive sampling. However, I don’t think they can claim that they have discovered evidence of
an “unrecognized wolf clade”. I also suggest that they authors consult and cite a recent
publication by Chetri et al 2016 that also used non-invasive sampling to extend the range of the
ancient Himalayan wolf in Nepal as well (Chetri et. al 2016). This study needs to be incorporated
and the discussion regarding the taxonomy of the Himalayan wolf be placed into better context.
A better description of this subspecies with the appropriate taxonomic citations for the naming of
the species accompanied with a better description of their distribution is needed. I found that the
most important piece of this paper would be the clarification of the taxonomy but it failed
because it was so poorly written and explained.
Also, the phylogenetic analysis and divergence estimation need to be better explained and they
also need to take into consideration recent estimates of divergence that vonHoldt et al (2016)
proposed using whole genome sequencing of various wolf-like canids including Indian wolves
that places the divergence of coyotes from wolves at just 50,000 ybp. The vonHoldt et al estimate
will certainly have an impact in how the authors evaluate the divergence of Himalayan wolves
from other wolf-like canids and this needs to be considered particularly because they use the
coyote to root their D-loop phylogenies. I think this manuscript needs major revisions to the
english text in order to improve clarity.

Review of RSOS-160870
This paper adds data to the earlier findings of Sharma et al. 2004 that the gray wolves in the
Himalaya, east of Kashmir, are a separate lineage from the gray wolves (Canis lupus) and the
Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes). The authors generated mtDNA sequences from one part of
Nepal (Humla region), but only for a subset of the 104 hair or fecal samples they gathered during
their fieldwork. In addition, they generated nuclear gene sequences for the zinc-finger protein for
only 3 and 4 individuals. The remaining sequences were all derived from earlier studies and
found on Genbank. They used the sequences in Bayesian and neighbor joining algorithms to
build phylogenetic trees. The trees are not well analysed or interpreted. They do show patterns
similar to what have been shown in previous work with broader sampling. The zinc finger
results are nearly meaningless given the small sample size and lack of significant variation.
Basically, this paper provides new data from one small region, added to a wider sampling from
previous work, and that does not really add much to the story.
This paper is filled with errors and problems of analysis and interpretation, and is disorganized
and poorly written.
Comments:
Introduction: the authors stated that the paper by Sharma et al. had limited sampling of
Himalayan C. l. chanco, but in fact they had 16 individuals sampled from the Kashmir region,
through Nepal and in Tibet. I am not sure I would call that limited.
Methods:
Lines 94-95: how did the authors generate cytochrome b and d-loop sequences? There are no
methods for this in the main paper, nor a reference citing such methods.
Lines 97-105: this description of other taxa found in the Humla area seems inconsequential to the
analyses and interpretation of these data. Probably best to remove.
Lines 108-109: Would be good to map out the 605 km transect in Figure 1 – not clear if this is
linear from one point to another, or in a grid? This needs to be spelled out in more detail.
Lines 135-137: No maximum likelihood analyses?
4
Lines 145-149: I do not understand the comments about 11 sequences being attributed to dholes,
African wild dogs, etc.? Were they not identified as such on genbank? Or are these sequences
the authors generated and then
Line 148: side-striped jackals (not “stripped”).
Lines 168-172: The trees need to include these previous sequences – i.e., the five haplotypes for d-
loop from Sharma et al. It is difficult to know how the Humla sequences compare to those in
Sharma et al or Aggarwal et al. without doing this.
Lines 173-184: The authors found 11 sequences deposited on Genbank from Qinghai Lake on the
Tibetan plateau. I believe they are saying that they found that some these sequences matched
existing haplotypes from Nepal? Also, they state that other sequences, including some derived
from the Sharma et al paper, are “falsely” attributed to C. lupus chanco/laniger. This makes no
sense – these are synonyms of the subspecies found in the Himalayas, and do fall within the
“Himalayan wolf clade” (while others attributed in the specimen tags and by range to these
subspecies do fall in the “gray wolf-dog clade”. The earlier Sharma and Aggarwal works found
that some of the C. l. chanco/laniger specimens/samples were found in each clade, but that the
dividing line was the Kashmir/Jammu regions. The authors are very confused about previous
work and their lack of genbank designations in their trees (see below) does not help to clear
anything up.
Lines 229-230: what does “one unique haplotype for the ZFY and the ZFY sequence” mean? This
makes no sense. Also, how many individuals does this represent, and how were they related? It
seems to me that 3 (or 4?) is not sufficient to compare to other haplotypes in other taxa given the
one or two bp differences. How do you know these represent the taxon?
Discussion: The authors claim they present genetic evidence of an “unrecognized wolf clade in
the Transhimalayan landscape”. This is not an unrecognized clade, but the same clade as was
found in Sharma et al. and Aggarwal et al. In addition, they state that they confirm the presence
of this Himalayan wolf in western Nepal. Looking at the distribution map in Sharma et al.
suggests that this would have been easy to surmise given the distribution of their samples on
both sides of this region!
Figure 2: these trees need to be redone with branch lengths. Also, the genbank numbers need to
be in the tree, or otherwise attributed to appropriate nodes (in a table?). The d-loop tree is
incorrectly interpreted: the Himalayan wolf clade is not “basal” to the wolf-dog clade in this tree.
It is in the cyt b tree, but there are only two cytb haplotypes in this tree.

I think that the authors have addressed most of my concerns from the previous round of reviews
but I still think that they are overstating their findings. Maybe it is just a matter of rewording the
title as this study was based on non-invasive sampling of canid scats from one locality, Humla
Nepal and they find that the haplotypes that they recovered in their sampling matched
previously published sequences from Himalayan wolves and they go through the effort to clarify
the taxonomic confusion that has prevailed in wolves from this area of the world. The mtDNA
cyt b and D-loop sequences generated here confirmed that wolves from this area were closely
related to the previously published sequences that were demonstrated to be from ancient lineages
of Himalayan wolves. Here, the authors put together all published sequences deposited to date in
GenBank of Himalayan, Indian grey and Gray wolves as well as outgroups (this time
incorporating more outgroups than just the coyote) and also by adding sex chromosome Zinc
finger X and Y intron sequences. I suggest that they clarify the title to better reflect the aim of this
study:
"Phylogenetic evidence based on non-invasive genetic sampling reveals that canid scats from
Humla Nepal are ancient Himalayan wolves: A clarification of their taxonomic status."
I think that the paper is better written and while it now more clearly explains the confusion with
the taxonomy of this species, unfortunately, it still falls short because it does not conclusively
resolve the issue. The paper concludes by stating the following:
"We infer from this and previous studies that the Himalayan wolf lineage deserves at least
taxonomic recognition at subspecies level (i.e. Canis lupus himalayensis). Given further research,
elevation to Canis himalayensis as proposed by (3) may eventually be justified."
While this study advances the current knowledge of the taxonomy of the Himalayan wolf by
attempting to put together locality and other information from previously published
phylogenetic studies studies and unpublished sequences from GenBank, it still leaves room for
9
speculation about the taxonomic status of the Himalayan wolf that was proposed by Aggarwal et
al in 2007.
Also, in addition to referring the reader to pictures of the two wolf pelage colorations, I suggest
that the authors refer to vouchered museum specimens for the proposed taxon. It seems like
several of the specimens that had the Himalayan wolf haplotypes used by Sharma et al 2004 were
from vouchered museum specimens in museum collections and these could be referenced for
taxonomic purposes. Would the taxonomic reevaluation that they propose require a type
specimen? This has important conservation implication because, as the authors have noted, the
lack of taxonomic clarity has stifled the efforts for conservation recognition and listing in IUCN.

The authors have cleaned and beefed up this revision to some extent, but there are many
problems that still exist with the analysis and interpretation. The primary problem is whether
these data really add to the phylogeographic picture that was developed in previous studies, and
my view is that they do not add much. This paper would be better suited as a population level
study (with a reference to how the genetic variation compares to the broader phylogeographic
pattern) rather than a phylogeography study, and as such would be more appropriate for a
mammalogy or more specialized conservation journal.
10
The authors miss the point that the value of some of the previous studies on the Himalayan wolf
is in the geographical breadth of sampling across its putative range. The authors have a single
population sample, admittedly a reasonably large one, based on scat, but only from one small
region of the total range. That is all they add to the other existing data.
The authors also seem to think that only recent “field collected samples” are of value and have
those sampling sites positioned on a map that makes it look like their sample is more important
than it is. Aren’t the museum specimens also “field collected?

speculation about the taxonomic status of the Himalayan wolf that was proposed by Aggarwal et
al in 2007.
Also, in addition to referring the reader to pictures of the two wolf pelage colorations, I suggest
that the authors refer to vouchered museum specimens for the proposed taxon. It seems like
several of the specimens that had the Himalayan wolf haplotypes used by Sharma et al 2004 were
from vouchered museum specimens in museum collections and these could be referenced for
13
taxonomic purposes. Would the taxonomic reevaluation that they propose require a type
specimen? This has important conservation implication because, as the authors have noted, the
lack of taxonomic clarity has stifled the efforts for conservation recognition and listing in IUCN.

Associate Editor's comments :
Comments to the Author:
Both reviewers appreciate the improved clarity of the revised and resubmitted manuscript,
however both identify a significant problem. In the main the issue is that little new insight seems
to stem from the work reported here with regards to the phylogeography of the Himalayan wolf.
Both referees seem to be in agreement that the data and analyses are limited to describing the
population variation of these wolves, and contribute little to resolving the taxonomic issues. One
referee suggests an easy way to help clarify the scope of this research, with a change of title.
Whether the authors can further clarify the scope of the manuscript by additional revisions to the
text should also be considered. The further suggestion of referencing vouchered museum
specimens would seem to be very important in order to aid the main conservation goal.

We are pleased to resubmit an improved manuscript. Below you find the detailed response letter.
Response Letter
We, the authors, first repeat the reviewer’s comment followed by our response to each comment.
Extracts from the manuscript are marked with corresponding line numbers and quoted in quotation
marks (“…”).
Reviewer 1 - Complete general comment
The authors conduct a phylogenetic analysis using short fragments of cyt-b, d-loop and zinc finger (x
and y linked) protein gene sequences from 103 noninvasive samples of canids collected in the western
district of Humla in Northwestern Nepal. They attempt to clarify the confusion that currently exists with
the taxonomy and they use their results to propose a taxonomic revision and designation of the
“Himalayan wolf” as a subspecies of special concern. I think that this paper has important conservation
implications but I think it requires major revisions to the writing and a better description of the methods
that were utilized for phylogenetic inference is required. The authors found a few new haplotypes and
recovered some already published Himalayan wolf haplotypes that were determined to be from an
ancient lineage of wolves in previous published phylogenies. This study confirms those previous findings
and the results are important because they find that this lineage of wolves is also detected in western
Nepal with an extensive sampling. However, I don’t think they can claim that they have discovered
evidence of an “unrecognized wolf clade”. I also suggest that they authors consult and cite a recent
publication by Chetri et al 2016 that also used non-invasive sampling to extend the range of the ancient
Himalayan wolf in Nepal as well (Chetri et. al 2016). This study needs to be incorporated and the
discussion regarding the taxonomy of the Himalayan wolf be placed into better context. A better
description of this subspecies with the appropriate taxonomic citations for the naming of the species
accompanied with a better description of their distribution is needed. I found that the most important
piece of this paper would be the clarification of the taxonomy but it failed because it was so poorly
written and explained.
Also, the phylogenetic analysis and divergence estimation need to be better explained and they also
need to take into consideration recent estimates of divergence that vonHoldt et al (2016) proposed
using whole genome sequencing of various wolf-like canids including Indian wolves that places the
divergence of coyotes from wolves at just 50,000 ybp. The vonHoldt et al estimate will certainly have an
impact in how the authors evaluate the divergence of Himalayan wolves from other wolf-like canids and
this needs to be considered particularly because they use the coyote to root their D-loop phylogenies. I
think this manuscript needs major revisions to the english text in order to improve clarity.
Reviewer 1 - General comments broken down with responses
Reviewer 1 comment: The authors found a few new haplotypes and recovered some already published
Himalayan wolf haplotypes that were determined to be from an ancient lineage of wolves in previous
published phylogenies. This study confirms those previous findings and the results are important
because they find that this lineage of wolves is also detected in western Nepal with an extensive
sampling. However, I don’t think they can claim that they have discovered evidence of an “unrecognized
wolf clade”.
Response: We have improved the phasing throughout the manuscript to clarify that our study adds to
the genetic evidence accumulated in previous studies rather than claiming a discovery. We are aware
and very appreciative of previous studies by Aggarwal et al. (2007) and Sharma et al. (2004) on the
topic. We hope to present the important role of these previous studies much clearer in this revised
version.
See. 110-112: “This study identifies the wolves in the Himalayas of northwestern Nepal as belonging to
the previously discovered Himalayan wolf clade as described through molecular analysis of mtDNA
(2,3).”
See LL. 173-175: “We found that the Himalayan wolf forms a distinct monophyletic clade to the Holarctic
grey wolf, supported by both the D-loop mtDNA and the cytochrome b mtDNA phylogeny (Figure 2.A
and 2.B), similar to the previous studies by (2,3).”
See LL. 308-310: “Our results confirm findings of previous studies from the broader Himalayan region,
largely based on museum specimens and zoo animals (2,3,7,34), which place the Himalayan wolf as a
distinct monophyletic lineage relative to the Holarctic grey wolf.”
See LL. 335-337: “Thus in this context, the current and previous studies suggest the need for adjusting
the taxonomy of the Himalayan wolf in recognition of its genetic uniqueness but also imply the need for
revision of wolf subspecies and units of conservation concern.”
Reviewer 1 comment: I also suggest that they authors consult and cite a recent publication by Chetri et
al 2016 that also used non-invasive sampling to extend the range of the ancient Himalayan wolf in Nepal
as well (Chetri et. al 2016). This study needs to be incorporated and the discussion regarding the
taxonomy of the Himalayan wolf be placed into better context.
Response: We have included the findings by Chetri et al. 2016 in the introduction-
See LL. 51-53: “Recently Chetri et al. (2016) has found support for the presence of the Himalayan wolf
lineage in Nepal with four scat samples collected in the Annapurna Conservation Area and analysed at
the mtDNA control region.”
See LL. 309: Citation of the study Chetri et al. (2016).
Reviewer 1 comment: A better description of the methods that were utilized for phylogenetic inference is
required.
Response: We have included a more detailed description of the methods used for the phylogenetic
inference in the Methods.
See LL. 32-36: “We then compare the genetic profile of the Himalayan wolf lineage found in
northwestern Nepal with canid reference sequences from around the globe with Maximum likelihood and
Bayesian phylogeny building methods to demonstrate that the Himalayan wolf forms a distinct
monophyletic clade supported by posterior probabilities/bootstrap for D-loop of >.92/85 and cytochrome
b >.99/93.”
See LL. 151-158: “Phylogenies were built with Mr Bayes (24) with 11002 tree building iterations (D-
loop: chainlenght: 1100000, subsample frequency: 200, burn-in-length: 110000, samples analysed:
4951; cytochrome b: chainlenght: 1100000, subsample frequency: 200, burn-in-length: 110000,
samples analysed: 4951), and Maximum likelihood phylogenies were built with PAUP* (25) (100
bootstrapping replications). The phylogenies were rooted with Red fox (Vulpes vulpes, Linnaeus, 1758)
sequences collected in the study area (NCBI GenBank accessions to follow). Additional phylogenies built
with Neighbour-joining and Tamura-Nei models of genetic distance showed the same arrangement and
are found in supplementary material Figure S1 and S2.”
See LL. 159-162: “Evolutionary divergence between Himalayan wolf, Holarctic grey wolf, African wolf,
golden jackal, coyote and red fox were calculated with the software MEGA using the maximum
composite likelihood distance between groups of nucleotide sequences (27,28).”
Reviewer 1 comment: A better description of this subspecies with the appropriate taxonomic citations for
the naming of the species accompanied with a better description of their distribution is needed.
Response:
Naming of the species: The name used for this wolf lineage has been inconsistent throughout previous
literature. Therefore we tried to clarify the different names used by different authors, and have done so
at multiple sections of our paper.
See LL. 48-49: “(3) proposed ‘C. himalayensis’ as scientific name for the Himalayan wolf, while (2)
refers to it as ‘C. l. chanco-Himalayan haplotype’.”
See also Table 1.
Description of the distribution: In the discussion we present the current state of knowledge around the
distribution of the Himalayan wolf lineage with reference to all available studies.
See LL. 354-357: “The currently available data indicates that the distribution of the Himalayan wolf
lineage extends west of Kashmir valley (India) across the Himalayan Mountains, with samples from wild
individuals available form Kashmir valley (India) (2), Spiti Valley and Ladakh (India) (2,3), Humla
(Nepal) (this study) and the Annapurna Conservation Area in Mustang (Nepal) (7).”
And see LL. 359-362: “Our analysis suggests that the range of the Himalayan wolf lineage extends north
from the Himalayas across the Tibetan Plateau as far as Qinghai Lakes in Qinghai Province in the
People's Republic of China, while the Mongolian grey wolf (C. l. chanco - if it can be considered as such,
see above) is found in Mongolia.”
Reviewer 1 comment: Also, the phylogenetic analysis and divergence estimation need to be better
explained [...].
Response: We have improved the explanation of the phylogenetic analysis and the evolutionary distance
estimation. We have added Maximum Likelihood analysis, and we have redone the divergence
estimation including more canids to provide a better context for our results.
See Table 2.
See LL. 151-158: See the quotation above.
And see again LL. 159-162: See the quotation above.
Reviewer 1 comment: […]and they also need to take into consideration recent estimates of divergence
that vonHoldt et al (2016) proposed using whole genome sequencing of various wolf-like canids
including Indian wolves that places the divergence of coyotes from wolves at just 50,000 ybp. The
vonHoldt et al estimate will certainly have an impact in how the authors evaluate the divergence of
Himalayan wolves from other wolf-like canids and this needs to be considered particularly because they
use the coyote to root their D-loop phylogenies.
Response: We agree with the reviewer who accurately pointed out that the coyote is not suitable to root
the phylogenies based on the high level of introgression and the resulting uncertain evolutionary history
between the Holarctic grey wolf and coyote Canis latrans as found in the study by vonHoldt et al.
(2016). We have therefore decided to root the D-loop and cytochrome b phylogenies with red fox Vulpes
vulpes.
See Figure 2.A and 2.B.
See LL. 110: We have cited the study by vonHoldt et al. (2016).
Reviewer 1 comment: I think this manuscript needs major revisions to the English text in order to
improve clarity.
Response: We have put care to improve the English text throughout the manuscript.
Reviewer 2 – Complete general comment
This paper adds data to the earlier findings of Sharma et al. 2004 that the gray wolves in the Himalaya,
east of Kashmir, are a separate lineage from the gray wolves (Canis lupus) and the Indian wolf (Canis
lupus pallipes). The authors generated mtDNA sequences from one part of Nepal (Humla region), but
only for a subset of the 104 hair or fecal samples they gathered during their fieldwork. In addition, they
generated nuclear gene sequences for the zinc-finger protein for only 3 and 4 individuals. The remaining
sequences were all derived from earlier studies and found on Genbank. They used the sequences in
Bayesian and neighbor joining algorithms to build phylogenetic trees. The trees are not well analysed or
interpreted. They do show patterns similar to what have been shown in previous work with broader
sampling. The zinc finger results are nearly meaningless given the small sample size and lack of
significant variation.
Basically, this paper provides new data from one small region, added to a wider sampling from previous
work, and that does not really add much to the story.
This paper is filled with errors and problems of analysis and interpretation, and is disorganized and
poorly written.
Reviewer 2 - General comment broken down with responses
Reviewer 2 comment: The authors generated mtDNA sequences from one part of Nepal (Humla region),
but only for a subset of the 104 hair or fecal samples they gathered during their fieldwork.
Response: This was misunderstood by the reviewer, as we have analysed the entire data set of 104
samples for the d-loop analysis, with 72 D-loop mtDNA sequences and 24 cytochrome b mtDNA
sequences generated from our collected field data.
See LL. 146-149: “The dataset analysed consisted of 72 canid D-loop sequences from this study
collected in Nepal and 148 canid D-loop reference sequences from NCBI GenBank. For cytochrome b the
dataset consisted of 24 sequences from this study collected in Nepal and 104 reference sequences from
NCBI GenBank.”
Reviewer 2 comment: The trees are not well analysed or interpreted.
Response: In addition to the Bayesian phylogenies we have also tested and included results from
Maximum likelihood phylogeny building methods. We have improved the presentation of our phylogeny
trees accordingly.
See Figure 2.A and 2.B.
See LL. 154-155: “…and Maximum likelihood phylogenies were built with PAUP* (25) (100 bootstrapping
replications).”
See LL. 144-146: “We constructed phylogenies using Bayesian and Maximum likelihood methods for D-
loop and cytochrome b sequences.”
Reviewer 2 comment: Basically, this paper provides new data from one small region, added to a wider
sampling from previous work, and that does not really add much to the story.
Response: We see the value of our study in that it provides a comparatively larger sample size from a
contemporary living Himalayan wolf population. Further, for the first time we add another piece of
genomic evidence with the sex chromosome linked zinc-finger protein gene analyses, which are two
independent pieces of genomic evidence underlining the mtDNA results of this and previous studies. As
the taxonomic description of this wolf lineage has been pending based on limited data from living
contemporary wolf populations we believe that this study represents a valuable addition to the
literature.
Further we combine and integrate all available genetic data, we generate improved insights into the
distribution range of the Himalayan wolf, and we try to summarize and clarify the inconsistent names
used to refer to this lineage.
Different pieces of genomic evidence
See LL. 112-116: “We confirm the distinction in these wolves with mtDNA d-loop and cytochrome b
sequences and for the first time using also X and Y chromosome sequences, and assess the phylogeny of
this wolf lineage by putting it in context with canid molecular data from around the globe. In addition
this study summarizes the currently available genomic evidence around the Himalayan wolf lineage with
geographic origin to support clarification of its taxonomy.”
See also LL. 175-177: “In addition the results from the zinc-finger protein gene sequences at the Y
chromosome (1176bp) and the X chromosomes (514bp) independently support these findings from the
mtDNA data.”
Improved understanding of the distribution range
See LL. 354-357 and LL. 359-362: Quoted above already.
Name usage clarification
See LL. 226-231: “The understandable confusion around wolf scientific naming in this region is apparent
from sequences on NCBI GenBank coming from wider locations on the Tibetan Plateau attributed
different scientific names, that is sequences attributed to either C. l. chanco or C. l. laniger do cluster
within the Himalayan wolf clade (e.g. C. l. chanco NCBI GenBank accessions: AY333738, AY333739,
AY333740, AY333741, AY333742, JX415343, JX415344, JX415345, JX415347, JX415348, JX415350,
JX415351, JX415352; C. lupus laniger NCBI GenBank accession: KF573616) in this study.“
And also see LL. 48-49: “Aggarwal et al. (2007) proposed ‘C. himalayensis’ as scientific name for the
Himalayan wolf, while Sharma et al. (2004) refers to it as ‘C. l. chanco-Himalayan haplotype’.”
Reviewer 2 comment: This paper is filled with errors and problems of analysis and interpretation, and is
disorganized and poorly written.
Response: We have corrected inconsistencies and carefully tried to improve the overall clarity of the
manuscript.
Reviewer 2 - Specific comments
Reviewer 2 comment: Introduction: the authors stated that the paper by Sharma et al. had limited
sampling of Himalayan C. l. chanco, but in fact they had 16 individuals sampled from the Kashmir
region, through Nepal and in Tibet. I am not sure I would call that limited.
Response: We have deleted the respective sentence in the introduction. (Deleted sentence as found in
previous but not current manuscript: “The work by (3) and (2) included only a limited amount of
material from wild individuals.”). We have tried to clarify that we have complemented previous studies
with a considerable sample size from a living wild Himalayan wolf population. Nevertheless, it is a fact
that the sample size of wild individuals in these previous studies has been low. This become evident
upon careful study of sample origin in these previous studies, but is also described in the technical
report by Habib et al. (2013) (Ecology and Conservation of Himalayan Wolf. Wildlife Institute of India –
Technical Report No. TR – 2013/01, Pp 46). A quote from this technical report by Habib et al. (2013)
where on page 26 their similar conclusion on this low sample size of wild individuals is illustrated:
„However, their [Sharma et al. (2004)] failure to collect samples from the living population of this region
makes it difficult to come to any conclusion. [.....] Both the studies of Aggarwal et al. (2003 and 2007)
and Sharma et al. (2004) have collected samples from the Indian zoos or museum specimen. Srivastav
and Nigam (2009) have recorded the family history of all the wolves of the Himalayas in Indian zoos.
The records mention that only two female wolves were captured from the wild and rest were captive-
bred.“
However please note that we have not included this previous quote by Habib et al. 2013 in the
manuscript but solely use it here to illustrate our response.
Reviewer 2 comment: Methods: Lines 94-95: how did the authors generate cytochrome b and d-loop
sequences? There are no methods for this in the main paper, nor a reference citing such methods.
Response: Please refer to the section Genetics Analysis in the supplementary material where you find
the detailed genetic analysis methods including all references where applicable. To keep the length of
the main manuscript compact we have put this Genetics Analysis section in the supplementary material,
but if preferred the section can be moved to the main paper.
See LL. 140: “All further genetic laboratory protocols can be found in the supplementary material.”
Reviewer 2 comment: Lines 97-105: this description of other taxa found in the Humla area seems
inconsequential to the analyses and interpretation of these data. Probably best to remove.
Response: We agree and we have removed the section. Thank you.
Reviewer 2 comment: Lines 108-109: Would be good to map out the 605 km transect in Figure 1 – not
clear if this is linear from one point to another, or in a grid? This needs to be spelled out in more detail.
Response: We have added the sentence in LL. 128-130: “The majority of transects consisted of
opportunistic searches of the study area, and included also systematic prey distance sampling transects
of two 1.5km transects per 4x4km grids.”
Reviewer 2 comment: Lines 135-137: No maximum likelihood analyses?
Response: We agree that this is needed and therefore we have conducted a Maximum likelihood analysis
for both the D-loop and cytochrome b phylogenies and integrated the results in the figures and text.
See Figure 2.A and 2.B.
Also see LL. 144-146: “We constructed phylogenies using Bayesian and Maximum likelihood methods for
D-loop and cytochrome b sequences.”
And LL.151-155: “Phylogenies were built with Mr Bayes (24) with 11002 tree building iterations (D-loop:
chainlenght: 1100000, subsample frequency: 200, burn-in-length: 110000, samples analysed: 4951;
cytochrome b: chainlenght: 1100000, subsample frequency: 200, burn-in-length: 110000, samples
analysed: 4951), and Maximum likelihood phylogenies were built with PAUP4 (25) (100 bootstrapping
replications).”
See LL. 188-191: “The monophyletic Himalayan wolf clade is supported with posterior
probability/Maximum likelihood bootstrap of >0.92/85 values for D-loop and posterior
probability/Maximum likelihood bootstrap >0.99/93 values for cytochrome b (Figure 2.A and 2.B).”
Reviewer 2 comment: Lines 145-149: I do not understand the comments about 11 sequences being
attributed to dholes, African wild dogs, etc.? Were they not identified as such on genbank? Or are these
sequences the authors generated and then
Response: Yes these sequences are from NCBI GenBank to put the wolf phylogenies in a wider canid
phylogenetic context.
See LL. 146-147: “The dataset analysed consisted of 72 canid D-loop sequences from this study
collected in Nepal and 148 canid D-loop reference sequences from NCBI GenBank.”
See LL. 178-183: “Of these, 62 were wolves (including Holarctic grey wolf C. lupus ssp., African wolf
Canis aureus lupaster and Himalayan wolf C. himalayensis), while the other 14 canid haplotypes of dhole
(Cuon alpinus, Pallas, 1811), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus, Temminck, 1820), coyote, golden jackal
(Canis aureus, Linnaeus, 1758), side-striped jackal (C. adustus, Sundevall, 1847) and red fox were used
to put the collected data in a wider canid phylogenetic context.”
Reviewer 2 comment: Line 148: side-striped jackals (not “stripped”).
Response: Thank you, we have corrected this.
Reviewer 2 comment: Lines 168-172: The trees need to include these previous sequences – i.e., the five
haplotypes for d-loop from Sharma et al. It is difficult to know how the Humla sequences compare to
those in Sharma et al or Aggarwal et al. without doing this.
Response: We have added the accession numbers in both the D-loop phylogeny (Figure 2.A) and the
cytochrome b phylogeny (Figure 2.B). Also all haplotypes used in the analysis with accession numbers,
identical sequences found on NCBI GenBank, and references are found in complete form in
supplementary Table S2 and S3.
See Figure 2.A and 2.B.
See Supplementary material Table S2 and S3.
Reviewer 2 comment: Lines 173-184: The authors found 11 sequences deposited on Genbank from
Qinghai Lake on the Tibetan plateau. I believe they are saying that they found that some these
sequences matched existing haplotypes from Nepal? Also, they state that other sequences, including
some derived from the Sharma et al paper, are “falsely” attributed to C. lupus chanco/laniger. This
makes no sense – these are synonyms of the subspecies found in the Himalayas, and do fall within the
“Himalayan wolf clade” (while others attributed in the specimen tags and by range to these subspecies
do fall in the “gray wolf-dog clade”. The earlier Sharma and Aggarwal works found that some of the C. l.
chanco/laniger specimens/samples were found in each clade, but that the dividing line was the
Kashmir/Jammu regions. The authors are very confused about previous work and their lack of genbank
designations in their trees (see below) does not help to clear anything up.
Response: This is a valuable comment and it points out that we have failed to present findings of
previous studies in relation to our study clearly. So to address this comment we have done multiple
things: We have 1) clarified the usage of names used in previous studies and historically, 2) we have
described the origin of field collected samples from previous studies, and 3) we tried to improve the
presentation of our genetic findings in the context of previous studies and have therefore also included
accession numbers in the phylogenies in Figure 2.A and 2.B. And we have deleted the “likely falsely” in
that sentence.
1) Past name usage clarification
See LL. 48-49: “(3) proposed ‘C. himalayensis’ as scientific name for the Himalayan wolf, while (2)
refers to it as ‘C. l. chanco-Himalayan haplotype’.”
See LL. 68-71: The IUCN [10] recognizes 12 Holarctic grey wolf subspecies with reference to (15), who
historically listed the subspecies C. l. campestris for the northern parts of Central Asia, replaced by C. l.
chanco in southern adjacent regions in Central Asia. These Central Asian subspecies C. l. campestris, C.
l. chanco as well as C. l. desertorum were later pooled with C. l. lupus by (16).
See LL. 226-231: “The understandable confusion around wolf scientific naming in this region is apparent
from sequences on NCBI GenBank coming from wider locations on the Tibetan Plateau attributed
different scientific names, that is sequences attributed to either C. l. chanco or C. l. laniger do cluster
within the Himalayan wolf clade (e.g. C. l. chanco NCBI GenBank accessions: AY333738, AY333739,
AY333740, AY333741, AY333742, JX415343, JX415344, JX415345, JX415347, JX415348, JX415350,
JX415351, JX415352; C. lupus laniger NCBI GenBank accession: KF573616) in this study.“
2) Origin of available field collected samples
See also Figure 1.
See LL. 354-357: “The currently available data indicates that the distribution of the Himalayan wolf
lineage extends west of Kashmir valley (India) across the Himalayan Mountains, with samples from wild
individuals available form Kashmir valley (India) (2), Spiti Valley and Ladakh (India) (2,3), Humla
(Nepal) (this study) and the Annapurna Conservation Area in Mustang (Nepal) (7).”
3) Presentation of genetic findings in context of other studies
See 173-177: “We found that the Himalayan wolf forms a distinct monophyletic clade to the Holarctic
grey wolf, supported by both the D-loop mtDNA and the cytochrome b mtDNA phylogeny (Figure 2.A
and 2.B), similar to the previous studies by (2,3). In addition the results from the zinc-finger protein
gene sequences at the Y chromosome (1176bp) and the X chromosomes (514bp) independently support
these findings from the mtDNA data.”
See LL. 308-310: “Our results confirm findings of previous studies from the broader Himalayan region,
largely based on museum specimens and zoo animals (2,3,7,34), which place the Himalayan wolf as a
distinct monophyletic lineage relative to the Holarctic grey wolf.”
Reviewer 2 comment: Lines 229-230: what does “one unique haplotype for the ZFY and the ZFY
sequence” mean? This makes no sense. Also, how many individuals does this represent, and how were
they related? It seems to me that 3 (or 4?) is not sufficient to compare to other haplotypes in other taxa
given the one or two bp differences. How do you know these represent the taxon?
Response: Even with a small sample size only, we consider the sex chromosome linked zinc-finger
protein gene analysis a relevant piece of genomic evidence in addition to the mtDNA data presented.
Specifically also as sex chromosomes evolve independently from each other and are a slow evolving
area. Fewer haplotypes at this sequence are expected and such a situation is also found in other studies,
such as the study on African (golden) wolf by Koepfli et al. (2015). We do however understand that our
sample size for this analysis is small and have gone back to the lab to analyse all the additional
qualitative samples in the field collected data, which has augmented our sample size for the zinc-finger
final intron sequences to a total of five complete and one partial sequence for the Y-chromosome and to
9 complete sequences for the X-chromosome.
Further we have improved the Figure 4 now presenting both ZFX and ZFY haplotype networks, and we
have added the zinc-finger primer sequences with references in supplementary material Table S4.
See Figure 4.
See supplementary material Table S4.
See LL. 162-170: „For a subset of high-quality samples from the study area in Humla (Nepal), final
intron sequences of the zinc-finger X-chromosomal (ZFX) and Y-chromosomal (ZFY) genes were
generated following the protocols of (5,29–31). For the primer sequences used for the zinc-finger
protein gene analysis see supplementary material Table S4. To test the method and verify our results,
samples of African wolf (32) and Holarctic grey wolf were also sequenced at both these zinc-finger
protein genes. Due to the long PCR fragments involved (>834bp) and inevitable DNA degradation in
non-invasive samples, it was only possible to obtain high quality sequences of the sex genes for a small
subset of the samples: five complete and one partial sequence for the Y-chromosome, and 9 complete
sequences for the X-chromosome.”
See LL. 321-325: „Within the Himalayan wolf population in our study area in Humla (Nepal) we found
one haplotype for each the X- and Y-linked zinc-finger protein gene (ZFX and ZFY) sequences. Fewer
halpotypes are expected at this gene sequence, as the sex chromosomes are a slow evolving area, and a
similar situation was found for the African wolf (Table 3 and 4) (5).“
Reviewer 2 comment: Discussion: The authors claim they present genetic evidence of an “unrecognized
wolf clade in the Transhimalayan landscape”. This is not an unrecognized clade, but the same clade as
was found in Sharma et al. and Aggarwal et al. In addition, they state that they confirm the presence of
this Himalayan wolf in western Nepal. Looking at the distribution map in Sharma et al. suggests that this
would have been easy to surmise given the distribution of their samples on both sides of this region!
Response: We have revised the phrasing to clarify at multiple sections that this study augments the
currently available data on this wolf clade with data from a wild living wolf population and by adding
another genetic piece of evidence with the sex chromosome linked zin-finger protein gene analyses. As
samples from verified field locations are very scarce for the Himalayan wolf, all additional verified field
locations improve the understanding of the Himalayan wolf distribution range. We believe to have
satisfied this comment in response to multiple similar responses above, and do not want to repeat
ourselves to much here again.
See LL. 308-312: “Our results confirm findings of previous studies from the broader Himalayan region,
largely based on museum specimens and zoo animals (2,3,7,34), which place the Himalayan wolf as a
distinct monophyletic lineage relative to the Holarctic grey wolf. This study expands the existing data on
the Himalayan wolf with substantial sampling of a contemporary living wolf population in a previously
unconfirmed location in northwestern Nepal.”
Reviewer 2 comment: Figure 2: these trees need to be redone with branch lengths. Also, the genbank
numbers need to be in the tree, or otherwise attributed to appropriate nodes (in a table?). The d-loop
tree is incorrectly interpreted: the Himalayan wolf clade is not “basal” to the wolf-dog clade in this tree.
It is in the cyt b tree, but there are only two cytb haplotypes in this tree.
Response: We agree with the reviewer about the incorrect description of the positioning of the
Himalayan wolf in the D-loop phylogeny. We apologize for having overlooked this previously. We have
corrected the D-loop phylogeny interpretation at different parts in the manuscript. We have also
included accession numbers and branch length in both the D-loop and cytochrome b phylogenies. Please
also note that all sequence accession numbers as found on NCBI GenBank are listed in complete form in
the supplementary materials Table S1-S3. And we have included a Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic
analyses.
See Figure 2.A and 2.B
See again LL. 173-175: “We found that the Himalayan wolf forms a distinct monophyletic clade to the
Holarctic grey wolf, supported by both the D-loop mtDNA and the cytochrome b mtDNA phylogeny
(Figure 2.A and 2.B), similar to the previous studies by (2,3).”
See LL. 325-332: “The Himalayan wolf emerges as a basal distinct monophyletic wolf lineage to Holarctic
grey wolf in phylogenies derived from cytochrome b. An arrangement which is additionally supported by
the intermediate placement of Himalayan wolf between African Wolf and Holarctic grey wolf at ZFY and
the sharing of a ZFX haplotype with African wolf. At D-loop, the Himalayan wolf forms a distinct
monophyletic clade within the Holarctic grey wolf clade (Figure 2.A., Figure 2.B, Table 3 and Table 4),
but it does not occupy a basal position with respect to the Holarctic grey wolf. Sequencing of longer
fragments of D-loop (currently 242bp) may resolve this conflict.“
Appendix B
Response to Referees
We, the authors, first repeat the reviewer’s comment followed by our response. Extracts from the
manuscript are marked with corresponding line numbers and quoted in quotation marks (“…”).
Associate Editor's comment
Associate Editor’s comment: Both reviewers appreciate the improved clarity of the revised and
esubmitted manuscript, however both identify a significant problem. In the main the issue is that little
new insight seems to stem from the work reported here with regards to the phylogeography of the
Himalayan wolf. Both referees seem to be in agreement that the data and analyses are limited to
describing the population variation of these wolves, and contribute little to resolving the taxonomic
ssues. One referee suggests an easy way to help clarify the scope of this research, with a change of
itle. Whether the authors can further clarify the scope of the manuscript by additional revisions to the
ext should also be considered. The further suggestion of referencing vouchered museum specimens
would seem to be very important in order to aid the main conservation goal.
Response: We greatly appreciate the valuable comments provided by the editor and both reviewers.
We have specified the title to “Phylogenetic evidence for the ancient Himalayan wolf: Towards a
clarification of their taxonomic status based on genetic sampling from western Nepal”. We are further
very appreciative for the input to include referencing to vouchered museum specimens and have done
so in LL. 376-381.
We believe our manuscript is insightful in that it 1) combines the currently known haplotypes of the
Himalayan wolf lineage from different studies into one phylogenetic analysis, 2) adds an additional
new genetic piece of evidence, i.e. the X- and Y-linked zinc-finger protein gene (ZFX and ZFY)
sequences, 3) has led to novel insights around the Himalayan wolf distribution range stretching north
across the Tibetan Plateau beyond the Himalayan mountain range, 4) clarifies past ambiguous naming
applied, and 5) presents the first study with substantial field collected data on the Himalayan wolf.
Resolving a taxonomy is a process including multiple independent studies. We do not intend to claim
o resolve the Himalayan wolf taxonomy conclusively but we believe to be adding an appropriate piece
of research to the process.
n summary this manuscript extents the scientific data available around the Himalayan wolf, presents a
phylogenetic analysis integrating the available genomic data, and provides a timely overview on the
current state of knowledge around this wolf lineage.
Reviewer 2
Reviewer 2 comment: The authors have cleaned and beefed up this revision to some extent, but
here are many problems that still exist with the analysis and interpretation. The primary problem is
whether these data really add to the phylogeographic picture that was developed in previous studies,
and my view is that they do not add much. This paper would be better suited as a population level
study (with a reference to how the genetic variation compares to the broader phylogeographic pattern)
ather than a phylogeography study, and as such would be more appropriate for a mammalogy or
more specialized conservation journal.
Response: We believe to add to the phylogeographic picture around the Himalayan wolf with
additional genetic evidence presented by the X- and Y-linked zinc-finger protein gene (ZFX and ZFY)
sequences, summarizing the available geographic and genetic data of previous studies, clarifying
ambiguous naming of sequences found on NCBI GenBank, updating the knowledge on distribution
ange, and providing field collected sequence data of a current wolf population in northwestern Nepal.
By identifying and integrating all Himalayan wolf sequences found on NCBI GenBank we have
generated updated insights on the distribution range of the Himalayan wolf which spreads north
across the Tibetan Plateau beyond the previously known distribution range across the Himalayan
mountain range. The here generated insights into phylogenetics and distribution range of the
Himalayan wolf substantiates and augments the current state of knowledge of this understudied wolf.
Reviewer 2 comment: The authors miss the point that the value of some of the previous studies on
he Himalayan wolf is in the geographical breadth of sampling across its putative range. The authors
have a single population sample, admittedly a reasonably large one, based on scat, but only from one
small region of the total range. That is all they add to the other existing data.
Response: We appreciate the geographic breadth of sampling of previous studies and hope to
acknowledge this more effectively with a revised Figure 1 which now includes all currently available
ield samples and museum specimens around the Himalayan wolf.
See Figure 1 and its caption on LL. 576-582: “Figure 1. Overview of current genetic evidence of
Himalayan wolf distribution. The data shown originates from the current and previous studies
Himalayan wolf field collected samples: dark green; Himalayan wolf museum specimens: light green).
For overview, samples originating from Holarctic grey wolf lineages found in the larger region are also
shown, i.e. Mongolian grey wolf Canis lupus chanco (dark blue) and Indian grey wolf Canis lupus
pallipes (light blue). The current study generated 72 Himalayan wolf sequences from 104 field
collected samples in Humla, Nepal. The additional data shown derive from the studies by (2,3,7).“
Also see LL. 358-361: “The currently available data indicates that the distribution of the Himalayan
wolf lineage extends west of Kashmir valley (India) across the Himalayan Mountains, with samples
rom wild individuals available form Kashmir valley (India) (2), Spiti Valley and Ladakh (India) (2,3),
Humla (Nepal) (this study) and the Annapurna Conservation Area in Mustang (Nepal) (7).”
Reviewer 2 comment: The authors also seem to think that only recent “field collected samples” are of
value and have those sampling sites positioned on a map that makes it look like their sample is more
mportant than it is. Aren’t the museum specimens also “field collected?
Response: We have addressed this comment with a revised map in Figure 1. Specifically the map
now includes all currently available field samples and museum specimens around the Himalayan wolf.
See Figure 1 and its caption on LL. 576-582.
Reviewer 1
Reviewer 1 comment: I think that the authors have addressed most of my concerns from the previous
ound of reviews but I still think that they are overstating their findings. Maybe it is just a matter of
ewording the title as this study was based on non-invasive sampling of canid scats from one locality,
Humla Nepal and they find that the haplotypes that they recovered in their sampling matched
previously published sequences from Himalayan wolves and they go through the effort to clarify the
axonomic confusion that has prevailed in wolves from this area of the world. The mtDNA cyt b and D-
oop sequences generated here confirmed that wolves from this area were closely related to the
previously published sequences that were demonstrated to be from ancient lineages of Himalayan
wolves. Here, the authors put together all published sequences deposited to date in GenBank of
Himalayan, Indian grey and Gray wolves as well as outgroups (this time incorporating more outgroups
han just the coyote) and also by adding sex chromosome Zinc finger X and Y intron sequences. I
suggest that they clarify the title to better reflect the aim of this study:
Phylogenetic evidence based on non-invasive genetic sampling reveals that canid scats from Humla
Nepal are ancient Himalayan wolves: A clarification of their taxonomic status."
Response: We have revised the title to “Phylogenetic evidence for the ancient Himalayan wolf:
Towards a clarification of their taxonomic status based on genetic sampling from western Nepal”.
To address the comment about overstating our findings please see the improved conclusion. There we
hope to make clear how this study adds to findings of other studies and summarize the next steps
owards full taxonomic clarification.
See LL. 417-419: “Our study adds to the growing evidence around the distinct Himalayan wolf lineage
with substantial field collected genetic data combined with genetic and geographic data from previous
studies and is the first to include evidence from the sex chromosomes.”
And see LL. 401-404: “To test the biological species concept and differential fitness species concept
which are more appropriate for conservation purposes, more nuclear genomic data, including in best
case also functional genes, from across the Himalayan wolf’s range should be analysed.”
And see LL. 421-423: “We infer from this and previous studies that the Himalayan wolf lineage
deserves taxonomic recognition at subspecies level (i.e. Canis lupus himalayensis). Given further
esearch, especially involving nuclear DNA, elevation to Canis himalayensis as proposed by (3) may
be justified.”
Reviewer 1 comment: I think that the paper is better written and while it now more clearly explains
he confusion with the taxonomy of this species, unfortunately, it still falls short because it does not
conclusively resolve the issue. The paper concludes by stating the following: "We infer from this and
previous studies that the Himalayan wolf lineage deserves at least taxonomic recognition at
subspecies level (i.e. Canis lupus himalayensis). Given further research, elevation to Canis
himalayensis as proposed by (3) may eventually be justified." While this study advances the current
knowledge of the taxonomy of the Himalayan wolf by attempting to put together locality and other
nformation from previously published phylogenetic studies and unpublished sequences from
GenBank, it still leaves room for speculation about the taxonomic status of the Himalayan wolf that
was proposed by Aggarwal et al in 2007.
Response: We agree with the reviewer in that we cannot and do not intend to claim to conclusively
esolve the taxonomy of the Himalayan wolf. A taxonomic clarification, especially of canids which is a
axonomic group with more blurred species boundaries compared to other taxonomic groups, is a
process involving multiple independent studies with different pieces of evidence. With this manuscript
we aim to support and advance this taxonomic classification process, while also illustrating which
additional pieces of genetic data are required for such to guide future studies.
Please see LL. 342-347: “Based on its clear phylogenetic distinction and older age of divergence
elative to the Holarctic grey wolf and for consistency within the existing IUCN naming system, the
Himalayan wolf merits at minimum classification at subspecies level of special conservation concern
i.e. Canis lupus himalayensis; and possibly Canis himalayensis as proposed by (3)). Future
assessments of more nuclear data, and critically the factors causing reproductive isolation (if it indeed
exists) may then further validate the taxon’s status as a full species (i.e. Canis himalayensis) (42).“
And see LL. 401-404: “To test the biological species concept and differential fitness species concept
which are more appropriate for conservation purposes, more nuclear genomic data, including in best
case also functional genes, from across the Himalayan wolf’s range should be analysed.”
And also see LL. 422-423: “Given further research, especially involving nuclear DNA, elevation to
Canis himalayensis as proposed by (3) may be justified.”
Reviewer 1 comment: Also, in addition to referring the reader to pictures of the two wolf pelage
colorations, I suggest that the authors refer to vouchered museum specimens for the proposed
axon. It seems like several of the specimens that had the Himalayan wolf haplotypes used by
Sharma et al 2004 were from vouchered museum specimens in museum collections and these could
be referenced for taxonomic purposes. Would the taxonomic reevaluation that they propose require a
ype specimen? This has important conservation implication because, as the authors have noted, the
ack of taxonomic clarity has stifled the efforts for conservation recognition and listing in IUCN.
Response: We are thankful for this very useful comment and have included the voucher specimen
eference for two genetic sequences of which one was referred to originate from a black individual.
See LL. 376-381: “The voucher for the genetic sequence HW9_Museum Nepal (Figure 2.A and 3.A) is
a museum specimen in the Natural History Museum in South Kensington (UK) from the collection by
B. Hodgson from Nepal (NCBI GenBank accession AY333738; BM58.6.24.61) (2). A voucher for the
genetic sequence HW7_Museum Tibet (Figure 2.A and 3.A) is a museum specimen in the Natural
History Museum in South Kensington (UK) collected in Tibet by A. H. Savage-Landor and described
as a black animal (NCBI GenBank accession AY333739; BM99.12.29.1) (2)”
