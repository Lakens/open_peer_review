General comments:
The manuscript entitled "A hollow mesoporous carbon from metal-organic framework for robust
absorbability of ibuprofen drug in water" has been reviewed. The authors presented an
interesting work about the remediation of ibuprofen by adsorption from a metal-organic
framework MIL-53 (Fe). The resulting material was fully characterised using FTIR, XRD, XPS,
BET, SEM and TEM. The adsorption experiments were also applied to kinetic and isotherm
models to determine the mechanism of adsorption. Recyclability of the material was tested and
gave good results. The paper also makes a good contribution to this field of study and presents a
suitable material that can be considered for the removal of ibuprofen. However the paper has
variety of errors which must be corrected before further consideration for acceptance. Here below
are some examples of errors which demand reconsideration:
Specific comments:
1. Some improvements can be made with regard to including instrumentation used, conditions of
analysis and any sample preparations carried out - these should be included in the experimental.
2. The novelity of work should be clarified.
3. The PXRD and FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1. a, b) should be indexed, and Zeta potential of samples
(Fig. 1. d) at different pHs should be presented.
4. In the section “3.3. Recyclability study”, the author said “ibuprofen-MPC complex”, the
description seems vague. I suggest this text should be better replaced with “ibuprofen-loaded
MPC”.
5. In the section “3.2.6. Effect of temperature”, the thermodynamic study was conducted and
Gibbs free energies (<U+2206>G) have been clarified with negative values. Why don’t you conclude that
the adsorption is a spontaneous process?
6. Several statements need more references, for example “Porous carbon coatings may also
increase the surface area and improve functionalized surface chemistry, facilitating the contact
between adsorbents and adsorbates” in the background; “733 cm¬–1 and 550 cm-1 (Fe¬–O) on
the MPC” in FT-IR analysis section, etc.
7. Why don’t the authors study the effect of ibuprofen concentration at higher levels instead of 5–
20 mg/L? Please provide more analysis about the effct of contact time in the section “3.2.4.
Adsorption kinetics”
8. Many English grammar and spelling errors need to be advoided to ensure that the paper flows
and reads well for readers.
Some minor comments:
The authors should also pay attention to the English of the paper to ensure that it flows and reads
well. For example:
Page 3, Line 15, ‘presented’ should be ‘presenting’
Page 4, Line 18. I think your presented application is insufficient and I am not very convinced
about study objectives. I suggest you to exemplify additional interesting applications of nano Fe-
MOF to raise the need for your paper. If possible, give some shortcomings of reviewed papers

and state which will be overcome by your study.
Page 5, Line 44. should be ‘against’
Page 6, Line 28. ‘which’ should be ‘in which’
Page 6, Line 39. Please rewrite this sentence
Page 7, Line 12. Please remove ‘was’
Page 8, Line 44. I suggested to revise the phrase after ‘…proportional to…’
Page 9 Line 24. I suggest to rewrite as ‘…due to competition between cations and active site
seizure of inorganic cations’.
Page 9, Line 29. Should be ‘reduces’
Page 10, Line 28. Should be ‘are protected’. Also, please rewrite the phrase after the comma
Page 10, Line 43. Should be ‘playing’
Page 10, Line 46, Should be ‘in which’ instead of ‘which’

splitting it into two separate sentences.

It this work, a mesoporous carbon from MIL-53(Fe) is synthetized for the elimination of IBU from
water.
Title:
-is it aDsorbability or aBsorbability? May be it need to me modified as the adsorbent is a porous
material.
Introduction:
- "Pharmaceutically bioactive compounds (PBCs) are widely consumed over the world
4
because of their crucial role playing in protecting human’s health from the attack of bacteria
species". Are the PBCs only used to protect from the attack of bacteria species? what about pain?
inflammation? or other diseases?
- The authors mentioned that "With their excellent tailorability and versatile
functionalities, the MOFs are applicable as promising catalysts, adsorbents, drug delivery
systems 20–24." However, in this references there are no articles related with the drug delivery.
They need to complete this information.
- What is the concentration of IBU in wastewater? is it similar to the one used in this study? What
is the pH of this wastewater? Why is important to eliminate IBU from water better than other
pharmaceutic contaminants?
Experimental
-The authors measured the IBU concentration by UV-vis but at which wavelength??
-Is there any work in bibliography were the elimination of IBU in waterwaste is studied? What it
the % of eliminated IBU? For example: “Ultrasonic treatment of water contaminated with
ibuprofen”. Water Research 42 (16): 4243-4248, 2008. or "Synthesis of composite iron nano
adsorbent and removal of ibuprofen drug residue from water" Journal of Molecular Liquids
Volume 219, July 2016, Pages 858-864. Among others.
- MIL-53 is used as a source of Fe, as Fe can be used for the "Chemisorption " of IBU. But, how can
the authors confirm that is a chemisorption? There is a complete characterization of the MIL-53,
and the MPC, but nothing about the IBU loaded MPC. Can the authors add the FTIR, ATG, SEM,
BET, DXRP of the loaded matrix?
- In all the data there are no errors, have the authors checked the reproducibility of these results?
They have to add the error values and the error bars in all the figures.

rnal: Royal Society Open Science
r Prof. Laura Smith,
would like to express our gratitude for the Editor and Reviewer’s efforts to improve the quality
ur manuscript. We believe that our manuscript as a qualified paper in Royal Society Open
nce. We have tried our best to respond to all issues indicated in the review report fully. In the
sed version, we have highlighted the changes to our manuscript using various colors. Here, we
ld like to address the reviewer’s concerns as follows:
iewer #1:
manuscript entitled "A hollow mesoporous carbon from metal-organic framework for robust
orbability of ibuprofen drug in water" has been reviewed. The authors presented an interesting
k about the remediation of ibuprofen by adsorption from a metal-organic framework MIL-53 (Fe).
resulting material was fully characterised using FTIR, XRD, XPS, BET, SEM and TEM. The
orption experiments were also applied to kinetic and isotherm models to determine the
hanism of adsorption. Recyclability of the material was tested and gave good results. The paper
makes a good contribution to this field of study and presents a suitable material that can be
R1
sidered for the removal of ibuprofen. However, the paper has variety of errors which must be
ected before further consideration for acceptance. Here below are some examples of errors
ch demand reconsideration:
cific comments:
ome improvements can be made with regard to including instrumentation used, conditions of
lysis and any sample preparations carried out - these should be included in the experimental.
are very thankful for the reviewer’s evaluation and suggestion to improve the quality of the
uscript. As mentioned, we clarified this instrumentation, conditions of analysis and sample
parations included in the supporting information (SI) document, as follows: “All chemicals
uding ibuprofen, 1,4–benzendicarboxylic acid, iron chloride and potassium chloride were
mercially purchased from Merck. The D8 Advance Bruker powder diffractometer was used to
rd the X–ray powder diffraction (XRD) profiles using Cu–Ka beams as excitation sources. The
00 instrument (Japan) was implemented to capture the scanning electron microscope (SEM)
ges with the magnification of 7000 using an accelerating voltage source (15 kV). The JEOL JEM
0 instrument was used to study the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The characteristics
urface chemistry was investigated by the FT–IR spectra on the Nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer.
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and pore size distribution data were recorded on the
romeritics 2020 volumetric adsorption analyzer system. The UV–Vis spectrophotometer was
d to determine the ibuprofen concentration at 222 nm. The photoelectron spectrometer Kratos
s-Ultra was used to recorded the signals of the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) using a
nochromatic X-ray source of Al Ka and Casa XPS software was utilized to analyze the XPS
ctra. All XPS spectra were calibrated using the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) with a subtraction by Shirley
kground. Gupta and Sen (GS) multiplets was used to fit the high-spin Fe3+ states”.
help the readers follow easily, we inserted these related items in “Section 2. Experimental” (Page
and “section 2.1. Chemicals and instruments” which you can track them with bright green color
ollows:
emicals and instruments for the synthesis and characterization of MIL-53 (Fe) and MPC
erials were described in supplementary information (SI) material. In addition, adsorption kinetic,
herm equations, and mathematical formula were addressed.”
R2
he novelty of work should be clarified.
authors highly appreciate the reviewer’s comment to emerge the novelty of paper. Herein, we
ify the novelty of paper as follows:
<U+F0A7> For the first time, the magnetically and hierarchically mesoporous carbon (MPC) from metal-
organic framework MIL-53 (Fe) was adopted for the treatment of ibuprofen drug.
<U+F0A7> Characterization, kinetic, isotherm, thermodynamic, and recyclability experiments were
systematically studied.
<U+F0A7> Adsorption mechanisms including H-bonding, p–p interaction, metal-oxygen, electrostatic
attraction were rigorously proposed.
<U+F0A7> Compared with several studies, outstanding adsorption capacity (206.5 mg/g), high stability,
and good reusability (up to 5 cycles) were reached using MIL-53 (Fe)-based mesoporous
carbon.
h points mentioned above, therefore, we are pleased to clarify the novelty in the manuscript as
following texts:
he abstract, page 2 (lines 11-12), we added: “effects of contact time, MPC dosage, ionic
ngth, concentration and temperature were systematically investigated”.
he abstract, page 2 (lines 18-20), we added: “Adsorption mechanisms including H-bonding, p–
teraction, metal-oxygen, electrostatic attraction were rigorously proposed”.
he abstract, page 2 (lines 21-24), we modified: “In comparison to several studies, the MPC
ocomposite in this work obtained the outstanding maximum adsorption capacity (206.5 mg/g)
good reusability (5 cycles), thus it can be utilized as a feasible alternative for decontamination
buprofen anti-inflammatory drug from water.”
he introduction, page 4 (line 28-30), we added: “To our best knowledge, this is the first time
the magnetically and hierarchically mesoporous carbon from metal-organic framework MIL-
Fe) was adopted for the treatment of ibuprofen drug.”
R3
he PXRD and FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1. a, b) should be indexed, and Zeta potential of samples
. 1. d) at different pHs should be presented.
highly appreciate the reviewer’s comment to make the figure more obvious. According to the
gestion from reviewer, PXRD and FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1. a, b) have been indexed, and Zeta
ntial of samples (Fig. 1. d) at different pHs has been be presented.
ages 18, we inserted a new version with minor detailed modification as follows:
. 1. The XRD (a), FTIR (b), Raman (c), and pHpzc (d) profiles of MIL-53 (Fe) and MPC materials
the section “3.3. Recyclability study”, the author said “ibuprofen-MPC complex”, the description
ms vague. I suggest this text should be better replaced with “ibuprofen-loaded MPC”.
highly appreciate the reviewer’s comment to make the text more obvious. According to the
gestion from reviewer, the authors have adjusted the text “ibuprofen-MPC complex” into
profen-loaded MPC” under a bright green color in page 13.
R4
the section “3.2.6. Effect of temperature”, the thermodynamic study was conducted and Gibbs
energies (<U+2206>G) have been clarified with negative values. Why don’t you conclude that the
orption is a spontaneous process?
highly appreciate the reviewer’s comment. In section 3.2.6. Effect of temperature, we found that
adsorption of ibuprofen onto MPC was an exothermic (negative <U+2206>H) and spontaneous (negative
bs free energies <U+2206>G) process. According to the suggestion from reviewer, the authors have had
nclusion about this process.
age 12, section 3.2.6, we modified a new text under bright green color for more analysis, as
ows: “The negative values of Gibbs free energy from –50.609 to –53.443 kJ/mol (Table 5)
cated that the adsorption of ibuprofen over MPC was a spontaneous process”.
the other hand, we adjusted the decimal number of energies in Table 5.
age 12, line 35, we also adjusted the decimal number of energies “–50.6 to –53.4”.

highly appreciate the reviewer’s comment to improve the quality of this manuscript. According
he reviewer’s suggestion, we modified more literatures to support the statements “Porous carbon

hy don’t the authors study the effect of ibuprofen concentration at higher levels instead of 5–
mg/L? Please provide more analysis about the effect of contact time in the section “3.2.4.
orption kinetics”
highly appreciate the reviewer’s comment to improve the quality of this manuscript. In this
y, we conducted the experiments by selecting the appropriate range of ibuprofen concentration
m 5–20 mg/L. Performing the adsorption at higher ibuprofen concentration is not referred because
solubility of ibuprofen in water at 25 oC is found at approximately 21 mg/L [1]. Sung et at. also
R6
orted that ibuprofen concentration in their work limited to 21 mg/L due to low solubility of
profen [2]. To obtain the higher concentration, it may be under the use of surfactants such as
yvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) or other methods according to recent
ies [3–5]. However, we solely carried out the experiments in water without surfactants,
efore, it is reported to be 5 – 20 mg/L for ibuprofen concentration.
more analysis about the effect of contact time in the section “3.2.4. Adsorption kinetics”, the
ors modified the new text bright green color.
age 11, a paragraph has been inserted as follows:
e effect of contact time on the adsorption of ibuprofen over MPC was investigated from 0 to
minutes. According to the Fig. 4 (d), the ibuprofen adsorption capacity over MPC rapidly
sted in the first 60 min, but steadily increased for the next 180 min. Finally, the equilibrium
e obtained after 240 minutes. The pattern for this kind of adsorption was totally in line with
eral reports on the sorption of ibuprofen [2,6–8]”.
any English grammar and spelling errors need to be avoided to ensure that the paper flows
reads well for readers.
e minor comments:
authors should also pay attention to the English of the paper to ensure that it flows and reads
. For example:
e 3, Line 15, ‘presented’ should be ‘presenting’
e 4, Line 18. I think your presented application is insufficient and I am not very convinced about

hat is the concentration of IBU in wastewater? is it similar to the one used in this study? What
he pH of this wastewater? Why is important to eliminate IBU from water better than other
rmaceutic contaminants?
authors fully appreciate the reviewer’s detection to improve the quality of paper. For these
cerns, we are pleased to respond according to our best knowledge as follows. For concentration
BU in wastewater, Miege et al. reported a database to quantitatively assess the occurrence and
oval efficiency of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment
cesses (WWTPs) from many scientific publications, which IBP concentrations in the ef<U+FB02>uents
ing several sewage-treatment plants were found to be between 0.17 and 59.2 ug/L [9]. Moreover,
R11
profen concentration reported in effluents in France and Sweden were 7.11, and 85 ug/L,
ectively [10]. The IBU concentration varies and depends on the geographically polluted regions,
contaminated environment (stream, river, etc.). For example, the water column of Lake
ifensee (Switzerland) was mean 1.3 µg/L for ibuprofen [11], while this number in in the Höje
er, Sweden was from 0.12 to 2.2 µg/L [12].
extensively used as non-prescription medicine, with an annual consumption of several hundreds
ons in developed countries. For example, in France, UK, and Spain, it was reported that the
ume of pharmaceutically active compounds sold in different countries was great, for ibuprofen,
ore than 240, 330, and 276 tons only in 2004 [10]. Moreover, excretion rate of ibuprofen is high
to 8%) with an incomplete metabolite, likely leading to the penetration of ibuprofen into soil,
atic media, even human’s food source, therefore, it is important to eliminate IBU from water
er than other pharmaceutic contaminants [10].
his study, we conducted the experiments in the range of ibuprofen concentration from 5–20 mg/L,
ch is so far higher than the fate and occurrence of ibuprofen in geographically polluted regions,
contaminated environment (stream, river, etc.). This concentration range is reported in many
ks. For example, Sung et at. also reported that the adsorption of ibuprofen at the concentration
0 mg/L. However, it is unnecessary to employ at higher such concentration due to low solubility
buprofen (21 mg/L) [2]. To obtain the higher concentration, it may be under the use of surfactants
h as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) or other methods according to
nt studies [3–5]. However, we solely carried out the experiments in water without surfactants,
efore, it is reported to be 5–20 mg/L for ibuprofen concentration.
pH values of ibuprofen-contaminated wastewater can vary in wide range [13]. In this study,
ever, we investigated the effect of pH on the ibuprofen adsorption and to obtain the highest
oval efficiency. Therefore, based on the investigation of adsorption of ibuprofen by MPC, the
eriments need to be performed at the optimal pH condition (at pH 3) to reach the maximum
orption capacity (206.5 mg/g).
h analysis mentioned above, we inserted two passages along with the respective references

the previous studies on the elimination of IBU in wastewater, we agree with the reviewer that
e is a lack of review about previous studies on the elimination of IBU in wastewater. We
efore attempted to refer to two references that the reviewer provided. We also hope that these
uments help the readers found a useful source.
age 3, lines 30–35, we inserted new bibliography in studies on elimination of IBU in wastewater
g with appropriate references under the turquoise color as follows:
r example, Méndez-Arriaga et al. used ultrasonic waves as a means of treatment for the
radation of water contaminated with ibuprofen, obtained the promising results, at 98% within 30
[1]. Meanwhile, Ali et al. reported the green synthesis of a composite nanoscaled-iron as new
eration adsorbent for 92% removal of ibuprofen upon natural water resource conditions (pH 7,
iron dose and agitation time) [6]”
L-53 is used as a source of Fe, as Fe can be used for the "Chemisorption " of IBU. But, how
the authors confirm that is a chemisorption? There is a complete characterization of the MIL-
and the MPC, but nothing about the IBU loaded MPC. Can the authors add the FTIR, ATG,
M, BET, DXRP of the loaded matrix?
authors are very thankful for your comments, and we think that these concerns are very
iguing. Based on our best knowledge, we are pleased to respond as follows:
misorption is characterized by the interaction of chemical groups between adsorbent and
orbate. It is understandable that the more chemical functional groups (acidic, laconic, phenolic,
c groups) exist on the surface of MPC, the better the adsorption of ibuprofen is facilitated to
ur. Therefore, we determined the quality and quantity of functional groups on the surface of MIL-
(Fe) and MPC via Boehm titration. According to Table 1, it is revealed that the number of
ctional groups including total oxygenated (2.2 mmol/g) and basic (0.85 mmol/g) groups for MPC.
ve functional groups may contribute to enhancing the adsorbability of MPC towards ibuprofen.
se results are again supported by the kinetic studies, which the pseudo-second-order model was
nd to be the most suitable, demonstrated by the extremely high coefficient of determination (R2
9994) of the linear plot (Table 2). This model assumes that adsorption of ibuprofen over MPC
be chemisorption via electrostatic attraction between adsorbent and adsorbate [14]. Moreover,
e are many works proved the adsorption of ibuprofen and other drugs onto MOFs-derived MPC
R14
the chemisorption process with the crucial role of functional groups [2,15–18]. Therefore, we
ue that the chemisorption may be a dominance of ibuprofen adsorption in this study.
h analysis menioned above, confirming chemisorption was incorporated into the
nuscript as follows:
age 11, starting from line 25, we inserted new passage with a yellow highlight:
te that chemisorption is characterized by the interaction of chemical groups between adsorbent

nolic, basic groups) exist on the surface of MPC, the better the adsorption of ibuprofen is
litated to occur. In fact, we determined the quality and quantity of functional groups on the
ace of MIL-53 (Fe) and MPC via Boehm titration. According to Table 1, it is revealed that the
ber of functional groups including total oxygenated (2.2 mmol/g) and basic (0.85 mmol/g)

ards ibuprofen. Tung et al. also demonstrated that surface functional groups are a key factor for
orption of ibuprofen [19]. Moreover, there are many works proved the adsorption of ibuprofen
other drugs onto MOFs-derived MPC was the chemisorption process with the crucial role of
ctional groups [2,15–18]. Consequently, we argue that the chemisorption may be a dominance of
profen adsorption in this study.”

reover, to confirm the high stability of MPC materials, the XRD spectra of the pristine and
profen-loaded MPC were used. As can be observed from Fig. 1, the main peak at 44.5o of
profen-loaded MPC still maintained, and existed at the similar position as pristine MPC, proving
the structure of MPC is stable beneath ibuprofen adsorption conditions in aqueous media.
