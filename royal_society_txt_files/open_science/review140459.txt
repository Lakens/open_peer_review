The authors investigate the hypothesis that prime rearing conditions affect the extent of the first
moult, and hence the extent to which birds attain an adult plumage. The question, although
interesting, is not particularly new. Furthermore, the impact of this phenomenon, so-called silver-
spoon effect, on fitness has not been measured in the present study. Anyway, this study has two
drawbacks. 1) It is correlative. 2) The authors considered a very indirect index of rearing
conditions.

This ms reports about positive associations between the extent of post-juvenile moult and quality
of plumage (relative density and carotenoid-based colouration) of feathers in greenfinches. The
sample size is large and the findings are interesting and original, providing novel evidence about
the long-lasting effects of growth conditions on adult phenotype. I have some minor comments
about the presentation of data:
lines 126, 131, 132, 135 – it would be more interesting to see standardized regression coefficients
or measures of effect size (e.g., http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Eta-squared) than just regression
coefficients here. After all, the reader is interested in the magnitude of the effect.
I wonder if the Fig. 1 would look more informative as a scatterplot (i.e., different symbols for
males and females or separate plots for sexes). Currently one cannot see the real data and it
remains unclear how many observations there are by each category.
line 128 – replace ‘carotenoid content’ with ‘carotenoid chroma’, as you did not measure
carotenoid content directly.
line 149 – there is actually more evidence about the long-lasting effects of growth conditions on
adult phenotype (see e.g. Hõrak, P. (1994) Effect of nestling history on adult size and
reproduction in the Great Tit. Ornis Fennica 71, 47-54.) and references therein

Responses to the comments of the Reviewers and Editor:
Reviewer: 1
The authors investigate the hypothesis that prime rearing conditions affect the extent of the first
moult, and hence the extent to which birds attain an adult plumage. The question, although
interesting, is not particularly new. Furthermore, the impact of this phenomenon, so-called silver-
spoon effect, on fitness has not been measured in the present study.
Authors: Following the criticism, we added new results showing that silver spoon effects
mediated by the juvenile plumage quality had fitness-related consequences (positive impact on
first-winter body condition), please see the lines (150-161).
Anyway, this study has two drawbacks.
1) It is correlative.
2) The authors considered a very indirect index of rearing conditions.
Authors: (1) Although we agree that the correlative nature of the study may be considered a
drawback, we think it is worth stressing that studies on long-term silver spoon effects in wild
bird populations are mostly (if not exclusively) correlative. Experimental designs allowing to
show the effects of rearing conditions on fitness-related traits acquired much later in life are very
difficult to conduct in the field, which precludes them from the wide usage by avian ecologists.
However, following the criticism, we now stress more in the paper that the evidence we have is
of correlative nature.
(2) We also agree that the quality/coloration of juvenile feathers is an indirect index of rearing
conditions, but there are at least two arguments in favor of choosing it for the study we
conducted. Firstly, cross-fostering experimental studies on birds indicate that carotenoid
coloration of feathers is mostly environment-dependent, with no or very small genetic
component (please see the lines 49-52). Thus, it is a good indicator of rearing conditions (most
likely of food quality) and possibly a better one that morphology- or physiology-related traits
which often have strong genetic component. Secondly, we hypothesized that birds can modify an
extent of post-juvenile moult in a direct response to the quality of juvenile feathers, whereas
6
direct effects of other nestling traits (e.g. fledgling mass or condition) on moult extent are
unlikely. Although we cannot test for causality with our correlative data, we still think that this is
a novel hypothesis and, as such, it is still worth presenting and discussing, as it may encourage
other researchers to test it experimentally (e.g. in captivity).

sizes.
I wonder if the Fig. 1 would look more informative as a scatterplot (i.e., different symbols for
males and females or separate plots for sexes). Currently one cannot see the real data and it
remains unclear how many observations there are by each category.
Authors: Agree, we changed the graphs to scatterplots according to the suggestion.
line 128 – replace ‘carotenoid content’ with ‘carotenoid chroma’, as you did not measure
carotenoid content directly.
Authors: We changed the terminology according to the suggestion.

adult phenotype (see e.g. Hõrak, P. (1994) Effect of nestling history on adult size and
reproduction in the Great Tit. Ornis Fennica 71, 47-54.) and references therein
Authors: We added the suggested reference and several other references to this sentence (please
see the lines 175-177). We also indicted that long-term silver spoon effects are ‘scarcer’ than short
term-effects (instead of ‘much scarcer’).

Authors: According to the suggestion, we toned down the conclusions, clearly stating in the
discussion that our non-experimental data did not allow to determine whether the observed
relationships are of causal or correlative nature (please see the lines 172-174). We now also refrain
from stating in the title that we have an evidence for the silver spoon effect acting on plumage
quality, as we acknowledge that it could be misunderstood as an experimental evidence (the title
was changed to ‘Silver spoon effects on plumage quality in a passerine bird’). Finally, we added
new results showing that silver spoon effects mediated by the juvenile plumage quality had
fitness-related consequences (positive impact on first-winter body condition), please see the lines
(150-161).

This paper investigates whether conditions experienced as nestling affects the progress of moult
in the greenfinch. This is an interesting topic but I had difficulties to understand the methods.
Please the comments below.
Lines 42 : I would write « whether it may also be determined » becuase the two factors may work
in concert.
Lines 43-44 : I would rephrase this sentence which currently gives the impression that you will
study causal effects, which is not the case.
Lines 45-46 : thus what you are studying is not whether rearing conditions are correlated with
feather quality but rather with moult progress. Thus, the sentence is not entirely correct when
you state « we measured structural quality… ». In fact you measured these quality traits to
recognize new from old feathers (from what I could understand). Therefore, the title is a bit
misleading and I would modify it. Indeed, you imply that accelerating moult is beneficial and
even though it may be true, you did not demonstrate this fact.
Lines 48-50 : about genetics of plumage traits see « Roulin A, Ducrest A-L. 2013. Genetics of
coloration in birds. Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology 24, 594-608 ».
Lines 66-67 : see also « Dreiss AN & Roulin A. 2010. Age-related change in melanin-based
coloration: females that become more female-like and males more male-like with age perform
better in barn owls (Tyto alba). Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 101, 689-704” showing
that the change in plumage traits is correlated with reproductive effort.

Line 86 : If I have well understood you measured feather quality to recognize old from new
feathers. The subtitle should reflect this. Also this fact should be better emphasized because when
I read lines 120-121 I get a bit lost. Are you looking at variation in feather quality or do you use
feather quality to assess the moult progress. Did you demonstrate that your method is reliable ?
Lines 133-134: is this because new feathers are of higher quality or because individuals who
moult faster produce higher quality feathers ? Similar remark for the other results.
Because I cited two of my papers, I sign this review. Hope it helps.

Did you demonstrate that your method is reliable?
Authors: Juvenile and adult-like feathers were distinguished visually by age-specific colouration
patterns, not which our feather measurements, which is now clarified in the methods section
(please see the lines 81-82). We admit that lack of this information in the previous version of the
ms could cause confusion. Structural quality and carotenoid-based colouration of juvenile outer
rectrices (they are usually not moulted during the post-juvenile moult) was then measured to test
whether the quality of juvenile plumage (largely determined by rearing conditions) can affect
ability of birds to undergo extensive post-juvenile moult. What is more, we assessed the extent of
post-juvenile moult in birds which had already finished moulting (please see the lines 77-79), so
this measurement does not give any insight into how fast birds moulted, but how many feather
12
they were able to replace during the moult (there is large between-individual variation in this
trait in greenfinch, some individuals barely replace any feathers and some other may replace
nearly all of them). To sum up, what we showed in the paper is that when birds grow juvenile
feathers of high quality during the nestling phase they are able to replace more feathers during
the first moult (and have more adult-like plumage for the next year), which is consistent with
silver spoon hypothesis. We hope these clarifications will help.
Lines 48-50 : about genetics of plumage traits see « Roulin A, Ducrest A-L. 2013. Genetics of
coloration in birds. Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology 24, 594-608 ». Authors: We thank
the reviewer for bringing this interesting paper to our attention. We now added exact values for
heritability of carotenoid-based feather colouration (h2 < 0.18) to support our statement on the
low genetic control of carotenoid traits and referred to the paper in the text (please see the lines
48-51).
Lines 66-67 : see also « Dreiss AN & Roulin A. 2010. Age-related change in melanin-based
coloration: females that become more female-like and males more male-like with age perform
better in barn owls (Tyto alba). Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 101, 689-704” showing
that the change in plumage traits is correlated with reproductive effort. Authors: We now
referred to the suggested paper in the discussion stating that within-individual changes in
plumage traits have been shown to correlate with reproductive performance in birds (please see
the lines 193-194).
Lines 133-134: is this because new feathers are of higher quality or because individuals who
moult faster produce higher quality feathers ? Similar remark for the other results. Authors: As
we pointed out in our previous responses, we assessed the extent of post-juvenile moult in birds
which had already finished moulting, so this measurement does not give any insight into how
fast birds moulted, but how many feather they were able to replace during the moult.
