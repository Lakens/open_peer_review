The manuscript entitled "Deep eutectic solvent for an expeditious sono-synthesis of novel series
of bis-quinazolin-4-one derivatives as potential anticancer agents " by Arafa, describes a green
protocol for synthesis of bis-quinazolin-4-one derivatives using deep eutectic solvent under
ultrasonic irradiation. The new methodology performs for activating and deactivating starting
substrates. The author describes a hypothetical mechanism presented in Scheme 5 that does not
agree with me. In the first step the benzoxazine is activated by the components of DEES through
the protonation of its carbonyl by tartaric acid. Hydrogen bonding is the main factor that
influences the reactivity and selectivity of the process. The reversible hydrogen bonding between
tartaric acid and carbonyl groups of benzoxazine make substrate–solvent complex activated. The
next condensation of activated carbonyl group with the amine in the DES leads to the formation
of a cationic intermediate with the following loss of a water molecule (Di Gioia et al. Molecules
2018, 23, 1891). Council to the author to completely review the hypothetical mechanism before
publishing it, reporting the correct corrections with the bibliographic reference (Di Gioia et al.
Molecules 2018, 23, 1891). The reference 21 is not relevant to the hypothesised reaction
mechanism.

Arafa report the condensation of diamines with acetanthranil with the main novelty being the use
of a “deep eutectic solvent.” Admittedly, The key condensation reaction between diamines and
acetanthranils has been known since as early as 1911, this work was not cited and should be,
considering not only it's key precedent, but many of the same molecules are prepared in this
work. Please note that the reference below does have the wrong structure for acetanthranils, an
error likely due to the lack of spectroscopic methods from this time (early 1900’s).
Journal of the American Chemical Society (1911), 33, 949-62
This age-old reaction appears to work well in DESs, and they author reports an improved scope.
The authors also report cytotoxicity studies. This reviewer is not qualified to comment on this
data (interpretation or accuracy). I see a table of data, but no "raw" or "supporting" data. Is this
common? This review is unsure.
Address the following before further considering this work:
1. The citation referenced above
2. Syntax. This is a big problem throughout the manuscript.
3. The mechanism – (a) the DES structure seems suspect: the chloride is binding to the
carboxylates only on the tartaric acid. Is this likely the case? Shown is a 9-membered chelate. I
would suspect that tartrate chelates to form smaller rings? Is there evidence to back this structure
up? Is this just a simplication of the DES? (b) an imine with only one long pair is shown having
H-bonds to two protons. This is impossible...(c) L-(+)-Tartaric acid's stereochemistry is omitted.
4. This reviewer does not understand the temperature column in Table 1. (i.e. 50/US) I think it
might be an abbreviation for Ultrasound. Why is this in the termperature column if this is the
case? It is confusing.
5. The SI – There are only 1H NMRs shown? If this is to the journals standard then OK. Include
13C spectra if journal requires this.

6. The SI – The 1H NMR spectra do not have integrations. I also highly recommend including a

RSC Associate Editor:
Comments to the Author:
There appears to be some enthusiasm for this work by the reviewers, however they feel the
authors have missed the mark a bit with regard to presentation and scientific rigor. The authors
should revise their manuscript by carefully considering the comments and concerns raised by the
reviewers, especially those related to the proposed mechanism and biological activity.
In addition to those comments, I have a couple of suggestions:
(1) Table 3 does not add to the discussion as the same information can be found in Figure 3.
Please move Table 3 to the supporting information.
(2) Please add structures to the 1H NMR spectra in the supporting information and add copies of
the 13C NMR spectra.

Comments to the Author:
The reviewers are generally pleased with the changes made to the previous manuscript. One
reviewer has asked that one sentence be modified. I agree with this suggestion, as the results
cannot conclude anything. The authors, however, are able to reach a conclusion. The same
reviewer also appears to be asking for actual IC50 values to be added to Figure 3. I don't think
this is necessary as the current version conveys the comparative data quite nicely and the actual
values are available in the supporting information. There is even a note in the main text directing
the reader to the SI for this information.
I will gladly accept a revised manuscript if the authors simply modify the offending sentence.

p eutectic solvent for an expeditious sono-synthesis of novel series of bis-quinazolin-4-one
vatives as potential anticancer agents
a, W.
al Society Open Science
S-182046
The article describes a study on the synthesis of bis-quinazolin-4-ones using a sonochemical approach
eep eutectic mixtures as solvent/catalyst. Although the reported results can be considered as a good
ribution to the area, the author failed to furnish enough and accurate evidence to support his
ribution. In addition, I recommend a careful English review of the text and I suggest the author to
into consideration the following main points.
1. Page 1, lines 44 and 59 (and others); “utilize” cannot be used as a noun and it must be changed
by “the use” or “the utilization”.
2. Page 1, line 28: what is a benzoheterocycle?
3. The use of DES as solvent/catalyst for the synthesis of heterocycles is the subject of rapidly
expanding literature base and should be exploited more deeply in the Introduction.
4. Taking into account the optimization study described in page 2 and Table 1, I would expect
reactions conducted under ultrasonic irrad. using H2O at high temperatures. Compare entry 8 with
entries 15 & 16: is the reaction temperature an important variable? I strongly recommend the
author to perform a control experiment using H2O at 90oC (or even at 100oC) under US,
in order to verify the actual role of temperature and the deep eutectic mixture on the
reaction efficiency.
5. Please indicate if yields shown in Table 2 are isolated or conversion.
6. Page 4, lines 30,31: not all reactions were quantitative as some described yields are not >99%. In
addition purification by chromatography was not necessary but the products were purified by
recrystallization. The efficiency of the method is over estimated in that sentence.
7. Page 3, lines 51-53: “Owing to the fact that heterocycles bearing halogens are significant building
blocks in the assembly of plentiful of pharmaceuticals and natural products…” this sentence must
be reviewed because its meaning is quite broad.
8. Page 4, lines 37-39: “Finally, the required product was formed through dehydration. From the
proposed mechanism, it obvious concluded that, L-(+)-tartaric acid choline chloride performs a
dual function; solvent and catalyst.” I do not believe this conclusion is obvious. The author has not
provided any mechanistic evidence (despite of any logical suggestions) for the study of the
mechanism of such transformation.
9. Mechanism depicted in Scheme 5 (page 5): I think there is a misrepresentation of the H-bond
activation of benzo[d][1,3]oxazin-4-one (1) by DES. In fact, the N atom in 1 cannot be involved in
two H-bonds, as represented (just one pair of electrons). In addition, several curved arrows are
missing, when nucleophilic attacks were represented.
10. Concerning the MTT test, it is important to mention that this test reveals cytotoxicity profiles, The
“anticancer activity” term used throughout the text must be corrected.
11. The cytotoxicity activity was evaluated in normal cells? It is important to check the selectivity of
the title compounds, using normal cell lines such as HUVEC (endothelial cells), human mammary
epithelial cell (MRF10a), among many others. In this scenario, I was intrigued by the fact that the
most active compound is a nitro-derivative (7e). Once biological active nitro-compounds are
recognized as highly toxic, I speculate if 7e would also exhibit high cytotoxic activity against
normal cell lines. I strongly recommend the author to run in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation
against normal cell lines for the most active compounds.
12. Page 8, lines 52-54: halogen atoms and NO2 group are not “electron deficient groups”. They are
electron withdrawing groups, modifying the electron density of the aromatic ring. Similarly, the
methyl group is not “electron rich”; in fact the electron donating ability of alkyl groups is
somewhat limited. I suggest this argumentation should be entirely reviewed.
13. Finally, in the Conclusion section, the author overestimated the “potential anticancer activity” of
the studied compounds in the article. Once again, the in vitro evaluation of cytotoxic activity is
only the first step in the development of an anticancer drug. I think it is not appropriate to use
“anticancer activity” (in vivo) as synonym for “cytotoxic activity” (in vitro).
