This manuscript propose a promising method for classifying heavy metals in aqueous solution
using Mie scattering measurements associated with each ion’s characteristic activity with
different sizes of microparticles linked with metal ions. This study mainly was aimed to probe
how well statistical inference methods could classify the heavy metal ion species in the water
samples using non-specific assays. This study is interesting for identify heavy metal ions in
water. However, some problems need to be resolved or addressed appropriately before
publication.
(1) Fig. 1 needs to be explained in more detail. For example, How can we obtain the dotted plot in
the left of Fig. 1? and how to distinguish whether the microparticles is aggregated.
(2) It is suggested that the authors may explain why select K+ and Mg2+ as the control cations.
(3) In this study, the mixed species solutions just contain two metals. However, there are many
heavy metals generally coexisting in natural water. Does the method proposed in this study work
for the complex aqueous solution?
(4) It is better to provide field application examples to strengthen the feasibility and reliability of
the technique proposed in this study.

At this moment the paper shows limitations related to sensitivity/specificity in the assays, but
they demonstrated the valuation of a methodology that can be improved through the generation
and analysis of a bigger set of data. Finally, including more variables in the assays, maybe they
could fill the requirements of EPA for complex samples, like environmental samples of
contaminated water. This is a paper that the journal Royal Society Open Science can publish.

RESPONSE LETTER
Title: Mie scattering and microparticle based characterization of heavy metal ions
and classification by statistical inference methods
Manuscript ID: RSOS-190001
Dear Editor and Reviewers,
We appreciate the constructive feedback and evaluation of our manuscript. In the
following text below, we address the reviewers’ points of concern.
REVIEWER 1
Comment: This manuscript propose a promising method for classifying heavy metals
in aqueous solution using Mie scattering measurements associated with each ion’s
characteristic activity with different sizes of microparticles linked with metal ions.
This study mainly was aimed to probe how well statistical inference methods could
classify the heavy metal ion species in the water samples using non-specific assays.
This study is interesting for identify heavy metal ions in water. However, some
problems need to be resolved or addressed appropriately before publication.
Comment 1: Fig. 1 needs to be explained in more detail. For example, how can we
obtain the dotted plot in the left of Fig. 1? And how to distinguish whether the
microparticles is aggregated.
Response: I believe the reviewer is referring the “dotted plot” in the left of Fig. 1 as
the series of holes in the 3D printed device. A detection optical fiber is inserted into
one of these holes to collect scattering intensity at a specific angle. The angle
showing the maximum scatter intensity shifts to a different angle upon particle
aggregation, which is used for identifying heavy metal ions. The “dotted plots” on
the right of Fig. 1 are images of the single and aggregated particles: the upper
images were modified from grayscale to binary to identify particles, and the lower
are false color images in which single particles (0.91 µm in diameter) are
distinguished from aggregated particles.
Figure 1 caption is modified: “Fig. 1. (left) Mie scattering intensity is collected at a
specific detection angle through inserting a detection optical fiber into one of the
holes in the 3D printed device. The angle showing the maximum Mie scatter
intensity shifts to a different angle upon particle aggregation, which can be used for
identifying heavy metal ions. (right) Carboxylated polystyrene microparticles
characteristically interact with heavy metal ions (Me2+). This leads to particle
aggregation, e.g. effective particle size changes from singlets (green) to aggregates
(red), shown via microscopy with 0.91 µm particles in the presence of 1 and 10 ppb
Cr(VI).”
Comment 2: It is suggested that the authors may explain why select K+ and Mg2+ as
the control cations.
Response: They are control cations – K+ was chosen from group 1 and Mg2+ from
group 2 in the periodic table, considering their atomic mass and environmental
availability. As we are not quantifying those cations and simply using them as
controls, we have chosen one cation from each group.
Added to section 2.4: “… Assay samples containing single heavy metal species or
single reference cation species (K+ or Mg2+; chosen from groups 1 and 2 from the
periodic table considering their atomic mass and environmental availability) were
prepared separately with each PS-COOH sample (D = 0.91 µm, 0.75 µm, and 0.40
µm) in a 50:50 ratio. …”
Comment 3: In this study, the mixed species solutions just contain two metals.
However, there are many heavy metals generally coexisting in natural water. Does
the method proposed in this study work for the complex aqueous solution?
Response: As addressed at the end of Introduction, single species
identification/quantification was the main aim of this work, while we have also
demonstrated preliminary assays of binary heavy metal mixtures. In fact, binary
mixtures of heavy metals are predominantly found in groundwater or drinking water
contamination scenarios. In pipe leaching into drinking water case, Pb(II) and Cu(II)
were the two major heavy metal ions as reported by references 13 and 14. In
subsurface water contamination in mine tailings, Cd(II) and Ni(II) were the two
major heavy metal ions as reported by references 16 and 17. Other examples of
such water contamination by binary heavy metal ions are added in this revision.
Added to the end of section 3.4: “To better identify multiple heavy metal ion species
found in environmental water samples, it may be necessary to expand this method
to mixtures of more than three heavy metal ion species. However, the amount of
data that would need to be collected to develop such a multiplexed model would be
extraordinarily high, requiring extensive labor and resources. For most groundwater
and drinking water samples, however, as few as one or two major heavy metal ion
species are often observed, as we have simulated in this study (Pb(II) and Cu(II) in
pipe leaching and Cd(II) and Ni(II) in subsurface mine tailing models). This is true for
other types of groundwater or drinking water samples. Taghipour et al.32 reported
the heavy metal contamination of groundwater used for irrigation in Tabriz, Iran,
and found that the average Zn(II) and Cu(II) concentrations were 49 ppb (maximum
204 ppb) and 16 ppb (maximum 37 ppb), respectively, while all other heavy metal
ion concentrations were < 6.6 ppb (average was 3.8 ppb). Rahmanian et al.33
reported on drinking water contamination in Perak, Malaysia, and found that the
average Mg and Fe concentrations were 119-512 ppb and 12-67 ppb, respectively,
while all other heavy metal ion concentrations were < 7 ppb (< 2 ppb for 78% of
data).”

Comment 4: It is better to provide field application examples to strengthen the
feasibility and reliability of the technique proposed in this study.
Response: We recognize that there are inherent physical limitations to the
sensitivity/specificity of the carboxylated particle aggregation assay of heavy metal
ions. However, the main point of the paper was an exploration of how well
statistical inference methods could classify heavy metal ion species in the water
samples using non-specific assays. These methods work better with larger datasets,
so there are limitations to this paper in that regard. However, we aimed to show in
this work that reasonable detection could be achieved under a set of controlled
circumstances even with a relatively limited amount of data (given the number of
total ions and combinations we evaluated).
The system proposed in the paper could be applicable in real water systems if an
extensive dataset encompassing the aggregation of the PS-COOH particles and
heavy metal ions in an environment with other chemical species was recorded
through statistical classification methods outlined in the paper. Thus, it is not our
primary focus for this paper to explore the effects of other chemical species when
the paper’s purpose is to show how polystyrene particle aggregation, Mie scattering
measurements, and statistical classification can be used to make a sensitive and
specific environmental sensor.
To adapt this method for more complicated field water samples, e.g. river water, a
huge amount of data would need to be collected with all possible combinations of
heavy metal ion species and their concentrations. Such effort would require a large-
scale, multi-institutional collaboration, which we hope to garner through this work.
REVIEWER 2
Comments. This paper offers the possibility to simplify heavy metal analysis in
environmental samples. It has been developed a way to classify heavy metal species
in water samples using non-specific assays. At this moment the paper shows
limitations related to sensitivity/specificity in the assays, but they demonstrated the
valuation of a methodology that can be improved through the generation and
analysis of a bigger set of data. Finally, including more variables in the assays,
maybe they could fill the requirements of EPA for complex samples, like
environmental samples of contaminated water. This is a paper that the journal Royal
Society Open Science can publish.
Response: Thank you very much for the positive comments. Please refer to our
responses to the reviewer 1 regarding the current limitations and potential
applications to complex samples.
