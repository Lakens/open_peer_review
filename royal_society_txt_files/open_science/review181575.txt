This is a sound replication of previous research by Van Lange et al. (1997) on social value
orientation and adult attachment. I have two minor suggestions that I think would help improve
the paper. First, the authors seem to be implying that the large number of citations that the
original article received is a marker of the paper's influence. But my sense, from examining some
of the articles that have cited the original is that those citations are not for the attachment-SVO
findings/claims, but rather simply a citation for the SVO idea itself and some of the methods that
were used to study it. I think it is potentially misleading to imply that the attachment-SVO
findings have been influential in the field.
Second, on page 5, I would caution against suggesting that adult attachment patterns are a
function of "early" experience. The statement implicitly suggests that later experiences are not
relevant. I doubt the authors believe that, but that is one way to interpret the use of the term
"early" rather than, say, "prior" or "a history of interpersonal experiences."
I think the methods and analytic strategies are sound. I'm glad the sample size is relatively large.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Chris Chambers):
Two expert reviewers have now appraised the manuscript. As you will see, both are positive
about the submission but note several areas requiring attention. The most substantial concern
(Reviewer #1) is the need for greater detail about the analyses and certain aspects of the
instruments. In addition to this major issue, both reviewers offer a range of constructive
suggestions for clarifying and justifying specific arguments.

I have one minor and one major point that I would like the authors to adress before I can
recommend the manuscript for publication.
Minor
The authors should explicate the number of individuals that could not be classified. Also there is
currently no description of the criterion/cutoff used for the classification.
Major
Following my request from the first stage review, the authors have added a footnote on the
availability of better SVO measures. However, I do not think that this should be put in a footnote,
it deserves to be part of the main body of the discussion. First, the very philosophy of the authors
(which I endorse!) is that replication should make use of the development of better measures. To
be consistent with this thinking, the authors should not only stress to what extent their paper
meets this standard but also point to their failures of meeting it (although it was clearly not a
fault as new SVO instruments were freshly developed when data collection commenced). This
does not weaken the paper but instead makes it more consistent and convincing. Second, the
authors' argument that their SVO scale was highly consistent based on KR20 is at least difficult.
On the one hand, this statistic rests on an artifical dichotomization of paricipants' answers. On the
other hand, it is not surprising to get a high KR20s given that the triple dominance scales
essentially confront participants with three highly similar choices (Murphy & Ackermann, 2014,
PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV). Third (and related), the very point about newly developed SVO
scales (e.g., Murphy, Ackermann, & Handgraaf, 2011, JUDGM DECIS MAK) is the insight that
gradual differences in SVO can matter much more than nominal classifications - classifications
can even conceal meaningful differences due to SVO (for illustrations of this important point, see
Bieleke, Gollwitzer, Oettingen, & Fischbacher, 2017, J BEHAV DECIS MAKING; Fiedler,
Glöckner, Nicklisch, & Dickert, 2013, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC). To me, this insight seems at
least as important as the new developments regarding attachment scales stressed in the present
paper. Adressing this point more thoroughly would make the paper a much more useful
contribution for researchers who care about SVO. Moreover, it provides a promising avenue for
7
future research - which, for instance, might examine whether gradual SVO differences relate
more robustly to attachment.

I believe the authors have done an excellent job at analyzing the data and providing a fair and
rigorous test of the key idea (i.e., that there is an association between attachment security and
SVO).
I also believe the authors have summarized their findings well, discussed them in valuable ways,
and have been appropriately cautionary about what has and has not been learned from this
research.
In short, I think this manuscript is ready to be published.

authors describe four waves of data collection aiming at a replication of van Lange et
s (1997; Studies 1 and 2) finding that social value orientation (SVO) is associated with
t attachment style. It is a Stage 1 replication study with the blinded results of an
ady completed data collection. I find this research timely and interesting, although I
some remarks that I would like the authors to address. Below are my thoughts and remarks
rding the different reviewer questions.
tage 1 Primary Criterion #1: Whether the authors provide a sufficiently clear and
iled description of the methods for another researcher to closely replicate the proposed
rimental procedures and analysis pipeline, and to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the
rimental procedures or analysis pipeline.
e authors report the measures included in all four waves of data collection. They should
explicit whether they used the exact same triple-dominance scale as van Lange et al. to
ure SVO. This seems to be the case but it should be explicit and the resulting effective
er of participants (including non-classifiable participants) should be mentioned.
e authors want to make their data and analysis syntax publicly available. However, I
ot check this because the link has been redacted for review.
garding the analysis pipeline, the central piece of information is missing: How will the
ciation between SVO and attachment style be tested? Will the authors use the same
oach as van Lange et al. (e.g., MANOVA, controlling for gender) or a different one?
larly, will SVO be determined in the same way as by van Lange et al. (e.g., removing not
sifiable participants)? If not, what is changed and why?
tage 1 Primary Criterion #2: Whether the manuscript describes a sufficiently valid (i.e.
e) and robust (e.g. statistically powerful) replication of the original study methods
rationale to provide an indication of replicability.
e described experiment closely replicates van Lange et al., except from different
ures of attachment. According to the authors, these measures are psychometrically more
d (i.e., reliable, valid) than those used by van Lange et al.
e authors convincingly describe that van Lange et al. used a poor measure of attachment,
h might have produced spurious associations with SVO. This clearly indicates the need
a replication study.
e original study already rested on a large sample and the authors' sample even exceeds
number. The sensitivity analysis is convincing and the required analyses should be
iciently powered.
tage 1 Secondary Criterion #1: The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed
theses.
is not clear whether the authors expect van Lange et al.'s study to replicate or not.
herwise, the authors' assumptions seem plausible to me.
tage 1 Secondary Criterion #2: The soundness of the methodology and analysis pipeline.
have one major issue with this research: While the authors focus on better measures of
chment, they seem to have missed crucial developments regarding the assessment of SVO
Murphy, Ackermann, & Handgraaf, 2011; Murphy & Ackermann, 2013). The scale used by van
e et al. has meanwhile been shown to be clearly dominated by continuous SVO scales, and
use of nominal categories is commonly discouraged for theoretical reasons (e.g.,
ler, Glöckner, Nicklisch, & Dickert, 2013). This said, I want to stress that I like the
ors' attempt to test whether an important empirical finding still holds when improved
ures are used, rather than literally repeating the same experiment. However, this
oach would have required to measure SVO in a modern and empirically sound way as well.
aspect reduces my enthusiasm about the described experiment. Since the experiment has
ady been conducted, the authors should at least address this limitation later in the
ussion of their manuscript.
re-iterate, I feel that the analysis pipeline is not described in sufficient detail to
rmine whether or not it is sound.
-1-
Sunday, October 28, 2018 5:11 PM
tage 1 Secondary Criterion #3: Whether the authors have considered sufficient
ome-neutral conditions (e.g. absence of floor or ceiling effects; positive controls;
r quality checks) for ensuring that the results obtained are able to test the stated
theses.
would have desirable to have van Lange et al.'s original instruments in these
riments as well. This way, the authors could have tested whether differences in the
ings reflect differences in the applied measures or result from other differences in the
rimental protocol.
herwise, the authors' approach seems sound to me.

Appendix B
Dear Dr. Chambers,
We would like to thank you for your and the reviewers’ thorough attention to
our work. Below we respond to the reviewers’ concerns one-by-one. To
facilitate review, we submit a version with track changes on and one with track
changes accepted.
Reviewer 1: * The authors report the measures included in all four waves of
data collection. They should make explicit whether they used the exact same
triple-dominance scale as van Lange et al. to measure SVO. This seems to be
the case but it should be explicit and the resulting effective number of
participants (including non-classifiable participants) should be mentioned.
Authors’ Reply: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have
changed a sentence in the procedure to clarify this point: “In each year SVO
was assessed by the same nine-item triple dominance measure used in the
original (Messick & McClintock, 1968; see also Van Lange et al., 1997).”
Reviewer 1: The authors want to make their data and analysis syntax publicly
available. However, I cannot check this because the link has been redacted for
review.
Authors’ Reply: We apologize for this. Because our results were already
posted with our syntax, we could not link to our page. To facilitate further
review, I link to the analysis scripts in this letter from my dropbox:

Reviewer 1: Regarding the analysis pipeline, the central piece of information
is missing: How will the association between SVO and attachment style be
tested? Will the authors use the same approach as van Lange et al. (e.g.,
MANOVA, controlling for gender) or a different one? Similarly, will SVO be
determined in the same way as by van Lange et al. (e.g., removing not
classifiable participants)? If not, what is changed and why?
Authors’ Reply: If participants could not be classified, we also planned to
remove them. For our final analyses, we indeed had planned to analyse the
data both with and without sex as covariate (giving the original report the
maximum chance to replicate). The main analyses were planned by contrasting
prosocials with proselfs, as these were the main analyses in the original paper.
We had also planned to run a number of auxiliary analyses to check the
robustness of our results:
- run analyses with interaction year as predictor, to ensure that studies do not
vary per year (as we also had some different measures throughout).
- we planned to run all analyses within each year.
Reviewer 1: * The described experiment closely replicates van Lange et al.,
except from different measures of attachment. According to the authors, these
measures are psychometrically more sound (i.e., reliable, valid) than those
used by van Lange et al.
* The authors convincingly describe that van Lange et al. used a poor measure
of attachment, which might have produced spurious associations with SVO.
This clearly indicates the need for a replication study.
* The original study already rested on a large sample and the authors' sample
even exceeds this number. The sensitivity analysis is convincing and the
required analyses should be sufficiently powered.
Authors’ Reply: We thank the reviewer for her/his positive words.
Reviewer 1: * It is not clear whether the authors expect van Lange et al.'s
study to replicate or not.
* Otherwise, the authors' assumptions seem plausible to me.
Authors’ Reply: We don’t think that, for the replication, it is relevant whether
we had expected the result to replicate or not. We initially thought that the
hypothesis was relatively reasonable, but that perhaps the relationship between
SVO and attachment is slightly more contexualized (e.g., perhaps securely
attached individuals are prosocial in an environment that is friendly and not
harsh, and are not prosocial in a harsh environment). However, because of the
methods used in the original paper, we became increasingly more sceptical of
the results.
Reviewer 1: * I have one major issue with this research: While the authors
focus on better measures of attachment, they seem to have missed crucial
developments regarding the assessment of SVO (see Murphy, Ackermann, &
Handgraaf, 2011; Murphy & Ackermann, 2013). The scale used by van Lange
et al. has meanwhile been shown to be clearly dominated by continuous SVO
scales, and the use of nominal categories is commonly discouraged for
theoretical reasons (e.g., Fiedler, Glöckner, Nicklisch, & Dickert, 2013). This
said, I want to stress that I like the authors' attempt to test whether an
important empirical finding still holds when improved measures are used,
rather than literally repeating the same experiment. However, this approach
would have required to measure SVO in a modern and empirically sound way
as well. This aspect reduces my enthusiasm about the described experiment.
Since the experiment has already been conducted, the authors should at least
address this limitation later in the discussion of their manuscript.
Authors’ Reply: We understand the reviewer’s concern and our attempt is
partly constrained by the data we had available (after all, we also started the
data collection for this project in 2011 and ended in 2014; for the 2014, we
could have adjusted the measure). We would like to point that, unlike many
other SVO papers, we do calculate a Kuder-Richardson 20 coefficient for its
reliability. If this coefficient is sufficient, we can be sufficiently confident that
the measure does what it is supposed to do. We do agree that we will have to
discuss the superiority of the new measure in the discussion.
Reviewer 1: * To re-iterate, I feel that the analysis pipeline is not described
in sufficient detail to determine whether or not it is sound.
Authors’ Reply: We hope that with the links to the syntaxes and the extra
explanation this is sufficiently detailed.
Reviewer 1: * It would have desirable to have van Lange et al.'s original
instruments in these experiments as well. This way, the authors could have
tested whether differences in the
findings reflect differences in the applied measures or result from other
differences in the experimental protocol.
Authors’ Reply: We understand this preference, but suspect that this may
have been overkill. After all, it seems that the original results were obtained by
controlling for gender and dropping a few items. Given also the limited
evidential value of the original article, the effect was likely noise.
Reviewer 2: This is a sound replication of previous research by Van Lange et
al. (1997) on social value orientation and adult attachment. I have two minor
suggestions that I think would help improve the paper. First, the authors seem
to be implying that the large number of citations that the original article
received is a marker of the paper's influence. But my sense, from examining
some of the articles that have cited the original is that those citations are not
for the attachment-SVO findings/claims, but rather simply a citation for the
SVO idea itself and some of the methods that were used to study it. I think it is
potentially misleading to imply that the attachment-SVO findings have been
influential in the field.
Authors’ Reply: We thank the reviewer for this comment, but respectfully
disagree, for two reasons. First of all, the link with attachment provides the
SVO measure with a proof-of-concept and if this proof-of-concept does not
hold up, it potentially presents a problem for the measure. This impression is
further confirmed by Van Lange et al.’s preference for conceptually replicating
the effect. Furthermore, we looked at some of the most highly cited papers
citing this paper (including Van Lange himself) and this further confirmed our
idea:
- “Research regarding attachment processes also illuminates our
understanding of dependence situations, in that issues of dependence
and security are at the heart of attachment concerns. The adult
attachment literature suggests that the intrapersonal and interpersonal
adaptations acquired in childhood are carried into adult interactions.”
(Rusbult & Van Lange, 2003)
- “As demonstrated in several studies, commitment is predictive of
various cognitions and behaviors, including not only accommodation
but also willingness to sacrifice, unrealistically positive beliefs about
the relationship, and a shift in thinking from “I, me, and mine” to “we,
us, and ours ” (e.g., Agnew et al., 1998; Rusbult, Van Lange,
Wildschut, Yovetich, & Verette, 2000; Van Lange, Otten, De Bruin, &
Joireman, 1997; Van Lange, Rusbult, et al., 1997; Wieselquist,
Rusbult, Foster, & Agnew, 1999).” (from Karremans, Van Lange,
Ouwerkerk, Kluwer, 2003).
- “Another line of research suggests that SVO might be related to
perceived closeness because of its relationship with attachment styles
(Van Lange, De Bruin, Otten, & Joireman, 1997)” (from Cornellisen et
al., 2011).
- “‘Cooperation’ in this literature is broadly defined and encompasses
the contribution of points (e.g. De Cremer and van Vugt, 1999) or time
(e.g. McClintock and Allison, 1989) in social dilemmas, pro-
environmental behaviour (e.g. van Vugt et al., 1995), a friendly and
cooperative negotiation style (e.g. De Dreu and van Lange, 1995;
Nauta et al., 2002), and identification in close relations (e.g. van Lange
et al., 1997a)” (from Bogaert et al., 2012).
- “Adults who are higher in attachment-related anxiety are less skilled at
decoding nonverbal messages (Feeney, Noller, & Callan, 1994),
display less "topical" reciprocity (a sign of responsive listening) in
response to another's self-disclosure (Mikulincer & Nachshon, 1991),
and are less likely to hold a prosocial interpersonal orientation (Van
Lange, Otten, De Bruin, & Joireman, 1997)” (from Collins & Feeney,
2000).
- “Some of the confusion about the difference between people’s personal
value systems and their perceptions of others’ value priorities—
people’s social value systems—stems from the tendency to discuss
people’s stable tendencies to deal with others in their social
environments in particular ways as social values (e.g., Beggan &
Allison, 1994; Liebrand & Dehue, 1996; McClintock, 1978; Rokeach,
1973; Van Lange, Otten, De Bruin, & Joireman, 1997)” (from Rohan,
2000).
- “A third avenue for future research involves an examination of how
individual differences influence the extent to which status motives lead
to self-sacrifice (e.g., Campbell, Simpson, Stewart, & Manning, 2003;
Kurzban & Houser, 2005; Van Lange, Bekkers, Schuyt, & Van Vugt,
2007; Van Lange, Otten, De Bruin, & Joireman, 1997)” (from
Griskevicius et al., 2010).
- “Social motives may be rooted, for example, in individual differences
in social value orientations (e.g., McClintock & Liebrand, 1988; Van
Lange, Otten, De Bruin, & Joireman, 1997)” (from De Dreu et al.,
2000).
- “In addition to signaling wealth, public philanthropy can also convey
prosocial personality traits (Penner & Finkelstein, 1998; Van Lange,
Otten, DeBruin, & Joireman, 1997)” (from Griskevicius et al., 2007).
- “Although theoretical models of group selection (3, 4), indirect
reciprocity (5–7), and costly signaling (8) have helped to clarify
possible evolutionary routes to cooperation, fundamental questions
remain about the number and nature of the cognitive mechanisms that
underpin human cooperative psychology (9) and whether there are
stable individual differences in these mechanisms (10).” (10 refers to
the Van Lange et al., 1997 article; from Kurzban & Houser, 2004).
Reviewer 2: Second, on page 5, I would caution against suggesting that adult
attachment patterns are a function of "early" experience. The statement
implicitly suggests that later experiences are not relevant. I doubt the authors
believe that, but that is one way to interpret the use of the term "early" rather
than, say, "prior" or "a history of interpersonal experiences."
Authors’ Reply: We agree with the reviewer and changed early to prior. We
did retain “early” in the quote to Van Lange et al.’s work, as it was simply a
quote to their work. Later, when referencing Van Lange et al.’s work, we
include both early and prior.
We hope that by addressing the above concerns, the manuscript is ready for
acceptance for Stage 1 review. If you have any other questions, please do not

Appendix D
Dear. Prof Chambers, dear Chris,
We thank you and the reviewers for your helpful comments. Below we indicate how we
esponded to the reviewers’ concerns:
Reviewer 1: The authors should explicate the number of individuals that could not be
classified. Also there is currently no description of the criterion/cutoff used for the
classification.
Authors’ Response: We have included this information under our Confirmatory Results:
“Our sample included 499 prosocials (65%) and 269 proselfs (35%) and 95 individuals who
could not be classified. If participants answered more than 6 dilemmas in a prosocial manner,
hey were classified as being prosocial”
Reviewer 1: Following my request from the first stage review, the authors have added a
ootnote on the availability of better SVO measures. However, I do not think that this should
be put in a footnote, it deserves to be part of the main body of the discussion. First, the very
philosophy of the authors (which I endorse!) is that replication should make use of the
development of better measures. To be consistent with this thinking, the authors should not
only stress to what extent their paper meets this standard but also point to their failures of
meeting it (although it was clearly not a fault as new SVO instruments were freshly developed
when data collection commenced). This does not weaken the paper but instead makes it more
consistent and convincing. Second, the authors' argument that their SVO scale was highly
consistent based on KR20 is at least difficult. On the one hand, this statistic rests on an
artifical dichotomization of paricipants' answers. On the other hand, it is not surprising to get
a high KR20s given that the triple dominance scales essentially confront participants with
hree highly similar choices (Murphy & Ackermann, 2014, PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV).
Third (and related), the very point about newly developed SVO scales (e.g., Murphy,
Ackermann, & Handgraaf, 2011, JUDGM DECIS MAK) is the insight that gradual
differences in SVO can matter much more than nominal classifications - classifications can
even conceal meaningful differences due to SVO (for illustrations of this important point, see
Bieleke, Gollwitzer, Oettingen, & Fischbacher, 2017, J BEHAV DECIS MAKING; Fiedler,
Glöckner, Nicklisch, & Dickert, 2013, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC). To me, this insight
seems at least as important as the new developments regarding attachment scales stressed in
he present paper. Adressing this point more thoroughly would make the paper a much more
useful contribution for researchers who care about SVO. Moreover, it provides a promising
avenue for future research - which, for instance, might examine whether gradual SVO
differences relate more robustly to attachment.
Authors’ Reponse: We have included the following information now in the discussion and
are more explicit about it being a shortcoming in our research:
Do note however that in 2011, a psychometrically superior measure – the slider
measure – for SVO became available (Murphy, Ackermann, & Handgraaf, 2011). Our
data collection ran from 2011-2014, and the old, measure, with nominal categories,
was still included in our test batteries (despite the superior measure having been
available) and this was a shortcoming of our research. Because the slider measure has
been shown to be superior to our measure (see e.g., Fiedler, Glöckner, Nicklisch, &
Dickert, 2013), whether or not the slider measure does correlate with attachment is
question for future research.
We again include a version with track changes on and track changes accepted to facilitate
eview. We hope that with these changes the manuscript meets the standards to be accepted
or publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Sincerely and also on behalf of Jaap Denissen,
Hans IJzerman
