The authors developed an in-situ preparation method for constructing mesoporous g-
C3N4/MoS2 heterojunctions. The as-prepared materials were analyzed with several tolls and
applied in photocatalytic degradation of RhB. The results indicated that the g-C3N4/MoS2
showed improved photocatalysis due to the promoted charge separation between g-C3N4 and
MoS2. In general, this is an interesting work on an important topic. It can be accepted after minor
revisions.
1. The photocatalytic activity of pure MoS2 should be evaluated.
2. Why the photocurrent of g-C3N4/MoS2 was gradually decreased under irradiation?
3. The MoS2 is not stable. So the reusability of g-C3N4/MoS2 should be evaluated.
4. Some recent advances on g-C3N4 and MoS2 based photocatalysts can be summarized in the
introduction to attract more readerships (Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 2016, 199, 87-95.;

The authors prepared one kind of mesoporous g-C3N4/MoS2 composite and found that the
visible photocatalytic activity of the composite is higher than the pure g-C3N4.They think that the
reason of improved performance is ascribed to strong coupling effect between MoS2 nanosheets
and g-C3N4, and the effective suppression of the recombination of charge carriers. It is a systemic
and interesting work and can be accepted after addressing the following points.

1) It is better to change the title as “synthesis and photocatalytic activity of mesoporous g-

2) Does the porous composite have adsorptivity?
3) The English expression should be improved.

Reply: Thank you so much for your positive comments, and your suggestive comments
are very helpful for further improving our manuscript. According to your good comments,
we now have carefully revised the manuscript.
1. The photocatalytic activity of pure MoS2 should be evaluated.
Reply to 1: Thank you for your suggestion. We have measured the commercial MoS2
powder for photocatalytic activity using same method as other samples. The results have
been updated in the revised main text in figure 6(a).
Figure 6(a) Photocatalytic degradation of RhB.
It can be easily confirmed that as-prepared samples showed higher activity than pure MoS2.
2. Why the photocurrent of g-C3N4/MoS2 was gradually decreased under irradiation?
Reply to 2: The gradual decrease of photocurrent density under light illumination during
the measurement cycles was related to the sample detachment from the FTO surface.
Similar results have also been reported in previous work, such as reference 61 in main
text.

visible-light-responsive photoactivities. Nanoscale. 6, 8796. (10.1039/c4nr01607f)
3. The MoS2 is not stable. So the reusability of g-C3N4/MoS2 should be evaluated.
Reply to 3: Thank you for your suggestion. The stability of the catalysts was confirmed by
repeated cycling measurement. In detail, 50 mg of sample 1.25 % MoS2 were dispersed in
250 mL RhB solution for first cycle measurement. In the second and third cycle, 35 mg and
25 mg sample were collected, respectively. The result was depicted in figure 8 in main text.
Figure 1 Repeated catalytic measurement of sample 1.25% MoS2 for RhB degradation under visible light
irradiation.
As shown in figure 8, after repeated using for 3 cycles, there were no considerable
decrease of photocatalytic efficiency, indicating the stability of as-synthesized g-
C3N4/MoS2 heterojunction catalysts.
4. Some recent advances on g-C3N4 and MoS2 based photocatalysts can be
summarized in the introduction to attract more readerships (Applied Catalysis B:
Environmental, 2016, 199, 87-95.; Environmental Science & Technology, 2018, 52 (3),
1479-1487.; Journal of Catalysis, 2017, 352, 351-360.).
Reply to 4: Thank you for your advice. We have also found these research work helpful to
our work and have included these results in the introduction part as reference 36-38.

Reply: Thank you for your positive recognition. The main text has been carefully revised
according to your valuable advice.
1) It is better to change the title as “synthesis and photocatalytic activity of
mesoporous g-C3N4/MoS2 hybrid catalysts.
Reply to 1: Thank you for this advice. The title has been changed as suggested.
2) Does the porous composite have absorptivity?
Reply to 2: Yes, the absorption of porous catalysts could be measured by the RhB
concentration decrease during dark absorption procedure. The absorption ability of
different samples is relevant to the specific surface area and pore size distribution.
However, during the photocatalytic measurement, the absorption effect should be set apart
from the degradation effect. Therefore, two strategies were introduced in the measurement
procedure to reduce the interference of different absorption ability. Firstly, as stated in the
Experiment part 2.3, ‘The suspension was stirred for 120 min in dark to achieve adsorption
equilibrium before the light irradiation.’ Secondly, ‘the reaction rate was calculated by C/C0,
in which C0 represents the concentration right after dark absorption.’. Reaction rate was
calculated in this way to eliminate the effect different C0 due to different absorption.
3) The English expression should be improved.
Reply to 3: Thank you for your comment. The English has been thoroughly polished.
