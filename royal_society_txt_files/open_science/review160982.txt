This short manuscript presents an interesting comparison of the trophic ecology during the early
breeding season of two regularly co-occurring seabirds, Sabine's gull and Arctic tern. The
methods applied are largely appropriate (although see comment on statistics below), and the
manuscript is well written. My main concern with the manuscript is that the authors draw too
strong conclusions based on what are really quite limited data. They find that Sabine's gulls
during one of two study years appear to feed on terrestrial prey, and based on this they conclude
not only that this is a regular phenomenon (despite this year being unusual in terms of lemming
abundance), but also that the nesting association between Arctic terns and Sabine's gulls may be
due to fertilization of the tundra by the terns and consequent opportunities for terrestrial
foraging by gulls. This speculation may be interesting, but should not be included in the abstract.
The authors should also think very carefully about whether they really can claim that terrestrial
feeding by gulls is regular in this colony.
One thing that could support this claim would be regular observations of gulls feeding in the
colony (including in other years than 2009). Only once (on l. 201-202) are such observations even
mentioned, and it appears that no systematic observations were made. But given that researchers
apparently were present in the colony for a few weeks each study season, they would surely have
noticed if gulls regularly fed there? You should really discuss this, even if you have no
quantitative data.
In the statistics, you mention several times an interaction term (e.g. l. 124). However, with three
predictors (species, year and date), you have potentially three 2-way and one 3-way interaction.
So which one did you include in the model - and why? Given that you don't report this, it is
impossible to assess your claim that isotopic signatures were affected by date in gulls, but not in
terns (l. 172-176 and l 182-183). Fig. 2 doesn't seem to support this claim.
Minor comments:
- Title: although true, it isn't really relevant in this context that the two species are trans-
equatorial migrants.
- Running head: the acronyms SAGU and ARTE are only familiar to North American
ornithologists and should be avoided here.
- l. 67-70: this may be typical habitat for Arctic terns in Canada, but certainly not in Northern
Europe where the species is widely distributed.
- l. 89-99: I suggest restructuring this paragraph. At the moment, it is not clear from the text that
prey were sampled in order to obtain reference stable isotope values for interpretation of results
on blood samples. This should be clarified, and I would suggest mentioning the collection of
blood samples first, since this is the main focus of the manuscript. Also, you should really
mention how birds were caught.
- l. 112: mention whether sampling date was treated as a factor or a covariate (it appears the
latter, but please be explicit).
- l. 138: delta13C was lower for gulls (and overlapped with terrestrial prey) only in 2009!
- l. 148: please refer to Fig. 2 here.
- l. 150: reference error (Jackson and Parnell 2011).
- l. 153; shouldn't this be 13.25‰2?
- l. 166 (and also l. 170): gulls seemed to use terrestrial prey in one year only.
- There are two references numbered 37 ...
- Fig. 1. Please revise the figure, panel a does not show standard ellipse areas (just the ellipses).
Also, it would be very useful if you could somehow show prey isotope signatures as well.

label_comment_2
General:
The main achievement of this paper is the important contribution to evaluate niche segregation
between two seabird species breeding in sympatry in extreme breeding conditions and after a
trans-equatorial migration. Overall, the paper is well-written, well-cited and easy to follow, and
the statistical analyses performed appear correct although I think that authors could have
explored with more detail the biological data obtained using, for instance, SIAR analyses. Most of
my comments below relate to minor edits and I have only a major comment which should be
clarified; authors should elucidate why they did not perform lipid extraction of the tissues, since
lipids may lead to depleted d13C values.
Specific comments:
Summary
L18-20: Please state the studied period
Introduction
L72: ‘small polynya’ it would be useful to indicate the average size of this polynya at this time of
the year, for reference, if possible
L73: replace ‘resources’ with ‘marine resources’! Right?
L76 (and throughout the manuscript): ‘stable isotope signatures’. The word signature should
apply to the isotopic composition of a significant reservoir like the geological mantle, air, ocean,
lakes or a major part of the system being studied, not to the isotopic composition of ordinary
samples. Please change to ‘stable isotope values’.
Methods
During this section (and afterwards in results) I realize that authors did not addressed the issue
of possible depleted d13C values in tissues, due to high concentration of lipids, as the ratios C/N
demonstrate (i.e. > 3.5). Authors did not performed lipid extraction nor corrected the values as
outlined for instance in Post et al. (2007). Thus, authors should clarify this issue and argue why
this procedure was not performed.

L93-94: you sampled blood, and then centrifuged to separate into plasma and blood cells, right?

L109: ‘Vienna- Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB)’ I suppose
L106-110: Please specify the precision for both d13C and d15N, and the standards used
L115-116: ‘and their isotopic signature could have represented food ingested prior to their arrival
at the breeding colony’. If plasma has a complete turnover rate of around 20 days, how could it be
possible to reflect diet prior to their arrival? In July (during sampling) birds were already
incubating and they arrive on June or even earlier, right? Please clarify
Results
L137 (and forwards): please be consistent in the presentation of p values (i.e. indicate the precise
value with 2 or 3 decimal cases (e.g. p = 0.07 or p = 0.002, respectively) or p < 0.001 if it is the case

the manuscript, but it could be a formatting problem
Figure 2: the use of d13C and d15N residuals in this figure should be clarified in the methods
section
Discussion
L166: ‘significant amounts’. Which scientific method (i.e. analyses) did you use to show that the
amounts of terrestrial prey were significant? For instance, you did not perform SIAR analyses in
order to corroborate this statement. I suppose that you used empirical evidence based on your
isotopic data and as so, you should moderate your statement

In this revised version, the authors have addressed most of the previous comments in a clear and
suitable way, and I no longer have any major concerns. In particular, the conclusions are now
limited to those supported by the data, and incidental observations of terrestrial foraging by
Sabine's gulls are mentioned. Following up on my previous comments, I just have a couple of
minor issues:
- Sampling date is clearly not a factor in the model, but a linear covariate. A factor would imply
that there was one level of response for each calendar date when sampling took place. Please
correct.
- I would suggest listing the models fitted and the criteria for model selection (AIC would be
appropriate) in a supplementary table, both for the MANOVA and for the individual GLMs. At
the moment, it is not entirely clear how the authors have arrived at the final model in each case.
- Fig. 2a shows the actual standard ellipses, not their areas. Fig. 2b shows the areas.

appropriate) in a supplementary table, both for the MANOVA and for the individual GLMs. At
the moment, it is not entirely clear how the authors have arrived at the final model in each case.

e: “Diet dichotomy between two trans-equatorial migrant seabirds breeding near a high
tic polynya”
r Editor,
nk you very much for the reviews of our manuscript and for considering our work for
lication in RSOS. We considered the insights and suggestions of the two reviewers valuable
mproving this manuscript compared to the original submission. Thus, we have prepared a
sed version, taking into account all of the reviewers’ suggestions. Following, you will find
response to each concern and comment provided by the reviewers and how we addressed
m in our new version. You will also find a marked up and clean version of our revised
uscript.

mments to the Author(s)
My main concern with the manuscript is that the authors draw too strong conclusions
ed on what are really quite limited data.
SPONSE: We have moderated our conclusion and included more discussion about
at we observed in terms of foraging by the gulls.
y find that Sabine's gulls during one of two study years appear to feed on terrestrial
y, and based on this they conclude not only that this is a regular phenomenon (despite
year being unusual in terms of lemming abundance), but also that the nesting
ociation between Arctic terns and Sabine's gulls may be due to fertilization of the
dra by the terns and consequent opportunities for terrestrial foraging by gulls. This
culation may be interesting, but should not be included in the abstract.
SPONSE: We have deleted that speculation from the abstract and agree that this
ormation should be only in the concluding remarks of the MS.
authors should also think very carefully about whether they really can claim that
estrial feeding by gulls is regular in this colony.
SPONSE: We have added text to clarify that this was a regular observation across
rs (see next point). L 187-189
e thing that could support this claim would be regular observations of gulls feeding in
colony (including in other years than 2009). Only once (on l. 201-202) are such
ervations even mentioned, and it appears that no systematic observations were made.
given that researchers apparently were present in the colony for a few weeks each
dy season, they would surely have noticed if gulls regularly fed there? You should
lly discuss this, even if you have no quantitative data.
SPONSE: We have expanded on this section as suggested, indicating that indeed we
observe terrestrial foraging by gulls in each year that we were there, although our
pling for this project coincided with a year when terrestrial foraging may have been
ticularly high. L 187-189
he statistics, you mention several times an interaction term (e.g. l. 124). However, with
e predictors (species, year and date), you have potentially three 2-way and one 3-way
raction. So which one did you include in the model - and why? Given that you don't
ort this, it is impossible to assess your claim that isotopic signatures were affected by
e in gulls, but not in terns (l. 172-176 and l 182-183). Fig. 2 doesn't seem to support
claim.
SPONSE: In the methods we state how we selected interaction terms (stepwise
oval procedure) and also mentioned the interaction terms that proved significant at
laining variation in the model and thus the interaction terms that were kept in further
M analyses. However, we did make a mistake in the original methods, as the
raction between species and year was significant for <U+F064>13C. We think that this is were
confusion came from for the referee, since we presented the result of this interaction
Results. We have thus clarified this part of the Method section. L 137-138
have also clarified the Results, because for both species, date sampled had an effect
carbon values, and for nitrogen, that relationship was significant across both years.
re was an obvious mistake in the result section, especially for carbon. L 156
nor comments:
tle: although true, it isn't really relevant in this context that the two species are trans-
atorial migrants.
SPONSE: We omitted ‘trans-equatorial’ in the title as suggested.
unning head: the acronyms SAGU and ARTE are only familiar to North American
ithologists and should be avoided here.
SPONSE: We have now simply stated ‘arctic seabirds’ instead of the North American
cies acronyms; running head word limit is too short to state the species name.
67-70: this may be typical habitat for Arctic terns in Canada, but certainly not in
rthern Europe where the species is widely distributed.
SPONSE: We have specified ‘in Canadian Arctic’ to avoid the confusion. L 64
89-99: I suggest restructuring this paragraph. At the moment, it is not clear from the
t that prey were sampled in order to obtain reference stable isotope values for
rpretation of results on blood samples. This should be clarified, and I would suggest
ntioning the collection of blood samples first, since this is the main focus of the
nuscript. Also, you should really mention how birds were caught.
SPONSE: We have followed the suggestions and restructured the paragraph as well as
ed elements concerning the bird capture. L 85-102
112: mention whether sampling date was treated as a factor or a covariate (it appears
latter, but please be explicit).
SPONSE: ‘Species’, ‘year’ and ‘date sampled’ and their interaction were all tested as
lanatory factors.Then, using GLM, we tested the significance of each interaction term
both <U+F064>13C and <U+F064>15N and removed the non-significant one. These steps are clearly stated
he MS. But based on the concern of the referee, we reformulated the first sentence of
paragraph concerning the MANOVA model to add some clarity. L 125-127
138: delta13C was lower for gulls (and overlapped with terrestrial prey) only in 2009!
SPONSE: We have corrected that statement for more clarity. L 153-154
148: please refer to Fig. 2 here.
SPONSE: We have done this as suggested, but this now introduces Fig 2 before Fig 1,
aning that we have renumbered the figures, but actually discuss Fig 2 first in the
ults.
150: reference error (Jackson and Parnell 2011).
SPONSE: We have corrected the reference. L 166
153; shouldn't this be 13.25‰2?
SPONSE: The mean SEAc following the Bayesian approach should be reported here
not the observed one. We corrected the values in that sense. L 167-169
166 (and also l. 170): gulls seemed to use terrestrial prey in one year only.
SPONSE: We have added that this usage of terrestrial prey is particularly noticeable
009, but the elongated ellipse area suggested an influence of terrestrial food sources
o in 2008, and we have added text indicating that we observed gulls foraging in
estrial habitats each year. L 186-191
here are two references numbered 37 ...
SPONSE: We have corrected in the reference list and in the text.
g. 1. Please revise the figure, panel a does not show standard ellipse areas (just the
pses). Also, it would be very useful if you could somehow show prey isotope
natures as well.
SPONSE: We think that there might have been an issue when uploading the figure 1
, as the ellipses are shown on our version of what was uploaded.
have not presented the prey isotopic signatures in the figure 1a panel (now figure 2)
two reasons. First, the prey and bird mean ± SD isotopic values are shown in table 1,
we did not want to duplicate all of that in the figure. Second, we feel that figure 2a is
ady “cluttered” enough with the relevant data on the bird isotopes that we did not wish
onfuse it with prey isotopes as well. Thus, we have not changed this figure as
gested.

neral:
, and the statistical analyses performed appear correct although I think that authors
ld have explored with more detail the biological data obtained using, for instance,
R analyses. Most of my comments below relate to minor edits and I have only a major
ment which should be clarified; authors should elucidate why they did not perform
d extraction of the tissues, since lipids may lead to depleted d13C values.
SPONSE: We chose not to perform SIAR analyses because we knew that we were
ly missing values for some prey items likely found in the birds’ diet (e.g., polychaete
rms, etc.). We have added a line in the methods to clarify that not all the possible prey
ms were collected. L 97
the time that this work was conducted, the extraction of lipids was just starting to
ome “the norm”, particularly for d13C work. Frankly, the MSc student who did the
rk reanalysed some other isotope work the following year where there was sufficient
ple, but not these readings. To that end, we have adjusted the values in this paper to
rect for lipid extraction based on another study.
cific comments:
mmary
8-20: Please state the studied period
SPONSE: We have added this as suggested.
oduction
2: ‘small polynya’ it would be useful to indicate the average size of this polynya at this
e of the year, for reference, if possible
SPONSE: We have added the approximate size of the polynya (10km2) as it is
ntioned also in the Discussion.
3: replace ‘resources’ with ‘marine resources’! Right?
SPONSE: We have replaced as suggested. L 19-20
6 (and throughout the manuscript): ‘stable isotope signatures’. The word signature
uld apply to the isotopic composition of a significant reservoir like the geological
ntle, air, ocean, lakes or a major part of the system being studied, not to the isotopic
position of ordinary samples. Please change to ‘stable isotope values’.
SPONSE: We have replaced as suggested.
thods
ring this section (and afterwards in results) I realize that authors did not addressed the
e of possible depleted d13C values in tissues, due to high concentration of lipids, as
ratios C/N demonstrate (i.e. > 3.5). Authors did not performed lipid extraction nor
rected the values as outlined for instance in Post et al. (2007). Thus, authors should
ify this issue and argue why this procedure was not performed.
SPONSE: As indicated above, at the time that we were doing this work, lipid
raction was just becoming the norm – our work to date had largely been with eggs and
nitoring where we did not require lipid extraction and correction. However, based on
referee’s suggestion, we have used the method suggested by Post et al. (2007) to
malize our <U+F064>13C value for lipids for the two birds and the food items in provenance of
marine ecosystem. We added a line in the Methods and adjusted the values associated
h subsequent analyses in our results. Overall, that correction did not change the
clusion of our MS. L 119-123

3-94: you sampled blood, and then centrifuged to separate into plasma and blood cells,

SPONSE: We have amended as suggested. L 86-87

SPONSE: We have added this information in the Methods. L 110-111

SPONSE: Yes, we have corrected as suggested. L 112-113

val at the breeding colony’. If plasma has a complete turnover rate of around 20 days,
w could it be possible to reflect diet prior to their arrival? In July (during sampling)
ds were already incubating and they arrive on June or even earlier, right? Please clarify
SPONSE: We agree with the referee, in that our original statement was confusing. We
eted the statement and replaced ‘prior to’ with ‘at their arrival’, which is more
ropriate in that case (especially for 2008) based on the turnover rate of plasma, as
unced by the referee. L 128

cise value with 2 or 3 decimal cases (e.g. p = 0.07 or p = 0.002, respectively) or p <
01 if it is the case
SPONSE: We have made all changes as suggested.

SPONSE: We have added the probabilistic p-values that were very small. L 168, 170-
ure 1: Insert (a) and (b) in the figure. Figure 1 also appears in a rose colour in this
sion of the manuscript, but it could be a formatting problem
SPONSE: We have added the letters as suggested, and yes it was an up-loading
blem for the pink colour.
ure 2: the use of d13C and d15N residuals in this figure should be clarified in the
thods section
SPONSE: We have added an explanation in the Methods to clarify the choice of
resentation of residuals against date sampled. L 141-142
cussion
66: ‘significant amounts’. Which scientific method (i.e. analyses) did you use to show
t the amounts of terrestrial prey were significant? For instance, you did not perform
R analyses in order to corroborate this statement. I suppose that you used empirical
dence based on your isotopic data and as so, you should moderate your statement
SPONSE: We have tempered this statement as suggested because we did not perform
R model work based on the rationale explained above. L 182
lectively, we think that these changes have clearly strengthened and clarified the
nuscript, and we appreciate the thoughtful insights of the referees. We hope that with
se changes, you can now accept our manuscript for publication in Royal Society Open
ence.

eral:
hors have revised the manuscript, and I think it is now improved and clear. After read
urately the entire manuscript I only have a few minor comments/suggestions:
cific comments:
6: replace with ‘to separate the plasma from the blood cells’
SPONSE: Replaced as mentioned. L107
2: replace ‘parts per thousand (or per mil; ‰)’ with ‘“parts per mil” (‰)’
SPONSE: Replaced as mentioned. L113
2: ‘around d13C -19‰’. After normalization? I would suggest, along the ms., to use ‘d13CN’
n stating normalized data
SPONSE: Replaced as mentioned by using <U+F064>13Cn throughout the text when referring to <U+F064>13C
malized.
ure 1: This figure seems exactly the same as the one from the previous version! The use of
C normalized values did not affect the residuals??
SPONSE: We effectively changed the figure 1, and added trend lines for each grouping
able (species and year) so the reader could better visualize the effect of sampling date on both
ope values.

mments to the Author(s)
his revised version, the authors have addressed most of the previous comments in a clear and
able way, and I no longer have any major concerns. In particular, the conclusions are now
ited to those supported by the data, and incidental observations of terrestrial foraging by
ine's gulls are mentioned. Following up on my previous comments, I just have a couple of
or issues:
mpling date is clearly not a factor in the model, but a linear covariate. A factor would imply
there was one level of response for each calendar date when sampling took place. Please
ect.
SPONSE: It is correct, and we replaced the term factor by linear covariate in our Method.

would suggest listing the models fitted and the criteria for model selection (AIC would be
ropriate) in a supplementary table, both for the MANOVA and for the individual GLMs. At
moment, it is not entirely clear how the authors have arrived at the final model in each case.
SPONSE: Following this suggestion, we used AICc model selection the model that best
lained variation in nitrogen and carbon values, we explained our method in the Method
ion, and added a model selection table as Supplementary Material (S1). We then present the
lts of the best GLM model and the effect of the explanatory variables (F-statistic) in the
ults. L133-142
believe that AIC is not possible for multivariate model (MANOVA), for which the
ificance of the explanatory variables and their interaction was tested with the F-statistic, as
orted in the Results (L154).
g. 2a shows the actual standard ellipses, not their areas. Fig. 2b shows the areas.
SPONSE: We corrected the figure caption as suggested.
