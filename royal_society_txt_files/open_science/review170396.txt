This is a useful study determining the factors that affect density, visibility and search efficiency of
crown of thorns starfish. Although there have been several such studies on the Great Barrier Reef
in Australia this is the first I am aware of on a major coral reef system in another country and
given the differences in such systems and the characteristics of populations and outbreaks and
their interaction with global change, this new study warrants publication.
Although the study is well conceived, designed, executed, analysed and written, there are two
main improvements that should be made ahead of publication.
The first is that the study should use the primary literature on this topic, much of which is
omitted. In general I think a greater attempt should be made to locate the primary literature
rather than rely principally on more recent work. For example, around line 160, the authors
suggest there are few studies that have assessed bias in detection of crown of thorns in order to
help strengthen management. They cite three papers from 2013, 2016 and 2016 despite this topic
receiving much attention in the 1990s. For example:
Fernandes, L., Marsh, H., Moran, P.J. and Sinclair, D., 1990. Bias in manta tow surveys of
Acanthaster planci. Coral Reefs, 9(3), pp.155-160.
Moran, P.J. and De'Ath, G., 1992. Estimates of the abundance of the crown-of-thorns starfish
Acanthaster planci in outbreaking and non-outbreaking populations on reefs within the Great
Barrier Reef. Marine Biology, 113(3), pp.509-515.
Keesing, J.K., 1995. Temporal patterns in the feeding and emergence behaviour of the
crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci. Marine & Freshwater Behaviour & Physiology, 25(4),
pp.209-232.
The latter of these is a very similar study from the Great Barrier Reef which describes the patterns
of nocturnal/diurnal behaviour and reflects in the importance of this for survey and control
programs which is the main point of the current MS.
There may be other earlier papers, I only had a quick look based on some knowledge of this
literature.
The second suggested improvement is that the discussion would benefit from a fuller discussion
of the results using some of this literature referred to above as well as Death and Moran (1998)
which is already referenced. Four examples of this are:
- the results from the current MS did not find differences in density between areas of
higher and lower relief. This differs in some respects from the study of Fernandes et al 1990 who
found that detectability did differ. This present the opportunity for some useful comparison.
- Keesing (1995) and De’ath and Moran (1998) found the same sorts of patterns in
nocturnal and diurnal behaviour as in the new MS but quite interesting differences in the diel
behaviour between small and large adults which might different from Moorea.
- Both the above authors analysed some of the same factors affecting cryptic and emergent
behaviour (e.g. depth, coral cover, distribution) as in the new MS and it would be useful to
discuss the similarity or differences in these findings.
- Doherty and Davidson (1988) were mindful of the diurnal behaviour patterns and
designed night surveys in their study to detect juvenile crown of thorns only to find that despite
the starfish being more active and less concealed then, other factors made search efficiency and
thus density estimates much lower.

juvenile Acanthaster planci in the central Great Barrier Reef. In Proceedings of the 6th
International Coral Reef Symposium, Townsville, Australia 8-12 August 1988-pages: 2: 131-136.

Other minor issues:
Figure 2 has nine graphs but only one uses the full Y axis range of 0-40. None of the others have a
value above 12 making them a bit hard to read. I suggest those 8 graphs be changed to have a Y
axis range of 0-20. There is no need for uniformity in the scales of the Y axis in all figures.

Comments to Authors
This ms shows that surveys of COTS should include nighttime survey’s as they show there is a
greater abundance of COTS at night. Therefore the author’s speculate based on this result that
management decisions based only on diurnal survey’s can undermine population control efforts
to manage this pest and thus reduce the ability of reefs to recover. Overall the authors should be
commended on their efforts in survey’s particularly those conducted at night that is no easy task
and the time taken to analyse these findings. However several issues have been identified in
methodology and discussion expanded on as general comments. I have also identified other
minor edits.
General comments
An important issue arose with the methodology that could affect results and interpretation. There
was no indication of target sizes of COTS surveyed in the methodology. As size variation is an
important consideration an indication of survey sizes needs to be included in the methodology.
Variation in sizes surveyed in studies, should also form a part of the discussion as this may be the
driver for differences in results when compared to other surveys and expanded on in detail in
discussion if they differ.
4
When compared with a novel and published study cited (11) in the reference list that also took
into account nighttime surveys but produced contradicting results, only adults were surveyed,
not juveniles. Therefore an indication of sizes surveyed should be made before further
consideration.
I would also suggest that the discussion be expanded on to make a thorough comparison of the
methodology used in both studies. I believe this study uses some very credible survey
techniques in both study design and interpretation of results that should form part of the
discussion.
I would also suggest a greater discussion of methods available and/or under development that
may have improved this study.
I don’t believe in the strength of these results to make bold statements about and form a
discussion about how this can undermine management efforts as these results have not been
transferable to a determination of catch efforts during outbreaks at both day and night in the
design as in previous study (11).
Other issues I have with the design is the larger temporal scale of the survey area that could
introduce a higher scale of error from both human and movement of COTS within study area,
especially without the use of other methodologies like mark and recapture.
I would suggest the discussion be more focused on methodology and how to improve this study
if inferences of the inclusion of night time survey’s to management efforts are to be made in
future. As this is a preliminary finding that contradicts only one other similar study, that was able
to incorporate various methods in.

Thank you for this information. The referred article by Keesing (1995) is indeed relevant to our study
and the associated discussion about the mechanisms that generate differences in COTS detection
between day and night observations (as now mentioned in Discussion l. 145-147).
The two other referred studies by Fernandes et al. (1990) and Moran & De’ath (1992) are focused
strictly on comparing COTS abundance as estimated by manta-tow versus scuba-swim techniques, and
do not directly relate to our study. Indeed, manta-tow and scuba-swim methodologies differ
fundamentally, particularly in terms of the distance of the observer from the reef substrate and the time
dedicated to search a given reef area. Therefore, the mechanisms explaining differences between these
two techniques cannot directly be related to our work. We nevertheless added reference to the Moran
& De’ath paper when referring to the density threshold that is indicative of a COTS outbreak
(Methods l. 85).
We also changed our previously broad sentence “few studies have tested for potential bias in COTS
detection to help strengthen management of coral reef resources” to the more specific “potential bias
in COTS survey methodology might preclude efficient management of coral reef resources” (l. 172-
174).

The study by Fernandes et al. (1990) evaluates the effects of reef substrate complexity on differences
in COTS abundance as estimated by two fundamentally different survey methodology (manta-tow
versus scuba-swim), and cannot be directly related to our study (comparing seastar abundance as
estimated by day versus night with a same methodology). As stated above, we have now amended the
text to focus more specifically on differences in estimations of COTS abundance between day and
night (l. 172-174).
- Keesing (1995) and De’ath and Moran (1998) found the same sorts of patterns in nocturnal and
diurnal behaviour as in the new MS but quite interesting differences in the diel behaviour between
small and large adults which might different from Moorea.
- Both the above authors analysed some of the same factors affecting cryptic and emergent
behaviour (e.g. depth, coral cover, distribution) as in the new MS and it would be useful to discuss the
similarity or differences in these findings.
We did not measure individual seastar sizes for the purpose of the present study, although we now
provide an indication of the observed size range (predominantly large individuals 30-45 cm in
diameter) in Methods (l. 67-69) and Discussion (l. 155-157).
Variation in COTS’s behaviour in relation to individual size, water depth, and other factors is
mentioned in Introduction l. 49-51 and Discussion 145-147 & 151-155 where we notably refer to the
studies by Keesing (1995) and De’ath & Moran (1998).
- Doherty and Davidson (1988) were mindful of the diurnal behaviour patterns and designed night
surveys in their study to detect juvenile crown of thorns only to find that despite the starfish being
more active and less concealed then, other factors made search efficiency and thus density estimates
much lower.
Doherty, P.P. and Davidson, J.J., 1988, January. Monitoring the distribution and abundance of
juvenile Acanthaster planci in the central Great Barrier Reef. In Proceedings of the 6th International
Coral Reef Symposium, Townsville, Australia 8-12 August 1988-pages: 2: 131-136.
This study by Doherty & Davidson used mainly a destructive sampling strategy to evaluate COTS
abundance (breaking reef substrate apart in search of the seastar). The authors also performed few
non-destructive surveys, in the form of night counts, that were performed on a limited number of the
reefs. However, such non-destructive counts were not performed by day, which otherwise could have
been compared to their nocturnal observations. Therefore, the findings of this study cannot be
compared to our results.
Nevertheless, we added a reference to this study when mentioning the cryptic behaviour of COTS
(Introduction l. 49-51).

Other minor issues:
Figure 2 has nine graphs but only one uses the full Y axis range of 0-40. None of the others have a
value above 12 making them a bit hard to read. I suggest those 8 graphs be changed to have a Y axis
range of 0-20. There is no need for uniformity in the scales of the Y axis in all figures.
This seems to be a minor detail. If the design is fine for the journal, it is our preference to keep the
figure axes consistent (as they are now) to facilitate comparisons among the different plots.

This ms shows that surveys of COTS should include nighttime survey’s as they show there is a greater
abundance of COTS at night. Therefore the author’s speculate based on this result that management
decisions based only on diurnal survey’s can undermine population control efforts to manage this pest
and thus reduce the ability of reefs to recover. Overall the authors should be commended on their
efforts in survey’s particularly those conducted at night that is no easy task and the time taken to
analyse these findings. However several issues have been identified in methodology and discussion
expanded on as general comments. I have also identified other minor edits.
General comments
An important issue arose with the methodology that could affect results and interpretation. There was
no indication of target sizes of COTS surveyed in the methodology. As size variation is an important
consideration an indication of survey sizes needs to be included in the methodology. Variation in sizes
surveyed in studies, should also form a part of the discussion as this may be the driver for differences
in results when compared to other surveys and expanded on in detail in discussion if they differ.
As mentioned above, we did not measure individual seastar sizes for the purpose of the present study,
although we now provide an indication of the observed size range (predominantly large 30-45 cm
diameter individuals) in Methods (l. 67-69) and Discussion (l. 155-157).
When compared with a novel and published study cited (11) in the reference list that also took into
account nighttime surveys but produced contradicting results, only adults were surveyed, not
juveniles. Therefore an indication of sizes surveyed should be made before further consideration.
Relative similarity in COTS size-distribution with the recent study is now reported l. 155-157.
I would also suggest that the discussion be expanded on to make a thorough comparison of the
methodology used in both studies. I believe this study uses some very credible survey techniques in
both study design and interpretation of results that should form part of the discussion.
I would also suggest a greater discussion of methods available and/or under development that may
have improved this study.
Additional information about differences in methodology between the two studies and limitations has
been added to Discussion in the paragraph expanding l. 145-164.

I don’t believe in the strength of these results to make bold statements about and form a discussion
about how this can undermine management efforts as these results have not been transferable to a
determination of catch efforts during outbreaks at both day and night in the design as in previous
study (11).
A major methodological difference between the two studies is that the previous work (reference 11)
used a tagging system where individual seastars were marked during the day and searched for at night;
whereas our surveys involved non-invasive observations of the same reef areas by day and night (now
further explained in Discussion l. 156-160). While allowing for an identification of individual seastars
and recognition of their movements in and out of the search zone, tagging COTS also involves several
disadvantages that are associated with manipulating the seastars and potentially changing their
behaviour, particularly as injured COTS are more vulnerable to predators and diseases (see Pratchett et
al. 2014 [Oceanogr. & Mar. Biol.: Ann. Rev.]; Cowan et al. 2017 [Diversity]).
Besides, the two studies differed in environmental context as the recent study was performed in
fragmented lagoonal habitats exhibiting relatively low COTS densities, whereas our study was
performed on continuous outer-reef habitats that were affected by waves of dense COTS aggregations
(as explained in Discussion l. 160-164).
Other issues I have with the design is the larger temporal scale of the survey area that could introduce
a higher scale of error from both human and movement of COTS within study area, especially without
the use of other methodologies like mark and recapture.
As mentioned above, the tagging technique has both advantages and limitations for studying COTS
populations, and cannot necessarily be considered superior to a non-invasive approach.
Our data analysis accounted for the complex structure of our sampling design, which consisted in
temporally-replicated observations (longitudinal data) performed on COTS populations moving
through individually-identified permanent-transects established at 3 water depths on 3 different reefs
(explained in Methods l. 91-95 & 111-113).
I would suggest the discussion be more focused on methodology and how to improve this study if
inferences of the inclusion of night time survey’s to management efforts are to be made in future. As
this is a preliminary finding that contradicts only one other similar study, that was able to incorporate
various methods in.
As stated above, information on methodological differences with previous studies and limitations has
been added to the manuscript. We have also added reference to a previous study by Keesing (1995
[Mar. Freshwater. Behav. Physiol.]) whose study design and results are relevant to this discussion
(Discussion l. 145-147).

Page 2, line 29 Remove globally as it maybe miss leading, COTS outbreaks only occur within the Indo
Pacific region not globally.
This term has been removed.
Page 2, line 31 I would suggest rewording ‘Change coral reef trajectory’ to the future of coral reefs.
We reworded the sentence to “the trajectory of coral reefs”.
Introduction:
Page 3, line 39, I would suggest not to use the word mortality but change to widespread decline of
coral reefs, as some may potentially recover from COTS outbreaks.
The term “mortality” was changed to “decline”.
Page 3, line 44, Reference 9 is incomplete in the reference list, and should be replaced with a more
current reference.
Additional information has been added to complete this reference. We could not find a more recent
work on this topic (evaluation of the socio-economic impacts of COTS), and recent research seems to
still rely on this reference (eg, Stoeckl et al. 2011 [Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.])
Page 3, line 44, I would suggest to change the global reference to “across the Indo’-Pacific. This
makes direct reference to outbreaks only occurring in the Indo Pacific.
This sentence has no global reference as the entire paragraph is focused on Indo-Pacific reefs where
COTS is observed (stated l. 38-40 and 54-58).
Page 3, line 50, I would suggest making two sentences, beginning the second sentence from though.
Starting at However this may be dependent on other factors.
We reduced the length of this sentence by removing “searching for”.
Page 3, line 53, I would suggest changing to across various time scales of observation.
We now specify “spatio-temporal scales of observation”.

Page 8, line 169, Reference 3,6 I would omit.
The references have now been omitted from this sentence.
