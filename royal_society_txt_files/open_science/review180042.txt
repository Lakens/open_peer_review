The manuscript of Claus Nielsen “Origin of the trochophora larva” favors the trochaea
hypotheses about the origin of ciliary bands in trochophore larvae after the ciliary lineage
relationships recently found in Crepidula. The title should perhaps restrict to the Origin of ciliary
bands in trochophore larvae because that is the central object of the discussion.
I do not find the lineage argument convincing because it does not conform to modern
understanding of developmental gene expression, which not always follows a direct relationship
to lineage. So, cells from different lineages may end up having similar regulatory states, such as
the pharyngeal musculature of C. elegans.
Furthermore, amphistomy is central to the trochaea theory, but the reference cited (#30) actually
challenges the existence of amphistomy.
Without these two arguments there is not much substance left in this review.
The arguments relies in an exaggerated invariability of a spiral-cleavage fate map that does not
fully conform to reality, as pointed by Anderson, 1966, “The comparative embryology of the
Polychaeta.” and many others afterwards.
For example, contrary to the generalization in Pg.2 L21-24, the primary trochoblasts in the
polychaete Hydroides elegans are the eight 1q221 and 1q212 cells, see the lineage (Arenas-Mena,
2007) and ciliated cell gene expression (Arenas-Mena et al., 2007), two manuscripts that should
have been discussed in this review.
Pg.3. “The origin of the trochophora larva has not been much discussed in modern times.” That is
not the case, see Arenas-Mena and Li, 2014; Arenas-Mena, 2010, and Arenas-Mena, 2013.
Pg. 3. L5-8. There is a presumption of lineage relationship among abutting ciliated cells that is not
warranted as discussed above.
Pg.2.L17 Provide a reference for “The cerebral ganglia very often carry a pair of eyes” and
perhaps explain also the origin of larval and adult eyes.

Review of the mamuscript: “Origin of the trochophora larva” by Claus Nielsen.
This is a nice short manuscript with a clear message regarding the evolution of the ciliated
trochophora larvae that are characteristic for the Lophotrochozoa aka Spiralia. It uses new
published lineage data to test two conflicting hypotheses on the origin of the trochophora, the
planuloid hypothesis and the trochaea theory.
The simple conclusion is that the new data support the trochaea theory.
The trochophora larva carries three parallel transverse ciliated bands from anterior to posterior.
Most anteriorly lies the prototroch, which is followed by the metatroch and by the telotroch at the
posterior end of the larva. The planuloid theory considers these bands the banded remnants of an
overall ciliated ancestral larva. In contrast, the trochaea theory considers these three bands the
remnant of one single original ciliated band that was running around the slit-like opening of an
ancestral gastric cavity. The gastric slit closed, leaving two longitudinal ciliated bands running
left and right alongside the new ventral midline, as well as an oral loop around the new mouth
and an anal loop around the new anus.
To challenge these theories, Nielsen uses new embryonic lineage data from the snail Crepidula.
The cells of the trochophora larva with spiral cleavage pattern emerge in rings (or quartets) of
cells, budded off from the large posterior blastomeres towards the anterior.
Following the planuloid theory, the ciliated bands (proto-, meta-, and telotroch) should emerge
from consecutive rings, depending on their anterior-posterior position. Following the trochaea
theory, the ciliated bands should instead stem from one and the same ring and fold in the course
of evolution to serve as a food-collecting system.
In essence, the new Crepidula data shows that the three ciliary bands, prototroch, metatroch and
telotroch indeed form from one and the same quartet called 2q (2a,b,c, and 2d), which lends
support to the trochaea theory. Pointing that out, the manuscript makes and important and valid
point for biologists interested in zoology and body plan evolution and should thus find its home
in Open Science.
However, the main message needs better explanation and illustration to be fully accessible for the
reader.
1) Most important, an illustration of both theories is needed and how they derive the ciliary
bands of the trochophora. The trochaea theory is quite complicated and the predictions of this
theory regarding the embryonic lineage of the ciliary bands is otherwise not comprehensible. This
4
is so far missing.
2) The author needs to better explain (and best, illustrate, the predictions of both theories
regarding the lineage of the ciliary bands. Only then, this information can be used to understand
the significance of Figure 1c, which shows that the Crepidula ciliary bands all come from the
same micromere quartet. In summary, I propose to add at least one additional figure to the
manuscript, which will require some thoughtful design, as well as changes in the text.
Minor points:
Page 2 line 38 should read: “Their descendents may arrange to form a complete ring, or cells of
the 3rd micromere quartet may fill the gaps [15].”

Associate Editor's comments (Dr David Ferrier):
Both expert reviewers have highlighted where this manuscript could be improved, to make it
clearer for readers to understand as well as incorporate further relevant information from the
literature that may well lead to a more cautionary tone in the conclusion (and perhaps an outline
for specific further work).
Overall the reviewers comments are asking for a clearer outline of the bigger picture and main
take-home message, whilst not neglecting some of the potentially contradictory data.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Claus,
Thank you for your revisions to the manuscript and your responses to each of the referees’
points.
The principal revision that was required was the addition of a figure to clarify the difference
between the planuloid and trochaea theories in terms of the embryonic origins of the ciliary
bands. Whilst you have modified your figures to help clarify the changes to larval bands in the
two theories, which is valuable, this is not what was really being asked for by reviewer 2. Much
of your text discusses the cell lineages involved in ciliary band development, and reviewer 2
highlighted how such cell lineage data can be used to support one theory or the other. The
summary that reviewer 2 provided (as long as you agree with its accuracy and appropriateness)
is still not clearly made in the revised manuscript. If this summary provided by the referee can be
captured by a new figure then this would make a significant improvement to the paper and make
it much more accessible to a wider readership.
Such a figure would clearly be very valuable in moving the planuloid/trochaea debate forward,
and so this figure must become a condition for acceptance of the manuscript. Paraphrasing the
clear summary provided by reviewer 2 and capturing this in a new figure would be appropriate.
Best regards,
Dave
Editor comments:
I agree that the reviewer's request for a clearer explanation and another figure would be an
essential addition and I look forward to this. Thanks.

Comments to the Author:
The author has made every effort to accommodate the reviewers’ and editor’s comments or has
made clear justifications in the instances where there is disagreement. As such the manuscript is
now suitable for publication, following to correction of the small number of typos listed below
(note line numbers are taken from the author’s annotated manuscript containing the tracked
changes).
1) Line 40: change ‘os’ to ‘is’.
2) Line 43: insert ‘a’ to read, “only a few”.
3) Line 57: insert ‘the’ to read, “explains the origin”.
4) Line 62: delete one of the uses of ’collecting’ to read, “downstream-particle collecting system”.
5) Line 63: insert ‘in’ to read, “found in the”.
14
6) Line 161: I suggest changing ‘further’ to ‘also’ to read, “and also to the”.
7) Line 178: change “does neither account” to “neither accounts”.
8) Lines 206-207: the sentence starting ‘Lecithotrophic larvae lack…” would be clearer if
reworded to something like, “Lecithotrophic larvae can lack the metatroch, having either the
prototroch and metatroch or only the prototroch”.
9) I also have one minor comment that relates to previous discussions following from the
referee’s comment about trying to produce a figure illustrating the contrasting embryology of the
ciliary bands for the two theories, which the author has replied to convincingly to explain why
such a cell-lineage type of figure cannot really be produced because of the nature of the Ivanova-
Kazas theory.
Line 226 contains mention of the Ivanova-Kazas theory not being supported by any cell-lineage
study. I now understand why this cannot easily be represented in a figure, but I think that
providing a few more words as to what might be expected for a cell-lineage study that does
support the Ivanova-Kazas theory (to provide a clear contrast to the cell lineage support for the
trochaea theory) would be very valuable for readers. Otherwise the statement about the Ivanova-
Kazas theory not being supported by any cell lineage study is rather difficult to comprehend or
justify.
This could either be done at the point of line 226 in the Conclusion or around lines 178-180, where
mention is made of the complicated shape of the 2nd micrometer quartet.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
My revised manuscript has now been uploaded.
It has been nice to see that Reviewer #2 has wanted extra illustrations added top
explain the two alternative theories in detail. I have added them.
The points raised by Reviewer #1 have been more difficult to deal with. It appears
that the reviewer more or less disregards the information from the numerous
detailed cell-lineage studies from more than a century, including very recent studies
using modern blastomere marking. Only gene expression studies seem to be of
importance. I have made it more explicit that there is practically no variations over
the common cell-lineage of all the many spiralian species studied, and that the
spiralian cell-lineage diagram originating more than hundred years ago is accepted
in all the papers and textbooks that I am aware of. The very few studies of gene
expression are deal with one mollusk and one annelid, and uses different genes, so I
cannot see that there is any doubt about the validity of the classical spiralian.
I hope that I have presented my opinion sufficiently clearly, and that the manuscript
can now be accepted for publication.
With best regards. Yours, Claus Nielsen.
Reviewer #1
The manuscript of Claus Nielsen “Origin of the trochophora larva” favors the
trochaea hypotheses about the origin of ciliary bands in trochophore larvae after
the ciliary lineage relationships recently found in Crepidula. The title should perhaps
restrict to the Origin of ciliary bands in trochophore larvae because that is the
central object of the discussion.
<U+25CF>The trochaea theory originally focused on the ciliary bands, but the modern
version of the theory (Fig. 1) includes the evolution of mouth and anus from the
ancestral blastopore and the origin of the CNS with cerebral ganglia from the first
micromere quartet and the ventral nervous system, with ventral nerves and oral
and anal loops, from the second micromere quartet. So I think that it is a theory for
the origin of the whole larva<U+25CF>
I do not find the lineage argument convincing because it does not conform to
modern understanding of developmental gene expression, which not always follows
a direct relationship to lineage. So, cells from different lineages may end up having
similar regulatory states, such as the pharyngeal musculature of C. elegans.
<U+25CF>But I know of only very few studies of gene expression in the ciliated cells. (By the
way, I may refer to my paper: Nielsen, C & Martinez, P. 2003. Patterns of gene
expression: homology or homocracy? Dev. Genes Evol. 213, 149-154). The old
studies of van den Biggelaar’s group mainly concern Patella. The newer studies from
the Arena-Mena’s group show gene expression changing through embryology (as
should be expected). With only few studies of only molluscs and annelids using
different genes, I cannot see how these studies can contribute to the discussion. All
studies, both classical (based on direct observations of living embryos) and modern
(based on blastomere marking), agree on a remarkable conservative pattern with
the primary (and accessory) trochoblasts (and the cerebral ganglia) from the first
micromere quartet, and the meta- and telotroch (and the ventral nervous system)
from the second micromere quartet. This has been made more explicit in the text.<U+25CF>
Furthermore, amphistomy is central to the trochaea theory, but the reference cited
(#30) actually challenges the existence of amphistomy.
<U+25CF>A reference to the observations of blastopore closure in Hydroides by Arenas-
Mena and Li (2014) which shows the blastopore closing by amphistomy, a later
stage with closed the posterior opening, but a new anus develops from cells of the
same region. The wrong reference( #30) has been deleted<U+25CF>
Without these two arguments there is not much substance left in this review.
The arguments relies in an exaggerated invariability of a spiral-cleavage fate map
that does not fully conform to reality, as pointed by Anderson, 1966, “The
comparative embryology of the Polychaeta.” and many others afterwards.
<U+25CF>The variation, discussed by Anderson, deals with variations in the development of
cilia on the primary, accessory and secondary prototroch cells. This is discussed in
the text.<U+25CF>
For example, contrary to the generalization in Pg.2 L21-24, the primary trochoblasts
in the polychaete Hydroides elegans are the eight 1q221 and 1q212 cells, see the
lineage (Arenas-Mena, 2007) and ciliated cell gene expression (Arenas-Mena et al.,
2007), two manuscripts that should have been discussed in this review.
<U+25CF>The 1q221 and 1q212 are descendants of the 1q2 cells as mentioned in the text<U+25CF>
Pg.3. “The origin of the trochophora larva has not been much discussed in modern
times.” That is not the case, see; Arenas-Mena, 2010, and Arenas-Mena, 2013
<U+25CF> But this is still only very few papers. here is a discussion of the origin of the
trochophora larva in first-mentioned paper, and that is now mentioned in my text.
However, in principle it resembles the theory of Ivanova-Kazas. By the way, several
of the Arenas-Mena papers show diagrams with the blastopore becoming divided
through amphistomy (and the anus closes in a later stage).<U+25CF>
Pg. 3. L5-8. There is a presumption of lineage relationship among abutting ciliated
cells that is not warranted as discussed above.
<U+25CF>I simply disagree. There is strong evidence for the conserved pattern, accepted by
all authors that I know of<U+25CF>
Pg.2.L17 Provide a reference for “The cerebral ganglia very often carry a pair of
eyes” and perhaps explain also the origin of larval and adult eyes.
<U+25CF>The eyes are mentioned en passant, and I don’t think that this is the place for a
discussion. The sentence could be deleted<U+25CF>
Pg. 2. L29. Capitella teleta. <U+25CF>corrected<U+25CF>
Pg. 2. L49. Include and discuss planktotrophic trochophore lineage and gene
expression studies in Hydroides elegans mentioned above and general observations
in other serpulids, Hatschek, 1885; Shearer, 1911.
<U+25CF>Studies on Hydroides are now incorporated. I fail to see what the two old studies
can contribute<U+25CF>

Reviewer #2
This is a nice short manuscript with a clear message regarding the evolution of the
ciliated trochophora larvae that are characteristic for the Lophotrochozoa aka
Spiralia. It uses new published lineage data to test two conflicting hypotheses on the
origin of the trochophora, the planuloid hypothesis and the trochaea theory.
The simple conclusion is that the new data support the trochaea theory.
The trochophora larva carries three parallel transverse ciliated bands from anterior
to posterior. Most anteriorly lies the prototroch, which is followed by the metatroch
and by the telotroch at the posterior end of the larva. The planuloid theory
considers these bands the banded remnants of an overall ciliated ancestral larva. In
contrast, the trochaea theory considers these three bands the remnant of one single
original ciliated band that was running around the slit-like opening of an ancestral
gastric cavity. The gastric slit closed, leaving two longitudinal ciliated bands running
left and right alongside the new ventral midline, as well as an oral loop around the
new mouth and an anal loop around the new anus.
To challenge these theories, Nielsen uses new embryonic lineage data from the snail
Crepidula. The cells of the trochophora larva with spiral cleavage pattern emerge in
rings (or quartets) of cells, budded off from the large posterior blastomeres towards
the anterior.
Following the planuloid theory, the ciliated bands (proto-, meta-, and telotroch)
should emerge from consecutive rings, depending on their anterior-posterior
position. Following the trochaea theory, the ciliated bands should instead stem from
one and the same ring and fold in the course of evolution to serve as a food-
collecting system.
In essence, the new Crepidula data shows that the three ciliary bands, prototroch,
metatroch and telotroch indeed form from one and the same quartet called 2q
(2a,b,c, and 2d), which lends support to the trochaea theory. Pointing that out, the
manuscript makes and important and valid point for biologists interested in zoology
and body plan evolution and should thus find its home in Open Science.
However, the main message needs better explanation and illustration to be fully
accessible for the reader.
1) Most important, an illustration of both theories is needed and how they derive
the ciliary bands of the trochophora. The trochaea theory is quite complicated and
the predictions of this theory regarding the embryonic lineage of the ciliary bands is
otherwise not comprehensible. This is so far missing.
<U+25CF>A diagram explaining the trochaea theory has now been added and changes made
in the text<U+25CF>
2) The author needs to better explain (and best, illustrate, the predictions of both
theories regarding the lineage of the ciliary bands. Only then, this information can
be used to understand the significance of Figure 1c, which shows that the Crepidula
ciliary bands all come from the same micromere quartet. In summary, I propose to
add at least one additional figure to the manuscript, which will require some
thoughtful design, as well as changes in the text.
<U+25CF>An illustration showing the theory of Ivanova-Kazas has been added with
explanations. Cell-lineage is not discussed in the theory<U+25CF>
Page 2 line 38 should read: “Their descendents may arrange to form a complete
ring, or cells of the 3rd micromere quartet may fill the gaps [15].” OK
Pg. 2. L49. Include and discuss planktotrophic trochophore lineage and gene
expression studies in Hydroides elegans mentioned above and general observations
in other serpulids, Hatschek, 1885; Shearer, 1911.
<U+25CF>Studies on Hydroides are now incorporated. I fail to see what the two old studies
can contribute<U+25CF>

sponse to reviewers’ comments.
ter looking at the comments of the referees, I decided to reorganize the text to make the
tinctions between the two theories more clear. I have further made it clear, that the manuscript
es not discuss the planuloid-acoeloid theory or the intercalation theory. This would have made a
ch longer manuscript (and I have discussed this in detail elsewhere).
ope that I have made it clear that it is impossible to make an illustration showing a cell-lineage of
embryo according to Ivanova-Kazas’ theory. When the possible relationship of mouth and
stopore cannot be stated, the usual notation of the spiral cleavage cannot be applied.
