Comments to the Author(s)
This is an acceptable paper for publication in Royal Society Open Science. The manuscript
entitled " Variations in the glucosinolates of the individual edible parts of three stem mustards " is
an interesting and nice work. The manuscript reported the composition and content of
glucosinolates among the edible parts (petioles, peel, and flesh) of tuber mustard, bamboo shoots
mustard, and baby mustard. The results also well explained the relationships among the
preparation methods and the glucosinolate profiles of the three stem mustards, and this work
will provide a reference for the human daily diet.
However, some comments should be made to improve the manuscript. Below are some questions
and/or suggestions.
1) Line 18-19 on Page 2, as I know it is more than 200 kinds, please check it.
2) Line 30-43 on Page 7, what are the genetic relationships between the three mustards in this
manuscript and the species you are comparing? What caused different glucosinolate components
among them?
3) Line 19-32 on Page 8, this is a very interesting phenomenon. The kinds of aliphatic
glucosinolates are different among the three mustards, but the indolic glucosinolate kinds are
exactly the same among the three mustards. Why?
4) The English writing should be improved, and some mistakes exist in the manuscript, please
check and revise them carefully.
Line 43-45 on Page 1, Line 18-20 on Page 3, the sentences are difficult to understand, please
rewrite them.
Line 25 on Page 3, delete ‘a’
Line 44 on Page 4, change ‘obsereved’ to ‘observed’
Line 37 on Page 8, change ‘not only pickles’ to ‘is not only pickled’

iations in the glucosinolates of the individual edible parts of three stem mustards
tract
ge 1, Lines 48-56: The flow is not smooth. The key is sinigrin was the predominant
osinolate in all mustard investigated. I would suggest to show the relative amount of sinigrin
ach mustard rather than indole glucosinolate to show the most important information and
e the abstract little less lengthy.
oduction
ge 2, Line 20: Brassica is a more proper term instead of crucifers these days.
ge 2, Line 27: I would suggest to change “unique location” to “different cell, physically
arated from its substrate glucosinolates”.
ge 2, Line 52-53: The hydrolysis products of glucosinolates contribute to the pungent flavor,
glucosinolate itself.
erimental
ge 3, Line 13-14: ‘cultivar’ not ‘variety’. Change it throughout the manuscript.
ge 3, Line 21: What do you mean by ‘similar growing tendency’? Similar size? Please
ify.
ge 3, Line 23: What is your definition of “peel” and “flesh”? Glucosinolates can be
rolyzed during cutting and/or peeling process. Please provide more details on this step.
ge 3, sample prep and HPLC condition: At which step was internal standard added? What
the mobile phase condition? Was it 100% water and 100% acetonitrile? Was isocratic
em used or gradient system? How did you identify and quantify glucosinolates? Provide
e details.
ults
Glucosinolate composition in the mustard
ne 31: Italicize “Brassica”
is is a section about composition. Why don’t you provide % of important glucosinolates?
be aliphatic, indole and glucosinolates in each species? Or % of one or two most abundant
osinolates would also be helpful. It is mentioned later in discussion but this information
uld also be in result.
Total glucosinolates
ne 42: Delete “respectively”. This is not needed.
Indole glucosinolates
29: Change “obviously” to “significantly”.
Principal component analysis
A and PLS-DA are different. Therefore, it seems little odd to see the PLS-DA in PCA
tion. You need to change the title of this section.
hat compounds were most distinguishable by PLS-DA? You can use the VIP value and
ct a biomarker that were different among species or among tissues. Fig. 6C itself is not
dable that much and therefore you need to read in the text.
cussion
ge 7, Line 59-: “however, it is gluconapin in Chinese kale [18] and most varieties of B. rapa.
predominant glucosinolate in a few other varieties of B. rapa is glucobrassicanapin [24]” is
needed. These are different crop, different species from your materials and therefore, it is
aningless to directly compare like this. If you still want to cite these references (18 and 24),
hrase so that it flows better.
ge 8, Line 3: Change “cruciferous” to “Brassica”. Change it throughout the manuscript if
e are more.
ge 8, Line 31: “close” not “closely”
ge 8, Lines 46-52: On what ground do you say that tuber mustard requires the most
cessing, baby mustard requires less processing, and bamboo shoots mustard should be
en fresh? Is this because of sinigrin content? If so, this is irony because you say that AITC is
ctive against cancer and suggest to consume mustard daily.
o, you need to carefully check references. Are ITCs anti-cancer or anti-carcinogenic? Cancer
carcinogenesis are different process. Please don’t be confused or use the terms inter-
ngeably.
e 8, Lines 54-58: What is the ground of sugar masking pungent flavor? The total
osinolate content of 3 mustards is not compared in one figure. You need to show a stacked
graph showing aliphatic, indole and aromatic glucosinolates (one bar) in 3 mustards. And
n you need to discuss what causes more pungent flavor of tuber mustard than baby mustard
ough sinigrin content is not different.
u want to refer [13], higher amount of myrosinase in tuber mustard than in baby mustard,
can also check the myrosinase activity. Check Kim et al. (Cultivar-specific changes in
ary and secondary metabolites in pak choi (Brassica rapa, Chinensis group) by methyl
monate, 2017. Int. J. Mol. Sci.) and Frazie et al. (Health-Promoting Phytochemicals from 11
tard Cultivars at Baby Leaf and Mature Stages. 2017. Molecules) for more information.
ure 5: Delete the total aromatic glucosinolate figure. Since gluconasturtiin is the only
matic glucosinolate detected in this study, the total content figure is redundant.
ers
ustard can be either Brassice juncea or B. nigra. B. nigra is never mentioned in this article.
if you keep using “mustard” without clarifying the scientific name, it can confuse or mislead.
uld suggest to put “Brassice juncea” in the article title so that the readers know this article
focuses on B. juncea.
abstract, Page 3 Line 5, and Page 9 Line 29, what do you mean by “preparation method”?
is unclear.
s said that this article provides a reference for the human daily diet. But it doesn’t seem true.
ough how to consume each mustard is suggested, it cannot be seen as “a reference for the
an daily diet” especially on what ground you suggest that way is not clear.
roughout the manuscript, why you separated tissues is not shown. Therefore, the
ortance of the information in this manuscript is not strong enough. Please include this
rmation to justify this study.

Title: Variations in the glucosinolates of the individual edible parts of

Royal Society Open Science
Dear Professor Anthony Stace FRS
We are pleased to submit a revised version of the manuscript
label_version_2
RSOS-182054. We are truly grateful to reviewers’ critical comments
and thoughtful suggestions. We have worked through the details in the
comments of the reviewers, and revised the paper accordingly. We
hope the new manuscript will meet the standard of Royal Society Open
Science. Below you will find our point-by-point responses to the
reviewers’ comments/questions.
Thank you very much for your consideration.

Referees' Comments to Author:
Referee: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
1) Line 18-19 on Page 2, as I know it is more than 200 kinds, please
check it.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
2) Line 30-43 on Page 7, what are the genetic relationships between
the three mustards in this manuscript and the species you are
comparing? What caused different glucosinolate components among
them?
It is a very good suggestion. All of the species compared in our
manuscript are belong to Brassica. Cauliflower, cabbage, and
Chinese kale are three different variants of Brassica oleracea.
Korean leaf mustard (B. juncea var. integrifolia) and the three
stem mustard in our manuscript are different variants of B. juncea.
Glucosinolate is one of the most important secondary metabolites
in Brassica vegetables. However, the genes in different Brassica
vegetables changed after a long period of evolution, and the
biosynthesis of glucosinolates was affected by the evolution, which
caused the difference in glucosinolate components.
3) Line 19-32 on Page 8, this is a very interesting phenomenon. The
kinds of aliphatic glucosinolates are different among the three
mustards, but the indolic glucosinolate kinds are exactly the same
among the three mustards. Why?
It is a very good suggestion. The aliphatic glucosinolates generally
related with flavor, and the indole glucosinolates generally
contribute to the plant defense against pathogens and generalist
herbivores. Besides, aliphatic glucosinolates controlled by genetic
factors, and indole glucosinolates major influenced by
environment. Different vegetables are different in flavor, however
indole glucosinolates maybe indispensable in plants. Therefore, the
composition of aliphatic glucosinolates in the three stem mustard
varied greatly, and the composition of indole glucosinolates is
similar.
4) The English writing should be improved, and some mistakes exist in
the manuscript, please check and revise them carefully.
Line 43-45 on Page 1, Line 18-20 on Page 3, the sentences are difficult
to understand, please rewrite them.
Line 25 on Page 3, delete ‘a’
Line 44 on Page 4, change ‘obsereved’ to ‘observed’
Line 37 on Page 8, change ‘not only pickles’ to ‘is not only pickled’
Thanks for your suggestion. We have carefully checked and
revised the manuscript to improve the English expression by
ourselves, and then the manuscript was also critically read by Dr.
Yunting Zhang (University of California, Davis).

Comments to the Author(s)
Abstract
1). - Page 1, Lines 48-56: The flow is not smooth. The key is sinigrin
was the predominant glucosinolate in all mustard investigated. I would
suggest to show the relative amount of sinigrin in each mustard rather
than indole glucosinolate to show the most important information and
make the abstract little less lengthy.
Thanks for your suggestion. We supplemented the relative content
of sinigrin in results, and the content about indole glucosinolates
was removed from the abstract according to the recommendations.
Introduction
1) - Page 2, Line 20: Brassica is a more proper term instead of
crucifers these days.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised them in the
manuscript.
2) - Page 2, Line 27: I would suggest to change “unique location” to
“different cell, physically separated from its substrate glucosinolates”.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
3) - Page 2, Line 52-53: The hydrolysis products of glucosinolates
contribute to the pungent flavor, not glucosinolate itself.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
Experimental
1) - Page 3, Line 13-14: ‘cultivar’ not ‘variety’. Change it throughout
the manuscript.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised them in the
manuscript.
2) - Page 3, Line 21: What do you mean by ‘similar growing tendency’?
Similar size? Please clarify.
Thanks for your suggestion. Our previous description is
inaccurate, and our meaning is the similar size. The details have
been modified in the manuscript.
3) - Page 3, Line 23: What is your definition of “peel” and “flesh”?
Glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed during cutting and/or peeling
process. Please provide more details on this step.
Thanks for your suggestion. All of the three mustards have a clear
dividing line between peel and flesh. We sampled according to the
dividing line. Glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed easily just as you
said. After sampling, we quickly froze the samples in liquid
nitrogen, then store them at -80 °C, and finally lyophilized them.
The details have been added to the manuscript.
4) - Page 3, sample prep and HPLC condition: At which step was
internal standard added? What was the mobile phase condition? Was it
100% water and 100% acetonitrile? Was isocratic system used or
gradient system? How did you identify and quantify glucosinolates?
Provide more details.
Thanks for your suggestion. The internal standard added to
supernatant after centrifugation. The mobile phase was 100%
water and 100% acetonitrile, and the gradient system was used in
our experiment. The glucosinolates were identified by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS), and quantified by
a standard curve. More details have been added to the manuscript.
Results
3.1. Glucosinolate composition in the mustard
1) - Line 31: Italicize “Brassica”
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
2) - This is a section about composition. Why don’t you provide % of
important glucosinolates? Maybe aliphatic, indole and glucosinolates
in each species? Or % of one or two most abundant glucosinolates
would also be helpful. It is mentioned later in discussion but this
information should also be in result.
Thanks for your suggestion. The proportions of sinigrin have been
added to the manuscript. .
3.2. Total glucosinolates
1) - Line 42: Delete “respectively”. This is not needed.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
3.4. Indole glucosinolates
1) - Line 29: Change “obviously” to “significantly”.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
3.6. Principal component analysis
1) - PCA and PLS-DA are different. Therefore, it seems little odd to
see the PLS-DA in PCA section. You need to change the title of this
section.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
2) - What compounds were most distinguishable by PLS-DA? You can
use the VIP value and select a biomarker that were different among
species or among tissues. Fig. 6C itself is not readable that much and
therefore you need to read in the text.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript,
and Fig 6C has been explained in the title of Fig. 6.
Discussion
1) - Page 7, Line 59-: “however, it is gluconapin in Chinese kale [18]
and most varieties of B. rapa. The predominant glucosinolate in a few
other varieties of B. rapa is glucobrassicanapin [24]” is not needed.
These are different crop, different species from your materials and
therefore, it is meaningless to directly compare like this. If you still
want to cite these references (18 and 24), re-phrase so that it flows
better.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the discussion.
2) - Page 8, Line 3: Change “cruciferous” to “Brassica”. Change it
throughout the manuscript if there are more.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised them in the
manuscript.
3) - Page 8, Line 31: “close” not “closely”
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
4) - Page 8, Lines 46-52: On what ground do you say that tuber
mustard requires the most processing, baby mustard requires less
processing, and bamboo shoots mustard should be eaten fresh? Is this
because of sinigrin content? If so, this is irony because you say that
AITC is effective against cancer and suggest to consume mustard
daily.
Thanks for your suggestion. A high content of sinigrin is effective
against cancer, but it tastes bad. Taste is the most important in
the consumption of vegetables. Besides, the custom of processing
already exists in life. We just explained the relationship between
the content of glucosinolates and the custom of processing.
5) Also, you need to carefully check references. Are ITCs anti-cancer
or anti-carcinogenic? Cancer and carcinogenesis are different process.
Please don’t be confused or use the terms inter-changeably.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
6) Page 8, Lines 54-58: What is the ground of sugar masking pungent
flavor? The total glucosinolate content of 3 mustards is not compared
in one figure. You need to show a stacked bar graph showing aliphatic,
indole and aromatic glucosinolates (one bar) in 3 mustards. And then
you need to discuss what causes more pungent flavor of tuber mustard
than baby mustard although sinigrin content is not different. If you
want to refer [13], higher amount of myrosinase in tuber mustard than
in baby mustard, you can also check the myrosinase activity. Check
Kim et al. (Cultivar-specific changes in primary and secondary
metabolites in pak choi (Brassica rapa, Chinensis group) by methyl
jasmonate, 2017. Int. J. Mol. Sci.) and Frazie et al. (Health-Promoting
Phytochemicals from 11 Mustard Cultivars at Baby Leaf and Mature
Stages. 2017. Molecules) for more information.
<U+2460> Thanks for your suggestion. The presumption is based on life
experience.
<U+2461> It is a good suggestion. We have added the stacked bar graph
in Supplemental Figure 1 as follow.
Supplemental Fig. 1 The concentration and proportion of individual
glucosinolates in different tissues of the three stem mustards. A:
glucosinolate concentration. B: proportion.
<U+2462> The papers suggested in your comment are very important. We
have added them to the references after carefully reading.
7) Figure 5: Delete the total aromatic glucosinolate figure. Since
gluconasturtiin is the only aromatic glucosinolate detected in this study,
the total content figure is redundant.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
Others
1) - Mustard can be either Brassice juncea or B. nigra. B. nigra is
never mentioned in this article. And if you keep using “mustard”
without clarifying the scientific name, it can confuse or mislead. I
would suggest to put “Brassice juncea” in the article title so that the
readers know this article only focuses on B. juncea.
It is an excellent suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
2) - In abstract, Page 3 Line 5, and Page 9 Line 29, what do you mean
by “preparation method”? This is unclear.
Thanks for your suggestion. In order to express it more clearly, the
“preparation” has been changed to “cooking”.
3) - It is said that this article provides a reference for the human daily
diet. But it doesn’t seem true. Although how to consume each mustard
is suggested, it cannot be seen as “a reference for the human daily diet”
especially on what ground you suggest that way is not clear.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised it in the manuscript.
4) - Throughout the manuscript, why you separated tissues is not
shown. Therefore, the importance of the information in this manuscript
is not strong enough. Please include this information to justify this
study.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have added the reason in the
introduction.
