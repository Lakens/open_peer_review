1. Figs. 1-3 are all drawn cartoons that are hard/impossible to be substantiated. The only exp.
data are in Fig. 4. Authors did not indicate what Tc was used to produce the POM micrograph for
PHB? What was the Tc in this crystallized? In addition, the specimens do not appear to be
uniform. In addition to this only “big” spherulites, there are many other smaller, and non-
banded, spherulites that surround this big one. From the scale as stated (130 um for diameter,
this referee calculated that the band spacing = ca. 130/12 = 11 um.
2. The photo in Fig. 3 to illustrate “helical lamella”. The photo appears to be taken on a piece of
cloth ribbon placed on a table and authors coiled it into a helix for taking a picture. This referee
does not understand what a piece of cloth ribbon, artificially coiled and placed on table can prove
anything in science? Did authors attempt to use photo of a piece of cloth, along with a crudely
performed and artifact-filled POM photo, to advance the understanding of the complex banding
issues that have been already debated and analyzed with all advanced instrument?
3. Ring bands and twisting have been addressed by thousands of previous papers. The whole
work in this submission is superficial and filled with speculations, and unsound experimental
data from a very rough and crude POM characterization (the exp. Data fig. 4, a very simple POM
micrograph). If author cannot prove there is a relation between the hand-made cloth ribbon and
the POM banded spherulites, this referee does not see any merits of this work?
4. Authors presented an only experimental data (POM) in this work (the other two are cartoons) -
Polarized light micrograph (crossed polarizers) of a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) banded spherulite.
Not only POM characterization was crudely performed (non-uniform films, with aggregated

Appendix A
Dear editor, thank you for the opportunity to resubmit the manuscript. Please, be
aware that I have taken into account all reviewers comments and amended the
manuscript conformably, namely:
<U+F0D8> I have specify the number of crystallized specimens and their thickness.
<U+F0D8> I have added more images of banded spherulites (see new fig. 5), discussing
the differences and similarities among banded and non-banded spherulites,
observed either under linearly and circularly polarized light.
<U+F0D8> I have illustrated in the new fig.4 the theoretical appearance of twisted and
non-twisted spherulites, and explained how to make the comparison with true
spherulites.
<U+F0D8> Moreover, below I have replayed point by point to comments of the referees.
Replay to Reviewer 1
1. Figs. 1, 2 and 3 illustrate principles of the consolidated theory of torsion. I
think they are necessary to draw the attention of readers on the helical
geometry of fibers of a twisted body. In particular, these figures show
immediately mathematical properties of helices and their connections with
optical properties of helical crystals. Therefore, I have preserved them in the
resubmitted manuscript.
I wish to specify that the aim of the present work is not to study the
crystallization behavior of PHB, (which has been deeply and exhaustively
investigated in the past, together to the variables affecting band spacing, see
for instance M. Raimo et. Al. J Mat Sci (2000) 35: 523-545 or P.J. Barham
et al., J Mat Sci 1984, 19:2781-2794) nor to deny the possibility of crystal
twisting, but to provide a qualitative test to reveal twisted spherulites. In
order to avoid banding produced by rhythmic crystallization, which would
mask or hinder twisting, thermal degradation of PHB has been minimized
with the adoption of a fast non-isothermal crystallization procedure. It is well
known that with this kind of procedure thermal nucleation occurs and,
therefore, a wide distribution of spherulites size arises. Several spherulites,
however, nucleate at lower temperatures, resulting smaller.
2. and 3. The ribbon in fig.3 provides a geometrical model of a helix, does not
claim to prove anything else than mathematical properties of helices. I have
nothing against advanced instruments, but I simply recognize that even the
most sophisticated instrument can produce artifacts and often questionable
results. On the other hand, optical microscopy is an old but still powerful and
trustworthy technique to be abandoned. Please, be aware that I do respect the
work of all people but, as a researcher, I have to respect first of all facts,
trying to verify if they are explainable within the framework of existing
theories. That is what I have done in the present manuscript: I repeat that,
although I have not be able to observe twisted spherulites, the aim of my
work is not to deny crystal twisting but to make anyone able to verify
twisting by means of a simple and widely available test.
4. Please note that in the resubmitted manuscript I have added more
experimental details on the number of crystallized samples, their thickness,
and also explained in the text the presence of spherulites of very different
size. Moreover, I am not the only one to have observed intermittent crests
and depressions onto the surface of banded spherulites: a huge number of
authors, independently on their explanation of banding, have shown the
presence of circular depressions within spherulites. Obviously, I could quote
only a small number of these papers (see references 26-28 in the manuscript).
5. Small spherulites nucleated at temperatures lower than those of larger
spherulites, so that pauses for heat removal from the growth front may be
proportionally reduced, and may be even not appreciable at all. Please note
that banding is often more evident in the core of spherulites rather than at the
borders.
Replay to Reviewer 2
Please, note that I have added several more spherulite images, also under circularly
polarized light, discussing differences and similarities between them. Beyond to
mention the reduced birefringence of twisted crystals, I have also clearly show the
theoretical appearance of helical crystals in polarized light with a full wave plate. I
have also illustrated in the new Fig. 4 the qualitative test to distinguish twisted and
untwisted spherulites.

ar editor and Reviewers, thank you for the opportunity to revise the manuscript. Please, be aware
I have taken into account all reviewers comments and amended the manuscript conformably,
ely:
<U+F0D8> I have provided to referee to Reviewer 3 all the comments of both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer
2, that are reported at the end, together to my replay and the list of the amendments made
before resubmission.
<U+F0D8> To take in account the comments of Reviewer 4, I have better specify in the manuscript
(underlined text pp.5-6) that the proposed test constitutes a preliminary examination to
evaluate the convenience and the type of further investigations on the origin of banding in
spherulites, and that the test is especially useful as a headlight for the choice of the most
appropriate experimental procedures. I have also added two new references (24 and 28) and
changed the title of the manuscript in: “An optical test to unveil twisting of birefringent
crystals in spherulites”
<U+F0D8> Here is my replay to the judgement of Reviewer 4.
I absolutely agree with Reviewer 4 that the test proposed in my manuscript does not
unambiguously prove crystal twisting in spherulites and that twisting must be confirmed
with further inquiries. Indeed, a reduction of birefringence is also observed in the so-called
mixed spherulites with a random orientation of the optical axis. Moreover, banding is not
confined to twisting structures, since it has also been connected to rhythmic crystallization
in several studies and by a huge number of authors. Therefore, any explanation of the origin
of banding in a spherulite has to answer the following questions: is banding due to helical
structures or to rhythmic crystallization, and in the former case helices are constituted of
polymer chains or, as a part of polymer literature seems to suggest, of elongated crystals?
The merit of my test is that it can confirm or exclude crystal twisting, leaving in the latter
case to further investigations the explanation of the origin of banding. Please, note also that,
for readers’ convenience, I have indicated in the text the main reasons of banding together
to references that allow to prove the true cause of banding.
Reviewer 4 also complains about the scarceness of experimental work. But, I repeat, my test
consists advisedly in visual observations, discussed in the framework of the well-established
birefringence and torsion theories. As also pointed out by Reviewer 1, many other
techniques and procedures have been utilized by several investigators, so it is unnecessary to
repeat their work. Please note also that, according to the birefringence theory, the first clue
of cooperative crystal twisting is the absence of a dark cross in spherulites, whereas banded
spherulites usually show an inner Maltese cross under linearly polarized light.
Finally, as I already told to Reviewer 1, fig.1 and fig.2 illustrate concepts of the torsion
theory, whereas fig.3 provides only a geometrical model of a helix, and they do not claim to
prove anything else than physico-mathematical properties of helices. Evidences of twisting
of crystals must be obviously inferred from optical appearance or other physical properties
of spherulites
Yours faithfully
Maria Raimo

Comments to the Author(s)
Review comments:
1. Figs. 1-3 are all drawn cartoons that are hard/impossible to be substantiated. The only
exp. data are in Fig. 4. Authors did not indicate what Tc was used to produce the POM
micrograph for PHB? What was the Tc in this crystallized? In addition, the specimens do
not appear to be uniform. In addition to this only “big” spherulites, there are many other
smaller, and non-banded, spherulites that surround this big one. From the scale as
stated (130 um for diameter, this referee calculated that the band spacing = ca. 130/12
= 11 um.
2. The photo in Fig. 3 to illustrate “helical lamella”. The photo appears to be taken on a
piece of cloth ribbon placed on a table and authors coiled it into a helix for taking a
picture. This referee does not understand what a piece of cloth ribbon, artificially coiled
and placed on table can prove anything in science? Did authors attempt to use photo of a
piece of cloth, along with a crudely performed and artifact-filled POM photo, to advance
the understanding of the complex banding issues that have been already debated and
analyzed with all advanced instrument?
3. Ring bands and twisting have been addressed by thousands of previous papers. The
whole work in this submission is superficial and filled with speculations, and unsound
experimental data from a very rough and crude POM characterization (the exp. Data fig.
4, a very simple POM micrograph). If author cannot prove there is a relation between the
hand-made cloth ribbon and the POM banded spherulites, this referee does not see any

4. Authors presented an only experimental data (POM) in this work (the other two are
cartoons) - Polarized light micrograph (crossed polarizers) of a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)
banded spherulite. Not only POM characterization was crudely performed (non-uniform
films, with aggregated spherulites), but also the temperature of crystallization was not
indicated. Authors did not measure or indicate what “thickness” was this film? Nor did
they say where is the “thickness oscillation”? How do authors explain the phenomenon
that there are not only a banded spherulite but also many non-banded PHB spherulites all
jammed in films of aggregated domains, where the film thickness appeared to be same
for all spherulites?
5. Authors then concluded that “Banding is attributed likely to the oscillation of the
thickness along the radii of the spherulite. Regardless author considered whether
“twisting” is at work to be responsible for banding or not, why in the same specimens,
there are tens or hundred other spherulites (neighboring this big one) that do not show
bands, and only this big spherulite shows bands of spacing = 11-12 um?

have observed intermittent crests and depressions onto the surface of banded
spherulites: a huge number of authors, independently on their explanation of banding,
have shown the presence of circular depressions within spherulites. Obviously, I could
quote only a small number of these papers (see references 26-28 in the manuscript).
5. Small spherulites nucleated at temperatures lower than those of larger spherulites, so
that pauses for heat removal from the growth front may be proportionally reduced,
and may be even not appreciable at all. Please note that banding is often more evident
in the core of spherulites rather than at the borders.
Replay to Reviewer 2
Please, note that I have added several more spherulite images, also under circularly polarized
light, discussing differences and similarities between them. Beyond to mention the reduced
birefringence of twisted crystals, I have also clearly show the theoretical appearance of helical
crystals in polarized light with a full wave plate. I have also illustrated in the new Fig. 4 the
qualitative test to distinguish twisted and untwisted spherulites.
