This is an interesting paper. Aims are original and clear, so are methods and results and
discussion is thorough.
I have some comments and suggestions though.
1. To improve readability I suggest to shorten the methods. For example, sentences like “we
subsequently checked whether subjects understood the information…” or “(executive/non
executive/no profession….)” can be deleted without subtracting important information and
making it easier to follow the paper.
An analogous consideration can be done for the long premise in the Result section in the Imaging
part (“according to the analysis outlined…” )
2. In the results some data are replicated. I suggest that data referring only to the patients are
reported only in the text and data comparing patients and controls are reported only in the table.
Whatever the choice, data have to be reported once as duplicates worsen readability.
3. In the discussion section I don’t think that the sentence, “ In fact , there is evidence that
neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease can shift the time preference for rewards”,
formulated as such, is pertinent.
4. The abstract does not mention the imaging part in the design of the study and results. I
suppose this is an involuntary omission.
Finally I did not understand whether the computer-generated strategy of “player 2” is designed
to defect rather than cooperate, thus pushing the subject to change strategy shifting towards
defecting over time.

This is a well written, clearly presented study looking at the differences between people with
frontal lobe epilepsy and healthy controls on a prisoner’s dilemma task, and the ways in which
their responses have an impact on medication compliance. This is an important area of study and
the study presents an innovation way of looking at this, with the added potential of clinically
relevant findings.
It has a number of limitations, common to all studies of clinical populations, not least the
difficulties in accurately measuring compliance with treatment. These are acknowledged by the
authors However there are two larger methodological shortcomings that significantly limit the
conclusions that can be drawn from the data.
Firstly, no epilepsy control group was used. It is therefore unclear whether the study findings
represent FLE or the impact of epilepsy in general or indeed antiepileptic medications. This is
particularly important given the counterintuitive results which indicate that people with FLE
cooperate more than controls – could this be due to the social impact of living with a challenging,
stigmatising condition? Is this behaviour more common in all people with epilepsy?
Secondly post operative patients appear to have been included in the FLE group, These patients
will obviously have very different fMRI activations than non-surgical samples and there is
increasing evidence in the fMRI literature that surgery changes patterns of activation. This adds
yet another important confounding variable in this already small sample.

label_comment_4
Many thanks for the opportunity to review this paper. The authors analysed a sample of 15
patients with frontal lobe epilepsy and 15 healthy controls using neuropsychometry, social
cognition testing and an fMRI dilemma game task. Patients exhibited altered activation of the
prefrontal cortex, which related to performance in social cognition tests as well as compliance
with anti-epileptic drug therapy.
The paper is novel, very interesting, and significantly adds to the literature of social cognition in
epilepsy. It will definitely be of interest to the readership of Royal Society Open Science.

I have a number of observations as follows — though most are minor, please note that there are
some major concerns regarding the statistical analysis of imaging data, which should be
addressed thoroughly.
Abstract
Could the authors specify the number of subjects analysed in the abstract already?
Methods
1. “Subjects” section — could the authors be more specific as to what was the cut-off for ‘frontal
lobe lesions affecting large cortical areas’ to grant exclusion of a participant?
2. “Paradigm” section, second line”: please change “insure” with “ensure”.
3. Regarding the cognitive abilities tested by the Trail Making Test A and B-A, the authors should
be more specific, as the latter does not merely assess attention. TMT B-A is a measure of ’mental
flexibility’, which is an executive function, whereas TMT-A more appropriately relates to
psychomotor speed. This denominations, consequently, should be adopted in the subsequent
manuscript sections too.
Results
1. In line with suggestions of previous reviewer, I would recommend further streamlining of the
main text. For instance, in the “Behavioural data, neuropsychological variables and
questionnaires” section of the manuscript, all z scores and p values for group comparisons could
be moved to Table 2. This would also enhance the interpretability of the results reported in the
table.
2. When describing first-level imaging data analysis, the authors should specify the type of
analysis done (supposedly event-related fMRI) for the convenience of the reader.
3. It would be helpful to provide a figure from a one-sample showing the main effects of task
across study groups, thus highlighting the task-associated whole-brain activation map (i.e., an
image related to the findings detailed in Table 3).
4. I have concerns on how imaging results were reported with regards to group comparisons. In a
2x2 factorial SPM design, the ‘Main effect’ of group contrast is helpful to identify areas of group
differences in either direction (FLE > CTR or FLE < CTR), is associated with an F statistic, but
does not provide information regarding the directionality of effects. The latter is provided by t-
contrasts, which are not reported in the manuscript (there are only F-scores in Table 5). How can
the authors conclude that activation of the superior frontal gyrus is higher in patients (and not
lower), when this was not formally tested? This is a relevant shortcoming and has to be
addressed. Appropriate t-contrasts need be carried out both for whole-brain and ROI-based
group comparisons.
5. Linked with the above comment — Figure 3 (group comparisons) should be re-done according
to what group comparisons actually show.
6. Always with regards to group comparisons — can the authors confirm that, in the batch
system, the following parameter were chosen for the factorial design: (a) Group - Independence:
“Yes”, but (b) for Condition (decision/result) —> Independence should be set to “No” — as this
is a case of repeated measures design.
7. I find the description of the correlation between imaging and behavioural measures a bit
confusing. First, it is unclear to me what BOLD % signal change the authors are referring to —
was it for the ‘decision’, for the ‘result’ condition, or for an average of both? Second, the whole
phrasing of ‘activation change’ is misleading — either ‘signal change’ or ‘activation/deactivation’
should be used to refer to a change in % BOLD, activation change presumes that there’s a
dynamic process taking place during the task, which is not the case here.
9
Discussion
1. Depending on the actual directionality of the group contrast as discussed in the above
comment, the whole section addressing imaging findings (page 13, second paragraph, continuing
on the following page) may need to be reformulated
2. In the last paragraph, it would be helpful to put the findings in a broader context, e.g. by
mentioning briefly the current state of the art re: social cognition impairment in other epilepsy
syndromes with frontal lobe dysfunction, such as JME/IGE (see Giorgi et al., Epilepsy Research
2016; Stewart et al., Seizure 2018).

Please accept our apologies for the unusual delay in completing the review of your manuscript:
unfortunately, one of the original reviewers for your paper was not available, and we struggled
to find an alternative referee to assess the revision. We have now received comments from an
additional reviewer, who has a number of comments that we'd like you to address -- as a number
of their concerns are major, we're offering a final opportunity of revision to resolve these
problems (ordinarily, authors are entitled to one round of may revisions only). You should be
aware that, if you're not able to persuade the reviewer that the manuscript is ready for
acceptance, we will not be able to consider the paper further. We wish you success, and look
forward to reading the revision in due course.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
Many thanks for the opportunity to re-review this paper.
I am generally satisfied as to how the authors addressed my previous comments, and I appreciate
the restructuring of the discussion.
A few minor points:
1. For the newly added Figure 3: it would be appreciated if, in the figure legend, the authors
could confirm whether the shown activation maps were thresholded at p<0.001, uncorrected (in
line, I presume, with what specified in the “Imaging data” paragraph of the Data Analysis
section). For consistency, this piece of information should also be added to the legend of Figure 4.
2. In the main text and figure legend, “one group t test” should be changed to “one sample t test”.
3. When discussing the full factorial analysis (results section named: “Integrated comparison
across groups and conditions”, before region of interest analysis): the authors should specify,
after “the main group effect”, that this was an F-test, to enhance clarity. Such clarification can
easily go in brackets.
4. In their response to my point 4 of the Results section, the authors state that additional t test
analyses were conducted as requested, both for whole-brain and at a ROI level, and that the latter
showed no significant group differences.
However, in the paragraph named “Region of interest analysis” of the Imaging results section
(page 10), the first sentence states “ROI-analysis also showed areas of higher activation in patients
than in controls in the right and left superior frontal gyrus”. This appears in contrast with what
the authors state in their response – could the authors clarify? It should be amended to reflect the
fact that there were no significant group differences, I believe.

5. Discussion, 3 line from the beginning – guess the authors mean “shed light” instead of “shade
light” ?

Comments to the Author(s)
Many thanks for the opportunity to re-review this paper.
I am generally satisfied as to how the authors addressed my previous comments, and I appreciate
the restructuring of the discussion.
A few minor points:
1. For the newly added Figure 3: it would be appreciated if, in the figure legend, the authors
could confirm whether the shown activation maps were thresholded at p<0.001, uncorrected (in
line, I presume, with what specified in the “Imaging data” paragraph of the Data Analysis
section). For consistency, this piece of information should also be added to the legend of Figure 4.
2. In the main text and figure legend, “one group t test” should be changed to “one sample t test”.
3. When discussing the full factorial analysis (results section named: “Integrated comparison
across groups and conditions”, before region of interest analysis): the authors should specify,
after “the main group effect”, that this was an F-test, to enhance clarity. Such clarification can
easily go in brackets.
4. In their response to my point 4 of the Results section, the authors state that additional t test
analyses were conducted as requested, both for whole-brain and at a ROI level, and that the latter
showed no significant group differences.
17
However, in the paragraph named “Region of interest analysis” of the Imaging results section
(page 10), the first sentence states “ROI-analysis also showed areas of higher activation in patients
than in controls in the right and left superior frontal gyrus”. This appears in contrast with what
the authors state in their response – could the authors clarify? It should be amended to reflect the
fact that there were no significant group differences, I believe.
5. Discussion, 3 line from the beginning – guess the authors mean “shed light” instead of “shade
light” ?

Dear Prof Hamilton, dear Dr Christakou,
Please find enclosed a revision of the manuscript (RSOS-180850) “Social cognition,
behaviour, and therapy adherence in frontal lobe epilepsy: A study combining neuroeconomic
and neuropsychological methods”.
Below I have pasted the original reviewer comments and added our point-by-point responses
marked in boldface).
We would like to thank the reviewers for their excellent comments on the previous draft. This
version of the manuscript has benefited greatly from these comments, and we hope that it is
now acceptable for publication.
Sincerely,

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting paper. Aims are original and clear, so are methods and results and
discussion is thorough.
Thank you for your positive overall remarks.
have some comments and suggestions though.
1. To improve readability I suggest to shorten the methods. For example, sentences like
“we subsequently checked whether subjects understood the information…” or
“(executive/non executive/no profession….)” can be deleted without subtracting important
nformation and making it easier to follow the paper. An analogous consideration can be done
or the long premise in the Result section in the Imaging part (“according to the analysis
outlined…” )
We have shortened the method and results sections as suggested in order to improve
readability.
2. In the results some data are replicated. I suggest that data referring only to the patients
are reported only in the text and data comparing patients and controls are reported only in the
able. Whatever the choice, data have to be reported once as duplicates worsen readability.
We have changed the results section as well as table 2 as proposed. Thank you for this
comment.
3. In the discussion section I don’t think that the sentence, “ In fact , there is evidence
hat neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease can shift the time preference for rewards”,
ormulated as such, is pertinent.
We have changed this sentence in a way to reflect that the preference for rewards in
neurological disorders is not yet understood and evidence is scarce, but that a disease
driven change might be possible as reported by the reference publication.
4. The abstract does not mention the imaging part in the design of the study and results. I
suppose this is an involuntary omission.
Thank you for highlighting this. We have changed the abstract to make clear that fMRI
methodology was used and have included the main result of our imaging analysis
difference in activation of the medial prefrontal cortex between patient and control
groups).
Finally I did not understand whether the computer-generated strategy of “player 2” is
designed to defect rather than cooperate, thus pushing the subject to change strategy shifting
owards defecting over time.
Thank you for pointing out the need to clarify this. In the revised manuscript, we now
make clear that the computerized counterpart of the participants was randomly
cooperating or defecting, thus was not specifically designed to shift the participants’
strategy.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a well written, clearly presented study looking at the differences between people with
rontal lobe epilepsy and healthy controls on a prisoner’s dilemma task, and the ways in
which their responses have an impact on medication compliance. This is an important area of
study and the study presents an innovation way of looking at this, with the added potential of
clinically relevant findings.
Thank you for your encouraging remarks.
t has a number of limitations, common to all studies of clinical populations, not least the
difficulties in accurately measuring compliance with treatment. These are acknowledged by
he authors. However there are two larger methodological shortcomings that significantly
imit the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.
Firstly, no epilepsy control group was used. It is therefore unclear whether the study findings
epresent FLE or the impact of epilepsy in general or indeed antiepileptic medications. This is
particularly important given the counterintuitive results which indicate that people with FLE
cooperate more than controls – could this be due to the social impact of living with a
challenging, stigmatising condition? Is this behaviour more common in all people with
epilepsy?
We have added a paragraph on this limitation at the end of the discussion section of the
manuscript.
Secondly post operative patients appear to have been included in the FLE group, These
patients will obviously have very different fMRI activations than non-surgical samples and
here is increasing evidence in the fMRI literature that surgery changes patterns of activation.
This adds yet another important confounding variable in this already small sample.
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to clarify. In fact, past brain surgery was an
exclusion criterion for participation in our study, as we wanted to prevent this being a
confounder. We have added a sentence in the method section after our exclusion criteria
o clarify this more prominently in the manuscript. Further, we now describe the
ncluded patients more precisely in the modified first paragraph of the results section in
order to avoid misunderstandings.
Additional changes:
According to journal guidelines, we have moved the ethics statement from the methods
section to a separate section after the conclusions.
The competing interests section has also been moved according to journal guidelines.

paper is novel, very interesting, and significantly adds to the literature of social cognition in

ONSE: Thank you for your positive remarks and your valuable comments to improve the
lity of the paper.
ve a number of observations as follows — though most are minor, please note that there are some
or concerns regarding the statistical analysis of imaging data, which should be addressed
oughly.
tract
ld the authors specify the number of subjects analysed in the abstract already?
PONSE: We have integrated the sample size within the abstract.
hods
Subjects” section — could the authors be more specific as to what was the cut-off for ‘frontal lobe
ns affecting large cortical areas’ to grant exclusion of a participant?
PONSE: We have reworded this sentence to improve clarity. The new sentence is:
ntal cortical lesions larger than 1 cm in diameter”.
Paradigm” section, second line”: please change “insure” with “ensure”.
PONSE: Thank you very much for pointing out this spelling error. This has been adapted.
egarding the cognitive abilities tested by the Trail Making Test A and B-A, the authors should be
e specific, as the latter does not merely assess attention. TMT B-A is a measure of ’mental
bility’, which is an executive function, whereas TMT-A more appropriately relates to psychomotor
ed. This denominations, consequently, should be adopted in the subsequent manuscript sections
PONSE: We have adapted the description of the Trail Making Tests A and B accordingly
oth methods and subsequent sections.
ults
n line with suggestions of previous reviewer, I would recommend further streamlining of the main
. For instance, in the “Behavioural data, neuropsychological variables and questionnaires” section
he manuscript, all z scores and p values for group comparisons could be moved to Table 2. This
ld also enhance the interpretability of the results reported in the table.
PONSE: We have shifted the mentioned data concerning group comparisons into Table 2
only left information on clinical variables including treatment adherence questionnaires
correlation analyses in the text as Table 2 focuses on demographic, neuropsychological,
neuroeconomic data. Consequently, there is no duplicate data reporting between text
tables in the revised manuscript. This change has also resulted in a modification of the
end of Table 2.
hen describing first-level imaging data analysis, the authors should specify the type of analysis
e (supposedly event-related fMRI) for the convenience of the reader.
PONSE: We have added the type of analysis (event-related fMRI analysis) to the text.
would be helpful to provide a figure from a one-sample showing the main effects of task across
y groups, thus highlighting the task-associated whole-brain activation map (i.e., an image related
he findings detailed in Table 3).
ONSE: We have added a new figure (Figure 3) to illustrate the findings detailed in Table
e took this opportunity to adapted Table 3 and the corresponding text in the results
tion to match the analysis type of the other tables. Subsequently, the numeration of the
res has changed slightly (original Figure 3 is now Figure 4).
have concerns on how imaging results were reported with regards to group comparisons. In a 2x2
orial SPM design, the ‘Main effect’ of group contrast is helpful to identify areas of group differences
ther direction (FLE > CTR or FLE < CTR), is associated with an F statistic, but does not provide
rmation regarding the directionality of effects. The latter is provided by t-contrasts, which are not
rted in the manuscript (there are only F-scores in Table 5). How can the authors conclude that
vation of the superior frontal gyrus is higher in patients (and not lower), when this was not
ally tested? This is a relevant shortcoming and has to be addressed. Appropriate t-contrasts need
carried out both for whole-brain and ROI-based group comparisons.
ONSE: Thank you for pointing out the need for clarification here. We agree to the fact
t an F statistic does not offer information on directionality and we have changed the
ding in the results section accordingly. We have done additional t-test analyses on both
ditions (choice and results) on a whole-brain and ROI level as proposed. This has been
e with and without including other variables that differ significantly between groups as
ariates. These analyses did not yield any significant results. In our view, this shows that
the difference between groups shown in the F-contrast (main effect of groups) cannot
explained by a difference in one or the other condition in our sample, but is based on a
erence across both conditions, (2) the difference in activation between the groups is not
ot sufficiently strong to pass the set threshold in the t-test analyses, and/or (3) might
a result of insufficient sample size. We have adapted the paper in the methods, results,
discussion sections to reflect this thinking and potential limitation of our results.
inked with the above comment — Figure 3 (group comparisons) should be re-done according to
t group comparisons actually show.
ONSE: Due to the results of the t-test analyses depicted above, we have kept our
inal Figure 3 (now called Figure 4) in the revised manuscript.
lways with regards to group comparisons — can the authors confirm that, in the batch system, the
wing parameter were chosen for the factorial design: (a) Group - Independence: “Yes”, but (b)
Condition (decision/result) —> Independence should be set to “No” — as this is a case of repeated
sures design.
PONSE: We are happy to confirm the following parameters of our analysis:
ible factorial design with 3 factors:
ubject, independence (yes), variance (equal);
roup, independence (yes), variance (unequal);
ondition, independence (no), variance (equal).
main effects & interactions: main effects (1,2,3) and interaction (2,3).
find the description of the correlation between imaging and behavioural measures a bit confusing.
, it is unclear to me what BOLD % signal change the authors are referring to — was it for the
ision’, for the ‘result’ condition, or for an average of both? Second, the whole phrasing of
vation change’ is misleading — either ‘signal change’ or ‘activation/deactivation’ should be used to
r to a change in % BOLD, activation change presumes that there’s a dynamic process taking place
ng the task, which is not the case here.
ONSE: Thank you again for giving us the opportunity to clarify this section. We have
anced the language to make clear to what condition the reported BOLD% signal
nges are referring to in each sentence of this paragraph. Further, we have changed the
m ‘activation change’ to ‘signal change’ as proposed.
ussion
epending on the actual directionality of the group contrast as discussed in the above comment,
whole section addressing imaging findings (page 13, second paragraph, continuing on the
wing page) may need to be reformulated
PONSE: We have changed this section to reflect the results of our t-test analyses
icted in our response to reviewer comment 4 concerning our results above.
n the last paragraph, it would be helpful to put the findings in a broader context, e.g. by
tioning briefly the current state of the art re: social cognition impairment in other epilepsy
dromes with frontal lobe dysfunction, such as JME/IGE (see Giorgi et al., Epilepsy Research 2016;
wart et al., Seizure 2018).
ONSE: Thank you for pointing out the need to put our results into context. We have
ed information on Giorgi et al, 2016 and Stewart et al, 2018 in the last paragraph.
