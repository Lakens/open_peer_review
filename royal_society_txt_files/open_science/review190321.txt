Dear authors,
It was a pleasure to reading the manuscript on pigmentation plasticity in copepods from low-
latitude habitats you have submitted to the Royal Society Open Access Journal. The Blue Holes
obviously provide an ideal opportunity to study community responses to environmental
conditions, in this case UV exposure and predation pressure. It is, however, a little bit
unfortunate that the community composition was so drastically different among the three holes,
i.e. cyclopoids in no and high predation environment and calanoids in the intermediate system.
This topic is addressed in the discussion (lines 240 ff) but I would suggest to removing this from
results (maybe mention in the methods section), as you clearly state that such comparison does
not yield much information.
In the detailed comments you will also find a question as to how many copepods were examined.
I gather that it was always five individuals from each container, yielding 25 measurements for
each group (see also Fig. 3 legend). It it would be nice if you could state this more clearly in the
methods section.
When I started working on the manuscript, I downloaded a zip file with the pictures of the
copepods. Now, that I am finalizing my review, I tried to find the zip file on the web site again
but I have not been successful, maybe because I am so terribly late for which I would like to
apologize. I actually found the pictures interesting and helpful, and I would think they would
make a good contribution to the supplement.
The text I found very well written, the figures clear and the conclusions are sound. I therefore
recommend the manuscript for publication after minor revision.
Specific comments
Line 95 “This range…allow” – shouldn´t this be “allows” (singular)?
Line 105: lowest, and those with both zooplanktivorous and piscivorous fish would
have an intermediate level.
Could you elaborate on why you hypothesize that those have an intermediate level of
pigmentation? I would assume that if zooplanktivorous fishes are present, they would prey on
zooplankton anyway, no matter if there are piscivorous fishes in the same habitat. The only
mechanisms I could think of (and you apparently do, too, as becomes apparent from sentences
below) is the number of zooplanktivorous fishes being reduced but the fish abundance is not
clearly presented in your manuscript (see line 118/119 – a little bit more detailed information
already here in not only in the supplement (see line 123) would be appreciated by the reader, I
believe).
Line 146: How did you divide the zooplankton populations?
3
Line 161: How many copepods did you study per replicate – is it five per replicate /container (see
line 187) yielding 25 measurements or is it one per replicate. Please, clarify.
Legend Fig. 3: I believe it would be nice if you could add that this figure shows the effect of the
removal of UV expose and the exposure to predatory clues. As it is, I had to go for and back
between the results and the methods section to understand what exactly is presented.

Using a combination of population comparisons and a common garden laboratory experiment to
test the combined effects of UVR and predation threats on the phenotypically plastic color
morphs of low-latitude copepods. The manuscript is clearly presented and I have no serious
concerns; the concerns I do have are intended to improve the clarity of the text.
Field sampling: some additional details are needed on the collection sites. Do they differ in area,
depth, shade cover or other traits? For readers unfamiliar with the sites, some description would
be useful. Likewise, only three sites were used (effectively, n = 1 per predation level). While not a
critical flaw, some acknowledgement of this potential limitation is warranted.

In the presented study, the authors investigate the pigmentation of copepods in a natural “blue
hole” system in the Bahamas. Most studies on zooplankton pigmentation are from higher
latitudes which show highly variable levels of UV and predation stress throughout the year.
Contrary to that few studies come from low latitude system where “threat” levels are assumed to
be more constant. I agree with the authors that there is a lack of zooplankton studies focusing on
the lower latitudes. The authors contribute to fill this gap with a study in a fascinating system of
blue hole ecosystems. They combine field observations with an experiment testing for the
influence of predator cues and UV radiation. The authors could confirm that in a habitat with
predators, copepods had less pigmentation. However contrary to their expectation animals
plastically lost pigmentation after the removal of UV.
I liked the study design, with its combination of field measurements and lab experiment. The
study uses three blue holes of differing predation regimes and measures the pigmentation of the
zooplankton in them. The field sampling and photo measuring and analysis seem to be have
done properly.
The pattern follows the findings from higher latitudes with least pigments in the low latitudes.
Given that there was only one pool per predation regime it would be good to discuss in one or
two sentences about the generality of the field sampling results in the discussion part.
My comments are relatively minor and mostly focus on getting some additional information
about the sites, and some more explanations to specific results.
I generally would love to get a bit more information about the blue holes, study site, maybe with
a small map. Are the freshwater layers of the same depths? Can the copepods do vertical
migration during daytime to escape both UV or fish predation?

Comment: I assume the sampling/measuring was done randomly with respect to the treatments
over time. I was wondering whether the authors saw any effect of day time on pigmentation?

Comment: It is a bit unclear how this is reducing stress? By adding food?

and a high density of G. hubbsi, hereafter ‘high-predation’. (p6, l 119)
Comment: Is it only fish predators in this system or could there be also other visual maybe
invertebrate predators in the pools which would be invisible to the human observer.
Excerpt: Regardless of predation-risk treatment, the no- and low-predation risk populations lost
pigmentation (in both redness and yellowness) in the absence of UVR, whereas the high-
predation risk population increased pigmentation…

Comment: How much gene exchange is there between the populations? Could that somehow
influence how adapted the populations are to the conditions in the different pools?

blue hole (hatched line). The values depicted here represent the least square means and the ± 2

Comment: I think it would be good to mention in the figure caption that this is the change due to
lack of UV.

get a feel of the variation in the population and to follow the call of Weissgerber et al 205

Subject Editor Comments to Authors:
Thanks for your attention to the reviewers' concerns. It has come to our attention that, while there
is additional information about the field site, you did not publish the data or code to analyse it.
Can you please rectify this in the final version? Thanks so much.

Response to Referees’ comments
Dear Professor Standen,
Thank you for your kind recommendation to publish in Royal Society Open Science. We are
delighted! We would also like to take this opportunity to take all the reviewers for their time
and effort in providing such constructive feedback. Please find a point by point list of the
specific comments and reference to where we believe these concerns have been addressed.
If there is anything further you require, please do not hesitate to contact.
Yours truly,
Marcus Lee
Reviewer 1
Line 95 “This range…allow” – shouldn´t this be “allows” (singular)?
Addressed (p.5, l.109) allow is correct in this instance as its not singular
Line 105: lowest, and those with both zooplanktivorous and piscivorous fish would
have an intermediate level.
Could you elaborate on why you hypothesize that those have an intermediate level of pigmentation?
Addressed (p.6, l.119) We have explicitly stated the intermediate level is due to reduced predation
pressure
Line 146: How did you divide the zooplankton populations?
Addressed (p.8, l164) We have introduced a sentence to explain in more detail the setup of the
treatments
Line 161: How many copepods did you study per replicate – is it five per replicate /container (see line
187) yielding 25 measurements or is it one per replicate. Please, clarify.
Addressed (p.9, l.205) We have made the sample size for each group more obvious in the statistical
analysis section
Legend Fig. 3: I believe it would be nice if you could add that this figure shows the effect of the removal
of UV expose and the exposure to predatory clues. As it is, I had to go for and back between the results
and the methods section to understand what exactly is presented.
Addressed (p.16, l.359) We altered the figure legend as per request
Reviewer 2
Field sampling: some additional details are needed on the collection sites. Do they differ in area, depth,
shade cover or other traits?
Addressed (p.7, l.128) We recognise the variation in blue hole features, but the full range of
environmental traits surrounding these blue holes were not assessed here.
Line 150: was ‘fresh’ water samples used for daily water changes? Presumably predator odours decay
rapidly.
Addressed (p.8, l.171) We discuss that we aimed to maximise the predator cues while preventing damage
to the individuals and therefore performed water exchange every other day
Only three sites were used (effectively, n = 1 per predation level). While not a critical flaw, some
acknowledgement of this potential limitation is warranted.
Addressed (p.12, l.277) We acknowledge the n = 1 of the pigmentation in natural populations
Reviewer 3
It is a bit unclear how this is reducing stress? By adding food?
Addressed (p.8 l.166) ‘reducing stress’ By stress we intended to mean the mechanical disturbance of
changing the water and the likelihood of injuring an individual through this process, as it would be
possible to repeat this procedure more often yet risk mortality of focal individuals
Given that there was only one pool per predation regime it would be good to discuss in one or two
sentences about the generality of the field sampling results in the discussion part.
Addressed (p.12, l.277) We mention that further samples would help increase the generality
Are they always exposed to UV or can they escape to deeper water layers?
Addressed (p.12, l.298) We make it more evident that diel vertical migration is possible in these blue
holes, but currently there is no information as to whether they do conduct these movements in this
system, so we refrain from discussing it too deeply
I assume the sampling/measuring was done randomly with respect to the treatments over time. I was
wondering whether the authors saw any effect of day time on pigmentation?
Addressed (p.8, l.177) Yes, each container was randomly selected with respect to treatments and we did
not note any difference in pigmentation changes on an hourly scale. We also did not look for that so it’s
possible there were minute changes not observable to the human eye.
How much gene exchange is there between the populations? Could that somehow influence how
adapted the populations are to the conditions in the different pools?
Response to comment about gene flow:
There has been no work conducted on dispersal across this system in zooplankton and as such hard to
discuss with relation to this particular trait. It is possible that infrequent gene flow maintains the need for
plasticity, and we do make reference to this in the discussion (p.13, l.330), but without specific evidence in
this system it is hard to describe how adapted these organisms are to their native habitats.
Is it only fish predators in this system or could there be also other visual maybe invertebrate predators in
the pools which would be invisible to the human observer?
Addressed (supplementary) we highlight that predation risk is non-zero even for the ‘no predation risk’
environment, but due to the vast differences in fish versus invertebrate feeding rates we determine that
this is likely not altering the outcome of the results reported
I think it would be good to mention in the figure caption that this is the change due to lack of UV.
Addressed (p.16, l.359) We altered the figure legend as per request
It would be great to plot the raw data
Addressed (supplementary) We completely agree that the variation in the population will be important
however we believe this removes attention from the story of the figure. So for clarity we include the raw
data in a separate figure in the supplementary information.

Dear Professor Padian,
Thank you for accepting the manuscript for publication. In response to your comments, I
believe you are referring to the raw data relating to turbidity measurements. I have now
uploaded these data to dryad data repository and the code for the analysis performed. I
hope this is satisfactory.
Yours truly,
Marcus Lee
