In my own opinion, this response, adds nothing new, this text is devoid of any scientific
argument.
Line 31, in agreement with Thierry Onkelinx, I don't think the statistic use in Rydell et al. 2017 are
correct, because multiple tests are performed on the same data set, which would have need
correction or global modelling as purpose by Thierry Onkelinx.
In addition only such mixed modelling allow separates the survey effect and the light status
effect. In addition mixed modelling allow consider all the data set, while the McNemar test
requires all data to be paired and thus didnot consider unpaired data, thus in turn in Rydel et al.
studiy this test is performed on subset of the initial dataset. Finally mixed modelling provide
confidence intervals.
Line 32, In my own opinion the result of the modelling purposed by Thierry Onkelinx did not
provided the same result than Rydell et al. 2017.
(i) the 2016 survey, see difference of results for comparison between dark and partly unlit
(ii) the comparison with 1980s survey, while Rydell et al 2017 write "This change in the frequency
of bat presence over time is highly significant", the modelling purposed by Thierry Onkelinx
conclude the "difference in odds for finding no bats between both surveys is unclear"
(iii) Effect of renovation, while Rydell et al 2017 write "that churches were abandoned because of
the lights rather than renovations", the modelling purposed by Thierry Onkelinx conclude that
"we cannot make a hard statement that one is worse than the other"
3
Globally the interpretations of Thierry Onkelinx are quite carefully and based on robust statistics
Lines 37-46, I think that the choice to publis in open access journal is a very nice option, when the
paper is dedicated partially to non scientific readers such as managers. However, in these case
such non scientific readers have not the possibility to judge the relevance of the statistics used
(contrary to academic secientists). Statistic must then be irreproachable, because such type of
readers can only trust the authors. Authors have then a greatest responsibility.

1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi

5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
5
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-171630)
Response to reviewers
Reviewer 1. Suggested publish as it is.
Our response: We follow the suggestion, no changes made.
Reviewer 2.
Paragr. 1. …adds nothing new, text is devoid of any scientific argument…
Our response: Does this mean that that the reviewer suggests that we should not publish our
comment? Our point was that it may sometimes be useful to keep science as simple as possible, to
facilitate the understanding of the work by a broader public. We believe that this is an important
point, but we don´t know if it should be considered a “scientific argument” or not. We decided to
retain our comment, and did not change anything in response to this.
Paragraph 2-3. In agreement with Onkelinx …
Our response: This suggests that it has already been covered in Onkelinx´ original comment, and
if so, there is nothing new. But this is outside our field of expertise and there is nothing we can
add.
Paragraph 4-5. Line 32… and Globally…
Our response: Firstly, we cannot evaluate who is right and there is certainly no point to argue
because we do not have sufficient expertise on this. It may well be that the interpretation of the
statistical tests are slightly different depending on which test was used and on how the question
was formulated. For example, “Onkelinx´ conclusion that “we cannot make a hard statement that
one is worse than the other” is presumably correct, but we never asked what was worse. Instead,
our question was if the observed effect could be explained by renovations rather than lights
(generally). This question is slightly different and the answer was therefore not exactly the same
as Onkelinx´.
We have changed the wording in 2nd half of first paragraph of our comment according to the
reviewer´s second point (paragraph 5), but we have not changed anything in response to
reviewer´s paraghraph 4, as we think this has already been covered by Onkelinx.
Last paragraph. Line 37-46.
Our response: We take this as if our decision to publish open access was OK. We do not
understand the meaning of the rest of the paragraph and what the problem is. Hence, we did not
change anything in response to this.
