Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Here, Belyk and colleagues examined the accuracy of vocal imitation by human participants.
Testing the hypothesis that vocal imitation involving laryngeal control would be poorer than that
involving predominantly oral effectors, the authors measured pitch imitation during singing and
during whistling. Their results indicated significantly greater imprecision and inaccuracy for
notes and intervals produced whilst singing, as compared to whistling. The authors observed that
sung notes tended to be flat, whereas whistled notes tended to be sharp. The authors also found
differential imitation accuracy as a function of increasing stimulus F0, where particularly for
singing, vocal pitch was flattened as stimulus F0 increased. The authors interpret their findings
with respect to the late evolutionary emergence of vocal imitation in primates, suggesting that
these skills appear to be phylogentically recent adaptations in great apes, which are error-prone.
This an interesting paper, and presents observations which will be useful to the field. The
manuscript is well-written, and the analyses are generally well-conducted. However, I have a
number of methodological concerns, and several queries concerning the results. I would need to
see that the comments below have been addressed in detail before recommending the manuscript
for publication.
-- Abstract
'Human participants imitated simple melodies by either singing (i.e., producing pitch with the
larynx)'
This is a rather simplistic view of singing - singing is an extremely complex sensorimotor
behaviour, involving many of the same neural and muscular systems as speech, and which places
demands on precise control of breathing, airflow and articulator position. Please amend to
include brief mention of the broader range of behaviours involved.
-- Introduction
p.3: 'This ability is rare among mammals [2,3]'
Perhaps the authors mean this ability is rare among primates? As the authors allude to in the
discussion, there are several other mammalian species that possess the capacity for incredibly
complex vocal production, presumably learned through imitation [e.g., Jaquet, Dawson &
Douglas (2001), JASA].
p.4, 2nd paragraph
The authors make the case for the direct projection from the laryngeal motor cortex to the nucleus
ambiguus as being a putative anatomical substrate that explains the improved vocal imitation
abilities of humans compared to other primates. In reality, as the authors mention in the
discussion, the anatomical and functional underpinnings of vocal imitation in the brain are far
more complex. In particular, reference needs to be made here to comparative anatomical studies
of human and primate cortical structure, which may account for some of the differences in oral
motor control and vocal proficiecy between species [e.g., Sherwood et al. (2004). Brain Behav
3
Evol; Petrides et al. (2005). Nature; Jain et al. (2001). J Compar Neurol; Cerkevich et al. (2013). J
Compar Neurol].
-- Methods
p.4, Stimuli
'Two sets of 45 melodies were composed by random computerized composition. The first note of
each melody was selected at random from a chromatic scale. Subsequent notes were determined
by sampling from a flat distribution of interval sizes, ranging ± 4 semitones. This process was
performed iteratively until all notes fell within the range of a single octave.'
Did each of the synthesised melodies adhere to the diatonic intervalic structure found in major
and minor keys in Western music? Selecting from an arbitrary ±4 semitone range for the
synthesised notes would not necessarily guarantee that the melodies adhered to a musical system
that would be familiar to participants - if the intervalic relations were atonal (for instance), it is
likely that imitation accuracy would suffer. Please clarify.
p.5, Participants
'Only data from the remaining 28 participants were analyzed. These participants had a median
age of 21 years (range 18-29), 20 were female, 9 self-identified as a good singer, 15 self-identified
as a good whistler, 26 had some degree of formal musical training (2-15 years) but only two of
these had any vocal training. All participants reported normal hearing and no vocal pathology.'
Were any standardised measures of musical training collected (e.g., Goldsmiths MSI musical
training subscale)? Accurate control of musical training history (particularly involving any form
of pitch production) would be critical to the present study design. Please clarify whether any
standardised measurements were collected. If none, please include a supplemental table detailing
the musical training history of each participant, including the years of training, instrument of
experience, and the time between cessation of training and the experiment (where applicable).
p.5, Individual assessment of producible pitches
'Participants were instructed to sing 1) a stable and comfortable pitch, 2) a descending sweep
from a comfortable pitch to their lowest producible note, and 3) an ascending sweep from a
comfortable pitch to their highest producible note'
Please clarify what is meant by a descending/ascending 'sweep'. Is this a smoothly varying pitch
contour produced with a single sustained breath? Or a series of rapidly produced
descending/ascending staccato notes?
Please also detail the parameters used for the Praat pitch tracking algorithm. Were these adapted
or changed for males and females?
p.6, Imitation task
The authors report in stimuli that the duration of each note was 750 ms. Did the authors measure
pitches as produced by the participants as the mean across the full 750 ms duration for each note,
per trial? Or did they take a central pitch value from the midpoint of each ~750 ms production
and analyse the pitch there? If the onsets and offsets of each note (e.g., initial and latter 50 ms or
so) were included in the pitch analysis, this may increase measurement error - please clarify.
4
What class of speech phone did the participants use to imitate the pitches? Presumably a vowel?
Were all participants instructed to use the same phone?
p.7, Acoustic analysis
'Melodies that were produced with too few or too many notes were excluded from further
analysis since the position of omitted or duplicated notes were not possible to determine.'
Please indicate what percentage of trials overall were excluded.
-- Results
p.8, 3rd paragraph:
'We constructed four sets of nested LMMs to predict note inaccuracy, interval inaccuracy, note
imprecision, and interval imprecision from the two modalities of imitation and from MBEA
scores, with participant modeled as a random intercept [30,31]. The effects of pitch-production
modality and perceptual ability were tested by comparing nested LMMs, p-values were
calculated using the Kenward-Roger approximation [32].'
From the above description, it appears the authors included pitch production modality and
MBEA scores as the only fixed effects in the model - is this correct? If they did not do so, I would
strongly encourage the authors to re-fit the models adding gender and any years of musical
training as additional covariates.
While I appreciate that the MBEA scores would be expected to pattern with musical expertise, in
practice, most participants had musical experience (the authors report 26 of 28 in methods). So it
seems unlikely that the variation in MBEA alone would explain differences in pitch production
due to musical training in a sufficiently fine-grained way - for instance, how many of the
participants showed a ceiling effect on the MBEA? From the mean and SD reported (86.4±9.6), I'd
guess quite a few (after all, discriminating between two melodies is necessarily an easier task
than reproducing a melody by oneself!)
I'd like the authors to ensure that variation due to musical training is carefully controlled for in
the analyses, and as the multi-level models stand, it doesn't appear that this has been achieved
with adding the MBEA scores alone.
In addition, control of gender is quite critical for their present analyses, given the differences in
vocal ranges between males and females, and corresponding differences in the stimuli used.
p.9-10, Inaccuracy
It seems surprising that a significant relationship between singing and whistling scores was
observed for imprecision but not for inaccuracy. Can the authors explain why this might be? Is it
perhaps due to imprecision arising from within-subject variability, whereas inaccuracy reflects
subjects' deviation with respect to a fixed reference? Please elaborate.
Figure 4
I'd like to see the authors produce an additional version of Figure 4 included in supplemental
materials that plots the median ± interquartile range for each note. I appreciate means ± std. err.
5
were plotted in line with the parametric multi-level model analyses; but given the variation the
authors highlight, I'd prefer to see plots that are less likely to be biased by outlying data points.
From this figure, it also appears that the authors collapsed males and females? This is
problematic, given that the pitches females imitated were an octave above those imitated by
males, and thus not directly comparable (particularly given the non-linearities in perception of
pitch for F0 increases <1 kHz - presumably the basis for the authors' use of the Mel scale). I would
strongly suggest separating the figure by gender.
## Discussion
p.12: 'While the larynx motor area of monkeys is found in premotor cortex and has limited
involvement in vocal behaviour [82-85], the human larynx-motor area is found in primary-motor
cortex and has clear involvement in regulating vocal behaviour [86-95].'
The authors should indicate here that the location of the laryngeal motor area shows considerable
variation across individuals (see Carey et al., 2017, Cereb Cortex); moreover, its precise location
with respect to borders of motor versus somatosensory cortex remains unclear - 'somatomotor'
would be a more appropriate term here.
p.12: 'Likewise, monkeys lack a direct connection between the larynx-motor cortex and the
nucleus ambiguus, which is the brainstem-motor nucleus that controls the laryngeal muscles
[27,28]. Apes have a sparse, but extant, direct pathway between these areas, that is slightly more
abundant in humans [24,25]. Vocal behaviour driven by primary-motor cortex began to evolve
before the divergence of humans from other apes, but was elaborated over human evolution.
Several theorists have speculated that the emergence of this pathway may have been a
prerequisite to the evolution of speech [101105].'
The authors have directed this section heavily towards evolution of primary motor projections to
subcortical nuclei that innervate the laryngeal musculature via the vagus nerve. As outlined in
my comments on the introduction, I think more nuance is required here. Vocal imitation involves
a vast array of neural resources, far beyond primary motor pathways that project to the
brainstem.
Given the heavily learned nature of vocal communication in humans, it is quite typical to see
involvement of cerebellar regions (particularly lobules V/VI) in vocal imitation tasks. Moreover,
a recently published study examining imitation of unfamiliar speech (Carey et al., 2017,
NeuroImage) showed that insular, SMA and pre-SMA functional activation that preceded
imitation (i.e., during the transformation from the perceived target item to the articulatory
output) was significantly associated with accuracy of vocal imitation indexed behaviourally at
pre-scan (see also Garnier et al., 2013, Frontiers Psychol, for results on similar mechanisms
specific to vocal pitch imitation).
I think the authors need to consider the broader network of regions involved in human vocal
communication at this juncture, and outline the role of a wider variety of neural processes in
facilitating imitation.
p.15: 'This compression suggests that each individuals larynx may have a preferred frequency
that it produces in a default configuration. This leads us to hypothesize that pitches produced at a
participants most accurate note may require the least muscular effort, while pitches further from
this preferred note, in either direction, may require greater muscular effort.'
While this may be true, it's not clear to me that the authors' current analyses support this
6
conclusion. The authors would need to relate the preferred note of each participant to their most
deviant note - if the authors are correct, one would expect a positive relationship between
distance from the preferred note and the maximally deviant pitch that a participant produces. As
far as I can see, this has not been modelled explicitly.
p.15, final paragraph: 'The net influence of the TA muscle in either increasing or decreasing F0
strongly depends on non-linear interactions with the CT muscle, the range of frequencies being
produced, vocal register, and expiratory force [48,120,121].'
I'd like the authors to expand on these points. In particular, an issue I had with the discussion,
and the paper in general, is the assumption that we can explain pitch differences in vocal
imitation predominantly on the basis of laryngeal control. It is unlikely that the explanation is as
simple as this.
Singing requires significantly more complex control of the upper airway than mere manipulation
of laryngeal position. For instance, the shape of the lip aperture and nature of tongue positioning
will have a significant bearing on the airflow during phonation, which will impact on pitch. More
broadly, the authors have attended little (if at all) to control of the diaphragm during singing - the
strength and stability of the diaphragm during sustained phonation is critical to ensuring that
singing pitch remains stable and constant (indeed, a hallmark of novice singing is the
uncontrolled flattening of pitch - or 'warble' - due to poor diaphragmatic control).
The authors need to include explanation of the effects in the present study with respect to control
of airflow, and the broader set of respiratory mechanisms involved.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Carolyn McGettigan):
We have now received comments from two expert reviewers, whose comments are included
here. Both are enthusiastic about the study but have several queries that should be addressed in a
substantial revision of the manuscript. I agree with the reviewers that it will be important to
elaborate on the context and motivation for the current study within the comparative literature

to make clear that sung imitation involves more than laryngeal control. The authors also ask for
greater clarity on a number of methodological points, and include requests for revisions to the
presentation of results. Please consider all of these points in your response, and in revising the
manuscript.

-- Methods
p.4, Stimuli
'Two sets of 45 melodies were composed by random computerized composition. The first note of

p.5, Participants
'Only data from the remaining 28 participants were analyzed. These participants had a median

'Participants were instructed to sing 1) a stable and comfortable pitch, 2) a descending sweep
from a comfortable pitch to their lowest producible note, and 3) an ascending sweep from a

11
Please clarify what is meant by a descending/ascending 'sweep'. Is this a smoothly varying pitch
contour produced with a single sustained breath? Or a series of rapidly produced
descending/ascending staccato notes?
Please also detail the parameters used for the Praat pitch tracking algorithm. Were these adapted
or changed for males and females?
p.6, Imitation task
The authors report in stimuli that the duration of each note was 750 ms. Did the authors measure
pitches as produced by the participants as the mean across the full 750 ms duration for each note,

and analyse the pitch there? If the onsets and offsets of each note (e.g., initial and latter 50 ms or
so) were included in the pitch analysis, this may increase measurement error - please clarify.

p.7, Acoustic analysis
'Melodies that were produced with too few or too many notes were excluded from further

strongly depends on non-linear interactions with the CT muscle, the range of frequencies being
produced, vocal register, and expiratory force [48,120,121].'
I'd like the authors to expand on these points. In particular, an issue I had with the discussion,
and the paper in general, is the assumption that we can explain pitch differences in vocal
imitation predominantly on the basis of laryngeal control. It is unlikely that the explanation is as
simple as this.
Singing requires significantly more complex control of the upper airway than mere manipulation
of laryngeal position. For instance, the shape of the lip aperture and nature of tongue positioning
will have a significant bearing on the airflow during phonation, which will impact on pitch. More
broadly, the authors have attended little (if at all) to control of the diaphragm during singing - the
strength and stability of the diaphragm during sustained phonation is critical to ensuring that
singing pitch remains stable and constant (indeed, a hallmark of novice singing is the
uncontrolled flattening of pitch - or 'warble' - due to poor diaphragmatic control).
The authors need to include explanation of the effects in the present study with respect to control
of airflow, and the broader set of respiratory mechanisms involved.

Appendix A
In the manuscript Poor tuning of the human larynx: Comparison of sung and
whistled pitch imitation the authors report that human participants are less precise in
sang imitations of melodies, compared to whistled imitations of the same melodies.
Based on this finding, they suggest that, in primates, volitional control over the
articulatory muscles, such as the tongue and lips - which are involved in whistling,
may have emerged earlier than volition control over the laryngeal muscles, which are
involved in voice modulation in speech.
In my opinion the topic is crucial for advancing our understanding of the evolution of
vocal communication. I think it is certainly worth considering it for publication.
However, I have some concerns about the theoretical framing and the methodology,
which should be dealt with. This has the risk of significantly changing the outcome of
the study. Thus I recommend it for major revision.
My comments below.
Title
Please consider making it more informative. Is it really the larynx itself that is poorly
tuned to the sound?
Abstract
In the abstract and throughout the paper, the authors use the term pitch. This term
refers to the subjective perception of F0, and might be influenced by other factors,
such as duration or intensity of the sound. For this reason, and in the interest of
terminological precision, I suggest replacing all instances of pitch with fundamental
frequency.
Introduction
Please add description of the following research topics:
- source-filter theory.
For instance, see: Taylor A, Reby D. (2010). The contribution of source filter
theory to mammal vocal communication research. J. Zool. 280, 221  236.
- motor control over lip-smacking and its link to speech:
Morrill, R. J., Paukner, A., Ferrari, P. F., & Ghazanfar, A. A. (2012). Monkey
lipsmacking develops like the human speech rhythm. Developmental

tuned to facial expressions that exhibit a theta-like speech rhythm. Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(5), 1959- 1963;
- speech ready vocal tracts in monkeys:
Fitch, W. T., de Boer, B., Mathur, N., & Ghazanfar, A. A. (2016). Monkey vocal
tracts are speech-ready. Science advances, 2(12), e1600723) 

... & Fagot, J. (2017). Evidence of a Vocalic Proto-System in the Baboon
(Papio papio) Suggests Pre-Hominin Speech Precursors. PloS one, 12(1),
e0169321.
Lines 43-54 (Furthermore, sung notes...) seems to interrupt description of control
precision over sung or whistled imitations. Please consider moving at the end of the
abstract or after first period in line 42.
Lines 56-59: Please elaborate a bit on this claim. What do you mean with novel
sounds here? What precise sound sources are the great apes using? I agree that
vocal production in great apes typically doesnt go beyond an innate repertoire.
However, I suggest mentioning studies showing a certain amount of variability in
sound production, for instance:
de Boer, B., Wich, S. A., Hardus, M. E., & Lameira, A. R. (2015). Acoustic
models of orangutan hand-assisted alarm calls. Journal of Experimental
Biology, 218(6), 907-914.

tract flexibility and variation in the vocal output in wild
indris. Bioacoustics, 20(3), 251-265.
Geissmann, T. (2002). Duet-splitting and the evolution of gibbon
songs. Biological Reviews, 77(1), 57-76.
Prat, Y., Azoulay, L., Dor, R., & Yovel, Y. (2017). Crowd vocal learning induces
vocal dialects in bats: Playback of conspecifics shapes fundamental frequency
usage by pups. PLoS biology, 15(10), e2002556.
Stoeger, A. S., Mietchen, D., Oh, S., de Silva, S., Herbst, C. T., Kwon, S., &
Fitch, W. T. (2012). An Asian elephant imitates human speech. Current
Biology, 22(22), 2144-2148.
Following on this, I recommend moving lines 311-314 on research on vocal learning
abilities in other mammals (bats, elephants, etc) to the introduction. A wide research
area is dedicated to vocal learning and dialects in birds.
Furthermore, the ability to flexibly modulate amplitude, temporal and F0 information,
in coordination with, or in response to other signalers - as in the context of duets,
choruses and antiphonal calling - is widespread across animal species (for an
exhaustive review, see Filippi, P. (2016). Emotional and interactional prosody across
animal communication systems: a comparative approach to the emergence of
language. Frontiers in psychology, 7). I believe that including this topic in the
introduction may provide a more complete picture of the theoretical background of
the study.
Some people are poor at imitating languages that are not their native one. Does this
relate to the limited control over singing notes?
Lines 71-82: Referring to precise imitation of sounds through digital instruments
might mislead the readers. Im not sure this is relevant here, and in any case it
doesnt really add much to the info provided in the previous section. Please consider
deleting, or synthesizing in just a couple of sentences, stressing the point made in
lines 81-82.
Lines 93-94: These tasks were highly matched in auditory and cognitive demands.
Please provide more information justifying this sentence. For instance, can you be
more specific about the type of singing? Was this humming, or singing repeated
syllables?
Methods
Please provide representative melody (audio) samples in supplementary materials.
Procedures
- Please report statistical power analysis. How you assessed number of participants?
- line 129: How are self-identification rating useful here?
- Musical training may be a crucial confound in this case... even more so, musical
training in singing. Please, exclude musicians with vocal training from the analysis,
and report updated results. In addition, please report on effect of instrumental
musical training on experimental tasks.
- Was the order of tasks counter-balanced? If not, please justify.
Acoustic analysis
Lines 170-171: Please clarify.
Lines 171-172: Please perform and report dynamic time warping analysis (Keogh EJ,
Pazzani MJ. Derivative dynamic time warping. First SIAM International Conference
on Data Mining (sdm2001) 2001:111). For an instance of its application, see:
Verhoef, T. (2012). The origins of duality of patterning in artificial whistled
languages. Language and cognition, 4(4), 357-380. This technique may allow you to
include melodies with too few or too many notes.
Lines 178-179: please provide more details on this analysis.
Line 188: please choose one term between inconsistency and variability, and
delete the other.
Line 191: mean signed? Please clarify.
Line 244: please clarify what this correlation may be due to beside perceptual
abilities.
Results
check Brunos stats where you compare two melody lines over time
Discussion
Please, start over with synthesis of results. Consider moving section The relatively
recent evolution of the vocal-motor system right after this synthesis, followed by the
description of the link between your findings and the existing literature.
Line 276: Please specify what trained singers are less precise on.
Lines 290-298: Please explain the link between the ability for singing or whistling and
the ability for speech. More specifically, I suggest to clarify how the comparison of the
abilities for singing and whistling notes relates to the evolution of motor control over
laryngeal muscles for speech production and human language. Following this, I think
that reference to brain and behavioral research on whistled languages here would
improve this discussion:

VIEWER 1
mments to the Author(s)
re, Belyk and colleagues examined the accuracy of vocal imitation by human
ticipants. Testing the hypothesis that vocal imitation involving laryngeal control would
poorer than that involving predominantly oral effectors, the authors measured pitch
tation during singing and during whistling. Their results indicated significantly greater
recision and inaccuracy for notes and intervals produced whilst singing, as
mpared to whistling. The authors observed that sung notes tended to be flat, whereas
istled notes tended to be sharp. The authors also found differential imitation accuracy
a function of increasing stimulus F0, where particularly for singing, vocal pitch was
tened as stimulus F0 increased. The authors interpret their findings with respect to
late evolutionary emergence of vocal imitation in primates, suggesting that these
ls appear to be phylogentically recent adaptations in great apes, which are error-
ne.
s an interesting paper, and presents observations which will be useful to the field.
e manuscript is well-written, and the analyses are generally well-conducted.
wever, I have a number of methodological concerns, and several queries concerning
results. I would need to see that the comments below have been addressed in detail
ore recommending the manuscript for publication.
bstract
man participants imitated simple melodies by either singing (i.e., producing pitch with
larynx)'
s is a rather simplistic view of singing - singing is an extremely complex sensorimotor
haviour, involving many of the same neural and muscular systems as speech, and
ich places demands on precise control of breathing, airflow and articulator position.
ase amend to include brief mention of the broader range of behaviours involved.
ply: We agree that everyday singing (which usually includes singing words) is
omplex motor act that involves all of the muscles of speech. However, singing
ple melodies on a neutral carrier vowel goes a long way towards isolating the
yngeal muscles as it is essentially a hum with the lips parted to prevent
ratory sensations at the lips.
ile we think that a relatively simple view is appropriate for the abstract, we
ve considerably expanded the introduction to provide a review of the source-
er model as a way of discussing the various muscle groups involved in sound
duction. Although this model is usually applied to speech production, we find
o be a generally useful framework for thinking about the vocal-tract
sculature, and indeed it is also a useful approach to vocal behaviour in non-
2
man mammals (see Taylor & Reby) (lines 75-81). We also discuss some of the
eractions between vocal tract muscles in the discussion (lines 356-363)

munication research. J. Zool. 280, 221236.
ntroduction
: 'This ability is rare among mammals [2,3]'
rhaps the authors mean this ability is rare among primates? As the authors allude to
he discussion, there are several other mammalian species that possess the capacity
incredibly complex vocal production, presumably learned through imitation [e.g.,
uet, Dawson & Douglas (2001), JASA].
ply: We have expanded this section to explicitly acknowledge the mammalian
des for which there is evidence of vocal imitation, although we do maintain
t rare among mammals is still a fair statement. (lines 66-67)
, 2nd paragraph
e authors make the case for the direct projection from the laryngeal motor cortex to
nucleus ambiguus as being a putative anatomical substrate that explains the
roved vocal imitation abilities of humans compared to other primates. In reality, as
authors mention in the discussion, the anatomical and functional underpinnings of
al imitation in the brain are far more complex. In particular, reference needs to be
de here to comparative anatomical studies of human and primate cortical structure,
ich may account for some of the differences in oral motor control and vocal proficiecy
ween species [e.g., Sherwood et al. (2004). Brain Behav Evol; Petrides et al. (2005).
ture; Jain et al. (2001). J Compar Neurol; Cerkevich et al. (2013). J Compar Neurol].
ply: We now acknowledge that there are other neuro-comparative differences
primate vocal-tract related areas, although we do not enter into detail (lines
0-122). We hope the reviewer will agree that this provides more balance without
using too great of a digression from the hypothesis that this paragraph
empts to motivate. (lines 120-123)
ethods
, Stimuli
o sets of 45 melodies were composed by random computerized composition. The
t note of each melody was selected at random from a chromatic scale. Subsequent
es were determined by sampling from a flat distribution of interval sizes, ranging ± 4
3
mitones. This process was performed iteratively until all notes fell within the range of
ingle octave.'
each of the synthesised melodies adhere to the diatonic intervalic structure found in
jor and minor keys in Western music? Selecting from an arbitrary ±4 semitone range
the synthesised notes would not necessarily guarantee that the melodies adhered to
usical system that would be familiar to participants - if the intervalic relations were
nal (for instance), it is likely that imitation accuracy would suffer. Please clarify.
ply: Intervals were taken by steps of entire semitones (i,e., we did not use
crotones), hence stimuli were constrained to the chromatic scale but not to
stern major or minor scales. Since our objective was to test a flexible motor
haviour rather than adherence to cultural conventions we do not think that this
problematic. In fact we would argue that obeying the western musical
nventions would have given an undue advantage to musically trained
ticipants who demonstrated no advantage in the experiment as weve
plemented it (see new analyses lines 343-350 and supplementary file 3). Also,
r counter-balanced stimulus should mitigate any bias if it were to exist.
, Participants
ly data from the remaining 28 participants were analyzed. These participants had a
dian age of 21 years (range 18-29), 20 were female, 9 self-identified as a good
ger, 15 self-identified as a good whistler, 26 had some degree of formal musical
ning (2-15 years) but only two of these had any vocal training. All participants
orted normal hearing and no vocal pathology.'
re any standardised measures of musical training collected (e.g., Goldsmiths MSI
sical training subscale)? Accurate control of musical training history (particularly
olving any form of pitch production) would be critical to the present study design.
ase clarify whether any standardised measurements were collected. If none, please
lude a supplemental table detailing the musical training history of each participant,
luding the years of training, instrument of experience, and the time between
sation of training and the experiment (where applicable).
ply: We are not familiar with Goldsmiths MSI though we see that it could be a
eful instrument in the future. We now provide a table of instruments and years
musical training in supplementary file 3.
, Individual assessment of producible pitches
rticipants were instructed to sing 1) a stable and comfortable pitch, 2) a descending
eep from a comfortable pitch to their lowest producible note, and 3) an ascending
eep from a comfortable pitch to their highest producible note'
4
ase clarify what is meant by a descending/ascending 'sweep'. Is this a smoothly
ying pitch contour produced with a single sustained breath? Or a series of rapidly
duced descending/ascending staccato notes?
ase also detail the parameters used for the Praat pitch tracking algorithm. Were
se adapted or changed for males and females?
ply: We now clarify in the text that we mean a smoothly varying pitch contour
e 120). We adapted praat settings on a per participant basis and the first
hor examined every pitch trace for implausible measurements, particularly the
ave jumps which can occur when Pitch Range settings are set inappropriately.
, Imitation task
e authors report in stimuli that the duration of each note was 750 ms. Did the authors
asure pitches as produced by the participants as the mean across the full 750 ms
ation for each note, per trial? Or did they take a central pitch value from the midpoint
each ~750 ms production and analyse the pitch there? If the onsets and offsets of
h note (e.g., initial and latter 50 ms or so) were included in the pitch analysis, this
y increase measurement error - please clarify.
at class of speech phone did the participants use to imitate the pitches? Presumably
owel? Were all participants instructed to use the same phone?
ply: Pitch measurements were taken from the center 250ms of each produced
te (line 234). In all cases this window excluded pitch onsets and offset.
rticipants used a neutral vowel that was also the carrier vowel for the vocally
bred stimuli (line 211).
, Acoustic analysis
lodies that were produced with too few or too many notes were excluded from
her analysis since the position of omitted or duplicated notes were not possible to
ermine.'

ply: 3.6% of trials were excluded (line 237).
esults
, 3rd paragraph:
e constructed four sets of nested LMMs to predict note inaccuracy, interval
ccuracy, note imprecision, and interval imprecision from the two modalities of
5
tation and from MBEA scores, with participant modeled as a random intercept
,31]. The effects of pitch-production modality and perceptual ability were tested by
mparing nested LMMs, p-values were calculated using the Kenward-Roger
proximation [32].'
m the above description, it appears the authors included pitch production modality
d MBEA scores as the only fixed effects in the model - is this correct? If they did not
so, I would strongly encourage the authors to re-fit the models adding gender and
years of musical training as additional covariates.
ile I appreciate that the MBEA scores would be expected to pattern with musical
ertise, in practice, most participants had musical experience (the authors report 26
28 in methods). So it seems unlikely that the variation in MBEA alone would explain
erences in pitch production due to musical training in a sufficiently fine-grained way -
instance, how many of the participants showed a ceiling effect on the MBEA? From
mean and SD reported (86.4±9.6), I'd guess quite a few (after all, discriminating
ween two melodies is necessarily an easier task than reproducing a melody by
eself!)
like the authors to ensure that variation due to musical training is carefully controlled
in the analyses, and as the multi-level models stand, it doesn't appear that this has
en achieved with adding the MBEA scores alone.
addition, control of gender is quite critical for their present analyses, given the
erences in vocal ranges between males and females, and corresponding differences
he stimuli used.
ply: We agree that MBEA should not be taken as a proxy for musical
perience and we use it here only as standard auditory pitch perception
asure. We have refit the models to include both the sex of the participant and
ars of musical training. Following comments from another reviewer we have
o excluded two participants with explicit vocal training.
sical training and sex did not significantly predict any of our dependent
iables. For one measure (interval imprecision) adding the additional predictor
musical experienced rendered a previously significant effect of task (whistling
singing) insignificant. This change is the result of wider confidence intervals
m lost degrees of freedom (due to removing two participants and fitting extra
ameters) rather than to any change in the model estimates. Since the
ditional parameters do not lead us to change our interpretation of the data, we
scribe this analysis briefly and refer readers to supplementary file 3 for further
ails (lines 337-354).
s perhaps useful to point out here why the effect of sex was not significant to
oid misunderstanding. Since men and women sing in different octaves, and the
quencies of notes in these octaves increase exponentially it is reasonable to
6
pect some difficulties in comparing values from men and women since a 1Hz
ference in the male vocal range is not the same as a 1Hz difference in the
ale vocal range. This is why we have converted all of our measurements to
Cents which is calculated by a relative log transform. This effectively centers
d log-scales the measurements to facilities comparisons between different
ch ranges.
-10, Inaccuracy
eems surprising that a significant relationship between singing and whistling scores
s observed for imprecision but not for inaccuracy. Can the authors explain why this
ht be? Is it perhaps due to imprecision arising from within-subject variability,
ereas inaccuracy reflects subjects' deviation with respect to a fixed reference?
ase elaborate.
ply: Our interpretation of this finding is that imprecision reflects neuro-motor
se, some aspects of which may be systemically related between tasks (see
ction on accumulation of error, p15), whereas inaccuracy reflects neuro-motor
s (see section on vocal laziness, p17). We think that this neuro-motor bias is
ven by the stable or least-effortful states of the pitch producing musculature.
our stimuli it happened to be the case that the habitual pitch for singing was
atively low in the stimulus range. This is typical of singing studies since most
ticipants can raise their vocal pitch further than they can lower it, so that most
the available vocal range is above the habitual pitch. Before this study it was
clear what the equivalent behaviour of whistling would be.
ure 4
like to see the authors produce an additional version of Figure 4 included in
plemental materials that plots the median ± interquartile range for each note. I
preciate means ± std. err. were plotted in line with the parametric multi-level model
alyses; but given the variation the authors highlight, I'd prefer to see plots that are
s likely to be biased by outlying data points.
m this figure, it also appears that the authors collapsed males and females? This is
blematic, given that the pitches females imitated were an octave above those
tated by males, and thus not directly comparable (particularly given the non-
arities in perception of pitch for F0 increases <1 kHz - presumably the basis for the
hors' use of the Mel scale). I would strongly suggest separating the figure by gender.
ply: We have updated this figure to report medians and quartiles rather than
ans and standard errors.
7
mentioned above, we chose to convert our measurements to Cents since its
ntering and log-scaling facilitates comparison from different octaves. We have
o reconstructed the plots separately for males and females and note very
ilar trends, although they are more noisy since each is computer from fewer
servations. We have included these figures in supplementary file 4.
Discussion
2: 'While the larynx motor area of monkeys is found in premotor cortex and has
ited involvement in vocal behaviour [82-85], the human larynx-motor area is found in
mary-motor cortex and has clear involvement in regulating vocal behaviour [86-95].'
e authors should indicate here that the location of the laryngeal motor area shows
siderable variation across individuals (see Carey et al., 2017, Cereb Cortex);
reover, its precise location with respect to borders of motor versus somatosensory
tex remains unclear - 'somatomotor' would be a more appropriate term here.
ply: We agree that from brain imaging research (including our own) it is
ficult to separate motor from somatosensory activations. However, some of the
urosurgical research that we cite has been more able to separate these areas
we feel justified in continuing to refer to motor cortex in this context.
wever, we do find the suggested paper informative and it will contribute to the
xt point.
2: 'Likewise, monkeys lack a direct connection between the larynx-motor cortex and
nucleus ambiguus, which is the brainstem-motor nucleus that controls the laryngeal
scles [27,28]. Apes have a sparse, but extant, direct pathway between these areas,
t is slightly more abundant in humans [24,25]. Vocal behaviour driven by primary-
tor cortex began to evolve before the divergence of humans from other apes, but
s elaborated over human evolution. Several theorists have speculated that the
ergence of this pathway may have been a prerequisite to the evolution of speech
1105].'
e authors have directed this section heavily towards evolution of primary motor
jections to subcortical nuclei that innervate the laryngeal musculature via the vagus
ve. As outlined in my comments on the introduction, I think more nuance is required
e. Vocal imitation involves a vast array of neural resources, far beyond primary
tor pathways that project to the brainstem.
en the heavily learned nature of vocal communication in humans, it is quite typical to
involvement of cerebellar regions (particularly lobules V/VI) in vocal imitation tasks.
reover, a recently published study examining imitation of unfamiliar speech (Carey et
2017, NeuroImage) showed that insular, SMA and pre-SMA functional activation
t preceded imitation (i.e., during the transformation from the perceived target item to
8
articulatory output) was significantly associated with accuracy of vocal imitation
exed behaviourally at pre-scan (see also Garnier et al., 2013, Frontiers Psychol, for
ults on similar mechanisms specific to vocal pitch imitation).
ink the authors need to consider the broader network of regions involved in human
al communication at this juncture, and outline the role of a wider variety of neural
cesses in facilitating imitation.
ply: We agree that imitation engages a broad network and indeed most motor
ated areas. We have added an additional paragraph that briefly reviews this
work and support from relevant neuroimaging data, including several studies
ggested by the reviewer. We have aimed to acknowledge this broader network
ile providing context for the laryngeal-motor control discussion that follows.
maintain our focus on M1 afterwards since neuro-comparative differences in
t area are most well documented and have the most direct link to motor output
d the scope of the manuscript. (438-446)
5: 'This compression suggests that each individuals larynx may have a preferred
quency that it produces in a default configuration. This leads us to hypothesize that
hes produced at a participants most accurate note may require the least muscular
ort, while pitches further from this preferred note, in either direction, may require
ater muscular effort.'
ile this may be true, it's not clear to me that the authors' current analyses support
conclusion. The authors would need to relate the preferred note of each participant
heir most deviant note - if the authors are correct, one would expect a positive
ationship between distance from the preferred note and the maximally deviant pitch
t a participant produces. As far as I can see, this has not been modelled explicitly.
ply: We did not intend that this statement should be read as a conclusion, but
her as a hypothesis for further testing. As far as we know this hypothesis is an
irely novel but exploratory product of this study. We think that it is appropriate
register this hypothesis here so that confirmatory tests can be conducted on
ther data. We also think that acoustical tests alone will not be sufficient and
t electromyography will be required for confirmatory testing.
have rephrased this paragraph to place hypothesize earlier in hopes that
s clarifies our position. We have also changed the relevant part of the abstract
frame this explicitly as a hypothesis for further research. (lines 549, 42)
5, final paragraph: 'The net influence of the TA muscle in either increasing or
reasing F0 strongly depends on non-linear interactions with the CT muscle, the
ge of frequencies being produced, vocal register, and expiratory force [48,120,121].'

like the authors to expand on these points. In particular, an issue I had with the
cussion, and the paper in general, is the assumption that we can explain pitch
erences in vocal imitation predominantly on the basis of laryngeal control. It is
ikely that the explanation is as simple as this.
ging requires significantly more complex control of the upper airway than mere
nipulation of laryngeal position. For instance, the shape of the lip aperture and nature
ongue positioning will have a significant bearing on the airflow during phonation,
ich will impact on pitch. More broadly, the authors have attended little (if at all) to
trol of the diaphragm during singing - the strength and stability of the diaphragm
ing sustained phonation is critical to ensuring that singing pitch remains stable and
stant (indeed, a hallmark of novice singing is the uncontrolled flattening of pitch - or
rble' - due to poor diaphragmatic control).
e authors need to include explanation of the effects in the present study with respect
ontrol of airflow, and the broader set of respiratory mechanisms involved.
ly: We are somewhat conflicted here as another reviewer asked that we simplify this
tion in light of the technical nature of muscular-acoustical interactions and the general
dership of RSOS.
propose to leave respiration out of this section on laryngeal fatigue where it might be a
ression, and instead suggest that it would fit more nicely in our section on the
umulation of neuro-motor error. Specifically, we now expand on our statement that the
mon contribution of respiratory motor control to both singing and whistling may be one
tor that contributes to the correlation between singing and whistling imprecision since it
vides the mechanical drive for both behaviours. (lines 535-539s)

VIEWER 2
he manuscript Poor tuning of the human larynx: Comparison of sung and whistled
h imitation the authors report that human participants are less precise in sang
tations of melodies, compared to whistled imitations of the same melodies. Based on
finding, they suggest that, in primates, volitional control over the articulatory
scles, such as the tongue and lips - which are involved in whistling, may have
erged earlier than volition control over the laryngeal muscles, which are involved in
ce modulation in speech.
my opinion the topic is crucial for advancing our understanding of the evolution of

he abstract and throughout the paper, the authors use the term pitch. This term

duration or intensity of the sound. For this reason, and in the interest of
minological precision, I suggest replacing all instances of pitch with fundamental
quency.
ply: We acknowledge that by convention the term pitch refers to a perceptual
perty and fundamental frequency refers to a measured acoustical property.
e topic of imitation puts us in the terminologically clumsy position of
cussing both perception and production simultaneously. We prefer to retain

nsistent with the literature in which this kind of experiment is reported

unit Hz. Since we have converted our observations to the unit Cents we worry

cessary for our temporally very simple stimuli (each stimulus note was of equal
gth and constant pitch). We agree that time warping might provide an estimate
the best fit for produced melodies with too few/many notes to recover some
ls that we have discarded. Considering the temporal simplicity of the stimuli,
s could also be accomplished by simply allowing the most generous possible
erpretation of produced melodies (i.e., adding blank responses or omitting
ra responses in whichever position minimizes imitation error). However, these
proaches make assumptions that, if incorrect, would contribute to
asurement error. We prefer to lose a small number of observations rather than

ply: We take the general point that since our experiment is related to singing,
t the evolutionary theory that motivates this research is related to speech, we
ould do more to help readers link speech and song. We have added a new
bsection to the discussion section pointing to broad similarities in the
cesses involved in speaking and singing. Elsewhere the reviewer has
ggested that the bit of content related to musical scales might be moved the
roduction, but in light of this new subsection we hope the reviewer will agree
t that content fits best in this new subsection of the discussion (lines 492-407).
e 336: please correct ambiguus
ply: Unfortunately, nucleus ambiguus is the correct spelling of this
atomical term.
e 352: please delete one in (evident in all primates)
ply: Done.
es 357-358: please clarify whats the scope driving the evolution of the ability for
sic. Maybe mention studies on musicality in nonhuman animals, and how that relates
he ability for singing in humans see:

this regard, please make sure to keep the distinction between musicality,
trumental music, vocal music and their evolutionary link to language clear.
ply: The new section on music and language addresses this. We have refrained
m citing empirical work on musicality in non-human animals to avoid a
ression, though we find the review papers that the author has suggested (as
ll as some others) can provide the necessary background. This section also
w establishes what we mean by music and language as frameworks that
mans use to interact or communicate with one another versus song and
eech as the expression of music or language through the voice (lines 393-397).

d not immediately relevant for the purposes of this study. Please consider
thesizing the main point in a couple of sentences.

t detailing the complicated influence of the Thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle, which
agree provided an unnecessary level of detail. (ines 557-559)
