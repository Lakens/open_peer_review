This is a good contribution with a very interesting key finding: not only may comedy be capable
of triggering the endorphin system (as has previously been shown by various authors), but this
also seems to be true for tragic fiction. The paper is well-written and carefully edited, and the key
finding is aptly embedded in the broader area of explaining mechanisms of human social
bonding.
I have added a few (very) minor comments in the attached PDF file. (See Appendix A.)
Furthermore, I would like to suggest adding a few words to clarify the relationship between
'emotional' and 'cognitive' aspects of community bonding. In the Introduction this distinction is
(implicitly) made. It would be helpful if the concluding section follows up on this distinction by
suggesting how the two fit together. Should endorphins be seen as the 'emotional incentive' for
producing and consuming tragic fiction, a practice that--once in place--allows for further
strengthening of community bonds through a shared body of stories and (character-mediated)
world views?
This also forms a natural bridge to the concern of my final comment: any experimental approach
to fiction runs the risk of reducing a very multi-facetted device to one dimension (and in
particular the risk of being told off for this reason by readers who are less used to the
experimental genre). Nothing wrong with a reductive step in principle, but I find it always useful
if this is explicitly acknowledged. I think there are multiple ways in which fiction can cause
emotional arousal (empathising with the characters, trigger personal memories and reflections,
etc.), which seems also reflected in the individual differences in the results. And fiction
potentially has many social roles and functions (two of which are mentioned indeed: endorphin-
mediated bonding and increased sense of community on the cognitive level). Fiction as we now
know it forms a complex and multi-facetted activity, inviting joint research efforts by academics
from disciplines across the sciences and humanities. One remark to this effect, either at the
beginning or end of the paper, would do the job for me.

The authors investigate the effect of observing an emotionally charged film in groups of varying
sizes on changes in pain threshold as an indicator of endorphine level, affect and group
identification.
I find the questions asked as well as the use of an ecological design (naturalistic movies,
presented in a theatre to groups of participants) worthwhile. I do however have a number of
questions regarding the design, the obtained results and their interpretation.
A) Regarding the design:
1) The control group differed from the experimental group in size (and mean age though this
might not be significant) . This is not commented on but seems to be quite an unusual practice
which can be problematic for the statistical inferences.
2) The pain threshold test was administered in groups. Though the authors clearly instructed
participants not to turn this into a competition it is quite naive (especially coming from a group
investigating group dynamics) to assume that the presence of others will not have an effect on the
performance of the task. I will come back to this point in the interpretation of the results
3) Varying group sizes: the authors had the experimental group watch the film in groups of
varying sizes. Nothing is reported regarding the control group and it is not clear if variance of
group size was matched across the two conditions. More importantly, I find it a curious choice to
have the experimental group watch the film in different group sizes. The authors cite no literature
on the topic that motivated their choice but it seem quite intuitive that group size would affect
the extent/nature (quantitatively and/or qualitatively) of group adhesion (as well as modulate
the effect of the group on individual psychological and physiological parameters). I have found a
number of references (Brewer and Kramer 1986, Carron and Spink 1995, Cremer and Leonardelli
2003, Levin and Crowther 2008,swan et al 2012) in the literature that report/theorize an effect of
group size (of course the paradigms are different) on social behavior. Though the results
indicated no differences across group size this could be due to some of the other issues
mentioned below. I would appreciate, at the minimum, an explanation/motivation for the logic
of this choice.
4) The IOS test (btw there is a typo: the original IOS paper is from 92 and not 62): The original
validation of the test, as well as the recent re-validation (Gächter et al 2015) have used this test for
evaluating dyadic relationships (romantic partner in 1992, close friends and acquaintances in
2015). The test here is importantly different as the authors asked the participants to indicate
overlap with the group. In my mind this is a qualitatively different question. The difference needs
to be made clear to the readers and supporting studies from the literature need to be mentioned (I
have found mainly other studies of the same group using this modified version, there as well
without conceptually or empirically clearly motivating the change. Intuitively I would expect that
4
the change from other to others or group should also be reflected in the form of the diagrams
(making the group’s circle larger for exemple). The choice of wording (group, others. other) is
also not innocent and needs to be motivated and reasoned. Importantly, my intuition is that if I
was a subject in this experiment, the size of the group (cf 3 above) would affect my way of
responding to this task (identification with a small group is not the qualitatively the same as the
identification with a larger group).
5) Lack of any 1st person feedback regarding the experiment: This is a great regret given the
design (and the obtained results). It would have been very rich to have some form of
feedback/report from the subjects concerning their experience during the viewing of the film(s).
As the authors discuss in the discussion section, subjective experiences vary considerably and
with no first person reports we are left with a black box situation if we would have liked to
understand what makes certain people exhibit affect, social bonding or pain threshold
differences after viewing and others not. I encourage the authors to include such a component(s)
in future experiments/replcations
B) the obtained results
6) I am missing some graphes such as the relationship between individual change in IOS and
pain threshold and affect changes (we only get one of the three comparisons in figure 4).
7) looking at figure 4, visually it seems that the difference between the left and the right side of
the plot is driven by 5 individuals that seem to exhibit an exceptionally high IOS effect. Is this the
case? or would the results remain the same if we take these 5 individuals out?
8) It will be useful to plot the same results (4a,b,c) for the control condition and to test for effect of
PANAS changes and pain threshold differences on IOS in the control condition too.
9) The authors assume or at least strongly suggest a causal relationship, with pain threshold
changes causing changes in IOS. I am not sure how they arrive at this directionality. If this is
motivated by the statistical tests I would appreciate if this will be clarified
C) Interpretation of the results
10) If causality in (9) is not motivated then pain threshold differences could be due to changes in
social perception. If this directionality is an optional interpretation then unfortunately the point
in (2) becomes a source of a serious confound. It is possible to imagine that change in one’s
perception of group-relatedness will change one’s motivation to stick longer to the task given the
presence of other group members in the same room. Is there anything I am missing that would
eliminate this interpretation? This interpretation makes the supposed ‘pain threshold’ effect just
another consequence of changes in group dynamics and not a measure of hormonal changes.
11) Regarding the PANAS results, the study found a difference between the two conditions only
for changes in negative affect, however, the negative affect was not explanatory of the changes in
IOS (or pain threshold I assume). Given the narrative of the paper, that it is the emotional
reaction to the film that is the source of the hormonal and social bonding changes this is at least
surprising but the authors do not properly address this issue and highlight the relationship
between changes in positive PANAS and IOS. However changes in positive PANAS were not
statistically different across conditions so it is very hard to follow the logic on the relationship
between film type, PANAS and IOS.
For example, does positive PANAS changes predict individual IOS differences in the control
condition? Given that both films produced changes in positive PANAS we would expect IOS to
be affected in both conditions. If it is not, then it is not positive PANAS that is driving changes in
IOS but another factor that remains unknown..
5
In sum, the authors conclude that ‘something’ about the experience of the emotional film (apart
from positive affect changes) caused changes in endorphine level but they /we have no idea what
this something is. There is a host of differences between the movies in the two conditions and a
host of possible differences in ‘ways of engaging with such films. We have no way to tell, given
the used protocol, what is the relevant factor.
Very clearly here, other, more subtle, measures of subjective experience would have come in
very handy. In any case, given the issues of the directionality effects (10) and the lack of clarity
regarding the PANAS results and the lack of a measure mediating film observation and
presumed changes in endorphine levels I cannot follow the authors conclusions from the study.

label_comment_4
I find the additions and changes made in the paper very welcome and useful for the clairty of the
inentions behind, results, and interpretation of the study.
Here are some remaining issues I would think should be addressed for the paper to be ready for
publication:
1) affect vs. emotional response: Thanks to the author’s response to 6 I thought I understood that
they distinguish between an emotional response to the film (that is hypothesized to lead to
changes in pain threshold) and changes in emotional affect after the film that they want to make
sure is not the cause of the changes in pain threshold. This distinction is quite subtle and not well
explained in the introduction. It will be worthwhile to be more explicit about it for readers like
myself for which it is not a-priori evident (as it is, seemingly, to the authors).
I think the discussion is clearer now in this respect but the following sentence brings back the
confusion:
"This may reflect the fact that, like most psychological scales, PANAS is a verbal task and so
probably taps into high-order cognitive reflection that may be unrelated to the more visceral sub-
cortical emotion responses that directly trigger an endorphin response.”
So are affect post-film and emotional response during the film dissociable (as it seems now from
the first part of the discussion) or is it that the PANAS is simply too high level to evaluate the
relevant post film affective changes?
Maybe once again this confusion is due to my naivety concerning the issue of affect vs. "more
visceral sub-cortical emotion" but this could be the case of many of the potential readers so
clarification would be appreciated.
2) I am afraid that my point in (10) was not made clear enough. I will try to be more explicit. Here
is how I understand the logic of the author’s argument:
(a) The target film produces an emotional response not present in the control film,
(b) that emotional response produces via endorphine release
(c) (1) pain threshold changes and
(d) (2) increase in group identification.
Here is an alternative scenario:
(a) the target film, due maybe to its empathic effect (real life story presented in a pseudo-
documentary style) or possibly any other different between it and the control film, produces
(b) a stronger group identification that in turn makes people try to resist longer to the pain
during the threshold experiment (auxiliary hypothesis that sounds reasonable: competition in
this kind of tasks increases with group bonding.)
which brings about
(c) seemingly higher pain threshold results
12
In other words, it is proposed the change observed in the task is not a change in pain threshold
‘per-se’ but an affect on the decision process to stop holding the position due to perceived peer
pressure.
I can easily recall situations in which I persisted in a painful state that I would have otherwise not
prolonged because of the presence of a specific person next to me. This is very different (in my
subjective experience) from other cases where increase in some form of arousal made me less
sensible to pain, for exemple when I dance and ‘forget’ an otherwise painful injury.
And so as a response to the authors question:"then we wonder what the point of the increase in
pain threshold as a consequence of enhanced group bonding actually is – why should the change
in pain threshold be relevant to anything?”
is that they should make an effort to look at the inverse logic to the one they proposed. I
understand that this is not what the authors wanted to study but I am still at odds wrt to their
very strong opinion that their scenario should be more or less self evident and that such an
alternative hypothesis is somehow far fetched or impossible to imagine…
It seems that the authors make too many short cuts which they motivate by primate and other
literature but that remain problematic given the specific film and specific task that were used in
their protocol and that leave too many degrees of liberty in the interpretation.
I consider that the caveat in the discussion regarding their interpretation of the results needs to be
made stronger (their story should be further qualified as only one possible explanation).
3) with respect to the IOS study, I appreciate the clarifications in the text but again I find the
response of the authors to the comments made naive while tending towards dismissive.
Let us start with the difference between group, other and others.
Linguistically group is a collective noun. If I am asked to asses my belonging to the group I will
take the collective as the entity of reference.
When ‘other’ is used, it means a specific singular person.
My intuition (shared by a number of persons I have asked) is that when I am asked to use two
circles to represent my relationship to a group it would be an inclusion relation (where a spatial
analogy would be ‘the chair is inside the house but the car is not inside the house). However,
when I am asked (as in the original and standardized version of the IOS) to use two circles to
represent me and another person I interpret the question as a question of (self) identification. I
don’t see how these two are the same in anyway.
I am happy for the authors to use a diagram as a test for group inclusion but I find it problematic
to present it as a natural extension of a personal identification test.
If, as they make clear, they don’t think that such a scale , being so intuitive and simple, requires
any form of validation then why cite a validation study for (what I consider to be, and with no
evidence to the contrary will remain convinced to be) a different measure as a reference?
N.B. Other studies used ‘others’ which is ambiguous as plurals often are, between a collective and
distributive reading and so could elicit one of the two reasonings above or a mixe of both.
Also, can the authors be more specific as to the exact instruction given to the participants ?
I wonder if the authors took the time to ask (at least few) subjects what they meant by their
drawings (some explicitaiton is always a good start to understand underlying mechanisms)
4) Reflecting on the authors response to my last point and to review 3: I am a trained linguist and
nearo-linguist and I find it highly problematic when non-linguist researchers make gross
oversimplifications in psycho or neurolinguisitic studies (for exemple comparing verbs to nouns)
in the name of intuition, ignoring the highly complex differences (well documented in the expert
literature) across and within the classes they chose to study . The situation here is analogous. The
13
authors, which are not (I believe) specialists in aesthetics (and in particular the sub field of
durational art) seem very comfortable to use two films that differ on many (well studied by the
relevant discipline) aspects and to claim that the relevant difference is the one they decide on,
using their naive (non-expert) intuition.
Apart from being disrespectful to an existing field of knowledge and expertises, this is
particularly problematic here as I have briefly proposed above that other features of the target
film could have provided another explanation to the observed effect not passing through the
critical-to-the-authors endorphin releasing step. The last paragraph written in response to
reviewer 1 and 3’s points should, to my mind, be clearer on this point.

Comments to the Author(s)
I find the additions and changes made in the paper very welcome and useful for the clairty of the
inentions behind, results, and interpretation of the study.
Here are some remaining issues I would think should be addressed for the paper to be ready for
publication:
1) affect vs. emotional response: Thanks to the author’s response to 6 I thought I understood that
they distinguish between an emotional response to the film (that is hypothesized to lead to
changes in pain threshold) and changes in emotional affect after the film that they want to make
sure is not the cause of the changes in pain threshold. This distinction is quite subtle and not well
explained in the introduction. It will be worthwhile to be more explicit about it for readers like
myself for which it is not a-priori evident (as it is, seemingly, to the authors).
I think the discussion is clearer now in this respect but the following sentence brings back the
confusion:
"This may reflect the fact that, like most psychological scales, PANAS is a verbal task and so
probably taps into high-order cognitive reflection that may be unrelated to the more visceral sub-
cortical emotion responses that directly trigger an endorphin response.”
So are affect post-film and emotional response during the film dissociable (as it seems now from
the first part of the discussion) or is it that the PANAS is simply too high level to evaluate the
relevant post film affective changes?
16
Maybe once again this confusion is due to my naivety concerning the issue of affect vs. "more
visceral sub-cortical emotion" but this could be the case of many of the potential readers so
clarification would be appreciated.
2) I am afraid that my point in (10) was not made clear enough. I will try to be more explicit. Here
is how I understand the logic of the author’s argument:
(a) The target film produces an emotional response not present in the control film,
(b) that emotional response produces via endorphine release
(c) (1) pain threshold changes and
(d) (2) increase in group identification.
Here is an alternative scenario:
(a) the target film, due maybe to its empathic effect (real life story presented in a pseudo-
documentary style) or possibly any other different between it and the control film, produces
(b) a stronger group identification that in turn makes people try to resist longer to the pain
during the threshold experiment (auxiliary hypothesis that sounds reasonable: competition in
this kind of tasks increases with group bonding.)
which brings about
(c) seemingly higher pain threshold results
In other words, it is proposed the change observed in the task is not a change in pain threshold
‘per-se’ but an affect on the decision process to stop holding the position due to perceived peer
pressure.
I can easily recall situations in which I persisted in a painful state that I would have otherwise not
prolonged because of the presence of a specific person next to me. This is very different (in my
subjective experience) from other cases where increase in some form of arousal made me less
sensible to pain, for exemple when I dance and ‘forget’ an otherwise painful injury.
And so as a response to the authors question:"then we wonder what the point of the increase in
pain threshold as a consequence of enhanced group bonding actually is – why should the change
in pain threshold be relevant to anything?”
is that they should make an effort to look at the inverse logic to the one they proposed. I
understand that this is not what the authors wanted to study but I am still at odds wrt to their
very strong opinion that their scenario should be more or less self evident and that such an
alternative hypothesis is somehow far fetched or impossible to imagine…
It seems that the authors make too many short cuts which they motivate by primate and other
literature but that remain problematic given the specific film and specific task that were used in
their protocol and that leave too many degrees of liberty in the interpretation.
I consider that the caveat in the discussion regarding their interpretation of the results needs to be
made stronger (their story should be further qualified as only one possible explanation).
3) with respect to the IOS study, I appreciate the clarifications in the text but again I find the
response of the authors to the comments made naive while tending towards dismissive.
Let us start with the difference between group, other and others.
Linguistically group is a collective noun. If I am asked to asses my belonging to the group I will
take the collective as the entity of reference.
When ‘other’ is used, it means a specific singular person.
My intuition (shared by a number of persons I have asked) is that when I am asked to use two
circles to represent my relationship to a group it would be an inclusion relation (where a spatial
17
analogy would be ‘the chair is inside the house but the car is not inside the house). However,
when I am asked (as in the original and standardized version of the IOS) to use two circles to
represent me and another person I interpret the question as a question of (self) identification. I
don’t see how these two are the same in anyway.
I am happy for the authors to use a diagram as a test for group inclusion but I find it problematic
to present it as a natural extension of a personal identification test.
If, as they make clear, they don’t think that such a scale , being so intuitive and simple, requires
any form of validation then why cite a validation study for (what I consider to be, and with no
evidence to the contrary will remain convinced to be) a different measure as a reference?
N.B. Other studies used ‘others’ which is ambiguous as plurals often are, between a collective and
distributive reading and so could elicit one of the two reasonings above or a mixe of both.
Also, can the authors be more specific as to the exact instruction given to the participants ?
I wonder if the authors took the time to ask (at least few) subjects what they meant by their
drawings (some explicitaiton is always a good start to understand underlying mechanisms)
4) Reflecting on the authors response to my last point and to review 3: I am a trained linguist and
nearo-linguist and I find it highly problematic when non-linguist researchers make gross
oversimplifications in psycho or neurolinguisitic studies (for exemple comparing verbs to nouns)
in the name of intuition, ignoring the highly complex differences (well documented in the expert
literature) across and within the classes they chose to study . The situation here is analogous. The
authors, which are not (I believe) specialists in aesthetics (and in particular the sub field of
durational art) seem very comfortable to use two films that differ on many (well studied by the
relevant discipline) aspects and to claim that the relevant difference is the one they decide on,
using their naive (non-expert) intuition.
Apart from being disrespectful to an existing field of knowledge and expertises, this is
particularly problematic here as I have briefly proposed above that other features of the target
film could have provided another explanation to the observed effect not passing through the
critical-to-the-authors endorphin releasing step. The last paragraph written in response to
reviewer 1 and 3’s points should, to my mind, be clearer on this point.

4
5 25 Drama, whether in the form of storytelling or plays, has a particular attraction for us: we
6
7
26 repeatedly return to it and are willing to invest money and time in doing so. Why this is so
8
9
10 27 remains an evolutionary enigma that has never been explored. We hypothesise that drama,
11
12 28 and in particular emotionally arousing drama, triggers the same mechanism (the endorphin
13
14 29 system, reflected in increased pain thresholds) that underpins anthropoid primate and human
15
16 30 social bonding. We show that, compared to subjects who watch an emotionally neutral film,
17
18
19 31 subjects who watch an emotionally arousing film have increased pain thresholds and an
20
21 32 increased sense of group-bonding.

3 37 Introduction
4
5 38 Drama, and storytelling more generally, is an important feature of human society,
6
7
39 common to all cultures. Though widely studied in the humanities, the reasons why we
8
9
10 40 become so engrossed in fiction, and the likely functions for this, have attracted very little
11
12 41 attention from either psychologists or behavioural biologists. Yet it is evident that people are
13
14 42 willing to spend a great deal of time, and often money, to be entertained in this way, whether
15
16 43 casually in social contexts or formally in the theatre or cinema, thereby incurring significant
17
18
19 44 costs. Storytelling forms a major component of evening conversations around the campfire in
20
21 45 hunter-gatherer societies [1], and enables us to pass on, in the form of origins stories or a
22
23 46 corpus of commonly held folktales and folk knowledge, the cultural ideologies that create the
24
25 47 sense of community: shared knowledge forms part of the mechanism that binds friends [2-5]
26
27
48 as well as communities [6-7].
28
29
30 49 As important as these cognitive aspects of storytelling may be for community
31
32 50 bonding, they do not explain why we are willing to return again and again to be entertained
33
34 51 by storytellers and dramatists. One plausible explanation for our enjoyment of comedy might
35
36 52 be that comedy makes us laugh, and laughter activates the endorphin system [8-11], thereby
37
38
39 53 providing a sense of reward and pleasure. Endorphins act as analgesics and increase tolerance
40
41 54 of pain [12], being involved in well known phenomena like the ‘runner’s high’ [13]. As a
42
43 55 result, comedy that makes us laugh out loud results in an increase in pain threshold (8-10).
44
45 56 But why should we be just as engaged by emotionally stirring plots that “reduce us to tears”
46
47
57 (i.e. tragedies)? One possibility is that the emotional arousal triggered by such stories also
48
49
50 58 activates the endorphin system, because the same areas of the brain that support or respond to
51
52 59 physical pain are also involved in psychological pain [14-17]. There is now an extensive
53
54 60 literature suggesting that social rejection or viewing emotionally-valenced pictures, and even
55
56 61 just musically induced mood change, elevate pain thresholds, thereby seeming to allow
57
58

1
2
3 62 subjects to attenuate their responses to negative emotional experiences [18-2122]. There is
4
5 63 even some suggestion that watching dramatic tragedy may increase pain threshold [9].
6
7
64 Endorphins are part of the brain’s pain management system [12,23-26] and play a
8
9
10 65 central role in social bonding in anthropoid primates [27-30]. This latter effect is normally
11
12 66 mediated through the afferent c-tactile (CT) neural system [31] by light stroking during social
13
14 67 grooming, and PET imaging has confirmed that the same behaviour activates the endorphin
15
16 68 system in humans [32]. It seems that a number of other social activities, including laughter
17
18
19 69 [8], singing [33] and dancing [34], also activate this system and, through this, enhance the
20
21 70 sense of bonding to the other individuals present in a group.
22
23 71 We used live audiences to test the hypothesis that emotionally rousing drama triggers
24
25 72 an endorphin response (indexed by change in pain threshold) and, through this, increases the
26
27
73 sense of belonging to the group (social bonding).
28
29
30 74
31
32 75 Methods
33
34 76 We used an emotionally intense made-for-TV film (Stuart: A Life Backwards; 90
35
36 77 mins), based on a real-life personal story [35]. The film portrays the life story of Stuart, a
37
38
39 78 disabled, homeless, child abuse survivor, often in harrowing detail, and provides a disturbing
40
41 79 insight into how a disabled child could end up being driven to prison, drugs, hopelessness, a
42
43 80 life on the streets and eventual suicide. In all, 169 participants (101 females; mean age =
44
45 81 24.8±10.2 years, range 18-72) watched the film in a small theatre environment in groups of
46
47
82 varying size (mean 26.1±16.8SD, range 2-49). As a control condition, 68 participants (42
48
49
50 83 females; mean age=29.7±12.3 years) watched two documentaries (The Museum of Life -
51
52 84 Episode One [BBC, 2010; 60 mins] and Landscape Mysteries: In Search of Irish Gold [BBC,
53 Were they randomly assigned to these
54 85 2008; 30 mins]) in a continuous back-to-back presentation. conditions? (So I assume they only heard about
55 the higher payment in the boring condition
56 afterwards?)

3 86 While we tried to ensure that participants did not watch the film with friends, it was
4
5 87 not possible to ensure that they were wholly unfamiliar with the other members of their
6
7
88 assigned group. Of the 169 participants in the experimental group, 74 (44%) stated that they
8
9
10 89 did not recognise anyone in their group, and 133 (74%) stated that they recognised no more
11
12 90 than one person. Only 13 participants (8%) recognised more than two other people in their
13
14 91 group, and all but one of these were in large groups.
15
16 92 After signing a written consent form, participants completed 1) the Inclusion-of-Other-in-
17
18
19 93 Self scale (IOS [36]) (where, for present purposes, ‘other’ referred to the group with whom
20
21 94 they watched the film, and thus functioned as an index of group-belonging or bonding), 2) the
22
23 95 short PANAS affect scale providing separate indices for positive and negative affect [37], and
24
25 96 3) a pain threshold assay. Participants then watched the assigned film (for 90 mins), and
26
27
97 finally repeated all three tasks (IOS, PANAS and pain threshold). The psychological scales
28
29
30 98 were 7-point Likert self-rating scales. In each case, our measure is the change in a variable
31
32 99 indexed as after-minus-before.
33
34 100 Endorphins do not cross the blood-brain barrier [37-39], and hence can be assayed
35
36 101 directly only with difficulty (conventionally, by lumbar puncture or by PET scanning, neither
37
38
39 102 of which is practical for live audiences). Because endorphins have strong natural analgesic
40
41 103 properties and play a crucial role in the modulation of pain (12,23-26), we followed common
42
43 104 practice and used changes in pain threshold as an assay for endorphin activation. As a pain
44
45 105 threshold assay, we used a standard skiing exercise, the wall-sit test (also known as the
46
47
106 Roman Chair), and measured how long a participant could sit unsupported with the back
48
49
50 107 against a wall [41-43]; the position becomes increasingly painful the longer it is held until the
51
52 108 individual cannot sustain it any longer and falls to the ground. In this respect, it has some
53
54 109 advantages over other more conventional pain assays, such as ischaemic pain, cold pressor or
55
56 110 algometers in that it is less open to subjective definitions of ‘painful’. Participants were

3 111 always tested in groups of 4 or 5, and were retested post-experiment in the same group. On
4
5 112 each occasion, they were reminded that “…this is not a competition, but try to hold the pose
6
7
113 for as long as you possibly can. Please ignore what everyone else is doing.” Indeed, there was
8
9
10 114 no significant difference in change in pain threshold across groups of different size in the
11
12 115 experimental condition (F2,120=0.38, p=0.683).
13
14 116 One participant chose not to perform the wall-sit task and one participant failed to
15
16 117 complete the IOS task after watching the film in the experimental condition. Because of the
17
18
19 118 time required to do the wall-sit tests, we randomly sampled only half of the participants in
20
21 119 large groups (47 out of the 92 subjects in groups larger than 20) in the experimental
22
23 120 condition.
24
25 121 In the experimental condition, there was no effect of viewing group size on any of the
26
27
122 four variables (change in pain threshold, whether indexed as absolute or relative change:
28
29
30 123 F2,120=0.38, p=0.683 and F2,120=0.36, p=0.696, respectively; change in IOS: F2,165=1.41,
31
32 124 p=0.248; change in positive PANAS: F2,166=2.21, p=0.113; change in negative PANAS:
33
34 125 F2,166=0.09, p=0.916). Group size is thus unlikely to be a confound in any of the analyses, and
35
36 126 is therefore excluded from all of them. Although none of the variables differed significantly
37
38
39 127 from normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, p>0.05), 4 individual scores on the pain threshold
40
41 128 and IOS were more than 3 standard deviations from their respective means (see Fig. 2), and
42
43 129 these values were excluded from all analyses except for the distributional analyses (Figs. 1
44
45 130 and 2). Note that in the case of the experimental condition our hypothesis is explicitly
46
47
131 directional: a significant reduction in pain threshold after watching the film Stuart would be
48
49
50 132 at least as strong evidence against the hypothesis as a non-significant result. Where we test
51
52 133 for an explicit directional change, 1-tailed statistical tests are appropriate. In all other cases,
53
54 134 we use 2-tailed tests.

18
19 142 As a manipulation check, we first determined whether participants had been
20
21 143 emotionally affected by the two films. We ran mixed models on the two PANAS variables
22
23 144 (positive and negative affect), with the condition (Stuart vs control films) as a between-
24
25 145 subjects effect and change in PANAS score (before to after) and the PANAS*condition
26
27
146 interaction as a within-subjects effects. There was a significant change in both PANAS scores
28
29
30 147 after watching the films (positive PANAS: F1,234=26.1, p<0.001, <U+03B7>=0.10; negative PANAS:
31
32 148 F1,234=31.5, p<0.001, <U+03B7>=0.12), but only in the case of negative PANAS was there an effect of
33
34 149 condition (Stuart vs control) (positive: F1,234=1.88, p=0.172, <U+03B7>=0.01; negative: F1,234=47.0,
35
36 150 p<0.001, <U+03B7>=0.17) or an interaction effect (positive: F1,234=0.02, p=0.887, <U+03B7>=0.00; negative:
37
38
39 151 F1,234=68.1, p<0.001, <U+03B7>=0.23). In effect, watching Stuart resulted in a significant reduction in
40
41 152 positive affect (Fig. 1a; mean change <U+2206>=-1.36: matched pairs t-tests, t128=-4.98, p<0.0001)
42
43 153 and a very substantial increase in negative affect (Fig. 1b; mean <U+2206>=+2.75: t128=-11.66,
44
45 154 p<0.00001), whereas watching the control film produced significant, albeit modest,
46
47
155 reductions in both positive affect (Fig. 1a; mean <U+2206>=-1.37: t67=-2.61, p=0.011) and negative
48
49
50 156 affect (Fig. 1b; mean <U+2206>=-0.47: t67=-2.25, p=0.028). The responses to the two films thus
51
52 157 differed considerably, with the experimental film Stuart inducing a strong negative response
53
54 158 whereas the control films induced only a modest change (most likely due to boredom). The
55
56 159 films clearly had the effect we expected them to have.

4
5 161 threshold from before to after watching the film, and the equivalent change in IOS) for the
6
7
162 two films. Neither baseline (pre-film) pain threshold nor baseline IOS differed significantly
8
9
10 163 between the two conditions (pain: F1,188=0.85, p=0.359; IOS: F1,235=0.14, p=0.711). Although
11
12 164 not everyone responded positively, both variables were significantly greater than zero for the
13 what is meant by 'responding positively' here? Is that both IOS and pain threshold going up? Please disambiguate
14 165 experimental group (directional tests, paired samples t-tests: p=0.010 1-tailed), with no effect
15
16 166 due to group size (pain: F2,115=0.99, p=0.374; IOS: F2,160=1.56, p=0.214 2-tailed tests) or sex
17
18
19 167 (pain: F1,115=1.02, p=0.314; IOS: F2,160=0.003, p=0.955 2-tailed tests). In contrast, the control
20
21 168 group did not differ significantly from zero on either measure (p=0.558 2-tailed). The average
22
23 169 increase in pain threshold after watching Stuart is an increase +13.1±49.1% of the baseline
24
25 170 (pre-viewing) threshold. The equivalent value for the control films is a decrease of -
26
27
171 4.6±43.1% of baseline (an effect noted in all control groups in previous studies using pain
28
29
30 172 assays [10,33,34]).
31
32 173 We used a mixed model GLM to compare responses for the two films directly, with
33
34 174 timing (pre- vs post-film, so as to control for pre-film baseline pain threshold) and film type
35
36 175 (Stuart vs control) as main effects and a directional interaction effect as the crucial test. In
37
38
39 176 respect of pain threshold, there was no main effect of timing (F1,188=0.63, p=0.428) or film
40
41 177 (F1,188=0.07, p=0.789) but, importantly, there was a significant timing*film interaction in the
42
43 178 predicted direction (F1,188=3.37, p=0.034). The contrast between the two conditions is evident
44
45 179 in their marginal means, with pain threshold declining after watching the control film (as is
46
47
180 commonly the case [8]) but increasing dramatically in the experimental (Stuart) condition
48 why here ref 8 and in former paragraph 10,33,34 to same e<U+FB00>ect?
49
50 181 (Fig. 3a). For the IOS group-bonding index, there was a significant main effect of timing (in
51
52 182 general, IOS was higher after watching any film: F1,233=5.71, p=0.018) but not of film type
53
54 183 (F1,233=0.12, p=0.199), and, again, there was a significant timing*film interaction in the
55
56 184 predicted direction (F1,233=4.32, p=0.020) (Fig. 2b). The marginal means show a strong

6
7
187 Plotting change in pain threshold against change in IOS for the experimental group
8
9
10 188 (Fig. 4) yields a distribution that, of the equations available in SPSS, is best fitted within the
11
12 189 observed range by a cubic regression with a rising right hand tail (F3,115=3.35, r2=0.08,
13
14 190 p=0.022; best fit linear equation: F1,117=3.38, r2=0.028, p=0.069), indicating that the
15
16 191 relationship is likely to have a nonlinear rather than a linear form. Inspection of the data
17
18
19 192 suggests that change in IOS is asymptotic on the left hand side of the graph below
20
21 193 approximately <U+2206> pain = 0, but increases linearly on the right hand side. Partitioning at
22
23 194 successive pain thresholds and fitting separate linear regressions to the left and right halves of
24
25 195 the resulting graph (Fig. 5) suggests that, irrespective of where the break-point is placed, the
26
27
196 left hand side never differs from a slope = 0 (0.226=p=0.916), whereas the right hand side has
28
29
30 197 a significantly positive linear fit for all splits between approximately -24 = <U+2206> pain = +17
31
32 198 (where 0.009=p=0.0.036). This suggests that not all subjects responded emotionally to the
33
34 199 experimental film Stuart, and hence showed neither an increase in pain threshold nor an
35
36 200 increase in bondedness; but those that did respond exhibited a linear increase in bondedness
37
38
39 201 that was proportional to their increase in pain threshold.
40
41 202 We used path analysis of the data for Stuart to determine whether this relationship
42
43 203 might simply be due to changes in affect. We considered change after watching the film for
44
45 204 the four key variables (pain threshold, IOS, and positive and negative affect), with a 1-tailed
46
47
205 effect of Pain on IOS, and 2-tailed effects in all other cases. We considered six alternative
48
49
50 206 models, all of which included the effect of change in positive affect and pain threshold on
51
52 207 IOS (group bondedness). A comparison of maximum likelihoods yields a best fit model in
53
54 208 which change in positive affect and change in pain threshold independently influence change
55
56 209 in IOS, with no other significant effects (Fig. 6) (Fisher’s C=22.003; all other models

3 210 C=16.145). The values against the solid arrow give the standardised slopes for these two
4
5 211 effects. Note that although the standardised ß for pain threshold is lower than that for positive
6
7
212 affect, the model considers only linear relationships whereas Fig. 4 shows that the
8
9
10 213 relationship with IOS is actually non-linear; a poorer fit is therefore to be expected. Changes
11
12 214 in negative affect have no influence on either pain threshold or IOS, and neither positive nor
13
14 215 negative affect had any influence on pain threshold. Notice that positive affect and pain
15
16 216 threshold both influence IOS in the same direction: the greater the pain response and the
17
18
19 217 greater the positive affect the higher is the sense of group bonding. Since pain threshold
20
21 218 increases and positive affect decreases when exposed to this emotionally intense stimulus
22
23 219 (Figs. 1 and 2), this makes it clear that these two variables are acting independently of each
24
25 220 other and in opposite directions.
26
27
221
28
29
30 222 Discussion
31
32 223 We have shown that both pain threshold and sense of bondedness to the group
33
34 224 increase after watching an emotionally rousing film, but not after watching films of the same
35
36 225 length that have no emotional content. The path analysis also allowed us to conclude that this
37
38
39 226 relationship is independent of the change in affect, and hence, by implication, that it is the
40
41 227 increase in pain threshold that is driving the change in IOS and not the other way around.
42
43 228 Given the extensive neurophysiological evidence for a close relationship between pain
44
45 229 tolerance and endorphins [12, 23-26] and the fact that changes in pain threshold following
46
47
230 laughter are also associated with endorphin activation [11], we interpret the increase in pain
48
49
50 231 threshold as indicating endorphin uptake.
51
52 232 Our experiment thus yields three important results. First, while in general there was
53
54 233 an increase in pain threshold after watching Stuart, not everyone shows this: some people
55
56 234 were unmoved by the film, and these individuals did not exhibit any change in bondedness to
57
58
59

1
2
3 235 the group. The mean change in pain threshold for those who exhibited a positive change was
4
5 236 20.8±21.3 secs, compared to a decrease of -18.5±15.6 secs for those exhibiting a negative
6
7
237 change. The latter value is of similar magnitude to that seen in the control conditions of other
8
9
10 238 experiments when endorphin receptors are not up-regulated [10]. This contrast between those
11 see earlier point––ref to 8?
12 239 who respond to a drama and those who don’t is in keeping with everyday experience: not all
13
14 240 of an audience has the same experience of a film or play. Second, for those who did respond,
15
16 241 this increase in pain threshold is associated with, or gives rise to, a heightened sense of
17
18
19 242 belonging to the group (group bonding). Importantly, Fig. 4 makes it clear that those who do
20
21 243 not respond with endorphin activation do not exhibit any change in their sense of group
22
23 244 bonding. Third, the path analysis of Fig. 6 confirms that the sense of belonging to the group
24
25 245 that is indexed by the IOS is independently influenced by both changes in positive affect and
26
27
246 by changes in pain threshold (i.e. endorphins). Since the two variables have opposite effects,
28
29
30 247 this suggests that pain threshold changes are determined by some aspect of our emotional
31
32 248 response to drama other than affect (at least as reflected in the PANAS scales). Since the
33
34 249 PANAS scales are verbal, they probably tap into high order cognitive reflection that may be
35
36 250 unrelated to the more visceral sub-cortical emotion responses that may feed directly into the
37
38
39 251 brain’s pain perception centres and trigger an endorphin response.
40
41 252 The fact that watching emotionally wrenching drama increases the sense of belonging
42
43 253 to the group suggests that our enthusiasm for this form of storytelling might have evolved in
44
45 254 the context of bonding social groups. We suggest that this effect probably extends both to
46
47
255 listening to stories as well as watching filmed or staged dramas, whenever doing so arouses a
48
49
50 256 strong emotional response. In this respect, storytelling might be seen as supplementing other
51
52 257 social mechanisms (laughter, singing, dancing), all of which seem to have very similar
53
54 258 endorphin activating effects [9,10,33,34] and all of which enhance group social bonding
55
56 259 [33,34,44]. As forms of grooming-at-a-distance, their function seems to be to break through

Appendix B
Comments to the author(s) :
Although I am very interested in experimental studies, I first come from the field of aesthetics
nd phenomenology, also, my comments relate essentially to the design of the study rather
han statistical analysis.
Globaly this study is innovative and we appreciate that it is conducted in ecological context,
s well as the choices of a before­after design and to cross the different tasks.
1/ Our first remarks regards the selection of films that is not trivial. Aesthetic studies remind
us that each artistic work is complex and that the emotions are here at play in an aesthetic
ontext (Schaeffer).
The emotional content of the film itself is modulated by the artistic choices : the
nterpretation of the actors (neutral, realistic, tragic burlesque ...), the representation of
motions (presence or absence of tears, strengthening or not by the music etc), managing the
pace of action, suspense, tension, etc. The film is described as a high emotional value
ompared to control films, but above all they do not belong to the same category. If it is
difficult to quantify the emotional content of one film, we regret that no detailed aesthetic
nalysis has been made.
The art work’s style influences the absorption (Fried) and distanciation (Brecht) of the
viewer : we do not implicate ourselves in fiction as we do in a documentary. From a
phenomenological and aesthetic point of view, fiction explicitly based on "facts" is a special
ase (Schaeffer).Very fashionable at the moment, it has the effect of increasing the
dentification of spectators. We even think that the reference in the introduction of the film
based on real events" changes the way to engage in the movie. (That is another question, but
n the field of neuroesthetics, it would be interesting to study how such an introduction affects
he spectator.)
n this vein, by doing the skiing exercise task, it seemed that it reflects not only the pain
olerance threshold but it is also an exercise of will. But from the short description of the film
made by the authors, it seems that the hero of the film is not a typical example of the
phenomenon of "resilience" (Ruffo) that would transcend the trials. Rather pathos seems to
be very pronounced in this film. We wonder if the results of this task would not have been
different with a film in which the hero meets challenges and surpasses, even with a strong
motional content.
We regret that basic notions from the field of aesthetics about the “theories of the viewer” are
gnored. They could enrich the process of elaboration of the experimental design.
2 / Our second observation concerns the choice of questionnaires and tasks :
Given what we have said above and the question of pain threshold and social bonding, we
egret that no questionnaire about empathy and / or adherence to fiction is given to spectators.
We think, for example, of the questionnaire IRI (Interpersonal Reactivity Index), which
ontains several issues related to adherence to fiction.
On the other hand, no argument is provided for the use of IOS questionnaire to study group
dherence. Yet it is not clear that it can be transposed from a dyadic relationship to
elationship to a group without being transformed.
Especially we regret the lack of questionnaire about the experience in first person of the
participants. This point is reinforced by the results of the study. They show that there is a
hange of negative affect after spectating the film, but this change is not correlated with the
hange of the resistance threshold to pain and group membership. Moreover, it is really
nteresting that two groups of spectators emerge after spectating the film: those for whom
here is a positive change, and those for whom there is a negative change. (It's a shame not to
have anticipated that there will be individual differences when it seems obvious to the authors
n their conclusion). As it is done in neurophenomenology, the results in first person
perspective could have provided insight to better guide the analysis of results: the two group
of spectators, and the absence of correlation between change in the negativ affect and change
n pain threshold and social bonding.e
3/ Our third point relates to the results and their interpretation. Interpretation of the results is
not always clear to us. We fail to make the link between the chart and the directionality
proposed by the authors : that is the increase in pain threshold that drive the change in IOS :
The path analysis also allowed us to conclude that this relationship is independent of the
hange in affect, and hence, by implication, that it is the increase in pain threshold that is
driving the change in IOS and not the other way around”. Perhaps the authors could better
describe their thinking and how they arrive at that conclusion from their results.
Orthography :
First line of the discussion, it is says “rousing” instead of “arousing”.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a good contribution with a very interesting key
finding: not only may comedy be capable of triggering the
endorphin system (as has previously been shown by various
authors), but this also seems to be true for tragic
fiction. The paper is well-written and carefully edited,
and the key finding is aptly embedded in the broader area
of explaining mechanisms of human social bonding.
PDF file.
l. 85: more detail now added to Methods.
l. 164: now disambiguated.
l. 181: the reference here is to a series of studies in
which subjects watched a film; refs 33-34 refer to
experiments in which subjects sing or dance, and
therefore is a rather different task.
l. 238: reference added.
Furthermore, I would like to suggest adding a few words
to clarify the relationship between 'emotional' and
'cognitive' aspects of community bonding. In the
Introduction this distinction is (implicitly) made. It
would be helpful if the concluding section follows up on
this distinction by suggesting how the two fit together.
Should endorphins be seen as the 'emotional incentive'
for producing and consuming tragic fiction, a practice
that--once in place--allows for further strengthening of
community bonds through a shared body of stories and
(character-mediated) world views?
This also forms a natural bridge to the concern of my
final comment: any experimental approach to fiction runs
the risk of reducing a very multi-facetted device to one
dimension (and in particular the risk of being told off
for this reason by readers who are less used to the
experimental genre). Nothing wrong with a reductive step
in principle, but I find it always useful if this is
explicitly acknowledged. I think there are multiple ways
in which fiction can cause emotional arousal (empathising
with the characters, trigger personal memories and
reflections, etc.), which seems also reflected in the
individual differences in the results. And fiction
potentially has many social roles and functions (two of
which are mentioned indeed: endorphin-mediated bonding
and increased sense of community on the cognitive level).
Fiction as we now know it forms a complex and multi-
facetted activity, inviting joint research efforts by
academics from disciplines across the sciences and
humanities. One remark to this effect, either at the
beginning or end of the paper, would do the job for me.
A final paragraph making this important point has now
been added.

Reviewer: 2
The authors investigate the effect of observing an
emotionally charged film in groups of varying sizes on
changes in pain threshold as an indicator of endorphine
level, affect and group identification.
I find the questions asked as well as the use of an
ecological design (naturalistic movies, presented in a
theatre to groups of participants) worthwhile. I do
however have a number of questions regarding the design,
the obtained results and their interpretation.
A) Regarding the design:
1) The control group differed from the experimental group
in size (and mean age though this might not be
significant) . This is not commented on but seems to be
quite an unusual practice which can be problematic for
the statistical inferences.
i. In the original text (Methods, l.137), we stated
that there was no effect of group size on any of
the dependent variables. We had also included
group size as a covariate in the main analysis
(where its effect was non-significant). Given
this, we are not entirely sure why the referee
thinks group size might affect the results.
ii. Nonetheless, we checked to see whether considering
only the data from groups of the similar size in
the two conditions would change the results. It
does not.
iii. Let us be clear: if there had been an effect of
group size, we would have been particularly
interested in it for theoretical reasons related
to social bonding. However, in this case, no group
size effect was present, and there seems little to
be gained by considering it further in this
particular context because it would distract
attention unnecessarily away from the substantive
point of the paper. We simply want to be able to
control for it to be sure (which is why it is
consigned to an aside in the Methods).
We have now made this explicit in the text.
2) The pain threshold test was administered in groups.
Though the authors clearly instructed participants not to
turn this into a competition it is quite naive
(especially coming from a group investigating group
dynamics) to assume that the presence of others will not
have an effect on the performance of the task. I will
come back to this point in the interpretation of the
results
to be as competitive as possible, so as not to drop out
too soon. Although we did not frame it as a competition,
we explicitly asked subjects to hold the position as long
as possible, so their competitiveness should be maximised
if it is there at all. This task has been used in a
number of studies and there is no evidence to suggest
that this issue has ever biased the results in any way:
we get the same results even when subjects perform in
private (see citations in text).
That said, perhaps the substantive issue is that this was
a within-subjects analysis, so even if some subjects
behaved very competitively, this should not affect the
results. The bottom line is the comparison between an
increase in the experimental condition and a decrease in
the control condition. This is not what you would predict
if competition was solely responsible for any effect.
Nonetheless, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion
to address this issue.
3) Varying group sizes: the authors had the experimental
group watch the film in groups of varying sizes. Nothing
is reported regarding the control group and it is not
clear if variance of group size was matched across the
two conditions. More importantly, I find it a curious
choice to have the experimental group watch the film in
different group sizes. The authors cite no literature on
the topic that motivated their choice but it seem quite
intuitive that group size would affect the extent/nature
(quantitatively and/or qualitatively) of group adhesion
(as well as modulate the effect of the group on
individual psychological and physiological parameters). I
have found a number of references (Brewer and Kramer
1986, Carron and Spink 1995, Cremer and Leonardelli 2003,
Levin and Crowther 2008,swan et al 2012) in the
literature that report/theorize an effect of group size
(of course the paradigms are different) on social
behavior. Though the results indicated no differences
across group size this could be due to some of the other
issues mentioned below. I would appreciate, at the
minimum, an explanation/motivation for the logic of this
choice.
This might well seem plausible taken at face value, but
there was no effect of group size on any dependent
variable. Even if one excludes the data from very small
and large groups, it doesn't affect the results.
This may be an untidy design, but it is a sacrifice we
had to make for practical reasons. For logistical
there were no group size effects at all, it was decided,
when we came to run the control groups, to do so with
groups of average size (getting up to 50 people to
remember to turn up at the same time for an experiment is
no mean feat). We have smaller control groups in other
experiments, and they do not behave differently to those
in the present experiment.
We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to these
papers. It is indeed well known that there is a group
effect on moral dilemma and public good (or stranger
intervention) tasks, all of which are intensely and
explicitly social and subject to peer pressure effects.
We do not use these kinds of tasks, but in any case these
studies invariably find effects that are in the opposite
direction (small groups favour greater sense of
belonging). More importantly, we do not use any kind of
decision task. We simply ask: do you feel more or less
part of the group that you watched the film with? Since
this judgement was made in private, it is difficult to
imagine any convincing reason why the size of the group
might have influenced participants’ decisions differently
in one film than in the other (unless it had something to
do with the film, which is the whole point of the study).
We also asked them to do a task for which there was no
reward, no outcome and no group benefit. These are
strangers -- most will never see each other again.
Finally, we note that the experiments cited in these
papers suggest that group size effects asymptote at
groups of about 8 individuals: almost all our groups were
much larger than this.
For the final comment, see our response to (1) above.
4) The IOS test (btw there is a typo: the original IOS
paper is from 92 and not 62):
Thanks for noticing: now corrected.
The original validation of the test, as well as the
recent re-validation (Gächter et al 2015) have used this
test for evaluating dyadic relationships (romantic
partner in 1992, close friends and acquaintances in
2015). The test here is importantly different as the
authors asked the participants to indicate overlap with
the group. In my mind this is a qualitatively different
question. The difference needs to be made clear to the
readers and supporting studies from the literature need
to be mentioned (I have found mainly other studies of the
same group using this modified version, there as well
without conceptually or empirically clearly motivating
from other to others or group should also be reflected in
the form of the diagrams (making the group’s circle
larger for exemple). The choice of wording (group,
others. other) is also not innocent and needs to be
motivated and reasoned. Importantly, my intuition is
that if I was a subject in this experiment, the size of
the group (cf 3 above) would affect my way of responding
to this task (identification with a small group is not
the qualitatively the same as the identification with a
larger group).
It may well be the case that the IOS was developed to
index dyadic relationships. However, there is no
principled reason why it cannot be used (with appropriate
rewording) to index group/community membership or,
indeed, affiliation to any other entity. Indeed, in many
ways, its structure (the way the index is phrased, namely
as circles) is much better (and more naturally and
intuitively) adapted to indexing group membership than
dyadic relationships. We and others have so used it in
many published studies (including several published in
Royal Society journals).
We appreciate that many psychological instruments are
complex and require careful validation (and probably with
good reason, given the opaqueness of some of the
questions used). But this is surely mainly because they
ask a large number of verbal questions thought to be
vaguely related to the concept under consideration in
something of a scatter-gun approach. The IOS measure is
about as simple as you can get and is very intuitive, and
we have used it because it correlates extremely well with
other indices of relationship quality and group bonding.
The fact that it is so simple to administer is a
considerable advantage.
We see no real justification for arguing that the circles
need to be of different size: if anything, that seems
like a distraction and likely to be counter-productive.
We have added a paragraph to the Methods to address these
issues.
5) Lack of any 1st person feedback regarding the
experiment: This is a great regret given the design (and
the obtained results). It would have been very rich to
have some form of feedback/report from the subjects
concerning their experience during the viewing of the
film(s). As the authors discuss in the discussion
section, subjective experiences vary considerably and
situation if we would have liked to understand what makes
certain people exhibit affect, social bonding or pain
threshold differences after viewing and others not. I
encourage the authors to include such a component(s) in
future experiments/replcations
In fact, participants did complete a number of other
standard instruments relating to their engagement in and
enjoyment of the films. We feel that adding such data
would not add significantly to the very simple point that
this paper is trying to make, while adding very
substantially to the length of the paper. These data,
which are more suited to social psychology or
communication studies journals, will be published
elsewhere.
B) the obtained results
6) I am missing some graphes such as the relationship
between individual change in IOS and pain threshold and
affect changes (we only get one of the three comparisons
in figure 4).
Affect is not central to the point of this paper but is
included simply because past experience tells us that, if
it isn't included AND shown not to drive the results,
referees will always argue that it might be affect, and
not endorphins, that is driving our results.
It is, of course, always possible to add more graphs (we
are happy to take the editor’s advice on this), but we
took the view that 6 sets of graphs (most of which are
multi-panel) is as much as one should reasonably include,
and that statistical results given in the text are
sufficient for results that are concerned with confounds
rather than the central hypothesis.
7) looking at figure 4, visually it seems that the
difference between the left and the right side of the
plot is driven by 5 individuals that seem to exhibit an
exceptionally high IOS effect. Is this the case? or would
the results remain the same if we take these 5
individuals out?
The result is significant even with these points
excluded. A note to this effect has been added to the
text.
8) It will be useful to plot the same results (4a,b,c)
for the control condition and to test for effect of PANAS
changes and pain threshold differences on IOS in the
control condition too.
same analysis for the control condition, and show that in
the control condition only positive affect influences
IOS. This allows us to be more confident that the pain
threshold (endorphin) effect is quite separate and
requires explicit activation through an external
stimulus. While we hesitate to add yet more graphs to the
paper, we do feel that this is an important result and so
have added a paragraph to the Results as well as adding
the central finding to Fig. 6. We think this greatly
strengthens the paper, and thank the reviewer for
suggesting it.
9) The authors assume or at least strongly suggest a
causal relationship, with pain threshold changes causing
changes in IOS. I am not sure how they arrive at this
directionality. If this is motivated by the statistical
tests I would appreciate if this will be clarified.
This is mainly because the causal relationship is
specified by theory, not the data. We have rethought the
Discussion to avoid any suggestion that this might be
post hoc speculation.
C) Interpretation of the results
10) If causality in (9) is not motivated then pain
threshold differences could be due to changes in social
perception. If this directionality is an optional
interpretation then unfortunately the point in (2)
becomes a source of a serious confound. It is possible to
imagine that change in one’s perception of group-
relatedness will change one’s motivation to stick longer
to the task given the presence of other group members in
the same room. Is there anything I am missing that would
eliminate this interpretation? This interpretation makes
the supposed ‘pain threshold’ effect just another
consequence of changes in group dynamics and not a
measure of hormonal changes.
The study is motivated by a very specific hypothesis –
that endorphins are core to social bonding (at both
dyadic and community levels) in primates, an hypothesis
that derives from a long series of previous experimental
studies (dating back to the 1980s) of both humans and
monkeys – combined with a previously stated suggestion
(also supported indirectly by experimental evidence) that
storytelling may be one of the ways humans have found to
trigger the endorphin system in many individuals
simultaneously. The bottom line is that it is hardly a
post hoc suggestion.
If this is not the case, then we wonder what the point of
the increase in pain threshold as a consequence of
enhanced group bonding actually is – why should the
change in pain threshold be relevant to anything?
Evolution is rarely so profligate as to produce random
effects of no relevance, especially when they are costly
to produce. We know of no principled reason why this
suggestion should be so, and it runs against a consensus
that, in general, physiology drives behaviour and not the
other way around (citations already given in text).
Nonetheless, in acknowledgment of the comment, we have
added a paragraph that addresses this; we have also
reworded the original sentence in the Discussion to leave
open the possibility of alternative explanations that
could be investigated in further studies.
11) Regarding the PANAS results, the study found a
difference between the two conditions only for changes in
negative affect, however, the negative affect was not
explanatory of the changes in IOS (or pain threshold I
assume). Given the narrative of the paper, that it is the
emotional reaction to the film that is the source of the
hormonal and social bonding changes this is at least
surprising but the authors do not properly address this
issue and highlight the relationship between changes in
positive PANAS and IOS. However changes in positive PANAS
were not statistically different across conditions so it
is very hard to follow the logic on the relationship
between film type, PANAS and IOS.
PANAS was included simply to confirm that the pain
results are NOT driven by affect (a suggestion repeatedly
raised by referees of previous publications testing other
mechanisms). If the whole effect was driven by affect
(positive OR negative), it wouldn’t be especially
interesting. We simply want to show that whatever effect
affect has on IOS or pain threshold, it is independent of
any direct relationship between these two indices.
For example, does positive PANAS changes predict
individual IOS differences in the control condition?
Given that both films produced changes in positive PANAS
we would expect IOS to be affected in both conditions. If
it is not, then it is not positive PANAS that is driving
changes in IOS but another factor that remains unknown..
See our answer to [8] above.
In sum, the authors conclude that ‘something’ about the
affect changes) caused changes in endorphine level but
they /we have no idea what this something is. There is a
host of differences between the movies in the two
conditions and a host of possible differences in ‘ways of
engaging with such films. We have no way to tell, given
the used protocol, what is the relevant factor.
We disagree that “we have no idea what this something
is”: “this something” is emotional arousal triggering the
pain mechanism in the brain. We made that quite explicit
in the original Introduction. We do not test that
directly, because we could only assay for endorphins by
PET imaging, and that, as the referee will doubtless be
willing to grant, simply cannot be done with a live
audience -- and simply putting individuals one by one in
a scanner will bypass the whole point of the experiment,
namely that there is a social consequence. We know from
previous studies that the effect of group bonding is
specific to the group subjects do an activity with, and
not to people in general. We have reworded relevant parts
of the Discussion to make this clear.
The films were chosen precisely because they differ in
the extent to which they arouse strong sympathetic
emotions in viewers. We agree that it would be desirable
to test more films to be sure that the key difference is
the one we think is the active ingredient. But one also
needs to be realistic (running experiments on this scale
is extremely challenging compared to sitting a single
subject down in front of a PC). Our point is simply to
establish that there is a phenomenon to explore, and we
are content to leave more detailed unpacking to future
studies.
Very clearly here, other, more subtle, measures of
subjective experience would have come in very handy.
As we noted above, we have these, and they will be
published in more appropriate venues. Our concern here is
to establish one simple point, a point of more explicit
reference to a biological audience.
In any case, given the issues of the directionality
effects (10) and the lack of clarity regarding the PANAS
results and the lack of a measure mediating film
observation and presumed changes in endorphine levels I
cannot follow the authors conclusions from the study.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
I only regret the absence of dialogue with the fields of
aesthetics and phenomenology. (see files attached)
We appreciate referee 3’s thoughtful comments.
<U+F0B7> We are interested in these issues. However, it is
not our intention here to undertake a full study of
all aspects of aesthetic appeal or the appreciation
of drama, but simply to test one specific
hypothesis: our paper is about the possible role of
drama/storytelling in community bonding, not a study
of the many factors that influence aesthetics or the
appreciation of literature. Like all psychology
experiments, we treat the latter as error variance
and ask: is the single effect we are interested in
so strong that its signature can still be detected
despite the smoothing effects all these other
effects.
<U+F0B7> We appreciate that simply comparing two films is
limiting, but whenever one runs experiments one has
to sacrifice something in the interest of
tractability. Our concern is not with the particular
nature of the test film, Stuart, but with whether
ANY film that arouses the audience sufficiently will
kick in the neurobiological mechanism that underpins
all primate (and human) social bonding. It is
challenging enough to engineer an experiment that
compares just two films, never mind all possible
combinations. More importantly perhaps, to test this
hypothesis, we need not films in general but a film
that has some chance of actually doing what we think
is being done. If such a film does NOT have this
effect, then at least we can be sure that the
hypothesis must be wrong. If we can detect what we
think is a signal, then we have a prima facie case
for deeper investigation. Science is incremental and
this study is simply the first small (but we hope
significant) step on a novel trajectory – one which
no one has ever thought of looking at before.
<U+F0B7> There are many psychological and sociological
instruments (questionnaires) that could be used, and
every researcher will have different preferences. We
use the ones we do because they have been widely
used by other researchers and because we too have
used them in many previous studies. They also have
the merit of being conceptually very simple, in
contrast to most social psychology scales which are
often so complex it is far from clear what is
actually being measured.
questionnaire data, but if we included this here it
would take us into realms and lengths of paper
beyond what is reasonable for (a) this journal and
(b) a paper whose sole aim is to establish one
simple point. Subsequent papers will deal with these
data.
<U+F0B7> IOS: see response to ref 2.
<U+F0B7> We have reworded the Discussion to address the
referee’s point (3).
<U+F0B7> We have corrected the typo.
Thanks for the opportunity to undertake further revisions, which we have done to improve the
value and transparency of the paper. We have added a sentence to the Methods to address
the referee’s first point and a paragraph to the Discussion to address the second point. We
have nothing to add concerning the other two points.

Comments to the Author(s)
I find the additions and changes made in the paper very welcome and useful for the clairty of
the inentions behind, results, and interpretation of the study.
Here are some remaining issues I would think should be addressed for the paper to be ready
for publication:
1) affect vs. emotional response: Thanks to the author’s response to 6 I thought I understood
that they distinguish between an emotional response to the film (that is hypothesized to lead
to changes in pain threshold) and changes in emotional affect after the film that they want to
make sure is not the cause of the changes in pain threshold. This distinction is quite subtle
and not well explained in the introduction. It will be worthwhile to be more explicit about it
for readers like myself for which it is not a-priori evident (as it is, seemingly, to the authors).
I think the discussion is clearer now in this respect but the following sentence brings back the
confusion:
"This may reflect the fact that, like most psychological scales, PANAS is a verbal task and so
probably taps into high-order cognitive reflection that may be unrelated to the more visceral
sub-cortical emotion responses that directly trigger an endorphin response.”
So are affect post-film and emotional response during the film dissociable (as it seems now
from the first part of the discussion) or is it that the PANAS is simply too high level to evaluate
the relevant post film affective changes?
Maybe once again this confusion is due to my naivety concerning the issue of affect vs. "more
visceral sub-cortical emotion" but this could be the case of many of the potential readers so
clarification would be appreciated.
2) I am afraid that my point in (10) was not made clear enough. I will try to be more explicit.
Here is how I understand the logic of the author’s argument:
(a) The target film produces an emotional response not present in the control film,
(b) that emotional response produces via endorphine release
(c) (1) pain threshold changes and
(d) (2) increase in group identification.
Here is an alternative scenario:
(a) the target film, due maybe to its empathic effect (real life story presented in a pseudo-
documentary style) or possibly any other different between it and the control film, produces
(b) a stronger group identification that in turn makes people try to resist longer to the pain
during the threshold experiment (auxiliary hypothesis that sounds reasonable: competition in
this kind of tasks increases with group bonding.)
which brings about
(c) seemingly higher pain threshold results
In other words, it is proposed the change observed in the task is not a change in pain
threshold ‘per-se’ but an affect on the decision process to stop holding the position due to
perceived peer pressure.
I can easily recall situations in which I persisted in a painful state that I would have otherwise
not prolonged because of the presence of a specific person next to me. This is very
different (in my subjective experience) from other cases where increase in some form of
arousal made me less sensible to pain, for exemple when I dance and ‘forget’ an otherwise
painful injury.
And so as a response to the authors question:"then we wonder what the point of the increase
in pain threshold as a consequence of enhanced group bonding actually is – why should the
change in pain threshold be relevant to anything?”
is that they should make an effort to look at the inverse logic to the one they proposed. I
understand that this is not what the authors wanted to study but I am still at odds wrt to their
very strong opinion that their scenario should be more or less self evident and that such an
alternative hypothesis is somehow far fetched or impossible to imagine…
It seems that the authors make too many short cuts which they motivate by primate and
other literature but that remain problematic given the specific film and specific task that were
used in their protocol and that leave too many degrees of liberty in the interpretation.
I consider that the caveat in the discussion regarding their interpretation of the results needs
to be made stronger (their story should be further qualified as only one possible explanation).
We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful comments on this point, and we agree. We have
therefore added a paragraph to the Discussion to make this point, and to suggest possible
ways to test between these alternatives. At the same time, we have added a mediation
analysis which, while not methodologically ideal, nonetheless does favour our interpretation.
3) with respect to the IOS study, I appreciate the clarifications in the text but again I find the
response of the authors to the comments made naive while tending towards dismissive.
Let us start with the difference between group, other and others.
Linguistically group is a collective noun. If I am asked to asses my belonging to the group I
will take the collective as the entity of reference.
My intuition (shared by a number of persons I have asked) is that when I am asked to use two
circles to represent my relationship to a group it would be an inclusion relation (where a
spatial analogy would be ‘the chair is inside the house but the car is not inside the house).
However, when I am asked (as in the original and standardized version of the IOS) to use two
circles to represent me and another person I interpret the question as a question of (self)
identification. I don’t see how these two are the same in anyway.
I am happy for the authors to use a diagram as a test for group inclusion but I find it
problematic to present it as a natural extension of a personal identification test.
If, as they make clear, they don’t think that such a scale , being so intuitive and simple,
requires any form of validation then why cite a validation study for (what I consider to be,
and with no evidence to the contrary will remain convinced to be) a different measure as a
reference?
N.B. Other studies used ‘others’ which is ambiguous as plurals often are, between a collective
and distributive reading and so could elicit one of the two reasonings above or a mixe of
both.
Also, can the authors be more specific as to the exact instruction given to the participants ?
I wonder if the authors took the time to ask (at least few) subjects what they meant by their
drawings (some explicitaiton is always a good start to understand underlying mechanisms)
We have never had anyone, either as a referee (including on other Royal Society as well as
mainline psychology journals) or as a reader or as a study participant, ever question the
interpretation of this scale when used in this context, and we find it genuinely puzzling that
the reviewer seems to be making such heavy weather of the issue. The interpretation has
always seemed perfectly obvious and intuitive to everyone. Incidentally, we do not cite a
validation study as a justification for our use of this scale, but simply as the source for the
scale.
4) Reflecting on the authors response to my last point and to review 3: I am a trained linguist
and nearo-linguist and I find it highly problematic when non-linguist researchers make
gross oversimplifications in psycho or neurolinguisitic studies (for exemple comparing verbs
to nouns) in the name of intuition, ignoring the highly complex differences (well documented
in the expert literature) across and within the classes they chose to study . The situation here
is analogous. The authors, which are not (I believe) specialists in aesthetics (and in particular
the sub field of durational art) seem very comfortable to use two films that differ on many
(well studied by the relevant discipline) aspects and to claim that the relevant difference is the
one they decide on, using their naive (non-expert) intuition.
Apart from being disrespectful to an existing field of knowledge and expertises, this is
particularly problematic here as I have briefly proposed above that other features of the target
film could have provided another explanation to the observed effect not passing through the
critical-to-the-authors endorphin releasing step. The last paragraph written in response to
reviewer 1 and 3’s points should, to my mind, be clearer on this point.
We don't doubt the complexity of art, and our response to referee #3 was not to dismiss
these considerations, but simply to point out that the very process of experimentation
necessitates some simplifying assumptions and inevitable corner-cutting. One cannot possibly
test all possible combinations of what might be involved. Not only would one never finish, but
any resulting paper would be unmanageably large and indigestible. We should note that the
majority (5 out of 7) of the authors on this paper are specialists in literature and drama, and
can be credited with some familiarity with the issues raised by the reviewer.
