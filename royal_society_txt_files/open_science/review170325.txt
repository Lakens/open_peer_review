Comments to the Author(s)

This manuscript is interesting and well-written and describes a major issue in the field of amyloid
beta research: namely that of inconsistent results derived upon aggregation of the peptide. The
fluorescamine assay described could well target this problem in a laboratory-to-laboratory
independent manner although the manuscript does not demonstrate clear experiment-based
evidence for a benefit of using the proposed fluorescamine assay over absorbance at 280 nm.
Below suggestions may aid demonstrating these benefits.
Line 35 on page 4 states that "The lowest amine concentration in standard curve
determination corresponds to an Aß concentration of 0.23 µM, suggesting that the
fluorescamine method has sub-micromolar sensitivity for Aß quantification." It would help the
readers if the authors state 1. how this number of 0.23 uM was derived, 2. which standard curve
of the ones shown in figure 1 is referred to, if any specifically, 3. to experimentally demonstrate
this statement by including a fluorescamine assay at this Abeta concentration.
Figure 2 is not straightforward to understand. I suggest that the authors plot the real
concentration data instead of a % concentration difference in this plot. Even though the difference
is always less than 10 % perhaps the authors could say something more in their discussion about
the observed difference between high (>250 uM fluorescamine) and low fluorescamine
concentrations.
The authors conclude that "... the background signal is higher and the slope is lower with 70%
DMSO than those of standard curves without DMSO, indicating that sensitivity may be lower in
the presence of DMSO." Even though the linear relationships remain, the slope of the curves in
the presence or absence of DMSO is very different. This means that the experimentalist would
have to derive a new calibration curve with different DMSO concentration. This should be
mentioned in the discussion section and a dose-dependence of DMSO concentrations should be
derived. A similar assay should be performed in the presence of other solvents commonly used to
dissolve Abeta, e.g. TFA or HFIP.
It is unclear to me which question the authors would like to address in Figure 5. To me, it seems
that these data demonstrate that different solubilization procedures result in different
aggregation kinetics, which has been demonstrated before and does not add to the message of the
manuscript. Further the authors state in their figure legend that "... the thioflavin T fluorescence
reaches similar intensity at aggregation plateau despite having very different lag times." I tend to
disagree with this statement, as, particularly for the NaOH protocol, it seems as if plateau values
4
show more than 20% variation. In my opinion this figure could be removed while extending
figure 6 as outlined in my suggestion below.
To really demonstrate the power of the fluorescamine assay it would be required to compare
aggregation kinetics, as demonstrated in figure 6, with aggregation kinetics of three
independently prepared samples but with concentrations normalized using absorbance at 280
nm.
A major issue when studying abeta, and specifically abeta42, is the fact that it rapidly aggregates
within a time frame of minutes of preparation. As plenty of authors have already demonstrated
that obtaining a true monomeric solution of this peptide is close to impossible it would be very
valuable if the authors could show the power of the fluorescamine assay in aggregated abeta42
solutions. This could be done by monitoring fluorescamine-based concentration upon incubating
abeta42 over a period of time (e.g. 24 hours after which abeta42 is mostly aggregated). As the
authors suggest that fluorescamine is primarily recognizing lysine residues, aggregation may
impact on the reliable detection of abeta42 concentration upon aggregation. These data should
then be compared in a similar fashion using absorbance at 280 nm.
I have a general concern about the statistical analysis used in the manuscript. For example, figure
1 is based on two independent measurements and a standard deviation is calculated. This only
provides you with one degree of freedom which is very limited. My suggestion would be either
to increase the number of samples to calculate a more reliable standard deviation or to provide
information on the range of data that were provided.

Overall, the authors adequately addressed all suggestions and comments raised by both
reviewers, often by expanding the amount of discussion or by performing appropriate additional
and clarifying experiments.
A few minor suggestions remain, based on the resubmitted manuscript:
1. At concentrations [of] 0.1 uM or lower, the signal is not significantly larger than background --
> Add 'of' between 'concentrations' and '0.1 uM'.
2. Figure 6: the authors claim that the curves are clustered more tightly together when
investigating aggregation kinetics of samples which have been concentration-corrected using
fluorescamine as opposed to UV absorbance. Even though this seems reasonably obvious from
the figure, it would be perhaps more substantial if the authors could quantify this by e.g. showing
bar graphs, based on the results in figure 6, of spread of e.g. final fluorescence intensities, lag
phase and polymerization rates as a function of concentration determination method as an insert
into this figure.

We thank the reviewers for their review and comments. We have revised our manuscript
rdingly. Major changes are underlined in the main text. Detailed below are our point-by-point
nses.
ewer: 1
ments to the Author(s)
is manuscript the authors report the finding that fluorescamine as a probe to measure the
oid beta (Aß) peptide concentration with sub-micromolar sensitivity. After using various
entrations of fluorescamine they were able to find an optimal concentration of the probe, which
d be used to determine the concentration of the A? using fluorescence. It is also true that most
e Aß components have a fast aggregation tendency and their working solution must need to
low concentration and have to prepare fast to avoid aggregation. The argument about the
nce of other solvents like DMSO for special purposes like synthesis of Aß oligomers is very
acceptable as it might interfere with the tyrosine absorbance due to its high background
l in that region. The manuscript findings are interesting, but there are some unaddressed
s which need to be clarified such as:
is true that there are some limitations using tyrosine absorbance at 280 nm due to its low
tivity and numbers in the Aß to determine the concentration, but it is also a fast and reliable
od to do the same for other proteins including Aß without using any external probe. The
ion of Aß could be prepared at the lowest possible concentrations to minimize their
egation in order to use the 280 nm absorbance.
Response: We agree with the reviewer’s point. What we are trying to show in the
script is that the fluorescamine method is just as convenient as the UV absorbance, and with
er sensitivity. Even though the fluorescamine method requires a standard curve, the standard
e can be prepared in advance and does not need to be run with every concentration
urement. The standard curve is also extremely stable with the same batch of fluorescamine
different curves from different days are compared. We have also discussed cases where
rbance can’t be used. One such example is Aß42 oligomer preparation, which often requires
O. We have also seen, in many cases, that only nominal concentrations are reported without
lly measuring them. We hope that with the re-introduction of the fluorescamine method, we
elp to eliminate those uncertainties in Aß research and make the experiments more
ducible.
thors may describe or compare the advantages or disadvantages of their method with other
ing popular methods like Bradford, Lowry.
Response: We have included a description of the advantages and limitations of the
escamine method in the revised manuscript (page 3, last paragraph, underlined). Because this
script only describes the use of fluorescamine in a specific case of Aß research, we tried to
our discussion brief. The added sentences are copied below for the reviewer’s convenience.
“Compared with other commonly used protein quantification methods such as Lowry [21],
Bradford [22], and BCA [23], the major advantage of the fluorescamine method is that it
does not require incubation and thus is truly a mix-and-click method. The only limitations of
the fluorescamine method are that it relies on the knowledge of the number of accessible
lysines in the protein and that the buffer cannot contain any primary amines (ruling out the
use of glycine or Tris). In the particular case of Aß, these conditions are usually satisfied as
Aß experiments are generally performed with purified Aß in PBS buffer.”
the results and discussion section (page 4, line 18-24), the authors have mentioned that bovine
m albumin (BSA) has been used as a standard for fluorescamine assays in the literature [26],
they considered it not an ideal standard for this particular application citing the accessibility
ly 30% amine in BSA compared to 100% in lysozyme. As they have also mentioned that BSA is
ostly used standard protein, so did they perform any assay with fluorescamine and compare
that of standard lysozyme before deeming it unfit for this assay?
Response: Yes, we have used BSA standards for fluorescamine assay and we couldn’t get
agreement with absorbance. That is why we turned to lysozyme. We have now included one
f data on BSA to show that BSA gave a dramatically different slope from the lysozyme. The
data is plotted in Figure 1D (copied below for the reviewer’s convenience).
e authors aim to find a suitable technique to measure the concentration of Aß with more
ession than the existing methods. The significance of studying the aggregation kinetics may be
er explained.
Response: Review 2 also raised similar concerns and gave specific suggestions. We have
letely re-written this part of the text. The Figures 5 and 6 from the original manuscript were
ved and replaced with new Figures 6 and 7 in the revised manuscript.
r Minor Comments:
thors used the short abbreviation “Aß” for “amyloid beta” without mentioning what it stands
Response: We have now defined the abbreviation “Aß”, and used full name “amyloid-ß” in
tle.
e authors have mentioned the molar extinction coefficient in mM-1cm-1 instead of M-1cm-1.
Response: We have changed the units of molar extinction coefficient to M-1 cm-1.
e description of the figures was not very clear. It’s sort of hard to understand the figures from
gure description alone.
Response: We have now revised our figure descriptions so that they do a better job at
ing on their own.

manuscript is interesting and well-written and describes a major issue in the field of amyloid
research: namely that of inconsistent results derived upon aggregation of the peptide. The
escamine assay described could well target this problem in a laboratory-to-laboratory
pendent manner although the manuscript does not demonstrate clear experiment-based
nce for a benefit of using the proposed fluorescamine assay over absorbance at 280 nm. Below
estions may aid demonstrating these benefits.
35 on page 4 states that "The lowest amine concentration in standard curve
mination corresponds to an Aß concentration of 0.23 µM, suggesting that the fluorescamine
od has sub-micromolar sensitivity for Aß quantification." It would help the readers if the
ors state 1. how this number of 0.23 uM was derived, 2. which standard curve of the ones
n in figure 1 is referred to, if any specifically, 3. to experimentally demonstrate this statement
cluding a fluorescamine assay at this Abeta concentration.
Response: We have clarified this statement as suggested. The revised text is underlined on
4, last paragraph. We have also included it below for the reviewer’s convenience.
“In all the standard curves with lysozyme, the lowest lysozyme concentration was 0.1 µM,
and this corresponds to an amine concentration of 0.7 µM. Because Aß consists of 3 primary
amines, the 0.7 µM amine concentration can be translated into 0.23 µM Aß concentration.
Therefore, these standard curves suggest that the fluorescamine method may be able to
detect Aß at as low as 0.23 µM. The detection sensitivity of the fluorescamine method is
further investigated below.”
As suggested by the reviewer, we performed additional experiments to investigate the
tivity of the fluorescamine method and compare it with the sensitivity of UV absorbance.
e data are reported in Figure 5. This part of text is located on page 6, middle of the page,
rlined, and also copied below for the reviewer’s convenience.
Figure 5. Comparison of detection sensitivity for the fluorescamine and absorbance methods. (A)
Measured Aß42 concentrations using 500 µM fluorescamine are plotted as a function of calculated
concentrations based on dilution. A data point on the diagonal line means perfect agreement between
measured and calculated concentrations. Deviation from the diagonal line suggests that the measurements
are losing accuracy. The measured concentrations for 0.5 µM or higher agree perfectly with calculated
concentrations. The measurements for the 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 µM are 7, 19, and 32% off from the calculated
concentrations, respectively. Concentrations at 0.1 µM or lower gave fluorescence signal similar to
background. (B) Measured Aß42 concentrations using absorbance at 280 nm are plotted as a function of
calculated concentrations based on dilution. Perfect agreements are shown at Aß concentrations of 50 µM
or higher. Deviations of 44% and 140% from calculated values are found for 20 and 10 µM Aß. With
perfect agreements at 0.5 µM Aß for the fluorescamine method and at 50 µM Aß for the absorbance
method, the fluorescamine method is 100 times more sensitive than the absorbance method.
“We also compared the Aß detection sensitivity of the fluorescamine method and
absorbance method (Figure 5). For the fluorescamine method, we started from an Aß42
sample in PBS at 1 µM concentration, which was determined using fluorescamine. Then this
Aß42 sample was diluted to 0.8, 0.6, 0.5 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 µM, and the
concentration was determined using fluorescamine. As shown in Figure 5A, we found
perfect agreement between measured concentrations and calculated concentrations when Aß
concentration is 0.5 µM or higher. Aß concentrations at 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 µM showed a
difference of 7, 19, and 32% between measured and calculated values. At concentrations 0.1
µM or lower, the signal is not significantly larger than background.
For the absorbance method, we started from an Aß42 sample dissolved in a high pH
denaturing buffer containing 20 mM CAPS (pH 11) and 7 M GdnHCl at a concentration of
350 µM, which was determined using absorbance at 280 nm. We then diluted this Aß
sample to 200, 100, 50, 20, and 10 µM, and the concentration was determined again using
absorbance. As shown in Figure 5B, we found perfect agreement when Aß concentration is
50 µM or higher. However, a deviation of 44% from the calculated value was found for the
20 µM Aß42 sample, and a deviation of >100% from the calculated value was found for the
10 µM Aß42 sample, suggesting that absorbance at 280 nm is not suitable for Aß
concentrations at 20 µM or lower. At 20 µM, the theoretical absorbance value of Aß is
approximately 0.023, a value that is generally considered too low for accurate measurement
of absorbance.”
re 2 is not straightforward to understand. I suggest that the authors plot the real concentration
instead of a % concentration difference in this plot. Even though the difference is always less
10 % perhaps the authors could say something more in their discussion about the observed
rence between high (>250 uM fluorescamine) and low fluorescamine concentrations.
Response: We have taken the reviewer’s suggestion and plotted the real concentration data
gure 2. We have also added more discussion about the observed difference between high and
luorescamine concentrations (page 5, first paragraph, underlined). This part of the text and new
re 2 are copied below.
“For reasons we do not fully understand, the measured Aß concentrations obtained using the
low fluorescamine concentrations (62.5 and 125 µM) are higher than that obtained using
absorbance, while the high fluorescamine concentrations (250, 500, and 1000 µM) yielded
lower concentrations than the absorbance method (Figure 2). It is also worth pointing out
that the measured Aß concentrations using high fluorescamine concentrations (>250 µM)
have better agreement with the absorbance method.”
authors conclude that "... the background signal is higher and the slope is lower with 70%
O than those of standard curves without DMSO, indicating that sensitivity may be lower in the
nce of DMSO." Even though the linear relationships remain, the slope of the curves in the
nce or absence of DMSO is very different. This means that the experimentalist would have to
e a new calibration curve with different DMSO concentration. This should be mentioned in the
ssion section and a dose-dependence of DMSO concentrations should be derived. A similar
y should be performed in the presence of other solvents commonly used to dissolve Abeta, e.g.
or HFIP.
Response: We have revised our discussion to mention the necessity of deriving a new
ard curve for each DMSO concentration. We have also performed additional experiments in
resence of HFIP and TFA. The presence of HFIP has similar effects as DMSO, while the
nce of TFA completely inhibits the fluorescamine reaction. We also compared concentration
urements of Aß42 in the absence of DMSO/HFIP, and in the presence of 70% DMSO or 70%
. This part of data is reported in Figure 3, and described on page 5, last three paragraphs (new
underlined and copied below).
Figure 3. Fluorescamine method is compatible with DMSO and HFIP. (A) Standard curve using hen
egg white lysozyme in the presence of 70% DMSO (open and closed circles) and 70% HFIP (open and
closed triangles). The presence of 70% TFA completely abolished fluorescamine reaction (opan and
closed squares). Lines are linear fits to the data. A.U., arbitrary unit. (B) Concentration of Aß42
determined using the fluorescamine method in the absence and presence of 70% DMSO or 70% HFIP.
Error bars are the standard deviations of three independent measurements.
“The linear relationship remains, with an r2 value at >0.99, but the slope with 70% DMSO is
dramatically lower than the slope without DMSO. Additional fluorescamine measurements
with lower concentrations of DMSO show that the slope of the standard curve increases with
decreasing concentrations of DMSO, approaching the slope without DMSO (data not
shown). Therefore, it is important that, for accurate concentration measurements, the
standard curves should be obtained according to the buffer compositions of the specific
experiments.
Similar to DMSO, hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) are two
organic solvents that are commonly used to solubilize and disaggregate Aß. Here we also
examined if the fluorescamine method is compatible with HFIP and TFA. We found that a
linear relationship exists between fluorescamine fluorescence and lysozyme concentration in
the presence of 70% HFIP (Figure 3A). However, the presence of 70% TFA completely
abolished the fluorescamine reaction (Figure 3A).
Consequent concentration determination of the Aß42 sample demonstrates good agreement
between the measurements in the absence of any organic solvents and in the presence of
70% DMSO or 70% HFIP (Figure 3B). However, the slope of the standard curve is lower
with 70% DMSO or 70% HFIP, indicating that sensitivity may be lower. DMSO also gives a
higher background signal in the absence of proteins. Because HFIP is a volatile solvent,
extra care must be taken when performing assays with HFIP, which evaporates quickly and
may contribute to larger errors in concentration measurements (Figure 3B).”
unclear to me which question the authors would like to address in Figure 5. To me, it seems
hese data demonstrate that different solubilization procedures result in different aggregation
ics, which has been demonstrated before and does not add to the message of the manuscript.
her the authors state in their figure legend that "... the thioflavin T fluorescence reaches similar
sity at aggregation plateau despite having very different lag times." I tend to disagree with this
ment, as, particularly for the NaOH protocol, it seems as if plateau values show more than
variation. In my opinion this figure could be removed while extending figure 6 as outlined in
uggestion below.
Response: We agree with the reviewer and have removed the old Figure 5.
ally demonstrate the power of the fluorescamine assay it would be required to compare
egation kinetics, as demonstrated in figure 6, with aggregation kinetics of three independently
ared samples but with concentrations normalized using absorbance at 280 nm.
Response: We have taken the reviewer’s advice and performed new experiments of three
pendently prepared samples with concentrations determined with fluorescamine and absorbance.
we set up aggregation kinetics based on concentrations using fluorescamine and absorbance.
e results are shown in Figure 6 and are described on page 7, first paragraph (underlined).
re 6 and relevant description are copied below.
Figure 6. Comparison of Aß42 aggregation kinetics with concentrations determined using
fluorescamine (A) or absorbance (B). Three Aß42 samples were prepared separately at approximately
30-40 µM. For each sample, the concentration was determined using both fluorescamine and absorbance.
Then four repeats of aggregation experiments were set up for each sample. The overall fluorescence
intensity reaches similar values at aggregation plateau when concentrations are determined using
fluorescamine (A) and absorbance (B), suggesting a general agreement of the two methods. However,
aggregation curves for samples using the fluorescamine method are more tightly clustered together,
suggesting better consistency with the fluorescamine method.
“We prepared three independent Aß42 samples in PBS buffer at concentrations of 30-40 µM
concentration, as determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Aß42 concentrations at this range
ensure relatively accurate concentration measurements using absorbance. The concentration
of each sample was also determined using fluorescamine. Then we set up aggregation
kinetics experiments at 5 µM concentration, with 4 repeats for each sample. The results, as
shown in Figure 6, show that similar aggregation kinetics curves were obtained with
concentrations determined with fluorescamine (Figure 6A) and absorbance (Figure 6B). The
two sets of experiments have similar lag time and similar fluorescence intensity at
aggregation plateau, which is a quantitative measure of the amount of amyloid fibrils [3].
Therefore, these results show a general agreement between the fluorescamine and
absorbance methods. However, the kinetics curves with the fluorescamine method are more
tightly clustered together than those with the absorbance method, suggesting that the
fluorescamine method has better consistency for low Aß concentrations.”
jor issue when studying abeta, and specifically abeta42, is the fact that it rapidly aggregates
n a time frame of minutes of preparation. As plenty of authors have already demonstrated that
ning a true monomeric solution of this peptide is close to impossible it would be very valuable
authors could show the power of the fluorescamine assay in aggregated abeta42 solutions.
could be done by monitoring fluorescamine-based concentration upon incubating abeta42 over
iod of time (e.g. 24 hours after which abeta42 is mostly aggregated). As the authors suggest
luorescamine is primarily recognizing lysine residues, aggregation may impact on the reliable
tion of abeta42 concentration upon aggregation. These data should then be compared in a
ar fashion using absorbance at 280 nm.
Response: We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and performed concentration
urements for two Aß42 samples with incubation at either 37°C or 4°C. Upon incubation at 24
37°C, we saw approximately 70% reduction in apparent Aß42 concentration as determined by
escamine. This suggests that the lysine residues in the fibrils become solvent-inaccessible,
enting accurate concentration determination using the fluorescamine method. For Aß42
les incubated at 4°C, however, the apparent concentrations as determined using the
escamine method remain largely unchanged. These results are reported in Figure 7 and
ibed on page 7, second paragraph (underlined).
Figure 7. Concentration measurements with fluorescamine for Aß samples incubated at 37°C (A) and
4°C (B). Incubation at 37°C leads to rapid aggregation of Aß42, and consequent reduction in apparent
concentrations measured using the fluorescamine method (A). This is due to the reduction of the number of
solvent-accessible lysine side chains as a result of protein aggregation. In contrast, only small changes were
observed for Aß42 samples incubated at 4°C at similar concentrations, suggesting that Aß42 remains soluble at
4°C during the incubation period.
“We next investigated whether fluorescamine can be used to monitor the Aß concentration
during the process of aggregation. If lysine residues were exposed in the fibrils, we would be
able to determine Aß concentration for not just soluble Aß, but also aggregated Aß. As
shown in Figure 7A, upon incubation at 37°C for 24 h, the apparent Aß42 concentration as
determined by fluorescamine fluorescence was reduced by approximately 70%, suggesting
that the majority of the lysine residues became buried in the fibrils. In contrast, incubation of
Aß42 samples at 4°C results in only small changes in apparent concentration for at least 48 h,
suggesting that Aß42 samples remain soluble at 4°C during the incubation period.”
e a general concern about the statistical analysis used in the manuscript. For example, figure
ased on two independent measurements and a standard deviation is calculated. This only
ides you with one degree of freedom which is very limited. My suggestion would be either to
ase the number of samples to calculate a more reliable standard deviation or to provide
mation on the range of data that were provided.
Response: We have now plotted individual data points instead of the mean and error bar in
re 1 and Figure 3A. Standard deviations are calculated for data points with three independent
urements in other figures.

ments to the Author(s)
all, the authors adequately addressed all suggestions and comments raised by both reviewers,
by expanding the amount of discussion or by performing appropriate additional and clarifying
riments.
minor suggestions remain, based on the resubmitted manuscript:

of' between 'concentrations' and '0.1 uM'.
Response: This has been corrected as suggested.
gure 6: the authors claim that the curves are clustered more tightly together when investigating
egation kinetics of samples which have been concentration-corrected using fluorescamine as
sed to UV absorbance. Even though this seems reasonably obvious from the figure, it would be
aps more substantial if the authors could quantify this by e.g. showing bar graphs, based on the
ts in figure 6, of spread of e.g. final fluorescence intensities, lag phase and polymerization
as a function of concentration determination method as an insert into this figure.
Response: We have now added a new panel C to figure 6, in which we show the spread of
thioflavin T fluorescence intensity together with a box plot. The new figure 6 is copied below.
