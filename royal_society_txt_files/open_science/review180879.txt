Review of "From hand to mouth: Greater effort in motor preparation is required for voluntary
control of vocalization than for touching in monkeys "
The authors compared the performance of operant conditioned tasks in Japanese macaques when
the monkeys were required to respond manually or by vocalization. The authors central claims
are: (1) the current work is the first to directly compare manual and vocal operant conditioning
tasks (line 148), (2) the poorer performance of the monkeys in the vocal tasks indicates deficit in
motor preparation and/or inhibitory control of vocalization (lines 161-162), (3) evolutionary, the
relevant step was the greater control due to expansion of the direct cortico-motoneuroanal
connections in laryngeal motor cortex. Overall, I think that primate studies on vocalization need
to be reproduced more times and studied with more care, and this study might fit that category.
Nevertheless, (1) this study is not the first one to make a direct comparison between manual and
vocal operant conditioning tasks, (2) the logic of the study is not well-thought, (3) the manuscript
is missing several key articles, and (4) the conclusions are largely exaggerated. I will detail my
concerns below.
1) The current work is not the first one to directly compare the manual and vocal operant
conditioning tasks. For example, Sutton et al. - Vocal and Nonvocal Discriminative Performance
in Monkeys - Brain and Language (1981) trained in a discriminative task the same monkey to
respond using vocalization or manual responses. The authors should cite this article and other
related ones in the manuscript and should drop the claim of primacy should. The authors of this
manuscript will note that Sutton et al. (1981) already showed that the delay for vocal response is
longer compared to manual response. Nevertheless, different from the current manuscript,
Sutton et al. (1981) argue that there is no intrinsic difficulty on monkeys to learn to respond
vocally to operant conditioned tasks.
2) On a similar note, the authors should read and cite Pierce - A Review of Attempts to Condition
Operantly Alloprimate Vocalizations - Primates (1985). Pierce reviewed 12 works in which
macaques are conditioned to vocalize. There is an interesting discussion of why some authors
might have had difficulty in training the monkeys to vocalize conditionally. Pierce (1985)
proposes an "ecologically-appropriate hypothesis" to explain the results of 12 operant
conditioning experiments for vocal production. The following is from the conclusion in Pierce
(1985) "This hypothesis proposes that an understanding of artificial environment behavior is
predicated upon a knowledge of behavior in the natural environment. Experiments incorporating
appropriate contexts and social reinforcers into the artificial experimental situation yielded the
best results."
3) Although there are few claims in the literature that it is more difficult to train a monkey to
produce vocalization in operant conditioned tasks, there are dozens of studies showing successful
training of monkeys to produce vocalization in conditioned tasks, since at least Myers (1965).
Those studies suggest that the difficulty is not necessary in the monkey, but it could be in the
experimenter or experimental setup. It is a possibility that the authors should consider.
3
4) In general, it is difficult to determine the reason why the monkeys took longer to learn the task,
why the response latency was longer, and why the animal performed worse in the probe task
when vocalization was required. Therefore, the authors should consider the other possibilities
that explain the results. It is clear that behavior does not exist in isolation. It also depends on the
context, motivation, and biomechanics. A vocalization is usually produced during social
interaction, which is not necessarily the case for manual responses. Therefore, it is possible that
the operant conditioned setup used by the authors are inadequate to motivate the animal. One
evidence for the inadequacy is that the animals were trained without seeing the experimenter.
Probably the authors' rationale was to avoid experimenter bias, but it is likely that such an
approach made more difficult for the animal to learn the vocal task, but not necessary the manual
task. Sutton et al. (1981) and Pierce (1985) use similar reasoning to explain why some authors
might have difficulty in training the monkeys on conditioned vocal responses.
5) Moreover, the longer delay in responding could be solely related to the biomechanics of vocal
production. To produce a vocalization, the animal has to use the respiratory system, laryngeal
system, tongue, mouth, lips, etc, in coordinated fashion. It is likely that the monkey's reaction
time is longer simply because it takes more time to couple these body parts. The respiratory cycle
for example is an obvious element that constraints the timing of vocalization, because the
monkeys can only produce calls during expiratory cycles. The respiratory constraint would
explain why the monkeys had worse performance in the probe tests when the inter-trial intervals
were shorter. The authors should consider these possibilities.
6) Other factors that are known to reduce vocal production are head or body restraint, different
positioning of the body, water/food restriction. All of the listed factors affect vocal behavior
differently from manual behaviors. Please, take into account these possibilities
7) We also know that the age of the animal has an influence on the rate of conditioned vocal
production, Hage et al. - Developmental changes of cognitive vocal control in monkeys - Journal
of Experimental Biology (2016). If the animals can produce calls in an operant conditioned tasks
when they are juveniles, why they would stop when older? The most parsimonious explanation
is that they can learn, but don't have the motivation or condition to produce, which could be the
case for the animals of this manuscript (although I did not find the ages of the animals).
In any case, it is necessary to be careful on the conclusion that the poorer performance of the
monkeys in the vocal tasks indicates a deficit in motor preparation and/or inhibitory control of
vocalization.
8) Similarly, the authors' conclusion that their results are evidence for the necessity of a direct
cortico-motoneuroanal connections in laryngeal motor cortex does not hold. As mentioned above
the first reason is that it is not clear that the source of the poorer performance of the monkeys on
vocal tasks is due to neural constraints. Second, human speech capacity is definitely not due only
to constraints in laryngeal control. Formants are acoustic features that characterize human speech
and the same formants can be produced with different laryngeal membrane oscillations, i.e.,
different laryngeal muscle tensions. That is because the primary source of formant shapes is the
filtering of the sound by the supralaryngeal vocal tract. Hence, tongues and mouth shapes are as
important as or maybe more important than the fine control of the larynx (small changes in the
frequency are not relevant). A clear example is a whispering sound in which there is a reduced or
no laryngeal membrane oscillation but still allows to establish a conversation. Hence, the
hypothesis that laryngeal muscle control is the necessary evolutionary step is doubtful at best (for
more arguments against the LMC hypothesis see for example Lameira - Neurosci Biobehav Rev
(2017)). Finally, it is highly unlikely that a single reason, e.g., increased connectivity from LMC to
nucleus ambiguus, can explain the evolution of speech, let alone the evolution of language.
4
9) Overall, the manuscript needs a significant rewriting, taking into account the other
explanations for the findings, acknowledging the caveats, and citing the other studies on
conditioned vocalizations (e.g. Sutton et al., 1981; the studies cited in Pierce ,1985).

This is an interesting study in which the investigators compared the capacity of Japanese
macaques to learn a reach-to-touch task vs a vocalisation task. The question of whether or not
macaques can learn to generate a vocalisation in response to a visual stimulus is interesting
because of the major differences in macaque vocal behaviour, compared with humans, and the
differences in motor circuitry that may underpin these variations. The study shows that monkeys
can learn, in a closed sound-proof chamber, to generate vocalisations in response to a change in
screen colour (black to red), and to suppress vocalisations during the inter-trial interval. Training
took much longer than the reach-to-touch movement, investigated in two other monkeys. The
researchers proved the establishment of the stimulus-vocal response by showing a statistically
robust relationship between random variations in the duration of the inter-trial period (black
screen, during which the monkeys had to withhold the response) and the timing of the vocal
response.
General comment
This is a potentially novel set of experimental, behavioural observations. However, the training
methodology and criteria are not well-enough described in the present version to make a
compelling paper. The paper could be considerably strengthened and clarified, by giving more
detail about how the study was carried out, and how the data were analysed. More detail is
needed about the vocalisations generated by the monkeys. The english in the paper is s poor, and
it needs to be edited by a scientist whose mother-tongue is english.

Detailed comments
1. P4 ln 59 Control of the forelimb and hand certainly involves direct projections from motor
cortex to motoneurons, but these do not work in isolation from other pathways (see ref 30
Summary Point #5). This should be clarified.
2. P5. The two parts of the experiment seem a bit unbalanced. The objective of the reach-to-touch
task can be assessed by contact with the touch screen. In the vocalisation task, we are not told
anything about the nature of the vocalisations emitted by the monkeys. Were these short single
cries or maintained?
3. P5. We are not told about what other forms of upper limb movements the monkeys exhibited
during the manual training: for example, what did the monkey do during the (long) periods
when the screen was black? Obviously the monkey could have made all sorts of different
movements, as long as it did not touch the screen. Again, in the vocalisation task, did the
monkeys vocalise at all during the black screen period. If so, did that result in a time-out in the
task sequence?
4. P6 ln106. After completing the vocal/manual training. It is not explained what criterion
/threshold was used to assess whether or not a vocalisation had been made. It is also not
explained when training was considered to be complete. Presumably this was the case when a
monkeys responses occurred after the screen change (as indicated by Fig S3e and f), and with a
relatively stable latency (FigS3a and b)?
5. P6 and Fig S3. I do not understand why the number of sessions for completion of training was
57 and 47 trials in Take and Pike, respectively. Indeed, looking at Fig S3d, it looks as though the
monkey was trained much earlier (around sessions 30-35) but then performance deteriorated?
How is the % correct score for sessions 40-57 in Fig S3h reconcilable with the C/F index shown
for these sessions in Fig S3d? I assume it is due to changes in ISI, indicated in FigS1 (Take
data)but these changes need to be indicated in Fig S3.
6. P7 ln 126 reached the criteria: but these criteria are not defined.
7. P7 ln 130. The RTs look longer for vocalisation, but are probably not significant because of the
wide scatter, but I think the authors should give the mean values in the text.
8. P9 ln 178. Please define LMC
9. Reading the Supplementary material it is clear that different ISIs were tested before settling on
the 20/30s black periods. This fundamental point should be included in the main text.

Review of Koda et al
This paper contrasts the process of voluntary learning in the manual and vocal domains in
Japanese macaques; it is the first to my knowledge to compare learning these two domains
directly using the same methods and species.
This is a useful and important study, and provides a useful quantitative confirmation of
something that has long been noted more impressionistically: that it is much harder for monkeys
to learn vocal operant tasks than other motor. It also provides confirmatory evidence for the
direct connections hypothesis: that direct connections from motor cortex onto the final motor
neurons provides better voluntary control over action. Thus I definitely think the study should be
published.
But I have some suggestions for improvement:
1. More analysis needed:
My main complaint about the current ms is that the data analysis seems quite superficial. I think
the learning curves for the different tasks should be presented in the main text (not SMI), and
perhaps fit by regression to show the different slopes for the different modalities.
For the main ANOVA presented on page 7, it seems based on the degrees of freedom that the
authors treated each call in a session as independent; this isnt really legitimate since the monkey
might well have fast or slow days. So I think these data should be collapsed in some way (e.g. by
session)
I find it very surprising based on the data in Figure 2 that there is no overall difference in reaction
times in the vocal and manual domains: the manual RTs are all around 1 sec with little variance
and the vocal always much more (2-3 secs) with little overlap. I did a simple t-test (on the dryad
data) and got a highly significant difference. Are you sure you did the analysis correctly?
(in any case, a non-significant difference does not mean not different the first paragraph of the
Results should say not significantly different)
2. Overinterpretation:
To me, the interpretation in terms of language evolution seems excessive and speculative, and
somewhat wandering (with the discussion of baby crying). I would rather see a discussion that
stayed closer to the actual data and findings, and some more detailed discussion of previous
research concerning vocal operant conditioning in animals.
3. It is not the case that babies only cry, they also laugh quite early (around 3 months) and this is
another innate human vocalization.
4. Finally, the English needs a lot of work. I can usually tell what the authors are getting at
(though the sentence starting with acquired in the abstract doesnt make sense), but it should be
carefully proofread by a native speaker before resubmission.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting study in which the investigators compared the capacity of Japanese
macaques to learn a reach-to-touch task vs a vocalisation task. The question of whether or not
macaques can learn to generate a vocalisation in response to a visual stimulus is interesting
because of the major differences in macaque vocal behaviour, compared with humans, and the
differences in motor circuitry that may underpin these variations. The study shows that monkeys
can learn, in a closed sound-proof chamber, to generate vocalisations in response to a change in
screen colour (black to red), and to suppress vocalisations during the inter-trial interval. Training
took much longer than the reach-to-touch movement, investigated in two other monkeys. The
researchers proved the establishment of the stimulus-vocal response by showing a statistically
robust relationship between random variations in the duration of the inter-trial period (black
screen, during which the monkeys had to withhold the response) and the timing of the vocal
response.
General comment
This is a potentially novel set of experimental, behavioural observations. However, the training
methodology and criteria are not well-enough described in the present version to make a
compelling paper. The paper could be considerably strengthened and clarified, by giving more
detail about how the study was carried out, and how the data were analysed. More detail is
needed about the vocalisations generated by the monkeys. The english in the paper is s poor, and
it needs to be edited by a scientist whose mother-tongue is english.
Detailed comments
1. P4 ln 59 Control of the forelimb and hand certainly involves direct projections from motor
cortex to motoneurons, but these do not work in isolation from other pathways (see ref 30
Summary Point #5). This should be clarified.
2. P5. The two parts of the experiment seem a bit unbalanced. The objective of the reach-to-touch
task can be assessed by contact with the touch screen. In the vocalisation task, we are not told
anything about the nature of the vocalisations emitted by the monkeys. Were these short single

3. P5. We are not told about what other forms of upper limb movements the monkeys exhibited
during the manual training: for example, what did the monkey do during the (long) periods
when the screen was black? Obviously the monkey could have made all sorts of different
movements, as long as it did not touch the screen. Again, in the vocalisation task, did the
monkeys vocalise at all during the black screen period. If so, did that result in a time-out in the
task sequence?
4. P6 ln106. After completing the vocal/manual training. It is not explained what criterion
/threshold was used to assess whether or not a vocalisation had been made. It is also not
12
explained when training was considered to be complete. Presumably this was the case when a
monkeys responses occurred after the screen change (as indicated by Fig S3e and f), and with a
relatively stable latency (FigS3a and b)?
5. P6 and Fig S3. I do not understand why the number of sessions for completion of training was
57 and 47 trials in Take and Pike, respectively. Indeed, looking at Fig S3d, it looks as though the
monkey was trained much earlier (around sessions 30-35) but then performance deteriorated?
How is the % correct score for sessions 40-57 in Fig S3h reconcilable with the C/F index shown
for these sessions in Fig S3d? I assume it is due to changes in ISI, indicated in FigS1 (Take
data)but these changes need to be indicated in Fig S3.
6. P7 ln 126 reached the criteria: but these criteria are not defined.
7. P7 ln 130. The RTs look longer for vocalisation, but are probably not significant because of the
wide scatter, but I think the authors should give the mean values in the text.
8. P9 ln 178. Please define LMC
9. Reading the Supplementary material it is clear that different ISIs were tested before settling on
the 20/30s black periods. This fundamental point should be included in the main text.

Review of Koda et al
This paper contrasts the process of voluntary learning in the manual and vocal domains in
Japanese macaques; it is the first to my knowledge to compare learning these two domains
directly using the same methods and species.
This is a useful and important study, and provides a useful quantitative confirmation of
something that has long been noted more impressionistically: that it is much harder for monkeys
to learn vocal operant tasks than other motor. It also provides confirmatory evidence for the
direct connections hypothesis: that direct connections from motor cortex onto the final motor
neurons provides better voluntary control over action. Thus I definitely think the study should be
published.
But I have some suggestions for improvement:
1. More analysis needed:
My main complaint about the current ms is that the data analysis seems quite superficial. I think
the learning curves for the different tasks should be presented in the main text (not SMI), and
perhaps fit by regression to show the different slopes for the different modalities.
For the main ANOVA presented on page 7, it seems based on the degrees of freedom that the
authors treated each call in a session as independent; this isnt really legitimate since the monkey
might well have fast or slow days. So I think these data should be collapsed in some way (e.g. by
session)
I find it very surprising based on the data in Figure 2 that there is no overall difference in reaction
times in the vocal and manual domains: the manual RTs are all around 1 sec with little variance
and the vocal always much more (2-3 secs) with little overlap. I did a simple t-test (on the dryad
data) and got a highly significant difference. Are you sure you did the analysis correctly?
(in any case, a non-significant difference does not mean not different the first paragraph of the
Results should say not significantly different)
13
2. Overinterpretation:
To me, the interpretation in terms of language evolution seems excessive and speculative, and
somewhat wandering (with the discussion of baby crying). I would rather see a discussion that
stayed closer to the actual data and findings, and some more detailed discussion of previous
research concerning vocal operant conditioning in animals.
3. It is not the case that babies only cry, they also laugh quite early (around 3 months) and this is
another innate human vocalization.
4. Finally, the English needs a lot of work. I can usually tell what the authors are getting at
(though the sentence starting with acquired in the abstract doesnt make sense), but it should be
carefully proofread by a native speaker before resubmission.

1) In the revised manuscript, the authors acknowledge the relevance of several different muscle
groups in the production of vocalization. I think that the idea that expansion in the cortical
control of those muscle groups was an important aspect of human speech evolution is reasonable.
The authors did a good job discussing it. To be consistent with this systems view, on lines 431-
435, the authors should acknowledge that LMC connection is only one of the possible
neuroanatomical changes that could have led to the emergence of speech and not the only one.
Better control of jaws, lips, tongue, diaphragm were definitely also necessary.

Dear Professor Iriki, our handling editor of Royal Society Open Science
Thank you very much for giving us a great chance to revise our manuscript. We all are very
happy to see generally very constructive comments from all of you, and to revise the
manuscript. Now we completed the revision, and we prepared one pdf file, color-marked
(uploaded as main document) for the rapid review of our revision points. We edited all points
raised by the reviewers, please see my explanations with my revision points below.
Editor comments:
The referees have suggested that the quality of English needs to be improved. A number of
language polishing services are available for authors whose first language is not English. We
recommend that you ask a native speaker of English or solicit the support of a language polishing
service (https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/language-polishing/) prior to resubmitting the

Sorry for our poor English. In fact, to be ashamed, our previous draft has already been
checked by native speaker. Now again, we requested the native checking service to edit the
current version, with the certification of English proofing. We hope you satisfied the current
version. I attached to upload the certifications of native check. Really sorry for this matter.
Reviewer #1
The authors compared the performance of operant conditioned tasks in Japanese macaques when
the monkeys were required to respond manually or by vocalization. The authors central claims
are: (1) the current work is the first to directly compare manual and vocal operant conditioning
tasks (line 148), (2) the poorer performance of the monkeys in the vocal tasks indicates deficit in
motor preparation and/or inhibitory control of vocalization (lines 161-162), (3) evolutionary, the
relevant step was the greater control due to expansion of the direct cortico-motoneuroanal
connections in laryngeal motor cortex. Overall, I think that primate studies on vocalization need
to be reproduced more times and studied with more care, and this study might fit that category.
We really appreciate your insightful evaluations. As you know, vocal training studies in
monkeys is really time-consuming study; first, we have to meet a "good" monkeys to vocalize
spontaneously much, and further train them to vocalize with careful observations. Otherwise,
most monkeys dropped out due to failure of learning. Our study is the same case. We really
spent much time on training. However, the questions for the vocal controllabilities could be
not testable without completion of the training. This is the reason why most people hesitate
this attempts. I guess you seem to understand inadequate numbers of these studies, and happy
to share the impression on the research importances.
Nevertheless, (1) this study is not the first one to make a direct comparison between manual and
vocal operant conditioning tasks, (2) the logic of the study is not well-thought, (3) the manuscript
is missing several key articles, and (4) the conclusions are largely exaggerated. I will detail my
concerns below.
Thanks for criticized suggestions for the overalls of our study. Especially, we completely
missed to follow and discuss the quite important study by Sutton et al (Honestly, I completely
mistook to check this comparison paper between vocal or lever press action. Really thanks!).
Additionally, I agreed with necessary to mention the key paper, which you kindly raised in
the comments below. Finally, I agreed with your claims for exaggerations of tentative
conclusions. Now we toned down to rephrase the discussion sections, based on our
observation of the experimental data (See my replies below for details of my major revised
points). The speculative discussion for link with cry were removed in this revision. I believe
our manuscript was much improved now.
1. The current work is not the first one to directly compare the manual and vocal operant
conditioning tasks. For example, Sutton et al. - Vocal and Nonvocal Discriminative
Performance in Monkeys - Brain and Language (1981) trained in a discriminative task the
same monkey to respond using vocalization or manual responses. The authors should cite
this article and other related ones in the manuscript and should drop the claim of primacy
should. The authors of this manuscript will note that Sutton et al. (1981) already showed
that the delay for vocal response is longer compared to manual response. Nevertheless,
different from the current manuscript, Sutton et al. (1981) argue that there is no intrinsic
difficulty on monkeys to learn to respond vocally to operant conditioned tasks.
Thanks for your expertized comments. Now we referred to include this literature. Indeed,
Sutton study has already compared the vocal and manual tasks, and further revealed similar
results of the performance differences of the reaction times, which are likely consistant with
our results. In terms of difficulty in vocal performance, our results is consistent with the
Sutton study. However, our results provided more advanced ones; we showed the difficulty
particularly in the sudden change to the shorter retention times, not in longer times. This
performances was found in vocal task, not in touch task. We believed the fundamental
differences of the motor control or control learnability between vocal and manual with more
advanced ways.
2. On a similar note, the authors should read and cite Pierce - A Review of Attempts to
Condition Operantly Alloprimate Vocalizations - Primates (1985). Pierce reviewed 12
works in which macaques are conditioned to vocalize. There is an interesting discussion of
why some authors might have had difficulty in training the monkeys to vocalize
conditionally. Pierce (1985) proposes an "ecologically-appropriate hypothesis" to explain
the results of 12 operant conditioning experiments for vocal production. The following is
from the conclusion in Pierce (1985) "This hypothesis proposes that an understanding of
artificial environment behavior is predicated upon a knowledge of behavior in the natural
environment. Experiments incorporating appropriate contexts and social reinforcers into
the artificial experimental situation yielded the best results."
I think we should update the view of the history for vocal operant conditionings, and believe
we should refer the paper as new as possible to avoid the confuse the latest views of primate
vocal volitional control, we focused only on the latest reviews by Sage's Nature Rev NS
(2017), which is finely covering the previous attempts and reviews with the recent progress
and confirmed evidence of the brain systems, of course, including Pierce works. This is
because we did not mention it in the last version of manuscript. However, we agreed with
your comment, and include the important review paper by Pierce (1985).
3. Although there are few claims in the literature that it is more difficult to train a monkey to
produce vocalization in operant conditioned tasks, there are dozens of studies showing
successful training of monkeys to produce vocalization in conditioned tasks, since at least
Myers (1965). Those studies suggest that the difficulty is not necessary in the monkey, but it
could be in the experimenter or experimental setup. It is a possibility that the authors should
consider.
Now we acknowledged "ecologically-appropriate hypothesis", proposed by Pierce, as a
possible reason why monkeys usually take a longer time to learn the vocal operant
conditioning tasks than non-vocal tasks. In the previous manuscript, we mentioned nothing
for this previous view, so now we referred it. Following your comments, we add a sentence;
"the difficulty in the vocal tasks would not necessary due to the monkey's motor abilities, but
it might be in the experimenter or experimental setup", in the discussion section.
4. In general, it is difficult to determine the reason why the monkeys took longer to learn the
task, why the response latency was longer, and why the animal performed worse in the
probe task when vocalization was required. Therefore, the authors should consider the other
possibilities that explain the results. It is clear that behavior does not exist in isolation. It
also depends on the context, motivation, and biomechanics. A vocalization is usually
produced during social interaction, which is not necessarily the case for manual responses.
Therefore, it is possible that the operant conditioned setup used by the authors are
inadequate to motivate the animal. One evidence for the inadequacy is that the animals were
trained without seeing the experimenter. Probably the authors' rationale was to avoid
experimenter bias, but it is likely that such an approach made more difficult for the animal
to learn the vocal task, but not necessary the manual task. Sutton et al. (1981) and Pierce
(1985) use similar reasoning to explain why some authors might have difficulty in training
the monkeys on conditioned vocal responses.
Yes, we agreed with your comments. Our data is the evidence, but not direct confirmations
for the reason for the training difficulty of the vocal tasks, just a possible
hypothesis/explanations of the limitations of the motor control neural circuits. In this regard,
we mentioned another possibilities, mainly raised by the reviewer 1, a possibility of the
inappropriate settings for the vocal training. Now we clearly added this explanation in the
revision, and further a possible future solutions if we improved our methods. This suggestion
really improved our discussion. Thanks.
5. Moreover, the longer delay in responding could be solely related to the biomechanics of
vocal production. To produce a vocalization, the animal has to use the respiratory system,
laryngeal system, tongue, mouth, lips, etc, in coordinated fashion. It is likely that the
monkey's reaction time is longer simply because it takes more time to couple these body
parts. The respiratory cycle for example is an obvious element that constraints the timing of
vocalization, because the monkeys can only produce calls during expiratory cycles. The
respiratory constraint would explain why the monkeys had worse performance in the probe
tests when the inter-trial intervals were shorter. The authors should consider these
possibilities.
Many thanks for this great comment! I agreed with your notion for the deep influences of the
respiratory cycle on the vocalization (for all mammals, respiratory action is the deep roots of
the vocal actions!). As you mentioned above, many parts of action control are overlapped
between vocal and respiratory actions (e.g., larynx and lung). Recent papers of marmosets by
xxx (2016) also mentioned the respiration cycle is a part of fundamental motor actions,
determining the vocal characters. Now we updated to add these discussions of respiratory
cycles for a possible reason explaining the difficulty of the vocal trainings.
6. Other factors that are known to reduce vocal production are head or body restraint,
different positioning of the body, water/food restriction. All of the listed factors affect vocal
behavior differently from manual behaviors. Please, take into account these possibilities
Now I included the possible factors, such as different positioning of the body or rewards
types, which would influence the vocal trainings. Particularly, rewards types would be a key
factor according to Pierce (1985) review work, where he mentioned social reward such as
vocal reply likely enhance the vocal training more strongly than food reward. I acknowledged
the study limitations of our approaches.
7. We also know that the age of the animal has an influence on the rate of conditioned vocal
production, Hage et al. - Developmental changes of cognitive vocal control in monkeys -
Journal of Experimental Biology (2016). If the animals can produce calls in an operant
conditioned tasks when they are juveniles, why they would stop when older? The most
parsimonious explanation is that they can learn, but don't have the motivation or condition
to produce, which could be the case for the animals of this manuscript (although I did not
find the ages of the animals).
In any case, it is necessary to be careful on the conclusion that the poorer performance of
the monkeys in the vocal tasks indicates a deficit in motor preparation and/or inhibitory
control of vocalization.
Actually, I knew this recent study for the age influence on the training success of the
vocalization in monkeys, and wondered if we included to refer it. Now, following your
suggestion, we included this paper. For the age effect, our subjects were also similar ages
with the Sage JEB paper, and partially we agreed with their tentative conclusions. As you
pointed out, motivations would be a key factor for the smooth success of the vocal trainings.
We clearly mentioned this possible factor and discussions.
8. Similarly, the authors' conclusion that their results are evidence for the necessity of a direct
cortico-motoneuroanal connections in laryngeal motor cortex does not hold. As mentioned
above the first reason is that it is not clear that the source of the poorer performance of the
monkeys on vocal tasks is due to neural constraints. Second, human speech capacity is
definitely not due only to constraints in laryngeal control. Formants are acoustic features
that characterize human speech and the same formants can be produced with different
laryngeal membrane oscillations, i.e., different laryngeal muscle tensions. That is because
the primary source of formant shapes is the filtering of the sound by the supralaryngeal
vocal tract. Hence, tongues and mouth shapes are as important as or maybe more important
than the fine control of the larynx (small changes in the frequency are not relevant). A clear
example is a whispering sound in which there is a reduced or no laryngeal membrane
oscillation but still allows to establish a conversation. Hence, the hypothesis that laryngeal
muscle control is the necessary evolutionary step is doubtful at best (for more arguments
against the LMC hypothesis see for example Lameira - Neurosci Biobehav Rev (2017)).
Finally, it is highly unlikely that a single reason, e.g., increased connectivity from LMC to
nucleus ambiguus, can explain the evolution of speech, let alone the evolution of language.
Yes, you are correct. Speech is, no doubt, unique for humans, but it is not only due to single
origins, especially not due to the evolutionary shift of laryngeal mussel control from monkeys
to humans. As you mentioned above, the control of supralarnygeal vocal tract shapes is a
important part which is necessary for emergence of speech capacity or language. In the
discussion of the revision, I carefully add to mention the another components which are
necessary for speech evolution, referring the recent good review of Lameria (2017), and
discuss the possible evolutionary history for the speech as the integrations of the multiple
primary components abilities.
9. Overall, the manuscript needs a significant rewriting, taking into account the other
explanations for the findings, acknowledging the caveats, and citing the other studies on
conditioned vocalizations (e.g. Sutton et al., 1981; the studies cited in Pierce ,1985).
We really appreciate your expert comments and suggestions. Particularly, suggestions for the
many important landmark papers are helpful for us to improve much our manuscripts. I hope
you satisfied our improved versions.
Reviewer #2
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting study in which the investigators compared the capacity of Japanese
macaques to learn a reach-to-touch task vs a vocalisation task.
Thanks for great evaluation.
The question of whether or not macaques can learn to generate a vocalisation in response to a
visual stimulus is interesting because of the major differences in macaque vocal behaviour,
compared with humans, and the differences in motor circuitry that may underpin these variations.
The study shows that monkeys can learn, in a closed sound-proof chamber, to generate
vocalisations in response to a change in screen colour (black to red), and to suppress
vocalisations during the inter-trial interval. Training took much longer than the reach-to-touch
movement, investigated in two other monkeys. The researchers proved the establishment of the
stimulus-vocal response by showing a statistically robust relationship between random variations
in the duration of the inter-trial period (black screen, during which the monkeys had to withhold
the response) and the timing of the vocal response.
Really thanks for perfect understanding our approaches in this study even though it was a bit
complicated. I appreciate for your careful reading our manuscript.
General comment
This is a potentially novel set of experimental, behavioural observations. However, the training
methodology and criteria are not well-enough described in the present version to make a
compelling paper. The paper could be considerably strengthened and clarified, by giving more
detail about how the study was carried out, and how the data were analysed. More detail is
needed about the vocalisations generated by the monkeys. The english in the paper is s poor, and
it needs to be edited by a scientist whose mother-tongue is english.
Sorry for the poor English. Now our manuscript was re-checked by the native English editing
service. For the detailed descriptions of the methodolgy, I improved to carefully describe the
method sections. Particularly, criterions (for the success trials of the vocal task, and for the
successful learning of the vocal tasks) were carefully explained in the methods.
Detailed comments
1. P4 ln 59 Control of the forelimb and hand certainly involves direct projections from motor
cortex to motoneurons, but these do not work in isolation from other pathways (see ref 30
Summary Point #5). This should be clarified.
Thank for the kind suggestions. I carefully rephrased it, mentioning the both contributions of
direct and indirect projections to the forelimb control, which is contrast with the monkey
vocal motor control.
2. P5. The two parts of the experiment seem a bit unbalanced. The objective of the reach-to-
touch task can be assessed by contact with the touch screen. In the vocalisation task, we are
not told anything about the nature of the vocalisations emitted by the monkeys. Were these
short single cries or maintained?
First, we always faced the limited numbers of the subject monkeys, as you may also
experienced. We sometimes meet a "clever" monkeys to learn the difficult tasks, but often
challenge with the "difficult" monkeys to do nothings due to quite low motivations. However,
we must do to reach an result or tentative conclusion within the limited condition of primate
experiments. "Unbalanced" settings were mainly due to the difficulty of the vocal trainings.
As I mentioned the supplementary information files, first we tried to train them with 30-
seconds restraint times (ITIs) for both subjects (Pike and Take). The early phase of the
training in Take, she seemed to learn the tasks as we expected. However, she could not
improved the performances, after the retention times was prolonged. Therefore, we gave up
the matching of the parameters of task setting. Simultaneously, we started the touching task
for the two monkeys, but we faced with the difficulty of the perfect matching of the training
methods, because we could not already matched the training parameters in the vocal tasks.
The complete matching of the task schedule and parameters should be planned for the direct
comparisons of learning progress, but we could not do the perfect matching because of the
limitations of subjects (if we had more subjects, of course we would had tried the matching in
the training) and difficulties of the vocal tasks (if we continued to training Take with the
same parameters with Pike, Take's vocalizations decreased down due to the negative impacts
on her motivations). Therefore, we decided the probe test after the completions of the both
task, to compare the task performances. In probe task, we could match the task schedule
except for the ITIs. Additionally, you have a concern for the vocalizations to be reinforced. In
this time, we reinforced a single coo call for both Pike and Take. In case that the inter-call-
interval(offset-to-offset) was less than 100 msec, these calls were a single call. We added the
information in the method.
3. P5. We are not told about what other forms of upper limb movements the monkeys exhibited
during the manual training: for example, what did the monkey do during the (long)
periods when the screen was black? Obviously the monkey could have made all sorts of
different movements, as long as it did not touch the screen. Again, in the vocalisation task,
did the monkeys vocalise at all during the black screen period. If so, did that result in a
time-out in the task sequence?
As I explained in the methods, the monkeys were required to stop the actions (vocalization
for vocal task, and touching for manual task). As you mentioned, they could not stop
especially in the early phase of training (see xxx). Importantly, they could stop the touching,
but could not the vocalizations even when the training proceeded (we believe this is the main
differences of the motor control between vocal and manual). Unfortunately, we recorded only
the touching by the touch screen device, not the other body actions such as bounding, and
therefore we could say nothing for the other body actions. For the black screen period in
vocal task, they could not sometimes stop the vocalizations in the latter phase of the vocal
training task, but the numbers of that "failed" vocalizations decreased as the performances
improved during the training progress. I carefully added to explain them in the methods, and
results section.
4. P6 ln106. After completing the vocal/manual training. It is not explained what criterion
/threshold was used to assess whether or not a vocalisation had been made. It is also not
explained when training was considered to be complete. Presumably this was the case when
a monkeys responses occurred after the screen change (as indicated by Fig S3e and f), and
with a relatively stable latency (FigS3a and b)?
Sorry for immature descriptions (or poor English expression). Now we explained the two
criterions for the completion of the training, which were the C/F index considering both
successful actions and numbers of unappropriated actions during the black screen phase, and
the simple correct rate. If monkeys perfectly react for the red screen presentations(100%
correct rate), it was insufficient for our criterions. We additionally required them to
appropriately stop the reactions during the black phase. The simple correct rate was for the
assessment of the understanding of motor executions, and C/F index is the scores considering
both of execution and inhibition performances. Indeed, the simple correct rate would be easy
for the simple assessment. However, particularly in the vocal trainings, both monkeys never
decreased the number of the vocalization during black screen phase. When seeing at Figure
S3e/f, this scores in vocal were around over 10 (this means 10 * 30 trials = 300 calls occurred
in black screen phase!) even in 40-th sessions in Pike and in 45-th sessions in Take. This is
great differences of the progress between vocal and manual. Therefore we considered this call
numbers as C/F index. We guess this is the fundamental differences for the action control
between vocal and manual. Here we used C/F index for the assessment of the training, and
did not used latency data. As you pointed out, interestingly, the latencies are relatively stable
(as in FigS3a and b). Further as following Rev 3's comment, our re-analysis for the latencies
of vocalization and touching reported the differences; touch was more rapid than
vocalizations. We do not say anything for that strongly, but in the revision we mentioned the
stable patterns of the latencies, and its differences between vocal and manual actions. In the
revision, we additionally mentioned the criterions and reported the interesting differences for
these "false" actions during black phase between vocal and manual trainings (but it would be
a just implications for the discussion.)
5. P6 and Fig S3. I do not understand why the number of sessions for completion of training
was 57 and 47 trials in Take and Pike, respectively. Indeed, looking at Fig S3d, it looks as
though the monkey was trained much earlier (around sessions 30-35) but then
performance deteriorated? How is the % correct score for sessions 40-57 in Fig S3h
reconcilable with the C/F index shown for these sessions in Fig S3d? I assume it is due to
changes in ISI, indicated in FigS1 (Take data)but these changes need to be indicated in
Fig S3.
Please see FigS3h between 30 and 37, for the correct rate(%) of Take. Indeed, C/F index
reached our criterions, 0.7, but actually during these sessions, the overall numbers of Take's
vocalizations were extremely low (we do not know why her motivations suddenly
decreased.... This often occurred for this vocal training... So difficult to maintain the
motivation consistently....), and therefore the correct rate was very low (under 70%, and
sometimes 0-20%!). Therefore, we could not decide Take reached the criterions,
unfortunately. I explained these data progress in the supplementary information results.
6. P7 ln 126 reached the criteria: but these criteria are not defined.
As I answered above, now I carefully mention and explained the criterions in the revisions.
7. P7 ln 130. The RTs look longer for vocalisation, but are probably not significant because of
the wide scatter, but I think the authors should give the mean values in the text.
Sorry. I found a significant differences by GLMMs. I added the statisticas for the RT data in
the revisions.
8. P9 ln 178. Please define LMC
Sorry. Indeed, there were no definition for LMC. I guess it disappeard during my draft editing
(Actually first I defined!). Now I added the explanations.
9. Reading the Supplementary material it is clear that different ISIs were tested before settling
on the 20/30s black periods. This fundamental point should be included in the main text.
Thanks! I moved some important method informations in the main text.

Review of Koda et al
This paper contrasts the process of voluntary learning in the manual and vocal domains in
Japanese macaques; it is the first to my knowledge to compare learning these two domains
directly using the same methods and species. This is a useful and important study, and provides a
useful quantitative confirmation of something that has long been noted more impressionistically:
that it is much harder for monkeys to learn vocal operant tasks than other motor. It also provides
confirmatory evidence for the direct connections hypothesis: that direct connections from
motor cortex onto the final motor neurons provides better voluntary control over action. Thus I
definitely think the study should be published.
I really appreciated your evaluations. As you may image, this training is really tough works
for us in the limited resources of the animal subjects. I guess we shared the importance of this
sort of data. I am really encouraged by your comments.
But I have some suggestions for improvement:
1. More analysis needed:
My main complaint about the current ms is that the data analysis seems quite superficial. I
think the learning curves for the different tasks should be presented in the main text (not
SMI), and perhaps fit by regression to show the different slopes for the different modalities.
Many thanks for the suggestion. Now I included the results of the training progress in the
main text not in SMI. For the fitting by regression analysis, it might be great idea, but I
did(should) not performed our data because the C/F index were the summarized point score
for each session (no SD and mean!), and further the simple regression lines. The curves of the
touch tasks are more difficult to fit by regressions (small session numbers, and sometimes
there was a "valley" score in correct rates, 4th session of Look). We simply reported the
result in the main text, not SMI. For reaction time data, we performed to reanalysis it by the
glmm (see below).
For the main ANOVA presented on page 7, it seems based on the degrees of freedom that the
authors treated each call in a session as independent; this isnt really legitimate since the monkey
might well have fast or slow days. So I think these data should be collapsed in some way (e.g. by
session)
Now I re-analyzed the data of the probe test by glmm considering the session as a randam
factor. Here we used lme4 and lmerTest packages to estimate the parameters of fitted models,
considering session as a random factors. Again found the same results of the previous Anova.
Note that df were sometimes variable around session numbers in the new anova test based on
the glmm fittings by lmerTest packages. This is the usual in the case that the unbalanced
numbers of the data points. In our case, the numbers of the baseline trials were more frequent
than those of probe trials. Therefore, the dfs were not fixed values (see help files of lmerTest,
especially for the descriptions of "Satterthwate's approximations"). I hope you satisfied these
tests.
I find it very surprising based on the data in Figure 2 that there is no overall difference in
reaction times in the vocal and manual domains: the manual RTs are all around 1 sec with little
variance and the vocal always much more (2-3 secs) with little overlap. I did a simple t-test (on
the dryad data) and got a highly significant difference. Are you sure you did the analysis
correctly?
(in any case, a non-significant difference does not mean not different the first paragraph of the
Results should say not significantly different)
Many thanks for suggestions for the re-analysis. Now we updated the reaction time data by
glmm considering subject and sessions. Now we found the significant differences for the
reaction times between vocal and touching in the training session! We updated the results.
Interestingly, this is the consistent with the previous data by Sutton (1981), suggested by
Reviewer #1. This suggestion improved and supported our observation much stronger! Many
thanks for suggestions!
2. Overinterpretation:
To me, the interpretation in terms of language evolution seems excessive and speculative,
and somewhat wandering (with the discussion of baby crying). I would rather see a
discussion that stayed closer to the actual data and findings, and some more detailed
discussion of previous research concerning vocal operant conditioning in animals.
Personally, I like the discussion connecting to the human cries, but I agreed with your
scientific suggestion: we must stay closer to the actual data. I rephrased (reduced) the last
discussion paragraph of connections with human cries. Alternatively, we put the discussion of
the study limitations related to task settings in the several parts of the discussion section,
which were mainly suggested by reviewer 1.
3. It is not the case that babies only cry, they also laugh quite early (around 3 months) and this
is another innate human vocalization.
We added this important suggestion.
4. Finally, the English needs a lot of work. I can usually tell what the authors are getting at
(though the sentence starting with acquired in the abstract doesnt make sense), but it
should be carefully proofread by a native speaker before resubmission.
Every reviewers all requested us the native check, and the current version was checked by
native speaker. Sorry for poor English.
Thank you very much for all comments, and now we really felt our manuscript was much
improved. we hope we could politely answer, and rewrite all concerns you raised here, but we
am willing to continue reediting if you still find concerns again. we do whatever we can do to
make it acceptable for Royal Society Open Science. We really appreciate your editorial
efforts, and look forward to seeing your decisions soon.
With best wishes,

Dear Professor Atsushi Iriki, our handling editor
We wish to submit our re-revised manuscript entitled "From hand to mouth: Monkeys
require greater effort in motor preparation for voluntary control of vocalisation
than for manual actions".
We really happy to see the initial acceptance with your very positive evalutaion comments on
our revised efforts. We also belive that our manuscript was improved much. Now we reivised
one minor point to mention the importance of the other motor componets related to
vocalizations (see, LL. 383-386). For your quick understanding, we uploaded the PDF files
marking the revision parts.
Thank you for the good dicussions for the data we treated in this paper. I look forward to
hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Hiroki Koda
