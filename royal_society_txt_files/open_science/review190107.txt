The authors present a study in which they compared the techniques of long jumpers with and
without a unilateral transtibial amputation. They focused on studying three amputees that have
competed in the Paralympics and jump using the prosthesis as the take-off leg. These athletes
were then compared to seven non-amputee athletes. They did this by recording motion capture
and force plate data during the take-off step and calculating full body kinematics using a
mathematical rigid body model. From their research, they find that, while both amputees and
non-amputees displayed similar performance, they used different strategies for producing their
greatest distances. Amputees experienced a longer compression phase at the start of the take-off
step, kept their intact joints much stiffer, and had a lower COP distance from their center of mass.
This paper is well written and well reasoned and I such I believe it is worthy of publication after a
few minor edits and clarifications.
Revisions (relevant line numbers are shown):
115-120: Where both amputee and non-amputee subjects present at both locations (GSU and
JISS)? This seems necessary to mention as there were differences in data collection at the two
sites. If the two groups had data collected at separate locations, could that affect the results?
150-152: What are the 16 segments of the model? A citation that includes a detailed description of
the model and/or labeled segments in the figure would be helpful. If there is no previous study
to cite, the authors may need to write a supplementary section describing the model. I would
also recommend they post the data and code for the study.
155: The modeled prosthesis joint should be labeled in figure 1. Describing the location becomes
much clearer with a picture.
177: How does landing technique influence the information gathered at take-off?
187: The study cited here gives no extra information on the statistical technique used. From what
I can gather from the p values reported throughout the Results section, the null hypothesis
always assumes the data sets are the same. While I am admittedly not and statistical expert, the
stats throughout the next section were hard for me to follow.
Results section general comment: I found the statistics to be difficult to understand. Why was the
decision made to state the p value in the middle of the comparison, e.g. A > (p = 0.05) B, rather
than at the end, e.g. A>B (p=0.05)?
223-226: The authors suddenly begin using “significantly different” to compare groups. This is
not consistent with previous or future paragraphs. I recommend removing “significantly” or
adding it where appropriate to other comparisons.
247-258: Results here lack stats as opposed to all other measures. If there is a reason for the
omission, the authors should be explicit.
3
292: “…indicating that their leg is not as rigid…” This statement can be a bit confusing depending
on if the reader includes the prosthesis as a part of the leg or not as previously you state “…they
resist knee flexion more…” The authors should consider being explicit throughout this section
when speaking about the “whole leg” or the “lower leg.”
306: If the ability to tolerate high impact force is a predictor of performance for a non-amputee,
wouldn’t a stiffer spring on an amputee (as suggested earlier) be counter-productive?
383-385: Does a lower frequency in motion capture data affect the smoothness of the data as well?
If so, wouldn’t the two different capture frequencies at GSU and JISS affect the results?
401-404: This sentence is hard to understand. Is this statement saying that amputees who jump
off their unaffected limb do not stiffen like those who jump off their affected limb?
Figures and Tables:
Most figures report distance in meters (except for two plots in Figure 3) while Table 2 reports in
cm. I realize this is done for the most part based on scale, but I’d recommend at least changing
Figure 3 for consistency in units.

General comments
Overall this is an interesting article with some novel results. A few methodological issues need to
be clarified. I feel that the main improvements would come from shortening the results section
and improving the discussion of the mechanical processes underpinning the jump takeoff in able
bodied and amputee athletes.

Specific comments
Line 62 - insert 'Male' between 'for' and 'athletes'
Lines 126-127 - Presumably these anthropometric measurements were used to create a geometric
model of the body for inertia parameter calculation and CoM location, could you specify which
one you used?
Lines 156-157 - Did you establish how well the rigid body model fitted the prosthesis - e.g. how
close were the markers to the model joint, assuming invariant segment lengths and endpoints?
Lines 163-165 - How were COM position and velocity calculated? From the inertia model
throughout, or from initial position and velocity estimates from the inertia model at touchdown
and integration of force data? The latter would seem a more accurate estimate, or at least useful
to establish whether the two methods agree.
Lines 193-194 - The jump distances were essentially equivalent between groups based on
projectile motion, however horizontal and vertical velocities at takeoff were higher in non-
amputees (Table 2), amputee athletes would require a substantially higher takeoff position to
result in similar jump distances, can you explain this?
Line 193-272 - The results section is long and repeats a lot of the information from the tables and
figures. I think this should be briefer and try to restrict the text to highlighting the most extreme
or noteworthy findings, rather than reporting most of the data which is already presented in
tables and figures. These can be covered in the discussion. Ideally the tables would have some
indication of different p-value levels for comparisons between groups.
lines 289-295 - The implication here seems to be that a more rigid prosthesis would be beneficial
for a jump takeoff, due to a more effective pivot, however a stiffer prosthesis may result in more
flexion of the knee which inevitably results in energy loss due to the force velocity relationship of
muscle (i.e. they produce more force - and hence lose more energy - eccentrically than
concentrically). A prosthesis which returns nearly all the energy it stores is more effective than an
intact limb, even if it results in more overall shortening of the limb, and especially if it facilitates
less flexion of the knee joint. If an intact limb athlete took off from a springboard the effect would
likely be similar, the longer compression phase would facilitate lower GRFs and consequently
less energy loss due to joint flexion, and a more efficient velocity conversion when the energy
was returned. Stiffening a prosthesis to mimic intact limb leg stiffness would be like choosing to
stiffen the springboard to the same level as the ground, which would likely result in poorer
performance due to greater energy losses.
Lines 321-325 - I would contend that movement strategies are the similar between amputees and
non-amputees, both are trying to resist knee flexion and therefore energy loss, and use hip
extension to add energy to the CoM, but the prosthesis facilitates this more effectively due to
reduced GRFs.
Lines 398-401 - As previously mentioned, shortening of the leg due to prosthesis deformation is
unlikely to be deleterious, so should not need compensating for.
Lines 464-465 - Although long jump performance was similar between groups (although this
needs clarifying, see question re lines 193-194 above), approach velocity was lower in amputee
athletes so it is likely their takeoff technique is more effective and any limitations of the prosthesis
may have manifested themselves in the approach run.

Revisions (relevant line numbers are shown):
115-120: Where both amputee and non-amputee subjects present at both locations (GSU and JISS)?
This seems necessary to mention as there were differences in data collection at the two sites. If the
wo groups had data collected at separate locations, could that affect the results?
We understand your concerns. However, there was no group-location assignment. Eight
athletes (two with and six without BKA) were tested at the German Sport University Cologne
(GSU), two athletes (one with and one without BKA) were tested at the Japan Institute of
Sport Sciences. We agree that the location of data collection might affect the results. To
minimize the effect, two researchers from GSU (first and second author) traveled to Japan
for data collection and to ensure standardization of procedures. In both locations, a Vicon
system and Kistler forces plates were used.
We added the required information and rewrote as follows:
We changed:
“Data collection was conducted at the German Sport University Cologne (GSU) and the Japan
Institute of Sport Sciences (JISS).”
To:
“Data collection was conducted at the German Sport University Cologne (GSU, six athletes with
and two without BKA) and the Japan Institute of Sport Sciences (JISS, one athlete with and one
without BKA).”
150-152: What are the 16 segments of the model? A citation that includes a detailed description of the
model and/or labeled segments in the figure would be helpful. If there is no previous study to cite, the
authors may need to write a supplementary section describing the model. I would also recommend
hey post the data and code for the study.
We are thankful to the reviewer for pointing out this lack of information. We added the
required information and rewrote as follows:
We changed:
“A mathematical rigid full body model (Dynamicus, Alaska, Institute of Mechatronics,
Chemnitz, Germany) consisting of sixteen segments was used for kinematic calculations for the
non-amputee athletes.”
To:
“A mathematical rigid full body model (Dynamicus, Alaska, Institute of Mechatronics,
Chemnitz, Germany) consisting of sixteen main segments was used for kinematic calculations
for the non-amputee athletes. The segments comprised: head, trunk, as well as left and right:
upper arm, lower arm, hand, thigh, shank, rear foot, forefoot. The trunk consisted of several
sub-segments.“
As stated at the end of the method section, additional, for this study relevant, details on the
mathematical model (e.g., joint center definition) and calculation of jump distance are in our
previous paper Willwacher et al. (2017).
Unfortunately, we cannot upload marker coordinate data or the model used. This is due to
our small sample size and that we cannot guarantee the anonymity of subject-specific data.
As we said, all models for the athletes with BKA are adapted individually. This also means
that it includes personal measurements. E.g. residual shank length etc.
However, we have uploaded all model output files which were used for parameter calculation.
155: The modeled prosthesis joint should be labeled in figure 1. Describing the location becomes
much clearer with a picture.
Thank you for this suggestion. We agree and added a label to Figure 1, highlighting the
position of the prosthetic joint. We also changed the figure caption accordingly.
177: How does landing technique influence the information gathered at take-off?
As mentioned in the methods section we eliminated the influence of landing technique on
long jump performance by calculating the theoretical jump distance.
We do not expect that the landing technique will influence the information gathered at take-
off.
On the other side, the technique used during the flight phase (e.g. run or hang) could
influence landing technique. In the current study we did not capture the actual landing, but
only a limited range of 2-3 meters behind the take-off board. Therefore, stating influences of
the technique used during the flight phase on landing technique would be pure speculation
and would be beyond the scope of this paper. However, we agree that this might be
important for athletes and coaches and should be subject of further research. Personally,
we did not observe differences in landing or flight technique between athletes with and
without BKA. However, inter-individual differences appear in both groups.
187: The study cited here gives no extra information on the statistical technique used. From what I can
gather from the p values reported throughout the Results section, the null hypothesis always assumes
he data sets are the same. While I am admittedly not and statistical expert, the stats throughout the
next section were hard for me to follow.
It is correct that the null hypothesis assumes no difference between groups. We cited our
previous publication (Willwacher et al., 2017) because we used the same statistical procedure,
a Wilcoxon test and 10% error margin.
We added the required information as follows:
“We assumed that the null hypothesis was indicated as no difference between groups.”
Results section general comment: I found the statistics to be difficult to understand. Why was the
decision made to state the p value in the middle of the comparison, e.g. A > (p = 0.05) B, rather than at
he end, e.g. A>B (p=0.05)?
Thank you for this comment. We understand the issue. We tried to move the position of the
p-value to the end of the sentence or statement wherever possible without causing confusion.
223-226: The authors suddenly begin using “significantly different” to compare groups. This is not
consistent with previous or future paragraphs. I recommend removing “significantly” or adding it
where appropriate to other comparisons.
We agree. We removed „significantly“ for consistency.
247-258: Results here lack stats as opposed to all other measures. If there is a reason for the omission,
he authors should be explicit.
We thank the reviewer for highlighting this inconsistency. We added p-values.
292: “…indicating that their leg is not as rigid…” This statement can be a bit confusing depending on
f the reader includes the prosthesis as a part of the leg or not as previously you state “…they resist
knee flexion more…” The authors should consider being explicit throughout this section when
peaking about the “whole leg” or the “lower leg.”
Thank you for pointing this out. We agree and rephrased to make it clearer.
We changed:
Resisting knee flexion would allow athletes to keep their leg stiff, providing a stable lever.
To:
Resisting knee flexion would allow non-amputee athletes to keep their leg stiff, providing a
stable lever.
This underlines that non-amputees can stiffen their whole leg by resisting knee flexion.
306: If the ability to tolerate high impact force is a predictor of performance for a non-amputee,
wouldn’t a stiffer spring on an amputee (as suggested earlier) be counter-productive?
We did not intend to implicate that the prosthesis should be stiffer and have rephrased the
sentence to make it clearer.
We changed:
“Because leg stiffness is dictated by RSP stiffness during running [28], use of a stiffer
prosthesis by an athlete with BKA could increase leg stiffness during the long jump take-off
step, but may also impair the elastic energy storage and return within the leg.”
To:
“Because leg stiffness is dictated by RSP stiffness during running [28], use of a stiffer
prosthesis by an athlete with BKA could increase leg stiffness during the long jump take-off
step. However, a stiffer prosthesis might impair the elastic energy storage and return within the
leg and result in higher impact forces leading to increased knee flexion. Therefore, prosthetic
stiffness likely influences long jump performance and should be subject of future research.”
383-385: Does a lower frequency in motion capture data affect the smoothness of the data as well? If
o, wouldn’t the two different capture frequencies at GSU and JISS affect the results?
With a capturing frequency of 250Hz, we chose a sampling frequency which guarantees to
cover the frequency content of such a highly dynamic motion as the take-off step in the long
jump. Similar frequencies were used in current research on sprint running (Alt et al 2015,
Judson et al 2018). We thus can not only guarantee to keep all kinematic information but we
were also able to use a low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 50 Hz. With 500 Hz we cover
the same content of information and because of an adequate and consisting filtering regime,
we don’t expect any relevant differences.
401-404: This sentence is hard to understand. Is this statement saying that amputees who jump off
heir unaffected limb do not stiffen like those who jump off their affected limb?
Yes, Nolan et al. 2012 showed that athletes with BKA who take-off from their affected leg
have a stiffer knee compared to athletes with BKA who take off from their unaffected leg.
This comparison is similar to our comparison between athletes with BKA who take-off from
their affected leg and non-amputee athletes.
Figures and Tables:
Most figures report distance in meters (except for two plots in Figure 3) while Table 2 reports in cm. I
ealize this is done for the most part based on scale, but I’d recommend at least changing Figure 3 for
consistency in units.
We agree and now all figures display distances in cm to be consistent with Table 2.
We also slightly changed the scaling of two sub-figures in Figure 3 and corrected minor
imprecisions in Table 2.

General comments
Overall this is an interesting article with some novel results. A few methodological issues need to be
clarified. I feel that the main improvements would come from shortening the results section and
mproving the discussion of the mechanical processes underpinning the jump takeoff in able bodied
and amputee athletes.
Specific comments
Line 62 - insert 'Male' between 'for' and 'athletes'
We added „male“ accordingly
Lines 126-127 - Presumably these anthropometric measurements were used to create a geometric
model of the body for inertia parameter calculation and CoM location, could you specify which one
you used?
The anthropometric data were used to individually adapt the „Dynamicus“ model (Alaska,
Institute of Mechatronics, Chemnitz, Germany)
The Dynamicus model provides limited information about the underlying inertial and CoM
calculations. However, calculations are mainly based on the following references:

Lines 156-157 - Did you establish how well the rigid body model fitted the prosthesis - e.g. how close
were the markers to the model joint, assuming invariant segment lengths and endpoints?
The markers defined the position of the model joint. Thus, agreement of the marker position
should be the same for every joint.
Lines 163-165 - How were COM position and velocity calculated? From the inertia model
hroughout, or from initial position and velocity estimates from the inertia model at touchdown and
ntegration of force data? The latter would seem a more accurate estimate, or at least useful to
establish whether the two methods agree.
COM position was calculated from the Dynamicus model. Velocity then was calculated by
differentiation of the COM position using a three-point method to avoid shortening the data
set by one frame.
We added:
„COM velocity was calculated by mathematical differentiation of the COM position throughout
the entire stance phase.“
Lines 193-194 - The jump distances were essentially equivalent between groups based on projectile
motion, however horizontal and vertical velocities at takeoff were higher in non-amputees (Table 2),
amputee athletes would require a substantially higher takeoff position to result in similar jump
distances, can you explain this?
Take-off velocities in anterior-posterior and vertical directions were not significantly
different between groups (p=0.667 and p=1.000, respectively). Therefore, athletes had the
same average jump distances. As stated in the caption of Table 2, significant differences are
indicated by bold values. Also, vertical COM position at TO was not different between groups
(p=0.833).
Line 193-272 - The results section is long and repeats a lot of the information from the tables and
igures. I think this should be briefer and try to restrict the text to highlighting the most extreme or
noteworthy findings, rather than reporting most of the data which is already presented in tables and
igures. These can be covered in the discussion. Ideally the tables would have some indication of
different p-value levels for comparisons between groups.
We agree that a briefer results section would be easier to read. However, most of the values
presented in the results section are p-values and percentage differences. These data are not
presented in the tables. Further, the tables present an extensive amount of data. Thus, we
split the information between the text and tables.
We carefully went through the result section and were able to shorten a few sentences
without losing information.
We changed:
“Athletes with BKA reached their maximum knee flexion (MKF) at 52.7 <U+F0B1> 2.5% of the stance
phase during the take-off step, which was later (p=0.017) compared to the non-amputee athletes,
who reached MKF at 43.8 <U+F0B1> 4.9% of the stance phase of the take-off step.”
To:
“Athletes with BKA reached maximum knee flexion (MKF) in their take-off leg later during the
take-off step compared to the non-amputee athletes (nonAMP: 43.8 <U+F0B1> 4.9%, BKA: 52.7 <U+F0B1> 2.5%,
p=0.017).”
We changed
For the first 42.2 <U+F0B1> 5.8% of the stance phase the vertical COM position of athletes with BKA was
below their vertical COM position at the instant of TD (Figure 2). This was a longer relative time
duration (p=0.017) compared with non-amputees (first 17.2 <U+F0B1> 3.9% of the stance phase).
To:
In athletes with BKA the vertical COM position was below their vertical COM position at TD for
a longer relative duration of ground contact compared with non-amputee athletes (nonAMP:
17.2 <U+F0B1> 3.9%, BKA: 42.2 <U+F0B1> 5.8%, p=0.017).
We changed
“At the instance of MKF, the COM of both groups of athletes was posterior relative to the COP,
but the COM of athletes with BKA was ~13 cm closer (p=0.017) to the COP compared to the
non-amputee athletes.”
To
“At MKF, both groups had their COM posterior relative to their COP, but athletes with BKA had
their COM ~13 cm closer to their COP compared to non-amputees (p=0.017).
ines 289-295 - The implication here seems to be that a more rigid prosthesis would be beneficial for a
ump takeoff, due to a more effective pivot, however a stiffer prosthesis may result in more flexion of
he knee which inevitably results in energy loss due to the force velocity relationship of muscle (i.e.
hey produce more force - and hence lose more energy - eccentrically than concentrically). A
prosthesis which returns nearly all the energy it stores is more effective than an intact limb, even if it
esults in more overall shortening of the limb, and especially if it facilitates less flexion of the knee
oint. If an intact limb athlete took off from a springboard the effect would likely be similar, the longer
compression phase would facilitate lower GRFs and consequently less energy loss due to joint flexion,
and a more efficient velocity conversion when the energy was returned. Stiffening a prosthesis to
mimic intact limb leg stiffness would be like choosing to stiffen the springboard to the same level as
he ground, which would likely result in poorer performance due to greater energy losses.
We did not intend to implicate that the prosthesis should be stiffer and have rephrased the
sentence to make it clearer.
We changed:
“Because leg stiffness is dictated by RSP stiffness during running [28], use of a stiffer
prosthesis by an athlete with BKA could increase leg stiffness during the long jump take-off
step, but may also impair the elastic energy storage and return within the leg.”
To:
“Because leg stiffness is dictated by RSP stiffness during running [28], use of a stiffer
prosthesis by an athlete with BKA could increase leg stiffness during the long jump take-off
step. However, a stiffer prosthesis might impair the elastic energy storage and return within the
leg and result in higher impact forces leading to increased knee flexion. Therefore, prosthetic
stiffness likely influences long jump performance and should be subject of future research.”
Lines 321-325 - I would contend that movement strategies are the similar between amputees and non-
amputees, both are trying to resist knee flexion and therefore energy loss, and use hip extension to add
energy to the CoM, but the prosthesis facilitates this more effectively due to reduced GRFs.
Thank you for this suggestion. We only partly agree here. Even though it would be
beneficial for both athletes to keep the knee stiff, only the use of a prosthesis enables the
athlete to do so. Knowing this, athletes with BKA alter their strategy and rely on energy
storage and return in the prosthesis.
The question of effectiveness (advantage/disadvantage) was stressed in our previous paper
(Willwacher et al., 2017 entitled: „Elite long jumpers with below the knee prostheses
approach the board slower, but take-off more effectively than non-amputee athletes“) and
therefore is not discussed again in the current paper.
However, based on your suggestion we rephrased a sentence in the conclusion section.
We changed:
On the other hand, in the present study we show that long jumpers with BKA are unable to
actively control their lower leg or regulate the stiffness of their leg during the take-off step due
to the mechanical constraints of the prosthesis.
To:
“On the other hand, in the present study we show that, due to the mechanical constraints of the
prosthesis, long jumpers with BKA are unable to actively regulate their lower leg stiffness and
have to regulate the stiffness of the whole leg by reducing knee ROM during the take-off step.”
Lines 398-401 - As previously mentioned, shortening of the leg due to prosthesis deformation is
unlikely to be deleterious, so should not need compensating for.
We understand your concerns and deleted this sentence.
Lines 464-465 - Although long jump performance was similar between groups (although this needs
clarifying, see question re lines 193-194 above), approach velocity was lower in amputee athletes so it
s likely their takeoff technique is more effective and any limitations of the prosthesis may have
manifested themselves in the approach run.
Thank you for this comment. Please see the previous answer for the first part of your
comment (jump distances). We agree with the second part of your comment. In our previous
paper (Willwacher et al., 2017 entitled: „Elite long jumpers with below the knee prostheses
approach the board slower, but take-off more effectively than non-amputee athletes“) we
highlighted that long jumpers with BKA approach the board slower but take off more
effectively. As discussed before, we did not stress this in the current paper again.
