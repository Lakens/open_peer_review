The contribution represents a new Early Cretaceous pliosaurid with a peculiar combination of
features. Results presented herein are significant for several reasons: first, they provide important
information for a poorly known period in the evolutionary history of pliosaurs; second, peculiar
morphology of its feeding apparatus (i.e. tooth morphology plus aleveolar and mandibular
pattern) permit to explore the diversity of feeding strategies among Cretaceous top predators;
and third, the presence of a pliosaur with a tooth morphology previously identified only for
marine ziphodont metriorhynchids raises questions about the survival of geosaurins up to the
Albian.
The results are well supported by the phylogeneic analyses. Quite interesting is that authors
explore different strategies of data analysis and, in this way, test their own results.
I think that this contribution will be of interest not only for plesiosaur specialist but, un a broad
sense, for people interested in marine tetrapods evolution.
I recommend the publication of this contribution after minor revision.
Minor comments and suggestions:
Introduction and comparison. A recent described Pliosaurus from north-west Patagonia
(Pliosaurus patagonicus Gasparini and O’Gorman 12014) is not included in the comparisons (and
the contribution is not cited) Maybe it could be worthy to include this species as it is quite
complete (mandible plus skull)
Page 3. A central topic of this contribution is based on tooth morphology (and therefore feeding
strategies). They only mention true or false ziphodont without providing citations and/or
definition of what they consider true vs false ziphodont. This topic could be expanded and/or
literature (especially those referred to the definition of different tooth morphologies of
metriorhychids. e.g. Andrade et al. 2010) could be added

This is a well written paper and the conclusions are reasonable. I have only a few remarks.
The paper takes for granted that this is a pliosaur, which I do not doubt, but for a more general
scientific audience it should be stated why this specimen is a pliosaur and not a metrirhynchoid
crocodylomorph. The title is also a little confusing, why is this pliosaurid so peculiar? this needs
to be addressed more clearly.
The naming of the Genus and species is not according to the nomenclatural acts as they have not
been registered in ZooBank, the online registration system for the ICZN (International Code of
Zoological Nomenclature). This is not amendatory for fossil vertebrates yet, but a good system to
follow. According to ZooBank already several different species of animals are named rossica.
The plates could be better executed, the map is very sketchy, and the texts on the photographic
plates are not in any way aligned. A small schematic drawing of the animal with highlighted
bones preserved will also be very useful.

Keywords: Pliosauridae, Macrophagy, Ecology, Cretaceous, Convergence
Abstract: During the Middle and Late Jurassic, pliosaurid plesiosaurs evolved gigantic body size
and a series of craniodental adaptations that have been linked to the occupation of an apex
predator niche. Cretaceous pliosaurids (i.e. Brachaucheninae) depart from this morphology,
being slightly smaller and lacking the macrophagous adaptations seen in earlier forms. However,
the fossil record of Early Cretaceous pliosaurids is poor, concealing the evolution and ecological
diversity of the group. Here, we report a new pliosaurid from the Late Hauterivian (Early
Cretaceous) of central Russia. Phylogenetic analyses using reduced consensus methods recover it
as the basalmost brachauchenine. This pliosaurid smaller than other derived pliosaurids, has
tooth alveoli clustered in pairs and possess trihedral teeth with complex serrated carinae.
Maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstruction suggests early brachauchenines retained
trihedral teeth from their ancestors, but modified this feature is a unique way, convergent with
macrophagous archosaurs or sphenacodontoids. Our findings indicate that Early Cretaceous
marine reptile teeth with serrated carinae cannot be unequivocally assigned to metrirhynchoid
crocodylomorphs. Furthermore, they extend the known diversity of dental adaptations seen in
Sauropterygia, the longest-lived clade of marine tetrapods.

patagonicus when relevant and have added this reference to the bibliography.

and/or literature (especially those referred to the definition of different tooth morphologies of
metriorhychids. e.g. Andrade et al. 2010) could be added
 We agree; we have added three references discussing the types of ziphodonty and their
definitions. The type of ziphodonty (true or false one) can only be verified by making
destructive cross-section, which we did not attempt because of the scarcity of the limited
sample of large functional tooth available in the holotype. Because we cannot assess the type
of ziphodonty in Makhaira, we think it is unnecessary to markedly expand this part of the
manuscript. We have also modified the text in the description to make it clear.

identified in Makhaira has, to our knowledge, no equivalent in marine tetrapods.

lineages such as metriorhynchoids, mosasaurs, and now a pliosaurs but not for all Mesozoic

 This is totally correct, but the concluding sentence of that paragraph was more general
than just the serration of tooth crowns (as reflected by the papers we cite there: Massare 1987
[1]; Kelley & Motani 2015 [2]). The identification of a “metriorhynchid-like” tooth shape in a
pliosaur exemplify and further document the general phenomenon of convergence among
Mesozoic marine reptiles as a whole. We thus prefer to leave the sentence as it is rather than
be more specific.

I am not quite convince on the scoring of Gallardosaurus. The original description (Gasparini
2009) mention trihedral teeth not subtrihedral. She mentioned not 1 flat surface but that 1
surface (at least) bears smooth ridges. I don´t think that scoring this feature different in
Gallardosaurus will change the results but seems more parsimonius as there is only one origin
for subtrihedral teeth (in P. kevani and P. cd. Kevani)
 We note that the formal description and definition of subtrihedral teeth is more recent [3]
than the paper of Gasparini 2009 [4]. Previously, pliosaur teeth that were not subcircular were
commonly regarded as trihedral, probably by default. Personnal observations detailed in
Benson et al [3] suggest Gallardosaurus had subtrihedral, not strictly trihedral teeth.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a well written paper and the conclusions are reasonable. I have only a few remarks.
The paper takes for granted that this is a pliosaur, which I do not doubt, but for a more general
scientific audience it should be stated why this specimen is a pliosaur and not a
metrirhynchoid crocodylomorph.
 While convergent evolution in the tooth crown might indeed blur the affinities of this
specimen, every aspect of its anatomy is unambiguously pliosaur-like, as evidenced notably
by the dorsal surface of the mandible, the number of premaxillary alveoli, subcentral
foramina, extensive girdle elements, etc. We feel that adding such a paragraph on this topic
would make the manuscript less focused.
The title is also a little confusing, why is this pliosaurid so peculiar? this needs to be
addressed more clearly.
 The title refers to the peculiarity of its diet-related adaptations, hitherto unknown in
Sauropterygia. This point is abundantly discussed in the paper, notably in the introduction,
description and discussion. Also, the presence of procumbent anterior teeth is highly unusual,
being only found in another new pliosaur from Russia that is markedly distinct from
Makhaira (Fischer et al, in prep). We prefer to keep the title as it is, for conciseness.
The naming of the Genus and species is not according to the nomenclatural acts as they have
not been registered in ZooBank, the online registration system for the ICZN (International
Code of Zoological Nomenclature). This is not amendatory for fossil vertebrates yet, but a
good system to follow. According to ZooBank already several different species of animals are
named rossica.
 Thank you for this sensible suggestion. We have registered Makhaira rossica and the
paper in ZooBank. LSIDs have been added in the Systematic description section. We note that
taxonomic names in the species group are quite often widespread, such as seeleyi, robustus,
gracilis, etc.
The plates could be better executed, the map is very sketchy, and the texts on the
photographic plates are not in any way aligned. A small schematic drawing of the animal with
highlighted bones preserved will also be very useful.
 We have modified the map (Figure 1), by using lighter colors and reducing the number of
localities to those that have provided marine reptile fossils. We have also modified the figures
2-4, by aligning the text as much as possible. We have added a skeleton reconstruction as
suggested, in Figure 4 and have modified the figure caption accordingly.
small mistake in abstract: p2 l9 should be "feature in a unique".
 Indeed, we have modified the text accordingly.
In addition to these changes, we have also double-checked the text for typos, modified the
specimen number to YKM 68249/1-10 (YKM B-6102) was a temporary number. We have
also added a table with measurements in the supplementary information (Table S1).
