It is an interesting paper, it is always welcome to see different applications of aptamers.
Please explain or describe the aptamer selection, from the paper it seems the aptamer has been

The authors describe a novel method for fast detection of cocaine. They also report high
sensitivity. However, there are some issues that should be clarified.
1. In the text, the authors state that they first conjugate the aptamer with FDP and then
immobilize the hybrid molecule onto magnetic beads. According to Fig 1b, the first step is
conjugation of free aptamer onto magnetic beads. Which one is correct?
2. How did the authors calculate the LOD value?
3. The method should be validated using a standard method and recovery% should be given.
4. Which buffer was used for the hybridization between FDP and ADP ? Is buffer 2 compatible
with interaction between cocaine and the aptamer? In the methods section, the buffer used in
each step should be indicated separately.
5. In Table 1, the terms FDP and ADP should be replaced by more clear ones. In particular, ADP
is the common abbreviation for adenosine diphosphate. That causes confusion.
6. More detailed information about design of probes should be given. For example, how did the
authors determine the length of hybridization seuquence (the sequence indicated bold in Table 1)
7. The detection method also includes the preparation step of aptamer-conjugated magnetic
beads (MBs). What is the stability of MBs? Otherwise, the time required for MB preparation
should also be considered when calculating the detection time.
8. What is the experimental yield of aptamer conjugation and aptamer-FDA hybridization
process? Is the yield consistent between different experiments?
9. Did the authors observe the release of FDP in real-time fluorescence measurements? How did
they decide on a 10-min incubation for competition?
10. In Fig 5, the authors show the reproducibility of the protocol? Does the graph show the results
obtained from regeneration of fiber surface and measuring the same FDP sample consecutively ?
Does the reproducibility involve the whole process from the beginning? It should be indicated in
the figure caption.
11. The authors should mention about the reference 43 more and the authors should make a
comparision between that previous publication and current manuscript.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
It is an interesting paper, it is always welcome to see different
applications of aptamers.
1. Please explain or describe the aptamer selection, from the paper it
seems the aptamer has been chosen from literature so please make
this clear.
Answer:
The aptamer of cocaine was the same as MNS-4.1 in the literature
(Neves, et al., 2010; Roncancio, et al., 2014). The dissociate
coefficient of the aptamer is 7 ± 1 µM. We cleared the design of the
aptamer by adding the references.
Revise:
(1) L89-90:
The aptamer for cocaine is selected from literature with
dissociated coefficient (Kd) as 7 ± 1 µM [34, 35].
(2) L416-421, Ref 34-35:

structural requirements of a cocaine-binding aptamer by a thermodynamic and
mutation study. BIOPHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, 2010, 153, 9-16.
2. There is the mention of piranha solution, this is sulfuric acid and
hydrogen peroxide, please use the chemical name and not the
common one.
Answer:
We added a notation for piranha solution to describe the
components for better understanding. “Piranha etch solution” was used
to emphasize the function of the reagent as glass surface cleaning and
hydroxylation.
Revise:
L117-119:
Firstly, a multi-mode quartz optic fiber in diameter 600 mm was
immersed into piranha solution (30% hydrogen peroxide in
concentrated sulfuric acid in v/v=1:3) for 1 h to clean and hydroxylate
the fiber surface.
3. The paper uses ewf, it is an interesting technique and it would be
appropriate to add a paragraph explaining it and why it is applicable
for this project, specially as there are biosensors based on cocaine
aptamers using fluorescence and colorimetric methods already.
Answer:
(Taitt CR, et al., 2016) reviewed the advances of EWF in the
decade of 2005-2015 after the first review paper (Taitt CR, et al.,
2005), illustrating the history, development, application and future of
EWF. Actually EWF is currently a matured technique to de small
molecules in a wide array of applications, such as environmental and
drinking water analysis, food testing, clinic diagnosis, and etc.
We agreed that cocaine can currently be quantified via many
transducers based on the aptamer recognition. The method by
fluorescence spectrometer, colorimetry, illuminance, electronics, and
so on, as we cited in the paper, have been successfully developed.
Anyway, considering EWF potential and advantage of
commercialization as a general platform in the wide range of
applications, it is meaningful to demonstrate the feasibility of simple
EWF to detect cocaine. So we think our study is a small but necessary
step to expand the application of such technology.

Taitt, C. ; Anderson, G. ; Ligler, F. Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 2016 (76),
103-112.
Revise:
(1) L73-75:
Here, we proposed an aptamer-based protocol to rapidly detect
cocaine in a wide working range on an evanescent wave fiber (EWF)
biosensor[30-32], which has been a matured technology to detect small
molecules in a wide array of applications [33].
(2) L175-180:
Briefly, a laser beam with a wavelength of 535 nm was generated
by a pulsed diode and introduced to the optic fiber via total internal
reflection, which can generate evanescent waves at the fiber surface.
The fluorophores of FSP-AAP on the fiber surface were excited by the
evanescent waves and emitted the 556 nm fluorescence. The
fluorescence was partly transmitted back into the optic fiber and
captured by the photodiodes.

biosensors: Advances of the last decade. Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 2016, 76,
103-112.
4. Has this aptamer complex being challenged with molecules
structurally similar to cocaine?
Answer:
The selective recognition of cocaine by the aptamer has been well
proved from abundant analogues by previous studies, e.g., a paper by
(Reinstein O, et al., 2013), although our selectivity experiment has not
covered the many molecules with similar structures. So we had not
repeated the experiments as in the reference, but examined the
specificity of cocaine detection from the possibly co-existed typical
pharmaceutic agents as our previous study (Tang, et al, 2016).
However, quinine, an anti-malaria drug that often added in liquor,
could combine the aptamer more effectively. The dissociation constant
is 7± 1 µM for aptamer-cocaine, while that for aptamer-quinine is 0.23
± 0.003 µM (Reinstein O, et al., 2013). Therefore, quinine is a strong
interference to the analysis. If quinine was used together with cocaine
in the sample, the analytical results would be higher than actual value.
Anyway, considering that quinine and cocaine are not often co-existed,
the method is still feasible for cocaine detection if quinine usage can
be excluded.
We revised the text to add above information.

C. J.; Johnson, P. E. BIOCHEMISTRY, 2013, 52, 8652-8662.
Revise:
(1) L267-268:
Quinine, which was once used to treat malaria and is still using in
tonic water, compete the aptamer with strong affinity [41], thus
quinine usage should be excluded before the detection.

and Hydrodynamic Analysis of High-Affinity Binding of an Off-Target Ligand.
BIOCHEMISTRY, 2013, 52, 8652-8662.
5. Has there been any more conclusions regarding the kinetics? if so,
please ad them as it is relevant.
Answer:
First order kinetics was used to explain the dynamic feature of
EWF signals, and saturation model was applied to explain the
competitive-affinity mechanisms. For the purpose of simple calibration,
semi-log fitting was used to correlate the EWF signals and the cocaine
concentrations.
We concluded the kinetics in abstract and conclusions.
Revise:
(1) L20-21, Abstract:
The dynamic curves of EWF signals were interpreted by the first
order kinetic model.
(2) L285-286, Conclusion:
Saturation model and the first order kinetics were successfully
applied to interpret the dynamic EWF signals.
6. Figure 1 has magnetic beads and the fibers, please explain this
concept a bit more, the figure is very good but it does not explain
why both systems are there.
Answer:
We are sorry for this confusion. The magnetic beads and optic
fibers were used in separate steps. Figure 1 was modified to explain
the three steps of protocol. We hope it can clear the possible confusion
to the readers.

and release FSP; (c) Detection step to quantify the released FSP via
fluorescence by evanescent wave excitation on the fiber surface. FSP
is fluorescence labelled probe for quantification, and AAP is
complimentary probe to anchor FSP on the fiber surface.
7. The excel files in the suppl data are very helpful, it would be better
to add the graphs too.
Answer:
The raw data in dryad are usually in .csv files, which one can not
embed figures inside. In order to include the figures, we changed the
file type from .csv to .xls to include the figure. The data file in dryad
was also updated.
Revise:
The dryad data were updated. Please using following link to visit
the data.
https://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.1j7g2k8
Some of the figures in the excel files are shown as below.
8. References, please check, some journals are with capital letters and
some not, some abbreviations are ok and some are not.
Answer:
We corrected the format of references according to the Journal’s
requirement.
Revise:
We revise the reference in red color.
9. The paper mentions that one of the applications of biosensors are
based on sample preparation, but the study was done only on buffer
and not any biological matrices, has this been done and
contemplated? If not, then that affirmation should be removed
because there is not supportive data for that claim.
Answer:
We had not conducted the cocaine analysis in biological matrices
in this paper. It is necessity to validate the method by using actual
samples, but unfortunately we are lack of such kind of data currently.
We had a plan to optimize the biosensor to reduce the background
signal and also to precede actual sample, which might be available in
the future works.
We removed the sentences related with practical analysis, and
hope that the work is still valuable for the readers.
Revise:
(1) L68-71:
In order to decouple the process kinetics, a systematical scheme is
requested including high quality of reagents, effective control of
environmental conditions, and sophisticated models for data
interpretation.
(2) L254-256:
Anyway, it is necessary to reduce the background signal in further
study, as well as to examine effects of matrices in actual samples by
the standard method with recovery rates.
(3) L286-287, conclusion:
The calibration curve in buffer covered a wide working range
from 10 µM to 5000 µM by using the semi-log function for data
fitting.
10. Is there any comparison for quantification with mass
spectrometry?
Answer:
In genearl, LC-MS showed much higher LODs and analytical
duration than biosensors. For example, LC-MS/MS can achieve LOD
of cocaine at 0.7-1.5 ng/mL (Silveira, et al., 2016), and GC-MS has
LOD at 6 ng/mL (Takitane, et al., 2018) in the very recent studies.
We included above references and revised the discussion on
LODs.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors describe a novel method for fast detection of cocaine.
They also report high sensitivity. However, there are some issues that
should be clarified.
1. In the text, the authors state that they first conjugate the aptamer
with FDP and then immobilize the hybrid molecule onto magnetic
beads. According to Fig 1b, the first step is conjugation of free
aptamer onto magnetic beads. Which one is correct?
Answer:
We’re sorry for the confusion between the graph and the text. The
Aptamer-FDP is firstly prepared, and then immobilized on the MBs, so
the explanation in text is correct. The scheme figure was not updated
before submitting the manuscript.
We corrected the Scheme for better illustrating the different steps
of the protocol.

and release FSP; (c) Detection step to quantify the released FSP via
fluorescence by evanescent wave excitation on the fiber surface. FSP
is fluorescence labelled probe for quantification, and AAP is
complimentary probe to anchor FSP on the fiber surface.
2. How did the authors calculate the LOD value?
Answer:
The LOD was calculated according to the rule of 3s of the
triplicate blank samples. The average read out of triplicate blank
sample was 67.4 ± 0.5 mV, so that the signal of LOD was determined
as I0 = 67.4 + 3×0.5 =68.9 mV. By using the calibration curve of I
=63.4 log c +4.0, the LOD (as c) was calculated 10.5 µM.
We modified Figure 2a by breaking the x axis to include the data
of blank samples together with other data in log-axis. Dash line and
arrow are used to illustrate how to determine the LOD.

3. The method should be validated using a standard method and
recovery% should be given.
Answer:
In this paper, we attempted to simplify the tackle operation of
all-in-one sensors into matured and separated steps with good
robustness, using the data in buffer solution as evidence to support the
feasibility.
We agreed on the necessity of validating the method by recovery
test using actual samples. Unfortunately, currently we are lack of such
kind of data. We had a plan to optimize the biosensor to reduce the
background signal and also to precede actual sample, which might be
available in the future works. Anyway, according to the focus and
scope of this paper, we hope the current work still valuable for the
readers who have struggled for a long time in using biosensors in
actual application.
We revised the perspective and conclusions.
Revise:
(1) L254-256:
Anyway, it is necessary to reduce the background signal in further
study, as well as to examine effects of matrices in actual samples by
the standard method with recovery rates.
(2) L286-287, conclusion,
The calibration curve in buffer covered a wide working range
from 10 µM to 5000 µM by using the semi-log function for data
fitting.
4. Which buffer was used for the hybridization between FDP and
ADP ? Is buffer 2 compatible with interaction between cocaine and
the aptamer? In the methods section, the buffer used in each step
should be indicated separately.
Answer:
We are sorry for the confusion on buffer solutions.
During the optic fiber analysis, the supernatant with buffer 2
(reaction buffer) was directly injected into the fiber chamber. Buffer 2
was design as reaction buffer to support both the cocaine competition
and the detection by FDP-ADP (new FSP-AAP). The component of
buffer 2 was slightly modified from the literature (Zuo, 2012). Other
buffer solution followed our previous study (Tang, 2016).
A section of buffer solution in Supplementary materials was
added for better understanding, as well as saving the length of text. We
tried to clarify the buffer solutions in each step in the section of
methods, e.g., explained buffer 1 & 2 in “section 2.2 Conjugation of
aptamer-FSP”, and noted buffer 3 & 4 to “section 2.3 Fabrication of
optic fibers”. Necessary references were added in the text.

(3) Method 1: Buffer solutions
There are four kind of buffer solutions prepared for the cocaine
analysis. Buffer solutions were all prepared from reagent grade
chemicals with Millipore ultrapure H2O. Buffer 1 (hybridization buffer)
was used for the solid surface cleaning and aptamer conjugation at pH
7.5, containing 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris in HCl and 1 mM EDTA.
Buffer 2 (reaction buffer) was prepared for the cocaine competition at
pH 7.4, which consisted of 25 mM Tris in HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM
KCl and 5 mM MgCl2. Buffer 3 (regeneration buffer) was 0.5% (v/v)
SDS in water at pH 1.9 for the fiber surface regeneration. Buffer 4
(washing buffer) was 10 mM PBS at pH 7.4 for cleaning of optic fiber
surface.
5. In Table 1, the terms FDP and ADP should be replaced by more
clear ones. In particular, ADP is the common abbreviation for
adenosine diphosphate. That causes confusion.
Answer:
We are sorry for the confusion caused by the term of ADP.
In the revised paper, AAP are used to take place of ADP to
abbreviate Amino modified Anchor DNA Probe. The term of FSP was
still used as the abbreviation of Fluorescence labeled Short DNA Probe.
The terms of ADP and FDP all through the paper has been modified to
AAP and FSP respectively.

6. More detailed information about design of probes should be given.
For example, how did the authors determine the length of
hybridization seuquence (the sequence indicated bold in Table 1)
Answer:
The aptamer has been reported in the literature. We designed FDP
and AAP to accompany with the aptamer to recognize cocaine and
transduce the signal. The length of nucleotides (nt) of the probe can
greatly affect the performance, which number is usually 8-20 nt. We
selected 12 nt in the end of the aptamer, thus the probe will be released
after aptamer combined with cocaine.
Twelve T bases were added in the aptamer sequence to keep the
aptamer and FDP away from the surface of MBs to avoid possible
useless combination. Biotin at the end was designed to connect the
streptavidin group pre-coated on the surface of MBs.
Six T bases were designed in AAP to make sure the position of
fluoropore (Cy3) in the FDP-AAP affinity is close enough to the fiber
surface for fluorescence detection.
To save the length, we prepared a paragraph in Supplementary
Materials to explain the design of the probes in Table 1.
Revise:

The aptamer for cocaine is selected from literature with

Detail information of sequence design is in Supplementary P1.
(3) Supplementary P1: Sequence design
We designed FDP and AAP to accompany with the aptamer to
recognize cocaine and transduce the signal.
1. Aptamer. The aptamer has been reported in the literature (Ref.
37, 38). Twelve T bases were added in the aptamer sequence to keep
the aptamer and FDP away from the surface of MBs to avoid possible
useless combination. Biotin at the end was designed to connect the
streptavidin group pre-coated on the surface of MBs.
2. FDP. The length of nucleotides (nt) of the probe can greatly
affect the performance, which number is usually 8-20 nt. We selected
12 nt in the end of the aptamer, thus the probe will be released after
aptamer combined with cocaine. Fluorophore Cy3 was tailored at the
end of FDP.
3. AAP. Six T bases were designed in AAP to make sure the
position of fluoropore (Cy3) in the FDP-AAP affinity is close enough
to the fiber surface for fluorescence detection.
7. The detection method also includes the preparation step of
aptamer-conjugated magnetic beads (MBs). What is the stability of
MBs? Otherwise, the time required for MB preparation should also
be considered when calculating the detection time.
Answer:
Long-time storage will destroy the activity of structure and the
sensitivity of biosensor. For aptamer-based biosensors, the simple
chemical composition favors aptamer the stability for a long time.
Moreover, loading aptamer-based structure on the surface of magnetic
beads (MBs) is a matured method to maintain the active state of the
biosensor for a long time. In a reference cited (Xiang, et al, 2011) as
Ref. 4 in this paper, the feasible duration of the aptamer-invertase on
MBs has been carefully studied. As Figure S8 in the reference (also
shown below), the activity of aptamer-based structure to recognize
cocaine has not changed after storage under 4oC for 14 days.
Xiang, Y.; Lu, Y. Using personal glucose meters and functional DNA sensors to
quantify a variety of analytical targets. Nature Chemistry, 2011, 3, 697-703.
MBs loading is a matured and well-established method and we
followed the standard procedure, so we had not checked the stability of
MBs. Because invertase is an enzyme to catalyze sucrose to glucose,
it’s more easily to lose the activity. Considering the sensing structure
in this study contains only aptamers and Oligonucleotide, we thought
the duration of MB-aptamer activity should be at least 14 days. This
advantage favors the end-users’ free choice on the analytic schedules.
Consequently, the preparation time of MB-aptamer was not included in
the detection duration.
We add one sentence to explain the stability of MBs.
Revise:
L111-112:
The activity of MB-aptamer would not be obviously changed
after storage at 4oC for at least two weeks [4].
8. What is the experimental yield of aptamer conjugation and
aptamer-FDA hybridization process? Is the yield consistent between
different experiments?
Answer:
Sometimes, in case of samples in very small volume, it is quite
difficult to quantify the production of each reaction step during
analysis. However, it is necessary to analyze the intermittent product
of key step to control the quality of test. In this paper, we designed to
monitor the released FDP after competition by a fluorescence
spectrometer. The result is shown in Figure 1a.
A saturation model was applied to fit the data and to estimate the
maximum FDP as 17 nM (Figure 2b), which represents the theoretical
FDP on the magnetic beads. . After diluting the aptamer-FDP
conjugant in MB (0.2 µM) for 10 times, the theoretical high limit of
FDP was 20 nM to be possibly released to the supernatant. Therefore
the yield of aptamer conjugation could be calculation by dividing the
maximum 17 nm over the theoretical 20 nM, equal to 85%.
The consistency of the yield is also a serious concern. First, we
followed a standard and simple procedure to prepare the
MB-aptamer-FDP conjugants. The well-established method ensured
that the operation is robust and the bias should be limited. Second,
similar with instrumental analysis, standard calibration curve is
recommended for each massive analysis. The periodic calibration is
useful to control the data quality, even there is different yield between
analyses. Although we had not checked the consistency of the yield,
we thought it would not be a serious challenge to our protocol.
Revise:
(1) L132-133:
After diluting the aptamer-FSP conjugant in MB (0.2 µM) for 10
times, the theoretical high limit of FSP was 20 nM to be possibly
released to the supernatant.
(2) L198-199:
The maximum FDP (17 nM) implied that the yield of
MB-aptamer-FDP conjugation was 85%, considering the theoretical
limit of FDP was 20 nM.
(3) L219-223:
The increasing signal of the blank sample in Figure 3a implied
interferences from the sample matrix, the instrumental noise,
transducer bias, and the environmental variation. Thus, reducing the
signal background could effectively improve the LOD of the EWF
platform, which should be the further task. Currently, periodic
calibration of EWF biosensor is recommended to control the data
quality.
9. Did the authors observe the release of FDP in real-time
fluorescence measurements? How did they decide on a 10-min
incubation for competition?
Answer:
It would be convincible to use real-time fluorescence
measurements of the released FDP during the competition.
Unfortunately, due to the very limited volume of the sample and
reagents (< 1 mL), currently we could not acquire the dynamic FDP
releasing curve by common instrumental analysis. It’s a good idea to
study the dynamic releasing curves to further understand the details of
the competition.
Although quantitative data are not available, the duration of
competition is determined according to reference and our lab
experience. DNA-DNA hybridization on the solid surface can reach
equilibrium in a few minutes when there are less than 100 base pairs
(Kick, et al., 2010). Aptamer and cocaine interaction occurred very
quickly, e.g., reaction of cocaine with aptamers in solution can get
equilibrium in less than 60 s in our previous study (new Ref. 20). Thus,
10 min of incubation is supposed enough for the aptamer and cocaine
competition.
It’s helpful to save detection time if the incubation time could be
optimized to be less than 10 min by further studies. Anyway, 10 min is
enough for reaction and such optimization is beyond the scope of this
paper.
We revised the text to clarify the reason of 10-min.

Does the graph show the results obtained from regeneration of fiber
surface and measuring the same FDP sample consecutively? Does
the reproducibility involve the whole process from the beginning? It
should be indicated in the figure caption.
Answer:

competition, measuring and fiber regeneration. The samples were not

11. The authors should mention about the reference 43 more and the
authors should make a comparison between that previous
publication and current manuscript.
Answer:
In our previous study in Ref 43 (new Ref 20), two tailored
aptamers were used to recognize cocaine by forming a “sandwich”
structure. The fluorophore group in the one aptamer can be quenched
by the tailor in another quencher aptamer. Thus, reduction of the
fluorescence intensity at evanescent wave optic fiber (EWF) can be
used to quantify the cocaine. The biosensor of all-in-fiber type is
successful on its rapid response, for the reaction of cocaine with
aptamers can get equilibrium in less than 60 s.
There are also some disadvantages that are associated with the
all-in-fiber strategy to improve. First, the calibration range is lower
than 200 µM. Second, the kinetic model is complicated using
4-parameter logistic equation. Third, the aptamer is prepared in liquid
and difficult for long-term storage.
In this work, we used matured method of magnetic beads to load
the aptamer-based sensing structure. Thus the calibration range was
extended for 25 times larger to 10-5000 µM. Simple and linear
equation was possible to explain the kinetics. The prepared
MB-conjugant can be stored for over two weeks. Although the LOD is
higher than previous study as the price, it is also feasible for rapid
screening scenarios.
We include the Ref 43 (as new Ref 10) into Table 2 for
comparison. Comparison and discussion were provided in the text.
Revise:

For example, 4-parameter logistic model was used in our previous

Our previous study achieved 450 s for cocaine analysis using
split-aptamer on EWF biosensor [20], but skilled operation is required

Our previous all fiber biosensor can detect 0.165 µM of cocaine
in serum [20], but the working range is limited below 200 µM and
skilled operation is required.
