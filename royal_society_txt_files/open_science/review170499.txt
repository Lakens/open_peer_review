The finding of a three dimensionally preserved drepanosauromorph skull is unique and of great
scientific significance, the description is well written, consistent and complete, even if I would
have liked adding line drawing of the reconstructed skull.
I have made some remarks in the text that should be adressed: reading the manuscript it seeems
that this is the first time that binocular vision and enlarged brain are proposed for
drepanosauromorphs, but indeed both were already suggested by Renesto and Dalla Vecchia
(2005, see comments in the text for details); Clearly the descritpion of a three dimensionally
preserved skull is of much greater significance, and I recommend its publication because it gives
a much stronger evidence. Also the new details about squamosal-quadrate complex and stapes
are essential to reliable phylogenetic studies of the group. Other minor comments are in the pdf
attached. (Appendix A)

label_comment_2
An interesting paper on an important new specimen, representing the first substantial 3D
preserved specimen of this enigmatic group.
a) can the authors comment on the ontogenetic age of this specimen? The small size,
disarticulation, and apparently weak ossification of some elements suggest this is not adult. How
would this affect some of the characters used in diagnosis, some of the cranial proportions,
absence of teeth?
3
b) This is not the first drepanosaur specimen to come from the Coelophysis Quarry. How would
the individual represented by the previously described shoulder girdle compare in size? Were
there other bones on the GR113 block?
c) Line 120 (p6) cites a manuscript that is only in submission, by Fabbri et al. This should be a
pers.comm, given that it is not yet peer-reviewed. Moreover, it is not listed in the reference list
nor is the lead author Fabbri mentioned in the Acknowledgements as having provided access to
the manuscript. The authors should provide evidence that Fabbri & co have given permission for
the manuscript to be mentioned. If one of the current authors is a co-author on that submitted
MS, they should say so and provide an explanation.
d) Could the apparently primitive characters of the ear be secondarily acquired? Chameleons
have odd (apparently primitive) ears, and the supposedly primitive ear of Sphenodon is also
secondary.
e) Did the authors designate an outgroup in their analysis? If so, what was it?
f) I appreciate that the authors have a focus on the PTE, but a comprehensive analysis would
surely include representatives of other eureptile groups like sauropterygians, choristoderes, and
turtles.

13 The Triassic Period saw the first appearance of numerous amniote lineages (e.g.,
4
5 14 Lepidosauria, Archosauria, Mammalia) that defined Mesozoic ecosystems following the
6 15 end Permian Mass Extinction, as well as the first major morphological diversification of
7 16 crown-group reptiles. Unfortunately, much of our understanding of this event comes from
8 17 the record of large-bodied reptiles (total body length > 1 meter). Here we present a new
9 18 species of drepanosaurid (small-bodied, chameleon-like diapsids) from the Upper Triassic
10
11
19 Chinle Formation of New Mexico. Using reconstructions of µCT data, we reveal the three-
12 20 dimensional skull osteology of this clade for the first time. The skull presents many archaic
13 21 anatomical traits unknown in Triassic crown-group reptiles (e.g., absence of bony support
14 22 for the external ear), whereas other traits (e.g., toothless rostrum, anteriorly directed
15 23 orbits, inflated endocranium) characterize derived avian theropods. A phylogenetic
16
24 analysis of Permo-Triassic diapsids supports the hypothesis that drepanosaurs are an
17
18 25 archaic Permian lineage, far removed from crown-group Reptilia. The phylogenetic
19 26 position of drepanosaurids indicate the presence of archaic Permian clades among Triassic
20 27 small reptile assemblages and that morphological convergence produced a remarkably
21 28 bird-like skull nearly one hundred million years before one emerged in Theropoda.

27 33 1. Background
28 34 The Triassic has long been recognized as a critical interval in the history of vertebrate
29
30
31 35 life, especially in terms of the taxonomic diversification of important Mesozoic taxa. It saw the
32
33 36 global recovery from the biodiversity crash of the Permo-Triassic Extinction (PTE), and the first
34
35 37 appearances of major terrestrial diapsid reptile clades that would typify Mesozoic ecosystems
36
37
38 38 (e.g., Dinosauromorpha, Lepidosauria, Pseudosuchia, Pterosauria, Sauropterygia) (1–7).
39
40 39 However, it has recently been recognized that the morphological diversification of
41
42
43
40 Diapsida in the Triassic was far broader than previously understood (8–11). A number of
44
45 41 bauplans long considered to be found only in later Mesozoic diapsids are now known in
46
47 42 unrelated Triassic lineages. These include bipedal toothless pseudosuchians closely resembling
48
49
50 43 Cretaceous ornithomimosaurs (12), dome-skulled forms similar to pachycephalosaurs (13),
51
52 44 pseudosuchian predators with high and narrow skulls similar to large neotheropods (14,15), and
53
54 45 a number of long-snouted semiaquatic lineages similar to later neosuchians (16–18). Thus, not
55
56
57 46 only were major taxonomic categories established during the Triassic Period, but suites of

2
3
47 morphological features—suites which would typify many Mesozoic and Cenozoic diapsid reptile
4
5
6 48 clades—emerged in a variety of unrelated Triassic species.
7
8 49 As yet, this pattern of convergent morphologies is well established in archosaurs and their
9
10
11
50 close relatives, a possible consequence of overall larger body size and higher preservational
12
13 51 potential (19,20). However, the Triassic Period fossil record rarely preserves small-bodied taxa
14
15 52 and critical details of their anatomy that illuminate both their phylogenetic relationships and
16
17
18 53 functional anatomy are lacking (21–23). Among the most diverse and speciose of these small-
19
20 54 bodied lineages are Drepanosauromorpha, a clade of superficially lizard-like species of which
21
22 55 have been favorably compared to chameleons and arboreal anteaters (Colbert and Olsen, 2001;
23
24
25 56 Pinna, 1986; Renesto, 1994; Renesto et al., 2010; Renesto and Binelli, 2006). Known
26
27 57 drepanosauromorph skulls and skeletons are almost all heavily compressed, completely
28
29
58 obscuring three-dimensional anatomy. The few three-dimensionally preserved specimens are
30
31
32 59 highly incomplete (29,30). Hypotheses for the affinities of drepanosauromorphs include
33
34 60 placement within Lepidosauromorpha (25,29,31), Archosauromorpha (27,32,33), and outside of
35
36
37 61 the crown reptile clade (34,35). These are reviewed in Appendix A.
38
39 62 Here, we report on a nearly complete and three-dimensionally preserved skull and partial
40
41 63 cervical series of a drepanosauromorph from the Upper Triassic (late Norian to Rhaetian)
42
43
44 64 Coelophysis Quarry (‘upper sandstone member,’ Chinle Formation). Using µCT scans and three-
45
46 65 dimensional modeling, we present a reconstruction of the skull of this new taxon (Fig. 1.,
47
48 66 Parameters for µCT scanning and reconstruction in Appendix B). The quality of preservation
49
50
51 67 allows us to re-assess the phylogenetic affinities of Drepanosauromorpha using a data matrix
52
53 68 focused on Permo-Triassic diapsids and early Sauria.

6 94 3. Comparative Anatomy
7
8 95 The identification of this specimen as a drepanosaurid is based on its cervical vertebral
9
10
11
96 anatomy. Drepanosaurids possess heterocoelous vertebrae with saddle-shaped articular surface.
12
13 97 The prezygapophyseal facets face anteriorly and extend far anteriorly relative to the anterior
14
15 98 margin of the centrum. The neural spines are anteroposteriorly short and strongly inclined
16
17
18 99 anterodorsally. In each of these features, Avicranium renestoi is very similar to drepanosaurids
19
20 100 with cervical series, specifically Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus (27,30).
21
22 101 a) Bird-like Traits
23
24
25 102 The skull of Avicranium renestoi exhibits a number of striking similarities to derived
26
27 103 avian theropods (Fig. 2). The rostrum is slender and acuminate, as has been noted in the Italian
28
29
104 drepanosaurid Megalancosaurus (38,39). A. renestoi combines this shape with a completely
30
31
32 105 edentulous rostrum and palate (Fig. 2e). The construction of the orbit differs from that in most
33
34 106 Triassic diapsids, in which the cavity is directed anterolaterally (32,40,41). In Drepanosaurus,
35
36
37 107 the frontal, postfrontal, and postorbital all contribute to a transversely broad postorbital septum,
38
39 108 which directs the orbits anteriorly (Fig. 2c). The analogous postorbital process in maniraptorans
40
41 109 integrates processes of the frontal, squamosal, and laterosphenoid (42). In most birds, the process
42
43
44 110 is formed primarily by a cartilaginous expansion of the laterosphenoid.
45
46 111 The endocranium preserves some of the most striking departures of the A. renestoi from
47
48 112 other Triassic reptiles. The contribution to the braincase of the paired frontal and parietal bones
49
50
51 113 is both broad transversely and tall dorsoventrally. This contribution is so prominent that the
52
53 114 contributing portion of the frontal is domed dorsally well above the orbital margin (Fig. 2a). A
54
55
56
115 similar shape otherwise only occurs in derived maniraptorans (43–46) and some pterosaurs

119 length of the frontal (48–50). An additional large lobe is formed by the posterior portion of the
12
13 120 parietal, likely the optic lobes (based on comparisons w/ modern Alligator and Gallus in Fabbri
14
15 121 et al., submitted). The anterior outlet of the osseous braincase in the A. renestoi is also
16
17
18 122 transversely broad; the prootics angle strongly medially at their anterior tips to meet
19
20 123 dorsolaterally inclined clinoid processes of the parabasisphenoid. A brain enlarged in the way
21
22 124 this endocast suggests is otherwise unknown in a Triassic reptile (Fig. 2a). Past studies correlate
23
24
25 125 the enlargement of the brain in pterosaurs and maniraptorans with the adaptation of those taxa to
26
27 126 flight—it may be that the enlargement of the drepanosaurid brain followed a similar path as an
28
29
127 adaptation to the three-dimensional environments required by arboreality and enhanced
30
31
32 128 stereoscopic vision (48,49,51).
33
34 129 b) Plesiomorphic Traits
35
36
37 130 The anatomy of the suspensorium and other traits of the braincase stand in stark contrast
38
39 131 to the ‘advanced’ features of the skull roof and rostrum. The squamosal is a dorsoventrally tall,
40
41 132 anteroposteriorly broad bone. It exhibits both lateral and posterior laminae that frame the
42
43
44 133 quadrate on those sides, as in archaic eureptiles [e.g., Captorhinus aguti (42,52)] and diapsids
45
46 134 [e.g., Araeoscelis gracilis (53)]. This contrasts with the condition in younginiform and saurian
47
48 135 reptiles (Appendix C), in which the quadrate is only framed laterally. In the latter taxa, the
49
50
51 136 quadrate also extends dorsally to fit into a fossa on the ventral surface of the squamosal—a
52
53 137 feature absent in Avicranium renestoi. The quadrate itself is dorsoventrally short and vertical,
54
55
56
138 lacking the posterior embayment in most early saurian reptiles (Fig. 2f) (32,54–56).

139 The braincase exhibits a number of traits more commonly found in non-saurian diapsids.
4
5
6 140 The occipital condyle exhibits a deep, posterior depression across much of its surface, and the
7
8 141 basal tubera barely extend ventrally below the condyle [Similar to Captorhinus aguti (57),
9
10
11
142 Araeoscelis gracilis (53)] (Fig. 2d). The foramen ovale is extremely large and extends to the
12
13 143 ventralmost margin of the braincase. The stapes is massive, with a footplate that entirely fills the
14
15 144 foramen and a lateral stem that is larger in all dimensions than the paroccipital process of the
16
17
18 145 opisthotic (Fig. 2d). Foramina ovale and stapedes of this great size are common in early amniotes
19
20 146 (57,58), but they are substantially smaller in younginiform diapsids [e.g., Youngina capensis
21
22 147 (59)] and early saurians [e.g., Mesosuchus browni (58), Prolacerta broomi (Gow, 1975)]. There
23
24
25 148 is no evidence of a laterosphenoid ossification, as in Archosauriformes (60–62).
26
27 149 The plesiomorphic diapsid characters of the skull in A. renestoi strongly suggest a very
28
29
150 primitive ear. Modern reptiles possess a tympanic membrane framed anteriorly by the concavity
30
31
32 151 of the quadrate, which medially contacts a cartilaginous extracollumella, which in turn meets a
33
34 152 very slender, osseous stapes (63,64). The absence of an embayed quadrate and tympanic crest in
35
36
37 153 A. renestoi suggest the absence of a tympanic membrane. The large foramen ovale with
38
39 154 prominent contributions by parabasisphenoid and basioccipital is more common in non-
40
41 155 younginiform and non-saurian diapsids, as is the large stapes (57,63,64). Thus A. renestoi lacks
42
43
44 156 the major osteological correlates of impedence-matched hearing. These features suggest the
45
46 157 absence of impedence-matched hearing. The archaic ear morphology in A. renestoi, in concert
47
48 158 with the other plesiomorphic amniote traits discussed above, contrasts sharply with the
49
50
51 159 comparatively “advanced” condition in most Triassic Sauria (56,58,65).

161 In light of the extensive new data on the cranial anatomy of Drepanosauromorpha
4
5
6 162 provided by AMNH FARB 30834, we integrated the taxon into a phylogenetic analysis focused
7
8 163 on Permo-Triassic Diapsida and early Sauria [modified from (10,11,66)]. We present analysis
9
10
11
164 parameters and detailed results in Appendix C. In the most-parsimonious trees,
12
13 165 Drepanosauromorpha is recovered as an extremely early-diverging clade of Diapsida, occurring
14
15 166 outside of a clade including Permian “younginiform” diapsids and Sauria (Fig. 3). The oldest-
16
17
18 167 known younginiform diapsid (Tropidostoma Zone Youngina) dates to the lowermost Upper
19
20 168 Permian (67), suggesting that drepanosauromorphs must have originated by the end of the
21
22 169 Middle Permian (~260 my).
23
24
25 170
26
27 171 5. Discussion & Conclusions
28
29
172 These results indicate that drepanosauromorphs represent a deep divergence within
30
31
32 173 Diapsida, earlier than that of crown reptiles, but one that persisted through the PTE and radiated
33
34 174 deep within the Triassic ((11,27). A number of the non-saurian diapsid taxa included in this
35
36
37 175 analysis are taxa that survived the PTE [Weigeltisauridae per (68), Hovasaurus boulei per (69)],
38
39 176 indicating that the survival of drepanosauromorphs was not a unique event.
40
41 177 Our revised phylogeny, combined with the extensive character data provided by the A.
42
43
44 178 renestoi holotype, strongly supports the hypothesis that Drepanosauromorpha are non-saurian
45
46 179 diapsids. Phylogenetic analyses have long recognized that a number of crown reptile lineages
47
48 180 (mostly early archosauromorphs) had diverged by the PTE, despite their appearance in the fossil
49
50
51 181 record in the Triassic Period (9,10,32,61). We tested hypothetical placements of
52
53 182 drepanosauromorphs among crown-group reptiles through constraint analyses, but found these to
54
55
56
183 be substantially less parsimonious (Appendix C). That result, along with the recognition of
57
58
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 9 of 41 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3
184 numerous other non-crown lineages within the Triassic indicates that the Triassic diapsid
4
5
6 185 radiation was far more phylogenetically heterogeneous than traditionally realized.
7
8 186 The general bird-like shape of the drepanosaurid rostrum has long been recognized,
9
10
11
187 owing to complete but crushed specimens from the Upper Triassic of Italy. The three-
12
13 188 dimensional preservation of AMNH FARB 30834 adds substantially to the bird-like features of
14
15 189 the skull, including the frontated orbits and presumed binocular vision, the absence of teeth,
16
17
18 190 possible fusion of the premaxillae, and the inflated endocranium. However, these features occur
19
20 191 in conjunction with a strikingly primitive braincase, suspensorium, and postcranial skeleton
21
22 192 (27)—features that strongly support the hypothesis that these bird-like features are entirely
23
24
25 193 convergent. Bird-like features have been noted in a number of small Triassic diapsids—including
26
27 194 Longisquama insignis and the putative stem-bird Protoavis texensis—which have been used to
28
29
195 support the hypothesis that key features of the bird skull evolved very early in the Mesozoic
30
31
32 196 (70,71). This conception of bird evolution stands at odds with the fossil record of Theropoda,
33
34 197 which suggests the gradual acquisition of avian cranial features throughout the Jurassic and
35
36
37 198 Cretaceous (72–74). The mosaic anatomy of Avicranium instead supports the hypothesis that
38
39 199 several advanced, bird-like traits first emerged in a Triassic diapsid lineage entirely outside of
40
41 200 crown reptiles (35).
42
43
44 201 The brain of A. renestoi differs greatly from that in most Permian and Triassic diapsids.
45
46 202 The cerebrum is substantially wider than the olfactory tracts and the endocranium occupies a
47
48 203 substantial proportion of the transverse width of the skull, distinctly similar to the brains of
49
50
51 204 maniraptorans (e.g.,(49,75,76), modern birds (e.g.,(77–79), and pterosaurs (e.g., (48,80). Many
52
53 205 authors have suggested that the proportional expansion of brain and cerebrum size in these taxa
54
55
56
206 is an adaptation to the sensory complexity required for navigating three-dimensional habitats

3
207 (81–83). The anteriorly directed orbits in Avicranium, coupled with the arboreal habitat for
4
5
6 208 drepanosauromorphs (27,38) suggest a complex sensory life for the animal and may explain the
7
8 209 similarities in brain shape to flying and arboreal taxa. Further testing of this hypothesis requires
9
10
11
210 better preserved endocasts and reconstruction of the vestibular apparatus of other
12
13 211 drepanosauromorphs.
14
15 212 This phylogenetic study, in concert with the advanced, bird-like characters of the skull of
16
17
18 213 A. renestoi, increases the known disparity achieved by terrestrial diapsid reptiles during the
19
20 214 Triassic Period and extends the pattern of morphological convergence on later Mesozoic lineages
21
22 215 during the Triassic beyond Archosauromorpha into a non-crown reptile group. This and similar
23
24
25 216 discoveries demand constant re-evaluation of the phylogenetic diversity and morphological
26
27 217 disparity of fossil groups involved in the recovery from the PTE.

Appendix B
REVISIONS
GENERAL –
MAIN-TEXT
• I have changed a number of small things in the manuscript with regards to diapsid taxonomy.
Previously, a number of in-text references to taxa referred only to the generic level. I have modified
these to refer to species-level taxa where appropriate.
• I have added a sentence in the phylogenetics section to emphasize the atypical position of
Kuehneosauridae in the phylogeny. This addition does not alter the narrative of the paper.
FIGURES
• Per Reviwer 1’s suggestion, I have added a vector graphics line drawing of the reconstructed skull of
Avicranium renestoi as a main-text figure (Figure 2).
• I have also added a photograph and interpretive diagram of the bones exposed on the Avicranium
renestoi holotype block (AMNH FARB 30834) to illustrate the elements that are exposed and those that
can only be seen in the CT slice data. This is now Figure 6.
• I toned down the colors for the indicator lines in Figure 1 & Figure 3, turning them from white to gray.
REVIEWER 1 (S. Renesto) –
“The finding of a three dimensionally preserved drepanosauromorph skull is unique and of great
scientific significance, the description is well written, consistent and complete, even if I would have liked
adding line drawing of the reconstructed skull.”
We concur with the reviewer’s thoughts on a line drawing. An additional figure with a line drawing of the
reconstructed skull in lateral view has been added to the main text.
“I have made some remarks in the text that should be addressed: reading the manuscript it seeems that
this is the first time that binocular vision and enlarged brain are proposed for drepanosauromorphs, but
indeed both were already suggested by Renesto and Dalla Vecchia (2005, see comments in the text for
details)”
We have re-emphasized the work by Renesto and Dalla Vecchia (2005) in the main text, noting their
initially developing these hypotheses for Drepanosauromorpha.
Page 2, Line 38 “for the sake of completeness Ichthyosaura should be added.”
Agreed and added.
Page 3, Line 55 “Colbert adn Olsen considered Hypuronector as aquatic”
Agreed. We have added a note about the aquatic hypothesis to the preceding statement.
Page 3, Line 56 “Pinna considered repanosaurus as a terrestrial scratch digger and Megalancosaurus as
aquatic”
I have rephrased the sentence to emphasize the range of opinions on the ecomorphology of individual
species of Drepanosauromorpha.
Page 3, Line 60 “I would add also reference 28”
Reference 28 includes valuable discussion of the phylogenetic positon of Drepanosauromorpha, so it has
now been included in this section.
Page 5, Line 106 “Do authors have really seen a Drepanosaurus skull? To my knowledge no
Drepanosaurus skull has ever been described. Thus a reference to the material is needed, If otherwise it
is a misnaming and they refer to Megalancosaurus they should quote the reference (39)”
The reference to a Drepanosaurus skull is an error. This statement should be in reference to the new
taxon, Avicranium renestoi. It has been corrected.
Page 6, Line 116 “And is also reported for Megalancosaurus specimen MPUM 8437 (Renesto and Dalla
Vecchia, ref. 39)”
Rather than add Megalancosaurus to the list, I have slightly rewritten this section to emphasize that
Megalancosaurus was the first drepanosaur for which a domed skull roof was suggested.
Page 6, Line 124 “Specimen MPUM 8437 (described in Renesto and Dalla Vecchia 2005, ref 39 in the
manuscript?) In my opinion shares with the new taxon an inflated skull and possible large brain.”
The original sentence emphasized the uniqueness of the reconstructed endocast in Avicranium renestoi.
I have rewritten it to indicate that a similar anatomy may have been present in Megalancosaurus prior to
the crushing and distortion of the specimen.
Page 6, Line 127 “Possibly also prey manipulation : Castiello M Renesto S, Bennett CS
(2016) the role of the forelimb in prey capture in the Late Triassic reptile Megalancosaurus (Diapsida,
Drepanosauromorpha) Historical Biology 28(8):1090-1100.”
I concur with the reviewer’s comment on the possibility that precision manipulation could be connected
to the enlargment of the brain. I have added a comment and the reference.
Page 6, Line 128 “add ref. 39 where the same interpretaton is proposed.”
I did not realize that stereoscopic vision had been proposed for Megalancosaurus. I have added a
comment to that effect.
Page 6, Line 128 “Is there any clue about craniocervical articulation, ventrally placed in a pterodactyloid
-like fashion as inMegalancoasurus or posteriorly placed as in most reptiles?”
The inclination of the craniocervical articulation is difficult to assess, due to the state of disarticulation of
the original specimen. I have added a comment that our reconstructed braincase suggests a posterior
inclination relative to the long axis of the skull, although the distortion means that this interpretation is
tentative.
Page 10, Line 141 “My only concern is that (with the exception of 27 and 28) in all phylogenies
concerning drepanosaurs there are almost all dipasid groups, included theropod dinosaurs but never
basal pterosaurs.”
I have added a note regarding the hypothesis that drepanosauromorphs and pterosaurs may be related
to the appendix in reference to the ideas presented in references 27 and 28. However, I disagree that
the absence of basal pterosaurs is problematic. Most of the phylogenetic characters in this analysis
would be coded the same for both a basal dinosaur (e.g., Coelophysis bauri) and a basal pterosaur (e.g.,
Dimorphodon macronyx), and a derived archosaurian phylogenetic position for Pterosauria has been
widely recovered in recent large-scale studies of Archosauromorpha (e.g., Nesbitt, 2011; Ezcurra,
2016).
REVIEWER 2 –
“[C]an the authors comment on the ontogenetic age of this specimen? The small size, disarticulation,
and apparently weak ossification of some elements suggest this is not adult. How would this affect some
of the characters used in diagnosis, some of the cranial proportions, absence of teeth?”
We have added a comment on the ontogenetic state of the CQ drepanosaur specimen. In terms of the
anteroposterior length of the skull, it is not very different from the type specimen of Megalancosaurus
preonensis (MFSN 1769), so the size is not markedly different from other drepanosauromorphs. “Weak”
ossification is also common for known drepanosauromorph specimens; the bones in the known skulls of
Megalancosaurus preonensis and Vallesaurus cenensis are not strongly co-ossified, with the few
apparent sutures being open. In light of the similar size and degree of ossification of the Avicranium
renestoi holotype (AMNH FARB 30834) to other known drepanosauromorph skulls, we do not think the
absence of teeth is a consequence of a relatively early ontogenetic state.
“This is not the first drepanosaur specimen to come from the Coelophysis Quarry. How would the
individual represented by the previously described shoulder girdle compare in size? Were there other
bones on the GR113 block?”
I have taken some measurements of the Coelophysis Quarry pectoral girdle (GR 113) and the skull
described in this paper (AMNH FARB 30834) and made comparisons to the relative size of the skull and
pectoral girdle in the holotypes of Megalancosaurus preonensis (MFSN 1769) and Vallesaurus cenensis
(MCSNB 4751). The proportions from the more complete Italian specimens suggest that the pectoral
girdle and skull came from drepanosauormorphs of similar size.
The GR 113 block also preserves a small ulna, which was initially referred to Coelophysis bauri by Harris
and Downs (2002). However, Pritchard et al. (2016) re-assessed the specimen and argue that the ulna
also belongs to a drepanosauromorph. No other bones are apparent on the block.
“ Line 120 (p6) cites a manuscript that is only in submission, by Fabbri et al. This should be a
pers.comm, given that it is not yet peerreviewed. Moreover, it is not listed in the reference list nor is the
lead author Fabbri mentioned in the Acknowledgements as having provided access to the manuscript.
The authors should provide evidence that Fabbri & co have given permission for the manuscript to be
mentioned. If one of the current authors is a coauthor on that submitted MS, they should say so and
provide an explanation.
”
The status of the Fabbri et al. manuscript, on which A. C. Pritchard is the third author, has changed
since the initial submission of this manuscript. The Fabbri manuscript has now been completely reviewed
and is current in press at Nature Ecology & Evolution. I have added Matteo Fabbri, the study’s lead
author, to the acknowledgments for helpful discussions on the relationship between the skull roofing
bones and the underlying structure of the brain.
“Could the apparently primitive characters of the ear be secondarily acquired? Chameleons have odd
(apparently primitive) ears, and the supposedly primitive ear of Sphenodon is also secondary.
”
We have made a comment on the apparently plesiomorphic ears of modern chameleons and Sphenodon.
However, in both of these examples, the absence of an external ear is accompanied by a gracile stapes,
a condyle-cotyle articulation between the quadrate and squamosal, and a narrow lateral exposure of the
squamosal—all characters present in . Avicranium renestoi differs from both of these taxa in that the
shape and structure of the all the bones of the suspensorium and the stapes more closely resemble early
amniotes than they do contemporaneous crown-group reptiles.
“Did the authors designate an outgroup in their analysis? If so, what was it?
”
As in most prior analyses of Permo-Triassic Diapsida and early crown-group reptiles (1–3), we
designated the Carboniferous diapsid Petrolacosaurus kansensis as our outgroup.
“I appreciate that the authors have a focus on the PTE, but a comprehensive analysis would surely
include representatives of other eureptile groups like sauropterygians, choristoderes, and turtles.”
We have modified our in-text discussion of the phylogenetic analysis to note the analysis as
comprehensive in reference to terrestrial representatives of Permo-Triassic Diapsida. However, the only
potential implication that the inclusion of these other taxa would be to increase the degree of diapsid
diversification immediately before and after the PTE.
