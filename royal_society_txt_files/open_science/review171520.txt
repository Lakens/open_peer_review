Review
Overall the paper describes a well-performed study. Even though I am not confident in some of
the statistical methods use (random forest) the overall setup appears sound and most of the work
done is clearly described (I have noted some exceptions below).
I think the paper is a well written and with some very minor adjustments it should be suitable for
publication. Nevertheless I have some things that I think should be seen to in order to make it
even more clear and readable. Foremost, since the analysis is focused on the - rated and modelled
- interaction of the performers, the authors could put a bit more effort in describing the situation
where the interaction actually took place. That is, the video recordings. How were the players
and cameras placed? What where the instructions in terms of clothing and positions
(seated/standing) etc? Some of this could influence what data that was collected from both video
annotation and motion extraction. Specifically, I am thinking that the performers may have been
facing each other, while the camera (and thus the annotators’) view was orthogonal. This means
that the interaction took place in a different plane than what was observable. With expert
annotators this might not have been a problem at all, but I think a line or two discussing this
would be in place. In particular, since the online material does not show the videos either but
point-light displays from the same recordings.
I think the conclusions are supported by the data and paper advances the knowledge on musical
interaction and how to quantify it. The modelling of the interaction is based on the manual
annotation of experts and then validated again with novice raters in Experiment 2. As is
discussed in the sections on limitations and future directions, there are some cons to using
annotations and subjective data and perhaps the very strong predictor of overall (broad band)
energy is one symptom of this. When both performers are moving much they generate more
movement amplitude and this is coded as interaction - but what would the performers
themselves say? Here self-reports and interviews would really have supported the annotators’
coding. The kinds of movements that generated the energy are not discussed much (except on the
last page) which is a bit of a pity.
I appreciate that the authors discuss these and other possible limitations with the study
“limitations” section (such as different movement patterns related to visibility; studying the beat-
level of the synchronisation; and the use of cross-recurrence quantification) and I think follow-up
studies employing more of this would be really exciting.
The statistical analysis overall appears sound and is, generally, well described. However, there
are many smaller tests that are “implied” by the statistics rather than spelled out. I think that the
kind of test themselves should be stated for clarity (e.g. Page 7, line 11; Page 11, line 15; Page 20,
line 6)
Not looking at inter-performer movements, but perhaps still relevant enough to take a look at are
Teixeira et al (2015) approach to extract recurrent gestures from ancillary movements and Visi et
al (2014) periodic quantity of motion.

Section 2, Experiment 1, Methods, Materials:
It is not clearly stated whether any of the performing duos were “overlapping” in terms of
performers. Had the musicians played together before?
The description of the video recordings could be more clear. Specifically, the position of the
performers in relation to each other, and also the positions of the cameras in relation to the
performers could be better described. What were the instructions to the performers in terms of
orientation to one another? Did the position of the cameras in any way align with the view the
performers had of one another?
Page 8, first paragraph:
Frame differencing (and some other operations) in image processing depend on that there is
some contrast/change with respect to the earlier frame for motion to be detected. What was the
players’ wearing when performing and did this contrast sufficiently with the background? In
figure 1, for instance, the upper player appears to be wearing dark shirt against a dark
background while the lower player is wearing white against a mostly white background. It
would be good to have an estimate of how much this could influence the extraction of movement
data.

not very clear. Perhaps a clarifying sentence or two would make it easier to follow.

solo does not put particular emphasis on coordinating performances via visual interactions near
section boundaries”
Judging from Figure 3, I think it looks like the pulsed duos do not interact particularly during
solos when close to section boundaries, but overall there appears to be more bouts? Or am I
misinterpreting the figure here?

The paper presents the results of a study in which annotated visual observations of music
interaction are predicted by audiovisual energetic measures of the performers.
5
The paper is well-written and provides an interesting contribution to the current state of the art in
music performance analysis.
The paper could be improved by having a better description and motivation of the annotation
task which resulted in the visually observed co-performer interaction cues. Why not using audio,
for example?
As to the global analysis presented on p. 9-12, I don’t really see why it is included it because the
analysis is based on extracted features, rather than on raw movements and audio presented. This
type of analysis is probably useful, but it is not always necessary to report it is detail. I agree that
the overall outcome may be of interest.
I also wondered why a simple correlation analysis of the obtained features, such as a PCA, for
example was not used. That would have revealed their usefulness for further model building
right from the beginning.
Finally, my major point, perhaps, is that the paper doesn’t test a theory. Basically it tests a
method (whether visual bouts of interaction as coded manually can be predicted). I would
suggest to pick up the research question stated on page 4 and structure the discussion
accordingly, and then say how it relates to recent theories of interaction.
Some further remarks:
p.7: it would be better to mention the sampling rate of the movement analysis in (iii)
p.7: “CWT analysis is an extension of the WT in which the WT of …..” Should it not be: “…in
which the CWT of…..”?
p.7-8: The issue about phase information (p.8) could be deleted because it is not used in the
analysis.
p. 10 (i). This section should be clarified. It is not clear what you mean by musical structure. How
do you define “music structural sections”? Since I don’t understand what a structural section is, I
don’t understand the figure. It is probably something very simple.
(ii) you use the wavelet transform to
p. 11: It is not clear what you want to say here (Figure 5), especially when you don’t care about
tempo.
p. 13, line 7: “upper body movements typical occur around the 0.5 Hz region”. Well, I don’t see
that in Figure 5.
Line 9: “We assume this relates to…” Why assuming ?. It can be easily figured out whether this
hypothesis is true or not. Related to that it would be necessary to have a list of the tempi of all the
performances.
p. 14, l.34: “normalised for the analyses”. How?
p. 20: I would have preferred to see the the numbers or percentages on which Table 4 is based.
p. 23, l13: Be careful about the term “co-performer interactions” and repeat that these are the
visually observed co-performer interaction cues. In this sentence and the sentences that follow,
you should avoid the suggestion that you speak about the “true” interactions because that’s not
what your correlation analysis does.

etc? Some of this could influence what data that was collected from
both video annotation and motion extraction. Specifically, I am
thinking that the performers may have been facing each other, while
the camera (and thus the annotators’) view was orthogonal. This
means that the interaction took place in a different plane than what
was observable. With expert annotators this might not have been a
problem at all, but I think a line or two discussing this would be
in place. In particular, since the online material does not show the
videos either but point-light displays from the same recordings.
R: Thanks for the helpful suggestions for improvements. We have now
expanded the description of the performance set-up (some of these
details are also available in Moran et al. 2015), in terms of the
performer’s and camera’s positions, and have clarified that the
actual video recordings are available at:
http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2840
It is true that the annotators’ line of sight differed to that of
the performers, which may have an influence on what cues can be
annotated. This most likely downplays the importance of direct gaze
cues, which may be difficult to judge from a different plane. We now
discuss this and the related caveats in the General Discussion
section.
I think the conclusions are supported by the data and paper advances
the knowledge on musical interaction and how to quantify it. The
modelling of the interaction is based on the manual annotation of
experts and then validated again with novice raters in Experiment 2.
As is discussed in the sections on limitations and future
directions, there are some cons to using annotations and subjective
data and perhaps the very strong predictor of overall (broad band)
energy is one symptom of this. When both performers are moving much
they generate more movement amplitude and this is coded as
interaction - but what would the performers themselves say? Here
self-reports and interviews would really have supported the
annotators’ coding. The kinds of movements that generated the energy
are not discussed much (except on the last page) which is a bit of a
pity.
R: Interviews with the musicians could potentially be useful (as
already mentioned in the General Discussion), although the
performers might not consciously access all the cues for interaction
(e.g., Pras, Schober, & Spiro, 2017) since in many cases they must
rely on seeing peripheral movement. The point the reviewer makes
about higher movement amplitude leading to more interactions is not
actually supported by our results, since the raw amplitude of the
movement (Quantity of Motion) was not an important predictor of
bouts of interaction in either pulsed or non-pulsed duos in
Experiment 1 (see Figure 7 in the revision), nor was it a
significant predictor in Experiment 2 (where it was specifically
controlled). The reviewer puts forward good suggestions for follow-
up studies, and in line with incremental research process, once we
have identified that certain components could be related to
interactions in this study, it would be prudent to pinpoint the
features more causally, which would mean manipulation of such
features (e.g. mask parts of the visual information, for instance,
see Kawase, 2014; or carry out detailed kinematic feature analysis,
see Bishop & Goebl, in press). We have added these ideas to the
General Discussion section.
I appreciate that the authors discuss these and other possible
limitations with the study “limitations” section (such as different
movement patterns related to visibility; studying the beat-level of
the synchronisation; and the use of cross-recurrence quantification)
and I think follow-up studies employing more of this would be really
exciting.
The statistical analysis overall appears sound and is, generally,
well described. However, there are many smaller tests that are
“implied” by the statistics rather than spelled out. I think that
the kind of test themselves should be stated for clarity (e.g. Page
7, line 11; Page 11, line 15; Page 20, line 6)
R: Thanks, the details of these tests have now been added.
Not looking at inter-performer movements, but perhaps still relevant
enough to take a look at are Teixeira et al (2015) approach to
extract recurrent gestures from ancillary movements and Visi et al
(2014) periodic quantity of motion.
R: Thanks for the great recommendations. These have now been
integrated into the Introduction to further motivate the focus on
analyzing particular frequencies of movement and tracking of
ancillary movements.
Page 1, Line 14: Reference Street 1984 not in list of references
R: Apologies, this is now added.
Section 2, Experiment 1, Methods, Materials:
It is not clearly stated whether any of the performing duos were
“overlapping” in terms of performers. Had the musicians played
together before?
R: None of the duos overlapped in terms of performers. Some of the
musicians had played together before, but this was not the main
recruitment criterion. This information has been added to the
manuscript.
The description of the video recordings could be more clear.
Specifically, the position of the performers in relation to each
other, and also the positions of the cameras in relation to the
performers could be better described. What were the instructions to
the performers in terms of orientation to one another? Did the
position of the cameras in any way align with the view the
performers had of one another?
R: Thanks, we have now provided a more thorough description of the
orientation of the performers and camera.
Page 8, first paragraph:
Frame differencing (and some other operations) in image processing
depend on that there is some contrast/change with respect to the
earlier frame for motion to be detected. What was the players’
wearing when performing and did this contrast sufficiently with the
background? In figure 2 (revised manuscript), for instance, the
upper player appears to be wearing dark shirt against a dark
background while the lower player is wearing white against a mostly
white background. It would be good to have an estimate of how much
this could influence the extraction of movement data.
R: This is not a problem for extraction of the movement data. In
fact, we explored these technical concerns in a separate study
(Jakubowski et al., 2017, Frontiers in Digital Humanities), which
actually used several of the same videos with excellent success.
When a dark shirt is moving against dark background, the extraction
focusses on the edges of the movement, which are visible after the
dynamic threshold done in the process. In Exp. 2 we utilized the
frame differencing operation to estimate the amount of movement to
control the stimulus selection. Even if challenges creating by low
contrasts between the musician and background might have an impact
on the amount of change, it would have a minor impact to the results
since it only concerns 1 or 2 duos. But we are fairly confident that
the video-based optical tracking is robust for these videos since we
have optimized the technique in a separate study which compared the
results of the optical tracking to the results obtained from motion
capture with nearly perfect match (r=0.92 between optical and motion
capture data for tracking the head of performers in these jazz
duos).We have now added more detail about the technical validation
study (Jakubowski et al., 2017) in the ‘Movement extraction’ section
of the Method.
Page 11, Section “Characterisation of performers’ behaviours”, first
paragraph: this paragraph is not very clear. Perhaps a clarifying
sentence or two would make it easier to follow.
R: Thanks, we have revised the start of this paragraph to make our
aims here clearer.
Figure 3: Please state clearly where these “bouts” come from. As
annotated from the video?
R: Yes, the bouts come from annotations of the video. We have now
clarified the terminology and the text caption to be more explicit.
Page 11, second paragraph, lines 42-44: “It seems in this case that
this so-called “trading solos”, where performers alternate between
playing together and each taking their turn in performing a solo
does not put particular emphasis on coordinating performances via
visual interactions near section boundaries”
Judging from Figure 3, I think it looks like the pulsed duos do not
interact particularly during solos when close to section boundaries,
but overall there appears to be more bouts? Or am I misinterpreting
the figure here?
R: We have now described the motivation for this figure (figure 4
now) more clearly in the preceding paragraph (‘Describing annotated
bouts of interaction’) to aid interpretation. The review’s
interpretation is quite similar to the one we made (that pulsed duos
do not show more interaction close to section boundaries than in
other parts of the solos). It is true that there are more bouts of
interaction marked in the solo sections for the pulsed than non-
pulsed duos, although it should also be noted that the annotated
bouts of interaction in the pulsed solos are generally quite a bit
shorter in duration (median = 7.7 s) than bouts in the non-pulsed
solos (median = 26.2 s); this information is already given in Table
1. We have also provided a more thorough interpretation of these
results in the manuscript.
Figure 4: Is the assumed 120 BPM and 4/4 related to Autumn leaves
or?
R: This Figure is intended to show a generic framework that outlines
the relationships between musical units, frequency, period, movement
types and hierarchy of beats, and was not constructed to
specifically represent the tempo of Autumn Leaves (since every duo
performs Autumn Leaves at a slightly different tempo, although the
mean tempo of 132.1 BPM and tempo range of 120-150 BPM for Autumn
Leaves are quite close to this). Since this is a generic framework
rather than a ‘result’ of our work we have now moved this figure to
the Introduction of the paper for clarity (it is Figure 1 now).
Figure 5: Please clearly state what the shading around the curves is
denoting. CI?
R: These are labelled on the Y-axis of the Figure (“Amplitude ± SD”)
and refer to standard deviations, but we’ve also added this to the
figure caption for clarity.
Page 13, lines 43-46:
“the analysis thus far has described the range of movement
frequencies and their mutual relationships, as well as the
periodicities of the music (audio) itself” I don’t think you have
presented the results of any audio analysis so far?
R: We described the audio periodicities in the performances in the
previous section (p. 12, lower panel of Figure 5), but we have now
clarified this section further.
Page 14, first paragraph, lines 11-13: Confusing use of units
‘seconds’ and ‘Hz’. You first mention frequency bands but state
seconds. Are you switching between IOI and frequency? Be consistent!
R: Apologies, as creating confusion was not the intention here, but
explaining the frequency bands using both units was intentional. We
wanted to be explicit in the way the frequency bands were defined
and therefore give both units of measurements. If we only would have
given the centre frequencies, the overlap of the bands might have
been unclear. The second reason for once mentioning both units was
to provide a clearer integration with some of the existing
literature that uses seconds. We have now relegated the period
durations (in seconds) to a footnote and refer only to frequency
(Hz) in the main text to improve clarity.
Page 15, second paragraph: Please briefly describe what Figure 7 is
showing before jumping to the interpretations.
R: Thanks, useful reminder, we have now done this at the beginning
of the paragraph.
Page 16, second paragraph, line 49: “and 95% confidence intervals”
Here I think you can add that these are shown in parenthesis in the
table.
R: Thanks, now added.
Page 17, section “Contribution of the predictors2, line 46:
Figure is missing number
R: Thanks, now added.
Page 20, section Participants: how and where were the participants
recruited?
R: Participants were an opportunity sample recruited via social
media. This information has now been added to the manuscript.

reference could be Vines et al (2006)?
R: Thanks, this reference has been added.

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper presents the results of a study in which annotated visual
observations of music interaction are predicted by audiovisual
energetic measures of the performers.
The paper is well-written and provides an interesting contribution
to the current state of the art in music performance analysis.
The paper could be improved by having a better description and
motivation of the annotation task which resulted in the visually
observed co-performer interaction cues. Why not using audio, for
example?
R: The primary emphasis of the study was on visual cues for
interaction (as stated in our research questions). As such, we feel
the decision to carry out annotation using only visual information
(no sound) was justified by the fact that if the annotators had
watched the videos with access to the auditory information, this
could have introduced a variety of confounds related to the presence
of multimodal cues (e.g. it could be quite difficult for the
annotators to ignore auditory coordination cues when trying to
assess visual coordination cues).We have also attempted to improve
the description of the annotation task by giving example codes from
individual annotators to demonstrate the types of cues and level of
detail that were utilized in this task.
As to the global analysis presented on p. 9-12, I don’t really see
why it is included it because the analysis is based on extracted
features, rather than on raw movements and audio presented. This
type of analysis is probably useful, but it is not always necessary
to report it is detail. I agree that the overall outcome may be of
interest.
R: We have decided to include this descriptive account of the data
before testing the predictive power of the extracted features
because we believe it provides a fuller and more illuminating
account of the data, particularly considering this type of analysis
has not been frequently applied in the domain of music research and
may be unfamiliar to the reader.
I also wondered why a simple correlation analysis of the obtained
features, such as a PCA, for example was not used. That would have
revealed their usefulness for further model building right from the
beginning.
R: On page 3 we refer to a critique made to correlational analyses
of time-series data. Secondly, we are not dealing with linear
prediction, as the predictions in Exp. 1 concern categories (binary
dependent variable). Thirdly, the features extracted are not
normally distributed, which is problematic for the PCA. If we have
had more features in general, then, for an explorative analysis, we
could have resorted to PCA to reduce the feature space (while
violating normality), but our feature space was not really a problem
with 12 features and 22,050 observations.
Finally, my major point, perhaps, is that the paper doesn’t test a
theory. Basically it tests a method (whether visual bouts of
interaction as coded manually can be predicted). I would suggest to
pick up the research question stated on page 4 and structure the
discussion accordingly, and then say how it relates to recent
theories of interaction.
R: We agree that creating a method for discovering the interactions
was a central aim of the study, but we do take the theories
concerning interaction, coordination and synchronization forward and
apply them to our case. For instance, we refer to several relevant
theories in the introduction (Richardson et al., 2007, Shockley et
al., 2003, Vesper et al., 2010, Keller et al, 2014) and revisit some
of these in the conclusions. For instance, the theories coming from
conversation analysis do describe the process by which the
individuals align that are consistent with the approach we take,
namely that alignment is dynamic and multi-level (Pickering &
Garrod, 2004; Dale, Fusaroli, Duran & Richardson, 2013), or could be
seen as dynamic coupling (Dumas, Laroche, & Lehmann, 2014), or as
exchange of information (Gallotti et al., 2016). However, none of
these theories provide directly testable hypothesis of the types of
behaviours that we are focusing our attention to, but now we link
the findings and the existing theories in an explicit way at the
conclusions.
Some further remarks:
p.7: it would be better to mention the sampling rate of the movement
analysis in (iii)
R: Thanks, now added.
p.7: “CWT analysis is an extension of the WT in which the WT of …..”
Should it not be: “…in which the CWT of…..”?
R: Apologies, this was indeed a typo that has been corrected.
p.7-8: The issue about phase information (p.8) could be deleted
because it is not used in the analysis.
R: This is not true- the phase information was indeed used in the
initial analysis stage, but was not found to be substantially
related to the annotated bouts of interaction (see Figure 7 for
instance), whereas the later analyses utilized only the most
relevant features and thus excluded phase (e.g. Table 3, Figure 8).
p. 10 (i). This section should be clarified. It is not clear what
you mean by musical structure. How do you define “music structural
sections”? Since I don’t understand what a structural section is, I
don’t understand the figure. It is probably something very simple.
R: We have now revised the start of this paragraph to make it
clearer what we mean by ‘musical structure’; these were simply the
annotations done by one annotator of whether the performers were
both playing together (joint sections) or taking solos (solo
sections).
p. 11: It is not clear what you want to say here (Figure 5),
especially when you don’t care about tempo.
R: Point taken, but we do care about the periodicities present in
the audio (which are used as a predictor in the subsequent analyses,
Table 2, predictor 11) and the point of this summary was to give the
reader an overview of what kind of periodicities are present both in
the movement and audio data. The peaks are quite clear and we
believe the differences in frequencies between movements and audio
are also worth of noting. With respect to tempo, we do care about
the periodicities in the audio, if not the actual perceptual tempo,
since tempo is not the physical description of the signal but
perceptual interpretation.
p. 13, line 7: “upper body movements typical occur around the 0.5 Hz
region”. Well, I don’t see that in Figure 5.
R: We said “are in line with previous research…” and we refer to
pulsed duos where the second highest peak is at the 0.5 Hz. As this
was a fairly loose interpretation, since the tempo of the music
probably determines a large extent of the exact frequencies, we have
now eliminated the offending sentence.
Line 9: “We assume this relates to…” Why assuming ?. It can be
easily figured out whether this hypothesis is true or not. Related
to that it would be necessary to have a list of the tempi of all the
performances.
R: Sure, since we already report the tempi of both the pulsed and
non-pulsed duos in Table 1, we now explicitly refer to these tempo
estimations (132 vs 106 BPM).
p. 14, l.34: “normalised for the analyses”. How?
R: This was done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the
standard deviation (converting to z-scores); we have now changed the
wording to “converted into z-scores for the analyses”.
p. 20: I would have preferred to see the the numbers or percentages
on which Table 4 is based.
R: The numbers that most precisely describe these results (means and
SDs) are already in the table. This was, unlike Exp. 1, not a
classification task, but consisted of ratings on a scale of 1-7
(thus the dependent variable is treated as continuous rather than
categorical).
p. 23, l13: Be careful about the term “co-performer interactions”
and repeat that these are the visually observed co-performer
interaction cues. In this sentence and the sentences that follow,
you should avoid the suggestion that you speak about the “true”
interactions because that’s not what your correlation analysis does.
R: Thanks for the reminder, we have now added the caveats about
these in several pertinent places.
Additionally, we spotted a number of small inconsistencies in
formatting which we have fixed. We redid the figure 6 to clarify the
correspondences between simultaneous frequencies exhibited by the
two performers by reanalyzing the data with a more coarse binning of
the frequencies. This had the positive result of showing the overall
pattern in a clearer way than the original figure, which mainly
highlight few (rare) peaks.
