Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors reported a type of dielectric elastomer actuator, which is using carbon
nanotube/polyvinyl alcohol (CNT/PVA) hydrogel as the stretchable electrodes. The CNT/PVA
hydrogel electrodes demonstrate a stretchability up to 200% with a small relative resistance
change of ~1.2, and a self-healing capability. Even though the actuated deformation strain is not
so high, the healable electrode is quite interesting. I think this paper can fit the publication level
of R. Soc. open sci. I only have few minor suggestions.
1) The electrode in figure 1e seems to be not flat. It is better to show the photos of some optimized
sample with clear and flat electrode.
2) VHB 4910 is a rather thick tape and you can use some thinner ones (4905 or 9473) to realize
high expansion strain.
3) Usually self-healing capability of DEA is related to the electrical breakdown effect, not just the
cutting behavior. It is better you can discuss something about the healing behavior after electrical
breakdown.
4) In figure 2c and 2d, the author discussed about resistance changing. It is better to show the
conductivity changing rather than resistance. Then, you may find that the conductivity is almost
unchanged with different strain, which would be more persuasive.
5) Recently, people can produce high voltage to drive DEA by using self-powered technique
[Adv. Funct. Mater. 26, (2016) 4906-4913; Nano Energy 38 (2017) 91–100; Adv. Funct. Mater.

The authors reported carbon nanotube and polyvinyl alcohol-based dielectric elastomer actuator
that has 40% more areal strain and is 200% stretchable. The new structure also showed self-
healing capability due to hydrogen bonding and lower relative resistance than the other
stretchable conductors. I believe the authors have presented interesting work and have addressed
the previous reviewers’ questions. Therefore, I would recommend the manuscript for publication
after a minor revision.
1. It is not elevated that why the authors have chosen specific percentages for the chemical mixes
while preparing the CNT-PVA hydrogel. i.e., 0.32 g PVA, 50g CNT, 2 hrs ultrasonication. How
did they decide these numbers and times? What happens otherwise?
2. It is stated that the hydrogel could repeat its performance up to 1800 cycles without any
degradation. Did the authors repeat this lifetime test to the sample they cut after the self-healing
process? Are there any different results observed?

Reviewer #1
Comments:
The authors reported a type of dielectric elastomer actuator, which is using carbon
nanotube/polyvinyl alcohol (CNT/PVA) hydrogel as the stretchable electrodes. The
CNT/PVA hydrogel electrodes demonstrate a stretchability up to 200% with a small
relative resistance change of ~1.2, and a self-healing capability. Even though the
actuated deformation strain is not so high, the healable electrode is quite interesting. I
think this paper can fit the publication level of R. Soc. open sci. I only have few minor
suggestions.
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the precious comments on our work.
Comment #1. The electrode in figure 1e seems to be not flat. It is better to show the
photos of some optimized sample with clear and flat electrode.
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work. According to
the suggestion from the Reviewer, we replace Figure 1e with a higher resolution to show
the electrode.
Our modification to the manuscript:
(1) In the revised manuscript, Figure 1e is replaced by a higher resolution image, as
shown in Figure R1.
Figure R1. A photograph of CNT/PVA hydrogel on DEA.
Comment #2. VHB 4910 is a rather thick tape and you can use some thinner ones (4905
or 9473) to realize high expansion strain.
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work.
(1) Expansion tests of DEAs based on VHB 4910 and VHB 4905 were conducted
according to the suggestion from the Reviewer, as shown in Figure R2. The areal
strain of the DEA based on VHB 4905, as shown in Figure R2a, is higher than that of
the DEA based on VHB 4910, while the former breakdown voltage is 1.8 kV. The
lower breakdown voltage of DEA based on VHB 4905 can be contributed to its
relative smaller thickness.
(2) Furthermore, the DEA based on VHB 4905 was still tested likewise under 1.5 kV
alternating current voltage with different frequency, as shown in Figure R2b. The
DEA based on VHB 4905 has 2 times larger areal strain than that of the device based
on VHB 4910.
Figure R2. (a) Areal strains of the DEAs based on CNT/PVA hydrogel electrodes with
VHB 4905 and 4910, and PVA hydrogel electrodes with VHB 4910 as a function of
applied voltage, respectively. (b) Areal strains of the DEAs based on CNT/PVA hydrogel
electrodes with VHB 4905 and 4910, and PVA hydrogel electrodes with VHB 4910 as a
function of applied frequency under AC 1.5 kV, respectively.
Our modification to the manuscript:
(1) In the revised manuscript, Figure 4c and 4d and their figure captions are replaced.
(2) In the revised manuscript, on page 7, line 13, “Areal strain of the DEA based on
VHB 4905 (blue curve in Figure 4c) is higher than that based on VHB 4910 (black
curve in Figure 4c), while the former breaks down at 1.8 kV. The lower breakdown
voltage of the DEA based on VHB 4905 can be contributed to lower thickness during
expansion.” is added.
(3) In the revised manuscript, on page 7, line 21, “The DEA based on CNT/PVA
hydrogel with VHB 4905 (blue curve in Figure 4d) has 2 times larger areal strain
than that of the device based on VHB 4910 (blue curve in Figure 4d).” is added.
Comment #3. Usually self-healing capability of DEA is related to the electrical
breakdown effect, not just the cutting behavior. It is better you can discuss something
about the healing behavior after electrical breakdown.
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work.
(1) While some groups have previously referred to electrical breakdown effect of DEAs
in their works [J. Polym. Sci. Pol. Phys., 2011, 49, 504-515; Int. J. Solids. Struct.,
2006, 43, 7727-7751.; Smart Mater. Struct. 2013, 22, 104012; Appl. Phys. Lett., 2016,
108, 012903; J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133, 43258], however, further investigations
on self-healing capability after breakdown have not been found. We has tried to
investigate the possible self-healing of the DEA after its breakdown, but the device
cannot recover.
(2) In this study, the self-healing property of CNT/PVA hydrogel is the main concern
rather than the whole DEA. It is believed that we have demonstrated comprehensively
and discussed fully on self-healing property of CNT/PAV hydrogel after systematic
research in this paper. Therefore, none modification are suggested to do.
Our modification to the manuscript: None.
Comment #4. In figure 2c and 2d, the author discussed about resistance changing. It is
better to show the conductivity changing rather than resistance. Then, you may find that
the conductivity is almost unchanged with different strain, which would be more
persuasive.
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work.
(1) We agree with the Reviewer that it is better to show the conductivity change rather
than resistance. We planned to get the conductivity from sheet resistance of the
hydrogel according to the following equation:
1
<U+F073><U+F03D> (1)
Rs t
where s, Rs, and t are the conductivity, sheet resistance, and thickness of the
hydrogels, respectively.
(2) We find it is very difficult to measure the sheet resistance practically during
stretching of the hydrogel, according to the following reasons: (a) The sample needs
to maintain square during measurement using four-point probe station (ST2253-F01
Suzhou JingGe Inc. Figure R3a), but it is difficult to maintain the shape during
stretching; (b) It is difficult to configure the four-point probe station and the stretcher
(Figure R3b) together during the measurement; (c) Water evaporation can affect the
accuracy during the conductivity measurement (Figure R3c), while during the
resistance measurement, the hydrogel electrode is encapsulated.
(3) If the Reviewer has a more straightforward and effective method, we would be
delighted to know and push our research forward by it.

ST2253-F01 four-point probe station. (b) A photograph of homemade stretcher. (c) A
photograph of a half-dried CNT/PVA electrode after water evaporation during stretching.
Our modification to the manuscript: None.
Comment #5 Recently, people can produce high voltage to drive DEA by using self-
powered technique [Adv. Funct. Mater. 26, (2016) 4906-4913; Nano Energy 38 (2017)
91–100; Adv. Funct. Mater. (2017), 27, 1603788]. It is better the author can report some
of these work in their introductions.
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work. We agree that it
necessary to report relevant investigations on high voltage driven DEA self-powered
technique.
Our modification to the manuscript:
(1) In the revised manuscript, on page 1, line 18, “Among them, dielectric elastomer
actuator (DEA) has drawn considerable attentions since the use of electrical potential
is an efficient way to actuate soft robots [4,8,9].” is changed into “Dielectric
elastomer actuator (DEA) among them, composed of a soft dielectric polymer
sandwiched between two compliant electrodes, has drawn considerable attentions for
actuating soft robots efficiently using electrical potential [4,8-12].”
(2) In the Reference section, Refs 10, 11, 12 are added.
Reviewer #2
Comments:
The authors reported carbon nanotube and polyvinyl alcohol-based dielectric elastomer
actuator that has 40% more areal strain and is 200% stretchable. The new structure also
showed self-healing capability due to hydrogen bonding and lower relative resistance
than the other stretchable conductors. I believe the authors have presented interesting
work and have addressed the previous reviewers’ questions. Therefore, I would
recommend the manuscript for publication after a minor revision.
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the precious comments on our work.
Comments #1: It is not elevated that why the authors have chosen specific percentages
for the chemical mixes while preparing the CNT-PVA hydrogel. i.e., 0.32 g PVA, 50g
CNT, 2 hrs ultrasonication. How did they decide these numbers and times? What
happens otherwise?
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work. We have
investigated the electrical properties of hydrogels with different amount of CNTs. As
shown in Figure R4, the relative resistance change of the hydrogel with 25 mg CNT is
slightly higher at larger strain (> ~100%) than that of the hydrogel with 50 mg CNT.
Although the hydrogel with 75 mg CNT has better electrical conductivity than the one
with 50 mg CNT, it cannot reach strain over ~150%. It is thus reasonable to choose the
sample with 50 mg CNT for the further study in the rest of the paper
Figure R4. Relative resistance changes of the hydrogel electrodes prepared using 25, 50,
and 75 mg of CNTs at strain ranging from 0% to 200%.
Our modification to the manuscript:
(1) In the revised manuscript, Figure S4 is added to the Supporting Information.
(2) In the revised manuscript, on page 5, line 7, “Figure 2b shows the current-voltage
curves of the CNT/PVA hydrogel at different strain.” is changed to “Figure 2b shows
the current-voltage curves of the CNT/PVA hydrogel with 50 mg CNT at different
strain.”
(3) In the revised manuscript, on page 5, line 13, “Hydrogels with different amount of
CNTs are investigated to obtain the optimized electrode for the DEA. Figure S4
shows the relative resistance changes of hydrogels with different amount of CNTs.
The sample with 25 mg CNT is slightly higher than that of the hydrogel with 50 mg
CNT at higher strain (> ~100%). Although the hydrogel with 75 mg CNT has better
electrical conductivity than the one with 50 mg CNT, it cannot reach strain over
~150%. Therefore, hydrogel with 50 mg CNT was chosen as the electrode for the
following study.” is added.
Comments #2: It is stated that the hydrogel could repeat its performance up to 1800
cycles without any degradation. Did the authors repeat this lifetime test to the sample
they cut after the self-healing process? Are there any different results observed?
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work. According to the
suggestion from the Reviewer, the stability test for the hydrogel after the cutting-healing
process was investigated under 20% strain for ~2000 cycles, as shown in Figure R5. The
hydrogel electrode can maintain its electromechanical performance within ~500 cycles.
Then the electrical signal starts drifting. After 2000 cycle, the relative resistance change
is 2 times larger than the original value. The possible reason is still under investigation.
Figure R5. The stability test of the CNT/PVA hydrogel after cutting-self healing process.
Our modification to the manuscript:
(1) In the revised manuscript, Figure S6 is added to the Supporting Information.
(2) In the revised manuscript, on page 6, line 23, “Stability of the hydrogel after the
cutting-healing test was further investigated by subjecting it to a cycling test for 2000
cycles (Figure S6). The hydrogel electrode can maintain its electromechanical
performance within ~500 cycles. Then the electrical signal starts drifting. After 2000
cycle, the relative resistance change is 2 times larger than the original value. The
possible reason is still under investigation.” is added.
Comments #3: Writing can be improved.
Our response: We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work. We refine and
improve the manuscript after reviewing it carefully.
Our modification to the manuscript:
(1) In the revised manuscript on page 1, line 12,“In contrast to the rigid-bodied
counterparts, soft robots composed of intrinsically soft and/or extensible materials
with relatively large number of freedom degrees provide an opportunity to bridge the
gap between machines and people, since they can deform and absorb much of the
energy arising from a collision [1,4-7]. is changed to “In contrast to rigid-bodied
counterparts, soft robots composed of intrinsically soft and/or extensible materials
with relatively large number of freedom degrees provide an opportunity to bridge the
gap between machines and human being, since they can deform and absorb much of
the energy arising from a collision [1,4-7].”
(2) In the revised manuscript on page 1, line 16, “Development of soft bodies with large
deformation, high energy density, and short response time is the key challenge for
creating soft robots [5].” is changed to “Development of soft bodies with large
deformation, high energy density, and short response time is key challenge to
fabricate soft robots [5].”
(3) In the revised manuscript on page 1, line 18, “Among them, dielectric elastomer

(4) In the revised manuscript on page 2, line 5, “DEAs consist of a soft dielectric
polymer sandwiched between two compliant electrodes.” is deleted.
