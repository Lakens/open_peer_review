Dear Dr Scholle
Each article must be self-contained. Therefore, referencing other paper does not dispense the
authors from writing a comprehensive introduction, defining all variables and clearly stating
their conclusions.
You manuscript is rejected on these grounds but you may want to write a full article based on it.

The authors obtain an extended Navier-Stokes (NS) type equation, which reduces to the classical
NS eq. in the appropriate limit, using a variational formalism and a proposed Lagrangian density.
This is an approach that I found very interesting. However this was introduced by two of the
authors in an article from 2017, in the same journal (Ref. 12).
They then show that the additional non-classical contributions vanish when time averaged, in the
assumption that the phases of the thermal fluctuation vary much faster in time compared to the
characteristic timescales of the flow. This is the only novel result presented, as far as I can see.
Expanding on the validity of this assumption from the physical perspective of spatial scales
would strengthen this work, as splitting eq. 2.7 just into fast and slow terms leads to the recovery
of the classical NS in a seemingly trivial way. Basically, why do I need eq 2.7 in the first place if
the flow (as in all scales up to the Kolmogorov scale) is always much slower than the phases of
the thermal fluctuations? It would be interesting to list the spatial scale (compared to the
Kolmogorov scale) at which the timescale of the non-equilibrium restoration force is order unity
to the other terms.

The comparison with stochastic variational description is welcomed, but it's quite light.

The article is now in a state that can stand on its own (this has nothing to do with the number of

The impact of the non-equilibrium terms for different flow regimes may yield novel results or
give trivial answers. The community at large will ultimately decide on the practical relevance of
the approach. However, from a mathematical perspective, I fully agree with the authors on their

Appendix A
The goal of the set of equation that this group investigates is to modify the usual
incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations so that there is a second reservoir
for the dissipated energy, is not strictly dissipative and might have a Hamiltonian
formulation. They use Clebsch variables to represent where the energy removed by
viscous effects goes and in this paper, they have added stochastic effects.
What is missing from the beginning of this paper is a physical motivation for
introducing these equations, which seem to be a variation upon, or parameterisation
of, the Navier-Stokes-Duhem equations, without any reference to what those are.
From their earlier paper, they are in a contribution by Olsson that I don't have ready
access to. Also from their earlier paper, the introduction of Clebsch variables might
be relevant to a fluid with dislocations.
As far as this being an extension of true incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes
equation, I would like to believe that an extension with a Stokes viscosity and a
Hamiltonian formulation exists where the loss of kinetic energy through the viscous
terms can be replaced by suitable additional physics.
Other than going back to the compressible Navier-Stokes equation, I don't believe
there is and don't believe that adding a Clebsch pair, inspired by the Madelung
transformation for quantum media, which can generate a phase velocity and even a
pseudovorticity in the manner of Berry, plus some stochasticity, is the solution.
One fundamental problem with this approach is the question of helicity. What role
helicity plays in turbulent flows has never been adequately addressed, except it is
there in observed vortical structures and cannot be represented by a single Clebsch
pair. Due to the extra potential needed to ensure incompressibility, the integrated
helicity for a single Clebsch pair is identically zero. Which means for a physical fluid,
multiple Clebsch pairs will be needed.
Furthermore, there is some literature on the using Clebsch pairs for diagnosis which
the authors do not seem to know. For example
Study on the EulerianLagrangian analysis of NavierStokes turbulence,
K. Ohkitani and P. Constantin, Physics of Fluids 20, 075102 (2008);
C. Cartes, M. Bustamante, and M. E. Brachet, Generalized EulerianLagrangian
description of NavierStokes dynamics, Phys. Fluids 19, 077101 (2007).

mechanisms for geometric depletion, Nonlinearity 31, R25 (2018).

If they pose their solutions as solutions for a Duhem liquid, which I have never hear
of unless it is something like Silly Putty, I will listen. However, as currently posed, I
am against publication.

Authors note to the Editor
We are grateful to the editor for providing us with the opportunity to revise and
resubmit our manuscript and thank the two referees for their very constructive
and insightful comments, enabling us as carry out a complete revision of the
work, both rigorous and thorough, leading to a far superior article via which
the essence of our work is more clearly articulated.
We are confident, based on the thorough revision carried out, that the new
version of the manuscript addresses the concerns raised by the referees in full,
showing the connection to existing approaches/theories.
Authors reply to the Referees
We would like to begin by thanking the referee for their frank and honest opinion
as to the content of our manuscript and for taking the time to point us in the
right direction as to its essential improvement.
Reviewer: 1
The authors obtain an extended Navier-Stokes (NS) type equation, which re-
duces to the classical NS eq. in the appropriate limit, using a variational formal-
ism and a proposed Lagrangian density. This is an approach that I found very
interesting. However this was introduced by two of the authors in an article
from 2017, in the same journal (Ref. 12).
Reviewers comment: They then show that the additional non-classical con-
tributions vanish when time averaged, in the assumption that the phases of the
thermal fluctuation vary much faster in time compared to the characteristic
timescales of the flow. This is the only novel result presented, as far as I can
see. Expanding on the validity of this assumption from the physical perspective
of spatial scales would strengthen this work, as splitting eq. 2.7 just into fast
and slow terms leads to the recovery of the classical NS in a seemingly trivial
way.
Authors reply: We thank the reviewer for these fruitful hints. We agree
that spatial averaging would provide an interesting alternative to time aver-
aging and would strengthen this work, while expecting the same result as in
turbulence theory due to ergodic hypothesis. We started investigating in this
variant but need more time to work it out. The main reason for this is that
the discontinuities appearing in the theory become manifest as wave-like struc-
tures on a microscopic scale. By spatial averaging they become micro-solitons
the detailed analysis of which is required before serious conclusions about their
physical meaning can be drawn. The necessary studies of the solutions of the
corresponding evolution equation for the thermal excitation will require some
time, but we are confident to provide results in forthcoming papers. At least
1
we have discussed the idea of spatial averaging in Sec. 2(c) and in the outlook
section 5.
Reviewers comment: Basically, why do I need eq 2.7 in the first place if
the flow (as in all scales up to the Kolmogorov scale) is always much slower than
the phases of the thermal fluctuations? It would be interesting to list the spatial
scale (compared to the Kolmogorov scale) at which the timescale of the non-
equilibrium restoration force is order unity to the other terms. The comparison
with stochastic variational description is welcomed, but its quite light.
Authors reply: The equation of motion 2.9 (2.7 in the original manuscript)
results from the Lagrangian 2.1 by variation, so the question is not if this equa-
tion is needed or not, but the question is if an alternative Lagrangian exists
that provides an equation of motion without additional non-equilibrium terms.
Based on prior works, from Millikan to our RSOS paper from 2017, no alter-
native Lagrangian delivering full Navier-Stokes equations (without introducing
additional fields without physical meaning in the sense of a weak formulation)
is available, apart from the one provided in the framework of the first integral
approach in Sec. 2(d).
However, the question arises if the non-equilibrium terms occurring in the
equation of motion are relevant in turbulent considering the time Kolmogorov
scale t<U+03B7> . At least, by 2p/t<U+03B7> > <U+03C9>0 a rough criterium is given for a Reynolds num-
ber regime where the thermal fluctuations and the no-classical terms occurring
in the equations of motion should be without any relevance. This opens the
perspective to use the discontinuous Lagrangian approach directly without time
averaging, making the implementation of it easier. Without any doubt it would
have been more consequent and satisfying to list a separate spatial scale for
comparison with the Kolmogorov scale. Unfortunately an application for fund-
ing a research project related to the application of our unconventional methods
to turbulent flow has been refused by the DFG, so our research capacities are
quite restricted and we are sorry that we can address your suggestion only in
this minimalistic manner. At least our rough considerations has been added
in a separate section 2(e), where also the use of the alternative approaches is
discussed at different Re-regimes. We are thankful to the reviewer pointing on
this relevant question.
Reviewers comment: While I enjoyed reading this articled, I find it to be
more of a comment on their previous work than a standalone research article.
The authors should greatly expand on the deterministic versus stochastic ap-
proaches aspect of the work. At this point, I do not recommend publication of
this work.

Authors reply
We agree that the original version of the article was at an early stage. Mean-
while we gained some progress on this field, especially by extending the theory
from incompressible to compressible flow and working out an example which
both have been added to the revised version. Since reviewer 2 had relevant con-
cerns about the foundations of our approach in general and doubted its validity
for compressible flow in particular, it was necessary to extend the approach to
compressible flow. Although a Lagrangian is already provided in the prior paper
(RSOS 2017), its associated Euler-Lagrange equations and resulting equations
of motion have never been worked out and discussed, showing that the formalism
equally well works for compressible as for incompressible flows. We also provide
a slight modification of the Lagrangian leading to a simplified treatment. In
order to demonstrate its capabilities, the method is applied to damped acous-
tic waves, which is elaborated in section 4. The treatment of damped acoustic
waves includes also the use of statistics and provides a criterion up to which
frequency the classical solution remains valid. Unfortunately no comparative
results coming from stochastic variational approach are available at the mo-
ment, as A. B. Cruzeiro stated in a private communication. In the meantime
(Apr. 2018) also an alternative approach has been published, the first integral
approach, providing a continuous Lagrangian but being restricted to steady and
therefore laminar flows. We also address this approach.
We hope that the reviewer agree that the revised version of our manuscript,
which has twice the number of pages as the original one, can be considered as
a standalone research article rather than a comment to our prior work now.
Reviewer: 2
Reviewers comment: The goal of the set of equation that this group
investigates is to modify the usual incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes equa-
tions so that there is a second reservoir for the dissipated energy, is not strictly
dissipative and might have a Hamiltonian formulation.
Authors reply: This is indeed not the goal: it was e.g. the goal of the prior
paper, RSOS 2017; 4(2), and has been reached considering thermal degrees of
freedom. In fact the goal is to show how the prior work can be reinterpreted
from a statistical viewpoint, ending up with a modified approach, which we now
call a pseudo-statistical one, that is closer to the classical theory. We regret
that the real intention of our manuscript was misunderstood and thank the
reviewer for pointing to this. To make it clearer, we have revised the abstract
and Sect. 1(d) (formerly 1(c)), hoping that the aim of the paper is now much
clearer and unambiguous.
Reviewers comment: They use Clebsch variables to represent where the
energy removed by viscous effects goes and in this paper, they have added
stochastic effects.
3
Authors reply: In fact we use Clebsch variables, but the dissipated energy
does not go to the Clebsch variables, it goes to the internal energy (thermal
engery, heat) in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics and causes an
increase of the entropy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.
This has been discussed in the prior paper, RSOS 2017; 4(2), but for clarification
we added some sentences for explaining the engery transfer. We again thank
the reviewer for advising us to this.
Reviewers comment: What is missing from the beginning of this paper is a
physical motivation for introducing these equations, which seem to be a variation
upon, or parameterisation of, the Navier-Stokes-Duhem equations, without any
reference to what those are. From their earlier paper, they are in a contribution
by Olsson that I dont have ready access to. Also from their earlier paper, the
introduction of Clebsch variables might be relevant to a fluid with dislocations.
Authors reply: The Navier-Stokes-Duhem equations are simply the Navier-
Stokes equations for compressible flow. Although this terminology is not widely
spread, we prefer it for distinguishing the compressible from the incompressible
case, since Navier-Stokes equations is mostly understood as the Navier-Stokes
equations for incompressible flow. We have added sub-sentence explaining the
latter. Moreover, we added a reference to a second textbook by Belevich (next
to Olssons one) making use of this terminology.
Reviewers comment: As far as this being an extension of true incompress-
ible viscous Navier-Stokes equation, I would like to believe that an extension
with a Stokes viscosity and a Hamiltonian formulation exists where the loss of
kinetic energy through the viscous terms can be replaced by suitable additional
physics. Other than going back to the compressible Navier-Stokes equation, I
dont believe there is and dont believe that adding a Clebsch pair, inspired by
the Madelung transformation for quantum media, which can generate a phase
velocity and even a pseudovorticity in the manner of Berry, plus some stochas-
ticity, is the solution.
Authors reply: We are surprised about this statement since compressible
flow has not been considered throughout the entire manuscript (original sub-
mitted version), therefore we do not understand this point of criticism. Never-
theless we address this point in the revised version by adding a new section in
which the theory for compressible flow is worked out in detail, showing that the
formalism equally well works for compressible as for incompressible flows. In
order to demonstrate its capabilities, the method is applied to damped acoustic
waves, which is elaborated in the following section. We again thank the reviewer
for bringing our attention to this relevant question.
Reviewers comment: One fundamental problem with this approach is the
question of helicity. What role helicity plays in turbulent flows has never been
4
adequately addressed, except it is there in observed vortical structures and
cannot be represented by a single Clebsch pair. Due to the extra potential
needed to ensure incompressibility, the integrated helicity for a single Clebsch
pair is identically zero. Which means for a physical fluid, multiple Clebsch pairs
will be needed. Furthermore, there is some literature on the using Clebsch pairs
for diagnosis which the authors do not seem to know. For example Study on the
EulerianLagrangian analysis of NavierStokes turbulence, K. Ohkitani and P.
Constantin, Physics of Fluids 20, 075102 (2008); C. Cartes, M. Bustamante, and
M. E. Brachet, Generalized EulerianLagrangian description of NavierStokes
dynamics, Phys. Fluids 19, 077101 (2007). and most recently: K. Ohkitani,
Study of the 3D Euler equations using Clebsch potentials: dual mechanisms for
geometric depletion, Nonlinearity 31, R25 (2018). Koji Ohkitani Published 2
January 2018.
Authors reply: We are aware of this issue and addressed this question al-
ready in our two earlier papers RSOS 2017; 4(2) and PLA 2016; 380(40). Being
also aware that meanwhile decades of research has been spent to the question
of the existence of the Clebsch representation depending on the vortex topology
of the flow, we are thankful to the reviewer referencing the most recent articles
published on this research field, which we have cited now. Nevertheless, it is
not our aim to provide an own contribution to the latter, in fact the aim of this
paper is a different one, as already mentioned above. To hedge ones bets, we
have replaced the single Clebsch pair a<U+2207>ß by ai <U+2207>ßi = a1 <U+2207>ß1 + a2 <U+2207>ß2 + · · ·
leaving it open how many pairs are needed for the individual flow topology.
Reviewers comment: If they pose their solutions as solutions for a Duhem
liquid, which I have never hear of unless it is something like Silly Putty, I will
listen.
Authors reply
We are again sorry for this misunderstanding: the solutions of the Navier-Stokes-
Duhem equations (= Navier-Stokes equation for compressible flow) are not the
solutions for a Duhem fluid. At the moment we prefer focussing our research
to the Newtonian case with application to examples like the damped acoustic
waves provided in Sec. 4. Nevertheless, there is indeed a perspective to apply the
discontinuous Lagrangian approach to non-Newtonian frames, which is slightly
sketched in the outlook section 5.
