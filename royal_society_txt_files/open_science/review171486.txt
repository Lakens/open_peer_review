Title: Environmentally friendly and breathable wet-laid hydroentangled nonwovens for personal
hygiene care with excellent water absorbency and flushability
General comments:
This is a carefully written article, which clearly describes some research. The topic is technically
interesting and challenging. The work is focused on processes that are important in industry.
The work is sufficiently novel. There are some minor ways in which the document can be
improved.
Specific comments:
1. Page 3, line 40/41: The term “interlaced” is likely to be confusing to readers. The authors
need to remember that they are describing a non-woven material. The root-word “lace” (as in
lacing a shoe) suggests weaving. It is suggested that the authors avoid the word “interlaced” and
instead give a lengthier explanation of exactly what they mean. Conventional wet-laid sheets are
made by filtration of highly dilute suspensions of fibers, so most of the fibers will end up oriented
in the same plane as the sheet, within relatively narrow hypothetical layers.
2. Page 4, line 9: The numbers “13.1 MPa” and “2.8 MPa” caught my attention. It seems that the
authors need to give a more complete description of the context and maybe do some additional
tests. Yes, maybe the lower wet tensile modulus is due to there being more water in the sheet.
But it is important to also evaluate the modulus at a controlled moisture content. Presumably, by
application of more vacuum, the wet tensile modulus of the hydroentangled sheet can be
returned to the same moisture content as what it is being compared to. Then the wet-modulus
tests can be repeated. This is important because readers will suspect that the hydroentanglement
may have interfered with the uniformity within the sheet. Also, they may be concerned that out-
of-plane orientation of fibers will automatically lead to lower within-plane strength.
3. It is further recommended to evaluate the DRY in-plane strength of the sheet to test the
hypothesis that the hydroentanglement (due to making the sheet less uniform or changing the
orientation away from being mostly in-plane) will weaken the sheet relative to tensile stress in
the plane of the sheet.

be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Reviewer: 1
This is a carefully written article, which clearly describes some research. The topic is technically
interesting and challenging. The work is focused on processes that are important in industry.
The work is sufficiently novel. There are some minor ways in which the document can be
improved
1. Page 3, line 40/41: The term “interlaced” is likely to be confusing to readers. The authors
need to remember that they are describing a non-woven material. The root-word “lace” (as in
lacing a shoe) suggests weaving. It is suggested that the authors avoid the word “interlaced” and
instead give a lengthier explanation of exactly what they mean. Conventional wet-laid sheets are
made by filtration of highly dilute suspensions of fibers, so most of the fibers will end up
oriented in the same plane as the sheet, within relatively narrow hypothetical layers.
Response: Thank you for pointing out the confusing term “interlaced”. We have now revised the
description in our revised manuscript (Page 3).
“During the wet-laid process, pulp and Tencel fibers with a ratio of 4:1 (w/w) are used to
produce fiber web. For the fiber web produced by wet-laid technique, no obvious entangling
structures between fibers are found. In contrast, most Tencel fibers and pulp fibers are stacked
on each other tightly, orienting in the same plane as the sheet, within relatively narrow
hypothetical layers (figure 4a and b). This phenomenon should be attributed to the combined
principles of filtration and thickening during the wet-laid process. The water in the slurry is
drained and the fibers are deposited on the forming wire randomly under the effect of suction.”
2. Page 4, line 9: The numbers “13.1 MPa” and “2.8 MPa” caught my attention. It seems that
the authors need to give a more complete description of the context and maybe do some
additional tests. Yes, maybe the lower wet tensile modulus is due to there being more water in
the sheet. But it is important to also evaluate the modulus at a controlled moisture content.
Presumably, by application of more vacuum, the wet tensile modulus of the hydroentangled
sheet can be returned to the same moisture content as what it is being compared to. Then the
1
wet-modulus tests can be repeated. This is important because readers will suspect that the
hydroentanglement may have interfered with the uniformity within the sheet. Also, they may be
concerned that out-of-plane orientation of fibers will automatically lead to lower within-plane
strength.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. The wet tensile modulus of wet-laid fiber web and
nonwovens were examined at the same controlled moisture content of 200%. We agree that the
hydroentanglement influences on fiber orientation and thus within-plane strength. We have
updated the discussion in our revised manuscript (Pages 2 and 4).
“The tensile strength, modulus and breaking elongation are examined using an electronic fabric
strength tester (YG026MB, Wenzhou Fangyuan Instrument Co., LTD, Wenzhou, China).
Specifically, the moisture content of samples for the wet tensile test, the size of the samples for
both longitudinal (MD) and transverse (CD) directions, the clamp distance, and the stretching
rate are 200%, 50 × 250 mm2, 200 mm, and 100 mm min-1, respectively.”
“As for the wet tensile modulus, a huge decrease from 13.1 ± 1.3 MPa to 2.8 ± 0.8 MPa of wet-
laid fiber web is shown at MD direction after hydroentanglement (figure 5e). This phenomenon
could be attributed to the resultant fluffy and bulkier structure induced by the hydroentanglement
process, and thus out-of-plane orientation of fibers lead to lower within-plane strength.”
3. It is further recommended to evaluate the DRY in-plane strength of the sheet to test the
hypothesis that the hydroentanglement (due to making the sheet less uniform or changing the
orientation away from being mostly in-plane) will weaken the sheet relative to tensile stress in
the plane of the sheet.
Response: Thank you for this insightful suggestion. We have added the DRY in-plane strength
of the sheet to support the hypothesis. Details on the analysis of dry in-plane strength have been
included in the revised manuscript (Page 4).
“Regarding the dry tensile strength, interesting results can be found in figure 5c and d. The dry
tensile strength values of wet-laid fiber web, wet-laid hydroentangled nonwovens and bathroom
tissue are 2.61 ± 0.09 MPa, 1.06 ± 0.12 MPa, 2.71 ± 0.05 MPa at MD direction, and 1.70 ± 0.07
MPa, 0.51 ± 0.09 MPa, 1.74 ± 0.06 MPa at CD direction, respectively. The dry tensile strength
2
of wet-laid fiber web is much higher than that of wet-laid hydroentangled nonwovens, which is
opposite to the tendency of wet tensile strength. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact
that wet-laid fiber web has a structure that fibers mostly stay in-plane, resulting in stronger
hydrogen bonds and thus higher tensile strength at dry status. While hydroentanglement makes
the fiber orientation away from being mostly in-plane, which is logical that wet-laid
hydroentangled nonwovens have weaker tensile strength at dry status. However, in wet status
physical entanglements mainly contribute to the mechanical properties, endowing wet-laid
hydroentangled nonwovens with better mechanical properties than that of wet-laid fiber web.
With regard to bathroom tissue, the dry tensile strength of wet-laid fiber web is lower than that
of bathroom tissue, which should be attributed to the added binder in the bathroom tissue.”

Response: We thank the reviewer for the good suggestion to enhance our manuscript. We have
now included this paper on water absorbency in the literature review section in our revised
manuscript (Page 1).
“Wet-laid materials refer to papers, wet napkin, nonwovens, etc. [7-10]. Among them, papers
are mostly widely used due to their good degradability and high water absorption property [11-
13].”
