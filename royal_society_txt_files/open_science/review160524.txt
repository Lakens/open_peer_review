Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The manuscript present some interesting results on the Cr(IV) adsorption on three different
oxides, NiO, CoO and ZnO. They authors successfully carried out solvothermal synthesis of
these oxides. They were characterised by XRD, SEM and IEP techniques. They show the
presence of phase pure materials with different morphologies. They also show the amount of
hydroxyls present in these systems and the adsorption capacity of high concentration of Cr(VI).
Finally they show typical allowed concentration of 50 µg in water and its adsorption capacity.
I feel the manuscript may be improved by modifying/addressing the following before
considering this for publication
1. XRD data shows nice phase purity of the system and SEM shows different
morphologies. However, it appears from the figure that NiO has the smallest crystallite size and
CoO the largest. They failed to comment on the crystallite size (they comment only on the
particle size) which is important when correlating with number of hydroxyls
2. It is not clear why they have chosen high concentration in the first place while low
concentration data is more important for applications
3. In the experimental section range of concentrations of Cr(IV) in solution and used and
one set of results using 100 mg/L. it is not clear to me why such range of concentrations were
used? A clearer justification for these range could be useful
4. Figure captions are inadequate to follow the content of the figures. For example, Figure
5 a-c shows data using 100 mg/L of Cr(VI) and only 5d shows 50 µg/L. Whilst this low
concentration appears to be critical for further applications, the authors could have given more
kinetic information of the low concentration study rather than one simple bar chart. Also the OH
concentration of CoO appears to be high and shows least adsorption for low concentration
sample. The authors should show a comparison plot of 100 mg/L with 50 µg/L in this chart and
show concentration effects
5. Recyclability results look good. What is missing is whether the phase purity and
morphology is retained (a) after adsorption and (b) after removing the adsorbed Cr(VI) using
NaOH. Also it will be useful to show some data on whether they were able to remove all the
adsorbed Cr(VI) from the adsorbent using this procedure. This will provide evidence for the
nature of the adsorbent and its efficient functions.

Overall the manuscript is very poorly written. No proper structure is there. Simply experiments
have been done. Results and discussion part is not up to the mark. Authors have no idea about
the novelty of this study.
Few specific comments are provided below.
1) In Materials and methods, how much amount of propanediol, octanol and ethylene
glycol were used during the synthesis of metal oxides adsorbents? Authors should mention this
in materials and methods section.
2) In page 3, line 32-40, Characterization part is very poorly written. Authors should re-
write in detail about the X-ray analysis and SEM.
3) Authors have calculated surface hydroxyl densities with regard to NiO, ZnO and CoO
adsorbents. The different values have been reported, so adsorbent with highest surface hydroxyl
densities will show more adsorption for the removal of Cr? No information is provided in this
context?
4) Effect of pH studies was done after the kinetics and isotherm studies. Why?

If the comments from reviewer 1 are addressed with some consideration of those from reviewer 2
then this manscript is appropriate for publication. I disagree with reviewer 2 as I did not think
the manuscript was poorly written but further explanation would enhance the submission.

Comments to the Author:
label_comment_4
The authors should note that both referees raise serious issues regarding the conduct of the
experiments in terms of the materials used and the need for more justification as far as the
methodology is concerned. Referee 1 in particular raises a number of questions regarding the lack
of experimental detail in some sections.
Attention should also be paid to the overall structure of the paper and the authors should
comment on the originality of their work and why it merits publication.

To reviewer 1
Q.1. XRD data shows nice phase purity of the system and SEM shows different
morphologies. However, it appears from the figure that NiO has the smallest
crystallite size and CoO the largest. They failed to comment on the crystallite size
(they comment only on the particle size) which is important when correlating with
number of hydroxyls.
A. Thanks for your valuable suggestion. We have provided the crystallite sizes of
these adsorbents in our new version. The manuscript has been revised accordingly and
marked in blue.
Q.2. It is not clear why they have chosen high concentration in the first place while
low concentration data is more important for applications.
A. Thanks for your valuable comment. We agree with your statement that the low
concentration data is more important for drinking-water applications. But from the
viewpoint of industrial sewage, the treatment of high concentration of Cr(VI) is
significantly important. It was reported that effluents from certain industries often
contain 50-100 mg L-1 of Cr(VI), which are over 1,000 times higher than the
maximum allowed concentration of standard for wastewater discharge (ref. 21 in our
new version). Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the Cr(VI) concentration to an
acceptable level before discharging into the environment. The manuscript has been
revised accordingly and marked in blue.
Q.3. In the experimental section range of concentrations of Cr(IV) in solution and
used and one set of results using 100 mg/L. it is not clear to me why such range of
concentrations were used? A clearer justification for these range could be useful.
A. Thanks for your valuable comment. In this work, we aim to develop a set of
efficient and effective adsorbents for sewage disposal. The effluents from certain
industries were reported to contain 50-100 mg L-1 of Cr(VI) (ref. 21 in our new
version). Herein, the concentration of Cr(VI) was selected to be 100 mg L-1 in our
Introduction part. The manuscript has been revised accordingly and marked in blue.
Q.4. Figure captions are inadequate to follow the content of the figures. For example,
Figure 5 a-c shows data using 100 mg/L of Cr(VI) and only 5d shows 50 µg/L. Whilst
this low concentration appears to be critical for further applications, the authors could
have given more kinetic information of the low concentration study rather than one
simple bar chart. Also the OH concentration of CoO appears to be high and shows
least adsorption for low concentration sample. The authors should show a comparison
plot of 100 mg/L with 50 µg/L in this chart and show concentration effects
A. Thanks for your valuable comment. The manuscript has been revised accordingly
and marked in blue.
Q.5. Recyclability results look good. What is missing is whether the phase purity and
morphology is retained (a) after adsorption and (b) after removing the adsorbed Cr(VI)
using NaOH. Also it will be useful to show some data on whether they were able to
remove all the adsorbed Cr(VI) from the adsorbent using this procedure. This will
provide evidence for the nature of the adsorbent and its efficient functions.

and marked in blue.

A. Thanks for your valuable suggestion. We have provided the crystallite sizes of
these adsorbents in our new version. The manuscript has been revised accordingly and
marked in blue.
Q.3. Authors have calculated surface hydroxyl densities with regard to NiO, ZnO and
CoO adsorbents. The different values have been reported, so adsorbent with highest
surface hydroxyl densities will show more adsorption for the removal of Cr? No
information is provided in this context?
A. Thanks for your valuable comment. We have stated this point at the end of Results
and Discussion section. The manuscript has been revised accordingly and marked in
blue.
Q.4. Effect of pH studies was done after the kinetics and isotherm studies. Why?
A. Thanks for your valuable comment. In this work, all the kinetics and isotherm
studies were carried out at pH= 5.02-5.66 without further adjustment. This will be
quite suitable for practical water treatment. After these experiments, the pH studies
were performed, because pH value has significant influence on the adsorption
capacity of adsorbents.
