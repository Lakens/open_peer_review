A comparative approach to vocal communication is always welcome but rarely done. Therefore,
this paper looking at greeting calls in the philopatric sex is a good start. The authors study four
species said to be of similar socioecology, but given that chimpanzees are considered to be a
fission-fusion species and are male philopatric whereas vervets and baboons are usually
classified as having stable cohesive social groups with female philopatry, can these really be
considered similar in socioecology? Furthermore, the title refers to universals in greeting calls but
the data do not support such a strong claim. Vervet monkey females produced no greeting calls,
and low ranking animals called more than high ranking animals in the other species, but with
important species differences. Target animals called more often in chimpanzees and approaching
animals more in the other two species. Lower ranked animals with greater dyadic rank
differences called more in chimpanzees with the opposite being true in mangabeys and little
difference in baboons. This does not seem like a universal pattern.
If one were to accept that these species all have similar socioecologies, the main conclusion would
appear to be “Diversity in Greeting Calls”.
I can appreciate why the authors do not analyze the results for vervet monkeys since there were
no greeting calls, but this species is completely mossing in the Method sections describing how
data were collected. No mention is made of sampling method or intensity of sampling. Does this
mean that observations on vervet monkeys were casual and not systematic? Could that explain
the lack of greeting calls? More needs to be presented on methods to assure a reader that strong
methods were used on all species.
Why was focal animal sampling used with baboons and mangabeys but scan sampling with
chimpanzees? Should not similar methods be used for better comparison?
Sex is also a confounding variable in the study. Yes, male chimpanzees are philopatric, but also
have more overt aggressive interactions than female chimpanzees and females of the other
species. If vervet monkeys produce greeting calls but never among females, then this also
suggests a sex difference in calling in this species. The research seems incomplete without
disentangling possible effects of sex from those of philopatry. The authors are likely to have
gathered data on both sexes as part of their research and adding those data would make this
paper stronger and provide more insights into the proximate usage and ultimate function of
greeting calls.
It was also striking that greeting calls appeared so rarely. This raises questions about their
function and usage that the current paper does not answer. A skeptic might question why it is of
interest to pursue research on greeting calls if they are rare. Is there any evidence of what
happens with a dyadic approach in the absence of greeting calls? If aggression is more likely or
social interactions less likely without greeting calls, then this makes them of more interest and
helps explain their role in social groups. What can the authors say about social interactions in the
absence of greeting? Some further analysis of the dyadic approach data without any calling
already gathered would be helpful in resolving this.
The authors criticize the approach of Laporte et al. which led to different conclusions about
chimpanzees but that study focused on females so the results may not be directly comparable.
The authors would have better ground for criticizing Laporte if their data on female greeting calls
differed from Laporte et al.
Table 2 might be more informative if there were also summary lines excluding he silent vervet
monkeys.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In the paper „Universals of vocal greeting in four primate species“ the authors compare vocal
greeting behaviour across four different primate species and discuss species-specific differences
in the function of these calls. The paper is very well written, the introduction is clear, the method
section contains all necessary information’s, the results can be easily followed and I appreciate
the comparative approach. In the discussion, I have problems to follow some interpretation of the
results:
1) The authors argue that chimpanzees use the greeting call to signal submission whereas
baboons and mangabeys signal friendly intent but the authors did not differentiate between the
contexts of encounter or present any data on the quality of encounter. Thus, to make this
statement I would expect that they use context (Agonistic versus affiliative) as an additional
predictor variable in the GLMM model.
2) In my opinion, the result for mangabeys that low-ranking animals produce more calls than
high-ranking animals (predictor = Elo-rating) contradicts the finding that high-ranking animals
produce more calls to low-ranking animals (predictor = Elo-rating differences). Do you have an
explanation for that? I was also wondering whether a simple classification in dominant versus
subdominant encounter partner would be better than the Elo-rating score, which is in my opinion
sensitive to the order of encounters. In Fig. 2 it looks that the calling probability is more affected if
the Elo-rating is negative (larger decrease) than if it is positive (almost no decrease for positive
differences)
3) I further was wondering whether the two predictor variables role and elo-differences showed
an interaction. Thus, low-ranking approach more often than higher-ranking individuals?
Minor comment:
L.170: I was confused that there was no description for vervet monkeys because the information
that they were excluded from the analysis was mentioned later in the manuscript.
L.176: “Calculate” is a little bit misleading, because the reader expect some formula. Maybe you
4
can rephrase it or add using the Elo-rating.
L.250 – 253: This was not clear. How you define interpretable terms? Is it possible to write until
the main terms and significant interactions remained? When I calculate GLMMs I test the new
model against the old model until there is no significant differences between both models. Did
you checked whether removing terms significantly improved the model?
L.286-287: Is there a possibility to have pairwise comparisons for each species. From Fig 2 the
difference for mangabeys looks not very significant to me.
L. 310: You wrote that you observed no greeting calls for vervet monkeys (L.268), but the authors
already published a paper about greeting calls in this species (ref. 11). Do you have an
explanation why you did not record these calls in the present study. Why did you include this
species in the paper?
Fig. 1: I would add the vervets even if the mean is zero, then the reader can extract it on the first
look.
Fig 2: I was wondering why there are 24 crosses for mangabeys if the authors observed only 18
individuals.

serious concerns that may need some time to address, so a reject/resub decision will give the
authors time to do that. Please take into account all comments, and thanks for your submission.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Claudia Wascher):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
This is an interesting paper, investigating vocal greeting behaviour in four species of primates,
depending on individual features, dyadic relationships and audience effects. The authors
describe species differences in calling behaviour. Calling propensity was affected by dominance
rank of the focal individual and dominance relationship between initiator of an interaction and
the target of an interaction. The strength of the relationship between individuals and audience
composition did not affect calling behaviour. Both reviewers highlight the importance of
conducting comparative approaches in vocal communication, as such the proposed contribution
is an important one, however both reviewers also raise several concerns with the manuscript in
its present form, which need to be addressed prior to publication. Additionally, to the reviewers’
comments I would also recommend the authors to briefly summarize the direction of the main
results in the abstract, rather than simply stating that they found an effect. Further, the authors
selected four study species, based on the similarity in their socio-ecology as they claim, however
as reviewer 1 points out, this might be an over-statement. In line with this, the authors did not
record greeting vocalizations in vervet monkeys, something which according to the introduction
is against the prediction, as references are provided showing that vervet monkeys do actually
produce vocalisations in interactions. This begs the question why the authors could not replicate
previous finding, and it is probably due to the lower frequency of encounters recorded for vervet
monkey, in comparison with the frequency of encounters recorded in other species. Differences in
sampling effort between species, both, in regards to frequency of interactions and also number of
individuals observed are a serious concern as the study claims to compare species and this needs
to be addressed prior to publication.

The original premise of this paper was that among species with similar socioecology, greeting
calls among members of the philopatric sex would be similar across species. The original reviews
questioned whether the species were in fact similar in social ecology and noted that there were
many differences among the four species studied. The authors have addressed these concerns
quite well in their revision and now emphasize that their work focuses mainly on proximate
mechanisms rather than on functional aspects. All of this is quite good and the manuscript now
more accurately reflects what was done and what results were obtained. However, the points that
would have made this an exciting paper suitable for a Royal Society publication are no longer
present. The current manuscript would make a fine contribution to a high quality specialized
journal on primate behavior and ecology, but I’m not sure it will have the broad appeal that is
typically looked for by the Royal Society, although I gather that is not relevant to Open Science.
I’ll leave it to the action editor to make that call.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
Authors addressed almost all requests of former referees. Regarding the revision, there were
some minors, which I will outline below.
1. Title. Authors modified the title and the introduction in the revision to fulfill the requirements
of the former referees. According to my view, the modified title implies that authors will address
proximate mechanisms of vocal production, e.g. neural, hormonal, genetic, developmental
networks or modifications of the peripheral vocal tract affecting vocal production. However, this
is not what authors have studied in the MS. They studied the occurrence of vocalizations, given
during approach behavior in dyads of the philopatric sex in a social group of four species of
nonhuman primates and consider thereby the rank of the focal animal, dominance relationships
and social roles within dyads, and audience effects, see also line 81 ff. It is on the Editor to decide
whether the modified title reflects what authors mean.
2. “Greeting” calls are functionally defined calls. In this MS, authors term vocalizations, given
during approach behavior of a focal animal “Greeting” calls. The function of these calls, however,
is not yet known for the respective species and according to authors will not be addressed in this
MS. Such a situation makes a comparison across species tricky since you may compare then
apples with oranges.
3. Abstract. Line 36: dominance rank. Do you mean dominance or rank order?
4. In the Abstract, authors use the term “dyadic approach”. Please address in the methods the
link between dyadic approach and an “encounter”.
5. Introduction. Line 74. Please embed Scheumannn et al. 2017 to refer to current knowledge on
how primate “greeting” calls can be defined and studied (Scheumann, M.; Linn, S.; Zimmermann,
E.: Vocal greeting during mother-infant reunions in a nocturnal primate, the gray mouse lemur
(Microcebus murinus). In: Scientific Reports 7 (2017) 10321 )
6. Line 113: Please give reference for the divergence in the acoustic structure of “greeting” calls
between the four studied species.
7. Methods. 157 ff and Discussion. As one of the former referees mentioned, not the same
methods were applied for all species. This is still the case in the revised MS. Please outline in the
discussion how this situation may have shaped your findings. Further, one of the referees
mentioned that authors did not present any data on the context of an encounter or the quality of
an encounter. This issue remains in the revised MS and thus should be addressed in the
discussion.
8. Line 258. Please outline the concept of Elo-rating here so that the general audience will be well
informed upon the procedure you used here for comparative purposes. To refer to a reference is
not sufficient to understand the content of your paper.
9. Abstract/Results: I still share the opinion of referee 2 that the following findings for
mangabeys are difficult to understand: “low ranking animals were more likely to call than high-
ranking ones” and “calling being negatively associated with rank distance ” (see e.g. Abstract).
Please, address this issue in the discussion to make your findings better understandable for the
general audience.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Claudia Wascher):
Thank you very much for submitting a revised version of your manuscript. I have now received
reports from both original reviewers and both acknowledge that their previous comments have
been addressed. However, they raise concerns that the focus has significantly shifted from the
first version of the manuscript. I do not necessarily believe that this made the manuscript
unsuitable for Royal Society Open Science. The journal aims at publishing manuscripts that are
considered scientifically sound and sufficiently advance scientific knowledge. The judgement as
to importance and significance is left to the individual reader. The reviewers have confirmed that
your contribution is scientifically sound and I do believe that your manuscript has the potential
to advance scientific knowledge, as the focus on proximate mechanisms of behaviour is ofter
underrepresented. In this respect I believe your manuscript could make an important
contribution. I am afraid that at the present stage, the focus of the manuscript is not entirely clear.
I do not recognise what the advantage of a comparative approach to study mechanisms of vocal
greetings, in comparison to study these aspects in a single species? Did you have specific
predictions that, for some characteristics in their ecology and/or social system, the species' would
respond similar or different? If you do not have clear predictions with regards to the species
compared, it might be worth to shift the focus away from it even more. In your introduction you
presently state that studying mechanisms of behaviour is important and comparing species is
important, but you do not explain to the reader why this is important and what we can learn
from it, e.g. why is it important to understand how relationships between individuals affect vocal
behaviour? You very specifically describe the details about what you studied, but you do not
explain why this is important, e.g. why the different levels of analysis matter. You nicely describe
what individual species do with regards to vocal behaviour, but you do not explain what we
learn from this about the importance of the behaviour. Parts of this is already present in the
discussion but it can certainly be highlighted more in the introduction.
I hope you find the detailed comments made by the reviewers and my overall comments useful
when preparing a revision of your manuscript.

journal on primate behavior and ecology, but I’m not sure it will have the broad appeal that is
typically looked for by the Royal Society, although I gather that is not relevant to Open Science.
I’ll leave it to the action editor to make that call.
Minor Points:
l. 80 use “whereas” or “although” rather than “while”
l. 120, “whereas” not “while”
l. 226, all animals or just males, since males are the focus.
13
l. 247 all animals or all females?
l. 325 define LRT on first mention
l. 364 “whereas” not “while”
l. 497 after arguing that the paper is not interested in function, function is now introduced.
l. 523 can you give some examples of which types of species would be most fruitful for future
research and why?

Comments to the Author(s)
Authors addressed almost all requests of former referees. Regarding the revision, there were
some minors, which I will outline below.
1. Title. Authors modified the title and the introduction in the revision to fulfill the requirements
of the former referees. According to my view, the modified title implies that authors will address
proximate mechanisms of vocal production, e.g. neural, hormonal, genetic, developmental
networks or modifications of the peripheral vocal tract affecting vocal production. However, this
is not what authors have studied in the MS. They studied the occurrence of vocalizations, given
during approach behavior in dyads of the philopatric sex in a social group of four species of
nonhuman primates and consider thereby the rank of the focal animal, dominance relationships
and social roles within dyads, and audience effects, see also line 81 ff. It is on the Editor to decide
whether the modified title reflects what authors mean.
2. “Greeting” calls are functionally defined calls. In this MS, authors term vocalizations, given
during approach behavior of a focal animal “Greeting” calls. The function of these calls, however,
is not yet known for the respective species and according to authors will not be addressed in this
MS. Such a situation makes a comparison across species tricky since you may compare then
apples with oranges.
3. Abstract. Line 36: dominance rank. Do you mean dominance or rank order?
4. In the Abstract, authors use the term “dyadic approach”. Please address in the methods the
link between dyadic approach and an “encounter”.
5. Introduction. Line 74. Please embed Scheumannn et al. 2017 to refer to current knowledge on
how primate “greeting” calls can be defined and studied (Scheumann, M.; Linn, S.; Zimmermann,
E.: Vocal greeting during mother-infant reunions in a nocturnal primate, the gray mouse lemur
(Microcebus murinus). In: Scientific Reports 7 (2017) 10321 )
6. Line 113: Please give reference for the divergence in the acoustic structure of “greeting” calls
between the four studied species.
7. Methods. 157 ff and Discussion. As one of the former referees mentioned, not the same
methods were applied for all species. This is still the case in the revised MS. Please outline in the
discussion how this situation may have shaped your findings. Further, one of the referees
mentioned that authors did not present any data on the context of an encounter or the quality of
an encounter. This issue remains in the revised MS and thus should be addressed in the
discussion.
8. Line 258. Please outline the concept of Elo-rating here so that the general audience will be well
informed upon the procedure you used here for comparative purposes. To refer to a reference is
not sufficient to understand the content of your paper.
9. Abstract/Results: I still share the opinion of referee 2 that the following findings for
mangabeys are difficult to understand: “low ranking animals were more likely to call than high-
ranking ones” and “calling being negatively associated with rank distance ” (see e.g. Abstract).
Please, address this issue in the discussion to make your findings better understandable for the
general audience.
10. Please check Figure 1, 2 and 5. In my version, I cannot see the description on the y-axis.
14
11. Please address whether all the primary data supporting the findings of the paper are publicly
available.
12. Please give research permission no. in the paragraph Ethics.

Appendix A
We thank the Editor and the Reviewers for their helpful comments. We have
addressed, or responded to, all the comments and suggestions. As a result,
we believe that the manuscript has improved considerably. We provide
detailed responses to particular comments below (in red).
Associate Editor Comments to Author
This is an interesting paper, investigating vocal greeting behaviour in four
species of primates, depending on individual features, dyadic relationships
and audience effects. The authors describe species differences in calling
behaviour. Calling propensity was affected by dominance rank of the focal
individual and dominance relationship between initiator of an interaction
and the target of an interaction. The strength of the relationship between
individuals and audience composition did not affect calling behaviour. Both
reviewers highlight the importance of conducting comparative approaches in
vocal communication, as such the proposed contribution is an important
one, however both reviewers also raise several concerns with the manuscript
in its present form, which need to be addressed prior to publication.
We thank the editor for these encouraging and thoughtful remarks. We
provide point-by-point responses below.
Additionally, to the reviewers’ comments I would also recommend the
authors to briefly summarize the direction of the main results in the abstract,
rather than simply stating that they found an effect.
We have now incorporated a brief summary of the results in the Abstract
(lines 41-44).
Further, the authors selected four study species, based on the similarity in
their socio-ecology as they claim, however as reviewer 1 points out, this
might be an over-statement.
This is a good point. We have removed this part.
In line with this, the authors did not record greeting vocalizations in vervet
monkeys, something which according to the introduction is against the
prediction, as references are provided showing that vervet monkeys do
actually produce vocalisations in interactions. This begs the question why the
authors could not replicate previous finding, and it is probably due to the
lower frequency of encounters recorded for vervet monkey, in comparison
with the frequency of encounters recorded in other species.
The study by Mercier et al (2017) is the only one that studied systematically
greeting calls in vervet monkeys. That study looked at both female-female
and female-male interactions, whereas our study focuses only on female-
female interactions (we only looked at the philopatric sex for reasons
explained below). During encounters females produce grunts exclusively
towards males as shown in Mercier et al 2017, while females do not produce
calls towards other females (lines 335-337). We have now made the
differences between the two studies more explicit in the text (lines 335-337).
As explained below, we provide data only on one sex (the philopatric sex) for
each species because not for all of our study species we have data from both
sexes. The advantage of having data from the philopatric sex (as opposed to
non-philopatric) is that members of this sex can form long-lasting social
bonds, which is not always the case with the non-philopatric sex (mainly due
to frequent migrations of members of this sex, for example in vervets).
Differences in sampling effort between species, both, in regards to frequency
of interactions and also number of individuals observed are a serious concern
as the study claims to compare species and this needs to be addressed prior
to publication.
We appreciate this comment and we agree that compared to the other three
species, we have a smaller number of observations from vervets. While we
agree that ideally the vervet numbers were comparable with those from the
other three species, we believe that these numbers are sufficient to show
that vervets typically do not call when approaching another female (i.e. we
observed no calls during 61 encounters). Therefore, a higher number of data
points from this species would likely not change our conclusions.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
A comparative approach to vocal communication is always welcome but
rarely done. Therefore, this paper looking at greeting calls in the philopatric
sex is a good start. The authors study four species said to be of similar
socioecology, but given that chimpanzees are considered to be a fission-
fusion species and are male philopatric whereas vervets and baboons are
usually classified as having stable cohesive social groups with female
philopatry, can these really be considered similar in socioecology?
We agree that we overgeneralized our statement and we have reworded this
part accordingly.
Furthermore, the title refers to universals in greeting calls but the data do
not support such a strong claim. Vervet monkey females produced no
greeting calls, and low ranking animals called more than high ranking animals
in the other species, but with important species differences. Target animals
called more often in chimpanzees and approaching animals more in the
other two species. Lower ranked animals with greater dyadic rank
differences called more in chimpanzees with the opposite being true in
mangabeys and little difference in baboons. This does not seem like a
universal pattern. If one were to accept that these species all have similar
socioecologies, the main conclusion would appear to be “Diversity in
Greeting Calls”.
We agree and have reworded the title to avoid the problem highlighted by
the reviewer: “Patterns of vocal greeting production in four primate species”.
We have also removed from the text the part relating to socioecology
similarities.
I can appreciate why the authors do not analyze the results for vervet
monkeys since there were no greeting calls, but this species is completely
mossing in the Method sections describing how data were collected. No
mention is made of sampling method or intensity of sampling. Does this
mean that observations on vervet monkeys were casual and not systematic?
Could that explain the lack of greeting calls? More needs to be presented on
methods to assure a reader that strong methods were used on all species.
This is a good point and we thank the reviewer for pointing out this omission.
We now provide the information on how data on vervets were collected in
the Methods (lines 209-216).
Why was focal animal sampling used with baboons and mangabeys but scan
sampling with chimpanzees? Should not similar methods be used for better
comparison?
The core data that were compared across the four species, the encounter
data, were recorded using the same sampling method (focal animals
sampling). Only the methods for establishing friendships differed. For
chimpanzees, for example, we used scan sampling based on proximity scores,
which as an established method for this species and field site. While the data
collection regime differed, the higher-level concepts we assessed can
reasonably be assumed to be measuring the same aspects (e.g. rank
difference, bond strength).
Sex is also a confounding variable in the study. Yes, male chimpanzees are
philopatric, but also have more overt aggressive interactions than female
chimpanzees and females of the other species. If vervet monkeys produce
greeting calls but never among females, then this also suggests a sex
difference in calling in this species. The research seems incomplete without
disentangling possible effects of sex from those of philopatry. The authors
are likely to have gathered data on both sexes as part of their research and
adding those data would make this paper stronger and provide more insights
into the proximate usage and ultimate function of greeting calls.
We very much appreciate this comment. However, we did not systematically
collect focal animal data on both sexes in all four species. Hence,
unfortunately, we are unable to comply with the reviewer’s request. Instead,
we present data on interactions between members of the philopatric sex for
which we have adequate amount of data for each species.
The advantage of looking at the philopatric sex, as opposed to the non-
philopatric sex, is that dominance and affiliative relationships within this sex
are clearly established and easily measurable mainly due to infrequent
migrations of individuals within this sex category.
Regarding the ultimate functions of calls, although we agree with the
Reviewer that this is an interesting research avenue, we would like to point
out that this was not the aim of this study. We have also reworded parts in
the Introduction (lines 130-132) and the Discussion (lines 400-403, 435-437)
to make it clear that exploring ultimate functions of greeting calls was not
our aim. We have also changed the title of the paper, which now also
suggests that we are only concerned with factors mediating vocal greeting
production rather than with the function of calling.
It was also striking that greeting calls appeared so rarely. This raises
questions about their function and usage that the current paper does not
answer. A skeptic might question why it is of interest to pursue research on
greeting calls if they are rare. Is there any evidence of what happens with a
dyadic approach in the absence of greeting calls? If aggression is more likely
or social interactions less likely without greeting calls, then this makes them
of more interest and helps explain their role in social groups. What can the
authors say about social interactions in the absence of greeting? Some
further analysis of the dyadic approach data without any calling already
gathered would be helpful in resolving this.
This is a good point. One reason for the apparent rarity of greeting calls is
that we considered a fairly wide range of scenarios where a greeting could
have happened. That is, we collected data on approaches. Most of these
approaches evidently did not lead to any greeting and interaction and hence
the “rate” appears to be low. But we believe that this is the correct approach
to investigate the factors that drive whether or not a greeting actually occurs
conditional on the occurrence of an approach.
Furthermore, we are sympathetic to the question about the function of
greeting calls, i.e. what consequences do calls have, if they occur, on any
actual subsequent social interaction. But this, as mentioned above, goes
much beyond what this study intended, i.e. looking into the mechanisms of
vocal greeting production. We believe that our aim is now reflected better in
the new title of the paper: “Patterns of vocal greeting production in four
primate species”.
The authors criticize the approach of Laporte et al. which led to different
conclusions about chimpanzees but that study focused on females so the
results may not be directly comparable. The authors would have better
ground for criticizing Laporte if their data on female greeting calls differed
from Laporte et al.
We agree with this statement and mention this possibility in the Discussion
(lines 418-420). However, our criticism of Laporte’s study is actually more
general than that: this study makes claims about audience effects, but
ignores some evidently simpler factors that might account for call
production, i.e. dyadic features and features of the caller. As such, it is less
relevant that this study was done on females. We have amended this section
so that it better illustrates the more general point we want to make here
(lines 412-418).
Table 2 might be more informative if there were also summary lines
excluding he silent vervet monkeys.
Although we appreciate this comment, we believe that providing two sets of
summaries (with and without vervets) could be confusing and not consistent
with the way we present data from the four species elsewhere (e.g. Fig 1).
But we can changes this if the Reviewer or Editor insists.
Figure 5 is missing axis labels.
Thank you for spotting this. We now attach the correct figure.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In the paper „Universals of vocal greeting in four primate species“ the
authors compare vocal greeting behaviour across four different primate
species and discuss species-specific differences in the function of these calls.
The paper is very well written, the introduction is clear, the method section
contains all necessary information’s, the results can be easily followed and I
appreciate the comparative approach.
We thank the reviewer for these positive comments.
In the discussion, I have problems to follow some interpretation of the
results:
1) The authors argue that chimpanzees use the greeting call to signal
submission whereas baboons and mangabeys signal friendly intent but the
authors did not differentiate between the contexts of encounter or present
any data on the quality of encounter. Thus, to make this statement I would
expect that they use context (Agonistic versus affiliative) as an additional
predictor variable in the GLMM model.
We would like to note that investigating the function of greeting calls (e.g.
affiliative versus submissive) was not the aim of this paper since we only
looked at the mechanism mediating the production of these calls. With
regard to the suggestion to include in our models “context” as another
variable, this would be tricky since interactions (whether aggressive or
affiliative) follow rather than precede greetings. We thus believe that
including such pre-defined contexts would not feasible for our analyses and
would invalidate the temporal sequence of events (i.e. context manifests
only after the approach). In addition, it would be difficult to assign a context
to those encounters that are not followed by an interaction. And again,
incorporating the context of calls would be more relevant if we dealt with
their ultimate functions of calls, which however is not the case.
Nonetheless, we agree with the Reviewer that the way we refer in the text to
the function of greeting calls might be confusing. We have now reworded
these parts of the Introduction and the Discussion so as to avoid this
confusion. We now also state in the Introduction (lines 130-132) and the
Discussion (lines 400-403, 435-437) that the purpose of this study was not
exploring the function of greeting calls. For the same reason we have also
amended the title of the paper.
2) In my opinion, the result for mangabeys that low-ranking animals
produce more calls than high-ranking animals (predictor = Elo-rating)
contradicts the finding that high-ranking animals produce more calls to low-
ranking animals (predictor = Elo-rating differences). Do you have an
explanation for that? I was also wondering whether a simple classification in
dominant versus subdominant encounter partner would be better than the
Elo-rating score, which is in my opinion sensitive to the order of encounters.
In Fig. 2 it looks that the calling probability is more affected if the Elo-rating is
negative (larger decrease) than if it is positive (almost no decrease for
positive differences).
We think the first part of this comment is a misunderstanding. Elo-rating
difference quantifies magnitude and sign of a rating difference and as such is
a dyadic feature. For example, an individual with a low rating (and hence a
relatively high probability to call) can still, in addition to this, increase its
calling propensity even more if the approached individual is even lower
rated. As such, there is no contradiction here.
We also refrained from using binary status because Elo-rating provides much
more detailed information and often provides a better approximation of
competitive abilities (e.g. Neumann et al 2018, Anim Behav). Of course the
reviewer is correct in that Elo-rating is dependent on the temporal sequence
of interactions, but this is a design feature of the method and not a
drawback. Using an ordinal ranking method instead would come with its own
set of problems and we chose Elo-rating because it assumes neither
transitivity nor linearity of the dominance network, but instead provides a
cardinal measure of competitive ability that usually correlates closely with
“classic” dominance ranks (Neumann et al 2011, 2018).
3) I further was wondering whether the two predictor variables role and
elo-differences showed an interaction.
There was no significant interaction between these variables. This interaction
was considered in the full model and removed because it was not significant
(table 2). We added a new supplemental figure (figure S1) that shows
graphically the results of the full model. The interaction the reviewer is
interested in is displayed in the second row of this figure.
Thus, low-ranking approach more often than higher-ranking individuals?
This is an interesting question but this was not the aim of this study: we did
not explore variables that explain who is more likely to approach who, but
who is more likely to call when approaching, or being approach, by another
individual. Out of curiosity, we fitted an initial model to address this
question. The results of this model suggest that only for baboons low-rated
individuals are more likely to be approacher compared to high-rated
individuals. For chimpanzees and mangabeys, the opposite seems to be the
case (see attached figure). However, we would like to note here that in
addition to being not directly relevant for our study, this is a very superficial
analysis and almost certainly not the ideal way of addressing the question
with regard to who approaches more often. This is because this analysis is
conditional on an approach having occurred in the first place and hence it is
uninformative about rates (i.e. approaches per time).
Minor comment:
L.170: I was confused that there was no description for vervet monkeys
because the information that they were excluded from the analysis was
mentioned later in the manuscript.
We thank the Reviewer you for spotting this omission. Reviewer 1 also
alerted us about this. We now include the information on how data on
vervets were collected (lines 209-216).
L.176: “Calculate” is a little bit misleading, because the reader expect some
formula. Maybe you can rephrase it or add using the Elo-rating.
We have rephrased this into “establishes”. We don’t provide formulas
because these appear in the cited references in the section that actually
states that we used Elo-rating for assigning dominance scores.
L.250 – 253: This was not clear. How you define interpretable terms? Is it
possible to write until the main terms and significant interactions remained?
When I calculate GLMMs I test the new model against the old model until
there is no significant differences between both models. Did you checked
whether removing terms significantly improved the model?
We are not sure we understand this comment correctly. We defined
interpretable terms (in a model) as “a model with interpretable terms, i.e.,
with significant interaction terms and/or main effects (either significant or
non-significant)” (l. 251f in old version). The crucial aspect for us in this
approach is that this model simplification is conditional on the comparison
between full (i.e. initial) and null model being significant. In this sense, we
compared models by removing interaction terms. To make this clearer, we
added the phrase “using LRTs [likelihood ratio tests]” when describing the
simplification procedure and also added some more references here. We
also wish to point out that the procedure is included in the supplementary R
script and the interested reader can reproduce our steps using the
information presented there. We also included an explicit reference to our
code in this section.
L.286-287: Is there a possibility to have pairwise comparisons for each
species. From Fig 2 the difference for mangabeys looks not very significant to
me.
We apologize for having submitted a wrong figure 2. The correct version is in
the current submission. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we agree
that the mangabey data appear not to be in line with the general trend in
this figure. There are two points related to this. First, symbols in the figure
represent raw data and as such do not necessarily represent the general
pattern once all other variables are controlled for. Second, what the
Reviewer seems to suggest (different slopes for the different species) is akin
to testing the interaction between species and Elo-rating. We have done this
during our model simplification procedure and this interaction term was not
significant and hence removed. The new supplementary figure (figure S1)
illustrated this (in the top row, all slopes are negative for all species and for
both targets and approachers). It therefore seems prudent to conclude that
based on our data the negative effect of Elo-rating on calling probability is a
simple main effect.
L. 310: You wrote that you observed no greeting calls for vervet monkeys
(L.268), but the authors already published a paper about greeting calls in this
species (ref. 11). Do you have an explanation why you did not record these
calls in the present study. Why did you include this species in the paper?
Mercier et al (2017) study looked at both female-female and female-male
interactions while our study focuses only on female-female interactions (we
only looked at the philopatric sex for reasons explained above). While during
encounters females produce grunts predominantly to males as shown in
Mercier et al 2017, females do not produce calls towards other females (lines
335-337) (see table A5 in Mercier et al 2017). We agree this might be
confusing so we have now made the differences between the two studies
more explicit in the text (lines 335-337).
Fig. 1: I would add the vervets even if the mean is zero, then the reader can
extract it on the first look.
We agree. We have amended this figure accordingly.
Fig 2: I was wondering why there are 24 crosses for mangabeys if the authors
observed only 18 individuals.
Thank you for alerting us about this mistake. We now provide the correct
figure.

Appendix B
We thank the Editor and the Reviewers for their useful comments.
We believe we have addressed all the issues raised resulting in a
considerably improved manuscript. Please find our responses
below particular comments.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Claudia Wascher):
Thank you very much for submitting a revised version of your
manuscript. I have now received reports from both original
reviewers and both acknowledge that their previous comments
have been addressed. However, they raise concerns that the focus
has significantly shifted from the first version of the manuscript. I
do not necessarily believe that this made the manuscript
unsuitable for Royal Society Open Science. The journal aims at
publishing manuscripts that are considered scientifically sound
and sufficiently advance scientific knowledge. The judgement as to
importance and significance is left to the individual reader. The
reviewers have confirmed that your contribution is scientifically
sound and I do believe that your manuscript has the potential to
advance scientific knowledge, as the focus on proximate
mechanisms of behaviour is ofter underrepresented. In this
respect I believe your manuscript could make an important
contribution.
Thank you.
I am afraid that at the present stage, the focus of the manuscript is
not entirely clear. I do not recognise what the advantage of a
comparative approach to study mechanisms of vocal greetings, in
comparison to study these aspects in a single species? Did you
have specific predictions that, for some characteristics in their
ecology and/or social system, the species' would respond similar
or different? If you do not have clear predictions with regards to
the species compared, it might be worth to shift the focus away
from it even more.
We appreciate the Editor’s criticism and suggestion. We have
elaborated on the rationale behind our comparative approach (L
87-102). As we outline in the Introduction, our working
hypothesis is that it appears plausible for some greeting
mechanisms to be shared across species while others differ
between species (L 77-87). This leads to the paper being by and
large explorative rather than driven by specific hypotheses, not
the least because we lack very much any prior data for at least two
of the four species (in fact, also our knowledge on olive baboons is
largely based on findings of a closely related species, which we
now make more explicit). Furthermore, we do not know of any
study that incorporated all the variables that we included
simultaneously. In addition to this, we find it challenging to add
predictions at this stage of the study because we now know the
results of our analyses, and this poses an ethical conundrum to us.
Hence, it would be fairly easy to just fall prey to confirmation bias
such that we come up with predictions that are ultimately met.
In your introduction you presently state that studying mechanisms
of behaviour is important and comparing species is important, but
you do not explain to the reader why this is important and what
we can learn from it, e.g. why is it important to understand how
relationships between individuals affect vocal behaviour? You
very specifically describe the details about what you studied, but
you do not explain why this is important, e.g. why the different
levels of analysis matter.
We agree and have added parts in the introduction to highlight
advantages of the comparative approach that we adopt (L 92-102).
You nicely describe what individual species do with regards to
vocal behaviour, but you do not explain what we learn from this
about the importance of the behaviour. Parts of this is already
present in the discussion but it can certainly be highlighted more
in the introduction.
Again, we believe that making the Introduction more hypothesis-
driven is not appropriate for the reasons outlined above. Instead,
we relate our findings to what we know about the greeting
behaviour in the four species in the Discussion. However, as
mentioned above, we have followed the Editor’s suggestion and
elaborated in the Introduction the rationale behind our
comparative approach (L 92-102).
I hope you find the detailed comments made by the reviewers and
my overall comments useful when preparing a revision of your
manuscript.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The original premise of this paper was that among species with
similar socioecology, greeting calls among members of the
philopatric sex would be similar across species. The original
reviews questioned whether the species were in fact similar in
social ecology and noted that there were many differences among
the four species studied. The authors have addressed these
concerns quite well in their revision and now emphasize that their
work focuses mainly on proximate mechanisms rather than on
functional aspects. All of this is quite good and the manuscript now
more accurately reflects what was done and what results were
obtained. However, the points that would have made this an
exciting paper suitable for a Royal Society publication are no
longer present. The current manuscript would make a fine
contribution to a high quality specialized journal on primate
behavior and ecology, but I’m not sure it will have the broad
appeal that is typically looked for by the Royal Society, although I
gather that is not relevant to Open Science. I’ll leave it to the action
editor to make that call.
We thank the Reviewer for its positive comments on the
manuscript. Following the Reviewer’s, but also the Editor’s
comments, we have reconstructed the Introduction a bit to justify
our comparative approach (L 92-102).
Minor Points:
l. 80 use “whereas” or “although” rather than “while”
We have done this (L 75).
l. 120, “whereas” not “while”
We have corrected this (L 129).
l. 226, all animals or just males, since males are the focus.
Thank you for spotting this. We have corrected this (L 234).
l. 247 all animals or all females?
We have corrected this (L 252).
l. 325 define LRT on first mention
The reviewer probably overlooked it, but LRT is defined just prior
to the first use of the abbreviation as likelihood ratio test (L 335).
l. 364 “whereas” not “while”
We have corrected this (L 370).
l. 497 after arguing that the paper is not interested in function,
function is now introduced.
Although the aim of this study is not to investigate the function of
these calls, it is sometimes challenging to present these results
without relating to the function attributed to these calls because
that is what most published findings are concerned with. But we
have made it clear in the Introduction that while we refer to the
function of call, investigating the function of these calls is not the
aim of this paper (L 161-165).
l. 523 can you give some examples of which types of species would
be most fruitful for future research and why?
We agree with the Reviewer and have elaborated on this (L 538-
540).
References: Should not Latin binomials be in italics?
We have amended this.

Comments to the Author(s)
Authors addressed almost all requests of former referees.
Regarding the revision, there were some minors, which I will
outline below.
1. Title. Authors modified the title and the introduction in the
revision to fulfill the requirements of the former referees.
According to my view, the modified title implies that authors will
address proximate mechanisms of vocal production, e.g. neural,
hormonal, genetic, developmental networks or modifications of
the peripheral vocal tract affecting vocal production. However, this
is not what authors have studied in the MS. They studied the
occurrence of vocalizations, given during approach behavior in dyads
of the philopatric sex in a social group of four species of nonhuman
primates and consider thereby the rank of the focal animal, dominance
relationships and social roles within dyads, and audience effects, see
also line 81 ff. It is on the Editor to decide whether the modified title
reflects what authors mean.
We have modified the title of the paper to address the Reviewer’s
concerns and to make it clear that we explore only behavioural
patterns of vocal greeting production (“Behavioural patterns of vocal
greeting production in four primate species”).
2. “Greeting” calls are functionally defined calls. In this MS,
authors term vocalizations, given during approach behavior of a
focal animal “Greeting” calls. The function of these calls, however,
is not yet known for the respective species and according to
authors will not be addressed in this MS. Such a situation makes a
comparison across species tricky since you may compare then
apples with oranges.
We appreciate the Reviewer’s concern. However, in our definition
(in Table 1), “greeting” does not relate to the function of these
calls, but to the situation in which they are produced. “Vocal
greeting: vocal signal given during encounters (i.e., grunts for
baboons and vervets, pant grunts for chimpanzees and grunts or
twitters for sooty mangabeys)”. We however now provide this
definition in the text as well to avoid this confusion (L 68-70).
3. Abstract. Line 36: dominance rank. Do you mean dominance
or rank order?
We now say “individual dominance rank” to avoid the confusion
highlighted by the Reviewer (L 33).
4. In the Abstract, authors use the term “dyadic approach”.
Please address in the methods the link between dyadic approach
and an “encounter”.
We have reworded these parts of the abstract (L 33-43) and the
Methods (L 169-170) to avoid the confusion highlighted by the
Reviewer.
5. Introduction. Line 74. Please embed Scheumannn et al. 2017
to refer to current knowledge on how primate “greeting” calls can
be defined and studied (Scheumann, M.; Linn, S.; Zimmermann, E.:
Vocal greeting during mother-infant reunions in a nocturnal
primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). In:
Scientific Reports 7 (2017) 10321 )
Thank you for this reference – we now cite this work (L 70 and
72).
6. Line 113: Please give reference for the divergence in the
acoustic structure of “greeting” calls between the four studied
species.
We have done this (L 121).
7. Methods. 157 ff and Discussion. As one of the former referees
mentioned, not the same methods were applied for all species.
This is still the case in the revised MS. Please outline in the
discussion how this situation may have shaped your findings.
We appreciate the Reviewer’s comment and now discuss this
particular aspect in the Discussion (L 471-477).
Further, one of the referees mentioned that authors did not
present any data on the context of an encounter or the quality of
an encounter. This issue remains in the revised MS and thus
should be addressed in the discussion.
We now justify in the Discussion why “context” was not included
in our analyses (L 514-523).
8. Line 258. Please outline the concept of Elo-rating here so that
the general audience will be well informed upon the procedure
you used here for comparative purposes. To refer to a reference is
not sufficient to understand the content of your paper.
We have done this (L 263-274).
9. Abstract/Results: I still share the opinion of referee 2 that the
following findings for mangabeys are difficult to understand: “low
ranking animals were more likely to call than high-ranking ones”
and “calling being negatively associated with rank distance ” (see
e.g. Abstract). Please, address this issue in the discussion to make
your findings better understandable for the general audience.
We have now amended this part of the Abstract to make it clear
that dominance status is an individual feature whereas dominance
distance is a dyadic feature (L 33, 36, 42 and 43).
10. Please check Figure 1, 2 and 5. In my version, I cannot see
the description on the y-axis.
We are sorry for this inconvenience. The y-axis labels are correct -
the line numbers are inserted automatically by the Manuscript
Central when uploading the figures. The labels of the y-axis read as
follows: Figure 1 – call proportion; Figure 2 and Figure 5– calling
probability.
11. Please address whether all the primary data supporting the
findings of the paper are publicly available.
We now make this clearer in the Data accessibility section (L 542).
12. Please give research permission no. in the paragraph Ethics.
We have done that for permits that were accompanied by a permit
number.
