Summary
This paper presents a two-dimensional theoretical model that can be used to examine stability
during avian jumping as a bird takes off for flight. Jumping is an interesting and important
behaviour that many animals perform, and is less well-studied compared to other behaviours
such as steady-state locomotion (walking, running, etc). Avian jumping in particular is very
relevant to how birds transition from terrestrial substrates to aerial media, and the manuscript’s
contribution is therefore timely.
General comments
My biggest comment is that the manuscript is not particularly well written, especially in the
Introduction and Theory sections. This detracted from the actual content of the manuscript and
made it more difficult for me to understand what was done and appreciate the methods and
results. Below I give several pointers for how this ought to be remedied, which if done will
greatly improve the manuscript:
1. The Introduction lacks fluency and direction, and reads more like a cursory summary of the
literature rather than building up a logical sequence of statements/arguments. By the time the
reader reaches the end of the Introduction, not only they should have a good grasp of the context
of the study, but also have a solid idea of where the study is heading. (“Ahh, I can see where the
authors are going with this…”) I got to the end of the Introduction and was left wondering what
was to be attempted in the manuscript, or why, or what this study was contributing to the
broader field of animal jumping biomechanics.
2. Also pertaining to the Introduction, whilst it is of course appropriate to summarize relevant
studies, if one is going to do so (to provide the reader with a point of reference), then more
explanation of what those studies did and found is required. A single sentence seldom is enough,
particularly in an interdisciplinary study like this.
3. The Conclusions section is rather lengthy. I arrived at it hoping to have the manuscript’s key
points refreshed for me, but instead had to wade through eight paragraphs. Just focus on the
manuscript’s salient take-home messages; other discussion (including any new ideas) should be
moved to the Discussion section.
4. Certain concepts need to have clear operational definitions provided when they are first
encountered in the manuscript. For example, what exactly is ‘stability’ and ‘neutral stability’ in
the context of this paper? Furthermore, Centre of Pressure and Zero-moment Point seem to be
pretty central to the ideas presented here, and yet it is not clear to the reader (especially if they
are from a biological background) what the distinctions between these concepts are. The first
reviewer of this manuscript’s previous iteration (submitted to a different journal) also had
difficulty on this point, and I do not think that their concerns have yet been sufficiently
addressed.
5. In the Theory section, the development of the theoretical underpinnings of the model is a bit
drawn out. It could be made more concise by, for instance, omitting the examination of the 1-D
jumping model and integrating the salient points/equations here into the planar 2-D model
(which is, after all, what the manuscript ultimately focuses on). With careful explanation I think
all the important concepts introduced in section 2.3 could be presented with a single model. This
would benefit the paper by keeping the reader focused on the system at hand, with no
unnecessary distractions.
3
6. Further to point 5 above, I am also puzzled as to why the development of the theory starts out
with a model with a foot that has mass, and then the manuscript turns towards a model with
massless feet. If the massless foot system is the main subject of the paper, why introduce a
massed-foot model in the first place?
My other main comment revolves around the presence of ‘stuttering’ in some of the model
simulations. The first reviewer of the previous version of the manuscript (submitted to a different
journal) raised concern with the presence of stuttering in the model simulations, and I don’t think
the authors have yet fully addressed this concern. Stuttering behaviour of the kind produced in
the model simulations here is not observed in natural animal jumpers, including the species
whose kinematics are used as the basis for model simulations (guineafowl [Henry et al. 2005] and
doves [Provini et al. 2018]). Animals may perform small preparatory hops in the build-up to a
single, large jump, but these are decent jumps themselves where the feet clearly leave the ground.
In my mind, there is therefore a key point of difference between the model’s behaviour and what
real animals actually do.
The findings from the compliant (‘soft’) ground simulations show that this stuttering behaviour
is, as the authors discussed, likely a consequence of insufficient limb compliance in their current
model. This may be related to too few degrees of freedom in the foot, and so I wonder: If the
model was given an additional joint (or joints) in the foot segment, would this eliminate (or at the
very least markedly reduce) stutter on the firmer ground simulations? If the authors were able to
demonstrate this I think it would improve the robustness of the study, and enhance the
applicability of their work to real biological systems.
Specific comments
- It is poor grammar to begin a sentence with a conjunction (‘and’, ‘but’, etc.). This occurs several
times throughout the manuscript and needs attending to.

- Page 2, line 26: “musculoskeletal” is misspelled.
- Page 2, lines 25-27: “The Mowgli….illustrates the influence of musculoskeletal design…” What
aspects of kinematics or musculoskeletal design in particular were demonstrated/illustrated?
- Page 2, line 31: There should be a semicolon after “jump”, not a comma.
- Page 2, line 53: “…comprise of three…” Omit ‘of’.
- Page 3, line 28: “levels” is missing an ‘S’.
- Page 3, line 39: “can no longer react torques” – is this meant to say “can no longer provide
reaction torques”?

kinematics?
- Page 10, line 52: please provide a brief explanation of what the blade-element aerodynamic

- Page 11, line 36. How were the simulations implemented; what software was used, etc? Also,
the authors should provide their simulation code for others to use and examine their model (in
the supplementary material, for example). The journal is called Royal Society Open Science after
all, and I believe that it is a condition of publication that things like simulation code are made
publically available.
- Page 11, last paragraph of Section 3: except for the first sentence, all of this paragraph is
detailing results, and so should be moved to an appropriate place in the Results section.

- Page 12, third line of the figure caption: missing a closing parenthesis after the reference 37.
- Page 13, lines 12-14: it would be better to be more explicit here to clarify for the reader: this is
the first quantitative estimation of torques (as opposed to direct experimental measurement).
- Page 13, lines 17-23: Perhaps a more complete descriptor here would be how much an effect the
inclusion of wings has on average across the entire duration of the jump, not just at the instance of
peak force/torque. The graphs in Fig. 8 qualitatively show much agreement between the
with/without curves, and I think at present this paragraph isn’t fully emphasizing that fact to the
reader.
- Page 14, line 34: “earlier” not “earliest” – you are comparing two things here, not three or more.
- Figure 4: It and its caption should be self-contained, so the reader isn’t left wondering about any
aspect of it. It would be good to clarify for the reader that the middle green sector in panel c is
overlap between the two stability windows. Also, whilst it is clear how the range of the green
sector in panel c is defined, it is less clear how the yellow sector is defined. You also need to
define what P<sub>TR=0</sub> is. There is also a space missing between the hyphen and the
word ‘and’ in the fourth line of the caption.
- Figure 11: Please use different colours for the different plots to make it easier to distinguish
between them, not just different shades of the same colour.
- Supplementary material videos: these animations are a good addition to the manuscript and
help to illustrate the different model behaviours discussed in the main text. It would be beneficial
if key events during a given sequence (e.g., tipping, stuttering) are actually labelled at the
appropriate times on the videos themselves. Also, in the captions, please give the ‘playback rate’
of the videos, i.e., how much they are slowed down by compared to reality.
- Supplementary material V2: Please specify in the text (not just the caption of Fig. S1) what the
pronumeral k stands for. Also on line 4 there is an omega symbol missing from the left-hand side
of the equation involving the square root.
- Supplementary material V2: caption for Fig. S3, “exaggerated” is spelled incorrectly.
- Supplementary material V2: with regards to the sensitivity analysis of inertial properties, how
was limb segment mass and inertia determined? I may have missed something, but how these
values were derived doesn’t seem to be described either here or in the main text.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This work presents a ZMP-based framework for analyzing dynamic jumping stability for bipeds.
The authors use this framework and a reduced-order mechanics-based math model to explain
aspects of jumping in guinea fowl and perching takeoffs of diamond doves. The guinea fowl
model predicts part of the jumping behavior, but the simulation exhibits a non-biological
"stuttering" takeoff. The diamond dove model predicts foot reaction torques are required to
produce a wide range of stable takeoffs, and the authors claim the first quantification of reaction
torques in avian takeoff. My primary concerns regard the actual predictive power of the models
and clarification of details on the models.
The goal of enabling useful dynamic analysis of dynamic jumping maneuvers using kinematic
measurements is a good one. Further, developing a simplified visualization of stability in the
context of this explosive jumping is something that could potentially be useful for biomechanical
analysis and robotic control. I find the analysis of two separate species and modes of takeoff to
represent an adequate sample to test the validity of this kind of approach. I like the idea of being
able to infer the use of ground torques during perching based on kinematic data. My question is
whether such presented inferences are both non-obvious and reliable.
I have some questions about the degree to which certain observations of the model "confirm"
aspects of the experimental data. If the model control input is joint kinematics, and the foot is
grounded in approximately the same manner as the experimental data, then how insightful or
obvious is it that the resulting body trajectory is similar? My core criticism is that it's not clear to
me how "predictive" this modeling approach really is for these particular observations. Further,
the experimental matching in Figure 11c catches my eye as concerning. Just from a high-level
view, one of the key results of the study is the prediction of foot torques by the perching doves
during takeoff. If the force predictions compared to known data in 11c are not obviously close,
why should I trust the method to predict previously uncharacterized torque phenomena? I would
like to hear the authors' reasoning on this.
"Also predicted are the centres of pressure and stability windows during the acceleration phase,
which are not available from the experimental literature." Is this something that could be
experimentally observed even in principle?
Further, there appears to be a fair bit of reasoning about the modeling results by inspection of the
authors. For instance, the authors gray out data in Figure 9 where t/T_t-off > ~0.7 because
horizontal forces become negative. I understand negative forces being seen as unrealistic, but I
am having problems understanding how the calculation of take-off time is still valid. I'd
appreciate the authors' clarification.
I feel the need for more information and clarification on the math models. Specifically, I would
like to know what, precisely, are the control inputs to this model, and how do they turn into
forces and torques in a multibody simulation to integrate? Do you input the relative angles
between segments as set-points to a joint spring? For instance, sometimes there is foot stiffness
(P11L3) but sometimes it appears there isn't (explaining why lack of compliance leads to rapid
switching in contact points). At a minimum, it might be useful to have a table in the SI that
breaks down the models and what they include and not include. Sometimes I feel lost keeping
up with the changes to the model throughout the manuscript.
6
Based on the description that is actually provided, the numerical simulation methods seem
adequate and the sensitivity checks are welcome. I do wonder why the authors didn't opt to use
to use a variable time-step solver. This might be particularly apt given sometimes there are rapid
switches in dynamics based on contacts being made and broken.
The authors confirm their model's relative insensitivity to leg mass and inertia. This is a nice
verification of their underlying assumptions in this particular context.
How are the kinematic measurements (~50Hz) converted into a much higher control rate for the
simulation (~10 kHz)? If it's some kind of unsmoothed linear interpolation, I could see how jerky
motion would show up in the simulation and create strange stuttering and/or contact breaks
(technically, there would be an infinite jerk kinematic input at every 0.02s interval). This would
be a nice bit of information for the SI to detail.
I note that other reviewers have zeroed in on the "stuttering" behavior as not being particularly
relevant biologically. I happen to agree, and see that the authors have largely tried to frame it
accordingly. I agree that it seems to be a fundamental limitation of a kinematics-based modeling
scheme without compliance.
The title feels a bit overly broad given the comparatively limited scope of the contribution. This
paper provides a kinematics-based analysis tool and framework for jumping stability.
There are a fair number of copy-editing catches which I try to detail below.
Other notes:
P1.L55. This is only reference to energy optimality in the text, and it is in the context of a topic
sentence in the introduction. In this context, it feels out of place with the rest of the manuscript.
Minor catches:
Is the "ziglag" leg meant to be referred to as a "zig-zag" leg?
P2.L9. Unusual punctuation around references
In Permissions section: "priort" appears in multiple sentences.

P5.L35. "But following this a sufficient..." is a bit of an awkward phrasing
P5.L53. unusual parentheses in "initial torque" definition

slipping is impossible in the model?

Editor comments:
I support the recommendation of the AE. I must first say that the rating of one reviewer (accept
with minor revisions) did not reflect the extent and depth of the comments. A "reject/resub"
decision provides more time to revise than the "revision" decision does, so hopefully this will be
of help. The "stuttering" is an issue that the authors are frank about (biologically unrealistic) and
it should be explained a bit more, as well as the overall relevance (verisimilitude) of the model.
Overall I found the writing relatively clear but please pay attention to the minor issues of spelling
and so on. Thanks for submitting.

Your paper has been reviewed by two experts who are positive about the goal of developing a
model to investigate stability in avian jumping, but also raise concerns about the quality and
clarity of the text and the biological relevance of the contribution. In particular, the reviewers
suggest that the authors need to 1) provide clearer text for the background rationale for the model
(including definitions of key terms central to the paper) 2) include sufficient detail on the in the
methods on the maths and signal processing used for the control inputs to the model and 3) fully
address the stuttering issue, which raises concerns about the biological relevance of the
contribution. In light of these criticisms, I cannot accept the paper in its current form. However, I
will consider a revised version that fully addresses the points raised by the reviewers.

This paper presents a two-dimensional theoretical model that can be used to examine stability
during avian jumping as a bird takes off for flight. Jumping is an interesting and important
behaviour that many animals perform, and is less well-studied compared to other behaviours
such as steady-state locomotion (walking, running, etc). Avian jumping in particular is very
relevant to how birds transition from terrestrial substrates to aerial media, and the manuscript’s

General comments
My biggest comment is that the manuscript is not particularly well written, especially in the
Introduction and Theory sections. This detracted from the actual content of the manuscript and
made it more difficult for me to understand what was done and appreciate the methods and
results. Below I give several pointers for how this ought to be remedied, which if done will
greatly improve the manuscript:
1. The Introduction lacks fluency and direction, and reads more like a cursory summary of the

was to be attempted in the manuscript, or why, or what this study was contributing to the
broader field of animal jumping biomechanics.

2. Also pertaining to the Introduction, whilst it is of course appropriate to summarize relevant
studies, if one is going to do so (to provide the reader with a point of reference), then more
explanation of what those studies did and found is required. A single sentence seldom is enough,
particularly in an interdisciplinary study like this.
3. The Conclusions section is rather lengthy. I arrived at it hoping to have the manuscript’s key
points refreshed for me, but instead had to wade through eight paragraphs. Just focus on the
manuscript’s salient take-home messages; other discussion (including any new ideas) should be
moved to the Discussion section.
4. Certain concepts need to have clear operational definitions provided when they are first
encountered in the manuscript. For example, what exactly is ‘stability’ and ‘neutral stability’ in
the context of this paper? Furthermore, Centre of Pressure and Zero-moment Point seem to be
pretty central to the ideas presented here, and yet it is not clear to the reader (especially if they
are from a biological background) what the distinctions between these concepts are. The first
reviewer of this manuscript’s previous iteration (submitted to a different journal) also had
difficulty on this point, and I do not think that their concerns have yet been sufficiently
addressed.
5. In the Theory section, the development of the theoretical underpinnings of the model is a bit
drawn out. It could be made more concise by, for instance, omitting the examination of the 1-D
jumping model and integrating the salient points/equations here into the planar 2-D model
(which is, after all, what the manuscript ultimately focuses on). With careful explanation I think
all the important concepts introduced in section 2.3 could be presented with a single model. This
would benefit the paper by keeping the reader focused on the system at hand, with no
unnecessary distractions.
6. Further to point 5 above, I am also puzzled as to why the development of the theory starts out
with a model with a foot that has mass, and then the manuscript turns towards a model with
massless feet. If the massless foot system is the main subject of the paper, why introduce a
massed-foot model in the first place?
My other main comment revolves around the presence of ‘stuttering’ in some of the model
simulations. The first reviewer of the previous version of the manuscript (submitted to a different
journal) raised concern with the presence of stuttering in the model simulations, and I don’t think
the authors have yet fully addressed this concern. Stuttering behaviour of the kind produced in
the model simulations here is not observed in natural animal jumpers, including the species
whose kinematics are used as the basis for model simulations (guineafowl [Henry et al. 2005] and
doves [Provini et al. 2018]). Animals may perform small preparatory hops in the build-up to a
single, large jump, but these are decent jumps themselves where the feet clearly leave the ground.
In my mind, there is therefore a key point of difference between the model’s behaviour and what
real animals actually do.
The findings from the compliant (‘soft’) ground simulations show that this stuttering behaviour
is, as the authors discussed, likely a consequence of insufficient limb compliance in their current
model. This may be related to too few degrees of freedom in the foot, and so I wonder: If the
model was given an additional joint (or joints) in the foot segment, would this eliminate (or at the
very least markedly reduce) stutter on the firmer ground simulations? If the authors were able to
demonstrate this I think it would improve the robustness of the study, and enhance the
applicability of their work to real biological systems.

me how "predictive" this modeling approach really is for these particular observations. Further,
the experimental matching in Figure 11c catches my eye as concerning. Just from a high-level
view, one of the key results of the study is the prediction of foot torques by the perching doves
during takeoff. If the force predictions compared to known data in 11c are not obviously close,
why should I trust the method to predict previously uncharacterized torque phenomena? I would
like to hear the authors' reasoning on this.
"Also predicted are the centres of pressure and stability windows during the acceleration phase,
which are not available from the experimental literature." Is this something that could be
experimentally observed even in principle?
Further, there appears to be a fair bit of reasoning about the modeling results by inspection of the
authors. For instance, the authors gray out data in Figure 9 where t/T_t-off > ~0.7 because
horizontal forces become negative. I understand negative forces being seen as unrealistic, but I
am having problems understanding how the calculation of take-off time is still valid. I'd
appreciate the authors' clarification.
I feel the need for more information and clarification on the math models. Specifically, I would
like to know what, precisely, are the control inputs to this model, and how do they turn into
forces and torques in a multibody simulation to integrate? Do you input the relative angles
between segments as set-points to a joint spring? For instance, sometimes there is foot stiffness
(P11L3) but sometimes it appears there isn't (explaining why lack of compliance leads to rapid
switching in contact points). At a minimum, it might be useful to have a table in the SI that
12
breaks down the models and what they include and not include. Sometimes I feel lost keeping
up with the changes to the model throughout the manuscript.
Based on the description that is actually provided, the numerical simulation methods seem
adequate and the sensitivity checks are welcome. I do wonder why the authors didn't opt to use
to use a variable time-step solver. This might be particularly apt given sometimes there are rapid
switches in dynamics based on contacts being made and broken.
The authors confirm their model's relative insensitivity to leg mass and inertia. This is a nice
verification of their underlying assumptions in this particular context.
How are the kinematic measurements (~50Hz) converted into a much higher control rate for the
simulation (~10 kHz)? If it's some kind of unsmoothed linear interpolation, I could see how jerky
motion would show up in the simulation and create strange stuttering and/or contact breaks
(technically, there would be an infinite jerk kinematic input at every 0.02s interval). This would
be a nice bit of information for the SI to detail.
I note that other reviewers have zeroed in on the "stuttering" behavior as not being particularly
relevant biologically. I happen to agree, and see that the authors have largely tried to frame it
accordingly. I agree that it seems to be a fundamental limitation of a kinematics-based modeling
scheme without compliance.
The title feels a bit overly broad given the comparatively limited scope of the contribution. This
paper provides a kinematics-based analysis tool and framework for jumping stability.
There are a fair number of copy-editing catches which I try to detail below.
Other notes:
P1.L55. This is only reference to energy optimality in the text, and it is in the context of a topic

I support the recommendation of the AE. I must first say that the rating of one reviewer (accept
with minor revisions) did not reflect the extent and depth of the comments. A "reject/resub"
decision provides more time to revise than the "revision" decision does, so hopefully this will
be of help. The "stuttering" is an issue that the authors are frank about (biologically unrealistic)
and it should be explained a bit more, as well as the overall relevance (verisimilitude) of the
model. Overall I found the writing relatively clear but please pay attention to the minor issues
of spelling and so on. Thanks for submitting.

Your paper has been reviewed by two experts who are positive about the goal of developing a
model to investigate stability in avian jumping, but also raise concerns about the quality and
clarity of the text and the biological relevance of the contribution. In particular, the reviewers
suggest that the authors need to 1) provide clearer text for the background rationale for the
model (including definitions of key terms central to the paper) 2) include sufficient detail on
the in the methods on the maths and signal processing used for the control inputs to the
model and 3) fully address the stuttering issue, which raises concerns about the biological
relevance of the contribution. In light of these criticisms, I cannot accept the paper in its
current form. However, I will consider a revised version that fully addresses the points raised by
the reviewers.

Summary
This paper presents a two-dimensional theoretical model that can be used to
examine stability during avian jumping as a bird takes off for flight. Jumping is an
interesting and important behaviour that many animals perform, and is less well-
studied compared to other behaviours such as steady-state locomotion (walking,
running, etc). Avian jumping in particular is very relevant to how birds transition
from terrestrial substrates to aerial media, and the manuscript’s contribution is
therefore timely.
General comments
My biggest comment is that the manuscript is not particularly well written,
especially in the Introduction and Theory sections. This detracted from the actual
content of the manuscript and made it more difficult for me to understand what
was done and appreciate the methods and results. Below I give several pointers for
how this ought to be remedied, which if done will greatly improve the manuscript:
1. The Introduction lacks fluency and direction, and reads more like a cursory
summary of the literature rather than building up a logical sequence of
statements/arguments. By the time the reader reaches the end of the Introduction,
not only they should have a good grasp of the context of the study, but also have a
solid idea of where the study is heading. (“Ahh, I can see where the authors are
going with this…”) I got to the end of the Introduction and was left wondering what
was to be attempted in the manuscript, or why, or what this study was contributing
to the broader field of animal jumping biomechanics.
We agree that we could have been clearer in our direction through the introduction.
This section has been rewritten with a more logical sequence. The paragraph
summaries are:
Paragraph 1: State the significance of take-off for flight, and the dominance of
legs/jumping in avian take-off (i.e. why we are interested in avian take-off,
particularly jumping take-off)
Paragraph 2: State the two key components of successful take-off: rapid
acceleration and control. Highlight the breadth of literature on acceleration,
particularly in robotics. State the lack of work on control for avian take-off, which
motivates this work. (i.e. why we focus on stability rather than energetics)
Paragraph 3: Introduce and define specific locomotion stability and metrics used
previously
Paragraph 4: Review the use of stability metrics in locomotion, highlighting their
utility for jumping, and propose their use in this work
Paragraph 5: Distinguish between the stability metrics to be used here and those
used for running (which are less applicable to jumping), and also more simplified
ones (recent walking studies)
Paragraph 6: Summarise the objective, method, and outputs of this study.
We have also added an additional statement to the paper summary, which we feel
helps to provide context and motivation for the work:
“The present study concerns understanding how birds retain control of body
attitude and trajectory during take-off. Cursory observation suggests that stability is
achieved with relatively little cost. However, analysis of the problem shows that the
stability margins during jumping are actually very small and that stability
considerations play a significant role in selection of appropriate jumping
kinematics.”
2. Also pertaining to the Introduction, whilst it is of course appropriate to
summarize relevant studies, if one is going to do so (to provide the reader with a
point of reference), then more explanation of what those studies did and found is
required. A single sentence seldom is enough, particularly in an interdisciplinary
study like this.
We agree that more detail of some of the previous works should have been added
to the introduction. For the opening paragraphs that give the motivation for the
study, we feel it is appropriate to refer briefly to other works, as detailed
descriptions would detract from the flow of arguments. However, for last two
paragraphs of the introduction we have added more extensive explanations of the
key papers – including their method and/or findings.
3. The Conclusions section is rather lengthy. I arrived at it hoping to have the
manuscript’s key points refreshed for me, but instead had to wade through eight
paragraphs. Just focus on the manuscript’s salient take-home messages; other
discussion (including any new ideas) should be moved to the Discussion section.
We have reduced down the conclusions section to focus on the key findings. This
section is now 1/3 shorter than in the original submission.
4. Certain concepts need to have clear operational definitions provided when
they are first encountered in the manuscript. For example, what exactly is ‘stability’
and ‘neutral stability’ in the context of this paper? Furthermore, Centre of Pressure
and Zero-moment Point seem to be pretty central to the ideas presented here, and
yet it is not clear to the reader (especially if they are from a biological background)
what the distinctions between these concepts are. The first reviewer of this
manuscript’s previous iteration (submitted to a different journal) also had difficulty
on this point, and I do not think that their concerns have yet been sufficiently
addressed.
We have made the following amendments to the manuscript to include these
definitions:
(p2 footnote): “Here we define stability as the tendency to return to equilibrium
following a disturbance.”
(p3 footnote): “A neutrally stable system does not tend to equilibrium, or deviate
from it, following a disturbance.”
(p2 footnote): “For our purposes the ZMP and CoP are both defined as the point on
the ground plane through which net ground reaction force must pass in order for
there to be zero net moment acting on the overall system.”
5. In the Theory section, the development of the theoretical underpinnings of the
model is a bit drawn out. It could be made more concise by, for instance, omitting
the examination of the 1-D jumping model and integrating the salient
points/equations here into the planar 2-D model (which is, after all, what the
manuscript ultimately focuses on). With careful explanation I think all the important
concepts introduced in section 2.3 could be presented with a single model. This
would benefit the paper by keeping the reader focused on the system at hand, with
no unnecessary distractions.
We recognise the reviewer’s point here and indeed we had considered introducing
all the theory based around the final multi segment model. However, we found that
a lot of the important concepts become very muddled when dealing with the
complex dynamics of the full model. Indeed, we believe that one of the reasons for
confusion in the literature around stability in jumping is a lack of sound precepts on
which to base more complex arguments; hence our motivation to include a primer
section before the main model. To strengthen our case for inclusion of this section,
the first paragraph of the section has been changed to make it clear what the
section is about and what the different models are for:
“2.3 Analytical models of toe-off and tipping stability
This section develops existing theory to provide simple analytical expressions and
context for interrogation of the more complex multi-degree of freedom models
presented later in section 2.4. The models considered here are: 1) a single degree of
freedom model to understand the fundamentals of toe-off, including intermittent
ground contact; 2) a planar dynamic model to understand the dynamics of tipping
during take-off.”
We feel that it is a strength of the manuscript that it introduces the reader to
conceptually simple models of jumping dynamics, and then builds up the level of
complexity and sophistication in a staged manner. While we accept that the 1-D
model isn’t the ultimate goal of the manuscript, we feel that presenting it as a
standalone model simplifies the presentation of the analysis of toe-off, and provides
the reader with a gentler introduction to the more complex subsequent models.
The ambition with the theory section was to introduce and explain the dynamics of
toe-off and tipping using the simplest possible models in each case. The fact that
toe-off is essentially a 1d problem requiring only knowledge of dynamics normal to
the ground plane means that it can be presented using a 1d model with a simplified
leg geometry. Explaining tipping requires the model to be extended to a 2d planar
system, with a 3dof leg, but again with a leg geometry that is simplified in
comparison to a bird leg.
6. Further to point 5 above, I am also puzzled as to why the development of the
theory starts out with a model with a foot that has mass, and then the manuscript
turns towards a model with massless feet. If the massless foot system is the main
subject of the paper, why introduce a massed-foot model in the first place?
We agree that it would more straightforward to begin with the massless leg case.
We have now modified this section of the manuscript to read as follows:
“The single degree of freedom vertical jumping model (Figure 2) consists of a
lumped mass body, m, a massless foot, and a vertically extensible leg of length L
with arbitrary extension kinematics. A similar but more involved analysis can be
conducted for a leg with mass, but we show later that for avian jumping the leg
mass makes little difference to the jumping dynamics.”
Figure 2 1D Toe-off model with vertically extensible leg; 1 translatory degree of
freedom along the y-axis. Mass is concentrated at the body as indicated by the
centre of gravity symbol.
The body centre of gravity is at a height, y, above the ground plane.
From dynamic equilibrium of forces the reaction R at the foot is
<U+0001D445> = <U+0001D45A><U+0001D454> + <U+0001D45A><U+0001D466>¨ , 1
where y is the height of the body centre of gravity above the ground plane, and the
constant g (magnitude of the gravitational acceleration vector) = 9.81ms-2. Take-off
will occur when R=0. The body acceleration condition for take-off is thus
<U+0001D466>¨ = -<U+0001D454> = <U+0001D43F>¨, 2
where we distinguish between <U+0001D466>¨ and <U+0001D43F>¨ so that the model is generalizable to
conditions after toe-off. Equation 2 shows that for a massless leg system toe-off is
governed purely by the vertical acceleration kinematics of the leg. If the foot has
mass then the magnitude of deceleration of the body for take-off will be greater
than 1g .”
My other main comment revolves around the presence of ‘stuttering’ in some of the
model simulations. The first reviewer of the previous version of the manuscript
(submitted to a different journal) raised concern with the presence of stuttering in
the model simulations, and I don’t think the authors have yet fully addressed this
concern. Stuttering behaviour of the kind produced in the model simulations here is
not observed in natural animal jumpers, including the species whose kinematics are
used as the basis for model simulations (guineafowl [Henry et al. 2005] and doves
[Provini et al. 2018]). Animals may perform small preparatory hops in the build-up
to a single, large jump, but these are decent jumps themselves where the feet
clearly leave the ground. In my mind, there is therefore a key point of difference
between the model’s behaviour and what real animals actually do.
We agree that it would be useful to provide further clarification on the biological
relevance of the stuttering that is observed in some of our simulations of the guinea
fowl jump. We do mention in the results (p15) and the conclusions (p18) that
stuttering is not seen in avian jumping take-offs, but we can go further in clarifying
this.
To start with we have added the following sentences in section 2.2 take-off phases
as follows:
“Note that some animals perform a deliberate and sizeable preparatory hop prior to
jumping (35-37), which is typically referred to as a stutter jump (38,39). This
behaviour is not observed in avian take-off. However, we choose to maintain the
use of the word ‘stuttering’ as a more general definition of any intermittent contact
between foot and ground during the acceleration phase of the jump, prior to final
toe-off.”
We have also included the following description within the conclusions to
distinguish between the deliberate preparatory hops seen in some animals (refs 41-
43 in the original manuscript) and the intermittent loss of ground contact in some of
our models:
“With a firm ground model the simulation exhibits a stuttering behaviour with rapid
loss and gain of foot contact. This can be reduced by increasing the compliance of
the ground contact model, or equivalently by introducing joint compliance,
something that has been neglected in this model. Stuttering is not a simulation
artefact, but a physical consequence of the experimental input kinematics giving a
non-uniform acceleration profile that induces strong intermittency in the ground
contact forces. The simulated stuttering illustrates a limitation of using a
kinematically driven model with rigid joints. Despite this, the finding is still
biologically relevant in illustrating the physical conditions that real birds must avoid
in order to prevent premature take-off or unwanted high frequency dynamics that
may affect mechanical control; these same physical conditions are targeted by
animals that do perform deliberate stutter jumps.”
The findings from the compliant (‘soft’) ground simulations show that this stuttering
behaviour is, as the authors discussed, likely a consequence of insufficient limb
compliance in their current model. This may be related to too few degrees of
freedom in the foot, and so I wonder: If the model was given an additional joint (or
joints) in the foot segment, would this eliminate (or at the very least markedly
reduce) stutter on the firmer ground simulations? If the authors were able to
demonstrate this I think it would improve the robustness of the study, and enhance
the applicability of their work to real biological systems.
Following this comment we have conducted trials which model an additional joint in
the foot segment. An additional revolute joint was added halfway along the toe
(halfway between the TMT joint and toe tip). No kinematics data are available for
this joint from the experimental literature. In the first instance we modelled the
joint as being actuated by a weak torsional spring, so as to retain contact between
the distal toe segment and the ground during the leg extension phase, with the
proximal toe segment free to rotate; this makes the distal toe segment the last
segment to leave the ground, as is observed in nature (see figure below). A second
model was developed where this joint was actuated with a motion actuator, so as to
keep in the distal segment of the toe horizontal through the leg extension phase,
with the proximal segment free to rotate. Comparing the results with those in the
manuscript shows that while both new models do see a change in toe-off time, both
still maintain a clear stutter in the middle of the leg extension phase; this can be
seen in graphs in the figure below, as Normalised Vertical Ground Reaction Force
dropping to zero part-way through the jump.
From these results we are confident that the presence of stutter in the model can
be attributed to the input experimental kinematics and lack of model compliance.
To clarify that stutter does not appear to be due an insufficient number of segments
in the foot model, the following statement has been added to the manuscript (p16):
“Preliminary trials were conducted with an additional joint and segment modelled in
the toe, however these models still stuttered during the jump.”
Specific comments
- It is poor grammar to begin a sentence with a conjunction (‘and’, ‘but’, etc.).
This occurs several times throughout the manuscript and needs attending to.
We are confident that avoiding sentences with coordinating conjunctions is a
stylistic preference, rather than a strict grammatical guidance.
We have changed the sentences beginning “But” on pages 1 and 16 to “However”,
while we believe the other sentences beginning with “But” are stylistically
appropriate.
We have changed the sentence in p10 beginning with “And” to read:
“And With no ground contact the airborne leg-body system can translate
horizontally and vertically…”

- Page 2, line 26: “musculoskeletal” is misspelled.
Corrected
- Page 2, lines 25-27: “The Mowgli….illustrates the influence of musculoskeletal
design…” What aspects of kinematics or musculoskeletal design in particular were

Based on the suggestion to rewrite the introduction this sentence has now been
removed, and other information is presented about Mowglil.
- Page 2, line 31: There should be a semicolon after “jump”, not a comma.
Corrected
- Page 2, line 53: “…comprise of three…” Omit ‘of’.
Corrected
- Page 3, line 28: “levels” is missing an ‘S’.
Corrected
- Page 3, line 39: “can no longer react torques” – is this meant to say “can no
longer provide reaction torques”?
Corrected
- Page 4, line 42: “misconception” Please cite examples in the literature where
said misconception has been stated before.
The examples we have of this are anecdotal, from discussions with colleagues and
students, and from our own original misconceptions. We don’t have literature
citations on this. So we have removed this sentence for simplicity, as we think the
point is adequately made even without this.
- Page 5, line 31: “peak value” – peak value of what?
Changed to “the body velocity has passed its peak value”
- Page 5, equation 4: what is T<sub>B</sub>? It is defined in the supplementary
information, but not here in the main text.
The same definition has been added to the main text: “, where TB is the torque
applied to the body, positive anticlockwise).”
- Page 10, line 48: References 13-15 are cited, but do they actually document
anything about wing kinematics?
This was a typographical error. We have amended this to references “44-46”
- Page 10, line 52: please provide a brief explanation of what the blade-element
aerodynamic model is.
The following footnote has been added:
“The blade-element method approximates the 3d wing as a series of 2d aerofoils.
Local wind conditions for each aerofoil are derived from wing kinematics and the
induced flow field. Previous aerodynamic data on avian aerofoils are then used with
the local wind conditions to determine the forces and moments on each aerofoil,
before summing them for the entire wing.”
- Page 11, line 36. How were the simulations implemented; what software was
used, etc?
The following information has been added to the manuscript:
“A multibody computational model of the system was constructed with rigid-body
leg segments and revolute joints, using MapleSim 6.2 (see electronic supplementary
material)”
Also, the authors should provide their simulation code for others to use and
examine their model (in the supplementary material, for example). The journal is
called Royal Society Open Science after all, and I believe that it is a condition of
publication that things like simulation code are made publically available.
A Maplesim model has been uploaded as supplementary material, which can be
used to explore the structure and functionality of the model. As this model is built
using proprietary software and we would prefer to share a non-proprietary model
that is more widely accessible we are in the process of trying to convert this model
to another format (e.g. Modelica) that we can make available.
- Page 11, last paragraph of Section 3: except for the first sentence, all of this
paragraph is detailing results, and so should be moved to an appropriate place in
the Results section.
This paragraph aims to qualify the modelling decisions, with the sensitivity analysis
giving the reader confidence in the validity of the modelling approach. We don’t
regard this information as particular results of the study, but more the trials and
model validation that occurs during the model setup. For this reason we think this
paragraph should remain at the end of the Method section.
- Page 12, third line of the figure caption: missing a closing parenthesis after the
reference 37.
Corrected
- Page 13, lines 12-14: it would be better to be more explicit here to clarify for
the reader: this is the first quantitative estimation of torques (as opposed to direct
experimental measurement).
We have adjusted this to read
“This is the first quantitative estimation of ground reaction torques in avian
jumping.”
We think that this statement appropriately captures the fact that ground reaction
torques have not been estimated from either theoretical models or experiments.
- Page 13, lines 17-23: Perhaps a more complete descriptor here would be how
much an effect the inclusion of wings has <i>on average across the entire duration
of the jump</i>, not just at the instance of peak force/torque. The graphs in Fig. 8
qualitatively show much agreement between the with/without curves, and I think at
present this paragraph isn’t fully emphasizing that fact to the reader.
We agree that we should emphasize more the agreement between these two
curves across the jump duration. The paragraph has been rewritten to address this:
“The wing contributes very little to the mean ground reaction forces and torques for
the most part of the take-off and it may be ignored from a stability point of view.
The greatest influence of the wing on the system dynamics is that it increases the
peak vertical ground reaction force by around 15% just prior to the toes disengaging
(Figure 9b). At this time, the ground reaction torques increase by ~9% if the wing is
included. The magnitudes of these predicted forces and torques contribute to the
body of evidence suggesting that the wing has a secondary influence on the
dynamics of avian jumping (1,2,33). Inclusion of wing aerodynamic forces has a
negligible effect on ground reaction forces and torques (< 1%) and so are omitted
from Figure 9 for clarity.”
We have also adjusted a line in the conclusions to summarise this point:
“and that the wing inertial effects contribute very little to the mean ground reaction
force and torque”
- Page 14, line 34: “earlier” not “earliest” – you are comparing two things here,
not three or more.
Corrected
- Figure 4: It and its caption should be self-contained, so the reader isn’t left
wondering about any aspect of it. It would be good to clarify for the reader that the
middle green sector in panel c is overlap between the two stability windows. Also,
whilst it is clear how the range of the green sector in panel c is defined, it is less
clear how the yellow sector is defined. You also need to define what
P<sub>TR=0</sub> is. There is also a space missing between the hyphen and the
word ‘and’ in the fourth line of the caption.
-The following additions have been made:
“and the overlapping region of these two sectors is illustrated as the dark green
sector.”
“PTR=0 shows the hypothetical location of the centre of pressure for zero inertial
torque (TR=0)”
“The edges of the green sector align with the front and rear of the foot, as shown by
the dotted lines. A similar (but less intuitive) graphical definition of the yellow
stability window is that its edges would align with the front and rear of the foot if
the foot were displaced backwards by a distance equal to the distance between
PTR=0 and P; this has been omitted from the diagram for clarity.”
-The missing space has been added
- Figure 11: Please use different colours for the different plots to make it easier
to distinguish between them, not just different shades of the same colour.
A new version of Figure 11 has been added to the manuscript, using different
colours
- Supplementary material videos: these animations are a good addition to the
manuscript and help to illustrate the different model behaviours discussed in the
main text. It would be beneficial if key events during a given sequence (e.g., tipping,
stuttering) are actually labelled at the appropriate times on the videos themselves.
Also, in the captions, please give the ‘playback rate’ of the videos, i.e., how much
they are slowed down by compared to reality.
We have adjusted the videos to pause at key kinematic events, with labels added to
identify the events.
In the captions for the diamond dove and guinea fowl supplementary videos we
have added the statement “; video playback speed is 1/25 (4%) real time”. We have
not included a playback speed for the simple 1D and planar theoretical models as
they are representative of any scale (and thus could represent a large scale jumper
in real-time, or a small-scale jumper at less than real-time playback speed).
- Supplementary material V2: Please specify in the text (not just the caption of
Fig. S1) what the pronumeral k stands for. Also on line 4 there is an omega symbol
missing from the left-hand side of the equation involving the square root.
The following addition has been made:
“, where m1 is the mass of the upper body, and k is the stiffness of the spring
connecting the two bodies.”
Omega has been added into the equation in question
- Supplementary material V2: caption for Fig. S3, “exaggerated” is spelled
incorrectly.
Corrected
- Supplementary material V2: with regards to the sensitivity analysis of inertial
properties, how was limb segment mass and inertia determined? I may have missed
something, but how these values were derived doesn’t seem to be described either
here or in the main text.
The following has been added:
“Previous experimental measurements of Guinea fowl skeletal elements were used
to define the leg segment centres of mass, radii of gyration, and masses as fractions
of total body mass (54, table 2)”

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_11
This work presents a ZMP-based framework for analyzing dynamic jumping stability
for bipeds. The authors use this framework and a reduced-order mechanics-based
math model to explain aspects of jumping in guinea fowl and perching takeoffs of
diamond doves. The guinea fowl model predicts part of the jumping behavior, but
the simulation exhibits a non-biological "stuttering" takeoff. The diamond dove
model predicts foot reaction torques are required to produce a wide range of stable
takeoffs, and the authors claim the first quantification of reaction torques in avian
takeoff. My primary concerns regard the actual predictive power of the models and
clarification of details on the models.
The goal of enabling useful dynamic analysis of dynamic jumping maneuvers using
kinematic measurements is a good one. Further, developing a simplified
visualization of stability in the context of this explosive jumping is something that
could potentially be useful for biomechanical analysis and robotic control. I find the
analysis of two separate species and modes of takeoff to represent an adequate
sample to test the validity of this kind of approach. I like the idea of being able to
infer the use of ground torques during perching based on kinematic data. My
question is whether such presented inferences are both non-obvious and reliable.
I have some questions about the degree to which certain observations of the model
"confirm" aspects of the experimental data. If the model control input is joint
kinematics, and the foot is grounded in approximately the same manner as the
experimental data, then how insightful or obvious is it that the resulting body
trajectory is similar? My core criticism is that it's not clear to me how "predictive"
this modeling approach really is for these particular observations.
This is a useful point, and something that we discussed at some length during the
work. In our ‘perch model’ the foot is grounded and hence the trajectory of the
body is defined completely by the input leg joint kinematics; as implied by the
comment the model is not predicting the body trajectory here, and hence we don’t
compare the simulated and experimental body trajectories for the Diamond Dove.
In this case the model is predictive in that it computes the perch reaction forces and
torques, and stability bounds.
For the ‘ground model’ of the Guinea Fowl the foot is not grounded, and its
orientation with respect to the ground is a core output from the simulation. The
orientation of the foot, or the way in which it is grounded, is not quantified in the
experimental literature. This is significant as the experimental kinematic data alone
cannot be used to fully reconstruct the jump trajectory. To illustrate this, we include
below a figure of the guinea fowl with the leg extension defined using the
experimental data of joint angles, with the assumption of the foot remaining
grounded.
Hence the model has some predictive power in that it can compute the take-off
trajectory from the input kinematics of the leg segments alone by using dynamics to
solve the orientation of the foot and hence the whole system.
We agree that the specific predictive role of the model could be made clearer in
manuscript. To address this we have added the following to the opening statement
of method section (p10):
“The model is designed to predict ground reactions at the foot for given input limb
kinematics. For perched take-off this allows characterisation of the gripping force
and torque required to achieve a given body trajectory; for ground take-off it allows
evaluation of stability and body trajectory.”
A further comment of the specific ability to predict foot rotation is then added later
in the same section:
“Modelling the rotation of the foot is significant as it changes the orientation of the
entire system with respect to the ground, and hence dictates the jump trajectory.
The foot orientation is not documented in the experimental literature and is
therefore a core predictive output from the model that is necessary to simulate the
jump.”
Further, the experimental matching in Figure 11c catches my eye as concerning. Just
from a high-level view, one of the key results of the study is the prediction of foot
torques by the perching doves during takeoff. If the force predictions compared to
known data in 11c are not obviously close, why should I trust the method to predict
previously uncharacterized torque phenomena? I would like to hear the authors'
reasoning on this.
(For this response we assume the reviewer is referring to vertical ground reaction
forces in figure 11b)
We agree that the less compliant models predict unrealistically large deviations in
ground reaction forces from the experimental data, particularly where there is
contact intermittency in the model. By increasing the ground compliance the
contact intermittency is eliminated, and we feel that the soft ground model makes a
reasonable prediction of forces over the first ~ 40% of the jump, which is the period
where the foot remains in complete contact with the ground (Figure 11b red line).
The predicted forces then deviate from the experiments as the heel loses contact
with the ground.
From this observation we are confident that torque predictions in the perch model
are reliable in the early stages of the jump where there is well defined foot-perch
contact. However, we take caution in the latter stages where the foot disengages
from the perch, and have illustrated this as the greyed out area in Figure 9, and
referred to this in the text; rather than removing this data from the manuscript, we
have chosen to include it for completeness, and to provide transparency in
illustrating one of the model’s limitations.
The following statements have been added to the manuscript to clarify these points:
(p15) “The additional compliance in the soft-ground model eliminates this ground
contact intermittency and allows reasonable prediction of ground reaction force
until t/Tt-off ~ 0.4; after this the simulated forces deviate from the experiments as the
heel loses contact with the ground.”
(p12) “; later it will be shown that the ground model predicts the reaction force
reasonably closely to the experimental measurements when the foot is fully
engaged with the ground.”
"Also predicted are the centres of pressure and stability windows during the
acceleration phase, which are not available from the experimental literature." Is this
something that could be experimentally observed even in principle?
Based on suggestions from another reviewer to make the conclusions more concise,
we have removed this statement from the manuscript.
Further, there appears to be a fair bit of reasoning about the modeling results by
inspection of the authors. For instance, the authors gray out data in Figure 9 where
t/T_t-off > ~0.7 because horizontal forces become negative. I understand negative
forces being seen as unrealistic, but I am having problems understanding how the
calculation of take-off time is still valid. I'd appreciate the authors' clarification.
The take-off time for the perch model of the Diamond Dove (Figure 9) is defined
here as the point at which there is complete loss of contact between the toe and
perch, assessed through visual inspection of the videos in reference (52) of the
original manuscript . The following addition has been made to the manuscript to
clarify this:
(Figure 9 legend) “Results are plotted against time normalised by the toe-off time,
Tt-off, which is defined here as the time in the experiments at which there is
complete loss of contact between the toe and the perch, assessed through visual
inspection of videos”
I feel the need for more information and clarification on the math models.
Specifically, I would like to know what, precisely, are the control inputs to this
model, and how do they turn into forces and torques in a multibody simulation to
integrate? Do you input the relative angles between segments as set-points to a
joint spring? For instance, sometimes there is foot stiffness (P11L3) but sometimes it
appears there isn't (explaining why lack of compliance leads to rapid switching in
contact points). At a minimum, it might be useful to have a table in the SI that
breaks down the models and what they include and not include. Sometimes I feel
lost keeping up with the changes to the model throughout the manuscript.
We agree that we could have been clearer on this. We have made the following
(underlined) additions to the manuscript (p11):
“The control inputs to the model were time histories of the relative angles between
segments.” (see comment below for details on how data are interpolated) . “These
joint angles were input into the software’s inbuilt motion actuators to derive the
necessary torque to drive each joint with the given kinematics. An equivalent model
was trialled using tuned proportional-derivative controllers for each joint with the
joint angles as setpoints; both models produced near-identical jump trajectories,
with differences in take-off trajectory and speed of <0.1° and <0.2%, respectively.”
To clarify the foot-ground contact models, and which models include foot spring
stiffness, the following additions have been made:
(p10) “In the perch-model (Figure 7b) the toes are kinematically constrained to
always remain in contact with the perch.”
(p11) “In the ground model normal ground reaction forces at the toe contact points
were modelled as unilateral critically damped springs”
Results from the ground model also have the spring stiffness values described in the
figure legends (Figures 9 and 10).
Also as suggested a summary table has been added to the supplementary materials,
containing details of models, input kinematics and ground contact conditions
Based on the description that is actually provided, the numerical simulation
methods seem adequate and the sensitivity checks are welcome. I do wonder why
the authors didn't opt to use to use a variable time-step solver. This might be
particularly apt given sometimes there are rapid switches in dynamics based on
contacts being made and broken.
The choice of a fixed step solver enabled a simple, systematic approach to
examining numerical convergence of the solution with reducing timestep size, with
timestep size as the only input parameter. As mentioned on p11, reducing the
timestep size further than the nominal value used in the manuscript led to negligible
change in take-off velocity, giving confidence in the numerical convergence. The
reviewer’s comment on the period of rapid dynamics is important, and so the
following addition has been made to the manuscript, p11:
“… Halving the timestep size yielded <1% change in take-off linear and angular
velocity; <0.5% change was seen in ground reaction force, including during high
frequency dynamic events where the foot-ground contacts were made and broken.”
We previously ran simulations with variable step solvers, but found that defining
both maximum and minimum step sizes, and also error tolerances, was more
cumbersome in examining solution numerical convergence. However, we accept
that a variable step solver can offer potential performance gains by reducing
computational cost during periods of low frequency dynamics. To clarify this the
following statement has been added to the manuscript:
“A variable step numerical integration scheme can be employed to reduce
computational cost for an equivalent degree of accuracy, but for simplicity of
examining numerical convergence a fixed-timestep solver was used in this study.”
The authors confirm their model's relative insensitivity to leg mass and inertia. This
is a nice verification of their underlying assumptions in this particular context.
How are the kinematic measurements (~50Hz) converted into a much higher control
rate for the simulation (~10 kHz)? If it's some kind of unsmoothed linear
interpolation, I could see how jerky motion would show up in the simulation and
create strange stuttering and/or contact breaks (technically, there would be an
infinite jerk kinematic input at every 0.02s interval). This would be a nice bit of
information for the SI to detail.
The joint angular position time histories are interpolated using cubic spline
interpolation of the angular position (p11). So the interpolated angular position is
described by a piecewise 3rd order polynomial, the angular acceleration is piecewise
linear (finite), and the jerk is piecewise constant (finite). The following amendment
has been made to the manuscript (p11) to clarify the method of defining kinematics:
“Leg joint angle kinematics were obtained for the guinea fowl by manually
extracting 15 digitised data points of angular position time histories from (2) and
interpolating these through the jumping time period using cubic spline
interpolation; this gives finite angular acceleration at the joints, which varies
piecewise linearly with time.”
I note that other reviewers have zeroed in on the "stuttering" behavior as not being
particularly relevant biologically. I happen to agree, and see that the authors have
largely tried to frame it accordingly. I agree that it seems to be a fundamental
limitation of a kinematics-based modeling scheme without compliance.
We have indeed highlighted in the paper (results and conclusions sections) that
while stutter is a genuine physical output of the model under the given input
conditions and approximations, it is not what we expect to see in avian jumping.
Note that a comment from another reviewer on clarifying the biological relevance of
the predicted the stuttering the following has been added to section 2.2
“Note that some animals perform a deliberate and sizeable preparatory hop prior to
jumping (35-37), which is typically referred to as a stutter jump (38,39). This
behaviour is not observed in avian take-off. However, we choose to maintain the
use of the word ‘stuttering’ as a more general definition of any intermittent contact
between foot and ground during the acceleration phase of the jump, prior to final
toe-off.”
We then include the following description within the conclusions to distinguish
between the deliberate preparatory hops seen in some animals and the intermittent
loss of ground contact in some of our models:
“With a firm ground model the simulation exhibits a stuttering behaviour with rapid
loss and gain of foot contact. This can be reduced by increasing the compliance of
the ground contact model, or equivalently by introducing joint compliance,
something that has been neglected in this model. Stuttering is not a simulation
artefact, but a physical consequence of the experimental input kinematics giving a
non-uniform acceleration profile that induces strong intermittency in the ground
contact forces. The simulated stuttering illustrates a limitation of using a
kinematically driven model with rigid joints. Despite this, the finding is still
biologically relevant in illustrating the physical conditions that real birds must avoid
in order to prevent premature take-off or unwanted high frequency dynamics that
may affect mechanical control; these same physical conditions are targeted by
animals that do perform deliberate stutter jumps.”
The title feels a bit overly broad given the comparatively limited scope of the
contribution. This paper provides a kinematics-based analysis tool and framework
for jumping stability.
We agree that the title was too broad, and have adjusted it to the following:
“A Dynamics and Stability Framework for Avian Jumping Take-off”
