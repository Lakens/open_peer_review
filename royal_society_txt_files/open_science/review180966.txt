This manuscript investigated adsorption of heavy metals from solutions using biochars from
Eichhornia crassipies. Biochar from was Eichhornia crassipies applied for the first time.
Therefore, it can be published in terms of examining the efficiency of various kinds of biochar.
Also, Biochar from was Eichhornia crassipies showed high removal ability compared to other
biochars. I think this paper can be accepted after following some modifications.
- Physico-chemical properties (proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, etc.) of Eichhornia crassipies
should be given.
- Following 6 recent papers regarding biochar should be cited in Introduction.

This study produced biochars from Long-root Eichhornia crassipes at four temperatures, and
demonstrated its thermodynamics and capacity in heavy metal adsorption. This work present
many results and information about removal proprieties of this new material. It is better if the

authors consider the following mentioned remarks and further improve the manuscript before
submitting the final version.

Recommendation: Minor revisions
comments:
The authors report a serious of experiments by using the “biochars of Eichhornia crassipes” in
adsorbing heavy metals. Generally, it is a good concept by using the natural products into
treatment process. Some parts in the paper should be revised to make it more clearly for reader.
1. Abstract
This statement is unclear: The positive and negative values of <U+0394>H0 and <U+0394>G0 confirmed the
endothermic and spontaneous nature of adsorption.
2. Introduction
Include the following references:

Clean Water Provision Journal of Environmental Management (2017) DOI:

sawdust and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) Water Science & Technology (2014) 70 (8):
1419-1427.
3. Materials and methods
(1)‘Batch adsorption experiments’ part should be before ‘Data analysis’
(2)Replace the word ‘put’ with ‘placed’.
(3) Biochars were produced at 200, 300, 400 and 500
4. Results and discussion
Characterisation of the biochars was adequate and properly interpreted.
(1) there are too many multiple figures (12) and tables (6). The non-essential Tables (like Table 3
)and Figures(from Fig.9 to Fig.12) should be removed and just discussed the results in the peper.
Tables and figures numbers in the text should be changed accordingly.
(2) Contact times of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 seem impractical especially due to error in time measurement.
How to achieve
(3) I think that text should be restructured to understand it more easily, for example discussion of
result should be divised in characterization and evaluation of adsorption proprieties of biochars.
It's confusing, present of same section results of FTIR before and after exposition to toxic metals,
because in this part of text it is not yet present evidences of remotion of toxic metals with
biochairs.
(4) The authors used four kinds of biochars, i.e., LEC200, LEC300, LEC400 and LEC500, to test
their sorption ability on lead, zinc, copper and cadmium.How about LEC600 or LEC700?

We thank the reviewer for this comment very much.

were given in our another published paper.

And the proximate analysis (BET surface area and total pore volume,
pore diameter, Fourier transform infa-red spectroscopy, elemental
analyzer and scanning electron microscope) of the biochars from
Long-root Eichhornia crassipes were showed in Fig.1, Fig.3, Table 2
and Table 3. Uultimate analysis of the biochars was showed in Table.1.

fact, Lagrergren equation is only for first order equation, delete the

In light of reviewer 3# comments:
1. Abstract
This statement is unclear: The positive and negative values of <U+0394>H0 and
<U+0394>G0 confirmed the endothermic and spontaneous nature of adsorption.
Response:
The sentence was revised.
The positive value of the <U+0394>H0 confirmed the adsorption process was
endothermic and the negative value of <U+0394>G0 confirmed the adsorption
process was spontaneous.

Response:

Response:
We thank the reviewer for this comment very much.
‘Batch adsorption experiments’ part was moved before ‘Data analysis’.
(2)Replace the word ‘put’ with ‘placed’.
Response:
Thanks the word ‘put’ was replaced with ‘placed’.
4. Results and discussion
Characterisation of the biochars was adequate and properly
interpreted.
(1) There are too many multiple figures (12) and tables (6). The
non-essential Tables (like Table 3 )and Figures(from Fig.9 to Fig.12)
should be removed and just discussed the results in the peper. Tables
and figures numbers in the text should be changed accordingly.
Response:
Thanks a lot, the non-essential Tables (like Table 3 )and Figures(from
Fig.9 to Fig.12) were moved to the supplementary materials and the
table and figure numbers in the text were changed accordingly.
(2) Contact times of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 seem impractical especially due to
error in time measurement. How to achieve?
Response:
Thanks. Contact times of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 can be achieved through
a automatic sampler.
(3) I think that text should be restructured to understand it more easily,
for example discussion of result should be divised in characterization
and evaluation of adsorption proprieties of biochars. It's confusing,
present of same section results of FTIR before and after exposition to
toxic metals, because in this part of text it is not yet present evidences
of remotion of toxic metals with biochairs.
Response:
Thank you very much, the result and discussion have been divised into
two parts, Characterization of the Biochars and Adsorption
proprieties of biochars.
And the FT-IR spectra can reflected which functional groups can play
a role in binding metals. The results showed that a number of
adsorption peaks had shifted after toxic metal sorption. For LEC200
and LEC300, alkyl, carboxyl, phosphate and cyano groups were
primary sorption sites for lead, zinc, copper and cadmium binding. For
LEC400 and LEC500, there was much change at the peaks of
phosphate and cyano groups, indicating much possibility of adsorption
at these sites.
(4) The authors used four kinds of biochars, i.e., LEC200, LEC300,
LEC400 and LEC500, to test their sorption ability on lead, zinc,
copper and cadmium.How about LEC600 or LEC700?
Response:
Thanks. As we have mentioned in the manuscript, the productivities of
LEC200, LEC300, LEC400 and LEC500 were 73.69%, 49.61%, 43.63%
and 36.99%, respectively. We have tried LEC600 and LEC700, the
productivities were very low. And the biochars were often produced
under 500 oC, low temperature, pyrolysis and anaerobic were the
important characteristics of the biochars which was the significantly
different from the activated carbon.
