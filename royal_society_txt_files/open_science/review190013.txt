Overview:
This is a very interesting concept, applying morphometrics and fluctuating asymmetry in a fairly
novel fashion to study potential impacts of environmental quality of shade coffee and natural
forest on bird communities in SW Ethiopia. The study is novel and has the potential to make a
significant and important contribution to biodiversity conservation in Ethiopia, as well as to
encourage similar studies worldwide to evaluate early indicators of environmental stresses on
populations. On this level, I think it is suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
However, I also have some significant methodological concerns with the manuscript that
I hope can be addressed prior to publication. My biggest concern is regarding sample size and
guild classifications, as best outlined in Table 1. Is it really suitable to compare fluctuating
asymmetry and feather growth bar width of different species, as lumped into very general
guilds? The difference in samples sizes of species between shade coffee and natural forest for
growth bar width measurements seems particularly great. For example the top 4 species were
almost exclusively sampled in shade coffee. Thus how can you compare differences between
habitats??? I’m not sure that lumping them into guilds addresses this underlying issue in the
dataset. If you have a strong argument for why this is valid to compare, I think it should be very
prominently laid out in the methods and discussion. As is, there is really almost no discussion of
such lack of uneven sampling and how that might impact results. Otherwise, perhaps the
analysis should be limited to species that you have a reasonable sample size in both habitat
types…
I also have a bit of a concern with the guild classification for obligate insectivore vs
opportunistic insectivore, which is based on a seemingly arbitrary 80% insect-diet cutoff. Is there
no way to make a more meaningful guild distinction, perhaps based on the classifications in
Buechley et al 2015 (i.e. insectivore / granivore / frugivore).
A couple of other fairly major comments are as follows:
• English was good throughout, up until the discussion, which could use some detailed work
simplifying and correcting grammatical errors.
• Discussion has several bold claims about coffee forests in Ethiopia that I strongly suggest
toning back. This is an interesting study, but I don't think it is definitive enough to say things like
“the negative effects of converting natural forest into shade coffee forests on bird communities
are not dramatic [line 294]”
More detailed points here:
Line 71: “random” – if they are random, then how can they be an index of anything?
Line 78: What about using other bio-markers like mass?
Lines 81-82: “the origin and reservoir” – i take issue with the wording here, as arabica also
originated and is still found in SW Arabia
3
Line 94: tarsis length can be a hard measurement to standardize – perhaps address how this was
done in methods
Line 95: Mass of the retrace? This seems an odd measurement!
Line 97: replace assumed with hypothesized
Line 118: comma spacing
Line 123: has this directly impacted the study sites? If so how?
Line 134: this 80% cutoff seems arbitrary. Could you not find a more well-defined guild
separation, perhaps by following the definitions used in Buechley et al 2015?
Line 143: clarify where the rings are from (i.e. museum of nat hist)
Line 144: is this the only reason?
Table 1: I’m concerned about unbalanced sampling of the study species between habitat types. Is
it valid to compare fluctuating asymmetry / feather growth across species?
Lines 154 – 158: I’m a bit skeptical about this method. Retrix feathers are often soiled by feces.
Were the feathers cleaned prior to weighing? If so, how? Retrix feathers also undergo major wear.
It is not clear to me that tropical birds would necessarily have the same moult pattern, thus
different individuals may be under different levels of feather wear at any given time, which could
impact feather mass. I strongly suggest adding more detail of methods and citations validating
these indices here.
Line 162: “unwearied” – what does this mean??
Line 194: I like that repeatability of the measurements was included in the model
Line 231: spell out acronyms (e.g. FF, DA, etc) at start of new section
Lines 241 – 245: was this caused by scale accuracy? If the scale is accurate, it seems this would be
the easier measurement to replicate. Can you explain this result more, perhaps in Discussion?
Lines 252-254: show p value for this comment
Lines 259 – 260: I would cut this sentence off at “natural forest”. It was shown to support high
richness, including of forest specialists and understory insectivores.
Line 261: I would lead with the significant result (FF with lower growth bar width) and then
follow with null findings.
Line 270-271: “most” – need to add percentage for this claim
Lines 278-279: I would rephrase this sentence away from bold claims
Lines 283 – 284: again, I would back away from this overly-bold claim. I suggest rephrasing to
something like “ our study identified no difference in FA between…”
4
Lines 293 – 294: again, I think an overly bold statement. Your study may add some support to this
idea, but I wouldn’t state that conversion does not have a dramatic impact.

This study aims to assess avian habitat quality between natural forests and shade coffee
plantations in Ethiopia via individual measures of functional asymmetry and feather growth. The
overall aim of the study is excellent and attempts to address an area where much work is needed.
However, I am unable to evaluate the study and thus did not proceed to review the results or
discussion for one major reason.
The paper does not clarify the phenological life history of the 10 study species used. This is
crucial because the measures of local site habitat quality are entirely dependent on the location of
1) where the measured tarsi were developed as nestlings, and 2) where the measured feathers
were grown. For example, if all 10 species were known to breed on site, and it was assumed that
the individuals did not disperse to or from elsewhere, then the tarsus growth could be assumed
to be influenced by the conditions of the study site. However, if the bird was captured after it had
migrated from its breeding location elsewhere onto the study site, then the growth differences of
the tarsus would reflect the habitat quality or conditions of the site where the development took
place. It is worrisome, for example, that juveniles were not included in the study even though
these would be an example of individuals for which tarsi development location would have been
known. Similarly, it is not clarified where the rectrices feather growth took place and this is
typically different depending on species and age. In first year birds, the rectrices would have
grown in on the breeding grounds. If the captured birds were after-first-year adults, the rectrices
might have molted in during different time periods and at different locations depending on the
5
species. If this information is unknown then the only way to know for certain that a feather was
grown at the study site would be to pluck the feather of unknown origin and then pluck the
regrown feather from the recaptured bird. Thus the feather growth rate would reflect conditions
at that specific site and not the location where the original plucked feather was grown.
It is my assumption that this information was taken into account and it is known but simply not
reported. For example, it could be that the ten species are known to breed (and thus develop
their tarsi) on site. It could be that the species are migrants from another breeding site but they
moult rectrices during the time period in which they are captured on site, or they are year round
residents and thus perform their moulting cycles on site (and do not move between the forest and
shade coffee). I am happy to review the paper again if this is the case. However, if this type of
information is unavailable then I am afraid it is impossible to know whether the tarsi and feather
measures reflect what the authors assume they reflect.
I have made other less crucial comments in-text of the pdf that should also be addressed if
revised (Appendix A).

I am happy to once again review this paper which aims to compare avian habitat quality between
shade coffee and nearby natural forests in Ethiopia. The paper is an important contribution in
that unlike most studies of this sort, it aims to compare biomarkers rather than community
measures. Both approaches are important, but as the authors note, occupancy alone is not always
the best measure of habitat quality.
This version and the author responses addressed my major concern from my previous review. I
10
also agreed with the primary comment of the 2nd reviewer that it is more appropriate to compare
these biomarkers between habitat types within the same species, rather than between guilds. The
reworked paper is much more sound, though I recommend that a major revision is still needed. I
think that all of the pieces are here (in terms of the data, the design, and the statistical analysis) to
present a simple but important result, but I am afraid that the grammar and writing make the
story more complicated than it needs to be.
I think it would be very helpful for the authors to request assistance from a copy editor. I am very
familiar with the general topic of the paper, thus with some effort I was able to decipher what the
paper was explicitly attempting to convey. I fear that readers less familiar with the topic will not
be able to do so. I provided a few comments and suggestions for sentences where I found this to
be especially true, but I would recommend a thorough check on both grammar and sentence
structure so that the primary message is conveyed more clearly.
I am not familiar with the details of analysis of FA, but I think that too much detail of this
analysis is provided in the results section. The main aim of the paper is to compare habitat
quality (via biomarkers) between the two habitat types; I suggest leading the results section with
this result. As it currently stands, this main result is not addressed until the end of the second
paragraph.
In reference to a comment from my previous review, the authors stated that they addressed this
in the discussion, however this version does not contain any mention of this in the discussion. I
actually suggest that this instead be briefly addressed in the methods instead. The original
comment was: “No need to go into an exhaustive review of these two measures, but since the
entire study is based on FA and feather growth, it would help the reader to have a bit more
justification for the validity of the methods. Please more explicitly explain the links between FA
and Feather Growth to fundamental life history components. Also, what do you think about the
criticisms of ptilochronology? (for example, see citations below). Again, no need for too much
detail but please add in a few more clarifying sentences to make the life history links and very
briefly address the criticisms of Murphy.
Murphy and King. 1991. Ptilochronology: a critical evaluation of assumptions and utility. The
Auk 108:695-704
Murphy. 1992. Ptilochronology: accuracy and reliability of the technique. The Auk 109:676-680.”
Finally, I see that the paper does link to the Dryad Digital Repository. However, this is done in
the literature cited section and I just happened to run across it. I don't believe the citation (#77) is
referred to anywhere in the text. This is the reason that I checked "no" for the two questions
pertaining to the accessibility of the supporting data. I recommend making this link more clear by
adding it as a supplement or mentioning it in the acknowledgements.
I am happy to review this paper again (see Appendix C).

entire study is based on FA and feather growth, it would help the reader to have a bit more
justification for the validity of the methods. Please more explicitly explain the links between FA
and Feather Growth to fundamental life history components. Also, what do you think about the
criticisms of ptilochronology? (for example, see citations below). Again, no need for too much
detail but please add in a few more clarifying sentences to make the life history links and very
briefly address the criticisms of Murphy.
Murphy and King. 1991. Ptilochronology: a critical evaluation of assumptions and utility. The
Auk 108:695-704
Murphy. 1992. Ptilochronology: accuracy and reliability of the technique. The Auk 109:676-680.”
Finally, I see that the paper does link to the Dryad Digital Repository. However, this is done in
the literature cited section and I just happened to run across it. I don't believe the citation (#77) is
referred to anywhere in the text. This is the reason that I checked "no" for the two questions
pertaining to the accessibility of the supporting data. I recommend making this link more clear by
adding it as a supplement or mentioning it in the acknowledgements.
I am happy to review this paper again.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
This is an interesting study that uses fluctuating asymmetry (tarsus and tail feathers) and feather
growth rates (ptilochronology) as biomarkers to compare birds breeding in shade coffee
plantations vs native wet forests in the mountains of Ethiopia.
The topic is of general interest in that it may provide insight into whether habitat quality is
equivalent between agroforestry versus native forests; not just that the species are retained in
shade coffee plantations but that they are still able to sufficiently breed and not be sink
populations.
While I like the idea of this study, I have a couple of comments that I think the authors would
have to address in order to convince readers of the effectiveness of their technique.
1. Validation of the Biomarkers
The first of these comments is regarding the “ground truthing” of these two biomarkers – while
there are studies to suggest that both Fluctuating Asymmetry and Ptilochronology can be reliably
associated with measures of individual condition, there are also studies that have failed to make
these connections. In the current study, there is no independent measure of condition to which
the measures of FA or Tail Growth are compared so as to show they can accurately be used as
biomarkers. This assumption, though, is the basis for the entire study (L104-107) and
recommendation for further use in other studies (L319-321). I suspect that the authors do not
have data on reproductive success or other measures of condition that they can correlate
asymmetry or tail-growth measures to, but at the very least they could compare these measure to
one another.
The use of the two biomarkers in tandem, as suggested (L84-86, L303-305), would indicate they
show the same pattern. As a result, there should be a strong negative correlation between level of
asymmetry and tail feather growth bar width (little asymmetry should correspond to large
growth bars, and high asymmetry with small growth bars). If the authors could show this
association, it would help validate these as potentially sensitive biomarkers of condition.
2. Ptilochronology Measure
The authors have measured growth bands on tail feathers plucked from birds at initial capture.
While they have definitely refined on Grubb’s technique (e.g. digital vs manual measurement of
individual vs groups of growth bars – L181-182 – and repeatability studies on measures that
show remarkably high confidence in measurement –L191-194), there are still problems with
measuring growth rates in feathers in this manner. First, as the authors indicate, feathers are
moulted throughout adult life, so represent a snapshot of condition/food availability in the
habitat during the time period of regrowth (L110-112). However, there is no indication in this
study if all the birds from which feathers were drawn are of the same relative age (all adults, no
juveniles) to suggest they all moulted their feathers during the same time period. Although the
authors indicate all species are resident breeders in the region (L144), they don’t indication
whether they are year-round residents on the exact territories in which they were captured
during these studies, or whether they may have been occupying different areas during the period
of feather regrowth. Without this information, you don’t have a firm basis to conclude that
feather growth bars reflect growth in the habitats in which the birds are currently located. If
shade coffee sites are sink populations, you could be measuring birds that grew their feathers in
forested areas, then dispersed to shade coffee sites.
The advocated technique in ptilochronology studies by Grubb is to pluck feathers from the birds
to induce regrowth, then recapture the birds and pluck the regrown feathers for measurement.
This standardizes both the temporal period in which the feathers are regrown, as well as confirms
they are regrown in the habitat the bird is currently occupying. I suspect this is not possible in the
current study, but the limitation of the technique you have used needs to be addressed and also
highlighted as a possible source of not detecting differences (e.g. L 267-268).
16
3. Native Forest and Shade Coffee sites being of “similar quality”
This is the conclusion that is drawn by the authors not finding differences in FA or Tail Growth
bars (L289). First, I think you need to account for the validity of your biomarkers and limitations
of your ptilochronology technique (above two points), but even then I would argue that your
results hint that this is a false conclusion to draw. While not statistically significant, the FA data
does show a pretty consistent pattern across 4 of the 5 species that there was slightly higher FA in
the shade coffee sites than natural forest sites (Figure 2a). Only one species with extremely
variable tarsal FA (Grey-backed Camaroptera) doesn’t show this pattern, and two of the other
species have suggestive P values in the 0.1 range. As you are using a proxy of condition, rather
than a direct measure of condition, I would suggest you are a little more cautious. While you
can’t statistically conclude there is a difference, it doesn’t mean the two habitats are necessarily
equivalent.

The authors have addressed some of my initial concerns - for example they have confirmed that
individual birds captured as juveniles were recaptured in subsequent years in the same locations,
indicating that the biomarkers they measure (tarsal asymmetry reflecting nestling growth
conditions, tail asymmetry reflecting stress on adults, and feather growth rates indicative of food
availability) are accurately reflecting the conditions under the two habitats they are testing.
They have not addressed my other concern - the validation of the biomarkers themselves. In
their reply, they indicate they simply assume these markers are sensitive based on other studies.
This is sufficient so long as they explicitly acknowledge this in the manuscript, but I also
suggested a simple means of verifying this through a quick correlation between the markers to
look for a negative association. The authors appear to have attempted this (Reply letter) with a
bivariate pearson correlation, with the results being in the correct direction but not significant.
While they indicate this appears in the paper, the line numbers they refer to don't include this
analysis, nor did I find it mentioned in the entire paper.
Despite this, the authors have qualified a bit of their language in the revised manuscript to
acknowledge a bit more uncertainty of their results, particularly as their results failed to show an
difference in bioindicators between samples from either habitat where others have found such
differences (Buechley et al. 2015, L298).
However, without this validation, I feel that the paragraph (L315-323) recommending "future
studies combine the use of both biomarkers to robustly asses the habitat quality" is overstated.
This advocation is problematic when you yourselves have assumed these are robust measures
without actually testing or demonstrating this. I suggest simply omitting this paragraph.
L290-294. Sentences are poorly constructed. I would suggest something like:
"As individual birds were initially banded as juveniles, and subsequently recaptured in later
years as adults in the same sites, this suggests our biomarker measures (tarsal and retrice
asymmetry and feather growth rates) should reflect conditions faced within our two specific
regions - shade coffee vs natural forests".
I would also suggest this would probably be better to put into the Methods than leave to the
Discussion.

I am satisfied that with the author's response to my final comments.
The only outstanding suggestion would be wording of their concluding sentence:
L325-330 - change to:
The lack of strong correlation between the growth bar width and FA tarsus length mean
the biomarkers used in this study are not equally sensitive for assessing the effects of
habitat change. Only a few studies have combined FA and feather growth bar width
analysis as biomarkers of habitat fragmentation; in some of these, the two markers both both
varied with habitat quality, but in others only one of the two markers showed an effect of
fragmentation. We recommend future studies combine the use of multiple biomarkers when
assessing changes to the habitat quality following habitat conversion."

Comments to the Author(s)
I am satisfied that with the author's response to my final comments.
The only outstanding suggestion would be wording of their concluding sentence:
L325-330 - change to:
The lack of strong correlation between the growth bar width and FA tarsus length mean
the biomarkers used in this study are not equally sensitive for assessing the effects of
habitat change. Only a few studies have combined FA and feather growth bar width
26
analysis as biomarkers of habitat fragmentation; in some of these, the two markers both both
varied with habitat quality, but in others only one of the two markers showed an effect of
fragmentation. We recommend future studies combine the use of multiple biomarkers when
assessing changes to the habitat quality following habitat conversion."

10
11
12
20 Shade coffee farming has been promoted as a means for combining sustainable use of forests
13
14 21 and biodiversity conservation, mainly because in shade coffee forests and natural forests a
15
16 22 similar diversity and abundance of, e.g. birds, have been found. However, since negative
17
18 23 effects on such indicators for habitat quality may become obvious only after some time,
19
20 24 because of constant influx of birds from nearby subpopulations in natural forests, other
21
22 25 indicators for habitat quality of shade coffee forests should also be applied. We used two
23
24
25
26 biomarkers, fluctuating asymmetry of tarsus length (FA) and feather growth rate (relative
26
27 27 growth bar width), assuming higher FA and narrower feather growth bars in shade coffee
28
29 28 forest than in natural forest. We measured and compared more than 350 birds of four
30
31 29 functional guilds (forest specialist and generalist, as well as obligate and opportunistic
32
33 30 insectivores) from both forest types. The extent of FA showed no difference between the two
34
35 31 forest types in any of the four guilds. Similarly, no difference was found in growth bar widths
36
37
32 in any of these guilds with the exception of forest specialist birds, which had narrower growth
38
39
40 33 bars in shade coffee forests than in natural forests. This suggests that shade coffee forests
41
42 34 constitute a habitat lower value for this guild. From our results we conclude that although
43
44 35 shade coffee farming seems to have little negative effects on most bird species (guilds), the
45
46 36 promotion of this agro-forestry practice should not lead to more conversion of natural forest
47
48 37 into shade coffee forest, but to support conversion of degraded forests into shade coffee
49
50
38 forests.

3 41 1. Introduction
4
5 42 Tropical forests host at least two-thirds of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity and offer a wide
6
7 43 range of ecosystem services [1]. However, these forests are shrinking at unprecedented rates
8
9 44 [2,3]. Agricultural practices compatible with forest conservation have been proposed as a
10
11
12
45 potential strategy to slow down, stop or even reverse the current alarming rate of
13
14 46 deforestation [4].
15
16 47 Shade coffee farming, i.e. growing coffee beneath the canopy of shade trees, has
17
18 48 recently gained support as a form of agricultural practice that is, at least partly, more
19
20 49 compatible with biodiversity conservation than other agricultural practices [5-7]. For instance,
21
22 50 shade coffee farming seems to have no negative effects on species richness, abundance and
23
24
25
51 community composition as compared to natural forests (8-10). Therefore, it was concluded,
26
27 52 that shade coffee farming can play an important role when combining biodiversity
28
29 53 conservation and agro-forestry [10-12].
30
31 54 Such inference implicitly assumes that populations inhabiting shade coffee forests also
32
33 55 share equal prospects of long-term survival or/and reproduction with conspecifics residing in
34
35 56 pristine forest [13,14]. However, demographic changes in the distribution of sex or age
36
37
57 classes, changes in rates of survival or reproduction, which results from biotic changes, are
38
39
40 58 possibly long term effects which are unlikely to be picked up by community-level studies on
41
42 59 demography and a-diversity alone, if surveys are done shortly after the changes happened.
43
44 60 Populations can be affected without any noticeable change in diversity and demography due
45
46 61 to time lags in responses or immigration from nearby source populations [15,16]. To
47
48 62 overcome problems of demography based studies, a growing number of studies applied
49
50
63 phenotypic or physiological proxies of fitness (biomarkers), such as body size, body mass,
51
52
53 64 fat-free mass, or the rate or precision of growth, which are all thought to be able to indicate
54
55 65 stress (e.g. nutritional stress), and thus lower habitat quality. Lower habitat quality in turn,
56

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 4 of 29
1
2
3 66 will have negative effects on respective populations in the long run [17,18]. Stress-mediated
4
5 67 changes should preferably be detectable before direct components of fitness are compromised
6
7 68 (see [19] for a list of criteria to evaluate biomarkers) and, within conservation contexts,
8
9 69 collecting respective data should not involve lethal sampling, exhaustive training or
10
11
12
70 expensive equipment.
13
14 71 Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), i.e. small random deviations from left-right symmetry in
15
16 72 bilateral traits [20-23], and feather growth rate, measured as the width of alternating dark and
17
18 73 light growth-bars on bird feathers [ptilochronology, 24-27], fulfil the above criteria. The
19
20 74 benefits of these markers are based on their ease, low cost, and non-lethality of measurement
21
22 75 and their link to fundamental life-history components that are otherwise more laborious to
23
24
25
76 measure [28]. When applied in tandem [29,30], they provide an overall, integrated picture of
26
27 77 environmental and nutritional stress effects [17], which in turn can provide information on
28
29 78 habitat quality.
30
31 79 Ethiopian coffee mainly grows in tropical rain forest remnants belonging to the Eastern
32
33 80 Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. This hotspot is known for its exceptionally high level of
34
35 81 biodiversity and endemicity [31]. The respective forests are also the origin and reservoir of
36
37
82 wild Coffea arabica [32,33]. Buechley et al. [34] showed that bird diversity in shade coffee
38
39
40 83 forests in SW Ethiopia did not significantly differ from that of ecologically comparable
41
42 84 natural moist evergreen Afromontane forests in the same region. The forests used for coffee
43
44 85 production even hosted over more than twice the number of species of the latter. While all
45
46 86 bird species recorded in primary forest control sites were also recorded in shade coffee forests,
47
48 87 shade coffee plots, however, showed a lower abundance of forest specialists and understorey
49
50
88 insectivores. The authors therefore concluded that, while Ethiopian shade coffee farming is
51
52
53 89 perhaps the most “bird-friendly” coffee in the world, little-disturbed forest remains critical
54
55 90 for sustaining at-risk groups of birds, such as forest specialist birds [34].

3 91 To determine whether populations of forest-dependent species that currently persist in
4
5 92 Ethiopian shade coffee farms show signs of increased environmental and/or nutritional stress
6
7 93 compared to conspecifics from natural forests, we revisited a subset of the study plots
8
9 94 sampled by Buechley et al. [34] and measured FA of two phenotypic traits (length of tarsi
10
11
12
95 and mass of the second outermost rectrices) and feather growth rates of the second outermost
13
14 96 rectrices in 380 individual birds belonging to ten species. If shade coffee farming has
15
16 97 negative effects on bird communities, we assumed to find higher FA and lower feather
17
18 98 growth rates (i.e., narrower feather growth bars) in birds from shade coffee forests as
19
20 99 compared to birds from undisturbed forests. Studying both traits allowed us to assess possible
21
22 100 adverse effects of shade coffee farming during subsequent life stages, because tarsi are
23
24
25
101 already fully grown before fledging, thus providing information on stress during the nestling
26
27 102 period [35,36], while rectrices are moulted throughout adult life, providing information on
28
29 103 stress in later phases of the individuals’ life-history.

33 105 2. Materials and method
34
35 106 2.1 Study site
36
37
107 The study was conducted in south-western Ethiopia at three sites in shade coffee farming area
38
39
40 108 (422 km2): Fetche, Garuke, and Yebu, and at four natural forest sites in the Belete-Gera
41
42 109 Forest (920 km2): Afalo, Abana Buna, Qacho, and Muje (Fig. 1).
43
44 110 In the shade coffee production scheme, the forest was modified from the original forest
45
46 111 to improve the productivity of coffee plants by reducing tree and shrub density. This leads to
47
48 112 obvious differences in the vegetation density and canopy cover compared to the natural
49
50
113 forest. In the shade coffee areas seedling density, stem density and crown cover of indigenous
51
52
53 114 trees were 3000 ha-1, 655 ha-1 and 79%, respectively, whereas in natural forests respective
54
55 115 numbers were 10,000 ha-1, 952 ha-1 and 86.7% [37].

3 116 The Belete-Gera Forest is one of the largest remaining tracts of forest in south-western
4
5 117 Ethiopia. It is a typical Afromontane evergreen forest, dominated by tree species like
6
7 118 Syzigium guineense, Olea welwitchii, Prunus africana and Pouteria adolfi-friederici , with
8
9 119 over 157 plant species representing 69 families and 135 genera [38,39]. Its animal diversity
10
11
12
120 has never been thoroughly studied, but during a one month pilot study, 25 mammal, 16
13
14 121 amphibian, 5 reptile, 126 bird and 87 butterfly species have been identified [40]. The forest is
15
16 122 considered as a regional forest priority area and “Key Biodiversity Area” (KBA). Regardless
17
18 123 of this, deforestation and habitat modification continues in the region.
19
20 124
21
22 125 2.2 Study species
23
24
25
126 We focussed our study on ten bird species (Table 1). We were not able to compare respective
26
27 127 biomarkers in each species separately, because for several species we failed to collect data in
28
29 128 one of the two forest types (Tab. 1). Therefore, and since Buechley et al., [34] already
30
31 129 showed that the abundance of birds of the forest-specialist-guild was negatively affected by
32
33 130 shade coffee farming, we also assigned our study species according to ecological properties
34
35 131 into four functional guilds. Each species was assigned to two of four functional guilds based
36
37
132 on their predominant habitat utilization (forest specialist versus forest generalist [41-47]) and
38
39
40 133 the proportion of invertebrates in their diet (obligate insectivore species OBI, with a diet
41
42 134 comprising of = 80% invertebrates and opportunistic insectivore species OPI, with < 80%
43
44 135 invertebrate diet based on Elton Trait database (Table 1, [48]).
45
46 136
47
48 137 2.3 Data collection
49
50
138 From December 2013 to June 2015, we captured 488 birds belonging to ten species using
51
52
53 139 standardized mist-nets. We opened the nets 30 minutes before sunrise and kept them open for
54
55 140 six hours. We controlled the nets routinely at 30-min intervals to remove birds without

3 141 holding them too long. We released the birds immediately after we collected feather samples
4
5 142 and took the measurements on the spot. Juvenile birds were released immediately without
6
7 143 taking any measurement. We ringed the birds with Kenyan rings to recognize them in case
8
9 144 they were caught a second time.
10
11
12
145
13
14 146 2.3.1 Measurement of tarsi length and rectrix mass
15
16 147 Fluctuating asymmetry was determined from two traits, tarsi length and rectrix mass.
17
18 148 Different traits have different susceptibility for FA based on cost of growth of the trait,
19
20 149 defined as the amount of structural components necessary to form a unit of length of a given
21
22 150 character [49] hence we used both traits. Tarsi length, distance from the back of inter-tarsal
23
24
25
151 joint to the point where the toes bending an angle of 90 degree to the tarsus [50], was
26
27 152 measured in the field to the nearest 0.1 mm using slide callipers. Two independent
28
29 153 measurements of right and left tarsus lengths for each individual (sequence right-left-right-
30
31 154 left or left-right-left-right) were taken. Second outer most, (the fifth) right and left rectri
32
33 155 (fully-grown) feathers were collected from every bird captured for rectrix mass
34
35 156 measurements [29]. The feathers were stored dry in paper envelopes and transported to the
36
37
157 laboratory, and the rectrices were measured with a calliper and weighted twice using an
38
39
40 158 analytical balance to the nearest 0.1 mg.
41
42 159
43
44 160 2.3.2 Measurement of growth bar widths
45
46 161 Growth bar widths and total feather lengths were measured by one of us (GG) as follow: (1)
47
48 162 each unwearied feather was pinned on separate, white, polystyrene boards and total feather
49
50
163 length was measured to the nearest 0.01 mm with a digital calliper. (2) Each feather was
51
52
53 164 marked at a distance of 7/10 from its proximal end, and the proximate and distal ends of 5
54
55 165 consecutive growth bars were marked with ultrafine mounting pins. (3) Each marked board

2
3 166 was scanned (Oce OP1130) and growth bar widths and total feather lengths were
4
5 167 automatically measured with an image-analysis-software (KS400 Zeiss). The entire
6
7 168 procedure was repeated for 66 randomly selected feathers to assess the repeatability of our
8
9 169 measurements.
10
11
12
170
13
14 171 2.4 Data validation
15
16 172 Possible data outliers were identified using Proc Univariate procedure (in SAS) to ensure
17
18 173 data quality for all measurements (tarsus length, feather mass, feather length and average
19
20 174 growth bar widths), whereby lower and higher extreme observation values were screened out
21
22 175 from the data.
23
24
25
176 The level of repeatability for the growth bar widths was calculated according to Lessells
26
27 177 and Boag [51], whereby within-group and between group mean squares were obtained from
28
29 178 1-way ANOVAs, and the p-values were obtained from F-tests. Repeatability estimates were
30
31 179 high, both for total feather length (right trait side: r = 0.999, N = 66, P = <0.001; left trait side:
32
33 180 r = 0.999, N = 66, P < 0.001) and for average growth bar widths (right trait side: r = 0.992, N
34
35 181 = 66, P < 0.000; left trait side: r = 0.983, N = 66, P < 0.001).
36
37
182 Since the data of the measured traits (unsigned FA values for tarsus length and rectrix
38
39
40 183 mass, average growth bar widths and total feather lengths) deviated from respective normal
41
42 184 distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; see Table S1), we log-transformed the data to meet
43
44 185 normality assumptions before further analysis.
45

47
48 187 2.5 Data analyses
49
50
188 2.5.1 Analysis of fluctuating asymmetry
51
52
53 189 Individual signed FA for tarsus length and rectrix mass were quantified as difference in
54
55 190 measures between right (R) and left (L) (using average values obtained from the two
56

2
3 191 replicated measurements of each side) divided by individual mean trait size to neutralized
4
5 192 trait size effect [52]. Individual unsigned FA (the magnitude of signed FA) values were the
6
7 193 absolute values of signed FA.
8
9 194 The levels of significance of signed FA and its repeatability in the measured traits were
10
11
12
195 calculated by the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation of a mixed regression
13
14 196 model where we fitted the models to the repeated measurements of right and left trait sides
15
16 197 [53]. We included sides as fixed effects in the models and measured trait values (tarsi lengths
17
18 198 or rectrix masses) as response variables, intercept and sides as a random effects and
19
20 199 individual id as a subject. This procedure allows the separation of measurement error (ME)
21
22 200 from bilateral asymmetry analysis [53]. The presence of directional asymmetry (DA) was
23
24
25
201 assessed by the F-test of the fixed effects, with degrees of freedom corrected for statistical
26
27 202 dependence by Satterthwaite formulas [54]. We used random intercepts and slopes (both
28
29 203 estimated within individuals) to estimate the variation in individual trait value and the
30
31 204 individual signed FA, respectively, while the random error variance component gave the
32
33 205 measurement error. The significance of FA was then calculated by performing a likelihood
34
35 206 ratio (LR) test comparing two models: the original, full model and a reduced model without
36
37
207 the side (left or right) as a random effect. Then, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were
38
39
40 208 calculated to evaluate the repeatability of FA [53].
41
42 209 Absence of anti-symmetry, i.e. a type of asymmetry that occurs in a random direction,
43
44 210 producing a bimodal distribution over the population, was verified by testing the signed FA
45
46 211 for normal distribution.
47
48 212
49
50
213 2.5.2 Analysis of unsigned FA
51
52
53 214 A linear mixed model was fitted to the data to test whether unsigned FA levels in tarsus
54
55 215 length differed between birds of shade coffee forests and birds of natural forests in relation to:

14 221 2.5.3 Analysis of growth bar width
15
16 222 To test whether average growth bar widths differed between birds of shade coffee forests and
17
18 223 those of natural forests, we added average growth bar widths in the models as a response
19
20 224 variable, forest type and total feather lengths as a fixed effects, and sampling location as a
21
22 225 random effect. All statistical analyses were performed with program SAS (Version 9.4., SAS

33 230 average growth bar width from 344 birds (Table 1). For tarsus length, kurtosis ranges from K
34
35 231 = 4.20 in FF to K = 12.65 in OPI, for rectrix mass, it ranges from K = 49.76 in FF to K =
36
37
232 121.96 in OBI (Table S2). The signed FA of tarsus length and rectrix mass showed
38
39
40 233 leptokurtic distributions for all of the four guilds (K>3.0) (Kolmogrov-Smirnov test; all P <
41
42 234 0.01; Table S1), which indicates heterogeneity in developmental stability between individuals
43
44 235 (53.55). DA was detected for tarsus length (P = 0.0003), but not for rectrix mass (P = 0.7886;
45
46 236 Table S3).

3 241 high compared to between-side difference (ICC = 2.8 %). On the other hand, the signed FA
4
5 242 variance estimation was not significant relative to measurement error in rectrix mass (<U+03C7>2 = 1.7,
6
7 243 P = 0.1930), and level of within-side measurement error was very high compared to between-
8
9
10
244 side difference (ICC = 5.12x 10-4 %; Table S3). Hence, we did not include FA of rectrix mass
11
12 245 in further analyses.

15
16 247 3.2 Growth bar width
17
18 248 Average growth bar width of birds of the F, OBI and OPI guilds did not differ between shade
19
20
249 coffee forests and natural forests (for all three guilds P = 0.0598; Table 3). However, average
21
22
23 250 growth bar width for birds of the FF guild differed significantly between the two forest types
24
25 251 (P < 0.02) whereby birds of FF guild from shade coffee forests had narrower growth bars
26
27 252 than birds of this guild from natural forests. While the difference is not significant, birds of
28
29 253 the OBI guild from shade coffee forests showed reduced growth bar width compared to birds
30
31 254 of the same guild residing in natural forest (Fig.3).

35
36 256 4. Discussion
37
38 257 We applied biomarkers (FA in tarsus length and rectrix mass, and growth bar width and total
39
40 258 feather growth) to re-assess the quality of the Ethiopian tropical rain forest which was
41
42 259 reported to support rich avian biodiversity comparable to the natural forest except forest
43
44 260 specialist and understorey insectivore birds [34].
45
46
261 Birds did not show increased levels of fluctuating asymmetry in tarsus length
47
48
49 262 irrespective of guild membership and whether they were captured in shade coffee forests or
50
51 263 natural forest. Similarly, the analysis of feather growth bar widths revealed no difference in
52
53 264 among birds from shade coffee forests or natural forests with the exception of birds of the
54
55 265 forest specialist guild (FF), which showed lower growth bar width in shade coffee forests.

3 266 Also in the study by Buechley et al. [34] birds of the FF guild were found to be more
4
5 267 negatively affected than birds of other guilds. Species respond to habitat modifications
6
7 268 differently. Some species are more sensitive than others for various reasons, including
8
9 269 ecological specialization, diet and reproductive capacity [56,57]. This puts, most likely, forest
10
11
12
270 specialist birds at high risk of extinction [58-61]. About 21% of bird species of which most
13
14 271 are forest specialist are currently extinction-prone and 6.5% are functionally extinct [62].
15
16 272 Shade coffee farm management means selective removal of trees species, which may
17
18 273 decrease habitat quality for forest specialist birds more than for other avian guilds [5,9,63].
19
20 274 Other than for birds, Ethiopian shade coffee farming has been reported to be useful for forest
21
22 275 tree conservation but its conservation value strongly depends on the coverage of canopy of
23
24
25
276 overstorey shade trees which varied across shade coffee plantations [12]. Other studies
26
27 277 showed that shade coffee farming is incompatible with epiphytic orchid conservation [64].
28
29 278 While the importance of the Ethiopian shade coffee farming for biodiversity conservation is
30
31 279 undeniable, its conservation value could not replace the natural forest. Hence, the promotion
32
33 280 of shade coffee farming should emphasise the conversion of degraded forest into shade coffee
34
35 281 forests but not converting natural forest into shade coffee farms. No human modified habitat
36
37
282 has been found to substitute primary forests for biodiversity conservation in general [65].
38
39
40 283 Our study showed that fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of tarsi length is unaffected by
41
42 284 shade coffee farming in forest specialist birds, whereas birds of this guild have reduced
43
44 285 growth bar widths in shade coffee forests. Only few studies combined FA and feather growth
45
46 286 bar width analysis which showed the two markers showed consistent result or only one of the
47
48 287 markers show the effect of fragmentation (21,29,66). We recommend combining the two
49
50
288 biomarkers to assess effects of habitat fragmentation. We skipped the FA analysis for rectrix
51
52
53 289 mass as within-side measurement error was higher than the between-side difference. FA is a
54
55 290 sensitive measure of habitat quality that needs rigorous test for the validity of the data used
56

3 291 for the analysis, and could be very useful as early warning clue for a negative effects of
4
5 292 habitat change before any demographic change can be observed [67].
6
7 293 Currently, at least in our study area, the negative effects of converting natural forest
8
9 294 into shade coffee forests on bird communities are not dramatic. However, in many coffee
10
11
12
295 growing countries across the globe, shade coffee management practices are increasingly
13
14 296 intensified, which is believed to reduce plant diversity and canopy cover [68-71], and hence,
15
16 297 also reducing the quality or quantity of feeding, nesting or hiding resources for animal
17
18 298 populations. Such tendencies urge a close monitoring of habitat quality of shade coffee
19
20 299 forests with biomarkers which can detect changes of habitat quality before it is degraded to
21
22 300 the extent that it affects avian diversity and community demography [14,67,72,73].
23
24
25
301
26
27 302 5. Conclusion
28
29 303 Our results are consistent with results of demographic studies that shade coffee farming in the
30
31 304 Ethiopian highland can be compatible with avian diversity conservation. No early sign of
32
33 305 negative effect was observed from biomarker studies different from the demographic changes
34
35 306 reported by Buechely et al. [34]. However, results of our study in combination with Buechely
36
37
307 et al. [34] show that shade coffee farming has negative effects on the guild of forest
38
39
40 308 specialists, i.e. habitat quality for these bird species seems to decrease. Therefore, the current
41
42 309 promotion of shade coffee farming as means of biodiversity conservation should not lead to
43
44 310 the conversion of natural forests into shade coffee forests. Shade coffee can be used as an
45
46 311 important conservation tool whenever preserving natural forest is impossible for various
47
48 312 reasons, but it should not replace it. Combining FA and feather growth rate as biomarkers
49
50
313 provide more comprehensive results in studies of habitat quality for avian biodiversity
51
52
53 314 conservation than using only one of them.

Appendix B
Dear Sirs,
Thank you for your review and for letting us resubmit. We found the comments helpful and
constructive.
We incorporate comments and suggestions of the reviewers in the new version of manuscript.
We also did additional editorial work on top of the reviewers comment. The main concern of
the reviewer was the analysis of fluctuating symmetry of the avian community on the bases
of functional guilds, diet and forest specialization. We now updated the analysis of
fluctuating asymmetry on the bases of species residing in the two habitat types as suggested
by the reviewers.
Please find more detail of the changes we have made,
Sincerely,
Gelaye Gebremichae

Comments to the Author(s)
Overview:
This is a very interesting concept, applying morphometrics and fluctuating asymmetry in a
fairly novel fashion to study potential impacts of environmental quality of shade coffee and
natural forest on bird communities in SW Ethiopia. The study is novel and has the potential
to make a significant and important contribution to biodiversity conservation in Ethiopia, as
well as to encourage similar studies worldwide to evaluate early indicators of environmental
stresses on populations. On this level, I think it is suitable for publication in Royal Society
Open Science.
However, I also have some significant methodological concerns with the manuscript that
I hope can be addressed prior to publication. My biggest concern is regarding sample size and
guild classifications, as best outlined in Table 1. Is it really suitable to compare fluctuating
asymmetry and feather growth bar width of different species, as lumped into very general
guilds?
Our reply: Our updated version consider only species comparison between natural forest and
shade coffee habitat instead of the comparing avian community based on functional guilds.
1
The difference in samples sizes of species between shade coffee and natural forest for growth
bar width measurements seems particularly great. For example the top 4 species were almost
exclusively sampled in shade coffee. Thus how can you compare differences between
habitats??? I’m not sure that lumping them into guilds addresses this underlying issue in the
dataset. If you have a strong argument for why this is valid to compare, I think it should be
very prominently laid out in the methods and discussion. As is, there is really almost no
discussion of such lack of uneven sampling and how that might impact results. Otherwise,
perhaps the analysis should be limited to species that you have a reasonable sample size in
both habitat types…
Our reply: Yes, as we mentioned above, we have now updated the analysis based on species
comparison
I also have a bit of a concern with the guild classification for obligate insectivore vs
opportunistic insectivore, which is based on a seemingly arbitrary 80% insect-diet cut off. Is
there no way to make a more meaningful guild distinction, perhaps based on the
classifications in Buechley et al 2015 (i.e. insectivore / granivore / frugivore).
Our reply: This problem is also solved as we change the analysis to species level in the
updated manuscript version.
A couple of other fairly major comments are as follows:
• English was good throughout, up until the discussion, which could use some detailed
work simplifying and correcting grammatical errors.
Our reply: in our updated version, we have improved the language and fix grammatical
errors.
• Discussion has several bold claims about coffee forests in Ethiopia that I strongly
suggest toning back. This is an interesting study, but I don't think it is definitive enough to
say things like “the negative effects of converting natural forest into shade coffee forests on
bird communities are not dramatic [line 294]”
Our reply: we agreed and in the new version of our manuscript, we have modified this
particular sentence other sentence which appeared to be broad and debatable.
Line 71: “random” – if they are random, then how can they be an index of anything?
2
Our reply: FA is originally defined as “random deviations from left-right symmetry in
bilateral traits [24-27, reference in the main manuscript]”. To our understanding, from large
number of the sample size of the given traits, a random sample of the traits potentially can
reveal the deviation, either as length or weight measurements.
Line 78: What about using other bio-markers like mass?
Our reply: That is also a possibility and here we used a specific trait, rectrix mass
Lines 81-82: “the origin and reservoir” – i take issue with the wording here, as arabica also
originated and is still found in SW Arabia
Our reply: To our knowledge, the origin of the coffee arabica is Ethiopia and it crossed the
red sea to Yeman and other Arabian countries around the 7th century.
Line 94: tarsi length can be a hard measurement to standardize – perhaps address how this
was done in methods
Our reply: we have now provided in detail of how we measured the Tarsi length in the
method section on page 7, lines 147 and 148.
Line 95: Mass of the retrace? This seems an odd measurement!
Our reply: Okay we now replaced it with rectrices weight.
Line 97: replace assumed with hypothesized
Our reply: We have now made the change
Line 118: comma spacing
Our reply: we have now made the change
Line 123: has this directly impacted the study sites? If so how?
Our reply: yes, much of the natural forest is now modified to shade coffee. In the new
version of the manuscript, we have tried to explain this further
Line 134: this 80% cutoff seems arbitrary. Could you not find a more well-defined guild
separation, perhaps by following the definitions used in Buechley et al 2015?
Our reply: We have now excluded the analysis that based on functional guilds
3
Line 143: clarify where the rings are from (i.e. museum of nat hist)
Our reply: ring were obtained from National Museum of Kenya, and we now have
mentioned this in the manuscript on page 7, line 138.
Line 144: is this the only reason?
Our reply: for this particular research question, yes.
Table 1: I’m concerned about unbalanced sampling of the study species between habitat
types. Is it valid to compare fluctuating asymmetry / feather growth across species?
Our reply: we fully acknowledge this concern, and we now change our analysis to a species
comparison in the two habitat forms rather than guilds.
Lines 154 – 158: I’m a bit skeptical about this method. Retrix feathers are often soiled by
feces. Were the feathers cleaned prior to weighing? If so, how? Retrix feathers also undergo
major wear. It is not clear to me that tropical birds would necessarily have the same moult
pattern, thus different individuals may be under different levels of feather wear at any given
time, which could impact feather mass. I strongly suggest adding more detail of methods and
citations validating these indices here.
Our reply: we caught 488 individual birds of the ten species included in the previous
analysis. But our analysis was only fixed to feathers from individuals birds with
undamaged/unwearied and clean feathers (this is the reason why our sample size was small
for some species). Any feather those soiled with feces/ wearied were not included in the
analysis page 7, lines 155 and 156.
Line 162: “unwearied” – what does this mean??
Our reply: it is to mean damaged/worn out
Line 194: I like that repeatability of the measurements was included in the model
Our reply: Thanks. This is one of the most important precaution in ptilochronology studies
Line 231: spell out acronyms (e.g. FF, DA, etc) at start of new section
Our reply: we have done as suggested
4
Lines 241 – 245: was this caused by scale accuracy? If the scale is accurate, it seems this
would be the easier measurement to replicate. Can you explain this result more, perhaps in
Discussion?
Our reply: As we change the analysis from avian community comparison based on
functional guilds to species, some of the results including this section also changed.
Lines 252-254: show p value for this comment
Our reply: This is only descriptive, to show the raw data.
Lines 259 – 260: I would cut this sentence off at “natural forest”. It was shown to support
high richness, including of forest specialists and understory insectivores.
Our reply: we did as suggested
Line 261: I would lead with the significant result (FF with lower growth bar width) and then
follow with null findings.
Our reply: we have now modified the earlier analysis which was based on guilds to a species
level and we modified the discussion accordingly
Line 270-271: “most” – need to add percentage for this claim
Our reply: We have modified the sentence
Lines 278-279: I would rephrase this sentence away from bold claims
Our reply: we have now modified this sentence
Lines 283 – 284: again, I would back away from this overly-bold claim. I suggest rephrasing
to something like “our study identified no difference in FA between…”
Our reply: Following our new analysis on FA comparison between the species, we have
modified this sentence
Lines 293 – 294: again, I think an overly bold statement. Your study may add some support
to this idea, but I wouldn’t state that conversion does not have a dramatic impact.
Our reply: we agree, and we have now modified the sentence
Figure 2 and 3: check lower left heading “insectivore dependy on diet” for misspelling
Our reply: Okay we did that, and corrected the errors

Comments to the Author(s)
This study aims to assess avian habitat quality between natural forests and shade coffee
plantations in Ethiopia via individual measures of functional asymmetry and feather growth.
The overall aim of the study is excellent and attempts to address an area where much work is
needed. However, I am unable to evaluate the study and thus did not proceed to review the
results or discussion for one major reason.
The paper does not clarify the phenological life history of the 10 study species used. This is
crucial because the measures of local site habitat quality are entirely dependent on the
location of 1) where the measured tarsi were developed as nestlings, and 2) where the
measured feathers were grown. For example, if all 10 species were known to breed on site,
and it was assumed that the individuals did not disperse to or from elsewhere, then the tarsus
growth could be assumed to be influenced by the conditions of the study site. However, if the
bird was captured after it had migrated from its breeding location elsewhere onto the study
site, then the growth differences of the tarsus would reflect the habitat quality or conditions of
the site where the development took place. It is worrisome, for example, that juveniles were
not included in the study even though these would be an example of individuals for which
tarsi development location would have been known. Similarly, it is not clarified where the
rectrices feather growth took place and this is typically different depending on species and
age. In first year birds, the rectrices would have grown in on the breeding grounds. If the
captured birds were after-first-year adults, the rectrices might have molted in during different
time periods and at different locations depending on the species. If this information is
unknown then the only way to know for certain that a feather was grown at the study site
would be to pluck the feather of unknown origin and then pluck the regrown feather from the
recaptured bird. Thus the feather growth rate would reflect conditions at that specific site and
not the location where the original plucked feather was grown.
It is my assumption that this information was taken into account and it is known but simply
not reported. For example, it could be that the ten species are known to breed (and thus
develop their tarsi) on site. It could be that the species are migrants from another breeding
site but they moult rectrices during the time period in which they are captured on site, or they
are year round residents and thus perform their moulting cycles on site (and do not move
between the forest and shade coffee). I am happy to review the paper again if this is the case.
However, if this type of information is unavailable then I am afraid it is impossible to know
whether the tarsi and feather measures reflect what the authors assume they reflect.
Our reply: We ring birds for more than three years in this particular study sites and we never
come across individual birds those move from one fragment to another. Individual birds were
caught first as immature later as adult rewrap in the same sites year after years. From this we
conclude most of the birds born and grow on the same sites, and not migrate from one forest
to other. We have this experience from our previous study on bird species richness, diversity
6
and community structure in the same study sites using mist netting procedures where all
captured individuals ringed (Buechley et al., 2015).

**********************************************
Line 27 and 28, I suggest making explicitly clear the two step assumption and prediction
here, which then leads to your final indirect assumption (prediction):
1. You assume (presumably based on previous work that will be detailed in the text) that
higher FA and narrower feather growth bars indicate comparatively lower Habitat Quality,
and
2. You predict lower habitat quality in shade coffee vs. natural forest (as indicated by higher
FA and narrower growth bars).
Our reply: we have now clarified the two assumptions clearly in the updated manuscript
version
Line 28, page 2
Line 28 page 2, I think I understand what you are getting at here, but perhaps add a sentence
or a few words to clarify. The reader might wonder why it is suggested that these habitats be
converted to shade coffee vs. restored to healthy forests. So adding something about degraded
forests being converted into shade coffee as compensation for lost coffee production due to
forest protection would clarify. Also, is shade coffee considered to be of higher quality than
degraded forest?
Our reply: Okay we have now clarified this sentence
7
Line 28 page 2, Replace with the actual number
Our reply: Okay, we have made the change accordingly
Line 50, insert bird before species
Our reply: we have inserted bird as suggested
Line 51, page 3, in shade coffee farming have been shown to be comparable to natural forests
in some cases (8-10), and not in others (several citations - see reviewr comments).
Our reply: we fully understand this, and have tried to clarify the sentence
Line 51, change was to has been
Our reply: we have made the changes accordingly
Line 51, in shade coffee farming have been shown to be comparable to natural forests in
some cases (8-10), and not in others (several citations - see reviewr comments).
Our reply: Okay, we have done as suggested [11-14] line 48.
Line 53, I made a few suggestions for how to tone down this statement. There has been
evidence presented, as the introduction suggests, that remnant forest and shade coffee are
comparable in terms of these bird measures, but I would not go so far to state “no negative
effect” because the story is more nuanced. There are several examples where shade coffee
measures of bird species richness, etc, were lower than native forest remnants (and this
should be noted). For example, see this review and citations therein:
Komar. 2006. Ecology and conservation of birds in coffee plantations: a critical review. Bird
Conservation International 16:1-23:
“As expected, bird species-richness and diversity in shaded coffee plantations tend to be
lower than in nearby forest patches (Terborgh and Weske 1969, Beehler et al. 1987, Thiollay
1995, Wunderle and Latta 1996, Estrada et al. 1997, Greenberg et al. 1997a, Petit et al. 1999),
although studies in some landscapes have documented the same or even higher species
richness as natural forest (Aguilar- Ortiz 1982, Greenberg et al. 1997b, Shahabuddin 1997,
Tejeda-Cruz and Sutherland 2004). Species diversity in shaded plantations is nearly always
reported to be considerably higher than in open-sun plantations or other types of monoculture
(Beehler et al. 1987, Wunderle and Latta 1996, Estrada et al. 1997, González 1999, Petit et al.
1999, Tejeda-Cruz and Sutherland 2004).”
Our reply: Okay, we have now modified the paragraph to show the importance of shade
coffee for biodiversity conservation is not always the case
Line 56 This sentence could be broken into two or three sentences for clarity.
Our reply: Okay, we have broken the sentence in to two.
Line 62, Please provide a few citations of examples.
8
Our reply: Okay we have included few citations
Line 65, Insert “relative levels of”
Our reply: we have inserted “relative levels of” as suggested
Line 65, be careful with how this is stated. Quality could be considered lower or higher
depending on the specific comparisons of these stress measures. For example, it is not stated
that body mass, size, etc. is explicitly lower and thus equates with lower quality... stay more
general here.
Our reply: Okay. We did as suggested
Line 65, delete lower
Our reply: We did the change as suggested
Line 66 to 70, These are two important points that aren't necessarily connected; please break
up the long sentence into two.
Our reply: We did the changes as suggested
Line 71 to 78, No need to go into an exhaustive review of these two measures, but since the
entire study is based on FA and feather growth, it would help the reader to have a bit more
justification for the validity of the methods. Please more explicitly explain the links between
FA and Feather Growth to fundamental life history components. Also, what do you think
about the criticisms of ptilochronology? (for example, see citations below). Again, no need
for too much detail but please add in a few more clarifying sentences to make the life history
links and very briefly address the criticisms of Murphy.
Murphy and King. 1991. Ptilochronology: a critical evaluation of assumptions and utility.
The Auk 108:695-704
Murphy. 1992. Ptilochronology: accuracy and reliability of the technique. The Auk 109:676-
680.
Our reply: Okay we have include this debate in the discussion section
Line 87, delte however
Our reply: we have deleted the word “delete”
9
Line 88, delete therefore
Our reply: we have made the change as suggested
Line 97, replace ,,,, by “is of lower quality than natural forests”,
Our reply: We did the change as suggested
97, replace ,,,,, by “predicted”
Our reply: we did as suggested
Line 99, Based on next two comments, please rework this section. I can see why nestling
growth effects might affect bird health in later years, but that isn't described here.
Our reply: Okay, we have done as suggested lines 101 & 102.
Line 101, so this demonstrates previous effects, not subsequent effects as stated earlier in the
sentence.
Our reply: We did as suggested.
Line 102, But stress induced during one feather growth period does not necessarily indicate
anything about stress during future molt periods. It only indicates stress levels during the
particular growth phase measured.
Our reply: Yes, that is true. In the current version we have addressed this issue lines
102&103.
Line 126 , Do these birds occupy the sites year round? During what time period do they
moult their rectrices? Do they grow their rectrices on site or during another season at another
site? If measured feathers were grown offsite, then feathers must be plucked and feathers
regrown onsite must again be plucked and measured to quantify local conditions. This point
is crucial to the entire study so please clarify.
Our reply: The species included in this study are resident bird species and they stay in the
sites year round. They grow the rectrices on the sites lines 131&132.
Line 128, delete already
Our reply: we have made the change
Line 138, Birds were captured year round? So breeding, migrant/transient, and overwintering
birds were all included or were only birds that developed as nestlings and/or moulted in
rectrices on site used for analysis? Crucial point, please clarify.
10
Our reply: No, birds were captured from 9 December, 2013 to 30 March, 2014 and 19
December, 2014 to 10 June, 2015. Migrant birds/transient, and overwintering birds were not
included this analysis. We only analyzed the data of bird that were developed as nestling
and/or moulted rectrices on the site.
Line 139, mist-netting procedures.
Our reply: we have made the change accordingly
Line 140, replace controlled by Checked
Our reply: we have made the change accordingly
Line 140, delete
Our reply: we have made the change accordingly
Line 142, why?
Our reply: We, fully admit this is a mistake. And corrected it in the current version, even the
immature individual were also included in tarsus analysis.
Line 152, By two different observers?
Our reply: the observer was the same person
Line 154, replace ,,,,, by retrix
Our reply: we did the change as suggested
Line 155, what is the life history of these birds? When were these feathers grown? Where
they grown on the study site or were these birds migrants and thus the feather growth took
place in a different location? It is impossible to evaluate this study without knowing this.
Our reply: Our study species were resident, stay round in a site where they were captured.
Feather growth and moult were takes place in the same sites (in our study sites). These
species do not migrate from one forest fragment to the other. Even if we made many years
ringing effort, we did not captured individuals that captured in one forest fragment in other.
Line 160, Again. This procedure completely depends on when these feathers were grown.
Are these birds year round residents of their various plots and therefore the feather growth
reflects the conditions of that habitat? Or, are any of these birds migrants that only use the
study sites during a certain time period? Do they occupy the sites when rectrices molt occurs?
If the feathers grow in offsite, then the growth bars do not represent the quality of the habitat
in question.
Our reply: Bird species of our study are resident and stay year round in sampling sites.
Previous work of Buechley et al., 2015 have showed that these bird species have breeding
population in this particular study plots. Gebremichael et al., unpublished data also showed
that these bird species were breed and moult in the study plots of our study area.
Line 194, perhaps begin this section by stating that you followed the analysis procedures
described in citation 53.
Our reply: we have made the changes accordingly
11
Line 198: is this the random slope for side?
Our reply: yes, the random side is for random slop that estimates FA within individual.
Line 224, because different species were grouped into functional groups, species should
probably also be included as a random effect, otherwise a particular species within a group
might bias the results.
Our reply: This is true, and in the updated manuscript we re-analysed the data as species
comparison rather than the former analysis which is based on guilds of functional guilds

10
11
20 Shade coffee farming has been promoted as a means for combining sustainable use of forests
12
13
14 21 and biodiversity conservation. Both in shade coffee and natural forests a similar diversity and
15
16 22 abundance of birds have been found. However, the negative effects on such indicators for
17
18 23 habitat quality may become obvious only after some time, because of a constant influx of
19
20
21 24 birds from nearby subpopulations in natural forests. Therefore other indicators for habitat
22
23 25 quality of shade coffee forests should possibly be applied. We used two biomarkers,
24
25 26 fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of tarsus length and rectrix mass, and feather growth bars
26
27
28
27 (average growth bar width), assuming higher FA and narrower feather growth bars in shade
29
30 28 coffee forest than in a natural forest. We measured and compared 320 and 223 individual
31
32 29 birds of five species for tarsus length and rectrix mass, respectively from both forest types.
33
34
30 The extent of FA in both traits (tarsus length and rectrix mass) showed no difference between
35
36
37 31 the two forest types in any of the five species. Similarly, no difference was found in growth
38
39 32 bar widths in any of these species between shade coffee and natural forest. Therefore, we
40
41 33 conclude that shade coffee farming in Afrotropical rain forests of Ethiopia is compatible with
42
43
44 34 avian conservation.

8 39 range of ecosystem services [1]. However, these forests are shrinking at unprecedented rates
9
10 40 [2,3]. Agricultural practices compatible with forest conservation have been proposed as a
11
12
41 potential strategy to slow down, stop or even reverse the current alarming rate of
13
14
15 42 deforestation [4].
16
17 43 Shade coffee farming, i.e. growing coffee beneath the canopy of shade trees, has
18
19 44 recently gained support as a form of agricultural practice that is, at least partly, more
20
21
22 45 compatible with biodiversity conservation than other agricultural practices [5-7]. However,
23
24 46 the results of various studies are contradictory. For instance, species richness, abundance and
25
26 47 community composition of birds in shade coffee forests have been shown to be similar to
27
28
29 48 those in natural forests in some studies <U+F05B>8-10<U+F05D>, but not in others<U+F05B>11-14<U+F05D>. But compared to
30
31 49 nearby open-sun plantation, bird species diversity in shade coffee forests is notably higher
32
33 50 <U+F05B>9,12,13<U+F05D>. Therefore, it has been concluded, that shade coffee farming can play an important
34
35
36 51 role when combining biodiversity conservation and agro-forestry [15,16].
37
38 52 Such inference implicitly assumes that populations inhabiting shade coffee forests also
39
40 53 share equal prospects of reproduction or/and long-term survival with conspecifics residing in
41
42
43 54 pristine forests [17,18]. However, demographic changes in the distribution of sex or age
44
45 55 classes, changes in rates of survival or reproduction, which results from biotic changes, are
46
47 56 possibly long-term effects. These are unlikely to be picked up by community-level studies on
48
49
50
57 demography and a-diversity alone if surveys are done shortly after natural forests have been
51
52 58 transformed into shade coffee forests. Communities can be affected without any noticeable
53
54 59 change in diversity and abundance due to time lags in responses or immigration from nearby
55
56
60 source populations [19,20]. To overcome problems of diversity and demography abundance
57
58
59 61 based studies, a growing number of studies applied phenotypic or physiological proxies of

2
3 62 fitness (biomarkers), such as body size, body mass, fat-free mass, or the rate or precision of
4
5
6 63 growth. These markers are all thought to be able to indicate stress (e.g. nutritional stress), and
7
8 64 thus relative levels of habitat quality <U+F05B>21,22<U+F05D>. Habitat quality, in turn, have effects on
9
10
65 respective populations in the long run [21,22]. Stress-mediated changes should preferably be
11
12
13 66 detectable before direct components of fitness are compromised (see [23] for a list of criteria
14
15 67 to evaluate biomarkers). Most important, conservation contexts, collecting respective data
16
17 68 should not involve lethal sampling, exhaustive training or expensive equipment.
18
19
20 69 Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), i.e. small random deviations from left-right symmetry in
21
22 70 bilateral traits [24-27], and feather growth rate, measured as the width of alternating dark and
23
24 71 light growth-bars on bird feathers [ptilochronology, 28-31], fulfilling the above criteria. The
25
26
27
72 benefits of these markers are based on their ease, low cost, and non-lethality of measurement
28
29 73 and their link to fundamental life-history components that are otherwise more laborious to
30
31 74 measure [32]. When applied in tandem [33,34], they provide an overall, integrated picture of
32
33
75 environmental and nutritional stress effects [21], which in turn can provide information on
34
35
36 76 habitat quality.
37
38 77 Ethiopian coffee mainly grows in tropical rainforest remnants belonging to the Eastern
39
40 78 Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. This hotspot is known for its exceptionally high level of
41
42
43 79 biodiversity and endemicity [35]. The respective forests are also the origin and reservoir of
44
45 80 wild Coffea arabica [36,37]. Buechley et al. [38] showed that bird diversity in shade coffee
46
47 81 forests in SW Ethiopia did not significantly differ from that of ecologically comparable
48
49
50
82 natural moist evergreen Afromontane forests in the same region. The forests used for coffee
51
52 83 production even hosted over more than twice the number of species of the latter. While all
53
54 84 bird species recorded in primary forest control sites were also recorded in shade coffee
55
56
85 forests, shade coffee plots showed a lower abundance of forest specialists and understorey
57
58
59 86 insectivores. The authors concluded that, while Ethiopian shade coffee farming is perhaps the
60

Page 5 of 41 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 87 most "bird-friendly" coffee in the world, the little-disturbed forest remains critical for
4
5
6 88 sustaining at-risk groups of birds, such as forest specialist birds [38].
7
8 89 To determine whether populations of forest-dependent species that currently persist in
9
10 90 Ethiopian shade coffee forest show signs of increased environmental and/or nutritional stress
11
12
13
91 compared to conspecifics from natural forests, we revisited a subset of the study plots
14
15 92 sampled by Buechley et al. [38] and measured FA of two phenotypic traits (length of tarsi
16
17 93 and mass of the second outermost rectrices) and feather growth bars of the second outermost
18
19
94 rectrices in 320 individual birds belonging to five species. We carried out this study with the
20
21
22 95 previous studies that predict higher FA and narrower feather growth bars indicate
23
24 96 comparatively lower habitat quality <U+F05B>21,32-34<U+F05D>. That is if shade coffee is of lower quality
25
26
27
97 than natural forests we hypothesized higher FA and lower feather growth rates (i.e., narrower
28
29 98 feather growth bars) in birds from shade coffee forests as compared to birds from undisturbed
30
31 99 forests. Studying both traits allowed us to assess possible adverse effects of shade coffee
32
33
100 farming during different stages of life. Since tarsi are already fully grown before fledging,
34
35
36 101 this measure provides information on stress during the nestling period [39,40], and greatly
37
38 102 influence future survival and reproductive success [35,41-45]. On the other hand, rectrices
39
40 103 are moulted throughout adult life, providing information on stress at particular time of the
41
42
43 104 adult individuals’ life-history.
44
45 105 1. Materials and method
46
47 106 2.1 Study site
48
49
50
107 The study was conducted in south-western Ethiopia at three sites in shade coffee farming area
51
52 108 (422 km2): Fetche, Garuke, and Yebu, and at four natural forest sites in the Belete-Gera
53
54 109 Forest (920 km2): Afalo, Abana Buna, Qacho, and Muje (Fig. 1).
55
56
110 In the shade coffee production scheme, the forest was modified from the original forest
57
58
59 111 to improve the productivity of coffee plants by reducing tree and shrub density. This leads to
60

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 6 of 41

2
3 112 obvious differences in the vegetation density and canopy cover compared to the natural
4
5
6 113 forest. In the shade coffee areas seedling density, stem density and crown cover of indigenous
7
8 114 trees were 3000 ha-1, 655 ha-1 and 79%, respectively, whereas in natural forests respective
9
10 115 numbers were 10,000 ha-1, 952 ha-1 and 86.7% [46].
11
12
13
116 The Belete-Gera Forest is one of the largest remaining tracts of forest in south-western
14
15 117 Ethiopia. It is a typical Afromontane evergreen forest, dominated by tree species like
16
17 118 Syzigium guineense, Olea welwitchii, Prunus africana and Pouteria adolfi-friederici, with
18
19
20
119 over 157 plant species representing 69 families and 135 genera <U+F05B>47,48]. Its animal diversity
21
22 120 has never been thoroughly studied, but during a one month pilot study, 25 mammal, 16
23
24 121 amphibian, 5 reptile, 126 bird and 87 butterfly species have been identified [49]. The forest is
25
26
27
122 considered as a regional forest priority area and “Key Biodiversity Area” (KBA). Regardless
28
29 123 of this, deforestation and habitat modification continues to shade coffee in the region.
30
31 124 2.2 Study species
32
33
125 Our study focussed on five bird species; Abyssinian Ground Thrush, Rüppell’s Robin-chat,
34
35
36 126 Grey-backed Camaroptera, African dusky Flycatcher and Tambourine Dove which are found
37
38 127 in both forest types (Table 1). Based on their primary habitat utilization, the former two
39
40 128 species are considered forest species while the latter three species are considered as non-
41
42
43 129 forest species [50-56]. Based on their feeding habit; Rüppell’s Robin-chat, Grey-backed
44
45 130 Camaroptera and African dusky Flycatcher are regarded as insectivore, Abyssinian Ground
46
47 131 Thrush as omnivore and Tambourine Dove as granivores <U+F05B>57<U+F05D>. These species are resident
48
49
50 132 [58], and have breeding populations at our study sites [38].
51
52 133 2.3 Data collection
53
54 134 From December 2013 to June 2015, we captured 351 birds belonging to five bird species
55
56
57
135 using mist-netting procedures. We opened the nets 30 minutes before sunrise and kept them
58
59 136 open for six hours. We checked the nets routinely at 30-min intervals to remove birds without

2
3 137 holding them too long. Upon capture, 1) we ringed each individual bird with rings from
4
5
6 138 National Museum of Kenya, aged, weighted (to the nearest 0.01g using digital balance), 2)
7
8 139 measured tarsus length (to the nearest 0.1 mm with Vernier callipers), and wing length (to the
9
10 140 nearest 0.5 mm using wing ruler), and 3) plucked the second outermost (the fifth) of right and
11
12
13
141 left rectrices feathers from individual captured birds. We released the birds immediately after
14
15 142 we collected feather samples and took the measurements on the spot.
16
17 143 2.3.1 Measurement of tarsi length and rectrix mass
18
19
144 Fluctuating asymmetry was determined from two traits, tarsi length, and rectrix mass.
20
21
22 145 Different traits have different susceptibility for FA based on cost of growth of the trait,
23
24 146 defined as the amount of structural components necessary to form a unit of length of a given
25
26 147 character [59] hence we used both traits. Tarsi length, distance from the back of inter-tarsal
27
28
29 148 joint to the point where the toes bending an angle of 90 degree to the tarsus [60], was
30
31 149 measured in the field to the nearest 0.1 mm using Vernier callipers. Two independent
32
33 150 measurements of right and left tarsus lengths for each individual (sequence right-left-right-
34
35
36
151 left or left-right-left-right) were taken. The second outer most right and left rectrices (fully-
37
38 152 grown) rectrices feathers were collected from every bird captured for rectrix mass and growth
39
40 153 bar measurements [33]. The feathers were stored in separately labelled dry paper envelopes
41
42
154 and transported to the laboratory, and the rectrices were weighted twice using an analytical
43
44
45 155 balance to the nearest 0.1 mg. Tarsi with anomalies were not measured, and rectrices with
46
47 156 damaged tips or soiled with faeces were not collected.
48
49 157 2.3.2 Measurement of growth bar widths
50
51
52 158 Growth bar widths and total feather lengths were measured by one of us (GG) as follow: (1)
53
54 159 each unwearied feather was pinned on separate, white, polystyrene boards and total feather
55
56 160 length was measured to the nearest 0.01 mm with a digital calliper. (2) Each feather was
57
58
59
161 marked at a distance of 7/10 from its proximal end, and the proximate and distal ends of 5
60
7
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 41
1
2
3 162 consecutive growth bars were marked with ultrafine mounting pins. (3) Each marked board
4
5
6 163 was scanned (Oce OP1130) and growth bar widths and total feather lengths were
7
8 164 automatically measured with an image-analysis-software (KS400 Zeiss). The entire
9
10 165 procedure was repeated for 66 randomly selected feathers to assess the repeatability of our
11
12
13
166 measurements.
14
15 167
16
17 168 2.4 Data validation
18
19
169 Possible data outliers were detected using Cook distance (Cookd) (in SAS) to ensure data
20
21
22 170 quality for all measurements (tarsus length, feather mass, feather length, and average growth
23
24 171 bar widths), whereby influential observation values were screened out from the data.
25
26 172 The level of repeatability for the growth bar widths was calculated according to Lessells
27
28
29 173 and Boag [61], whereby within-group and between group mean squares were obtained from
30
31 174 1-way ANOVAs, and the p-values were obtained from F-tests. Repeatability estimates were
32
33 175 high, both for total feather length (right trait side: r = 0.999, N = 66, P = <0.001; left trait
34
35
36
176 side: r = 0.999, N = 66, P < 0.001) and for average growth bar widths (right trait side: r =
37
38 177 0.992, N = 66, P < 0.000; left trait side: r = 0.983, N = 66, P < 0.001).
39
40 178 Since the residuals of the measured traits (unsigned FA values for tarsus length and
41
42
179 rectrix mass) deviated from respective normal distributions (Shapiro-Wilk test; see Table S1),
43
44
45 180 the data were transformed using Box-Cox transformation to meet normality assumptions
46
47 181 before further analysis.
48
49 182
50
51
52 183 2.5 Data analyses
53
54 184 2.5.1 Analysis of fluctuating asymmetry
55
56 185 Individual signed FA for tarsus length and rectrix mass were quantified as a difference in
57
58
59
186 measures between right (R) and left (L) (using average values obtained from the two
60
8
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 9 of 41 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 187 replicated measurements of each side) [62]. Individual unsigned FA (the magnitude of signed
4
5
6 188 FA) values were the absolute values of signed FA.
7
8 189 Following Van Dongen et al. (1999), the levels of significance of signed FA and its
9
10 190 repeatability in the measured traits were calculated by the restricted maximum likelihood
11
12
13
191 (REML) estimation of a mixed regression model where we fitted the models to the repeated
14
15 192 measurements of right and left trait sides [63]. We included sides as fixed effects in the
16
17 193 models and measured trait values (tarsi lengths or rectrix masses) as response variables,
18
19
194 intercept and sides as a random effect and individual id as a subject. This procedure allows
20
21
22 195 the separation of measurement error (ME) from bilateral asymmetry analysis [63]. The
23
24 196 presence of directional asymmetry (DA) was assessed by the F-test of the fixed effects, with
25
26 197 degrees of freedom corrected for statistical dependence by Satterthwaite formulas [64]. We
27
28
29 198 used random intercepts and slopes (both estimated within individuals) to estimate the
30
31 199 variation in individual trait value and the individual signed FA, respectively, while the
32
33 200 random error variance component gave the measurement error. The significance of FA was
34
35
36
201 then calculated by performing a likelihood ratio (LR) test comparing two models: the
37
38 202 original, full model and a reduced model without the side (left or right) as a random effect.
39
40 203 Then, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to evaluate the repeatability
41
42
204 of FA [63].
43
44
45 205 Absence of anti-symmetry, i.e. a type of asymmetry that occurs in a random direction,
46
47 206 producing a bimodal distribution over the population, was verified by testing the signed FA
48
49 207 for normal distribution.
50
51
52 208
53
54 209 2.5.2 Analysis of unsigned FA
55
56 210 The linear mixed model was fitted to the data to test whether unsigned FA levels in tarsus
57
58
59
211 length differed between birds of shade coffee forests and birds of natural forests whereby
60
9
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 10 of 41
1
2
3 212 unsigned FA was included as a response variable, forest type as a fixed effect and each
4
5
6 213 sampling location as a random effect.
7
8 214 Model selection was done using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for the species with
9
10 215 moderate sample sizes (Rüppell’s Robin-chat and Tambourine Dove). For the species with
11
12
13
216 small sample sizes (Abyssinian Ground Thrush, Grey-backed Camaroptera, and African
14
15 217 Dusky Flycatcher), model selection was done using AICc (the form of AIC corrected for
16
17 218 small sample size).
18
19
219 2.5.3 Analysis of growth bar width
20
21
22 220 To test whether average growth bar widths differed between birds of shade coffee forests and
23
24 221 those of natural forests, we added average growth bar widths in the models as a response
25
26 222 variable, forest type and total feather lengths as fixed effects, and sampling location as a
27
28
29 223 random effect. All statistical analyses were performed with program SAS (Version 9.4., SAS
30
31 224 Institute 2013, Cary, NC, USA).
32
33 225 2. Results
34
35
36
226 We retrieved measures of tarsus length from 320 birds, and measures of rectrix mass and
37
38 227 average growth bar width from 223 birds belongs to five species (Table 1). For tarsus length,
39
40 228 kurtosis ranges from K = 0.33 in Tambourine Dove to K = 6.82 in Abyssinian Ground
41
42
229 Thrush, for rectrix mass, it ranges from K = 3.551 in Abyssinian Ground Thrush to K = 24.75
43
44
45 230 in Tambourine Dove (Table S1). The signed FA showed leptokurtic distribution in tarsus
46
47 231 length and rectrix mass for Abyssinian Ground Thrush, African dusky Flycatcher and Grey-
48
49 232 backed Camaroptera, whereas Rüppell’s Robin-chat and Tambourine Dove showed such
50
51
52 233 distribution in rectrix mass only (K>3.0) (Shapiro Wilk test; all P = 0.0257; Table S1), which
53
54 234 indicates heterogeneity in developmental stability between individuals <U+F05B>63,65]. DA was
55
56
235 detected for tarsus length (P = 0.0005), but not for rectrix mass (P = 0.0967; Table S2).

2
3 237 The signed FA variance estimation was highly significant relative to measurement error in
4
5
6 238 both tarsus length (<U+F063>2 = 789.7, df = 1, P < 0.0001) and rectrix mass (<U+F063>2 = 449.1, df = 1, P <
7
8 239 0.0001) (Table S2). But, the level of within-side measurement error was high compared to
9
10
240 between-side difference in both traits (tarsus: ICC = 22.3 % and rectrix mass: ICC = 2.5*10-
11
12
241 5). Furthermore, the level of unsigned FA both in tarsus length and rectrix mass did not differ
13
14
15 242 between natural forests and shade coffee forests for all species, Abyssinian Ground Thrush,
16
17 243 African dusky Flycatcher, Grey-backed Camaroptera, Tambourine Dove and Rüppell's
18
19
20 244 Robin-chat (all: P <U+F0B3> 0.0521; Table 2 & 3). In spite of this, Abyssinian Ground Thrush,
21
22 245 African dusky Flycatcher, and Tambourine Dove show higher FA both in tarsus length and
23
24 246 rectrix mass in shade coffee than their conspecifics in natural forest (Fig. 2 a & b). On the
25
26
27 247 other hand, Rüppell's Robin-chat showed higher FA only in tarsus length in shade coffee
28
29 248 forests.
30
31 249 3.2 Growth bar width
32
33
34
250 Average growth bar width of the five bird species did not differ between shade coffee and
35
36 251 natural forests (all species: P <U+F0B3> 0.1409; Table 4). Furthermore, mean rectrix length did not
37
38 252 show variation between shade coffee and natural forests (all species: P <U+F0B3> 0.1587; Table S3).
39
40
41 253 Despite this, Tambourine Dove showed wider average growth bar in the natural forests,
42
43 254 whereas Grey-backed Camaroptera showed narrower growth bar in the natural forest (Fig.3).
44
45 255 3. Discussion
46
47
48 256 Several studies based on species richness, abundance and community composition revealed
49
50 257 that shade coffee farming has an important role in biodiversity conservation [8-10,15,16].
51
52 258 Yet, the intensification of coffee management urges a close monitoring of habitat quality of
53
54
55
259 shade coffee farms with methods which can detect changes of habitat quality before it is
56
57 260 degraded to the extent that it affects avian community demography [66-68]. Here, we applied
58
59 261 biomarkers (FA in tarsus length and rectrix mass, and growth bar width and total feather
60

3 262 length) to re-assess the quality of the Ethiopian tropical rain forest which was reported to
4
5
6 263 support rich avian biodiversity comparable to the natural forest based on demographic studies
7
8 264 [38].
9
10 265 FA in both traits (tarsus length and rectrix mass) did not show a significant difference
11
12
13
266 in birds of shade coffee forests and natural forest including in forest species. Similarly, the
14
15 267 analysis of feather growth bar widths revealed no significant difference between birds of the
16
17 268 two forest types. Our results are in contrast to Buechley et al. [38] who reported that forest
18
19
269 specialist guilds and understory-insectivore were more negatively affected than birds of other
20
21
22 270 guilds.
23
24 271 Currently, in our study area, the negative effects of shade coffee farming is not evident
25
26 272 in any of the bird species. Yet, the long-term impact of the on-going shade coffee plantation
27
28
29 273 modification and management may be closely monitored. Shade coffee farm management
30
31 274 which is selective removal of trees species may decrease habitat quality of shade coffee
32
33 275 plantation for avian biodiversity [5,69]. In many coffee growing countries across the globe,
34
35
36
276 shade coffee management practices are also increasingly intensified, which is believed to
37
38 277 reduce plant diversity and canopy cover [68,70-72], and hence, also reducing the quality or
39
40 278 quantity of feeding, nesting or hiding resources for animal populations. Such tendencies urge
41
42
279 a close monitoring of habitat quality of shade coffee forests with biomarkers which can detect
43
44
45 280 changes of habitat quality before it is degraded to the extent that it affects avian diversity and
46
47 281 community demography [18,66,73,74]. Globally, about 21% of bird species are currently
48
49 282 extinction-prone and 6.5% are functionally extinct [75] which urges enhanced conservation
50
51
52 283 and monitoring effort.
53
54 284 Future studies also may combine FA analysis in tarsus length and rectrix mass as
55
56 285 implemented in this study to provide a more comprehensive result. Only a few studies
57
58
59
286 combined FA and feather growth bar width analysis which showed the two markers showed

287 consistent result or only one of the markers show the effect of fragmentation <U+F05B>25,33,76<U+F05D>. We
4
5
6 288 recommend combining the two biomarkers to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation. FA
7
8 289 is a sensitive measure of habitat quality that needs a rigorous test for the validity of the data
9
10
290 used for the analysis and could be very useful as early warning clue for negative effects of
11
12
13 291 habitat change before any demographic change can be observed [66].
14
15 292 4. Conclusion
16
17 293 Our results are consistent with results of many of the demographic studies that shade coffee
18
19
20 294 farming in the Ethiopian highland can be compatible with avian diversity conservation. No
21
22 295 early sign of negative effect was observed from biomarker studies. Buechley et al. [38]
23
24 296 showed that shade coffee farming has an important contribution for the avian biodiversity
25
26
27
297 conservation though forest specialist birds are disproportionally affected in shade coffee
28
29 298 farms. While the current biomarker-based study did not reveal any singe of negative effect, it
30
31 299 is important to continue monitoring the Ethiopian shade coffee for the avian biodiversity
32
33
300 conservation as the shade coffee plantation is still under pressure of modification and subject
34
35
36 301 for the increasing level of fragmentation. We also recommend combining FA and feather
37
38 302 growth bars as biomarkers to provide more comprehensive results in studies of habitat quality
39
40 303 for avian biodiversity conservation than using only one of them.

3 Dear Sirs,
4
5 Thank you for your review and for letting us resubmit. We found the comments helpful and
6
7 constructive.
8
9 We incorporate comments and suggestions of the reviewers in the new version of manuscript.
10
11 We also did additional editorial work on top of the reviewers comment. The main concern of
12
13 the reviewer was the analysis of fluctuating symmetry of the avian community on the bases
14
15
of functional guilds, diet and forest specialization. We now updated the analysis of
16 fluctuating asymmetry on the bases of species residing in the two habitat types as suggested
17
18 by the reviewers.

39 Overview:
40
41 This is a very interesting concept, applying morphometrics and fluctuating asymmetry in a
42
43
fairly novel fashion to study potential impacts of environmental quality of shade coffee and
44 natural forest on bird communities in SW Ethiopia. The study is novel and has the potential
45 to make a significant and important contribution to biodiversity conservation in Ethiopia, as
46
47
well as to encourage similar studies worldwide to evaluate early indicators of environmental
48 stresses on populations. On this level, I think it is suitable for publication in Royal Society
49 Open Science.
50
51 However, I also have some significant methodological concerns with the manuscript that
52
53 I hope can be addressed prior to publication. My biggest concern is regarding sample size and
54 guild classifications, as best outlined in Table 1. Is it really suitable to compare fluctuating
55 asymmetry and feather growth bar width of different species, as lumped into very general
56
57 guilds?
58
59 Our reply: Our updated version consider only species comparison between natural forest and
60 shade coffee habitat instead of the comparing avian community based on functional guilds.

The difference in samples sizes of species between shade coffee and natural forest for growth
7 bar width measurements seems particularly great. For example the top 4 species were almost
8 exclusively sampled in shade coffee. Thus how can you compare differences between
9
habitats??? I’m not sure that lumping them into guilds addresses this underlying issue in the
10
11 dataset. If you have a strong argument for why this is valid to compare, I think it should be
12 very prominently laid out in the methods and discussion. As is, there is really almost no
13
discussion of such lack of uneven sampling and how that might impact results. Otherwise,
14
15 perhaps the analysis should be limited to species that you have a reasonable sample size in
16 both habitat types…
17
18 Our reply: Yes, as we mentioned above, we have now updated the analysis based on species
19
20 comparison
21
22
23
24 I also have a bit of a concern with the guild classification for obligate insectivore vs
25 opportunistic insectivore, which is based on a seemingly arbitrary 80% insect-diet cut off. Is
26
27
there no way to make a more meaningful guild distinction, perhaps based on the
28 classifications in Buechley et al 2015 (i.e. insectivore / granivore / frugivore).
29
30 Our reply: This problem is also solved as we change the analysis to species level in the
31 updated manuscript version.
32

34
35
36 A couple of other fairly major comments are as follows:
37
38 • English was good throughout, up until the discussion, which could use some detailed
39 work simplifying and correcting grammatical errors.
40
41 Our reply: in our updated version, we have improved the language and fix grammatical
42
43 errors.
44
45 • Discussion has several bold claims about coffee forests in Ethiopia that I strongly
46 suggest toning back. This is an interesting study, but I don't think it is definitive enough to
47 say things like “the negative effects of converting natural forest into shade coffee forests on
48
49 bird communities are not dramatic [line 294]”
50
51 Our reply: we agreed and in the new version of our manuscript, we have modified this
52 particular sentence other sentence which appeared to be broad and debatable.

3 Our reply: FA is originally defined as “random deviations from left-right symmetry in
4
5
6 bilateral traits [24-27, reference in the main manuscript]”. To our understanding, from large
7
8 number of the sample size of the given traits, a random sample of the traits potentially can
9
10 reveal the deviation, either as length or weight measurements.

Line 78: What about using other bio-markers like mass?
17
18 Our reply: That is also a possibility and here we used a specific trait, rectrix mass
19
20 Lines 81-82: “the origin and reservoir” – i take issue with the wording here, as arabica also
21 originated and is still found in SW Arabia
22
23 Our reply: To our knowledge, the origin of the coffee arabica is Ethiopia and it crossed the
24
25 red sea to Yeman and other Arabian countries around the 7th century.
26
27 Line 94: tarsi length can be a hard measurement to standardize – perhaps address how this
28 was done in methods
29

31
32 method section on page 7, lines 147 and 148.

52 version of the manuscript, we have tried to explain this further
53
54
55
Line 134: this 80% cutoff seems arbitrary. Could you not find a more well-defined guild
56 separation, perhaps by following the definitions used in Buechley et al 2015?

20
21 Our reply: we fully acknowledge this concern, and we now change our analysis to a species
22
comparison in the two habitat forms rather than guilds.
23
24
25 Lines 154 – 158: I’m a bit skeptical about this method. Retrix feathers are often soiled by
26 feces. Were the feathers cleaned prior to weighing? If so, how? Retrix feathers also undergo
27 major wear. It is not clear to me that tropical birds would necessarily have the same moult
28
29
pattern, thus different individuals may be under different levels of feather wear at any given
30 time, which could impact feather mass. I strongly suggest adding more detail of methods and
31 citations validating these indices here.
32
33 Our reply: we caught 488 individual birds of the ten species included in the previous
34
35 analysis. But our analysis was only fixed to feathers from individuals birds with
36 undamaged/unwearied and clean feathers (this is the reason why our sample size was small
37 for some species). Any feather those soiled with feces/ wearied were not included in the
38
39 analysis page 7, lines 155 and 156.

Comments to the Author(s)
7
8 This study aims to assess avian habitat quality between natural forests and shade coffee
9 plantations in Ethiopia via individual measures of functional asymmetry and feather growth.
10 The overall aim of the study is excellent and attempts to address an area where much work is
11
12 needed. However, I am unable to evaluate the study and thus did not proceed to review the
13 results or discussion for one major reason.
14
15 The paper does not clarify the phenological life history of the 10 study species used. This is
16
crucial because the measures of local site habitat quality are entirely dependent on the
17
18 location of 1) where the measured tarsi were developed as nestlings, and 2) where the
19 measured feathers were grown. For example, if all 10 species were known to breed on site,
20
and it was assumed that the individuals did not disperse to or from elsewhere, then the tarsus
21
22 growth could be assumed to be influenced by the conditions of the study site. However, if the
23 bird was captured after it had migrated from its breeding location elsewhere onto the study
24 site, then the growth differences of the tarsus would reflect the habitat quality or conditions of
25
26 the site where the development took place. It is worrisome, for example, that juveniles were
27 not included in the study even though these would be an example of individuals for which
28 tarsi development location would have been known. Similarly, it is not clarified where the
29
30 rectrices feather growth took place and this is typically different depending on species and
31 age. In first year birds, the rectrices would have grown in on the breeding grounds. If the
32 captured birds were after-first-year adults, the rectrices might have molted in during different
33
34 time periods and at different locations depending on the species. If this information is
35 unknown then the only way to know for certain that a feather was grown at the study site
36 would be to pluck the feather of unknown origin and then pluck the regrown feather from the
37
38 recaptured bird. Thus the feather growth rate would reflect conditions at that specific site and
39 not the location where the original plucked feather was grown.
40
41 It is my assumption that this information was taken into account and it is known but simply
42 not reported. For example, it could be that the ten species are known to breed (and thus
43
44 develop their tarsi) on site. It could be that the species are migrants from another breeding
45 site but they moult rectrices during the time period in which they are captured on site, or they
46 are year round residents and thus perform their moulting cycles on site (and do not move
47
48 between the forest and shade coffee). I am happy to review the paper again if this is the case.
49 However, if this type of information is unavailable then I am afraid it is impossible to know
50 whether the tarsi and feather measures reflect what the authors assume they reflect.
51
52
Our reply: We ring birds for more than three years in this particular study sites and we never
53
54 come across individual birds those move from one fragment to another. Individual birds were
55 caught first as immature later as adult rewrap in the same sites year after years. From this we
56
conclude most of the birds born and grow on the same sites, and not migrate from one forest
57
58 to other. We have this experience from our previous study on bird species richness, diversity

32
33 Line 27 and 28, I suggest making explicitly clear the two step assumption and prediction
34
here, which then leads to your final indirect assumption (prediction):
35
36 1. You assume (presumably based on previous work that will be detailed in the text) that
37 higher FA and narrower feather growth bars indicate comparatively lower Habitat Quality,
38 and
39 2. You predict lower habitat quality in shade coffee vs. natural forest (as indicated by higher
40 FA and narrower growth bars).

48
49 Line 28 page 2, I think I understand what you are getting at here, but perhaps add a sentence
50
or a few words to clarify. The reader might wonder why it is suggested that these habitats be
51
52 converted to shade coffee vs. restored to healthy forests. So adding something about degraded
53 forests being converted into shade coffee as compensation for lost coffee production due to
54 forest protection would clarify. Also, is shade coffee considered to be of higher quality than
55 degraded forest?

Line 53, I made a few suggestions for how to tone down this statement. There has been
29 evidence presented, as the introduction suggests, that remnant forest and shade coffee are
30 comparable in terms of these bird measures, but I would not go so far to state “no negative
31 effect” because the story is more nuanced. There are several examples where shade coffee
32 measures of bird species richness, etc, were lower than native forest remnants (and this
33 should be noted). For example, see this review and citations therein:
34 Komar. 2006. Ecology and conservation of birds in coffee plantations: a critical review. Bird
35
36
Conservation International 16:1-23:
37
38 “As expected, bird species-richness and diversity in shaded coffee plantations tend to be
39 lower than in nearby forest patches (Terborgh and Weske 1969, Beehler et al. 1987, Thiollay
40 1995, Wunderle and Latta 1996, Estrada et al. 1997, Greenberg et al. 1997a, Petit et al. 1999),
41 although studies in some landscapes have documented the same or even higher species
42
richness as natural forest (Aguilar- Ortiz 1982, Greenberg et al. 1997b, Shahabuddin 1997,
43
44 Tejeda-Cruz and Sutherland 2004). Species diversity in shaded plantations is nearly always
45 reported to be considerably higher than in open-sun plantations or other types of monoculture
46 (Beehler et al. 1987, Wunderle and Latta 1996, Estrada et al. 1997, González 1999, Petit et al.

36
37 Our reply: Our study species were resident, stay round in a site where they were captured.
38
39 Feather growth and moult were takes place in the same sites (in our study sites). These
40 species do not migrate from one forest fragment to the other. Even if we made many years

42
43
44
Line 160, Again. This procedure completely depends on when these feathers were grown.
45 Are these birds year round residents of their various plots and therefore the feather growth
46 reflects the conditions of that habitat? Or, are any of these birds migrants that only use the
47 study sites during a certain time period? Do they occupy the sites when rectrices molt occurs?
48 If the feathers grow in offsite, then the growth bars do not represent the quality of the habitat
49 in question.
50
Our reply: Bird species of our study are resident and stay year round in sampling sites.
51
52 Previous work of Buechley et al., 2015 have showed that these bird species have breeding

Appendix D
Fluctuating asymmetry and feather growth bars as biomarkers to assess habitat
quality of shade coffee farming for avian diversity conservation
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I am happy to once again review this paper which aims to compare avian habitat quality
between shade coffee and nearby natural forests in Ethiopia. The paper is an important
contribution in that unlike most studies of this sort, it aims to compare biomarkers rather
than community measures. Both approaches are important, but as the authors note,
occupancy alone is not always the best measure of habitat quality.
This version and the author responses addressed my major concern from my previous review.
I also agreed with the primary comment of the 2nd reviewer that it is more appropriate to
compare these biomarkers between habitat types within the same species, rather than
between guilds.
Our reply: Thanks. Yes, we also found this comment very constructive and did the change
accordingly.
The reworked paper is much sounder, though I recommend that a major revision is still
needed. I think that all of the pieces are here (in terms of the data, the design, and the
statistical analysis) to present a simple but important result, but I am afraid that the
grammar and writing make the story more complicated than it needs to be. I think it would be
very helpful for the authors to request assistance from a copy editor. I am very familiar with
the general topic of the paper, thus with some effort I was able to decipher what the paper
was explicitly attempting to convey. I fear that readers less familiar with the topic will not be
able to do so. I provided a few comments and suggestions for sentences where I found this to
be especially true, but I would recommend a thorough check on both grammar and sentence
structure so that the primary message is conveyed more clearly.

Our reply: In our resubmitted version, we incorporate all changes suggested by the
reviewers and improve the language and presentation in general.
I am not familiar with the details of analysis of FA, but I think that too much detail of this
analysis is provided in the results section. The main aim of the paper is to compare habitat
quality (via biomarkers) between the two habitat types; I suggest leading the results section
with this result. As it currently stands, this main result is not addressed until the end of the
second paragraph.
Our reply: That is true, and we also noticed a bit complex presentation for the result section
in other published papers focused on the FA. This is mainly due to the need of clarifying the
validity of several parameters in the result section before providing the final conclusion of the
FA. In our updated manuscript, we slightly modify the language and presentation but keeps
the analysis which are needed to show the validity of the data.
In reference to a comment from my previous review, the authors stated that they addressed
this in the discussion, however this version does not contain any mention of this in the
discussion. I actually suggest that this instead be briefly addressed in the methods instead.
The original comment was: “No need to go into an exhaustive review of these two measures,
but since the entire study is based on FA and feather growth, it would help the reader to have
a bit more justification for the validity of the methods. Please more explicitly explain the links
between FA and Feather Growth to fundamental life history components.
Our reply: we misunderstood the comment in our previous revision, and emphasis the need
of combining the two methods in the discussion. We now include the validity and links
between FA and Feather Growth to fundamental life history components in the introduction
as follow,
While there are exceptions <U+F05B>32<U+F05D>, studies have shown that asymmetric individuals
exhibit lower fitness affecting populations in the long term [33-37].
For example, in a study of Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica), Møller [38] reported a
significant increase in male tail feather FA in birds captured in Chernobyl after the 1986
nuclear accident compared to pre-1986 museum specimens from the same site. Furthermore,
2
Møller [38] indicated that more asymmetric males of this species bred later than symmetric
ones. Also, birds living in low quality sites (food less abundant) are expected to show
narrower growth bars than birds in sites with higher food availability [28,29,39]. Carlson [39]
demonstrated a positive correlation between feather growth bar widths with food availability
in the territories of White-backed Woodpeckers (Dendrocopos leucotos). Although the use of
growth bars as an index of nutritional condition in wild birds seems plausible and has been
used in many studies [e.g. 28, 39–41], others have criticized the validity of this technique for
the lack of precision [42,43].
Also, what do you think about the criticisms of ptilochronology? (for example, see citations
below). Again, no need for too much detail but please add in a few more clarifying sentences
to make the life history links and very briefly address the criticisms of Murphy.
Murphy and King. 1991. Ptilochronology: a critical evaluation of assumptions and utility.
The Auk 108:695-704
Murphy. 1992. Ptilochronology: accuracy and reliability of the technique. The Auk 109:676-
680.”
Our reply: That is correct, and we briefly mentioned the controversial criticisms of
ptilochronology in the introduction section as stated above
Finally, I see that the paper does link to the Dryad Digital Repository. However, this is done
in the literature cited section and I just happened to run across it. I don't believe the citation
(#77) is referred to anywhere in the text. This is the reason that I checked "no" for the two
questions pertaining to the accessibility of the supporting data. I recommend making this link
more clear by adding it as a supplement or mentioning it in the acknowledgements.
Our reply: We have now incorporated the citation to the Data accessibility section
“Data accessibility: Data available at the Dryard Digital Repository [87]”
I am happy to review this paper again.

Our reply: Thanks you for your constructive comments and your interest in improving the
manuscript further
Reviewer one (Comments here are Copied from the PDF file)
1. Line 19: The English could use some work in the abstract; I have provided a few
suggestions.
Our reply: we have now incorporated all comments as suggested here and substantially
improve the language across the manuscript.
2. Line 20: Shouldn't this be ..."combining sustainable coffee production and biodiversity
conservation"?
Our reply: we did the change as suggested
3. Line 22: Correct and clarify the language here. These indicators don't have "negative
effects" as indicators for habitat quality. I think what you are trying to say is that indices
such as abundance and diversity are not always good indicators of habitat quality,
because lower quality individuals may be occupying a site only because they have been
pushed out of higher quality sites by dominant or higher quality individuals. Seek a way
to explain this more clearly. -or simply, "indices such as diversity and abundance are
not always good indicators of habitat quality" would suffice (and then back up a bit in
the intro with citations).
Our reply: However, diversity and abundance are not always good indicators of habitat
quality because there may be a lag before population effects are observed following habitat
conversion. Therefore other indicators of habitat quality should be tested. In this paper, we
investigate the use of two biomarkers: fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of tarsus length and
rectrix mass, and feather growth bars (average growth bar width) to characterise habitat
quality of shade coffee and natural forests.
4. Line 26: For clarity, I suggest separating these sentences and rewording to something
such as "...width) as indicators of habitat quality. We predicted higher FA and narrower
feather growth bars in shade coffee versus natural forest, indicating higher quality in the
latter."
4
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
5. Line 28: Insert “FA and feather growth in”.
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
6. Line 29: Delete “for tarsus length and rectrix mass”
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
7. Line 29: Replace “both” by shade coffee and natural forest
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
8. Line 30: Delete “traits”
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
9. Line 30: Replace “showed no difference” with “was not different”
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
10. Line 31: Replace “no difference was found in growth bar widths in any of these species
between shade coffee and natural forest” by “we found no difference in feather growth
between shade coffee and natural forests for any species”
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
11. Line 34: Replace “avian conservation” by “avian conservation for the species we
examined”
Our reply: We did the change as suggested
5
12. Line 37: Introduction section, Also work on English grammar in the introduction.
Our reply: We did the change as suggested
13. Line 50: Delete “it has been concluded that”
Our reply: We did the change as suggested
14. Line 50: Replace “play” by “be”
Our reply: We did the change as suggested
15. Line 51: Replace role by tool for
Our reply: We did the change as suggested
16. Line 51: Delete when combining and replace by in
Our reply: We did the change as suggested
17. Line 56: clarify: long term effects of what?
Our reply: We have clarified this in the introduction section as follow
“demographic changes in the distribution of sex or age classes, changes in rates of survival or
reproduction, which results from biotic changes, are possibly long-term effects. Demographic
changes are unlikely to be picked up by community-level studies on demography and a-
diversity alone if surveys are done shortly after natural forests have been transformed into
shade coffee forests”
18. Line 56: What are "these" referring to?
Our reply: "these" is to referring demographic changes, and we now clarify it in the
updated manuscript version
6
19. Line 69: Please correct grammar here.
Our reply: Okay, we have now corrected the grammar as follow
Two potential useful biomarkers are fluctuating asymmetry (FA), i.e. measuring small
random deviations from left-right symmetry in bilateral traits [24-27] and feather growth
bars, i.e., measuring width of alternating dark and light growth-bars on bird feathers
[ptilochronology, 28-31].
20. Line 125: Please include a sentence or two here describing why you selected these 5
species.
Our replay: In the current version we addressed this as follows
The bird species included were chosen if 1) they represented a breeding population in our
study area, and 2) their sample sizes from both forest types were adequate and comparable.
These criteria were met by five species: Abyssinian Ground Thrush, Rüppell’s Robin-chat,
Grey-backed Camaroptera, African dusky Flycatcher and Tambourine Dove (Table 1).
Line 134: delete 351
Our reply: We have made the change
24. Line 134: Presumably you captured more than 5 species. This might be the a good
place to explain why you selected the 5 (as suggested above)
Our reply: We addressed why we selected five species for two reasons as mentioned above.
26. Line 137: change the place
Our reply: we did the changes accordingly
7
21. Line 138: Replace “aged, weighted” to “and aged and weighed them”
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
22. Line 147: Replace “Tarsi length”, by “We measured tarsi length as the”
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
23. Line 149: delete “was measured in the field to the nearest 0.1 mm using Vernier
callipers” Already stated above.
Our reply: we now deleted the sentence as suggested
24. Line 151: Delete “The second outer most right and left rectrices (fully-grown) rectrices
feathers were collected from every bird captured for rectrix mass and growth bar
measurements [33]”. Already stated above.
Our reply: the sentence is now deleted
27. Line 153: replace “the” by collected
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
25. Line 158: Replace “follow” by “follows”
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
26. Line 183: Data analysis “I don't think it is necessary to separate these out into different
subsections. Combine and reduce repeated wording when necessary”
Our reply: Yes, we also have tried to make the analysis part reduced and with of no
subsection. This however makes the readers a bit confusing as the FA statistical
analysis is not straightforward and needs several analysis as validity testing before the
8
final analysis of FA. Hence, we prefer to keep it separated unless the reviewer fined it
really important to make it without subsections.
27. Line 185: Delete Individual signed
Our reply: We did the change accordingly
28. Line 187: For clarity, I suggest referring to "unsigned FA" instead as "absolute FA" -
which is a clearer description of this measure.
Our reply: Across the published materials of FA, unsigned FA is the most common word
and we prefer to keep it, but we also mention absolute value in this sentence for clarity.
29. Line 187: Replace “Individual unsigned FA (the magnitude of signed FA) values were
the absolute values of signed FA” by “We then calculated the absolute value of
differences in measurements (absolute FA) to describe the magnitude of FA”.
Our reply: We have made the change accordingly, except we mention unsigned FA in the
bracket as this is the word used across the published materials in FA studies
30. Line 194: Please clarify this. I think you mean that you used random intercepts for side
nested within individual id (which would make the most sense).
Our reply: we learn the reviewer find it okay in his/her latter comment, line197.
31. Line 225: Not knowing much about FA comparisons, it is not clear to me that these sorts
of details are necessary or not. Even so, the reader is much more interested in the
comparison between the two habitat types, then the statistical details of normality, etc. I
suggest declaring the most interesting results first and following up with detail in the
next, or relegating those to the tables.
Our reply: We agree on the reviewer comment here on the long descriptions of method and
analysis section before the main analysis which determines the presence or absence of the
FA. Unlike most of other studies, the FA is very much dependent on analysis of the validity
9
which makes FA papers a bit long and not easy to read. Yet, we have tried to clearly show the
validity of the data to be used for the FA analysis. We prefer to keep it like this unless we get
the reviewer find the change is really important.
32. Line 228: Why is Kurtosis being highlighted here? Is this a measure that is important
for comparing FA? If so, please describe earlier.
Our reply: It was highlighted in our previous submission by mistake, and we now have
corrected it.
33. Line 241: This is the result that should be highlighted first. Also, because "all species" is
used, no need to list all 5 of them again.
Our reply: Yes, we deleted the list of the five species. For the reason we have mentioned
above, the test of the validity of the data for FA analysis, we prefer to keep them as they
were.
34. Line 244: I think what is meant here is that there were no significant differences (not
significant when using alpha = 0.5) between measures from different forest types for any
species, but there was a tendency for absolute FA to be higher in shade coffee than in
natural forests for 3 species. I would be more explicit about this. As this is now written,
the two results seem to contradict each other. It took me a few reads to realize that you
were simply saying that there tended to be a difference, even though it was not a
statistically significant difference.
Our reply: That is right. We now mentioned the differences as in spite of the lack of a
significant difference. But in the current version, we have tried to improve the presentation to
make this clear.
37. Line 247: same as the pervious comment.
Our reply: same as above
10
35. Line 253: Again, perhaps reword this (as suggested in previous comment) to highlight
the trends observed (even if they were not statistically significant).
Our reply: We now make change accordingly.
36. Line 263: delete “based on demographic studies”
Our reply: Our study of the effect of shade coffee is different from the previous study
because of our approach using biomarkers while previous studies used demographic studies,
diversity and abundance. We still think mentioning this aspect is important.
37. Line 266: delete including in forest species.
Our reply: we did the change as suggested
38. Line 269: negatively affected by what?
Our reply: we now make it clear; it is by modification of forest to shade coffee
39. Line 271: Replace “Currently, in our study area, the negative effects of shade coffee
farming is not evident in any of the bird species” by Based on the biomarkers we
compared, it appears that shade coffee farms and natural forests are of similar quality
for the five species we examined.
Our reply: we did the change as suggested

3 15 Abstract
4
5
6 16 Shade coffee farming has been promoted as a means of combining sustainable coffee
7
8 17 production and biodiversity conservation. Supporting this idea, similar levels of diversity and
9
10 18 abundance of birds have been found in shade coffee and natural forests. However, diversity
11
12
13
19 and abundance are not always good indicators of habitat quality because there may be a lag
14
15 20 before population effects are observed following habitat conversion. Therefore other
16
17 21 indicators of habitat quality should be tested. In this paper, we investigate the use of two
18
19
22 biomarkers: fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of tarsus length and rectrix mass, and feather growth
20
21
22 23 bars (average growth bar width) to characterise habitat quality of shade coffee and natural
23
24 24 forests. We predicted higher FA and narrower feather growth bars in shade coffee forest
25
26 25 versus natural forest, indicating higher quality in the latter. We measured and compared FA
27
28
29 26 in tarsus length and rectrix mass and average growth bar width in more than 200 individuals
30
31 27 of five bird species. The extent of FA in both tarsus length and rectrix mass was not different
32
33 28 between the two forest types in any of the five species. Similarly, we found no difference in
34
35
36
29 feather growth between shade coffee and natural forests for any species. Therefore, we
37
38 30 conclude that shade coffee farming in Afrotropical rain forests of Ethiopia seems to have no
39
40 31 negative consequences on avian populations for the species we examined.

3 35 1. Introduction
4
5
6
36 Tropical forests host at least two-thirds of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity and offer a wide
7
8 37 range of ecosystem services [1]. However, these forests are shrinking at unprecedented rates
9
10 38 [2,3]. Agricultural practices compatible with forest conservation have been proposed as a
11
12
39 potential strategy to slow down, stop or even reverse the current alarming rate of
13
14
15 40 deforestation [4].
16
17 41 Shade coffee farming, i.e. growing coffee beneath the canopy of shade trees, has
18
19 42 recently gained support as a form of agricultural practice that is, at least partly, more
20
21
22 43 compatible with biodiversity conservation than other agricultural practices [5-7]. However,
23
24 44 the results of various studies testing this notion are contradictory. For instance, species
25
26 45 richness, abundance and community composition of birds in shade coffee forests have been
27
28
29 46 shown to be similar to those in natural forests in some studies <U+F05B>8-10<U+F05D>, but not in others<U+F05B>11-
30
31 47 14<U+F05D>. But compared to nearby open-sun plantation, bird species diversity in shade coffee
32
33
48 forests is notably higher <U+F05B>9,12,13<U+F05D>. Therefore, shade coffee farming might be an important
34
35
36 49 method to preserve biodiversity in agro-forestry systems [15,16].
37
38 50 These studies imply that populations inhabiting shade coffee forests likely also share
39
40
51 equal prospects for reproduction or/and long-term survival with their conspecifics residing in
41
42
43 52 pristine forests [17,18]. However, more subtle effects on populations may have been
44
45 53 overlooked so far, including demographic changes in the distribution of sex or age classes or
46
47 54 changes in rates of survival or reproduction. Such demographic changes are unlikely to be
48
49
50 55 identified by community-level studies on demography and a-diversity alone if surveys are
51
52 56 done soon after natural forests have been transformed into shade coffee forests. Communities
53
54 57 can be affected without any noticeable change in diversity and abundance due to time lags in
55
56
57
58 responses or immigration from nearby source populations [19,20]. To overcome these issues
58
59 59 a growing number of studies applied phenotypic or physiological proxies of fitness
60

Page 5 of 31 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 60 (biomarkers), such as body size, body mass, fat-free mass, or the rate or precision of growth.
4
5
6 61 These markers are all thought to be able to indicate stress (e.g. nutritional stress), and thus
7
8 62 relative levels of habitat quality <U+F05B>21,22<U+F05D>. Stress-mediated changes should preferably be
9
10
63 detectable before direct components of fitness are compromised (see [23] for a list of criteria
11
12
13 64 to evaluate biomarkers). Most importantly in a conservation context, collecting such data
14
15 65 should not involve lethal sampling, exhaustive training or expensive equipment.
16
17 66 Two potential useful biomarkers are fluctuating asymmetry (FA), i.e. measuring small
18
19
20 67 random deviations from left-right symmetry in bilateral traits [24-27] and feather growth
21
22 68 bars, i.e., measuring width of alternating dark and light growth-bars on bird feathers
23
24 69 [ptilochronology, 28-31]. While there are exceptions <U+F05B>32<U+F05D>, studies have shown that
25
26
27 70 asymmetric individuals exhibit lower fitness affecting populations in the long term [33-37].
28
29 71 For example, in a study of Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica), Møller [38] reported a
30
31 72 significant increase in male tail feather FA in birds captured in Chernobyl after the 1986
32
33
34
73 nuclear accident compared to pre-1986 museum specimens from the same site. Furthermore,
35
36 74 Møller [38] indicated that more asymmetric males of this species bred later than symmetric
37
38 75 ones. Also, birds living in low quality sites (food less abundant) are expected to show
39
40
76 narrower growth bars than birds in sites with higher food availability [28,29,39]. Carlson [39]
41
42
43 77 demonstrated a positive correlation between feather growth bar widths with food availability
44
45 78 in the territories of White-backed Woodpeckers (Dendrocopos leucotos). Although the use of
46
47 79 growth bars as an index of nutritional condition in wild birds seems plausible and has been
48
49
50 80 used in many studies [e.g. 28, 39–41], others have criticized the validity of this technique for
51
52 81 the lack of precision [42,43].
53
54 82 The benefits of these markers are based on their ease, low cost, non-lethality during the
55
56
57
83 measurement process, and their link to fundamental life-history components that are
58
59 84 otherwise more laborious to measure [44]. When applied in tandem [45,46], they provide an

2
3 85 overall, integrated picture of environmental and nutritional stress effects [21], which in turn
4
5
6 86 can provide information on habitat quality.
7
8 87 Ethiopian coffee mainly grows in tropical rainforest remnants belonging to the Eastern
9
10 88 Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. This hotspot is known for its exceptionally high level of
11
12
13
89 biodiversity and endemicity [47]. The respective forests are also the origin and reservoir of
14
15 90 wild Coffea arabica [48,49]. Buechley et al. [50] showed that bird diversity in shade coffee
16
17 91 forests in SW Ethiopia did not significantly differ from that of ecologically comparable
18
19
92 natural moist evergreen Afromontane forests in the same region. The forests used for coffee
20
21
22 93 production actually hosted more than twice the number of species than the latter. While all
23
24 94 bird species recorded in primary forest control sites were also recorded in shade coffee
25
26 95 forests, shade coffee plots showed a lower abundance of forest specialists and understorey
27
28
29 96 insectivores. The authors concluded that, while Ethiopian shade coffee farming is perhaps the
30
31 97 most "bird-friendly" coffee in the world, the little-disturbed forest remains critical for
32
33 98 sustaining at-risk groups of birds, such as forest specialist birds [50].
34
35
36
99 To determine whether populations of forest-dependent species that currently persist in
37
38 100 Ethiopian shade coffee forest show signs of increased environmental and/or nutritional stress
39
40 101 compared to conspecifics from natural forests, we revisited a subset of the study plots
41
42
102 sampled by Buechley et al. [50] and measured FA of two phenotypic traits (length of tarsi
43
44
45 103 and mass of the second outermost rectrices) and feather growth bars of the second outermost
46
47 104 rectrices in 319 individuals belonging to five species. We hypothesised that if shade coffee is
48
49 105 of lower quality than natural forests we would observe higher FA and lower feather growth
50
51
52 106 rates (i.e., narrower feather growth bars) in birds from shade coffee forests as compared to
53
54 107 birds from undisturbed forests. Studying both traits allowed us to assess possible adverse
55
56 108 effects of shade coffee farming during different stages of life. Since tarsi are already fully
57
58
59
109 grown before fledging, this measure provides information on stress during the nestling period

4
5
6 111 the other hand, rectrices are moulted throughout adult life, providing information on stress at
7
8 112 a particular time of the adult individuals’ life-history.

114 2. Materials and method
14
15 115 2.1 Study site
16
17 116 The study was conducted in south-western Ethiopia at three sites in the shade coffee farming
18
19
117 area (422 km2): Fetche, Garuke, and Yebu, and at four natural forest sites in the Belete-Gera
20
21
22 118 Forest (920 km2): Afalo, Abana Buna, Qacho, and Muje (Fig. 1).
23
24 119 In the shade coffee production scheme, the forest was modified from the original forest
25
26 120 to improve the productivity of coffee plants by reducing tree and shrub density. This leads to
27
28
29 121 obvious differences in the vegetation density and canopy cover compared to the natural
30
31 122 forest. In the shade coffee areas, seedling density, stem density and crown cover of
32
33 123 indigenous trees were 3000 ha-1, 655 ha-1 and 79%, respectively, whereas in natural forests
34
35
36
124 respective values were 10,000 ha-1, 952 ha-1 and 86.7% [58].
37
38 125 The Belete-Gera Forest is one of the largest remaining tracts of forest in south-western
39
40 126 Ethiopia. It is a typical Afromontane evergreen forest, dominated by tree species like
41
42
127 Syzigium guineense, Olea welwitchii, Prunus africana and Pouteria adolfi-friederici, with
43
44
45 128 over 157 plant species representing 69 families and 135 genera <U+F05B><U+F035><U+F039><U+F02C><U+F036><U+F030>]. Its animal diversity
46
47 129 has never been thoroughly studied, but during a one month pilot study, 25 mammal, 16
48
49
50
130 amphibian, 5 reptile, 126 bird and 87 butterfly species have been identified [61]. The forest is
51
52 131 considered as a regional forest priority area and “Key Biodiversity Area” (KBA).
53
54 132 Nevertheless, deforestation and habitat modification for shade coffee farming continues in the
55
56
133 region.

3 135 2.2 Study species
4
5
6 136 The bird species included were chosen if 1) they represented a breeding population in our
7
8 137 study area, and 2) their sample sizes from both forest types were adequate and comparable.
9
10 138 These criteria were met by five species: Abyssinian Ground Thrush, Rüppell’s Robin-chat,
11
12
13
139 Grey-backed Camaroptera, African dusky Flycatcher and Tambourine Dove (Table 1). Based
14
15 140 on their primary habitat utilization, the first two species were considered forest species while
16
17 141 the latter three species were considered non-forest species [62,68]. Based on their diet
18
19
142 Rüppell’s Robin-chat, Grey-backed Camaroptera and African dusky Flycatcher were
20
21
22 143 regarded as insectivorous, the Abyssinian Ground Thrush as omnivorous and the Tambourine
23
24 144 Dove as granivorous <U+F05B>69<U+F05D>. These species are residents in the study area [70], comprising
25
26
27
145 breeding populations [50].
28
29 146
30
31 147 2.3 Data collection
32
33
148 From December 2013 to June 2015, we captured 1070 individuals of 64 bird species using
34
35
36 149 mist-netting procedures. We retrieved measures of tarsus length from 319 birds, and
37
38 150 measures of rectrix mass and average growth bar width from 223 individuals of our five
39
40 151 species (Table 1). We opened the nets 30 minutes before sunrise and kept them open for six
41
42
43 152 hours. We checked the nets routinely at 30-min intervals to remove birds without holding
44
45 153 them unnecessarily. Upon capture, we 1) ringed each individual bird with rings from National
46
47 154 Museum of Kenya, and aged and weighed them (to the nearest 0.01g using digital balance),
48
49
50
155 2) measured tarsus length (to the nearest 0.1 mm with Vernier callipers), and wing length (to
51
52 156 the nearest 0.5 mm using wing ruler), and 3) plucked the second outermost (the fifth) of right
53
54 157 and left rectrices feathers from individual captured birds. We released the birds immediately
55
56
158 after we collected feather samples and took the measurements on the spot.

3 160 2.3.1 Measurement of tarsi length and rectrix mass
4
5
6 161 Fluctuating asymmetry was determined from two traits, tarsi length and rectrix mass.
7
8 162 Different traits have different susceptibility for FA based on cost of growth of the trait,
9
10 163 defined as the amount of structural components necessary to form a unit of length of a given
11
12
13
164 character [71] hence we used both traits. We measured tarsi length as the distance from the
14
15 165 back of inter-tarsal joint to the point where the toes bending an angle of 90 degree to the
16
17 166 tarsus [72]. Two independent measurements of right and left tarsus lengths for each
18
19
167 individual (sequence right-left-right-left or left-right-left-right) were taken. Collected feathers
20
21
22 168 were stored in separately labelled dry paper envelopes and transported to the laboratory, and
23
24 169 the rectrices were weighted twice using an analytical balance to the nearest 0.1 mg. Tarsi
25
26 170 with anomalies were not measured, and rectrices with damaged tips or soiled with faeces
27
28
29 171 were not collected.
30
31 172
32
33 173 2.3.2 Measurement of growth bar widths
34
35
36
174 Growth bar widths and total feather lengths were measured by one of us (GG) as follows: (1)
37
38 175 each unwearied feather was pinned on separate, white, polystyrene boards and total feather
39
40 176 length was measured to the nearest 0.01 mm with a digital calliper. (2) Each feather was
41
42
177 marked at a distance of 7/10 from its proximal end, and the proximate and distal ends of 5
43
44
45 178 consecutive growth bars were marked with ultrafine mounting pins. (3) Each marked board
46
47 179 was scanned (Oce OP1130) and growth bar widths and total feather lengths were
48
49 180 automatically measured with an image-analysis-software (KS400 Zeiss). The entire
50
51
52 181 procedure was repeated for 66 randomly selected feathers to assess the repeatability of our
53
54 182 measurements.

3 185 2.4 Data validation
4
5
6 186 Possible data outliers were detected using Cook distance (Cookd) (in SAS) to ensure data
7
8 187 quality for all measurements (tarsus length, feather mass, feather length, and average growth
9
10 188 bar widths), whereby outliers were removed from the data.
11
12
13
189 The level of repeatability for the growth bar widths was calculated according to Lessells
14
15 190 and Boag [73], whereby within-group and between group mean squares were obtained from
16
17 191 one-way ANOVAs, and significance was assessed using F-tests. Repeatability estimates were
18
19
192 high, both for total feather length (right trait side: r = 0.999, N = 66, P = <0.001; left trait
20
21
22 193 side: r = 0.999, N = 66, P < 0.001) and for average growth bar widths (right trait side: r =
23
24 194 0.992, N = 66, P < 0.000; left trait side: r = 0.983, N = 66, P < 0.001).
25
26 195 Since the residuals of the measured traits (unsigned FA values for tarsus length and
27
28
29 196 rectrix mass) deviated from normal (Shapiro-Wilk test; see Table S1), the data were
30
31 197 transformed using Box-Cox transformation to meet normality assumptions before further
32
33 198 analysis.

37
38 200 2.5 Data analyses
39
40 201 2.5.1 Analysis of fluctuating asymmetry
41
42
202 We quantified individual signed FA for tarsus length and rectrix mass as the difference in
43
44
45 203 measures between right (R) and left (L) tarsi (using average values obtained from the two
46
47 204 replicated measurements of each side) [74]. We then calculated the absolute values of
48
49 205 differences in measurements (unsigned FA) to describe the magnitude of FA.
50
51
52 206 Following Van Dongen et al. [75], the levels of significance of signed FA and its
53
54 207 repeatability in the measured traits were calculated by the restricted maximum likelihood
55
56 208 (REML) estimation of a mixed regression model where we fitted the models to the repeated
57
58
59
209 measurements of right and left trait sides [75]. We included sides as fixed effects in the
60
9
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 11 of 31 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 210 models and measured trait values (tarsi lengths or rectrix masses) as response variables, bird
4
5
6 211 id and sides as a random effect. This procedure allows the separation of measurement error
7
8 212 (ME) from bilateral asymmetry analysis [75]. The presence of directional asymmetry (DA)
9
10 213 was assessed by the F-test of the fixed effects, with degrees of freedom corrected for
11
12
13
214 statistical dependence by Satterthwaite formulas [76]. We used random intercepts and slopes
14
15 215 (both estimated within individuals) to estimate the variation in individual trait value and the
16
17 216 individual signed FA, respectively, while the random error variance component gave the
18
19
217 measurement error. The significance of FA was then calculated by performing a likelihood
20
21
22 218 ratio (LR) test comparing two models: the original, full model and a reduced model without
23
24 219 the side (left or right) as a random effect. Then, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were
25
26 220 calculated to evaluate the repeatability of FA [75].
27
28
29 221 Absence of anti-symmetry, i.e. a type of asymmetry that occurs in a random direction,
30
31 222 producing a bimodal distribution over the population, was verified by testing the signed FA
32
33 223 for normal distribution.
34
35
36
224
37
38 225 2.5.2 Analysis of unsigned FA
39
40 226 The linear mixed model was fitted to the data to test whether unsigned FA levels in tarsus
41
42
227 length and rectrix mass differed between birds of shade coffee forests and birds of natural
43
44
45 228 forests whereby unsigned FA was included as a response variable, forest type as a fixed effect
46
47 229 and sampling location as a random effect.
48
49 230 Model selection was done using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for the species
50
51
52 231 with moderate sample sizes (Rüppell’s Robin-chat and Tambourine Dove). For the species
53
54 232 with small sample sizes (Abyssinian Ground Thrush, Grey-backed Camaroptera, and African
55
56 233 Dusky Flycatcher), model selection was done using AICc (the form of AIC corrected for
57
58
59
234 small sample size).

4
5
6 236 To test whether average growth bar widths differed between birds of shade coffee forests and
7
8 237 those of natural forests, we added average growth bar widths in the models as a response
9
10 238 variable, forest type as fixed effect and total feather lengths as fixed covariate, and sampling
11
12
13
239 location as a random effect. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.4.,
14
15 240 SAS Institute 2013, Cary, NC, USA).
16
17 241
18
19
242 3. Results
20
21
22 243 We obtained measures of tarsus length from 319 individuals, and measures of rectrix mass
23
24 244 and average growth bar width from 223 individuals (Table 1). For tarsus length, kurtosis
25
26 245 ranged from K = 0.33 in Tambourine Dove to K = 6.82 in Abyssinian Ground Thrush, for
27
28
29 246 rectrix mass, it ranged from K = 3.551 in Abyssinian Ground Thrush to K = 24.75 in
30
31 247 Tambourine Dove (Table S1). The signed FA distribution was leptokurtic for both tarsus
32
33 248 length and rectrix mass in the Abyssinian Ground Thrush, African dusky Flycatcher and
34
35
36
249 Grey-backed Camaroptera, but for rectrix mass only in Rüppell’s Robin-chat and Tambourine
37
38 250 Dove (K>3.0) (Shapiro Wilk test; all P < 0.03; Table S1), which indicates heterogeneity in
39
40 251 developmental stability between individuals <U+F05B><U+F037><U+F035><U+F02C><U+F037><U+F037>]. DA was detected for tarsus length (P <
41
42
43 252 0.001), but not for rectrix mass (P < 0.1; Table S2).
44
45 253
46
47 254 3.1 Fluctuating asymmetry
48
49
50
255 The signed FA variance estimation was highly significant relative to measurement error in
51
52 256 both tarsus length (<U+F063>2 = 789.7, df = 1, P < 0.0001) and rectrix mass (<U+F063>2 = 449.1, df = 1, P <
53
54 257 0.0001) (Table S2). But, the level of within-side measurement error was high compared to
55
56
57
258 between-side difference in both traits (tarsus: ICC = 22.3 % and rectrix mass: ICC = 2.5 * 10-
58
259 5). Furthermore, the level of unsigned FA both in tarsus length and rectrix mass did not differ
59
60
11
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 13 of 31 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 260 between natural forests and shade coffee forests for all species (all: P = 0.0521; Table 2 & 3).
4
5
6 261 Although not significant, Abyssinian Ground Thrush, African dusky Flycatcher, and
7
8 262 Tambourine Dove demonstrated higher FA both in tarsus length and rectrix mass in shade
9
10 263 coffee than their conspecifics in natural forest (Fig. 2 a & b). Again, although not significant,
11
12
13
264 Rüppell's Robin-chat showed higher FA only in tarsus length in shade coffee forests.
14
15 265
16
17 266 3.2 Growth bar width
18
19
267 Average growth bar width of the five species did not differ between shade coffee and natural
20
21
22 268 forests (all species: P = 0.1; Table 4). Furthermore, mean rectrix length did not vary between
23
24 269 shade coffee and natural forests (all species: P = 0.2 ; Table S3). Tambourine Doves showed
25
26 270 a tendency for wider average growth bar in the natural forests, whereas Grey-backed
27
28
29 271 Camaroptera showed narrower growth bar in the natural forest (Fig. 3).
30
31 272
32
33 273 4. Discussion
34
35
36
274 Several studies based on species richness, abundance and community composition have
37
38 275 revealed that shade coffee farming can have an important role in biodiversity conservation [8-
39
40 276 10,15,16]. Yet, the intensification of coffee management necessitates further monitoring of
41
42
277 habitat quality in shade coffee farms with methods that can detect changes before the habitat
43
44
45 278 quality is degraded to such an extent that it affects avian community demography [40,78,79].
46
47 279 Here, we applied biomarkers to re-assess the quality of Ethiopian tropical rain forest used for
48
49 280 shade coffee farming which has previously been reported to support as rich avian biodiversity
50
51
52 281 as natural forest based on demographic studies [50].
53
54 282 FA in both traits (tarsus length and rectrix mass) were not significantly different in
55
56 283 birds from shade coffee or natural forests. Similarly, the analysis of feather growth bar widths
57
58
59
284 revealed no significant difference between birds of the two forest types. Our results are in
60
12
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 14 of 31
1
2
3 285 contrast to Buechley et al. [50] who reported that forest specialist guilds and understory-
4
5
6 286 insectivores were more negatively affected than birds of other guilds in shade coffee when
7
8 287 compared to those in natural forest.
9
10 288 Based on the biomarkers we compared, it appears that shade coffee farms and natural
11
12
13
289 forests are of similar quality for the five species we examined. Yet, the long-term impact of
14
15 290 the on-going shade coffee plantation modification and management should still be closely
16
17 291 monitored. Shade coffee farm management, involving the selective removal of certain tree
18
19
292 species, may decrease habitat quality of shade coffee plantation for avian biodiversity [5,80].
20
21
22 293 In many coffee growing countries across the globe, shade coffee management practices are
23
24 294 intensifying, which is believed to be reducing plant diversity and canopy cover [79,81-83],
25
26 295 and hence, also reducing the quality or quantity of feeding, nesting or hiding resources for
27
28
29 296 animal populations. Such tendencies underline the need for close monitoring of habitat
30
31 297 quality of shade coffee forests, for example, with biomarkers such as FA and feather growth
32
33 298 bars, which can detect changes of habitat quality before it is degraded to the extent that it
34
35
36
299 affects avian diversity and community demography [18,40,84,85]. Globally, about 21% of
37
38 300 bird species are currently at risk of extinction and 6.5% are functionally extinct [86],
39
40 301 underlining the urgency of monitoring efforts.
41
42
302 Future studies also may combine FA analysis in tarsus length and rectrix mass as
43
44
45 303 implemented in this study to provide a more comprehensive result. Only a few studies
46
47 304 combined FA and feather growth bar width analysis which showed the two markers showed
48
49
305 consistent result or only one of the markers show the effect of fragmentation <U+F05B>25,33,76<U+F05D>. We
50
51
52 306 recommend future studies combine the use of both biomarkers to robustly assess the habitat
53
54 307 quality following habitat conversion. FA in particular is a sensitive measure of habitat quality
55
56
308 and could be very useful in providing an early warning sign of negative effects of habitat
57
58
59 309 change before any demographic changes in affected populations can be observed [40].

6 311 Our results are consistent with results of many of the demographic studies that shade coffee
7
8 312 farming in the Ethiopian highland can be compatible with avian diversity conservation. No
9
10 313 early sign of negative effect was observed from biomarker studies. Buechley et al. [50]
11
12
13
314 showed that shade coffee farming has an important contribution for the avian biodiversity
14
15 315 conservation though forest specialist birds are disproportionally affected in shade coffee
16
17 316 farms. While the current biomarker-based study did not reveal any singe of negative effect, it
18
19
317 is important to continue monitoring the Ethiopian shade coffee for the avian biodiversity
20
21
22 318 conservation as the shade coffee plantation is still under pressure of modification and subject
23
24 319 for the increasing level of fragmentation. We also recommend combining FA and feather
25
26 320 growth bars as biomarkers to provide more comprehensive results in studies of habitat quality
27
28
29 321 for avian biodiversity conservation than using only one of them.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting study that uses fluctuating asymmetry (tarsus and tail feathers) and feather
growth rates (ptilochronology) as biomarkers to compare birds breeding in shade coffee
plantations vs native wet forests in the mountains of Ethiopia.
The topic is of general interest in that it may provide insight into whether habitat quality is
equivalent between agroforestry versus native forests; not just that the species are retained in
shade coffee plantations but that they are still able to sufficiently breed and not be sink
populations.
Our reply: Thank you very much.
While I like the idea of this study, I have a couple of comments that I think the authors would
have to address in order to convince readers of the effectiveness of their technique.
1. Validation of the Biomarkers
The first of these comments is regarding the “ground truthing” of these two biomarkers – while
there are studies to suggest that both Fluctuating Asymmetry and Ptilochronology can be
reliably associated with measures of individual condition, there are also studies that have failed
to make these connections. In the current study, there is no independent measure of condition to
which the measures of FA or Tail Growth are compared so as to show they can accurately be
used as biomarkers. This assumption, though, is the basis for the entire study (L104-107) and
recommendation for further use in other studies (L319-321). I suspect that the authors do not
have data on reproductive success or other measures of condition that they can correlate
asymmetry or tail-growth measures to, but at the very least they could compare these measure to
one another.
The use of the two biomarkers in tandem, as suggested (L84-86, L303-305), would indicate they
show the same pattern. As a result, there should be a strong negative correlation between level
of asymmetry and tail feather growth bar width (little asymmetry should correspond to large
growth bars, and high asymmetry with small growth bars). If the authors could show this
association, it would help validate these as potentially sensitive biomarkers of condition.
Our reply: Thanks for the suggestion. Yes, many studies provide a strong support of the use of
FA and Ptilochronology as sensitive biomarkers to study habitat modifications, though other
studies do not get support for the use of the biomarkers.
Our study was not designed to test the validity of the biomarkers. We make the assumption that
FA and Ptilochronology are sensitive biomarkers to effects of shade coffee management after
reading several papers on the FA and Ptilochronology (Grubb and Cimprich 1990, Leung et al.,
2001, De Coster et al., 2013, Costa et al., 2017, and many other studies cited in our paper).
Analysis of correlation between biomarkers also may not provide much information on the
validity of the biomarkers. Biomarkers sensitivity varied a lot between traits used, species under
1
study and the type of the nature of the habitat change or stress factor. The presence or absence of
correlations provides little information on the validity of the biomarkers.
In relation to our recommendation in using combined biomarkers of FA and growth bars is to
emphasise the importance of using multiple biomarkers due to the fact that biomarkers varied a
lot in their sensitivity for habitat changes. One may not see any difference in a given biomarker
and may get a significant difference on the other biomarker for a given study comparing
fragmented and continuous habitat.
In this specific study, we did “Bivariate Person correlation (r) between signed FA (in tarsus
length and rectrix mass) and average growth bar width. Singed FA both in tarsus length and
rectrix mass showed negative correlation with the average growth bar width (tarsus: r = -0.121,
N = 180, p = 0.106; rectrix: r = - 0.073, N = 222, p = 0.330)” (see, lines 202-205) revealing both
of our biomarkers reflect the same trend when we come to effects of habitat fragmentation,
increasing FA and decreasing of growth bars in fragmented habitat.
2. Ptilochronology Measure
The authors have measured growth bands on tail feathers plucked from birds at initial capture.
While they have definitely refined on Grubb’s technique (e.g. digital vs manual measurement of
individual vs groups of growth bars – L181-182 – and repeatability studies on measures that
show remarkably high confidence in measurement –L191-194), there are still problems with
measuring growth rates in feathers in this manner. First, as the authors indicate, feathers are
moulted throughout adult life, so represent a snapshot of condition/food availability in the
habitat during the time period of regrowth (L110-112). However, there is no indication in this
study if all the birds from which feathers were drawn are of the same relative age (all adults, no
juveniles) to suggest they all moulted their feathers during the same time period.
Our reply: That is right. We have now clarified that all birds we used in this study are adults as
follow “Individual adult birds were used for the further analysis of average growth bar width,
rectrix mass and mean rectrix length.” (See, lines 209 and 210).
Although the authors indicate all species are resident breeders in the region (L144), they don’t
indication whether they are year-round residents on the exact territories in which they were
captured during these studies, or whether they may have been occupying different areas during
the period of feather regrowth. Without this information, you don’t have a firm basis to conclude
that feather growth bars reflect growth in the habitats in which the birds are currently located. If
shade coffee sites are sink populations, you could be measuring birds that grew their feathers in
forested areas, then dispersed to shade coffee sites.
Our reply: Yes, we fully acknowledge the reviewer’s concern here. In our three years of study,
we ringed all captured birds and never encountered a bird which was trapped in the other nearest
fragment. On the other hand, adult and immature birds were re-trapped in the same site year after
year revealing birds of our study are in fact resident and do not cross even to the nearest possible
fragment site we studied. Our fragmented habitat and the natural forest are over 50 km apart
which makes the movement of the birds we studied unlikely.
2
The advocated technique in ptilochronology studies by Grubb is to pluck feathers from the birds
to induce regrowth, then recapture the birds and pluck the regrown feathers for measurement.
This standardizes both the temporal period in which the feathers are regrown, as well as confirms
they are regrown in the habitat the bird is currently occupying.
Our reply: Yes, as we have tried previously, our field data showed strong evidence for the study
species habitat use and resident behavior. It is unlikely that our result is affected by growth or FA
occurred other than the captured study. The sites of fragmented and natural forest are also far
apart (over 50 km).
I suspect this is not possible in the current study, but the limitation of the technique you have
used needs to be addressed and also highlighted as a possible source of not detecting differences
(e.g. L 267-268).
Our reply: We have now included detailed information on the methodological problems and
give more detail on our experience on the bird species habitat use and resident behavior.
And in the current version, we added the following sentences “Individual birds were caught first
as immatures and later as adults in the same sites year after year. Therefore, technical limitation
could not account for the absence of differences between habitat types” (see, lines: 312-314).
3. Native Forest and Shade Coffee sites being of “similar quality”
This is the conclusion that is drawn by the authors not finding differences in FA or Tail Growth
bars (L289). First, I think you need to account for the validity of your biomarkers and limitations
of your ptilochronology technique (above two points), but even then I would argue that your
results hint that this is a false conclusion to draw. While not statistically significant, the FA data
does show a pretty consistent pattern across 4 of the 5 species that there was slightly higher FA
in the shade coffee sites than natural forest sites (Figure 2a). Only one species with extremely
variable tarsal FA (Grey-backed Camaroptera) doesn’t show this pattern, and two of the other
species have suggestive P values in the 0.1 range. As you are using a proxy of condition, rather
than a direct measure of condition, I would suggest you are a little more cautious. While you
can’t statistically conclude there is a difference, it doesn’t mean the two habitats are necessarily
equivalent.
Our reply: That is correct and we slightly modify our presentation of the effects of habitat
fragmentation as follows “Although we did not find significant differences between habitats,
there is a certain tendency of increasing FA in bird species in the fragmented habitat. Hence, it is
crucial to closely monitor the avian community in the shade coffee habitat. (see, lines: 314-318).

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors did a very thorough job of addressing my previous concerns and have tightened up
the language substantially. This is a well written, succinct, and informative paper that will make
a good contribution to the agroecology literature and to avian conservation practice in
agroecosystems.
Our reply: Thanks.
I have provided a few minor edits and suggestions (one sentence in the abstract, some minor
presentation suggestions in the results, and some changes to sentence structure and rewording
for clarity in the conclusion are the most substantial of these). These should take very little time
to address, after which I recommend accept as is without the need to review the MS again. The
authors have demonstrated great care in responding to and addressing previous suggestions and
it will be great to see this published.
Our reply: Thank you! We have incorporated all the comments and editorial suggestions in the
current submitted version of the manuscript.

Abstract: Shade coffee farming has been promoted as a means of combining sustainable coffee
production and biodiversity conservation. Supporting this idea, similar levels of diversity and
abundance of birds have been found in shade coffee and natural forests. However, diversity and
4
abundance are not always good indicators of habitat quality because there may be a lag before
population effects are observed following habitat conversion. Therefore other indicators of
habitat quality should be tested. In this paper, we investigate the use of two biomarkers:
fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of tarsus length and rectrix mass, and feather growth bars (average
growth bar width) to characterise habitat quality of shade coffee and natural forests. We
predicted higher FA and narrower feather growth bars in shade coffee forest versus natural
forest, indicating higher quality in the latter. We measured and compared FA in tarsus length and
rectrix mass and average growth bar width in more than 200 individuals of five bird species. The
extent of FA in both tarsus length and rectrix mass was not different between the two forest types
in any of the five species. Similarly, we found no difference in feather growth between shade
coffee and natural forests for any species. Therefore, we conclude that shade coffee farming in
Afrotropical rain forests of Ethiopia seems to have no negative consequences on avian
populations for the species we examined.

Lines 30&31: I suggest instead of "no negative effects” something similar to what is stated on
line 288: "...our comparison of biomarkers suggests that shade coffee farms and natural forests

can say there are "non negative consequences".... but your data suggests habitat quality is
similar.

ments to the Author(s)
authors have addressed some of my initial concerns - for example they have confirmed that
vidual birds captured as juveniles were recaptured in subsequent years in the same locations,
cating that the biomarkers they measure (tarsal asymmetry reflecting nestling growth conditions, tail
mmetry reflecting stress on adults, and feather growth rates indicative of food availability) are
rately reflecting the conditions under the two habitats they are testing.
reply: Thank you!
y have not addressed my other concern - the validation of the biomarkers themselves. In their reply,
indicate they simply assume these markers are sensitive based on other studies. This is sufficient so
as they explicitly acknowledge this in the manuscript, but I also suggested a simple means of
ying this through a quick correlation between the markers to look for a negative association. The
ors appear to have attempted this (Reply letter) with a bivariate pearson correlation, with the
lts being in the correct direction but not significant. While they indicate this appears in the paper,
line numbers they refer to don't include this analysis, nor did I find it mentioned in the entire paper.
reply: Thanks, we now included the correlation analysis in our updated version both in the method
ion and briefly in the discussion. We were hesitating if we should include this to the manuscript or
ain this in the reply letter for the reviewer.
pite this, the authors have qualified a bit of their language in the revised manuscript to acknowledge
more uncertainty of their results, particularly as their results failed to show an difference in
ndicators between samples from either habitat where others have found such differences (Buechley
l. 2015, L298).
ever, without this validation, I feel that the paragraph (L315-323) recommending "future studies
bine the use of both biomarkers to robustly asses the habitat quality" is overstated. This advocation
oblematic when you yourselves have assumed these are robust measures without actually testing or
onstrating this. I suggest simply omitting this paragraph.
reply: Thanks for this comment. We recommend the use of combining biomarkers to emphasis the
d of using different traits as biomarkers varied a lot on their sensitivity for environmental changes.
uding the correlation in our new version manuscript, we hope keeping this sentence is fine.
0-294. Sentences are poorly constructed. I would suggest something like:
individual birds were initially banded as juveniles, and subsequently recaptured in later years as
lts in the same sites, this suggests our biomarker measures (tarsal and retrice asymmetry and feather
wth rates) should reflect conditions faced within our two specific regions - shade coffee vs natural
sts".
uld also suggest this would probably be better to put into the Methods than leave to the Discussion.
reply: Ok, thanks. And we did as suggested.
