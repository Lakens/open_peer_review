The paper presents an improved fractal box-counting dimension method for bearing fault
diagnosis. However, there are still somethings need to be modified to make the paper more
readable.
1. In order to verify the proposed method, the paper made comparisons with the methods from
references.[33],[34],[35]. However, the methods from these three references are kinds of fractal
box-counting and grey relation algorithm. In fact, researchers have developed so many
approaches to do the bearing fault diagnosis, thus it is suggested to make comparisons with more
common methods.
2. the descriptions and mathematical descriptions of the proposed methods are not clearly.
3. The writing is suggested to be improved by aid of some native English speakers.

Rolling bearing fault diagnosis is one challenge for rotating machinery condition monitoring and
health management. Vibration-based diagnostic methods have received much attention in the
past few decades, and many signal processing techniques have applied to bearing fault diagnosis.
This paper suggests a rolling bearing on-line fault diagnosis based on multi-dimensional
3
characteristics, and a gray relation algorithm was employed for achieving bearing fault pattern
recognition. It provides a good idea for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. There are some comments
on your paper after review.
(1) This paper emphasizes using the improved fractal dimension size in the title. However, multi-
dimensional features are entropy characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and Improved
Fractal Box-counting Dimension characteristics, and these three types’ characteristics have the
same weight in fault symptom. It could not be clearly seen from the Title, Abstract and
Introduction what are the advantages of improvement of fractal box dimension features.
(2) There is some overlap between the content in the abstract and the introduction. I suggest the
authors re-edit the abstract.
(3) Health assessment and fault diagnosis are two different concepts. In this paper, the authors
mentioned the research goal is to improve the accuracy of health status assessment, and the
content of the paper is how to improve the accuracy of rolling bear fault diagnosis. Please explain
it.
(4) On page 2, lines 8 to 18, the author provide a great description of discussing the differences
between support vector machines and neural networks. However, these techniques have nothing
to do with the content of this paper. it is recommended to delete. I suggest the authors to add
some references on bearing diagnostics based on gray relation theory.
(5) Why do authors select Entropy characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and improved
generalized box-counting dimension characteristics as multi-dimensional feature? Entropy is a
measure of information uncertainty of the signal distribution. what is the reason of selecting
Shannon entropy and exponential entropy? It can be seen from Figure 3 that the Shannon
entropy and exponential entropy cannot distinguish between the ball fault and the outer race
fault under normal operating conditions, and it may be reflect the diagnostic result in Table 2.
(6) I recommend a more detailed explanation of Figs.3-10 to analysis the relationship between
Multi-dimensional features and fault types and fault severity.

As the rolling bearing vibration signal is of nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics, the heath
status information distributed in the rolling bearing vibration signal is complex, and using
common time domain or frequency domain approaches cannot easily make an accurate
assessment for the rolling bearing health status. In the paper, a multi-dimensional feature
extraction algorithm on the basis of entropy characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and
improved generalized fractal box-counting dimension characteristics was performed for
extracting health status feature vectors from the bearing vibration signals. The experimental
study has illustrated the proposed method can effectively recognize different fault types and
severities in comparison with the existing pattern recognition methods. The overall technical
route is reasonable with good innovation. I recommend the paper be accepted with minor
revision as follows.
1) The written English should be modified carefully throughout the paper to avoid grammatical
errors in sentences.
2) The title should be rewritten concisely to point out the novelty of the paper.
3) The author should add a “NOMENCLATURE” part after the abstract.

Thank you for your useful comments and suggestions on our manuscript. We have
modified the manuscript accordingly, and the detailed corrections are listed below:

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper presents an improved fractal box-counting dimension method for bearing fault
diagnosis. However, there are still somethings need to be modified to make the paper more
readable.
1. In order to verify the proposed method, the paper made comparisons with the methods from
references.[34],[34],[36]. However, the methods from these three references are kinds of fractal
box-counting and grey relation algorithm. In fact, researchers have developed so many approaches
to do the bearing fault diagnosis, thus it is suggested to make comparisons with more common
methods.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript and added the description “Note: The approach
of [35] is based on multifractal theory for extracting feature vectors and a gray relation
algorithm for achieving pattern recognition intelligently using the extracted feature vectors.
The approach of [36] is based on improved generalized fractal box-counting dimension and
adaptive gray relation algorithm for achieving pattern recognition intelligently using the
extracted feature vectors. The approach of [34] is based on a four-dimensional feature
extraction algorithm using entropy and Holder coefficient theories for extracting feature
vectors and a gray relation algorithm for achieving pattern recognition intelligently using the
extracted feature vectors. In these previous works, such as in reference[34-36], the authors
have fully compared the recognition results with the existing feature extraction algorithm
(such as entropy theory, Holder coefficient theory, and multifractal theory) and pattern
recognition algorithm (such as the feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BP) and
the support vector machine (SVM), the adaptive gray relation algorithm (AGRA)) in the same
topic. And at this stage, we proposed the improved algorithm based on these previous works
[34-36] to improve the rolling bearing signal subtle feature extraction performance.” below

Answer: The title has been rewritten concisely to point out the novelty of the paper as below.
Thanks for your advice!
“Improving rolling bearing on-line fault diagnostic performance based on multi-dimensional
characteristics”
(2) There is some overlap between the content in the abstract and the introduction. I suggest the
authors re-edit the abstract.
Answer: We have re-edited the abstract as below. Thanks for your advice!
“As the main cause of failure and damage of rotating machinery, rolling bearing failure of
brings huge economic losses. As rolling bearing vibration signal is of nonlinear and nonstationary
characteristics, the heath status information distributed in the rolling bearing vibration signal is
complex, and using common time domain or frequency domain approaches cannot easily make an
accurate assessment for the rolling bearing health status. In the paper, a novel rolling bearing fault
diagnostic method based on multi-dimensional characteristics was developed to meet the
requirements for accurate assessment of different fault types and severities with real-time
computational performance. Firstly, a multi-dimensional feature extraction algorithm on the basis
of entropy characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and improved generalized fractal
box-counting dimension characteristics was performed for extracting health status feature vectors
from the bearing vibration signals. And secondly a gray relation algorithm was employed for
achieving bearing fault pattern recognition intelligently using the extracted multi-dimensional
feature vector. The experimental study has illustrated the proposed method can effectively
recognize different fault types and severities after integration of the improved fractal box-counting
dimension into the multi-dimensional characteristics, in comparison with the existing pattern
recognition methods.”
(3) Health assessment and fault diagnosis are two different concepts. In this paper, the authors
mentioned the research goal is to improve the accuracy of health status assessment, and the
content of the paper is how to improve the accuracy of rolling bear fault diagnosis. Please explain
it.
Answer: In this paper, our research goal is to improving rolling bearing on-line fault
diagnostic performance based on multi-dimensional characteristics, used for make an accurate
assessment for the rolling bearing health status.
(4) On page 2, lines 8 to 18, the author provide a great description of discussing the differences
between support vector machines and neural networks. However, these techniques have nothing to
do with the content of this paper. it is recommended to delete. I suggest the authors to add some
references on bearing diagnostics based on gray relation theory.
Answer: As we have mentioned in question 1 for Reviwer 1.
We have modified the manuscript and added the description “Note: The approach of [35] is
based on multifractal theory for extracting feature vectors and a gray relation algorithm for
achieving pattern recognition intelligently using the extracted feature vectors. The approach of
[36] is based on improved generalized fractal box-counting dimension and adaptive gray
relation algorithm for achieving pattern recognition intelligently using the extracted feature
vectors. The approach of [34] is based on a four-dimensional feature extraction algorithm
using entropy and Holder coefficient theories for extracting feature vectors and a gray relation
algorithm for achieving pattern recognition intelligently using the extracted feature vectors. In
these previous works, such as in reference[34-36], the authors have fully compared the
recognition results with the existing feature extraction algorithm (such as entropy theory,
Holder coefficient theory, and multifractal theory) and pattern recognition algorithm (such as
the feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BP) and the support vector machine
(SVM), the adaptive gray relation algorithm (AGRA)) in the same topic. And at this stage, we
proposed the improved algorithm based on these previous works [34-36] to improve the
rolling bearing signal subtle feature extraction performance.” below the Table 2.
So we think the description of support vector machines and neural networks is necessary. And
the proposed pattern recognition algorithm in refereces[34-36] are based on gray relation theory,
so we think it is not nessary to add more references on bearing diagnostics based on gray relation
theory.
(5) Why do authors select Entropy characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and improved
generalized box-counting dimension characteristics as multi-dimensional feature? Entropy is a
measure of information uncertainty of the signal distribution. what is the reason of selecting
Shannon entropy and exponential entropy? It can be seen from Figure 3 that the Shannon
entropy and exponential entropy cannot distinguish between the ball fault and the outer race fault
under normal operating conditions, and it may be reflect the diagnostic result in Table 2.
Answer: As we notice that the signal feature vectors extratced by entropy(Shannon entropy
and exponential entropy) and Holder coefficient theories in reference [29][30][34] achived good
performance. And the calculation process of Entropy characteristics and Holder coefficient
characteristics is simple, which means can well balance the generality versus accuracy of the
feature extraction algorithm. And in order to improve the rolling bearing fault diagnostic
performance to meet the requirements for accurate diagnosis of different fault types and severities
with real-time computational performance, we proposed a multi-dimensional feature extraction
algorithm on the basis of entropy characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and improved
generalized fractal box-counting dimension characteristics. From Table 2, we can the
improvement of diagnostic results.
(6) I recommend a more detailed explanation of Figs.3-10 to analysis the relationship between
Multi-dimensional features and fault types and fault severity.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript. Thanks for your advice!
