The manuscript by Wu et al performs a detailed and comprehensive characterization of the
evolution of the NAD oxidase family. The analysis seems highly appropriately carried out and
well argued and will be of interest to researcher interested in plant stress biology. It is also well
written. The exception being that I cannot really follow the logic or the scientific information
regarding the transgenics. I feel that this needs to be substantially developed as it is it looks like
an "add on" with little value for the rest of the manuscript having created the transgenics it seems
a shame not to expose them to a range of stresses and characterize the consequences. I would
recommend that the authors do so - even negative results would be interesting in this context as
they would imply specificity of the results that they already show.

In plants, RBOHs, aka NADPH oxidases (NOXs), catalyze the biosynthesis of ROS, which are
involved in a variety of physiological processes. In this manuscript, the authors identified 134
RBOH homologs in 13 plant genomes. Through phylogenetic analysis, these RBOH genes were
divided into 7 subgroups. The structures and motif distributions were analyzed in these RBOH
genes. Specifically, in Brassica rapa, the authors proposed that segmental duplication was the
main cause of RBOH gene family expansion in B. rapa, based on their genomic collinearity
analysis. In addition, the expression of RBOHs in B. rapa and Arabidopsis was analyzed. Lastly,
3
Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines overexpressing BrRBOH13 exhibited enhanced tolerance to
the heavy metal lead, compared with the wild-type plants.
Overall, this manuscript provides a rather complete analysis on the phylogeny of RBOHs in a few
angiosperms, a moss, and a lycophyte with detailed information of RBOHs B. rapa, and the
putative function of BrRBOH13 in controlling plant tolerance to lead was studied in transgenic
Arabidopsis overexpressing BrRBOH13.
Major comments:
Firstly, a very important part of the manuscript is the comprehensive RBOH gene identification
in 13 plant genomes and their phylogenetic relationships. Similar work has been published
recently, for example Wang, et al. ("Characterization of Rice NADPH Oxidase Genes and Their
Expression under Various Environmental Conditions." International Journal of Molecular
Sciences (2013) 14(5): 9440-9458.) and Zhang, et al. ("Genomic, molecular evolution, and
expression analysis of NOX genes in soybean (Glycine max)." Genomics (2018)). In addition to
identifying the RBOHs in the species of interest, these papers also identified the RBOH genes in
multiple plant genomes and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. These papers and this
manuscript have many species in common, and the results should be compared. Particularly, the
division of subgroups and the gene numbers are inconsistent with these previous works.
Secondly, “segmental duplication rather than tandem duplication and having played an
important role in BrRBOH gene expansion”, which is repeatedly emphasized by the author as an
important result. It can be seen from the discussion of P5-L23 to L27 and P11-L11 to L16 and the
display of figure 5 that the authors’ approach to determine segmental duplication only
considered whether the RBOH gene and the flanking genes are in synteny blocks. But because of
the widespread presence of whole genome duplication (WGD) and recombination, this method
likely finds synteny blocks generated by WGD, which are fundamentally different from the
segmental duplication emphasized by the authors, and the method used in this manuscript
cannot distinguish between the segmental duplication and WGD. From the results in Figure 5,
the authors compared RBOH in B. rapa with homologs in Arabidopsis, according to Wang, X., et
al. ("The genome of the mesopolyploid crop species Brassica rapa. "Nat Genet (2011) 43(10): 1035-
1039.), B. rapa genome has a complex history in Brassicaceae, including a unique whole genome
triplication (WGT) event. The AtRBOH07(Chr05) and BrRBOH05(Chr03) BrRBOH14 (Chr10) gene
pairs used by the authors to support segmental duplication in the Figure 5 are just on the synteny
blocks of WGT that is supported by Wang et al (2011) (Figure 3). Therefore, segmental
duplication should not be emphasized unless it is supported by more stringent evidence.
Minor comments:
P3-L44 and P10-L29: Why are there redundant sequences, is it possible that the genome has
recently doubled?
P3-L53: When examining the contraction and expansion of gene families, it is important to
provide a statistical support for the evolutionary inferences. CAFE or BadiRates can be used.
P4-L23 to L29 and Figure 2: The 134 sequences in the phylogenetic trees are all RBOH sequences
identified by the authors, without any outgroup sequences. However, the phylogenetic tree in
Fig. 4 is misleadingly shown as a rooted tree.
P6-L9: The subgroup VII mentioned here seems to be a mistake, but actually is subgroup III.
P7-L40: Most portion of a plant genome is non-coding, so the number of genes and the size of the
genome are often uncorrelated. This comparison here is not really appropriate.
4
P10-L23: The method for identification of RBOH genes is not clear. Firstly, the specific
Arabidopsis gene IDs and the Pfam IDs should be provided. The software and parameters used
for the scanning should be provided. were only the annotated protein sequences scanned? If so,
consider whether the genome annotation could be incomplete. Furthermore, in addition to the
required motifs, whether the motifs should be arranged in a certain order should also be
considered. For example, in Fig. 4, PpRBOH02 and the genes in the subgroup VII is hard to
believe that they are RBOH genes.
P10-L34: The amount of data is not large. I would recommend using RaxML to build the tree,
which could be more reliable.
Figure 1. The centromeres should be drawn.
Figure 4. The different colors represent different motifs. However, the information of the
corresponding motifs is not indicated in the figure legend or in the figure. Furthermore, a
supplemental figure can be added, in which the alignment of all proteins is provided, and boxes
with different colors can be used to indicate different motifs.
Figure 6. The color scheme of the heatmap is counterintuitive. It would be better to use warm to
cold colors to represent high and low expression levels.
Figure 7. It is unclear why Arabidopsis plants overexpressing BrRBOH13 also showed strong
GUS activity. Was the GUS gene fused with the promoter of BrRBOH13? If so, why did leaves
also show GUS activity, given that BrRBOH13 is root specific. Has the function of the homolog of
BrRBOH13 in Arabidopsis been studied?

recently, for example Wang, et al. ("Characterization of Rice NADPH Oxidase Genes and Their

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The revised manuscript has undergone a major revision and addressed most of my concerns.
Please find my comments below.
1. P 9, lines 29-39. Although the author mentioned the function of whole genome duplication
(WGD) in the expansion of RBOH gene family in the Abstract and Discussion, no analysis was
done to determine which BrRBOH genes were duplicated by WGD and which originated from
segmental duplications. As recommended in the previous review, data from Wang et al. ("The
genome of the mesopolyploid crop species Brassica rapa. "Nat Genet, 2011, 43: 1035-1039) can be
used to determine which BrRBOH genes originated from WGD, and which BrRBOHs were from
segmental duplications. Here, it is probably necessary to stress again that segmental duplication
is not the same as WGD, and some of the B. rapa genes are from WGD but not segmental
duplications, and this is why it is necessary to distinguish these two modes of duplications in this
work.
2. P6, lines 13-25. The genes in subgroup VII lack some motifs and have large variations from
genes in the other subgroups, and they were used as an outgroup in the entire phylogenetic tree.
This approach is quite debatable, because lacking motifs and accumulated mutations in the gene
sequences could be caused by pseudogenization or annotation errors. The selection of outgroup
genes should be from another gene family which is very close to RBOHs. If there are no suitable
genes as an outgroup, I would recommend using a unroot tree instead.
3. The author mentioned in the Method that BLASTP was used as the scanning tool (P32, line 39),
then the author must have blasted against the protein sequences from annotated genomes. If so,
the impact of incomplete annotations should be considered. In P29, line 56-57, “When the
identification of RBOH members was carried out, all genome sequences have been scanned
whether they have annotation or not”, indicating that the author had considered this problem,
but how this was done should be described in the Methods as well.

(WGD) in the expansion of RBOH gene family in the Abstract and Discussion, no analysis was
done to determine which BrRBOH genes were duplicated by WGD and which originated from
segmental duplications. As recommended in the previous review, data from Wang et al. ("The
genome of the mesopolyploid crop species Brassica rapa. "Nat Genet, 2011, 43: 1035-1039) can be
used to determine which BrRBOH genes originated from WGD, and which BrRBOHs were from
segmental duplications. Here, it is probably necessary to stress again that segmental duplication
is not the same as WGD, and some of the B. rapa genes are from WGD but not segmental
duplications, and this is why it is necessary to distinguish these two modes of duplications in this
work.
2. P6, lines 13-25. The genes in subgroup VII lack some motifs and have large variations from
genes in the other subgroups, and they were used as an outgroup in the entire phylogenetic tree.
This approach is quite debatable, because lacking motifs and accumulated mutations in the gene
sequences could be caused by pseudogenization or annotation errors. The selection of outgroup
genes should be from another gene family which is very close to RBOHs. If there are no suitable
genes as an outgroup, I would recommend using a unroot tree instead.
3. The author mentioned in the Method that BLASTP was used as the scanning tool (P32, line 39),
then the author must have blasted against the protein sequences from annotated genomes. If so,
the impact of incomplete annotations should be considered. In P29, line 56-57, “When the
identification of RBOH members was carried out, all genome sequences have been scanned
whether they have annotation or not”, indicating that the author had considered this problem,
but how this was done should be described in the Methods as well.

Comments to the Author(s)
The revised manuscript has greatly improved its strongest part and added additional information
concerning the transgenics that they created. While I still find this section relatively superficial
and the manuscript slightly unbalanced I appreciate the authors efforts and thus recommend that
the manuscript is published

Evolutionary and functional analysis of the plant-specific NADPH
oxidase gene family in Brassica rapa L.
Dahui Li, Di Wu, Shizhou Li, Yu Dai, and Yunpeng Cao
Dear Editor:
Thank you for your critical reading of our manuscript (RSOS-
181727). And we have revised the manuscript in accordance with the
reviewers’ comments. Enclosed is a revised version of our manuscript,
where the changes are highlighted in blue. Moreover, figure 1, figure 2,
figure 6, and figure S1 are re-prepared. Previous figures 3 and 4 are
integrated into one figure (i.e., figure 4). Figure 3, and two electronic
supplemental files (i.e., figures S2 and S5) are added into the revised
manuscript.
The questions of the reviewers and our answers are listed in the
following:
To Reviewer #1:
1. [The manuscript by Wu et al performs a detailed and
comprehensive characterization of the evolution of the NAD
oxidase family. The analysis seems highly appropriately carried out
and well argued and will be of interest to researcher interested in
plant stress biology. It is also well written. The exception being that
I cannot really follow the logic or the scientific information
regarding the transgenics. I feel that this needs to be substantially
developed as it is it looks like an "add on" with little value for the
rest of the manuscript having created the transgenics it seems a
shame not to expose them to a range of stresses and characterize the
consequences. I would recommend that the authors do so - even
negative results would be interesting in this context as they would
imply specificity of the results that they already show.].
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In this study, BrRBOH13
transgenic Arabidopsis have been treated with both abiotic stresses
of heavy metal lead and salt NaCl, respectively. In contrast to
the results from lead stress, the transgenic plants did not showed
resistance to salt stress. We have revised this content and
supplemented as an electronic file, figure S5, presenting its
phenotype under salt stress, in the revised manuscript.
(1) (Results section, page 7, line 24) These BrRBOH13 transgenic
lines treated with both abiotic stresses of heavy metal lead and salt
NaCl, respectively. As showed in figure 7D–7G, the transgenic
Arabidopsis plants overexpressing BrRBOH13 have increased
tolerance to heavy metal lead (figure 7D–7G). Upon 0.05 mM
Pb2+-treatments, the BrRBOH13 transgenic plants were able to
keep normal growth throughout the duration from 2 to 7 days
(figure 7D and 7E), whereas wild type Arabidopsis has gradually
undergone chlorosis and turned into senescent phenotype (figure 7F
and 7G). After the treatment with salt stress (200 mM NaCl) for 7
days, the transgenic plants showed the appearance of both chlorosis
and necrotic lesions on their leaves, compared to the control ones
without NaCl-treatment (electronic supplementary material, figure
S4). This result suggested that no enhanced salt tolerance was
activated in BrRBOH13 transgenic Arabidopsis plants.
(2) (Discussion section, page 10, line 27) In the present research,
the BrRBOH13 transgenic Arabidopsis plants were enhanced in
resistance to lead stress, compared to the chlorotic and wilted
phenotype in the control line (figure 7). In contrast to the results
from lead stress, the transgenic plants did not showed resistance to
salt stress (electronic supplementary material, figure S4), implying
BrRBOH13 might be involved in conferring tolerance with
specificity to certain abiotic conditions. Thus, it is likely to utilize
the gene BrRBOH13 for the potential crop improvement. And
involvement of RBOH gene family in the molecular regulation of
different abiotic stresses, provides a cue for future research.
(3) (Material and methods section, page 13, line 2) For salt stress,
the seedlings were irrigated with 200 mM NaCl for 7 days.]
To Reviewer #2:
1. [Firstly, a very important part of the manuscript is the
comprehensive RBOH gene identification in 13 plant genomes and
their phylogenetic relationships. Similar work has been published
recently, for example Wang, et al. ("Characterization of Rice
NADPH Oxidase Genes and Their Expression under Various
Environmental Conditions." International Journal of Molecular
Sciences (2013) 14(5): 9440-9458.) and Zhang, et al. ("Genomic,
molecular evolution, and expression analysis of NOX genes in
soybean (Glycine max)." Genomics (2018)). In addition to
identifying the RBOHs in the species of interest, these papers also
identified the RBOH genes in multiple plant genomes and analyzed
their phylogenetic relationships. These papers and this manuscript
have many species in common, and the results should be compared.
Particularly, the division of subgroups and the gene numbers are
inconsistent with these previous works.]
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have revised this part
of text in accordance with your comments.
(1) Two of the pubublish papers have been added into the reference
list: 17. Wang GF, Li WQ, Li WY, Wu GL, Zhou CY, Chen KM.
2013 Characterization of rice NADPH oxidase genes and their
expression under various environmental conditions. Int. J. Mol. Sci.
14, 9 440–9 458. (doi:10.3390/ijms14059440); 18. Zhang ZB,

expression analysis of NOX genes in soybean (Glycine max).
Genomics, available online. (doi:10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.03.018).
(2) (Introduction section, page 3, line 3) In plants, RBOH genes
and their functions have been extensively characterized in
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and
soybean (Glycine max) [4,11,17,18].
(3) (Discussion section, page 8, line 12) And the numbers of
RBOHs in Arabidopsis, P. trichocarpa, rice, and soybean, were
consistent with those in the previous reports [4,17,18].
Inconsistency in gene numbers was found out within four species,
i.e., Z. mays (15), S. bicolor (9), P. patens (5), and S. moellendorffii
(8) in the presented study, which were 12, 7, 4 and 5 in the previous
work, respectively [17]. After rescreening of the respective
genome data of these four species, all of RBOHs in the present
study have been validated with the presence of the conserved
RBOH domains (electronic supplementary material, figure S1 and
figure 2).
(4) (Discussion section, page 8, line 29) In addition, compared with
the previous analysis on RBOHs among soybean or rice and other
plants [17,18], some similar phylogenetic relationships were
obtained. For example, four GmRBOHs (02, 16, 17, and 12) were
not only formed into two paralogous pairs (GmRBOH02-
GmRBOH16, and GmRBOH17-GmRBOH12), but also grouped
with AtRBOH01 and three OsRBOHs (01, 09 and 08) into the
division of subgroup I, while another four GmRBOHs (03, 07, 09,
and 05), producing two paralogous pairs (GmRBOH03-
GmRBOH07, and GmRBOH09-GmRBOH05), were grouped with
four AtRBOHs (06, 09, 07, 08) into the division of subgroup II in
the present study (figure 2).
(5) In the published paper by Wang, et al. ("Characterization of
Rice NADPH Oxidase Genes and Their Expression under Various
Environmental Conditions." International Journal of Molecular
Sciences (2013) 14(5): 9440-9458.), a total of 65 RBOH proteins
were recognized in nine species, including 9 in rice, 10 in
Arabidopsis, 10 in Populus trichocarpa, 7 in Vitis vinifera, 1 in
Picea sitchensis, 12 in Zea mays, 7 in Sorghum bicolor, 4 in
Physcomitrella patens, and 5 in Selaginella moellendorffii. Seven
out of nine species are also included in the present study. And the
identifed RBOHs from these seven species consisted of 9 in rice,
10 in Arabidopsis, 10 in P. trichocarpa, 15 in Z. mays, 9 in S.
bicolor, 5 in P. patens, and 8 in S. moellendorffii. Therefore, gene
numbers that are inconsistent with the previous work are presented
in four species, i.e., Z. mays (15), S. bicolor (9), P. patens (5), and
S. moellendorffii (8). After rescreening of the respective genome
data of these four species, all of RBOHs in the present study have
been validated with the presence of the conserved RBOH domains.
The inconsistency in the division of subgroups on the phylogenetic
trees, were likely due to the difference in the selected species for
analysis, albeit 7 or 3 out of 13 species in this study were same
with the previous ones, respectively [17,18].]
2. [Secondly, “segmental duplication rather than tandem duplication
and having played an important role in BrRBOH gene expansion”,
which is repeatedly emphasized by the author as an important result.
It can be seen from the discussion of P5-L23 to L27 and P11-L11
to L16 and the display of figure 5 that the authors’ approach to
determine segmental duplication only considered whether the
RBOH gene and the flanking genes are in synteny blocks. But
because of the widespread presence of whole genome duplication
(WGD) and recombination, this method likely finds synteny blocks
generated by WGD, which are fundamentally different from the
segmental duplication emphasized by the authors, and the method
used in this manuscript cannot distinguish between the segmental
duplication and WGD. From the results in Figure 5, the authors
compared RBOH in B. rapa with homologs in Arabidopsis,
according to Wang, X., et al. ("The genome of the mesopolyploid
crop species Brassica rapa. "Nat Genet (2011) 43(10): 1035-1039.),
B. rapa genome has a complex history in Brassicaceae, including a
unique whole genome triplication (WGT) event. The
AtRBOH07(Chr05) and BrRBOH05(Chr03) BrRBOH14 (Chr10)
gene pairs used by the authors to support segmental duplication in
the Figure 5 are just on the synteny blocks of WGT that is supported
by Wang et al (2011) (Figure 3). Therefore, segmental duplication
should not be emphasized unless it is supported by more stringent
evidence.]
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have revised the
related description in accordance with your comments.
(1) A paper has been added into the reference list: 22. Wang XW,
Wang HZ, Wang J, Sun RF, et al. 2011 The genome of the
mesopolyploid crop species Brassica rapa. Nat. Genet. 43, 1 035–
1 039. (doi:10.1038/ng.919)
(2) (Abstract section, page 1, line 18) the results suggested that
whole genome duplication (WGD) might have played an important
role in BrRBOH gene expansion.
(3) (Discussion section, page 9, line 14) It has been reported that B.
rapa genome had undergone a complex history of evolution in
Brassicaceae, including a unique whole genome triplication (WGT)
event [22]. The gene pairs demonstrated in figure 5, such as
AtRBOH07 (Chr05)-BrRBOH05 (Chr03), and AtRBOH07
(Chr05)-BrRBOH14 (Chr10), are representatives on the synteny
blocks of WGT according to the evolution of B. rapa genome [22].
These results suggest that whole genome duplication (WGD) might
have played an important role in BrRBOH gene expansion.
(4) (Discussion section, page 11, line 8) it is likely that WGD and
purifying selection were involved in the evolution of the BrRBOHs
in B. rapa.]
3. [P3-L44 and P10-L29: Why are there redundant sequences, is it
possible that the genome has recently doubled?]
[Redundant sequences in the text were the sequences of different
transcripts from one gene. It is our fault that we improperly
described theses sequences. We have deleted this incorrect
description in the revised manuscript.
(1) (Results section, page 3, line 21) Four of the 138 identified
NOXs were removed from the initial collection because they are
different transcripts from one gene.
(2) (Material and methods section, page 11, line 22) to remove
sequences of different transcripts from one gene.]
4. [P3-L53: When examining the contraction and expansion of gene
families, it is important to provide a statistical support for the
evolutionary inferences. CAFE or BadiRates can be used.]
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. After the analysis of
RBOH gene family evolution using CAFE, no expansion or
decrease in RBOH gene family was found out between moss
Physcomitrella patens and the angiosperm species examined [with
Family-wide P-value: 0.270000 and Viterbi P-values
((-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-),(-,-))].
Therefore, we have revised this part of content in the revised
manuscript.
(Results section, page 3, line 26) Number of the NOX family
members was varied in the angiosperm species examined.]
5. [P4-L23 to L29 and Figure 2: The 134 sequences in the
phylogenetic trees are all RBOH sequences identified by the
authors, without any outgroup sequences. However, the
phylogenetic tree in Fig. 4 is misleadingly shown as a rooted tree.]
[Thank you for your comments. It is a careless mistake when we
prepared the previous both Fig. 4 and Fig. 2. The phylogenetic tree
presented in the previous Fig. 4 and Fig. 2 should be an unrooted
tree. We have re-prepared the figure 2 and figure 4 in the revised
manuscript. The reason for your comment ‘However, the
phylogenetic tree in Fig. 4 is misleadingly shown as a rooted tree.’,
is likely due to a greatly divergent relationship between the
subgroup VII, consisting of BrRBOH08 and 12, CsRBOH08, and
ZmRBOH08, and other subgroups. In comparison with others, the
members from the subgroup VII only have one or two RBOH-
characteristic motifs (i.e., NADPH_Ox in BrRBOH12,
CsRBOH08, and ZmRBOH08 or both NADPH_Ox and
NAD_binding_6 in BrRBOH08), respectively. As a result, it was
treated like an outgroup when the phylogenetic tree was
constructed by the NJ method.
(Result section, page 4, line 26) Based on sequence alignment, it
was found out that all of four characteristic motifs of RBOH family
(NADPH_Ox, Ferric_reduct, FAD_binding_8, and
NAD_binding_6) were presented within 124 out of 134 RBOHs
(electronic supplementary material, figure S1 and figure 2). And
there showed a high conservation of these characteristic motifs
among the RBOHs identified (figure 3). Among the remaining 10
RBOHs, BrRBOH04, BrRBOH07, and BrRBOH10 have three
(NADPH_Ox, Ferric_reduct, and NAD_binding_6 in RBOH04
and BrRBOH10, or NADPH_Ox, FAD_binding_8, and
NAD_binding_6 in BrRBOH07), BrRBOH08, PpRBOH02 and
ZmRBOH12 have two (both NADPH_Ox and NAD_binding_6 in
BrRBOH08, or NADPH_Ox and Ferric_reduct in PpRBOH02 and
ZmRBOH12), BrRBOH01 and BrRBOH12, CsRBOH08, and
ZmRBOH08 have one (NADPH_Ox) of RBOH-characteristic
motifs, respectively (figure 2). The subgroup VII, consisting of
BrRBOH08 and 12, CsRBOH08, and ZmRBOH08, showed a such
greatly divergent relationship with other subgroups that it was
treated like an outgroup when the phylogenetic tree was
constructed.]
6. [P6-L9: The subgroup VII mentioned here seems to be a mistake,
but actually is subgroup III.]
[We have revised this part of content in the revised manuscript.
(Result section, page 6, line 19,) To further investigate the
functional divergence of amino acid sequences after RBOH
duplication, a representative subgroup (III) in the phylogenetic tree
was selected because it consisted of various plant lineages.
Subgroup III was classified into three clusters.
(Electronic supplementary materials section, page 23, line 16)
Figure S4. The subgroup III selected from the phylogenetic tree in
the figure 2.]
7. [P7-L40: Most portion of a plant genome is non-coding, so the
number of genes and the size of the genome are often uncorrelated.
This comparison here is not really appropriate.]
[We have deleted this description in the revised manuscript.]
8. [P10-L23: The method for identification of RBOH genes is not
clear. Firstly, the specific Arabidopsis gene IDs and the Pfam IDs
should be provided. The software and parameters used for the
scanning should be provided. were only the annotated protein
sequences scanned? If so, consider whether the genome annotation
could be incomplete. Furthermore, in addition to the required motifs,
whether the motifs should be arranged in a certain order should also
be considered. For example, in Fig. 4, PpRBOH02 and the genes in
the subgroup VII is hard to believe that they are RBOH genes.]
[We have revised this part of content in the “Material and methods”
section. (Material and methods section, page 11, line 15) Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs) for Pfam IDs of RBOH proteins, i.e.,
NADPH_Ox (PF08414), Ferric_reduct (PF01794),
FAD_binding_8 (PF08022), and NAD_binding_6 (PF08030),
were retrieved from the Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org/),
using the Arabidopsis RBOH protein sequence (AtrbohA,
Genbank No. NP_196356.1). The HMMs were served as queries
for scanning plant genome databases by the BLASTP program (E-
value=1e-10).
As you have point out, it was found out that 10 out of 134 RBOHs,
have one to three of RBOH-characteristic motifs, respectively
(figure 2). Please refer to description in No.5 in this list. Although
PpRBOH02 and the genes in the subgroup VII have two or one of
RBOH-characteristic motifs, they were kept in the present study,
in consideration of analysis of the evolution and divergence in
RBOH family.
When the identification of RBOH members was carried out, all
genome sequences have been scanned whether they have
annotation or not. In addition, the motifs arranged in a certain order
have also be considered because the phylogenetic tree was
constructed based on a complete alignment of full length
sequences.]
9. [P10-L34: The amount of data is not large. I would recommend
using RaxML to build the tree, which could be more reliable.]
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have built the
phylogenetic using RaxML.
(Result section, page 5, line 8) Furthermore, another phylogenetic
tree was constructed using RAxML, with seven excluded from the
134 identified RBOHs, including BrRBOH01, PpRBOH02,
ZmRBOH12, and four members of the subgroup VII (electronic
supplementary material, figure S2). As showed in electronic
supplementary material, figure S2, similar division of subgroups
(I–VI) was built, compared with the previous one (figure 2).
(Material and methods section, page 11, line 25) For the
phylogenetic tree built by RAxML (Randomized Axelerated
Maximum Likelihood), the online tool (https://raxml-ng.vital-it.ch)
was applied.
(Electronic supplementary materials section, page 23, line 8,)
Figure S2. The phylogenetic tree is constructed using RAxML,
after 7 members with one or two RBOH-characteristic motifs were
excluded from the 134 identified RBOHs. Six subgroups are
indicated with I–VI, respectively. Other symbols are the same with
those in Figure 2.]
10. [Figure 1. The centromeres should be drawn.]
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have revised the
Figure 1 in the revised manuscript following your suggestion.
(Figure captions section, page 21, line 4) Figure 1. Genomic
distribution of RBOH genes on B. rapa chromosomes.
Chromosomal locations of RBOHs are illustrated based on the
physical position of each gene. The number of chromosomes is
indicated on the top of each chromosome. The centromeres are
marked by red ovals, respectively. The centromere on
chromosome06 is unavailable according to the current genome
data of B. rapa.]
11. [Figure 4. The different colors represent different motifs. However,
the information of the corresponding motifs is not indicated in the
figure legend or in the figure. Furthermore, a supplemental figure
can be added, in which the alignment of all proteins is provided,
and boxes with different colors can be used to indicate different
motifs.]
[We have revised this part of content in the revised manuscript. The
information of the corresponding motifs is added in the figure 4.
And Sequence logos of the conserved motifs of NADPH_Ox,

would be better to use warm to cold colors to represent high and

[We have revised the figure 6 following your suggestion.]
13. [Figure 7. It is unclear why Arabidopsis plants overexpressing
BrRBOH13 also showed strong GUS activity. Was the GUS gene
fused with the promoter of BrRBOH13? If so, why did leaves also
show GUS activity, given that BrRBOH13 is root specific. Has the
function of the homolog of BrRBOH13 in Arabidopsis been
studied?]
[In this study, the GUS gene was not fused with the promoter of
BrRBOH13. The plasmid pCAMBIA1304 itself has already been
integrated with both the promoter of CAM35S and reporter gene
GUS. When BrRBOH13 was cloned and constructed into the
plasmid pCAMBIA1304, BrRBOH13 and GUS gene are in a
tandem form, both of which are regulated by the CAM35S promoter.
Subsequently, the recombinant 35S::BrRBOH13 was transformed
into the wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0). The CAM35S promoter is
constitutive. Therefore, the gene under its regulation could be
constitutively expressed. Please refer to the “Material and methods”
section, page 12, line 27.]

Evolutionary and functional analysis of the plant-specific NADPH
oxidase gene family in Brassica rapa L.
Dahui Li, Di Wu, Shizhou Li, Yu Dai, and Yunpeng Cao
Dear Editor:
Thank you for your critical reading of our manuscript (RSOS-
181727.R1). And we have revised the manuscript in accordance with
the reviewers’ comments. Enclosed is a revised version of our
manuscript, where the changes are highlighted in blue. Additionally,
error correction in the centromere position within the figure 1, has been
performed in the revised manuscript.
The questions of the reviewers and our answers are listed in the
following:
To Reviewer #2:
1. [P 9, lines 29-39. Although the author mentioned the function of
whole genome duplication (WGD) in the expansion of RBOH gene
family in the Abstract and Discussion, no analysis was done to
determine which BrRBOH genes were duplicated by WGD and
which originated from segmental duplications. As recommended in
the previous review, data from Wang et al. ("The genome of the
mesopolyploid crop species Brassica rapa. "Nat Genet, 2011, 43:
1035-1039) can be used to determine which BrRBOH genes
originated from WGD, and which BrRBOHs were from segmental
duplications. Here, it is probably necessary to stress again that
segmental duplication is not the same as WGD, and some of the B.
rapa genes are from WGD but not segmental duplications, and this
is why it is necessary to distinguish these two modes of duplications
in this work.]
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have revised this part
of text in accordance with your comments.
(Discussion section, page 9, line 15) The gene pairs demonstrated
in figure 5 and table 1, including two gene-pairs within BrRBOHs
(BrRBOH04/BrRBOH10, BrRBOH05/BrRBOH14) and 15 gene-
pairs between BrRBOHs and AtRBOHs, are representatives on the
synteny blocks of WGT according to the evolution of B. rapa
genome [22]. Three of five pairs within BrRBOHs, i.e.,
BrRBOH01/BrRBOH06, BrRBOH02/BrRBOH09, and
BrRBOH13/BrRBOH14, were from segmental duplications (table
1).]
2. [P6, lines 13-25. The genes in subgroup VII lack some motifs and
have large variations from genes in the other subgroups, and they
were used as an outgroup in the entire phylogenetic tree. This
approach is quite debatable, because lacking motifs and
accumulated mutations in the gene sequences could be caused by
pseudogenization or annotation errors. The selection of outgroup
genes should be from another gene family which is very close to
RBOHs. If there are no suitable genes as an outgroup, I would
recommend using a unroot tree instead.]
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have revised the
phylogenetic tree using a unroot one (figure 2), presented
previously as electronic supplementary material, figure S2, which
are constructed with seven excluded from the 134 identified
RBOHs, including BrRBOH01, PpRBOH02, ZmRBOH12, and
four members of the subgroup VII.
(1) (Results section, page 5, line 5) Together with BrRBOH01,
PpRBOH02, and ZmRBOH12, four members of the subgroup VII
(BrRBOH08, BrRBOH12, CsRBOH08, and ZmRBOH08) were
excluded from the 134 identified RBOHs and the construction of a
unroot phylogenetic tree using RAxML (figure 2), because of their
great divergence with other RBOH members. As showed in figure
2, similar division of subgroups (I–VI) was built, compared with
the previous one (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).

Figure S2. The phylogenetic tree (circle a) is constructed using NJ
method, according to a complete protein sequence alignment of
134 RBOHs. Seven subgroups are indicated with I–VII,
respectively. Triangles in red, blue, purple, and green color indicate
domains of NADPH_Ox, Ferric_reduct, FAD_binding_8, and
NAD_binding_6, respectively. Circles b, c, d, and e are composed
of four above mentioned domains within each RBOHs,
respectively. Circles at the individual nodes represent bootstrap
support.

relationships of RBOHs. The phylogenetic tree (circle a) is
constructed, after 7 members with one or two RBOH-characteristic
motifs were excluded from the 134 identified RBOHs. Six
subgroups are indicated with I–VI, respectively. Triangles in red,
blue, purple, and green color indicate domains of NADPH_Ox,
Ferric_reduct, FAD_binding_8, and NAD_binding_6, respectively.

3. [The author mentioned in the Method that BLASTP was used as the
scanning tool (P32, line 39), then the author must have blasted
against the protein sequences from annotated genomes. If so, the
impact of incomplete annotations should be considered. In P29, line
56-57, “When the identification of RBOH members was carried out,
all genome sequences have been scanned whether they have
annotation or not”, indicating that the author had considered this
problem, but how this was done should be described in the Methods
as well.]
[Thank you for your valuable suggestion. As you mentioned in the
comments (In P29, line 56-57, “When the identification of RBOH
members was carried out, all genome sequences have been scanned
whether they have annotation or not”), we just mean that BLASTP
was performed by blasting against full set of genome sequences.
Due to blasting against the protein sequences from annotated
genomes, both the complete and incomplete annotations have been
considered. And the sequences without any annotations were
filtered out from the retrieval. We have revised this description in
the Material and methods section.
