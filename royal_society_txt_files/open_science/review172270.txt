Three regeneration methods (mechanical, thermally and wet regeneration) of foundry waste sand
were proposed in this paper. The results were shown that three regeneration methods can meet
the requirement of sand performance and similar to the raw sand, and the wet regeneration
method is the best one among the three methods.
The results of this study have some practical significance. However, the quality of this paper is
general and it needs some revisions for publication.
Comments to the Authors:
1. The format of Table 2, 3, 4 and 6 is inappropriate, for example, “Mechanical regeneration time”
should be “Mechanical regeneration time/min”,“Performance of reclaimed sand after time of
mechanical reclamation” should be “Performance of reclaimed sand after mechanical
reclamation”.
2. The expressions in Figure 1b is unclear and should be revised.
3. A proper improvement in English is needed. And the references should be revised, such as the
author list of Reference 4 should be Fan Zitian, Liu Fuchu, Long Wei, et al.

The manuscript concerns the application of three regeneration methods to animal glue waste
sand in order to improve their properties. The work is interesting and innovative, but it requires
a total revision in English language, grammar and syntax.
Some observations:
3
It is not clear how many specimens/tests were done in order to achieve the results. A stastical
analysisi is also lacking.
In my opinion the three regeneration methods should be explained more in detail, maybe with
any figure useful for understanding how do they operate.
More comments about the results would be useful: e.g. why temperature or water:sand ratio
influence the results of LOI, clay content etc.
Please pay attention to tables' format and contents.

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript
entitled “Research on Regeneration Methods of Animal Glue Waste Sand for
Foundry” (No. RSOS-172270). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for
revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our
researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made correction which we
hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The main
corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
1. The abstract part of this MS is limited and needs to be re-written.
Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing this paper, we have re-written it
according to the Reviewer’s suggestion.
The sand molds are used in casting process. However, after heating, the binder in
sand loses the binding properties, and most part of the foundry sand has to be
discarded from the process. The waste foundry sand after the regeneration can be
recycled, and reclamation can reduce the production cost and lower waste emissions.
The objective of this work was to investigate the possibility of reusing the animal glue
binder waste foundry sand from the study of three regeneration methods. Studies with
the waste foundry sand and reclaimed sand were performed in order to compare the
results obtained with the raw sand. The characterization of the samples was performed
by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS).
Results show that the waste sand was regenerated by mechanical regeneration,
thermal regeneration and wet reclamation, respectively. The reclaimed sands have a
better performance and similar to the raw sand. Further, the wet regeneration method
is the best one among the three methods.
2. The each test of the sand, standards should be declared.
Response: As Reviewer suggested that we have re-written it.We have added the
regeneration process figure (as follow Figure1).
Loss on ignition (LOI) is the measurement of the weight change of a sample,
according to the national testing standard of moulding sand performance[9]. A sample
of 10<U+F0B1>0.001 gm of reclaimed sand from each reclamation method was taken and
heated for 1hours in an oven for 1000<U+F0B0>C to test LOI. The LOI value is obtained based
on the calculation below. The final LOI value was the average of the three samples.
The clay content of sand was determined by methylene absorption method. This
test consists of titrating the molding sand (5 g mixed in 100 ml of water and 1.5 ml
of sulfuric acid.) with methylene blue, as published by national testing standard of
moulding sand performance. Moreover, the final clay content value was the average
of the three samples.
American foundryman’s society (AFS) fineness was determined by sieving with
reference to a grading test, in which the weight proportions are separated by passing
the dried sample (100 g) through a set of cast testing sieve (GB-T2684-2009).
The tensile strength of the prepared '8' samples was measured by an SWY testing
machine. Firstly, a sample was placed on the testing machine. Then, the sample was
gradually loaded until it was broken and its tensile strength value could be recorded in
the instrument. The final tensile strength was the average of the five samples.
3. More comments about the results would be useful.
Response: As Reviewer suggested that we have added it.
For example, the surface morphology of sand at SEM observation(Figure 2) , the
surface of the animal glue waste sand is coated with a large number of residual binder
attachments and surface is rough. Furthermore, the residual binder attachments are
formed the films on the surface of waste sand, so the waste sand surface energy
decreases. The thicker the inert film on the surface of the waste sand, the sand has
smaller surface and the lower the activity.
4. The conclusion of this MS is poor and needs to be re-written.
Response: We have re-written it according to the Reviewer’s suggestion.
In this study, we characterized waste foundry sand and raw sand. We also found
that the three regeneration systems affect the nature of reclaimed sand, most notably
the LOI and the clay content.
Both our obtained results demonstrate that waste sand can be regenerated by
mechanical regeneration, thermal regeneration and wet regeneration. Moreover, the
sequence of regeneration methods effecting the LOI and clay content was wet
reclamation, thermal regeneration and thermal regeneration. All reclaimed sands were
similar to the raw sand. Besides, the wet regeneration method is the best one among
the three methods, it may be more suitable for large-scale production.
5. The expressions in Figure 1b is unclear and should be revised.
Response: From the SEM of waste sand, the surface of the animal glue waste sand is
coated with a large number of residual binder attachments and surface is rough.
Furthermore, the residual binder attachments are formed the films on the surface of
waste sand, so the waste sand surface energy decreases. The thicker the inert film on
the surface of the waste sand, the sand has smaller surface and the lower the activity.
6. The format of Table 2, 3, 4 and 6 is inappropriate.
Response: As Reviewer suggested that we have revised them.
7. The writing of this MS needs to be re-written.
Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing this paper, we have re-written it
according to the Reviewer’s suggestion
We greatly appreciate both your help and that of the referees concerning improvement
to this paper. We hope that the revised manuscript is now suitable for publication.
Thank you and best regards.

Appendix B
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript
entitled “Research on Regeneration Methods of Animal Glue Waste Sand for
Foundry” (No. RSOS-172270). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for
revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our
researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made correction which we
hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The main
corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
1. The title of sections 4 and 5 is the same.
Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing this paper, we have re-written it
according to the Reviewer’s suggestion.
4 Mechanical regeneration and mechanical reclaimed sand characteristics
5 Thermal regeneration and thermal reclaimed sand characteristics
2. The statistical analysis is lacking.
Response: As Reviewer suggested that we have added it.
As presented in the table, the performance of three reclaimed sands were similar
to the raw sand. The sequence of regeneration methods effecting the LOI and clay
content was wet reclamation, thermal regeneration and thermal regeneration. The LOI
(0.35%) and clay content (0.29%) of wet reclaimed sand were the lowest. Moreover,
mechanical regeneration and thermal regeneration have a long time, high-energy
consumption and low regeneration efficiency. The wet regeneration has a short time,
high regeneration efficiency and simple equipment. The waste water can be recycled
after simple treatment. The wet regeneraation may be more suitable for large-scale
production.
3. The DOI for research data seems to be out of order.
Response: As Reviewer suggested that we have re-written it.
Our data are deposited at Dryad: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.30cm4gm
We greatly appreciate both your help and that of the referees concerning improvement
to this paper. We hope that the revised manuscript is now suitable for publication.
Thank you and best regards.
