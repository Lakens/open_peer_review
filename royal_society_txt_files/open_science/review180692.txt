Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In this paper, the author investigated a singular combination of metric and a scalar field. This is
classically singular (probably a naked singularity), but it will be interesting to see its behavior in
quantum gravity based on the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.
I would like to recommend this paper for the publication after the author answers several
questions.
First, the finiteness of the wave function would not mean so much, since it depends on the choice
of the boundary condition. Can you clarify the dependence on the boundary condition (e.g.,
choice of coefficients)?
Second, I think that the more important issue is the normalizability of the wave function. If it
does not diverge at the singularity, then it is a good signal. I think that this will be well defined,
but if it is not the case, then the finiteness of the wave function would not be so meaningful.

In the third section some part of the metric is “relaxed” to an arbitrary function. There in no clear
physical motivation for this promotion.
As far as I can see the calculations in the present work are correct.

This work has many assumptions, clearly stated by the author, but there is not
a clear motivation or justification for them.
The conclusion "that in the specific case studied here where classical spacetime has curvature
singularities the quantum mechanical wavefunction can be finite, and that furthermore this is an
indication of general behaviour” is too farfetched. This conclusion is not justified.
two misprints (?):
In Eq. (27) $\pi_\xi$ should be squared.
The right spelling of ref. [27] is Tomimatsu.
The acceptance of this work depends on a better physical justification of the many assumptions.
In particular the "relaxation" process and a modification of the claim that the absence of
singularity in the quantum solution in this work is an indication of general behaviour.

I read the article and I believe that the article merits publication as it is, after the successful
revision that the author performed. The material covered and solutions provided are useful
additions to the existing literature, plus the perspective that the author adopts is novel in my
opinion. I therefore suggest acceptance.

dependence on the boundary condition

In the present case the boundary condition is that the
wavefunction should vanish in the
asymptotically flat region, naively far away from the
origin.
This is ok in both cases but can be a bit messy to
describe.

Normalization turns out to be difficult.
For the first example if one follows the rules one ends up
with definite integrals that
are not computable by maple or me.
I found a way around this in which a 'small' change in the
wavefunction produces computable
results (this took some time).
For the second example integrals of Whittaker functions are
not computable by maple or me,
and investigation of normalization by these methods does
not start.

>In the third section some part of the metric is 'relaxed'

>There in no clear physical motivation for this promotion.
What 'relaxation' entails is that one component of the
metric is taken to be a quantum
variable rather than them all, so it is similar to the
mini-superspace method in quantum
cosmology.
The physical motivation is that the system is described by
two variables the scalar field
and the killing potential, each of these in turn is
relaxed.
In other words the two classically descriptive variables
are replaced in turn by
quantum ones.
I have added this to the introduction.
>This work has many assumptions, clearly stated by the
author, but there is not
>a clear motivation or justification for them.
I have tried to get results by the simplest means which is
a sort of justification,
for motivation see my answer to the previous point.
>The conclusion "that in the specific case studied here

>singularities the quantum mechanical wavefunction can be

This conclusion is not justified.
I have replace 'is' by 'could be'.
>two misprints (?):
>In Eq. (27) $\pi_\xi$ should be squared.
>The right spelling of ref. [27] is Tomimatsu.
I have corrected these.
>The acceptance of this work depends on a better physical
justification of the many assumptions.
>In particular the "relaxation" process and a modification
of the claim that the absence of
>singularity in the quantum solution in this work is an
indication of general behaviour.
I hope that I have covered this in ref2-point1 above.

Abstract: The d'Alembertian $\Box\phi=0$ has solution
$\phi=f(v)/r$,
where $f$ is a function of a null coordinate $v$,
and this allows creation of a divergent singularity out of
nothing.
In scalar-Einstein theory a similar situation arises both
for the scalar field
and also for curvature invariants such as the Ricci scalar.
Here what happens in canonical quantum gravity is
investigated.
Two minispace Hamiltonian systems are set up:
extrapolation and approximation of these indicates that
the quantum mechanical wavefunction can be finite at the
origin.
