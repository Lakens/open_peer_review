In the paper, a dual improved fractal box-counting dimension eigenvectors algorithm was
proposed to extract subtle features of radiation source signals. The effectiveness of the proposed
method has been validated by the testing signals from experimental data set from Case Western
Reserve University Bearing Data Center. Compared with the traditional fractal box-counting
dimension algorithm and the single improved fractal box-counting dimension algorithm, the
proposed dual improved fractal box-counting dimension eigenvectors algorithm, can better
extract the signal subtle distribution characteristics, and has a better recognition effect with good
real-time performance.
The overall technical route is reasonable with some innovation. I recommend the paper be
accepted with minor revision as follows.
1) The written English should be modified carefully throughout the paper to avoid grammatical
errors in some sentences.
2) The autors should declare whether there are background noise in the testing signals from
experimental data set.
3) The author should pay careful attention to the format problems in the paper and check the font
size throughout the paper.
4) The recognition results by the proposed method show that the total recognition success rate
can reach 98.86%. If the authors have some suggestions about improving total recognition success
rate in the future work?

In this paper the authors present its own algorithm for features’ extraction of the radiation source
signal based on the dual improved fractal box dimension. The results are considered that better
reflect the signal distribution characteristics than the previous works (traditional fractal box-
dimension and single improved fractal box-dimension.
Some clarifications are required about the results and performance claimed.
1. The value of z(t) from (6) is always 1 – p4, r4 ???
2. The presentation of the results does not allow appreciation of the claimed performance.
2.1. On page 11, the 27th row states that in the case of “traditional boxcounting dimension
method are limited, and the distances between different types of radiation source signals are
close which are not easily to be classified by a pattern recognition technique”. But it is a well
known deficiency of fractal dimension for classification of signals and images. What are the
results in case of the fractal dimension of Hilbert Transform and in case of the proposed method?
Similar tables with Table 3 are necessary (or Table 3 should be extended for comparison between
these cases). Only simple affirmations are not credible.
2.2. The authors must to present in a separate table a few results on different samples for the
same values (7, 14, 21, 28 mils) for the proposed method.
2.3. For table 4 were the same samples used to evaluate the claimed performance or just the same
number (40)? Only the number is not representative enough.

This paper presents an improvement of the classic box-counting algorithm to compute the fractal
dimension applied on subtle feature extraction of radiation signals. The paper has several
important drawbacks that have motivated my decision:
1) Reading the paper is very difficult because of the use of the English language. There are lots of
grammatical errors making very hard to read and understand the paper. It seems like a direct
translation from the native language of the authors. Authors should not have submitted their

paper without a previous revision by a native English speaker.
2) Almost all references are from Chinese authors. This fact is some strange. Is this topic of
interest only in China? Clearly not, so the authors must revise the literature and confirm this
point.
3) The title of the paper should be more descriptive, providing the main contribution of the study.
The word “research” in the title looks strange.
4) Abstract: “;” must be “.”
5) Section 1: What do SNR, HOS, WPT mean? A part of the abstract appears at the end of this
section word by word.
6) Section 2.2.: First paragraph: provide references for “electronic fault diagnosis” and
“biomedicine” topics.

must provide another figure describing the whole processing of the improved algorithm. Also,
the authors must provide another figure with the same data as the first example (traditional box-
counting) but working properly with the improved algorithm.
8) Section 2.4.: The concept of “Gray relation theory” appears here for the first time. The authors
should introduce this concept in the introduction section.
9) Section 2.5.: What does GRA means? (Figure 1 and step 3)
10) Section 3.: The authors compare their algorithm with references [28] and [29], so those
algorithms must be previously described and discussed in the paper. Why have you used only
one dataset to test your algorithm? Why have you used just that dataset to test your algorithm?
Authors should describe results from previous studies in the same topic.
11) Data availability: a more recent access of the data must be provided
12) Authors’ contribution: What are “molecular lab work” and “sequence alignments” in the
context of this paper?

Dear editor,
Thank you for your useful comments and suggestions on our manuscript. We have
modified the manuscript accordingly, and the detailed corrections are listed below:
Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
In the paper, a dual improved fractal box-counting dimension eigenvectors algorithm was proposed
to extract subtle features of radiation source signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method has
been validated by the testing signals from experimental data set from Case Western Reserve
University Bearing Data Center. Compared with the traditional fractal box-counting dimension
algorithm and the single improved fractal box-counting dimension algorithm, the proposed dual
improved fractal box-counting dimension eigenvectors algorithm, can better extract the signal subtle
distribution characteristics, and has a better recognition effect with good real-time performance.
The overall technical route is reasonable with some innovation. I recommend the paper be accepted
with minor revision as follows.
1) The written English should be modified carefully throughout the paper to avoid grammatical
errors in some sentences.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript. Thanks for your advice!
2) The autors should declare whether there are background noise in the testing signals from
experimental data set.
Answer: In the paper, the radiation source signals for testing are from Case Western Reserve
University Bearing Data Center. From fig.2 and fig.4, We can see that there are background noise
in the testing signals from experimental data set, which conform to practical application
circumstance.
3) The author should pay careful attention to the format problems in the paper and check the font
size throughout the paper.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript. Thanks for your advice!
4) The recognition results by the proposed method show that the total recognition success rate
can reach 98.86%. If the authors have some suggestions about improving total recognition success
rate in the future work?
Answer: In the future research, so as to continually improve the fault diagnostic accuracy, the
improvement of feature extraction algorithm can be further carried out and the Dempster-shafer
Evidence theory can be used to fuse the signal subtle features extacted, on the prerequisite of
algorithm real-time performance.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In this paper the authors present its own algorithm for features’ extraction of the radiation source
signal based on the dual improved fractal box dimension. The results are considered that better
reflect the signal distribution characteristics than the previous works (traditional fractal box-
dimension and single improved fractal box-dimension.
Some clarifications are required about the results and performance claimed.
1. The value of z(t) from (7) is always 1 – p4, r4 ???
Answer: the Equation (7) should be z <U+F028> t <U+F029> <U+F03D> f 2 (t ) <U+F02B> h2 (t ) . Thanks for your advice!
2. The presentation of the results does not allow appreciation of the claimed performance.
Answer: From Table 5 and Table 6, the recognition results of the proposed method illustrate that
the total recognition success rate can reach 98.86%, which shows a certain improvement in the
recognition accuracy after the application of dual improved fractal box-counting dimension
eigenvectors in the signal subtle feature extraction, compared with the methods from references [28]
and [29]. The time cost of the methods over a laptop computer with a 4.0 GHz dual processor for
one Test Case is only 0.027 seconds and the time consumption of the proposed approach is
encouraging.
2.1. On page 11, the 27th row states that in the case of “traditional boxcounting dimension method
are limited, and the distances between different types of radiation source signals are close which are
not easily to be classified by a pattern recognition technique”. But it is a well known deficiency of
fractal dimension for classification of signals and images. What are the results in case of the fractal
dimension of Hilbert Transform and in case of the proposed method? Similar tables with Table 3
are necessary (or Table 3 should be extended for comparison between these cases). Only simple
affirmations are not credible.
Answer:Table 2, Table 3, fig.3 and fig.5 has been extended for comparison between these cases.

2.2. The authors must to present in a separate table a few results on different samples for the same
values (7, 14, 21, 28 mils) for the proposed method.
Answer: The fault types contain outer race fault, the inner race fault, and the ball fault, and the fault
diameters, i.e., fault severities, contain 28 mils, 21 mils, 14 mils and 7 mils. Totally 11 types of
radiation source signals of bearing vibration data considering different fault categories and fault
severities are analyzed, as seen in Table 1. Each data sample is made up of 2048 time series points.
For those 550 data samples, each of those 550 data sample are different with different random
mechanical noise. Among them, 110 data samples are chosen randomly for the establishment of the
knowledge base, with the rest 440 data samples taken as testing data samples.

21 10 40 11
2.3. For table 4 were the same samples used to evaluate the claimed performance or just the same
number (40)? Only the number is not representative enough.
Answer: as we have illustrated above that “For those 550 data samples, 110 data samples are chosen
randomly for the establishment of the knowledge base, with the rest 440 data samples taken as
testing data samples.” We used the rest 440 data samples as testing data samples to elvaluate the
performance and each of those 550 data sample are different with different random mechanical noise.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper presents an improvement of the classic box-counting algorithm to compute the fractal
dimension applied on subtle feature extraction of radiation signals. The paper has several important
drawbacks that have motivated my decision:
1) Reading the paper is very difficult because of the use of the English language. There are lots of
grammatical errors making very hard to read and understand the paper. It seems like a direct
translation from the native language of the authors. Authors should not have submitted their paper
without a previous revision by a native English speaker.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript. Thanks for your advice!
2) Almost all references are from Chinese authors. This fact is some strange. Is this topic of interest
only in China? Clearly not, so the authors must revise the literature and confirm this point.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript. Thanks for your advice!
3) The title of the paper should be more descriptive, providing the main contribution of the study.
The word “research” in the title looks strange.
Answer:The title has been modified as “Improving the Signal Subtle Feature Extraction
Performance Based on Dual Improved Fractal Box Dimension Eigenvectors”.
4) Abstract: “;” must be “.”
Answer: We have modified the manuscript. Thanks for your advice!
5) Section 1: What do SNR, HOS, WPT mean? A part of the abstract appears at the end of this
section word by word.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript with adding a “NOMENCLATURE” part after the
abstract.
6) Section 2.2.: First paragraph: provide references for “electronic fault diagnosis” and
“biomedicine” topics.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript. Thanks for your advice!
7) Section 2.3.: Provide a figure where readers can see an example of the problem described in the
first paragraph for the traditional box-counting algorithm. At the end of this section, authors must
provide another figure describing the whole processing of the improved algorithm. Also, the authors
must provide another figure with the same data as the first example (traditional box-counting) but
working properly with the improved algorithm.
Answer:We have provided Table 2 and Table 3 to show the problem of the traditional box-counting
algorithm, and fig.3 and fig.5 to describe the processing of the Improved generalized fractal box-
counting dimension algorithm.

From Table 2 and Table 3, it is can be seen that the features extracted by traditional box-
counting dimension method with and without Hilbert Transform are both limited, and the distances
between different types of radiation source signals are close which are not easily to be classified by
a pattern recognition technique.

8) Section 2.4.: The concept of “Gray relation theory” appears here for the first time. The authors
should introduce this concept in the introduction section.
Answer:We have introduce concept of “Gray relation theory”in the introduction section.
9) Section 2.5.: What does GRA means? (Figure 1 and step 3)
Answer: We have modified the manuscript with adding a “NOMENCLATURE” part after the
abstract.
10) Section 3.: The authors compare their algorithm with references [23] and [26], so those
algorithms must be previously described and discussed in the paper. Why have you used only one
dataset to test your algorithm? Why have you used just that dataset to test your algorithm? Authors
should describe results from previous studies in the same topic.
Answer: we have add the description “Note: The approach of [23] is based on multifractal theory
for extracting feature vectors and a gray relation algorithm for achieving pattern recognition
intelligently using the extracted feature vectors. The approach of [26] is based on a four-dimensional
feature extraction algorithm using entropy and Holder coefficient theories for extracting feature
vectors and a gray relation algorithm for achieving pattern recognition intelligently using the
extracted feature vectors.” Below the Table 6.
The dataset for testing are from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center has
been a standard database for testing the effectiveness of feature extraction algorithm and pattern
recognition algorithm. Besides, the signal of the dataset is full of random mechanical noise, which
is more realistic in the practical application. The fault types contain outer race fault, the inner race
fault, and the ball fault, and the fault diameters, i.e., fault severities, contain 28 mils, 21 mils, 14
mils and 7 mils. Totally 11 types of radiation source signals of bearing vibration data considering
different fault categories and fault severities are analyzed, as seen in Table 1. Each data sample is
made up of 2048 time series points. For those 550 data samples, each of those 550 data sample are
different with different random mechanical noise. Among them, 110 data samples are chosen
randomly for the establishment of the knowledge base, with the rest 440 data samples taken as
testing data samples.

In our previous works, such as in reference[23][26], we have fully compared the results with the
existing feature extraction algorithm(such as entropy theory, Holder coefficient theory, and
multifractal theory) and pattern recognition algorithm(such as feed-forward back-propagation
neural network(BP) and support vector machine(SVM), Adaptive Gray relation algorithm(AGRA))
in the same topic. And at this stage, we proposed the improved algorithm based on our previous
works[23][26] to Improve the Signal Subtle Feature Extraction Performance Based on Dual
Improved Fractal Box Dimension Eigenvectors.

Comments to the Author(s)
1. the proposed dual improved fractal box-counting dimension algorithm, can better reflect the
signal subtle distribution characteristics under the different reconstruction phase space, and has a
better recognition effect with good real-time performance. The test data ensure the better recognition
rate, but what about the good real-time performance? You should give more analysis about this part.
Answer:
The time cost of the methods over a laptop computer with a 4.0 GHz dual processor for one
Test Case is only 0.027 seconds and the time consumption of the proposed approach is encouraging,
which shows the good real-time performance.
2. What’s the condition if the proposed method used in practice?Besides the motor drive end rotor
signals discussed in this article, What other types of radiation source signal types could use this
algorithm?
Answer: The dataset for testing are from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center has
been a standard database for testing the effectiveness of feature extraction algorithm and pattern
recognition algorithm. Besides, the signal of the dataset is full of random mechanical noise, which
is more realistic in the practical application.
In the future work, other types of radiation source signals can be further used for testing the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. The proposed algorithm used the Hilbert transform and gray relation theory, why combining
the Hilbert transform and gray relation method together can improve the recognition rate? Pls give
more theoretical analysis in this part.
Answer: In the paper, we focus the improvement of Signal Subtle Feature Extraction Performance,
and the gray relation algorithm was used as patter recognition algorim. The detailed description of
the gray relation algorithm can be seen in section 2.4. The research of gray relation theory is the
foundation of gray system theory, mainly based on the basic theory of space mathematics, to
calculate relation coefficient and relation degree between reference characteristic vector and each
comparative characteristic vector. Gray relation theory has a good potential to be used in radiation
source signal recognition with four reasons [24]: it has good tolerance to measurement noise; its
algorithm is simple and can solve the issue of generality versus accuracy; it can solve the learning
problem with a small number of samples; it has the ability to assist the selection of characteristic
parameters for classification.
And the the Hilbert transform is used for preprocessing the radiation source signal to obtain
the instantaneous amplitude of the signal, to improve Signal Subtle Feature Extraction Performance.
And the detailed description of the Hilbert transform can be seen in section 2.1.
4. The English expression should be modified carefully.
Answer: We have modified the manuscript. Thanks for your advice!
