Manuscript entitled “Investigation on the Compositions of Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine
Treatment with different Oxidants Using SPME-GC/MS” determines the intermediates and
oxidation products of Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) reacted with different
oxidants (O3, Mn2+/O3, Fe2+/H2O2) and optimizes parameters involved coating fiber, salt
addition, pH, sampling time and desorption time. The UDMH reacted with O3 leads to high
yields of N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). Metal catalytic ozonation can largely minimize the
formation of NDMA. After treatment with Fe2+/H2O2, the final products of UDMH have no
NDMA. The NDMA formation and degradation mechanism were discussed based on the
intermediates. This study is expected to provide useful information for controlling NDMA
formation during UDMH wastewater treatment.
Overall, the investigation is original. The paper is not well-written and has many grammar and
formatting problems. As a result, I think the current manuscript is not suitable for the Journal of
Royal Society Open Science, there are some comments should be considered:
Specific comments:
1. The highlight of this paper is the use of SPME-GC/MS, but the description of it in the
introduction is too simple. Could the authors supplement some advantages of using SPME-
GC/MS in the introduction part?
2. Page 3, table 1 gives some abbreviation of UDMH degradation products. Could the authors
supplement the structural formula of products in table 1?
3. Page 4, line 28, the reaction chamber was flushed with ozone (3 g/h). How to determine the
concentration (3 g/h) of ozone dissolved in water during ozonation?
4. Page 6, line 13, the author directly proposed the best choice was 65 µm PDMS / DVB instead
of 85 µm CAR/PDMS, 85 µm PA, and 100 µm PDMS. Could the authors provide some data
which can explain that 65 µm PDMS/DVB is the best choice?
5. Page 6, line 48, the authors mentioned: “Addition of salt was used to compensate on sample
recovery”. Please give more explanation of why adding salt can increase recovery.
6. Page 12, in the Fig.5, the peaks of DMA and FDMH are not separated, is this related to the
temperature rise procedure of GC/MS?
7. Page 12, line 60, was the radiolysis experiments done by yourself or by reference? Please
indicate if it comes from reference.
8. Page 13, line 6, the authors mentioned “These experiments results confirm that NDMA
formation is due to reactions associated with molecular ozone. Our results are inconsistent with
these results.” I think this statement is confused.
Small comments:
1. There should be a space between the number and the unit.
2. Introduction and conclusion parts of the text should be aligned at both ends.
3. The author should carefully check the content and formatting problems.
4. Page 1, line 19,“N-nitrosodimethylamine” should be “N-Nitrosodimethylamine”.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear reviewer,
I am appreciate for your comments and suggestions. The manuscript has been revised
based on your comments. The responses of your questions were as follows:
1. The highlight of this paper is the use of SPME-GC/MS, but the description of it in
the introduction is too simple. Could the authors supplement some advantages of
using SPME-GC/MS in the introduction part?
R: The advantages have been given in the introduction, which are marked green in page
3 line 4,5.
2. Page 3, table 1 gives some abbreviation of UDMH degradation products. Could the
authors supplement the structural formula of products in table 1?
R: The structural formula of products in table1 have been added as shown in Fig.1.
3. Page 4, line 28, the reaction chamber was flushed with ozone (3 g/h). How to
determine the concentration (3 g/h) of ozone dissolved in water during ozonation?
R:The concentration (3 g/h) is the ozone production of the ozonizer.
4. Page 6, line 13, the author directly proposed the best choice was 65 µm PDMS /
DVB instead of 85 µm CAR/PDMS, 85 µm PA, and 100 µm PDMS. Could the
authors provide some data which can explain that 65 µm PDMS/DVB is the best
choice?
R: The detail data is shown in Fig 2, which is newly added.
5. Page 6, line 48, the authors mentioned: “Addition of salt was used to compensate
on sample recovery”. Please give more explanation of why adding salt can increase
recovery.
R: The explanation has been given, which is marked green in page 8 line 6,7.
6. Page 12, in the Fig.5, the peaks of DMA and FDMH are not separated, is this related
to the temperature rise procedure of GC/MS?
R: I have tried to separate the peaks of DMA and FDMH by rising the temperature of
GC/MS. The result was not ideal. I think the reason may be that , the boiling point of
DMA is so low, resulting in wider peak and difficult to separate. It may need to be
further studied.
7. Page 12, line 60, was the radiolysis experiments done by yourself or by reference?
Please indicate if it comes from reference.
R: The radiolysis experiments comes from reference. The reference was added in page
14 line3.
8. Page 13, line 6, the authors mentioned “These experiments results confirm that
NDMA formation is due to reactions associated with molecular ozone. Our results
are inconsistent with these results.” I think this statement is confused.
R: The correct expression is “consistent with”, which has been corrected and marked
in green in page 14 line 7.
Small comments:
1. There should be a space between the number and the unit.
2. Introduction and conclusion parts of the text should be aligned at both ends.
3. The author should carefully check the content and formatting problems.
4. Page 1, line 19,“N-nitrosodimethylamine” should be “N-Nitrosodimethylamine”.
R: All of them have been corrected.
Appendix B
Dear reviewer,
I am appreciate for your comments and suggestions. The manuscript has been revised
based on your comments. The responses of your questions were as follows:
1. Throughout the whole manuscript one space should be given between number and

mg/L [1].
There should one space before the brackets.
R: The brackets have been added, which are marked red.
2. Line 28-32, Formic acid(HCOOH), Methanol(CH3OH), Acetic
acid(CH3COOH), Nitromethane (NM), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,1,5-
trimethylformazane (TMFN), Acetaldehyde dimethylhydrazone (ADMH),
Formaldehyde (HCHO).
The compound names should be in lower case letters.
R: They are all corrected in lower case letters, which are marked red.
3. Page 4, line 52, Modern samples were samples were… Authors should define what
they mean by Modern sample? Is it fresh sample, if so use fresh sample…
R: Yes, It is fresh sample. It has been corrected.
4. Page 5, line 30, before “Results and Discussion” a new sub-section “Statistical
analysis” should be include to describe the statistical treatment of data.
R: The part has been added, which is marked red in page 6.
5. Page 6, line 7, The modern sample contains….???
R: I have rewrite this sentence, which marked red in page 7 line 3,4.
6. Page 6, line 44, There were reports…give [Ref. -- ??]
R: The references have been given. (Which is marked red in page 8 line 3).
7. Page 7, Fig. 1, x-axis label should be corrected as Salt concentration (w/v, %)
R: It has been corrected.
8. Page 10, line 46, 9.340mg/L, 3.292mg/L, 5.010mg/L and 7.084mg/L…MDL data
should be given in two siginificant figures only, e.g. 9.3 mg/L, 3.3 mg/L, 5.0 mg/L
and 7.1 mg/L…
R: They are all corrected, which are marked red in page 12.
9. Page 11, Table 3, column 5, MDL should be given in two significant figures only.
The data in column 2-4 should be given in three significant figures only.
R :They are all corrected, which are marked red in Table 3.
10. Page 17, line 27, before Conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of the
proposed method should be given in comparison to the literature reported methods.
R: The advantages and disadvantages have been discussed in page 18, which are newly
added marked red.
