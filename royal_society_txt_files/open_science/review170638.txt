Comments
“Do not pick my butt: Kelp and dolphin gulls cause perineal wounds in South American fur seal
pups (Arctocephalus australis)” explores an interesting ecological interaction, that of gulls
inducing perineal wounds on fur seal pups. The authors should be commended for the scope of
the work involved in this project, and the behaviours observed in this study are interesting both
from a practical and theoretical perspective. Unfortunately, the authors have not provided
enough information in their methods or results to enable me to properly assess the validity of
their statistical analyses, nor their interpretation of them. Further, the authors used “step-wise
regression,” a method of model selection that has long since been shown to be flawed. As such,
reanalysis is required, and such a large reanalysis could drastically change the findings of this
study. As such, I cannot at this time recommends this article for publication, and in my opinion, it
requires a major revision.
Specific Comments
1. I found the “don’t pick my butt” part of the title too informal. Such a title is great for a
poster or conference presentation, but I would remove it from the peer-reviewed article.
2. Manuscript has numerous typographical and grammatical errors that need to be
addressed.
3. I have strong reservations regarding the author’s use of the Chi Square, and the Mann-
Whitney Tests. These analyses are neither the most robust nor appropriate methods available. A
more refined analysis that better takes into account the spatiotemporal scale of the data could be
done using either an ANOVA or a GLM. Due to what I assume are unequal sample sizes between
seasons, a regression is likely the best choice; however, as there is only a single factor, an ANOVA
(even one using Type I Sums of Squares) would also be appropriate. Usage of more appropriate
statistical tests may result in radically different results.
I suggest the authors refer to:
Burnham, K.P., & Anderson, D.R., (2002). Model selection and multimodel inference: a practical
information-theoretic approach: New York, NY: Springer Verlag, 514 p.
Underwood, A.J., (1997). Experiments in ecology: Their logical design and interpretation using
analysis of variance: New York, NY, Cambridge University Press, 504 p.
4. The author’s use of Stepwise Regression is extremely problematic. This method has long
since been discredited. It is also a poor method to explore relationships between variables. I
suggest the authors refer to the following work:

prevalence, and an alternative. Journal of Wildlife Management, 64(4), 912-923.

The flaws of stepwise regression have been long since elucidated, and the use of this method here
by the authors means their analysis is flawed. Usage of the Information Theoretic Model Selection
approach is more appropriate. I suggest the authors refer to:

prevalence, and an alternative. Journal of Wildlife Management, 64(4), 912-923.

inference in behavioral ecology: Some background, observations, and comparisons. Behavioral
Ecology and Sociobiology, 65(1), 23-35.
5. I suggest the authors use AICc instead of AIC. AICc is corrected for small sample sizes,
and what constitutes a small sample size will vary based upon the data collected. However, AICc
converges with AIC at sufficiently high sample sizes. Therefore, there is no downside to using
AICc. I suggest the authors refer to:

theory and its analytical extensions. Psychometrika, 52(3), 345-370.

6. Why did the authors only use AIC to select a best model? They should have used
multiple methods of model assessment such as R2, AICc w, and some measure of model
predictability, such as the mean absolute error. I suggest the authors refer to:

7. The authors have not provided enough information to assess the appropriateness of any
of their analyses. What are the sample sizes of each season? Are factors fixed? Random? Are
variables continuous? Discrete? If discrete were they coded using deviation coding in the
regression? What <U+2206>AIC was used to differentiate between models (2 is standard but 7 is
increasingly being argued for)? What was done when models preformed equally well? In all
cases not enough information has been provided to properly evaluate these analyses, nor to
confirm the author’s interpretation of them.
8. Specific to the regression the authors need to provide more information. A table must be
provided showing the differences in model performance. This table needs to include the number
of variables, the AIC (or AICC), R2, etc. This information is not provided anywhere in the
manuscript, thus the authors offer no evidence that the model they have selected is indeed the
best. The authors also need to provide a second table providing more information regarding the
model they select as the best. This table should include the coefficients of each variable, the p
value, the 95% CI, etc. Again, as this information is missing, we have no way of evaluating the
performance of this model.
9. For the analyses with small sample sizes, ensure the language in the Discussion reflects
the low power and ability to extrapolate

This manuscript titled "Do not pick my butt: Kelp and dolphin gulls cause perineal wounds in
South American fur seal pups (Arctocephalus australis)." is a good study presenting a previously
undocumented relationship between fur seal pups and gulls. I am happy with the overall design
of this study and the Introduction, Results and Discussion sections are clear and thorough.
Besides the one "major" comment I have regarding the different role of the two gull species and
its possible impact, I have only few minor comments which I have given below. If these
comments are answered adequately, I can gladly support the publications of this paper.
5
Major comment:
You have observed differences between the two gull species in the way they interact with the
pups (e.g. dolphin gulls are more aggressive). Is it possible that due to these differences either
gull species has a more severe impact on the pups? Given the low number of observed
interactions this may be hard to asses, but I would appreciate some level of speculation into this.
It does seem rather important given the context of this manuscript.
Minor comments:
Page 2, line 32: Here it says "(11/46)" when in fact the real total number of infected individuals
given in the Results section and in Table 1 was 49. Also, it should be made more clear what the
number 49 actually means. At the moment it can be mistaken for the total number of inspected
individuals.
Page 2, line 36: Instead of "however", perhaps "and" would be more suitable?
Page 5, line 17: Did defecation occur every time a pup was handled? If not, how was this taken
into
account when assessing the presence of blood in feces?
Page 11, line 34: Replace the word "shit" with feces.
page 13, line 43: instead of "learn" use "learned".
Table 1:
Perhaps you could add a summary to the bottom to sum up the number and give an overall
average for prevalence? E.g. 49 infected, 668 total, 7% average prevalence(49/668).
Would it be possible to add intensities into this table or at least tell in the Results section what
was the maximum number of ulcers oberved?
Supplementary files:
In the "perineal_wounds_safs" file, there are only 93 rows of data. What are these particular
individuals and where is the rest of the data? You did examine 668 individuals and I would like
to see a data file including all these individuals.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr. Seguel,
I have now received comments from two expert reviewers regarding your manuscript. As you
will see their opinions were rather divergent, but both agreed that your manuscript provides a
useful contribution to the literature. Reviewer 1, however, made a very compelling case
regarding your statistics and the conclusions that can be drawn from them. Given that the results
can (and very well may) change after re-analysis my decision is to reject your paper but allow for
resubmission after addressing these extremely important issues. Moreover, I want to personally
echo the point made by Reviewer 1 that the title is inappropriate for this (or any other) journal,
and that you should remove the lead in "Do not pick my butt" from the title.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I was one of the original reviewers and the authors have done a very good job in incorporating
my previous comments. I also echo my earlier comments that the authors should be commended
for undertaking this project, and it will contribute both theoretically and practically to our
understanding of such ecological interactions. The authors have also have done a good job in
reanalyzing their data, and their use of model averaging is very well done. I only have a few
minor comments and suggestions for revisions.
The authors are correct that the Chi squared test is commonly used, however, this does not mean
that it is the most appropriate statistical test to be used. The authors have changed some of their
analyses from Chi squared tests to other, in my opinion, more appropriate analyses, and have left
others. The authors have a very powerful dataset, and more robust analytical methods allow the
authors to more effectively identify trends in their data. That being said, their continued use of
Chi squared tests while not the most effective method of analysis, is appropriate and therefore its
use does not preclude this manuscript from publication.
The manuscript still has several grammatical errors. I suggest the authors have a colleague read it
closely.
I fundamentally disagree with the authors when they write: “…. would like to ask the editor to
please confirm that those files are correctly attached to the manuscript since they can be critical
for the proper evaluation of the statistical methods used.” In response to my request to provide
more information, the authors have provided two supplemental tables. In my view this is not the
proper use of supplemental material. The information provided in these tables are fundamental
to understanding the analyses conducted by the authors. This information must be easily
accessible in the main paper if the analyses are to be properly understood. These tables should be
moved from supplemental material to the paper itself.
11
The authors do a good job explaining in their response to the revisions as to how they calculated
power. However, they still only mention this in the discussion, and do not describe how it was
calculated. How this power was calculated needs to be detailed in the methods.
AICc the second C needs to be in subscript throughout the manuscript
I am very confused by what the authors mean when they write “A delta AICc of two was
considered significant but we provide and discuss results from all the models that performed
within a range of delta AICc of 7.” Does this mean that the candidate suite of top-ranked models
were those within 7AICC units of the top-ranked model? This needs to be clarified. Further, this

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Dear Dr. Seguel,
I have now received comments from a previous reviewer on you resubmitted manuscript. The
reviewer continues to have a few issues with this paper but was largely satisfied with your
responses and changes. I have given your paper a close read and agree with a couple of the
salient points the reviewer made, notably that the information in your tables regarding your
statistical methods should be moved to the body of the paper rather than in supplementary
material, and that the grammar continues to need some attention. To this end you should move
the statistical methods from the supplementary materials to the main paper, add information
about how you calculated power into the methods, address the minor edits the reviewer pointed
out and address the grammatical issues throughout the manuscript. Throughout the manuscript
you should be consistent with whether Dolphin gull and Kelp gull are capitalized or not.
Regarding your grammar, I have provided several minor editorial comments that you should
incorporate into a revised draft. Assuming these changes are made, I believe you have addressed
the important issues and have provided a very nice study of merit.

P9: Several edits - “This behavior usually occurred right after pup defecation, when Kelp and
Dolphin gulls engaged in consumption of pup’s feces and picked the perineal areas spotted with
fecal material. Kelp gulls usually interacted first with fur seal pups. After Kelp gulls had
consumed some feces or picked the perineal area 3 to 5 times, they retired, leaving pups
vulnerable to interactions with Dolphin gulls that would actively consume the remaining feces
and aggressively pick the perineal area (Figures 3a and 3b). The response of pups was usually
limited to move away from the area or try to bite seagulls, however they never succeeded in their
attempts in any recorded interaction. On rare occasions (n=6), Dolphin gulls approached sleeping
pups and picked the perineal region in a similar manner to how they approach dead pups and
scavenged internal organs. On 3 occasions, marked pups that interacted with sea gulls were
captured 1 or 2 days later, and we discovered they presented fresh perineal wounds that were
absent on previous captures performed 5 to 7 days earlier. The number of Kelp gulls at Guafo
Island fur seal rookery ranged from 33 to 40 animals between seasons and the number of dolphin
gulls ranged from 71 to 84 individuals during different seasons, according to photographic
censuses taken January 15th of every year (table 2).”

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I was one of the original reviewers and the authors have done a very good job in incorporating
my previous comments. I also echo my earlier comments that the authors should be commended
for undertaking this project, and it will contribute both theoretically and practically to our
understanding of such ecological interactions. The authors have also have done a good job in
reanalyzing their data, and their use of model averaging is very well done. I only have a few
minor comments and suggestions for revisions.
The authors are correct that the Chi squared test is commonly used, however, this does not mean
that it is the most appropriate statistical test to be used. The authors have changed some of their
analyses from Chi squared tests to other, in my opinion, more appropriate analyses, and have left
others. The authors have a very powerful dataset, and more robust analytical methods allow the
authors to more effectively identify trends in their data. That being said, their continued use of
Chi squared tests while not the most effective method of analysis, is appropriate and therefore its
use does not preclude this manuscript from publication.
16
The manuscript still has several grammatical errors. I suggest the authors have a colleague read it
closely.
I fundamentally disagree with the authors when they write: “…. would like to ask the editor to
please confirm that those files are correctly attached to the manuscript since they can be critical
for the proper evaluation of the statistical methods used.” In response to my request to provide
more information, the authors have provided two supplemental tables. In my view this is not the
proper use of supplemental material. The information provided in these tables are fundamental
to understanding the analyses conducted by the authors. This information must be easily
accessible in the main paper if the analyses are to be properly understood. These tables should be
moved from supplemental material to the paper itself.
The authors do a good job explaining in their response to the revisions as to how they calculated
power. However, they still only mention this in the discussion, and do not describe how it was
calculated. How this power was calculated needs to be detailed in the methods.
AICc the second C needs to be in subscript throughout the manuscript
I am very confused by what the authors mean when they write “A delta AICc of two was
considered significant but we provide and discuss results from all the models that performed
within a range of delta AICc of 7.” Does this mean that the candidate suite of top-ranked models
were those within 7AICC units of the top-ranked model? This needs to be clarified. Further, this
is not discussed in the manuscript at all, just the response to revisions. This must be included in
the manuscript itself.

ociate Editor Comments to Author:
ments to the Author:
r Dr. Seguel,
ve now received comments from two expert reviewers regarding your manuscript. As you will see their
ions were rather divergent, but both agreed that your manuscript provides a useful contribution to the
ature. Reviewer 1, however, made a very compelling case regarding your statistics and the conclusions
can be drawn from them. Given that the results can (and very well may) change after re-analysis my
sion is to reject your paper but allow for resubmission after addressing these extremely important
es. Moreover, I want to personally echo the point made by Reviewer 1 that the title is inappropriate for
(or any other) journal, and that you should remove the lead in "Do not pick my butt" from the title.
ponse: We have reviewed the manuscript and made proper changes. All statistical analyses were
ormed again using approaches and tests suggested by reviewer 2. There were no major changes in the
rence made out the new results, beside a little different interpretation based on one of the binomial
ession models. More detail of those analyses are provided throughout the text as well as in the
plementary materials. Regarding the later, I’m not familiar with the review system of RSOS, and what
of files are sent to the reviewers but apparently in the previous version of the manuscript
plementary files and the supporting data were not available for reviewer 2. I think I did everything
perly to upload those files in the previous version. I would like to ask the editor to please confirm that
e files are correctly attached to the manuscript since they can be critical for the proper evaluation of the
istical methods used.

nds on fur seal pups. The authors should be commended for the scope of the work involved in this
ect, and the behaviours observed in this study are interesting both from a practical and theoretical
pective. Unfortunately, the authors have not provided enough information in their methods or results to
ble me to properly assess the validity of their statistical analyses, nor their interpretation of them.
her, the authors used “step-wise regression,” a method of model selection that has long since been

found the “don’t pick my butt” part of the title too informal. Such a title is great for a poster or
ference presentation, but I would remove it from the peer-reviewed article.
ponse: the words “do not pick my butt” have been removed from the title.

ponse: The manuscript has been re-reviewed and typographical and grammatical errors corrected.
have strong reservations regarding the author’s use of the Chi Square, and the Mann-Whitney Tests.
se analyses are neither the most robust nor appropriate methods available. A more refined analysis that
er takes into account the spatiotemporal scale of the data could be done using either an ANOVA or a
. Due to what I assume are unequal sample sizes between seasons, a regression is likely the best
ce; however, as there is only a single factor, an ANOVA (even one using Type I Sums of Squares) would
be appropriate. Usage of more appropriate statistical tests may result in radically different results.

ponse: Following approaches recommended in some of the literature referred by the reviewer (Anderson
l. 2000, Burnham & Anderson 2002, Burnham et al. 2011) we fitted several binomial GLMs using in the
al model predictors that could have had a significant effect in the presentation of perineal wounds based
he species biology and medical principles. In this new approach we included predictors previously not
sidered such as the differential numbers of leukocytes rather than the total white blood cell counts only.
approach and the inclusion of new predictors yielded different results compared to those in the GLM in
original manuscript, however the evidence for the effect of one of the factors (anemia, Hg) remained
ng. We used AICc and AICc weight for initial model scoring and since several models yielded similar
es model averaging was performed in the models, however predictability of the averaged model versus
top models did not change drastically. More details of the output of regression and selected models are
vided in supplementary tables 1 and 2.
suggest the authors use AICc instead of AIC. AICc is corrected for small sample sizes, and what
stitutes a small sample size will vary based upon the data collected. However, AICc converges with AIC
ufficiently high sample sizes. Therefore, there is no downside to using AICc. I suggest the authors refer

he authors have not provided enough information to assess the appropriateness of any of their analyses.
t are the sample sizes of each season? Are factors fixed? Random? Are variables continuous? Discrete?
screte were they coded using deviation coding in the regression? What <U+2206>AIC was used to differentiate
ween models (2 is standard but 7 is increasingly being argued for)? What was done when models
ormed equally well? In all cases not enough information has been provided to properly evaluate these
lyses, nor to confirm the author’s interpretation of them.
ponse: sample sizes have been indicated in the table 1 and regarding the regression analyses the
inal data set was provided as supplementary file with details on type of variables, sample sizes per
son, etc. For regression, factors were random and variables continuous (e.g. number of bands,
oglobin concentration) and discrete with only two categories (e.g. sex, coughing(yes,no)). For
gorical variables dummy coding was used. A delta AICc of two was considered significant but we provide
discuss results from all the models that performed within a range of delta AICc of 7. In the current
ion of the manuscript we do not make assumptions on a single model but in the information provided by
best candidate models based on AICc. Additionally we averaged the top 10 models and compared
ormance with the individual models finding not dramatic difference in the inference dragged from their
put.
pecific to the regression the authors need to provide more information. A table must be provided
wing the differences in model performance. This table needs to include the number of variables, the AIC
AICC), R2, etc. This information is not provided anywhere in the manuscript, thus the authors offer no
ence that the model they have selected is indeed the best. The authors also need to provide a second
e providing more information regarding the model they select as the best. This table should include the
ficients of each variable, the p value, the 95% CI, etc. Again, as this information is missing, we have no
of evaluating the performance of this model.
ponse: Part of this information was provided in supplementary table 1 in the original manuscript. In the
version of the manuscript we provide two supplementary tables including outputs for 10 different
els and an averaged model. These tables contain the information solicited but since we performed
mial GLMs, R2 values cannot be computed and we preferred not to report pseudo R2 values (such as
adden's).
or the analyses with small sample sizes, ensure the language in the Discussion reflects the low power
ability to extrapolate
ponse: Regarding interpretation of new statistical analyses the following paragraph has been added to
discussion “The statistical regression performed suggest that anemia and higher number of
ds are the most consistent factors associated with increased likelihood of perineal wounds in
up. Although other indicators of hookworm disease such as number of parasite eggs in the
es and bloody diarrhea were not significant factors affecting the likelihood of perineal wounds
obably due to low sample size and smaller effect compared to anemia), the observational and
erimental evidence in the studied population indicate that anemia is caused by hookworm,
cinaria sp, infection [16, 17, Seguel et al submitted].”
Page 12 Lines 12/13: How did you calculate this power?
ponse: The power was calculated using the “pwr.chisq.test” function of the “pwr” package for R.3.2.0.
r.chisq.test(w=0.1,N=147,df=1,sig.level = 0.05)). The W effect (size effect) of 0.1 was selected based
he observed prevalence of perineal wounds in the population. I also re-analyzed the data using a GLM to
the effect of treatment in the presence (1) or absence (0) of perineal wounds and the result were also
-significant at alpha=0.05. However p-values were much lower compared to the Chi-square test (p-
es=0.088 compared to the previously reported 0.20). Chi-square results are still reported in the paper
n the widespread use of this test to analyze outcomes in this type of experiments and the possibility to
ort specific power values associated to the test.

manuscript titled "Do not pick my butt: Kelp and dolphin gulls cause perineal wounds in South American
seal pups (Arctocephalus australis)." is a good study presenting a previously undocumented relationship
ween fur seal pups and gulls. I am happy with the overall design of this study and the Introduction,
ults and Discussion sections are clear and thorough. Besides the one "major" comment I have regarding
different role of the two gull species and its possible impact, I have only few minor comments which I
e given below. If these comments are answered adequately, I can gladly support the publications of this
er.
or comment:
have observed differences between the two gull species in the way they interact with the pups (e.g.
hin gulls are more aggressive). Is it possible that due to these differences either gull species has a more
ere impact on the pups? Given the low number of observed interactions this may be hard to assess, but I
ld appreciate some level of speculation into this. It does seem rather important given the context of this
uscript.
ponse: We observed a more aggressive interaction of Dolphin gulls with the fur seal pups. Therefore, it is
y that dolphin gulls cause a more severe damage in the pups’ perineal area, however it is hard to probe
n the way our data was collected. Since the interaction always involved the two seagull species all pups
mined after seagull interaction had suffered from both seagull species effects. We included the following
tence in the discussion to suggest that differential effect of seagull species is possible but at the moment
ot possible to confirm:
e 13, Lines 20-32: “These differences in behavior between dolphin and kelp gulls could also
ly a differentiated role in the cause of perineal wounds of fur seal pups. It is possible that
phin gulls cause more and more severe perineal wounds compared to kelp gulls, however the
ure of our observations and assessment of fur seal pups did not allow to test this hypothesis.”
or comments:
e 2, line 32: Here it says "(11/46)" when in fact the real total number of infected individuals given in the
ults section and in Table 1 was 49. Also, it should be made more clear what the number 49 actually
ns. At the moment it can be mistaken for the total number of inspected individuals.
ponse: The actual number of affected animals was 47. The number has been corrected in the table and
ughout the table and is in accordance with the supplementary files (per.wounds.data.xlsx) provided.
in parenthesis number (11/47), has been replaced by the sentence” 23% of affected animals”
e 2, line 36: Instead of "however", perhaps "and" would be more suitable?
ponse: The sentence has been rewritten as “causing perineal wounds during this process”
e 5, line 17: Did defecation occur every time a pup was handled? If not, how was this taken into
ount when assessing the presence of blood in feces?
ponse: defecation did not happen in all pups when these were handled but in over 70% of them (due to
al swabbing probably). In the pups that did not defecate the presence of blood was assessed based on
rests of blood present in the fecal samples collected (with lubricated swabs) every time a pup was
tured. Overall these assessments are not very specific or sensitive and a significant portion of pups with
orrhagic diarrhea could have been missed. We highlighted this in the discussion, page xx, line “”.
itionally in material and methods, page 5, line 20 we added the following sentence” or presented
nificant amount of semi-digested blood mixed with feces in the fecal swab”
e 11, line 34: Replace the word "shit" with feces.
ponse: The actual word should be “shift”.. it is a typo error that has been corrected (page 12, line 2, “left
t)
e 13, line 43: instead of "learn" use "learned".
ponse: Changed according to the reviewer’ suggestion
le 1:
haps you could add a summary to the bottom to sum up the number and give an overall average for
valence? E.g. 49 infected, 668 total, 7% average prevalence(49/668).
ld it be possible to add intensities into this table or at least tell in the Results section what was the
imum number of ulcers observed?
ponse: The summary row has been added to table 1.
he first paragraph of the results section we indicate the proportion of the animals affected by just 1 or 2
ll ulcers and the proportion of animals with severe lesions which consisted of up to 5 small ulcers or 1 or
rge (>2cm diameter). We have added the sentence “while in the remaining 20-30% of the cases
lesions consisted in 3 to 5 ulcers in the perineal area”
plementary files:
he "perineal_wounds_safs" file, there are only 93 rows of data. What are these particular individuals and
re is the rest of the data? You did examine 668 individuals and I would like to see a data file including all
e individuals.
ponse: The supplementary file containing our data set include information from 92 pups. Forty seven of
e pups were affected by perineal wounds while the other 45 correspond to the selected age-matched
trols. While information for the other 557 pups is available we did not include most of that information
. weight, sex, health parameters) in the analyses presented in this study. All the inference was done
ed in the analyses performed in the data set provided and we only used the total number of pups
tured to calculate prevalence. I would prefer not to share our complete data set including the 557 pups
evaluated in this study since that data set contain sensible information such as weights and health
ameters which have not been published yet. Given the charismatic nature of the studied species and the
wing interests in factors that could affect the health of these species such large data set could be
used. For instance, in 2016 there were major environmental conflicts in the area surrounding Guafo
nd, due to closure of fisheries due to red tides and potential contamination by salmon farms. If our data
is used by any of the parts in conflict, conclusions could be drawn without knowing the details of data
ection procedures, coding, etc and therefore misleading information released to any of the interested
ies. We report our findings annually to the Chilean Fisheries service and they are aware of yearly
nges and major findings, but is up to them the proper use of that information. Our complete data set is
g analyzed and it will be public once our findings based on this data are peer-reviewed and published.

Several edits - “This behavior usually occurred right after pup defecation, when Kelp and Dolphin gulls
aged in consumption of pup’s feces and picked the perineal areas spotted with fecal material. Kelp gulls
ally interacted first with fur seal pups. After Kelp gulls had consumed some feces or picked the perineal
3 to 5 times, they retired, leaving pups vulnerable to interactions with Dolphin gulls that would actively
sume the remaining feces and aggressively pick the perineal area (Figures 3a and 3b). The response of
s was usually limited to move away from the area or try to bite seagulls, however they never succeeded in
r attempts in any recorded interaction. On rare occasions (n=6), Dolphin gulls approached sleeping pups
picked the perineal region in a similar manner to how they approach dead pups and scavenged internal
ns. On 3 occasions, marked pups that interacted with sea gulls were captured 1 or 2 days later, and we
overed they presented fresh perineal wounds that were absent on previous captures performed 5 to 7 days
ier. The number of Kelp gulls at Guafo Island fur seal rookery ranged from 33 to 40 animals between
sons and the number of dolphin gulls ranged from 71 to 84 individuals during different seasons, according
hotographic censuses taken January 15th of every year (table 2).”

ments to the Author(s)
s one of the original reviewers and the authors have done a very good job in incorporating my previous
ments. I also echo my earlier comments that the authors should be commended for undertaking this
ect, and it will contribute both theoretically and practically to our understanding of such ecological
ractions. The authors have also have done a good job in reanalyzing their data, and their use of model
raging is very well done. I only have a few minor comments and suggestions for revisions.
authors are correct that the Chi squared test is commonly used, however, this does not mean that it is the
t appropriate statistical test to be used. The authors have changed some of their analyses from Chi
ared tests to other, in my opinion, more appropriate analyses, and have left others. The authors have a very
erful dataset, and more robust analytical methods allow the authors to more effectively identify trends in
r data. That being said, their continued use of Chi squared tests while not the most effective method of
lysis, is appropriate and therefore its use does not preclude this manuscript from publication.
manuscript still has several grammatical errors. I suggest the authors have a colleague read it closely.
damentally disagree with the authors when they write: “…. would like to ask the editor to please confirm
those files are correctly attached to the manuscript since they can be critical for the proper evaluation of
statistical methods used.” In response to my request to provide more information, the authors have
ided two supplemental tables. In my view this is not the proper use of supplemental material. The
rmation provided in these tables are fundamental to understanding the analyses conducted by the authors.
information must be easily accessible in the main paper if the analyses are to be properly understood.
se tables should be moved from supplemental material to the paper itself.
authors do a good job explaining in their response to the revisions as to how they calculated power.
ever, they still only mention this in the discussion, and do not describe how it was calculated. How this
er was calculated needs to be detailed in the methods.
c the second C needs to be in subscript throughout the manuscript
very confused by what the authors mean when they write “A delta AICc of two was considered significant
we provide and discuss results from all the models that performed within a range of delta AICc of 7.” Does
mean that the candidate suite of top-ranked models were those within 7AICC units of the top-ranked
el? This needs to be clarified. Further, this is not discussed in the manuscript at all, just the response to
sions. This must be included in the manuscript itself.
cw is the accepted abbreviation for AICC weights
ponse:
manuscript has been reviewed by three of the co-authors (including two native English speakers) and an
itional colleague. Furthermore, we have incorporated the detailed corrections of the Editor.
supplementary tables have been moved to the body of the manuscript as suggested by the reviewer.
e Methods section, page 8, 1st paragraph we added the following sentences “The power of this experiment
calculated with the “pwr” package of “R.3.2.0” statistical software (R core development team), and using
as effect size, based in the known prevalence of perineal wounds in the studied population (~10%).”
acronyms “AICc” and “AICcw” have been corrected throughout the text and in the tables.
ally we considered a delta AIC of 2 as significant to keep evaluating models. However in the first revision
re-analysis of data we used a delta AIC of seven and we averaged and based our inference using the
els that were within that range. We reworded the material and methods section, page 7, last paragraph as
w “Akaike information criteria with correction for small sample size (AICc, “MuMIn” package, “R 3.2.0”
stical software) (Table 1). Additionally, the models with a delta AICc =7 when compared to the model with the
est AICc, were averaged and predictability compared with individual models through mean absolute error (MAE,
le 2)”
Additionally, in the discussion section we have added the following sentence to enforce the range of delta
c that were considered “although predictors such as “blood in feces”, “number of eosinophils” and “number
ands” had a significant effect in some of the models with a delta AICc of less than 7.”
