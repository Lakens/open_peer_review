This is a very nice manuscript. Electron transfer at the interface of organic dyes and
semiconducting materials is a very important topic in material sciences and engineering. In this
paper, the authors compared the electron injection and recombination on TiO2 nanoparticles and
ZnP nanorods sensitized by phthalocyanine (Pc). They found interesting photodynamics on the
processes, which would attract significant attention from general readers. I recommend the
publication in Open Science after considering the following comment.
1) They found that the charge recombination on TiO2 is faster than on ZnO, contrary to the
previous results. Moreover, relatively large number of the injected electrons recombines with the
Pc radical cation on the surface within a few tens of picoseconds in the case of TiO2. On the other
hand, the photovoltaic performance of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is known to
be much lower than that of TiO2-based DSSCs. The discrepancy should be explained rationally in
the manuscript.

In this manuscript, the authors present spectroscopic study on the electron injection and
recombination behavior of ZnO and TiO2 based DSSCs. The study is well-designed and sheds
light on the fundamental difference between these two materials. I would like to accept the
manuscript for publication in RSOS, with the following comments properly addressed.

(1) In Figure 2, should the substrate for TiO2 be FTO not ITO? Please also explain briefly why
TiO2 and ZnO are fabricated on different substrates. Since no full solar cells are involved in the
manuscript, what role dose FTO/ITO coating substrate play in the study?
(2) Considering the nature of the study, it is very beneficial if the authors could introduce how
time resolved transient spectra works and how to interpret the data (e.g. decay time, delta A, etc).
(3) The meaning of Figure 3 is not adequately explained. Please explain in more detail.
(4) The characterization (XRD, etc.) of the materials examined in the paper is needed for other
researchers to compare.

Dear William King,

which were all taken into account in the revised manuscript. We hope that the revised version

Sincerely yours,
Answers to Reviewers and summary of the changes are collected below starting with the original
Reviewer comments.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very nice manuscript. Electron transfer at the interface of organic dyes and semiconducting
materials is a very important topic in material sciences and engineering. In this paper, the authors
compared the electron injection and recombination on TiO2 nanoparticles and ZnP nanorods
sensitized by phthalocyanine (Pc). They found interesting photodynamics on the processes, which
would attract significant attention from general readers. I recommend the publication in Open
Science after considering the following comment.
1) They found that the charge recombination on TiO2 is faster than on ZnO, contrary to the previous
results. Moreover, relatively large number of the injected electrons recombines with the Pc radical
cation on the surface within a few tens of picoseconds in the case of TiO2. On the other hand, the
photovoltaic performance of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is known to be much
lower than that of TiO2-based DSSCs. The discrepancy should be explained rationally in the
manuscript.
Answer: Although it seems to be a common knowledge that ZnO-base DSSCs are much less
efficient than TiO2-based ones, a fair comparison of two materials is a challenging task. One
such attempt was done by Grätzel and co-authors [4] and it shows that both semiconductors
perform equally well, though each material has its own advantages. In real solar cells the
speed of hole transfer from the sensitizer to a hole transporting material determines how slow
the charge recombination at the interface must be to have no detrimental effect on the overall
efficiency, Our study shows that this hole transfer must take place in few tens of picoseconds
or faster in the case of TiO2 interface. We added a short comment on this point in the end of
Discussion. (page 9)

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, the authors present spectroscopic study on the electron injection and
recombination behavior of ZnO and TiO2 based DSSCs. The study is well-designed and sheds light
on the fundamental difference between these two materials. I would like to accept the manuscript
for publication in RSOS, with the following comments properly addressed.
(1) In Figure 2, should the substrate for TiO2 be FTO not ITO? Please also explain briefly why
TiO2 and ZnO are fabricated on different substrates. Since no full solar cells are involved in the
manuscript, what role dose FTO/ITO coating substrate play in the study?
Answer: Thank you, the figure caption is corrected. We have used standard procedures developed
previously for TiO2 nanoparticle films and ZnO nanorod arrays. FTO has an advantage of
higher conductivity compared to ITO, but otherwise no difference was reported for these two
transparent conducting oxides in DSSC applications to the best of our knowledge. However,
surface morphologies of commercially available ITO and FTO substrates are different, and
nanorod growth procedures are slightly different. Since we had well developed nanorod
growth routing for ITO substrates, we preferred to stay with this routine, as the electrode
conductivity is not important for this experiment. Corresponding comments and two
references were added in Methods and Materials section to address the question. (page 3)
(2) Considering the nature of the study, it is very beneficial if the authors could introduce how time
resolved transient spectra works and how to interpret the data (e.g. decay time, delta A, etc).
Answer: Short explanations were added in Results section paragraphs 2 and 3. (page 4-5)
(3) The meaning of Figure 3 is not adequately explained. Please explain in more detail.
Answer: Figure 3 caption was extended. We also reworked the text presenting the figure in the first
paragraph of Results. (page 4)
(4) The characterization (XRD, etc.) of the materials examined in the paper is needed for other
researchers to compare.
Answer: This research is based on previously developed sample preparations routines and brings
nothing new in this field. We have added few more details on the sample preparation and two
more references to the previous studies devoted to the preparation and structural
characterization in Methods and Materials section Sample subsection. (page 3)
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) semiconductors have similar band gap positions but
TiO2 performs better as an anode material in dye-sensitized solar cell applications. We compare two
electrodes made of TiO2 nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods sensitized by an aggregation-protected
phthalocyanine derivative using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. In agreement with
previous studies, the primary electron injection is two times faster on TiO2, but contrary to the
previous results the charge recombination is slower on ZnO. This can be due to morphology
differences and ability of the injected electrons to travel much farther from the sensitizer cation in
ZnO nanorods.
