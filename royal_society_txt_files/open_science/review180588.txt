I found this contribution to be a thorough and interesting DFT study by the authors on the
addition sequences and analyses/predictions of trifluoromethylated Gd@C60 (up to five CF3
functional group can be added) and the effect of the encapsulated Gd atom on those processes. It
is certainly a timely report and I found it to be well written. I expect this contribution to be of
interest to theoreticians and experimentalists.
I suggest to publish after consideration of the minor comments below:
Figure 2
-The reaction listed vertically on the binding energy axis is already described in the caption and is
somewhat difficult to read. Perhaps this can be adjusted or removed for clairity?
Figure 6
-Should "tetrafluoromethylated" actually be "trifluoromethylated" in the first line of the caption?
-The "shaded backgrounds" to denote the stable end points of a reaction pathway are difficult to
visually identify. However, this might be a result of the resolution of the current image.
The authors predict that there should only be one clearly stable species/isomer, namely,
Gd@C60(CF3)4, as a positive ion. Is that consistent with any experimental data (e.g., in the
author's in press report, Ref 5)?

Title: Determining addition pathways and stable isomers for CF3 functionalization of endohedral
Gd@C60
by: Chris Ewels, Jeremy Rio, Hisanori Shinohara, Mark Rayson, Patrick Briddon
The authors use density functional theory structure optimization and total energy calculations to
determine the thermodynamically most probable isomers of Gd@C60(CF3)n for up to n=5 by
sequential chemical adsorption of CF3 radicals on the Gd encapsulating C60 molecule. The
manuscript is a detailed description of the theoretical part of a recent Nature communication. The
assumptions of the work and results are adequately discussed and the method used in this work
is acceptable. The results, especially metalocene model, may be helpful in understanding
functionalized metalofullerenes. Therefore, I recommend the publication of this manuscript in
Royal Society Open Science after the authors consider the following points:
1. The trifluoromethylation of metalofullerenes is relatively old research subject, and there is a
large number of works related to this topic, i.e. the works by Darwish et al. However, the authors
seem to have cited only their own works. A more comprehensive discussion of the related works
and their findings must be provided. The authors should compare their theoretical calculations to
not only their own experimental results but also other published data.
2. At the beginning of Page 2, the authors correlated HOMO-LUMO gap value to successful
crystallization and characterization. The link is not apparent and not straightforward. The
sentence in the manuscript should be clarified.
3. The authors use 0.1 eV as a criterion for accepting bifurcation of the evolution path. How it was
determined should be mentioned. The value must be related to an energy scale in the problem,
and should be given as a dimensionless parameter.
4. The authors argue that the synthesis is more likely to occur sequentially without allowing
surface rearrangement. This assumption relies on a previous success of this method. In arc-
discharge, it is hard to believe that it is sequential. However, the synthesis environment has
enough thermal and electronic excitations to search for the thermodynamically most favorable
configuration. The sequential adsorption allows us to have an educated guess on the most
probable structure since the bonding preferences are already built in the predecessor structure.
5. The authors often use energetics as the sole criterion for the stability. The authors should
clearly state why and how they use only the total energy for determining the stability.
6. The authors have chosen a rather old functional. This chose should be justified in the
manuscript. It is confusing that there is a GGA folder in ESI.
7. In Figure 1, the authors should provide also a spin polarization contour plot for the sake f
completeness.
8. Throughout the manuscript, the reaction enthalpy is defined and mentioned. However, the y-
label in Figure 2 is binding energy, which is not defined in the text. The text and the label should
be in accord.
9. Does the total spin play any role in stabilizing odd numbered additions? How does the frontier
orbitals differ for odd and even numbered additions? The authors should comment on this in the
manuscript.
4
10. In energy barrier calculation, the number of nudge points around the saddle point seems to be
not dense enough. The peak is too sharp. How does it affect their results?
11. There are isomers with even number of additions for this system in the literature. If the
system definitely finds its thermodynamically most probable state, as argued by the authors,
what is the reason for reported even number of additions in the literature?
12. The authors should spend more effort to compare their results to previous theoretical works,
such as The Journal of Physical Chemistry A Vol 117 Page 13009 (2013). The list of related papers
may be extended beyond what is provided here.

Dear Tom and Hazel,
Many thanks for your positive reply and detailed reading and comments from the two
referees. Attached below are point by point replies, in attachment also the revised document
with all modifications made using ‘track changes’. Notably there is a new additional
experimental section now, for this reason two additional co-authors have been added.
Finally I would like to say this is the first time I have received a non-anonymous referee
report, it is very pleasant to reply directly to Savas rather than anonymously!
We hope with these revisions, the article will now be suitable for publication in RSOS as part
of the special thematic issue.

Media Summary:
Carbon cages containing metal atoms were discovered soon after the original C60 discovery.
However most are larger cages, and stable production of metal-C60 cages such as Gd@C60
remained elusive. Recently it was shown that such systems can be stabilized by adding CF3 to
the cage surface. Predicting how many CF3 groups will attach, and to what locations, is a
daunting task, given the enormous number of possibilities. In the current study we use an
automated theoretical method whereby CF3 groups are added sequentially. This successfully
predicts the species seen experimentally, even when they are not the most stable structures
possible.

trifluoromethylated Gd@C60 (up to five CF3 functional group can be added)
and the effect of the encapsulated Gd atom on those processes. It is

I suggest to publish after consideration of the minor comments below:
Figure 2

We have removed this reaction.
Figure 6
-Should "tetrafluoromethylated" actually be "trifluoromethylated" in the
first line of the caption?
Thanks for spotting this, corrected.
-The "shaded backgrounds" to denote the stable end points of a reaction
pathway are difficult to visually identify. However, this might be a result
of the resolution of the current image.
We have additionally put thicker borders around the Schlegel plots of the stable species, hopefully it
is much clearer now.
The authors predict that there should only be one clearly stable
species/isomer, namely, Gd@C60(CF3)4, as a positive ion. Is that consistent
with any experimental data (e.g., in the author's in press report, Ref 5)?
This last referee suggestion was too tempting to let pass. After discussion with our Japanese
colleagues we have included a new experimental section to the paper containing previously
unpublished data (data not in Ref 5 for example) comparing positive- and negative-ion MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry measurements. These exactly demonstrate the labile nature of the 5th CF 3 group
and very nicely confirm our theoretical findings. We thank the referee for the suggestion, which
significantly strengthens the paper.

Title: Determining addition pathways and stable isomers for CF3
functionalization of endohedral Gd@C60
by: Chris Ewels, Jeremy Rio, Hisanori Shinohara, Mark Rayson, Patrick

The authors use density functional theory structure optimization and total
energy calculations to determine the thermodynamically most probable
isomers of Gd@C60(CF3)n for up to n=5 by sequential chemical adsorption of
CF3 radicals on the Gd encapsulating C60 molecule. The manuscript is a
detailed description of the theoretical part of a recent Nature
communication. The assumptions of the work and results are adequately
discussed and the method used in this work is acceptable. The results,
especially metalocene model, may be helpful in understanding functionalized
metalofullerenes. Therefore, I recommend the publication of this manuscript
in Royal Society Open Science after the authors consider the following
points:
1. The trifluoromethylation of metalofullerenes is relatively old research
subject, and there is a large number of works related to this topic, i.e.
the works by Darwish et al. However, the authors seem to have cited only
their own works. A more comprehensive discussion of the related works and
their findings must be provided. The authors should compare their
theoretical calculations to not only their own experimental results but
also other published data.
We are not fully in agreement here. In the current paper our focus is on the trifluoromethylation of
metallofullerenes. We agree that there is extensive existing literature on the trifluoromethylation of
conventional pristine fullerenes, notably C60, but to the best of our knowledge there is very little
available literature concerning metallofullerenes. However we agree with the referee in the sense
that it is useful to also make reference to the functionalisation of the pristine fullerene species, and
so we have included an additional page in the introduction describing these species. Since the
functionalisation behavior is very different to that of the metallofullerene species we have also
included commentary on that in the discussion at the start and end of Section 3.3 and in the
conclusions.
2. At the beginning of Page 2, the authors correlated HOMO-LUMO gap value
to successful crystallization and characterization. The link is not
apparent and not straightforward. The sentence in the manuscript should be
clarified.
HOMO-LUMO gap is commonly used by the fullerene community as an indication of chemical
reactivity and notably stability within the column when performing HPLC separation of the various
species. It is true that the link is not straightforward, we have included a new reference (J. Phys.
Chem. A 103, 7487, 1999) where this is discussed in detail.
3. The authors use 0.1 eV as a criterion for accepting bifurcation of the
evolution path. How it was determined should be mentioned. The value must

be related to an energy scale in the problem, and should be given as a
dimensionless parameter.
0.1 eV represents approximately 15-20% of the binding energy of each CF3 species (2.3kcal/mol).
4. The authors argue that the synthesis is more likely to occur
sequentially without allowing surface rearrangement. This assumption relies
on a previous success of this method. In arc-discharge, it is hard to
believe that it is sequential. However, the synthesis environment has
enough thermal and electronic excitations to search for the
thermodynamically most favorable configuration. The sequential adsorption
allows us to have an educated guess on the most probable structure since
the bonding preferences are already built in the predecessor structure.
This is an interesting point. We fully agree that during the formation the temperatures are extremely
high, and one might expect a thorough investigation for the thermodynamically most preferred
system. However it may also be that in this regime the CF3 groups are also not stable, and/or at
these temperature regimes the CF3 cannot stick to the cage (the energies we are studying here are
the binding enthalpies but the entropy terms will be significant during fullerene formation
temperatures). Thus it may be that the functionalisation is occurring in the outer zones of the arc-
discharge zone where temperatures are lower, and critically, where the fullerene residence times are
very short. Notably if we compare to a recent Nanoletters study by Tomanek et al of
functionalisation La@C60, a similar material, they identify different isomers for n=3 and n=4, in
principle both thermodynamically more stable than those presented here. However these do not
coincide with the n=3 species seen experimentally for Gd@C60, nor is there experimental evidence
for such a stable n=4 species. This suggests that the formation environment is not able to fully
search for the thermodynamically most stable configuration.
This remains a complex and interesting question and not one that it is possible to address within the
confines of this theoretical study (it will be also difficult to resolve experimentally given the extreme
environmental conditions present in the synthesis zone).
5. The authors often use energetics as the sole criterion for the
stability. The authors should clearly state why and how they use only the
total energy for determining the stability.
We take enthalpy difference as an indication of relative stability in large part due to computational
expediency. It is true that this is something of an assumption, although given the similarity in
structural motifs we might expect the difference in entropy between isomers to be small. We note
also that the HOMO-LUMO gap of our stable structures is in general much larger than other isomers
(as discussed in the text), even though this is not used as a selection criterion. We have added a new
paragraph to the method discussing this, and a further paragraph in the results section.
6. The authors have chosen a rather old functional. This chose should be
justified in the manuscript. It is confusing that there is a GGA folder in
ESI.
The GGA folder in ESI is included because we performed some benchmarks with GGA to confirm that
there was no qualitative difference in behavior between GGA and LDA functionals. Indeed we found

almost identical structures and HOMO-LUMO gaps with both functionals, this is now commented on
in the methods section.
The LSDA should be sufficient for this problem, since it normally does a good job of carbon bonding
in the fullerene cage, and although its reproduction of the Gd will not be so strong, since the Gd sits
inside the cage and does not interact directly with the surface functional groups, impact of
inaccuracy of the Gd modelling on the final results is minimized.
7. In Figure 1, the authors should provide also a spin polarization contour
plot for the sake f completeness.
We have added a 3D isosurface plot showing the excess spin-up and spin-down distribution.
8. Throughout the manuscript, the reaction enthalpy is defined and
mentioned. However, the y-label in Figure 2 is binding energy, which is not
defined in the text. The text and the label should be in accord.
The Figure axis label has been modified.
9. Does the total spin play any role in stabilizing odd numbered additions?
How does the frontier orbitals differ for odd and even numbered additions?
The authors should comment on this in the manuscript.
The total spin is not a major factor, the key factor for stabilizing odd- and even- numbered additions
is the odd number of transferred electrons from the Gd (Gd3+) to the fullerene cage, which inverts
the ordering odd/even for open/closed shell structures as compared to pristine fullerenes. This is

10. In energy barrier calculation, the number of nudge points around the
saddle point seems to be not dense enough. The peak is too sharp. How does
it affect their results?
The reaction barrier is essentially used qualitatively in the text to argue that the CF3 will not
spontaneously migrate at room temperature, and hence the exact saddle point value is not critical.
Additionally we have used the climbing nudged elastic band algorithm and the top point should have
climbed towards the true saddle point value. Nonetheless for completeness we have extended this
calculation by more than doubling the total number of points and the new curve is included in the
paper, which is now quite a smooth transition.
11. There are isomers with even number of additions for this system in the
literature. If the system definitely finds its thermodynamically most
probable state, as argued by the authors, what is the reason for reported
even number of additions in the literature?
This is a confusion between CF3 functionalistion of pristine C60 and metallofullerenes as discussed
above. There are not isomers with even numbers of addition seen experimentally in the literature for
this system that we are aware of. With the new bibliography we have now included of non-
metallofullerene data, we have also included a comment, the switch from even (non-

electron transfer from the Gd (commented in the text now).
12. The authors should spend more effort to compare their results to
previous theoretical works, such as The Journal of Physical Chemistry A Vol
117 Page 13009 (2013). The list of related papers may be extended beyond
what is provided here.
Again see the comment above regarding fullerene/metallofullerenes. We have included this JPCA
reference in the literature review of non-metallofullerene functionalisation and thank the referee for
drawing our attention to what is a very interesting article.
