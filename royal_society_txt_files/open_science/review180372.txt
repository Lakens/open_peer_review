Title: Electrokinetic remediation of heavy metals from MSWI fly ash pretreated by nitric acid
This is an interesting paper concerning electrokinetic remediation of HMs from MSWI fly ash is
evaluated after soaking in nitric acid..
The abstract highlights the main factors investigated by the authors. The structure and
organization of the paper need to be improved.
The two main issues that need to be improved are:
1) The introduction is too short. A more extensive literature analysis should be done. Authors
should introduce other metod for recycling/remediation. Here are some examples:
-Electrokinetic stabilization of heavy metals in MSWI fly ash after water washing.
https://doi.org/10.1002/ep.11920
-Soluble salt removal from MSWI fly ash and its stabilization for safer disposal and recovery as
road basement material. 2012. Waste Management. 27
-Recycling of MSWI fly ash by means of cementitious double step cold bonding pelletization:
Technological assessment for the production of lightweight artificial aggregates. 2015. Journal of
Hazardous Materials
-Manufacture of artificial aggregate using MSWI bottom ash. 2011.Waste Management. 31(2).
Other suggestions:
1. A more complete description of conditions and method would be worthwhile;
2.Conclusions section need to be revised to capture salient points and to emphasize the results
obtained;
Very interesting topic, some parts need to be improved.

This paper investigates electrokinetic remediation of heavy metals from MSWI fly ash pretreated
by nitric acid. The research method has its innovation, and the results may be useful for
electrokinetic remediation of MSWI fly ash. This is an interesting and generally well executed
paper. However, there are some comments on the contents of the manuscript.
1. In abstract, “Finally, it is concluded that … MSWI fly pretreated…”, the “MSWI fly” should be
“MSWI fly ash”.
2. In section 3.1 of this paper, the fly ash were sieved through 200 mesh, however, in section 3.2,
the particle size distributions of fly ash was measured by a laser particle size analyser and the
particles were in the range of 5 - 600 µm. This is confusing for readers who don’t know which
sample is used to be investigated. Therefore, this section should be modified in order to make
your message clearer.
3. In section 4.1.1, “It should be that hydrogen ions reacted with the fly ash and that carbon
dioxide is also generated”. How did you draw this conclusion?
4. In section 4.2.2, “the pH value of fly ash did not change significantly after slaking by nitric acid
solution for 36 hours”. And “the pH values of fly ash pretreated with acid were slight lower than
those of the fly ash that was soaked in the deionized water”. The reasons should be discussed and
analyzed.
5. The properties (or content) of the solution should be investigated after the fly ash was soaked
in the nitric solution/deionized water, in order to better understand the pretreatment role.
6. Some corrections of the English text are required.

Dear reviewer,
We would like to express our sincere appreciation for your careful reading and helpful comments.
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as
the important guiding significance to our researches. We have addressed the points.
Responses to Reviewer #1:
[Comment 1] The introduction is too short. A more extensive literature analysis should be done.
[Answer] Thank you for your helpful comments. We have cited some references (Reference24, 25,
26).
[Comment 2] A more complete description of conditions and method would be worthwhile;
[Answer] Thank you for your suggestion. We have re-written the section 3 (Materials and
Methods) and add some detailed description of conditions and methods.
[Comment 3] Conclusions section need to be revised to capture salient points and to emphasize
the results obtained.
[Answer] Conclusions have been re-written to capture salient points and to emphasize the results.
Responses to Reviewer #2:
[Comment 1] In abstract, “Finally, it is concluded that… MSWI fly pretreated…”, the “MSWI
fly” should be“MSWI fly ash”.
[Answer] Sorry for typing mistakes. We have revised the whole manuscript carefully and tried to
avoid any grammar or typing error.
[Comment 2] In section 3.1 of this paper, the fly ash were sieved through 200 mesh, however, in
section 3.2, the particle size distributions of fly ash was measured by a laser particle size analyser
and the particles were in the range of 5 - 600 µm. This is confusing for readers who don’t know
which sample is used to be investigated. Therefore, this section should be modified in order to
make your message clearer.
[Answer] Thank you for your helpful suggestions. In section 3.2, the particle size distributions of
original MSWI fly ash samples were measured. We found the particles of fly ash size were diverse
and had some larger size particles. Thus, we ground the original fly ash samples for 4 hours with
ball grinding mill and then sieved them through 200-mesh (75 µm) to improve the homogeneity.
We have re-written section 3.1 and section 3.2, and clarified the sieved samples were used to be
investigated.
[Comment 3] In section 4.1.1, “It should be that hydrogen ions reacted with the fly ash and that
carbon dioxide is also generated”. How did you draw this conclusion?
[Answer] Thank you for your helpful suggestions. There are large amount of carbonate exists in
MSWI fly ash. when nitric acid solution are mixed fly ash samples, the bubbling phenomenon is
observed which indicates the emission of carbon dioxide as result of reaction between H- ions and
carbonate. We have modified section 4.1.1 and add a reference (29) to clarify this justice.
[Comment 4] In section 4.2.2, “the pH value of fly ash did not change significantly after slaking
by nitric acid solution for 36 hours”. And “the pH values of fly ash pretreated with acid were
slight lower than those of the fly ash that was soaked in the deionized water”. The reasons should
be discussed and analyzed.
[Answer] Yes, it is true that pH of MSWI fly ash did not change significantly after socking with
nitric acid solution for 36 hours because of high buffering capacity of fly ash. Further elaboration
is discussed in section 4.3.2.
[Comment 5] The properties (or content) of the solution should be investigated after the fly ash
was soaked in the nitric solution/deionized water, in order to better understand the pretreatment
role.
[Answer] Thank you for your helpful comments. The main purposes of pretreatment is to reduce
the buffering capacity of MSWI fly ash and increase the desorption of HM ions. As the higher
desorption releases more ions which migrate towards cathode and precipitated. Consequently,
removal efficiency of HMs is enhanced during electrokinetic remediation. Thus, we think the
changes in pH and macro phenomena of pretreatment may justify this experiment.
[Comment 6] Some corrections of the English text are required.
[Answer] We have revised the whole manuscript carefully to standardize the description.
In all, your comments are quite helpful. And we believe that your suggestions will be a new
subject for future work.
