The manuscript carried out alternating loading and unloading experiments under different
confining pressures and different loading-unloading speeds, alternating the rate of loading-
unloading on the sandstone sample. A new experimental method for obtaining different
experimental curves of loading-unloading speed on the one sample was creatively studied in the
manuscript, and the feasibility of the new method was verified. The experimental method has
certain innovation and practicality, and provides a new idea to eliminate sample dispersion.
However, there are still some things that need minor improvements.
1. It is recommended to provide more detailed information or physical parameters (such as
location, density.) of the sample so that other researchers can judge and understand the work of
the paper.
2. It is best to explain in detail the meaning of <U+25B3>s on the 21st line of page 4, and the meanings of
the lower right corner of Figure 3 and Figure 4 (such as 6(0.1), 6(0.01).).
3. English should be checked again, there are some spelling mistakes in the paper, such as the
semicolon in the abstract, the words after the comma should be lowercase, I suggest a native
English speaker check it English before re-submission.

Appendix A
Comments:
1. The article may be interesting from the point of view of mining and also during any
construction works requiring e.g. tunnel drilling. Considering the practical aspect of the
research, reading the article, I noticed the lack:
- Direct reference to mining. The part of the title of the article is "simulating the change of
mining-induced stress". The authors focused on presenting the result of the experiment,
but without presenting what these research actually bring to mining practice. Do they
have any practical applications? If so, it has not been clearly articulated. The title suggests
that the work is related to mining, but it does not really follow from the content.
- I did not see a clear purpose of research. If the authors consider the text from page 3 19-
21 as a purpose of research ("Through the method of the test, the mechanical of
characteristics of characteristics loading characteristics loading-unloading rates were
more accurately, and the theoretical guidance of rock excavation was more
scientifically"), they maybe should make reconstruction of the title or also purpose of
research. The contents of the article suggest more theoretical and laboratory practical
considerations rather than the impact on mining...
2. I understand that the authors of the article for the purpose of the research use a device
constructed for the analysis of coal containing methane (Triaxial servo-controlled seepage
equipment for thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling of coal containing methane). The article in
which they describe the device (In references No. 29 - It was printed in the Chinese magazine)
is not generally available, so I suggest to include even a brief description of the device (this is
self-made so this is interesting for readers). If this device was made for coal research, why you
decided to apply it to sandstone samples?
3. Sampling - why was this rock chosen? Is a device made for coal suitable for a different rock?
The name has clearly to "coal". Do the authors know the characteristics of the analysed
sandstone. Can you assume this sandstone is fairly homogeneous, as isotropic? Because it
ensures the repeatability of the measurement. The authors write (p.3, 57-58) about "without
visible fractures and cracks by means of photo observation". Which means "photo
observation"? Did you watch it under any microscopic magnification? Did you use any micro-
or only macro analysis ? Were any petrographic analyses carried out? Is composition is known
(skeleton, matrix, cement)? Do you know any physical properties of these rocks?
4. The article contains a fairly wide references review, but it focuses on samples other than
sandstones - the authors write about mechanical properties: coal, marble salt rocks, granite,
migmatite, and even man-made rocks (similar as sandstones but more homogeneous) e.t.c.
But the part about the behaviour of sandstones and research on them is relatively poorly
developed. Sandstones are, after all, very common rocks, especially as rocks accompanying in
mines. Sandstone research has been and is being carried out on a large scale, which is why I
think it is worth reaching deeper into the literature on the mechanical properties of sandstone.
There are a number of works dealing with clastic rocks in the context of strength.
Conclusion:
The article can be printed, but I suggest a deeper analysis of the sandstone references, maybe
ewording the title or purpose of the research, as well as a brief description of the device and method,
explaining why this device was applied to the sandstone. And in the future, a little more emphasis on
he physical and petrographic properties of used samples.

Discussion: Revision at Page 5 Lines 7-Page 5 Lines 14
The sandstone samples of this experiment were taken from the roof of a coal mine in
Chongqing, China. The apparent density ranged from 2237 to 2243 kg/m3. The
mineral composition mainly includes feldspar and quartz. The content of quartz is less
than 75%, and the content of feldspar is more than 25 %, and the amount of cuttings is
less than 25% [42]. The sandstone has a moisture content of 0.44%, an ash content of
96.21%, a volatile content of 3.26%, a fixed carbon of 0.09%, a TOC content of 0.1%,
and a porosity of 4.15%. The sandstone has good homogeneity, small dispersion and
good sampling integrity. The experimental samples were taken from the same intact
large sandstone.
Issue 2: It is best to explain in detail the meaning of <U+25B3>s on the 21st line of page 4,
and the meanings of the lower right corner of Figure 3 and Figure 4 (such as 6(0.1),
6(0.01).).
Discussion: Revision at Page 5 Lines 19-Page 5 Lines 24, Page 6 Lines 21-Page 6
Lines 27 and Page 7 Lines 11-Page 7 Lines 19.
<U+25B3>s: In the second experimental scheme, after the axial pressure is increased by a
certain value, the loading and unloading speed is simultaneously changed. <U+0394>s
represents the speed alternately changing interval with the increase in the axial
pressure value, that is, the load-unloading speed is simultaneously changed every time
the axial pressure is increased by a certain stress value (3 MPa). For example, the
experimental scheme of sample 2-6-1 in Table 1 is that when the axial pressure is 6
MPa of the initial hydrostatic pressure, the load-unloading speed is 0.01 MPa/s, and
when the axial pressure is 9 MPa, the transformation load-unloading speed is 0.1
MPa/ s, when the axial pressure is 12 MPa, the transformation load-unloading speed
is 0.01 MPa/s, then can deduce the rest from this example.
The meanings of the lower right corner of Figure 3 and Figure 4:
6 (0.1) in Fig. 3 indicates a stress-strain curve of sample No. 1-6-2 in experiment
scheme 1, wherein 6 indicates an initial hydrostatic pressure of 6 MPa, and 0.1
indicates the loading-unloading rate of 0.1 MPa/s. 6 (0.01) in Fig. 3 indicates a
stress-strain curve of sample No. 1-6-1 in experiment scheme 1, wherein 6 indicates
an initial hydrostatic pressure of 6 MPa, and 0.01 indicates the loading-unloading rate
of 0.01 MPa/s. Similarly, 7 (0.1), 7 (0.01), 8 (0.1), 8 (0.01) in Fig. 3 can deduce the
rest from these examples, which are only the difference in initial hydrostatic pressure.
6 (0.01<U+2192>0.1) in Fig. 4 indicates the stress-strain curve of sample No. 2-6-1 in the
experimental scheme 2, wherein 6 indicates that the initial hydrostatic pressure is 6
MPa, and (0.01<U+2192>0.1) indicates that the initial loading-unloading rate is 0.01MPa/s,
the conversion loading-unloading speed interval is the time when the axial stress
increases by 3 MPa. For example, when the axial pressure is the initial hydrostatic
pressure of 6 MPa, the loading-unloading speed is 0.01MPa/s, and when the axial
pressure is 9 MPa, the axial compression is changed. The loading-unloading speed is
0.1 MPa/s, and the loading-unloading speed is 0.01 MPa/s when the shaft is pressed to
12 MPa, and goes on with this change until it breaks down. 6 (0.1<U+2192>0.01) in Fig. 4
indicates the stress-strain curve of the sample No. 2-6-2 in the experimental scheme 2,
wherein 6 indicates that the initial hydrostatic pressure is 6 MPa, and (0.1<U+2192>0.01)
indicates that the initial loading-unloading speed is 0.1 MPa/s, the conversion
loading-unloading speed is the time when the axial stress increases by 3MPa. For
example, when the axial pressure is the initial hydrostatic pressure of 6MPa, the
loading-unloading speed is 0.1 MPa/s, and when the axial pressure is 9MPa, the
transformation loading-unloading speed is 0.01 MPa/s, when the axial pressure is 12
MPa, the transformation loading-unloading speed is 0.1 MPa/s, and continues with
this change until it is destroyed. Similarly, 7 (0.01 <U+2192> 0.1), 7 (0.1 <U+2192> 0.01), 8 (0.01
<U+2192> 0.1), 8 (0.1 <U+2192> 0.01) in Fig. 4 can deduce the rest from above examples, which
are only the difference of the initial hydrostatic pressure.
Issue 3: English should be checked again, there are some spelling mistakes in the
paper, such as the semicolon in the abstract, the words after the comma should be
lowercase, I suggest a native English speaker check it English before re-submission.

Thanks to the reviewer's suggestion, we sought the help of the translation company to

Reviewer 2
Issue 1: The article may be interesting from the point of view of mining and also
during any construction works requiring e.g. tunnel drilling. Considering the
practical aspect of the research, reading the article, I noticed the lack:
- Direct reference to mining. The part of the title of the article is "simulating the

were more accurately, and the theoretical guidance of rock excavation was more
scientifically"), they maybe should make reconstruction of the title or also purpose of
research. The contents of the article suggest more theoretical and laboratory
practical considerations rather than the impact on mining...
Discussion: Revision at Page 4 Lines 11- Page 4 Lines 14
Many thanks to the reviewer for your advice. Xie (academician of the Chinese
Academy of Engineering) et al. [39] proposed that the rock mass experienced a
complete kinetic process from the original rock stress, axial stress rise (loading) and
confining pressure reduction (unloading) to failure unloading when mining
underground in front of the working face. The variation of mining stress can be
studied by stress path experiments of rock under loading axial pressure and unloading
confining pressure. The surrounding rock in the mining process is often sedimentary
rock, such as sandstone, mudstone, limestone and other rocks. Therefore, we have
proposed a new type of loading and unloading experiment to simulate the change of
mining stress. The next step of our research is to analyze the correspondence between
the mining stress in the laboratory simulation and the mining stress change caused by
mining in the actual engineering problems.
Issue 2: I understand that the authors of the article for the purpose of the research
use a device constructed for the analysis of coal containing methane (Triaxial
servo-controlled seepage equipment for thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling of coal
containing methane). The article in which they describe the device (In references No.
29 - It was printed in the Chinese magazine) is not generally available, so I suggest to
include even a brief description of the device (this is self-made so this is interesting
for readers). If this device was made for coal research, why you decided to apply it to
sandstone samples?
Discussion: Revision at Page 4 Lines 20- Page 4 Lines 26
The revision modifies the English reference for the instrument (It turned out to be [29],
now it is [40]) and introduces the instrument briefly. The maximum axial pressure of
the device can reach 100 MPa. The maximum confining pressure can reach 10 MPa.
The maximum gas pressure can be up to 2 MPa and the test temperature can be up to
90 °C. Axial loads enable force control and displacement control. Parameters such as
stress, deformation, gas pressure, temperature and flow can be collected automatically.
The device can be applied to coal and other rock experiments, and can carry out
mechanical and seepage experiments under different in-situ stress fields (confining
pressure and axial pressure), different pressures and different geothermal fields.
Therefore, the sandstone samples were tested using this device. Although the
experimental instrument was developed for coal research, in fact the instrument can
be applied to all rocks (Zhang D. M. [25] carried out sandstone experiments with this
instrument). Therefore, the instrument was applied to this sandstone experiment.
Issue 3: Sampling - why was this rock chosen? Is a device made for coal suitable for
a different rock? The name has clearly to "coal". Do the authors know the
characteristics of the analysed sandstone. Can you assume this sandstone is fairly
homogeneous, as isotropic? Because it ensures the repeatability of the measurement.
The authors write (p.3, 57-58) about "without visible fractures and cracks by means
of photo observation". Which means "photo observation"? Did you watch it under any
microscopic magnification? Did you use any micro- or only macro analysis ? Were
any petrographic analyses carried out? Is composition is known (skeleton, matrix,
cement)? Do you know any physical properties of these rocks?
Discussion: Revision at Page 5 Lines 7- Page 5 Lines 14
The surrounding rock in the mining process is often sedimentary rock, such as
sandstone, mudstone, limestone and other rocks. The main purpose of this manuscript
is to explore new methods for performing different loading and unloading rates on the
same rock. In order to verify whether this method is effective, it is more ideal to use
relatively homogeneous rock, and the homogeneity of sandstone is better. Therefore
the manuscript uses sandstone as an experimental sample.
The sandstone samples of this experiment were taken from the roof of a coal mine in
Chongqing, China. The apparent density ranged from 2237 to 2243 kg/m3. The
mineral composition mainly includes feldspar and quartz. The content of quartz is less
than 75%, and the content of feldspar is more than 25 %, and the amount of cuttings is
less than 25% [42]. The sandstone has a moisture content of 0.44%, an ash content of
96.21%, a volatile content of 3.26%, a fixed carbon of 0.09%, a TOC content of 0.1%,
and a porosity of 4.15%. The sandstone has good homogeneity, small dispersion and
good sampling integrity. The experimental samples were taken from the same intact
large sandstone.
Unfortunately, our laboratory lacks precision instruments such as scanning electron
microscopes. Therefore, microscopic analysis experiments are not performed on the
samples. Only the photos are viewed. Next, we will seek means to carry out relevant
microscopic analysis experiments.
Issue 4: The article contains a fairly wide references review, but it focuses on
samples other than sandstones - the authors write about mechanical properties: coal,
marble salt rocks, granite, migmatite, and even man-made rocks (similar as
sandstones but more homogeneous) e.t.c. But the part about the behaviour of
sandstones and research on them is relatively poorly developed. Sandstones are, after
all, very common rocks, especially as rocks accompanying in mines. Sandstone
research has been and is being carried out on a large scale, which is why I think it is
worth reaching deeper into the literature on the mechanical properties of sandstone.
There are a number of works dealing with clastic rocks in the context of strength.
Discussion: Revision at Page 2 Lines 34- Page 3 Lines 32
Less reference to the sandstone literature is my negligence, thanks to the reviewer's
reminders and suggestions. After a detailed review of the literature, I added several
articles on sandstone loading and unloading studies as references, ranging from [22]
to [31]
