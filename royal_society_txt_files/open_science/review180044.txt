General Comment
The paper analyzed the heel impact forces in two conditions (barefoot and minimally shod –
sandals) during walking among indigenous farmers - the Tarahumara and urban Americans. It is
a well-written paper, with proper methodological design and deeper discussion. It is grounded
on an original and interesting subject that needs further consistent data to advance in the state of
art. The major topic investigated is a still controversy in the literature deserved to be investigated.
The population is definitely worth to be investigated due to its uniqueness and a real native
sandal-walking people. The paper will certainly add to the field of Biomechanics of shoes and
locomotion. There are only few comments that I addressed to improve clarity in some
descriptions throughout the manuscript. Please, consider reviewing them.
Specific comments
Introduction
1. L. 23-47 page 6 - Avoid repetition – “habitually wear cushioned, supportive shoes…” are
mentioned twice in the same paragraph.
2. Page 5 -6: I’d rather recommend posting your question / objective more clearly instead
of describing what you have analyzed or assessed.
Methods
1. Page 7 - Please, consider adding sample size power calculation, at least a posteriori
calculus.
3. Page 7 - The sample was not age-matched. To match a sample by age or body mass or
any other variable, you should recruit one subject from the second group with the same
anthropometric/demographic characteristic to the other that has just been recruited from the first
group. And this was not the case. And it is reflected in the age confident interval differences
between groups, as well as the time difference in the recruitment.
4. Page 8 – 1st paragraph – Please add more information on the Pressure measurement
protocol: number os trials, steps prior to plate contact, steps post plate contact, time of
habituation to the platform and to the new sandals wore by the Americans, rest, platform
leveling, among others.
5. Page 9 – “Values were transformed into units of body mass…” – values were normalized
to body mass.
Results
1. Item 4.2 = Please report the Effect size or Mean Difference considering it is a quantitative
measure of the strength of a phenomenon. Sometime, only showing the statistical significance (p-
value) does not always point to a clinically relevant difference. Although the p-value can be a
useful statistical measure, it is commonly misused and misinterpreted (Wasserstein and Lazar,
2016). Instead of using % statistics, the use of effect size is an alternative way to look at the
results, sometimes even more important than p-values or %, because it shows a clinical and
meaningful difference. Whereas statistical tests of significance tell us the likelihood that result
3
differ from chance expectations, effect-size measurements tell us the relative magnitude of the
mean differences (Browner, 2006; Thalheimer and Cook, 2002). For example: what does 2% of
more dorsiflexed ankles mean? Even if it was a significant difference between shoe conditions,
what is the real meaning of such a small difference? For instance: “ankle plantarflexion was 7-8%
greater”. What does this difference mean in relevance? Or: page 13 – “…differed little between
Tarahumara and Americans…”
Discussion
1. About the issue raised in the results section (#1), the affirmative sentence in the
discussion (1st paragraph, page 14) need to be reconsidered in the light of the effect size. When
attesting that “In both populations, the effects of minimal footwear on impact peaks were due, at
least in part, to the combination of individuals’ more dorsiflexed, and hence less compliant,
ankles during the time of impact and to greater effective mass than in barefoot walking”, you are
strongly relying on a result with very small power. I would recommend you to be more cautious
due to the meaningless difference of 2% of ankle flexion.
2. I would recommend to improve the discussion about the stiffness of the shoe and its
influence on kinetic measures and how it did influence your measures – last statement in the
paper (summary). Please, you might find interesting the paper: Onodera et al. PeerJ, v. 5, p.
e3026, 2017.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
Wallace and others examined the kinetics and kinematics of walking barefoot and shod in
minimal sandals in Tarahumara and American subjects. The Tarahumara were barefoot and wore
Tarahumara sandals, while the Americans were barefoot and wore minimal sandals made to
simulate Tarahumara sandals. All subjects walked at self-determined speeds. They found that
4
both groups generated higher people forces more slowly with lower impulses when wearing
their respective sandals than when barefoot. They also determined the mechanical properties of
the two types of minimal sandals to differ, with Tarahumara sandals being stiffer. While
studying the forces of barefoot walking is the obvious next step for the Lieberman group, I am
not convinced this study is complete. This study includes some design flaws that need to be
considered seriously before it merits publication.
Major comments:
1. The same results are shown three times - in two tables and a graph. The authors should
be clear about which dataset is the (statistically) correct data set to present in their paper and
why. Rather than showing redundant tables and redundant tables and graphs, the authors
should show representative force traces (68% slower, 77% larger, 19% higher) along with the
graphs of overall data. A graph showing the force trace would be helpful, too.
2. The Americans recruited were age-matched to the Tarahumara, but are they also height-
and speed-matched. Are the differences between Americans and Tarahumara subjects explained
by differences in height/size, walking speed, or other variables (like physical fitness, daily
mileage, shoe size)? How do the variables measured (all of Tables 1 and 2) change with body size
or walking speed? It seems there are many possible confounding variables that were neither
considered nor discussed.
3. The different sandals are disconcerting. It seems the authors compared apples to
oranges. Why did the Tarahumara subjects not also wear the commercial sandals and the
Americans wear Tarahumaran sandals.
4. Table 1. Why are the number of steps analysed different from the number of subjects?
Was each step considered to be independent from every other step when a subject provides more
than one step in the analysis? If so, how do the statistics deal with this problem?
5. The discussion/interpretations do not seem to be different from the results. The abstract
states that their results “indicate that people tread more lightly when walking barefoot than in
minimal footwear.” But that statement is not an interpretation, it is simply what they results
show. What do these results indicate? Please discuss the findings.
6. The manuscript would benefit from a figure of the methods as well as a series of images
from the video files would also be helpful. A graph of the kinematics would also be helpful. How
do the impact peaks differ between those measured in the current study and those measured in
countless previous studies in “highly cushioned, supportive shoes”?
7. What is the hypothesis to be tested? What difference did you expect to see between the
two groups and why?
8. I find the conclusion that “not all minimal footwear is the same” to be problematic for
this paper and uninteresting. Essentially, they found that different shoes differ and that walking
with minimal footwear differs from walking barefoot. Why is the finding that “different shoes
differ” important?
9. The paper seems to imply that shoes are bad. Please explain why shoes are necessarily
bad, even though shoes didn’t exist for most of our evolution. I ask because there are lots of
technologies that extend our lifetime - is it possible that shoes with some cushion contribute to
lifelong health of our feet?
Minor comments
10. Page 9; Line 15: without shortening or lengthening their steps. How was this determined
quantitatively?
11. Page 10, line 35: what is Meff? Effective mass? Please explain what that means with
respect to this paper and why it’s relevant to this study. In fact, the authors should explain why
they made the measurements they did. They seem to expect the reader understand why these
specific measurements are relevant to their study.

12. Page 15; line 23. “individuals’ more dorsiflexed, and hence less compliant, ankles” - it’s
not clear how ankle compliance was measured/determined. Please explain.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Wallace et al. should be commended for making interesting measurements on Tarahumara
subjects as they walk barefoot and minimally shod. However, the comparison between the
Tarahumara and Americans when minimally shod is not well-controlled. The study has several
confounding factors. Their main finding is not new. The only new aspect of this paper is the
examination of walking in the Tarahumara, which in my opinion does not alone merit
publication as presented.
1. They find that shoes with different stiffnesses in different groups of men result in
different biomechanics. Again, the authors compare apples (Tarahumara sandals with a stiffer
sole) to oranges (American-made sandals with a more compliant sole) to demonstrate that the
people wearing different shoes walk with slightly different mechanics. This study should be re-
done to have the Americans walk in sandals with a stiffness similar to Tarahumara sandals. I do
not understand the point of a study that looks at different shoes worn by different groups.
2. Walking speed. The study needs to report the speeds walked by the individuals. What
does “controlling for speed” mean? How was this done? What speeds were chosen by the
subjects when unshod and shod? Please report the walking speeds used for both conditions by
both groups.
3. Page 18, top paragraph. I disagree with their claim that their ground reaction force
results cannot be compared to those already published because they collected their forces with
different equipment or with different sampling frequencies. If the quality of the data are so poor,
then their data should not be published. I believe strongly that it is the responsibility of current
research to compare their findings to previous research. If these comparisons cannot be made
(due to “technical reasons”), then what is the point of publishing these data? If these data cannot
be compared to an already published dataset because of the sampling frequency, then I would
11
argue these data are not “research quality” and not publishable. 100 Hz sampling frequency for
the force measurements should be plenty high to determine the accurate peak force and loading
rates during walking. 120 Hz for the kinematics is also plenty high for walking measurements.
Please explain more of the problems. Also, what are the “other technical reasons” (line 11) for not
comparing their data to already published similar data?
4. The authors ignore several studies examining walking when barefoot vs minimally shod
and only cite their refs 14 and 15. The difference between this study and the previous studies is
the specific shoe. The whole point of publishing data and allowing the world access is to compare
them to other data. I find it worrisome that these results seem to differ from the results published
by the same lab (Addison and Lieberman, 2015; peak forces and loading rates during barefoot
walking) - please explain.
5. The finding that people tread more lightly when wearing minimal sandals vs barefoot is
not new: Zhang et al., 2013, Shroyer et al., 2010, Shakoor et al., 2010 also show similar findings,
but not in these specific shoes and not in the Tarahumara.
6. Page 3. Line 44ff. “There has been surprisingly little research done … on unshod vs
minimally shod.” Although there hasn’t been much research done on these specific minimal
shoes, there has been a lot of research done on barefoot walking and some research done on
walking in flip flops and sandals, both of which would be considered minimal shoes. Franklin et
al wrote a nice review paper in 2015. I am surprised at how few of the previous similar studies
were cited in this study.
Minor comments:
Table 1. The standard for presenting units of force is “body weights” or “BW,” as previous
Lieberman papers have done.
Page 10. Meff. Please explain what effective mass is and why it’s relevant to this study.
Page 12. Line 35. Please be more specific than “different.”

Dear Dr Wallace,
Thank you for your submission to RSOS and for addressing the reviewers' concerns in your
response and resubmission.
One reviewer has made substantial criticism of your work, which although hawkish, I'm inclined
to support in my editorial recommendation. The fundamental issue is that of the comparison that
is being made and whether your conclusions are supported by the experimental setup. In
particular your second conclusion regarding "stiffer materials ... barefoot walking" (p19) is not
well supported - to do so would require the same people to wear a range of shoes - you have two
groups, each wearing different shoes, so you cannot readily compare the effect of shoe stiffness
on gait, especially because you show that the baseline condition (barefoot) is different between
the two groups. This is what the reviewer is getting at with their first "apples & oranges" point;
both groups of subjects would need to be tested with both kinds of shoes (and perhaps other
shoes as well), for you to be able to say much about material stiffness and impact forces.
With regard to data comparability, I suspect that this may come down to your choice of wording
"may not be directly comparable" (p18). I assume some degree of comparability and
generalisability is possible, otherwise the work is not very useful, as the reviewer is hinting.
Please tell us how we could generalise and compare your data to that already published.
Although the reviewer is concerned about novelty, RSOS does not select articles based on an
editorial assessment of impact, novelty or importance, and welcomes confirmatory and negative
findings. We do expect that the context is cited, and the reviewer provides a number of references
that should be included in the text.

Comments to the Author(s)
Wallace et al. should be commended for making interesting measurements on Tarahumara
subjects as they walk barefoot and minimally shod. However, the comparison between the
14
Tarahumara and Americans when minimally shod is not well-controlled. The study has several
confounding factors. Their main finding is not new. The only new aspect of this paper is the
examination of walking in the Tarahumara, which in my opinion does not alone merit
publication as presented.
1. They find that shoes with different stiffnesses in different groups of men result in
different biomechanics. Again, the authors compare apples (Tarahumara sandals with a stiffer
sole) to oranges (American-made sandals with a more compliant sole) to demonstrate that the
people wearing different shoes walk with slightly different mechanics. This study should be re-
done to have the Americans walk in sandals with a stiffness similar to Tarahumara sandals. I do
not understand the point of a study that looks at different shoes worn by different groups.
2. Walking speed. The study needs to report the speeds walked by the individuals. What
does “controlling for speed” mean? How was this done? What speeds were chosen by the
subjects when unshod and shod? Please report the walking speeds used for both conditions by
both groups.
3. Page 18, top paragraph. I disagree with their claim that their ground reaction force
results cannot be compared to those already published because they collected their forces with
different equipment or with different sampling frequencies. If the quality of the data are so poor,
then their data should not be published. I believe strongly that it is the responsibility of current
research to compare their findings to previous research. If these comparisons cannot be made
(due to “technical reasons”), then what is the point of publishing these data? If these data cannot
be compared to an already published dataset because of the sampling frequency, then I would
argue these data are not “research quality” and not publishable. 100 Hz sampling frequency for
the force measurements should be plenty high to determine the accurate peak force and loading
rates during walking. 120 Hz for the kinematics is also plenty high for walking measurements.
Please explain more of the problems. Also, what are the “other technical reasons” (line 11) for not
comparing their data to already published similar data?
4. The authors ignore several studies examining walking when barefoot vs minimally shod
and only cite their refs 14 and 15. The difference between this study and the previous studies is
the specific shoe. The whole point of publishing data and allowing the world access is to compare
them to other data. I find it worrisome that these results seem to differ from the results published
by the same lab (Addison and Lieberman, 2015; peak forces and loading rates during barefoot
walking) - please explain.
5. The finding that people tread more lightly when wearing minimal sandals vs barefoot is
not new: Zhang et al., 2013, Shroyer et al., 2010, Shakoor et al., 2010 also show similar findings,
but not in these specific shoes and not in the Tarahumara.
6. Page 3. Line 44ff. “There has been surprisingly little research done … on unshod vs
minimally shod.” Although there hasn’t been much research done on these specific minimal
shoes, there has been a lot of research done on barefoot walking and some research done on
walking in flip flops and sandals, both of which would be considered minimal shoes. Franklin et
al wrote a nice review paper in 2015. I am surprised at how few of the previous similar studies
were cited in this study.
Minor comments:

Lieberman papers have done.

Associate Editor's comments:
Two reviewers have provided a number of criticisms and suggestions for your work,
from providing power and absolute difference values, to rearranging tables and

all the reviewers' comments in your resubmission.
Response: We greatly appreciate the Associate Editor’s swift and attentive
consideration and processing of our manuscript.
Reviewer: 1
General comment
The paper analyzed the heel impact forces in two conditions (barefoot and
minimally shod – sandals) during walking among indigenous farmers - the
Tarahumara and urban Americans. It is a well-written paper, with proper
methodological design and deeper discussion. It is grounded on an original and
interesting subject that needs further consistent data to advance in the state of art.
The major topic investigated is a still controversy in the literature deserved to be
investigated. The population is definitely worth to be investigated due to its
uniqueness and a real native sandal-walking people. The paper will certainly add to
the field of Biomechanics of shoes and locomotion. There are only few comments
that I addressed to improve clarity in some descriptions throughout the manuscript.
Please, consider reviewing them.
Response: Many thanks to the reviewer for these comments.
Specific comments
Introduction
1. L. 23-47 page 6 - Avoid repetition – “habitually wear cushioned, supportive
shoes...” are mentioned twice in the same paragraph.
Response: We deleted the second mention.
2. Page 5 -6: I’d rather recommend posting your question/objective more clearly
instead of describing what you have analyzed or assessed.
Response: The style we adopt is to convey both the goal of our research and how it
was achieved in a single sentence. For example, we say “Here, to gain insight into
how humans generate impact peaks when walking barefoot versus in minimal
footwear, we analyse ground reaction forces and limb kinematic data collected from
two distinct populations.” This is generally considered an effective way of
establishing a strong and elegant connection between the motivation for a study and
the research itself (e.g., https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/scientific-
papers-13815490).
Methods
3. Page 7 - Please, consider adding sample size power calculation, at least a
posteriori calculus.
Response: After some deliberation, we decided not to include post hoc power
analyses for two reasons. First, although we certainly think that power calculations
are valuable when planning a study, using post hoc power analyses to interpret
results is usually considered to be inappropriate. As Hoenig and Heisey (2001 Am
Stat 55:19-24) explain in their well-known critique of post hoc power analyses:
“Power calculations tell us how well we might be able to characterize nature in the
future given a particular state and statistical study design, but they cannot use
information in the data to tell us about the likely states of nature.” A particularly
important point made by Hoenig and Heisey is that power estimates from collected
data are misleading because the observed power is a one-to-one function of the p-
value obtained. Second, regardless of whether post hoc power analyses are
theoretically sound, there currently is no simple, established method for conducting
such an analysis for a general linear mixed model. It would require a power
simulation based on simulated datasets (usually 10,000), which is beyond the scope
of our study. That said, if any reader wants to conduct a power simulation based on
our results , our paper provides all the necessary information including effect size
estimates, sample sizes, and the number of covariates.
4. Page 7 - The sample was not age-matched. To match a sample by age or body
mass or any other variable, you should recruit one subject from the second group
with the same anthropometric/demographic characteristic to the other that has just
been recruited from the first group. And this was not the case. And it is reflected in
the age confident interval differences between groups, as well as the time difference
in the recruitment.
Response: It is true that Tarahumara and American participants were not matched
by age in precisely the way described by the reviewer. Thus, in order to avoid
confusion, we have deleted the phrase “age-matched” from the Methods section.
However, when designing the study, the possibility that age might be a confounding
factor was considered. We collected data in two phases, first among the
Tarahumara, and then among the Americans. Initial analyses of the Tarahumara
data indicated to us that impact force parameters were not significantly associated
with an individual’s age. Specifically, in a general linear mixed model that included
footwear (barefoot versus sandals), age, and walking speed as fixed effects, and
participant identity as a random effect, we found no significant association between
age and impact force magnitude (p=0.22), rate (p=0.48), or impulse (p=0.32). For
this reason, when we recruited the American participants, we did not consider it
necessary to individually match according to age (in the way described by the
reviewer). Nevertheless, to be extra cautious, we restricted the American group to
individuals whose age range matched closely the Tarahumara range. Ultimately, as
we report in the Methods section of our paper, the Tarahumara ranged in age
between 41 and 75 years, and the Americans were between 40 and 77 years of age,
which are very similar age ranges. Thus, age was unlikely to have been a
confounding factor in our study.
In contrast to age, however, body mass has been shown by numerous prior studies
(including many from our laboratory) to be a very strong predictor of impact force
parameters. Recognizing this, to account for interindividual variation in body mass,
we followed the standard strategy in biomechanical research of normalizing impact
force parameters by body mass. In the revised manuscript, to make it clearer that
the strategy we adopted is well established, we added a key citation that provides
empirical justification for this method of dealing with body mass effects in studies of
impact forces (i.e., Wannop et al. 2012 J Appl Biomech 28, 665-676).
5. Page 8 – 1st paragraph – Please add more information on the Pressure
measurement protocol: number of trials, steps prior to plate contact, steps post
plate contact, time of habituation to the platform and to the new sandals wore by
the Americans, rest, platform leveling, among others.
Response: This is a good suggestion. Several additional details were added to the
methods section about our experimental protocol, including the number of trials
conducted per participant, the criteria used for excluding trials, the number of steps
taken before and after platform contact (along with two new relevant references),
the height of the platform, rest, instructions given to the participants, time of
habituation to the minimal sandals worn by the Americans, and the amount of
habituation required by the participants in order to successfully complete the trials.
6. Page 9 – “Values were transformed into units of body mass...” – values were
normalized to body mass.
Response: We changed the wording.
Results
7. Please report the Effect size or Mean Difference considering it is a quantitative
measure of the strength of a phenomenon. Sometime, only showing the statistical
significance (p-value) does not always point to a clinically relevant difference.
Although the p-value can be a useful statistical measure, it is commonly misused and
misinterpreted (Wasserstein and Lazar, 2016). Instead of using % statistics, the use
of effect size is an alternative way to look at the results, sometimes even more
important than p- values or %, because it shows a clinical and meaningful
difference. Whereas statistical tests of significance tell us the likelihood that result
differ from chance expectations, effect-size measurements tell us the relative
magnitude of the mean differences (Browner, 2006; Thalheimer and Cook, 2002).
For example: what does 2% of more dorsiflexed ankles mean? Even if it was a
significant difference between shoe conditions, what is the real meaning of such a
small difference? For instance: “ankle plantarflexion was 7-8% greater”. What does
this difference mean in relevance? Or: page 13 – “...differed little between
Tarahumara and Americans...”
Response: This is a great point. To address this issue, we have added a new table
(table 2 in the revised manuscript) reporting least squares mean differences ±
standard error of differences, as well as 95% confidence intervals for the least
squares mean differences. Also, please see our response to the reviewer’s next
comment (#8) regarding our discussion of statistically significant differences
associated with effect sizes that are unlikely to be biomechanically meaningful.
Discussion
8. About the issue raised in the results section, the affirmative sentence in the
discussion (1st paragraph, page 14) need to be reconsidered in the light of the effect
size. When attesting that “In both populations, the effects of minimal footwear on
impact peaks were due, at least in part, to the combination of individuals’ more
dorsiflexed, and hence less compliant, ankles during the time of impact and to
greater effective mass than in barefoot walking”, you are strongly relying on a result
with very small power. I would recommend you to be more cautious due to the
meaningless difference of 2% of ankle flexion.
Response: This is a good point. We agree that observed differences in effective mass
between barefoot and minimally shod walking are likely more biomechanically
meaningful than the very small (yet statistically significant) differences in foot
dorsiflexion. Therefore, we deleted the mentions of ankle dorsiflexion and
compliance in the Abstract, and we substantially changed the text of the Discussion
to reflect this more cautious interpretation of the results.
9. I would recommend to improve the discussion about the stiffness of the shoe and
its influence on kinetic measures and how it did influence your measures – last
statement in the paper (summary). Please, you might find interesting the paper:
Onodera et al. PeerJ, v. 5, p. e3026, 2017.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer drawing our attention to the new paper by
Onodera and colleagues. The findings are indeed interesting but not truly relevant
to our study since Onodera et al. focused on how sole material properties affect
impact forces during running but not walking, and the material property
investigated was resilience, which we did not measure.
Reviewer: 2
General comment
Wallace and others examined the kinetics and kinematics of walking barefoot and
shod in minimal sandals in Tarahumara and American subjects. The Tarahumara
were barefoot and wore Tarahumara sandals, while the Americans were barefoot
and wore minimal sandals made to simulate Tarahumara sandals. All subjects
walked at self-determined speeds. They found that both groups generated higher
people forces more slowly with lower impulses when wearing their respective
sandals than when barefoot. They also determined the mechanical properties of the
two types of minimal sandals to differ, with Tarahumara sandals being stiffer. While
studying the forces of barefoot walking is the obvious next step for the Lieberman
group, I am not convinced this study is complete. This study includes some design
flaws that need to be considered seriously before it merits publication.
Response: Thanks for these thoughtful and constructive comments. We hope that
our responses will resolve any concerns.
Specific comments
Major comments:
1. The same results are shown three times - in two tables and a graph. The authors
should be clear about which dataset is the (statistically) correct data set to present
in their paper and why. Rather than showing redundant tables and redundant tables
and graphs, the authors should show representative force traces (68% slower, 77%
larger, 19% higher) along with the graphs of overall data. A graph showing the force
trace would be helpful, too.
Response: These are helpful suggestions. We made several changes to address these
points. First, we deleted table 1. The only critical data in that table were the
descriptive statistics for walking speed, which we have moved to the methods
section, and the information on the number of steps analysed, which we moved to
table 2 (i.e., table 1 in the revised manuscript). Second, we deleted figure 3 since all
of the information it contained is reported in a table. Third, we have added a new
figure (figure 4 in the revised manuscript) illustrating representative force traces.
2. The Americans recruited were age-matched to the Tarahumara, but are they also
height- and speed-matched. Are the differences between Americans and
Tarahumara subjects explained by differences in height/size, walking speed, or
other variables (like physical fitness, daily mileage, shoe size)? How do the variables
measured (all of Tables 1 and 2) change with body size or walking speed? It seems
there are many possible confounding variables that were neither considered nor
discussed.
Response: Walking speed and body mass are the two factors most likely to confound
studies of impact forces, and we believe that we have rigorously and sufficiently
controlled for these factors in our statistical analyses. Speed was included as a
covariate in all of our statistical models, and statistically significant associations
between speed and biomechanical parameters are reported in table 1 (the former
table 2). Moreover, as we explain above in response to Reviewer #1’s comment #4,
all kinetic data were transformed into units of body mass in order to enable
comparisons between individuals.
Height was not included as a covariate in our statistical analyses given ample
evidence from prior studies that individuals of varying stature use similar walking
(inverted pendulum) mechanics at voluntary speeds (e.g., Cavagna et al. 1983 J
Physiol 343:323-339). Thus, although stature affects an individual’s preferred
walking speed, height is not expected to independently influence body-mass
adjusted impact forces. Had we asked all participants to walk at the exact same
speed, then height would indeed have likely been a confounding factor since shorter
and taller people would presumably have had to adopt slightly different walking
mechanics to achieve that specific speed (e.g., Moretto et al. 2007 Gait Posture
25:40-48). But at freely chosen walking speeds, dynamically similar mechanics can
be assumed among individuals of varying height (e.g., Alexander and Jayes 1983 J
Zool Lond 201:135-152). Just as a check on this, we calculated Froude numbers for
steps included in the study and found that both American and Tarahumara
participants walked with average Froude numbers of 0.12.
Regarding other factors not included in our models, we are not aware of any
research suggesting that physical fitness, daily mileage, or shoe size has an
independent effect on any of the biomechanical parameters considered in our study.
3. The different sandals are disconcerting. It seems the authors compared apples to
oranges. Why did the Tarahumara subjects not also wear the commercial sandals
and the Americans wear Tarahumaran sandals.
Response: The primary goal of our paper, as suggested by the title and the first
sentence of the Abstract, and explicitly stated in the Introduction is as follows: “To
gain insight into how humans generate impact peaks when walking barefoot versus
in minimal footwear, we analyse ground reaction forces and limb kinematic data
collected from two distinct populations.” In other words, our primarily goal was to
investigate impact forces during barefoot versus minimally shod walking, and we
thus looked at two different populations. And for each population, participants were
measured while wearing a type of minimal sandal available to them (i.e., culturally
available in the case of the Tarahumara, and commercially available for the
Americans). Most Tarahumara are not accustomed to walking in soft-soled sandals,
and Americans cannot buy nor use traditional Tarahumara sandals.
We do agree with the reviewer that our effort to achieve a secondary goal of our
paper, namely, to assess the degree to which variation in sole stiffness affects impact
peaks, would ideally control for potential group differences in walking biomechanics
by having each participant wear both type of sandals. We did not do this because we
do not think Tarahumara and Americans would walk normally using each other’s
sandal types. Also, major group differences in walking biomechanics while shod
seem very unlikely in light of the close similarity in the barefoot walking
biomechanics of the two groups. Nevertheless, to address this comment, we have
added an acknowledgement of this issue to the paragraph in the Discussion on study
limitations.
4. Table 1. Why are the number of steps analysed different from the number of
subjects? Was each step considered to be independent from every other step when a
subject provides more than one step in the analysis? If so, how do the statistics deal
with this problem?
Response: To manage this issue, participant identity was included as a random
effect in all of the general linear mixed models, which we explain in the Methods
section.
5. The discussion/interpretations do not seem to be different from the results. The
abstract states that their results “indicate that people tread more lightly when
walking barefoot than in minimal footwear.” But that statement is not an
interpretation, it is simply what they results show. What do these results indicate?
Please discuss the findings.
Response: Although scientific knowledge of barefoot and minimally shod walking
and running is limited, many people have passionate opinions on the topic, with
some people arguing that supportive shoes are unhealthy and others arguing that
supportive shoes improve health. Because of these passionate and often
scientifically unfounded disagreements, we believe that the scientific data that do
exist must be interpreted very cautiously in order to not give the false impression of
providing empirical support for an extreme view at one end of the spectrum, and to
not unnecessarily anger advocates of an extreme view at the other end of the
spectrum. We therefore tried to be very prudent in our interpretation of our results,
and we think that our discussion of the findings adequately raises all of the most
important implications without diving too deep into topics such as health that our
research did not directly address.
6. The manuscript would benefit from a figure of the methods as well as a series of
images from the video files would also be helpful. A graph of the kinematics would
also be helpful. How do the impact peaks differ between those measured in the
current study and those measured in countless previous studies in “highly
cushioned, supportive shoes”?
Response: We added a representative video of an experimental trial to the
electronic supplementary material. In terms of how our data compare to those
reported in previous studies, unfortunately, as we acknowledge in the Discussion,
because impact forces were measured using a pedography platform with a lower
sampling frequency than the force plate sensors commonly used in laboratories to
measure ground reaction forces, and the video camera we used to measure impact
velocity had a maximum recording rate that was lower than the rates typically used
in laboratories, our data are potentially not directly comparable to previously
published data. Also, our data are not directly comparable to published data since
participants walked at speeds that were self-selected and differed from the fixed
treadmill speeds used in all relevant prior laboratory-based research. However,
these technical issues in no way undermine our comparisons between barefoot and
minimally shod walking, or between the Tarahumara and Americans.
7. What is the hypothesis to be tested? What difference did you expect to see
between the two groups and why?
Response: Please see our response to Reviewer 1’s comment #2.
8. I find the conclusion that “not all minimal footwear is the same” to be problematic
for this paper and uninteresting. Essentially, they found that different shoes differ
and that walking with minimal footwear differs from walking barefoot. Why is the
finding that “different shoes differ” important?
Response: In response to this comment, we added to both the Introduction (last
paragraph) and Discussion (third paragraph) explanations for why we think this is
an important issue and insight.
9. The paper seems to imply that shoes are bad. Please explain why shoes are
necessarily bad, even though shoes didn’t exist for most of our evolution. I ask
because there are lots of technologies that extend our lifetime - is it possible that
shoes with some cushion contribute to lifelong health of our feet?
Response: We do not believe that shoes are bad, nor do we make such a claim
anywhere in our paper. What we state is that various shoes potentially have both
benefits and costs and that they affect gait. As we are very careful to mention at
multiple points in the paper (Abstract, Introduction and Discussion), the hypothesis
that shoes involve trade-offs between protection against kinematic and kinetic
effects has not been fully explored and merits further consideration.
Minor comments:
10. Page 9; Line 15: without shortening or lengthening their steps. How was this
determined quantitatively?
Response: Several additional details were added to the methods section that we
believe clarify this issue. Please see our response to Reviewer 1’s comment #5.
11. Page 10, line 35: what is Meff? Effective mass? Please explain what that means
with respect to this paper and why it’s relevant to this study. In fact, the authors
should explain why they made the measurements they did. They seem to expect the
reader understand why these specific measurements are relevant to their study.
Response: Meff is indeed effective mass. To avoid confusion, we replaced “Meff” with
“effective mass” throughout the paper except in the equation provided in the
methods section. The relationship between impact peaks and effective mass is
explained in the Introduction. In terms of why we focused on the impact peak
variables that we did, as we state in the paper “Analyses of ground reaction force
data focused on multiple aspects of impact peaks (magnitude, loading rate and
vertical impulse) generated at the moment of heel strike, which have been
hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of certain lower extremity
musculoskeletal disorders.”
12. Page 15; line 23. “individuals’ more dorsiflexed, and hence less compliant,
ankles” - it’s not clear how ankle compliance was measured/determined. Please
explain.
Response: Please see our response to Reviewer 1’s comment #8.
Appendix B
Detailed responses to reviewer comments
Associate Editor comments:
1. The fundamental issue is that of the comparison that is being made and whether
your conclusions are supported by the experimental setup. In particular your
second conclusion regarding "stiffer materials ... barefoot walking" (p19) is not well
supported - to do so would require the same people to wear a range of shoes - you
have two groups, each wearing different shoes, so you cannot readily compare the
effect of shoe stiffness on gait, especially because you show that the baseline
condition (barefoot) is different between the two groups. This is what the reviewer
is getting at with their first "apples & oranges" point; both groups of subjects would
need to be tested with both kinds of shoes (and perhaps other shoes as well), for
you to be able to say much about material stiffness and impact forces.
Response: After further consideration, we agree that our experimental design is not
adequate for rigorously investigating the effects of sole cushioning on impact peaks.
To figure out how best to deal with this issue, we reached out to the Associate Editor
by email, and we received the following helpful suggestion: “In my view you have
two options to get this manuscript published: (1) remove the conclusion about
material properties and impact force modulation, or (2) acquire some appropriate
sets of footwear and a cohort of volunteers and repeat your experiments to test the
hypothesis that sole material properties relate to footfall dynamics, i.e. to provide
experimental support for this conclusion.” Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to
collect additional data from the participants in this study, which was carried out in a
remote area of Mexico. Thus, we have gone with the first option of eliminating most
of our discussion of cushioning effects on impact peaks, and what discussion of this
issue remains in the text has been dramatically altered to be much more cautious.
We made a number of specific changes to the manuscript to address this issue,
which we detail below in our response to the reviewer’s first comment.
Also, although the reviewer’s and Associate Editor’s concerns were primarily with
how we discuss the comparisons of impact peaks during shod walking in the
Tarahumara and Americans, we also made some minor but important changes to
how we discuss comparisons of barefoot impact peaks between the two groups.
While impact peaks during barefoot walking were not different between the two
groups in terms of statistical significance, we agree with the point made by the
Associate Editor that data are nevertheless not identical between groups. Changes
were made to the text to acknowledge this. For example, in the results section, we
now say: “Average impact peaks associated with barefoot walking also differed to
some extent between populations, but not significantly so.”
In addition, we would like to respond to a comment about Figure 3 made by the
Associate Editor in their helpful email mentioned above: “I do note that Table 1 sets
out values for peak forces and rates, but these appear not to relate directly to the
'representative' traces you illustrate.” We do not particularly like graphs that depict
‘representative’ data instead of raw data or statistical summaries, but we added this
figure after it was requested by a reviewer of the first version of our manuscript. To
construct this figure, we went to the raw data and identified four traces that most
closely matched the mean values in table 1, which seemed to be a reasonable way of
identifying a ‘representative’ trace. However, the Associate Editor is correct that
these traces are not a perfect or identical illustration of the least squares mean
values reported in table 1 (though they are very similar). Thus, in order to more
accurately describe the relationship between table 1 and figure 3, we changed the
figure caption to the following: “Ground reaction forces produced at the beginning
of stance phase by Tarahumara and Americans walking barefoot and in minimal
sandals. Impact peak values approximate the least squares means reported in table
1.” If the Associate Editor does not consider this to be a sufficient clarification, then
we would be happy to exclude the figure entirely. Unfortunately, given the way that
data were collected, with walking speed uncontrolled, it would be computationally
infeasible to calculate and depict real least squares means (or confidence intervals)
values over the course of the entire impact phase of the gait cycle.
2. With regard to data comparability, I suspect that this may come down to your
choice of wording "may not be directly comparable" (p18). I assume some degree of
comparability and generalisability is possible, otherwise the work is not very useful,
as the reviewer is hinting. Please tell us how we could generalise and compare your
data to that already published.
Response: The reviewer’s comments 3-6 all, to some degree, express a general
concern that we do not adequately contextualize our work within prior research.
We agree with the Associate Editor that this concern is probably largely due to poor
wording in our earlier manuscript, which we regret. As we describe below in our
responses to the reviewer’s comments 3-6, we have made a number of changes and
additions to the text that we believe solve this problem.
Reviewer comments:
1. They find that shoes with different stiffnesses in different groups of men result in
different biomechanics. Again, the authors compare apples (Tarahumara sandals
with a stiffer sole) to oranges (American-made sandals with a more compliant sole)
to demonstrate that the people wearing different shoes walk with slightly different
mechanics. This study should be re-done to have the Americans walk in sandals with
a stiffness similar to Tarahumara sandals. I do not understand the point of a study
that looks at different shoes worn by different groups.
Response: The goal of our paper, as suggested by the title and the first sentence of
the abstract, and explicitly stated in the introduction is as follows: ‘To gain insight
into how humans generate impact peaks when walking barefoot versus in minimal
footwear, we analyse ground reaction forces and limb kinematic data collected from
two distinct populations.” That is, our goal was to investigate impact forces during
barefoot versus minimally shod walking, and we accomplished this by looking at the
issue in two different populations. By addressing the same question in two different
populations, we are essentially performing a quasi-replication experiment that adds
credibility to the generalizability of our results.
In order to make it clearer at the paper’s onset that our only goal is to address the
same question independently in two different populations, we made several
changes to the wording of the introduction.
First, we deleted the following suggestion in the prior version of paper of any sort of
secondary goal of the study: “Also, comparing minimally shod walking among the
Tarahumara and Americans permitted us to explore the effects of differences in the
stiffness of materials used for soles on impact peaks, which is a critical feature of
minimal footwear design that has been hypothesized to influence musculoskeletal
pathology risk.”
Second, we added the following sentence: “In order to assess if the findings from the
Tarahumara are consistent with those obtained from a population that is not
habitually minimally shod, we also measured walking kinetics and kinematics in a
group of urban Americans while barefoot and in a commercially available brand of
minimal sandals…”
Third, we added a final paragraph to the introduction that explicitly states the
hypotheses tested in our study: “Together, data from the Tarahumara and
Americans were used to test two hypotheses independently in two discrete
populations. First, in both groups we tested the hypothesis that aspects of impact
peaks (magnitude, loading rate and vertical impulse) generated at the moment of
heel strike are similar during barefoot and minimally shod walking. Second, we
tested the hypothesis that factors known to influence impact peaks (effective mass,
impact velocity and lower limb joint flexion) are also comparable between footwear
conditions within each population.”
In addition, we made the following changes to other sections of the paper to exercise
more prudence in our handling of the fact that the sandals worn by the two groups
were different.
First, in the abstract, we deleted all statements about comparisons between the
Tarahumara and Americans. In other words, the abstract now only discusses
comparisons between footwear conditions within each population.
Second, we changed the methods section to better explain why we measured sole
stiffness in the first place: “Although the first hypothesis we test predicts that impact
forces are similar during barefoot and minimally shod walking, if this hypothesis is
falsified and we find that impact peaks are significantly affected by footwear, then
such effects might be expected to vary between the Tarahumara and Americans
since the soles of their sandals are made of different materials. Specifically, holding
all other variables constant, the effective mass of the lower extremity that exchanges
momentum with the ground during impact should decelerate to zero over a longer
period of time in whichever type of sandal has a less stiff sole, thus generating a
larger vertical impulse [15]. To measure the difference…”
Third, we dramatically altered the discussion paragraph on differences in impact
peaks between groups: “Although the effects of minimal footwear on walking
kinetics and kinematics were generally very similar between Tarahumara and
American participants, impact peaks generated by walking in the traditional versus
commercial sandals worn by the two populations, respectively, were nevertheless
distinct. Specifically, while impact peaks produced by barefoot walking did not
significantly differ between groups, Tarahumara walking in traditional sandals
generated impact peaks with significantly higher rates of loading and with smaller
impulses than Americans wearing commercial sandals. As discussed above, such
differences between Tarahumara and American impact peaks during shod walking
might be due to variation in the stiffness of the soles of the different sandals worn
by the two groups. Mechanical testing revealed that Tarahumara sandal soles are
=2.4-fold stiffer than those of the Americans’ sandals, and controlled laboratory
experiments have shown that while stiffer soles have little effect on the magnitude
of loading [15,29,30], they increase the rate of collision between the foot and
ground, inevitably decreasing the impulse [15]. Nevertheless, since all participants
were measured walking only in a single type of minimal footwear, it is possible that
differences between impact peaks produced by minimally shod Tarahumara and
Americans were partly due to group differences in walking biomechanics rather
than just variation in sandal sole stiffness. Individuals were not measured wearing
both types of sandals since most Americans are unlikely to buy sandals made of car
tire treads, and the Tarahumara do not have access to sandals made from EVA.
Ultimately, our goal was not to test whether both populations would respond
identically to the same sandals, but instead to examine if the effects of wearing
minimal sandals on impact peaks are generally similar across discrete populations,
which appears to be the case. Future work is required to more rigorously study the
consequences of variation in sole stiffness for impact forces across minimal
footwear designs, both commercial types and those maintained by indigenous
cultural traditions.”
Fourth, we also changed our statement about this issue in the final paragraph of the
paper to be more cautious: “The results also raise the possibility that the material of
the sole of different types of minimal footwear may be an important influence on
how impact forces are modulated, with stiffer materials resulting in higher impact
loading rates and lower impulses of loading. This hypothesis, which requires further
testing,…”
2. Walking speed. The study needs to report the speeds walked by the individuals.
What does “controlling for speed” mean? How was this done? What speeds were
chosen by the subjects when unshod and shod? Please report the walking speeds
used for both conditions by both groups.
Response: In the methods section, we have added average voluntary walking
speeds for both footwear conditions in each population. The effects of variation in
voluntary walking speed on impact peaks and joint kinematics were controlled for
by including speed as a covariate in all of our statistical models. To further clarify
this, at multiple places in the results section, the phrase “controlling for speed” has
been changed to “controlling statistically for variation in speed.”
3. Page 18, top paragraph. I disagree with their claim that their ground reaction
force results cannot be compared to those already published because they collected
their forces with different equipment or with different sampling frequencies. If the
quality of the data are so poor, then their data should not be published. I believe
strongly that it is the responsibility of current research to compare their findings to
previous research. If these comparisons cannot be made (due to “technical
reasons”), then what is the point of publishing these data? If these data cannot be
compared to an already published dataset because of the sampling frequency, then I
would argue these data are not “research quality” and not publishable. 100 Hz
sampling frequency for the force measurements should be plenty high to determine
the accurate peak force and loading rates during walking. 120 Hz for the kinematics
is also plenty high for walking measurements. Please explain more of the problems.
Also, what are the “other technical reasons” (line 11) for not comparing their data to
already published similar data?
Response: We regret that we were not clear in our original wording. We agree with
the reviewer that 100 Hz is an adequate sampling frequency for force
measurements, and video recording at 120 Hz is sufficient for collecting kinematic
data, or else we would not have gone through the effort of collecting the data that
we did. The point that we were trying to make was not that our data are not at all
comparable to data collected with more sophisticated equipment available in many
gait labs. Instead, we were simply acknowledging that our measurements were
made using equipment that is the best available for fieldwork but not standard in
many lab-based studies, so some caution is necessary when making direct
comparisons of data. Most importantly, what we failed to state explicitly in the
earlier version of our paper, and what we were alluding to by “other technical
reasons,” is that lab-based studies almost always use fixed walking speeds rather
than variable voluntary speeds like we did. Since ground reaction forces are
strongly influenced by speed, data from these two types of experimental setups are
not likely to be directly comparable unless speeds are the same. To clarify this, we
have rephrased that section of the paragraph on limitations to the following:
“Second, we measured impact peak forces using a pedography platform with a lower
sampling frequency than the force plate sensors typically used to measure ground
reaction forces in laboratory-based research, and the video camera we used to
measure impact velocity had a maximum recording rate that was lower than the
rates used in prior studies [13-15]. For these technical reasons, as well as the fact
that participants in this study walked at self-selected speeds rather than a fixed
speed, directly comparing our kinetic and kinematic data to laboratory-derived data
on human walking requires some caution. Nevertheless, our comparisons between
barefoot and minimally shod walking should be unbiased by these issues.”
4. The authors ignore several studies examining walking when barefoot vs
minimally shod and only cite their refs 14 and 15. The difference between this study
and the previous studies is the specific shoe. The whole point of publishing data and
allowing the world access is to compare them to other data. I find it worrisome that
these results seem to differ from the results published by the same lab (Addison and
Lieberman, 2015; peak forces and loading rates during barefoot walking) - please
explain.
Response: It is not the case that there are “several [previous] studies examining
walking when barefoot vs minimally shod” that report data on impact peaks. To our
knowledge, ours is the first study to report impact peak forces from people walking
barefoot and minimally shod. References 14 and 15 do not report such data, nor do
any of the other papers that the reviewer mentions in subsequent comments (see
below). We do not understand the reviewer’s worry about the accordance between
the results of this study and those of Addison and Lieberman, as Addison and
Lieberman did not measure or report any data from barefoot walking.
As far as we know, only two previous studies have reported data on impact peaks
from barefoot versus shod walking, both of which we cite, and neither of which
involved any type of shoe that could be considered minimal. Cavanagh et al. (1981)
reported data from 10 people walking barefoot, in army boots, leather soled dress
shoes, and crepe soled casual shoes. Lafortune and Hennig reported data from 5
people walking barefoot, in leather soled dress shoes, and cushioned athletic shoes.
Interestingly, both of these studies found that impact peak magnitudes were higher
during barefoot walking than shod walking, which is the exact opposite of what we
found, both in the Tarahumara and Americans, using a sample that is more than four
times larger than the two previous studies combined.
Thus, we do not believe that we have ignored any relevant prior research. However,
in light of the reviewer’s comment, we have made a greater effort to discuss the
studies of Cavanagh et al. and Lafortune and Hennig since they are the only two
previous studies to report data on impact peaks during unshod and shod walking,
even though they do not examine the effects of minimal shoes. Specifically, to the
introduction, we have added the following sentence: “…two prior studies based on
small sample sizes suggested that people generate impact peaks with significantly
higher magnitudes when walking barefoot than in cushioned, supportive shoes
[29,30]. However, little is currently known about how impact peaks are produced by
people walking in minimal footwear.” Also, in the discussion we have added the
following sentence: “…which, similar to our findings, contradicts earlier research
suggesting that shoes attenuate ground reaction forces during walking [29,30].”
5. The finding that people tread more lightly when wearing minimal sandals vs
barefoot is not new: Zhang et al., 2013, Shroyer et al., 2010, Shakoor et al., 2010 also
show similar findings, but not in these specific shoes and not in the Tarahumara.
Response: To be clear, we are not arguing “people tread more lightly when wearing
minimal sandals vs barefoot.” We are arguing the opposite. We are aware of the
papers that the reviewer mentions but chose not to cite them in the earlier draft of
our paper because we did not consider them directly relevant to our study as none
of them report data on impact peaks. Instead, these papers report data on maximum
ground reaction forces throughout the entire step cycle, which occur later in the
step cycle than impact peaks and are driven by body weight rather than collisional
forces produced by heel striking. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that the
findings of these studies are relevant to the general idea that people tread more
lightly when barefoot. Thus, we have added these papers to the bibliography and the
following statement to the discussion: “Together, these results show that, regardless
of individuals’ habituation to minimal footwear or the exact type of minimal
footwear worn, people generally tend to tread more lightly when walking barefoot
than even in very minimal sandals. Consistent with this idea, recent studies [40-43]
have reported that maximum external force magnitudes across the entire step cycle
are also lower when people walk barefoot than shod, including in minimal footwear
such as flip-flops, which, similar to our findings, contradicts earlier research
suggesting that shoes attenuate ground reaction forces during walking [29,30].”
6. Page 3. Line 44ff. “There has been surprisingly little research done ... on unshod vs
minimally shod.” Although there hasn’t been much research done on these specific
minimal shoes, there has been a lot of research done on barefoot walking and some
research done on walking in flip flops and sandals, both of which would be
considered minimal shoes. Franklin et al wrote a nice review paper in 2015. I am
surprised at how few of the previous similar studies were cited in this study.
Response: Please see our response to the reviewer’s fourth comment. We chose not
to cite the Franklin et al. review because it does not discuss differences between
impact peaks generated by barefoot and minimally shod walking, which is the focus
of our study.
7. Table 1. The standard for presenting units of force is “body weights” or “BW,” as
previous Lieberman papers have done.
Response: We changed the units from body mass to body weight.
8. Page 10. Meff. Please explain what effective mass is and why it’s relevant to this
study.
Response: The relationship between impact peaks and effective mass is explained
in both the Introduction and Methods.
9. Page 12. Line 35. Please be more specific than “different.”
Response: The three subsequent sentences in that paragraph thoroughly specify
how impact peaks are different between barefoot and shod walking in the
Tarahumara.
10. Page 12. Line 45. What does “after controlling for speed” mean?
Response: Please see our response to the reviewer’s second comment.
