This paper describes the results of a screen using a library of off-patent drugs for beta cell
maturation. Min6 cells transduced with a dual Ins1-eGPF and Pdx1-RFP reporter is used. Using
this approach, the sodium channel blocker carbamazepine is identified as capable of increasing
insulin content. In general, the work is logically laid out and well described and written.
This group previously used a similar approach, but have now added a nice improvement to their
strategy by adding a nuclear localization signal to both reporters. The basic premise for the screen
is that Ins1 expression follows that of Pdx1 and an increase in the ratio of Ins1- over Pdx1-driven
reporter expression is interpreted as an increase in beta cell maturation. This approach raises two
technical questions:
1) The Ins1 promoter fragment that is used is only 400 bp, which means that there is little space
between the Pdx1 promoter driving RFP and the ORF of eGFP. How do the investigators ensure
that the Pdx1 promoter in their lentiviral reporter construct is transcriptionally isolated and does
not contribute to the expression of eGFP independent of eGFP.
2) FACS plots should be included of the sort at the basis of Figure 1b, preferably with an
explanation of the full gating strategy. One would expect populations of RFP single positive cells
and GFP/RFP double positive cells with, but the FACS data will reveal the relative sizes of these
populations, whether they resolve in discrete populations, and if so, whether the mean intensities
in each population shift with increased maturity.
Is a holding potential of -120 mV necessary to measure the effects of Carb on islet cells (Fig. 6C) or
does Carb measurably impact sodium currents at a more physiologically relevant resting
potential? If not, the positive actions of this drug may indeed not be dependent on Nav1.7.
The conclusion that Na+ channels are required for insulin production in the title and elsewhere is
a bit strongly worded. I agree that the modest increases in Ins1 reporter activity and Ins1
transcript and Scn9a-/- islets could all be explained by increased insulin production. However,
other explanations cannot be ruled out and the conclusion of increased insulin production
requires direct demonstration of increased insulin protein biosynthesis. It appears that the
increased content in Scn9a-/- islets can equally well be explained by increased accumulation of
insulin over time owing to the reduced glucose-stimulated insulin release in these islets, which
were isolated from mice at the relatively advanced age of 1 year. One would predict that other
beta cell hormones such as amylin would equally accumulate over time if the underlying
mechanism for this result is a partial exocytosis defect. Ultra-structural studies would be
informative to compare the density of secretory granules in control and Scn9a-/- beta cells.

The manuscript reports the results of screening a library of small molecules that will increase
insulin and pdx1 gene expression in beta cells. A novel reporter construct is used for these assays
conducted in MIN6 beta cells. The studies are appropriately conducted with state of the art
methods and the results are presented clearly and interpreted adequately incl use of appropriate
statistical tools. A lead molecule (carbamazepine) and a molecular target (Scn9a) are identified.
The studies are in agreement with previous findings from this group and represent an
incremental advance. Scn9a ko mice were tested for insulin content (increased) and insulin
secretion (reference 24). The in vivo results in the ko mice are consistent with the in vitro findings.
To complete the interpretation, reasoning and conclusion the manusript lacks following data:
Insulin and PDX1 protein content after carbamazepin treatment may should be examined in
isolated islets of mice that are kept on standard diet as well as mice which have reduced PDX1
expression (and insulin content) after exposure to a diabetogenic diet.
Including in vivo glucose tolerance may also be informative in mice on SD and HFD treated with
carbamazepin.

The paper from Szabat et al. described a live-cell imaging tool with eGFP and mRFP driven by
the Pdx1 and Ins1 promoters, respectively, which could be of relevance for the study of the
mechanisms of ß-cell maturation and insulin production. Given that both ß-cell
dedifferentiation and reduced insulin production have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
type 2 diabetes, such a tool may allow the identification of novel molecules with therapeutic
potential. Thanks to the addition of nuclear localization signals, the authors significantly
improved their previously published imaging tool, allowing more automated analysis of drug
screening. By transfecting the MIN6 insulinoma cell line with their fluorescent reporter, the
authors have screened more than a thousand off-patent drugs with well-known mechanisms and
found a role for the Na+ channel inhibitor carbamazepine in insulin production.
To strengthen their results, the authors used a combination of analytical and manual techniques
in examining the “hits” of the screening for further testing. Moreover, they conducted follow-up
validation studies to confirm the beneficial effects of the selected drugs on insulin production by
using qPCR. Finally they confirmed the role of Na+ channels in insulin production by using in
vivo data from a Na+ channel knock out mouse, which showed accordingly a significant increase
in insulin production compared to wild-type controls.
Although the tools are solid and their applications may go beyond drug screening, I have a
couple of concerns and some minor issues that in my opinion need to be addressed before
publication.
Major issues
My main concern is the choice of MIN6 for this high-content screen. The authors state that they
“chose MIN6 cells because they express lower levels of insulin relative to primary cells”. This is
in contrast with other screening work where authors deliberately chose other cell-types due to the
higher basal level of insulin observed in MIN6 cells (Kiselyuk et al J Biomolec Screening 15 (6)
2010). It is known that MIN6 have variable amount of insulin among different clones (Yamato et
al. PlOsOne 2013, 8 (4) 1-12) and different passages of the same clone (Roderigo-Milne et al,
Biochem and Biophysic res Communic 296 (2002) 589-595). The same accounts for other ß-cell
markers, which lowers the reliability of MIN6 as a substrate for drug screening. Before using this
specific cell line, the authors should at least define the clone and the passages being used in their
experiments and should compare the levels of insulin with that of primary ß-cells.
The second concern arises from the specific use of Ins1 in the imaging vector. It is known that
while rodents have two insulin genes (Ins1 and Ins2), human possess only one gene and further
studies have revealed that the human Insulin gene has more similarity to the murine Ins2 gene
(Madadi et al. Biochem and Biophysic res Communic 376, (2008), 694-699), making this a more
relevant target than the Ins1 gene for screening studies. Furthermore, previous work has
demonstrated that MIN6 show differential expression of Ins1 and Ins2 with growing cellular
passage. In particular, the levels of Ins1 mRNA seem to diminish rapidly with continuous
passaging (Roderigo-Milne et al, Biochem and Biophysic res Communic 296 (2002) 589-595).
Therefore, for gene expression studies, both genes should be considered. Although the authors
have validated the screened “hits” by checking Ins1 and Ins2 mRNA expression by qPCR, the use
of Ins1 alone in the original screening may lead to false negative, meaning the authors may lose
interesting compounds by using Ins1 alone in their vector tool.
Another question regards the choice of one specific dose for the screening and the absence of
dose-response analysis for the screened “hits”. The authors used a final concentration of 8.5 µM
for all the drugs. However, the library contains different drug family members with different
mechanisms of action and different potency and efficacy. Are the authors sure that this dose will
provide an effect on the Ins1 and Pdx1 expression?
Minor issues
1) Please discuss the choice of using Pdx1 in the imaging tool. What evidence makes Pdx1 a
good marker to study ß cell maturation, instead of other well-known markers like Ucn3 or MafA
for example?
2) Why not using MIN6 for the electrophysiology study since ß-cells also express Na+
channels abundantly? This would make the story more coherent.
5
3) In the result section, first paragraph, line 43, please correct “mRNA positive” with
“mRFP positive”.
4) Please report the culture concentration of Hoechst 33342 used in the screening.
5) Please list the features of all the 9 groups of drugs in the result section. I believe that
group 1, which contained treatments that increased cell number without affecting expression of
Ins and Pdx1, also represent an interesting group with regard to ß cell maturity and
heterogeneity as the proliferative mode of ß cells also defines heterogeneous ß cell populations.
6) In the follow-up validation of the screened “hits” carbamazepine showed a significant
effect in increasing Ins1, Ins2 as well as Pdx1 expression (Fig 4). The author should therefore
modify the word “tendency” (page 8, line 32 of follow-up validation section).
7) It would be interesting to see whether carbamazepine also increased insulin content in
MIN6 as it would be expected due to the significant increase in mRNA expression.
8) The authors state that “carbamazepine was able to increase Ins1 mRNA even at low
doses, well below the doses at which this drug has statistically significant effect on ß-cell
survival”. However, to this point, the authors refer to a paper (ref 23) where the effect of
carbamazepine was evaluated in primary islet cells. To make such a statement, the author should
confirm that this effect holds true in their setting as well. Please state the specific concentration of
carbamazepine which gives ß-cell survival.
9) I do not personally get the conclusion from the in vivo work. Nav1.7 KO islets show high
insulin content and no significant changes in glucose-stimulated insulin release. Where does this
insulin go? It would be interesting to see what happens when these mice are in a diabetic
condition….
10) In the discussion, the authors refer to a previous screening work which identified Na+
channel modulators as potential regulators of insulin secretion in ß-cell lines. How do the
authors explain the discrepancy with the Nav1.7 KO mice, which do not show increase in insulin
secretion? To this regard, it would be good to perform glucose-stimulated insulin release with
carbamazepine in Min6 to have a direct link with insulin secretion.
11) Figure 1B. Please report the mRNA data for Pdx1 as well.
12) Figure 1B. Please show the data for the nuclear vector-immature cells also relative to the
original vector –immature cells to see whether the new method has differences in the amount of
Pdx1+/Inslow compared to the original vector. I would also report the percentages of
Pdx1+/Inslow and Pdx1+/Ins+ in MIN6 for both vectors to see whether the two models are
indeed comparable.

ntiviral reporter construct is transcriptionally isolated and does not contribute to the expression of eGFP
ndent of eGFP.
We thank the reviewer for raising this point. Based on the initial validation of this tool (Szabat et al 2009
Endocrinology) and subsequent papers where we have used it (Szabat et al 2010 Diabetologia; Szabat
et al 2011 Islets), we believe the Ins1 and Pdx1 reporters are acting independently. Importantly, if this
were the case, we would expect to see more GFP positive cells and we would not expect to see cells
make a transition from RFP to GFP, as we have previously published (Szabat et al 2009 Endocrinology;
Szabat et al 2011 Islets). The newly added FACS plots, requested below, also support this
interpretation.
S plots should be included of the sort at the basis of Figure 1b, preferably with an explanation of the full
strategy. One would expect populations of RFP single positive cells and GFP/RFP double positive cells
ut the FACS data will reveal the relative sizes of these populations, whether they resolve in discrete
ions, and if so, whether the mean intensities in each population shift with increased maturity.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have now included the FACS plots, as requested.
lding potential of -120 mV necessary to measure the effects of Carb on islet cells (Fig. 6C) or does Carb
rably impact sodium currents at a more physiologically relevant resting potential? If not, the positive
of this drug may indeed not be dependent on Nav1.7.

The holding potential we used is a requirement of observing Na currents in isolated beta-cells, not of
the drug’s action.
nclusion that Na+ channels are required for insulin production in the title and elsewhere is a bit strongly
. I agree that the modest increases in Ins1 reporter activity and Ins1 transcript and Scn9a-/- islets could
explained by increased insulin production. However, other explanations cannot be ruled out and the
ion of increased insulin production requires direct demonstration of increased insulin protein
hesis. It appears that the increased content in Scn9a-/- islets can equally well be explained by increased
ulation of insulin over time owing to the reduced glucose-stimulated insulin release in these islets, which
solated from mice at the relatively advanced age of 1 year. One would predict that other beta cell
es such as amylin would equally accumulate over time if the underlying mechanism for this result is a
exocytosis defect. Ultra-structural studies would be informative to compare the density of secretory
s in control and Scn9a-/- beta cells.
We agree that there are caveats, but also strengths, of using older mice in our study. We agree that our
studies of the Scn9a-/- cannot rule out a role for the slightly reduced secretion in the build-up of cellular
insulin, although we are not aware of definitive evidence that this occurs in non-stressed beta-cells.
However, we believe older mice better reflect the biology of human islets, which are typically isolated
from humans in their last third or quarter of life, and have similar blocks on proliferation and
regeneration. We agree that this study opens up many interesting questions for the future, including EM,
but we also believe these are beyond the scope of the current investigation.

ed their previously published imaging tool, allowing more automated analysis of drug screening. By
cting the MIN6 insulinoma cell line with their fluorescent reporter, the authors have screened more than a

azepine in insulin production. To strengthen their results, the authors used a combination of analytical

in concern is the choice of MIN6 for this high-content screen. The authors state that they “chose MIN6
ecause they express lower levels of insulin relative to primary cells”. This is in contrast with other
ng work where authors deliberately chose other cell-types due to the higher basal level of insulin
ed in MIN6 cells (Kiselyuk et al J Biomolec Screening 15 (6) 2010). It is known that MIN6 have variable
t of insulin among different clones (Yamato et al. PLOS One 2013, 8 (4) 1-12) and different passages of
me clone (Roderigo-Milne et al, Biochem and Biophysic res Communic 296 (2002) 589-595). The same
ts for other ß-cell markers, which lowers the reliability of MIN6 as a substrate for drug screening. Before
his specific cell line, the authors should at least define the clone and the passages being used in their
ents and should compare the levels of insulin with that of primary ß-cells.
Although there is certainly no perfect model for our purposes, we chose the MIN6 cell line very carefully.
We chose this model because the insulin levels in MIN6 cells in our hands are lower than what is
observed in primary cells. We have now made this clearer in the text. We apologize for not including
information on the passage and we have now amended the manuscript accordingly on page 4.
cond concern arises from the specific use of Ins1 in the imaging vector. It is known that while rodents
wo insulin genes (Ins1 and Ins2), human possess only one gene and further studies have revealed that
man Insulin gene has more similarity to the murine Ins2 gene (Madadi et al. Biochem and Biophysic res
unic 376, (2008), 694-699), making this a more relevant target than the Ins1 gene for screening studies.
more, previous work has demonstrated that MIN6 show differential expression of Ins1 and Ins2 with
g cellular passage. In particular, the levels of Ins1 mRNA seem to diminish rapidly with continuous
ing (Roderigo-Milne et al, Biochem and Biophysic res Communic 296 (2002) 589-595). Therefore, for
xpression studies, both genes should be considered. Although the authors have validated the screened
y checking Ins1 and Ins2 mRNA expression by qPCR, the use of Ins1 alone in the original screening may
false negative, meaning the authors may lose interesting compounds by using Ins1 alone in their vector
We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful comments and we are aware of the differences between Ins1
and Ins2. We have now added some text to the manuscript to further clarify our choice of Ins1. As
detailed in our previous publications (Szabat et al 2009 Endocrinology; Szabat et al 2010 Diabetologia;
Szabat et al 2011 Islets), the Ins1 promoter we are using is an excellent reporter of mature beta-cells,
even in human islets (Szabat et al 2011 Islets). Importantly, our screen with this promoter led to the
novel and unexpected results reported in this manuscript, so we are pleased with its performance as a
screening tool.
r question regards the choice of one specific dose for the screening and the absence of dose-response
s for the screened “hits”. The authors used a final concentration of 8.5 µM for all the drugs. However, the
contains different drug family members with different mechanisms of action and different potency and
. Are the authors sure that this dose will provide an effect on the Ins1 and Pdx1 expression?
We agree that this is a caveat of our study and we have now made this caveat clearer in the text on
page 5.

Please discuss the choice of using Pdx1 in the imaging tool. What evidence makes Pdx1 a good marker
y ß cell maturation, instead of other well-known markers like Ucn3 or MafA for example?
Actually, we are using the long Pdx1 promoter as a general marker for beta-cells here. As described in
our previous publications (Szabat et al 2009 Endocrinology; Szabat et al 2010 Diabetologia; Szabat et al
2011 Islets), cells with Ins1 promoter mature from the cells with low Pdx1 promoter activity. Therefore,
this Pdx1 promoter would better be described as a marker of immature beta-cells.
Why not using MIN6 for the electrophysiology study since ß-cells also express Na+ channels
ntly? This would make the story more coherent.

We have previous studied the effects of carbamazepine on primary beta-cells which have a mix of Na
current (although predominantly Nav1.7) and published these results (Yang et al 2014 Molecular
Endocrinology). However, the goal of this experiment was to use a heterologous system to specifically
look at the effect of the drug on this single gene product.
In the result section, first paragraph, line 43, please correct “mRNA positive” with “mRFP positive”.
Thank you. We have corrected this error.
Please report the culture concentration of Hoechst 33342 used in the screening.
The concentration is 50 ng/ml. This is reported in the ‘live cell imaging and high-content screening’
section of the Methods.
Please list the features of all the 9 groups of drugs in the result section. I believe that group 1, which
ed treatments that increased cell number without affecting expression of Ins and Pdx1, also represent an
ing group with regard to ß cell maturity and heterogeneity as the proliferative mode of ß cells also defines
eneous ß cell populations.
Thank you. We have added this information. The other groups contained drugs that were largely neutral
with regards to the measured parameters.
In the follow-up validation of the screened “hits” carbamazepine showed a significant effect in increasing
s2 as well as Pdx1 expression (Fig 4). The author should therefore modify the word “tendency” (page 8,
of follow-up validation section).
Thank you. We have corrected this error.
It would be interesting to see whether carbamazepine also increased insulin content in MIN6 as it would
ected due to the significant increase in mRNA expression.
We thank the reviewer for suggesting this interesting experiment, although it is not clear whether we
would expect to see an increase in total content in the time frame of cell culture in these relatively de-
differentiated and rapidly dividing immortalized cells. Indeed, we have now performed analysis of insulin
content and we were unable to see significant differences in the time frames we studied (24 hours, 48
hours). We believe that it is possible that these time frames, or any other time frame, might be too short
to see insulin protein accumulation from the increase in mRNA levels. Its important to note that insulin
content was increased in vivo over a very long time period (months).
The authors state that “carbamazepine was able to increase Ins1 mRNA even at low doses, well below
ses at which this drug has statistically significant effect on ß-cell survival”. However, to this point, the
refer to a paper (ref 23) where the effect of carbamazepine was evaluated in primary islet cells. To make
statement, the author should confirm that this effect holds true in their setting as well. Please state the
concentration of carbamazepine which gives ß-cell survival.
We have now clarified this statement.
I do not personally get the conclusion from the in vivo work. Nav1.7 KO islets show high insulin content
significant changes in glucose-stimulated insulin release. Where does this insulin go? It would be
ing to see what happens when these mice are in a diabetic condition….
Our data suggests that insulin accumulates in the Nav1.7 KO islets, likely due to an increase in insulin
mRNA synthesis. Our main conclusion from the in vivo work is that loss-of-function of the gene has a
similar effect as inhibition with the drug. We agree that these are not identical experiments, but we think
they are complementary and strengthen the conclusions.
In the discussion, the authors refer to a previous screening work which identified Na+ channel
tors as potential regulators of insulin secretion in ß-cell lines. How do the authors explain the discrepancy
e Nav1.7 KO mice, which do not show increase in insulin secretion? To this regard, it would be good to
glucose-stimulated insulin release with carbamazepine in Min6 to have a direct link with insulin
on.
We agree that this would be an interesting experiment. We have now conducted such an experiment
and found no significant differences. We have already published the results of experiments designed to
examine insulin secretion in the context of carbamazepine in primary cells.
Figure 1B. Please report the mRNA data for Pdx1 as well.
All of the cells we studied are positive for mRPF (the Pdx1 reporter), so we do not expect any difference
in Pdx1 mRNA. We have confirmed this in recent experiments, but want to keep Fig 1 relatively simple
to emphasize the focus on insulin production. This should also be more clear now that the FACS plots
have been added.
Figure 1B. Please show the data for the nuclear vector-immature cells also relative to the original vector
ure cells to see whether the new method has differences in the amount of Pdx1+/Inslow compared to the
vector. I would also report the percentages of Pdx1+/Inslow and Pdx1+/Ins+ in MIN6 for both vectors to
ether the two models are indeed comparable.
The promoters are exactly the same, only the fluorescent protein localizations are different. The bottom
lines is that our approach identified modulators of insulin production.
Figure 3C. Please mark the selected drugs in the cell number graph as well.
The drugs are ordered by cell number, so this should already be clear.
