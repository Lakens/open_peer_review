Major comments:
I suggest the authors organize their manuscript in a logical way, and present their data in a
simple and direct way. It’s better if they provide a hypothesis for their study. The language
should also be polished by an English-speaking expert.
L15-24 What is the difference between “gene expression analysis” and “GO and KEGG
analyses”? Each analysis produced different numbers of differential genes between libraries.
Why?
L24 Why were the six genes chosen?
L66 Ophiocordyceps sinensis and Hirsutella sinensis are representing the same species. The
fungus is known to produce undetectable cordycepin.
L113-117 Primers ITS1 and ITS4 are actually amplifying the ITS region instead of 18S rDNA. PCR
extension time of 90 s at 72<U+2103> is too long for the 500-bp ITS region.
L155-156 Are “cultured in canned bottles” and “buried in soil” describing the same thing?
L238-250 The paragraph can be simplified to avoid duplicating methods.
L253 What’s the difference between a unigene and a transcript? In later parts of the manuscript, it
seems that only unigenes were analyzed, and transcripts were not mentioned again.
L311, L314, and other parts. It’s not a conventional way to show and cite data by providing the
file name directly in the text.
The subsection 3.5 is partially duplicating subsection 3.2.
Minor comments:
L27 are responsible
L34 Cordycipitaceae is a family name and Cordyceps is a genus name.
L47 O. sinensis
L105-106 What’s the difference between fruiting body and stromata?
L126 “strain buc” should not be italic.
Figure 5B The venn diagram is unusual. Each big circle should be a library instead of a

In the manuscript, the authors provide the first comparative transcriptomic data of Cordyceps
cicadae, one of the most famous fungi as traditional Chinese medicinal material. In addition, the
authors were also trying to identify genes related to cordycepin biosynthesis. This study
improved our understanding of secondary metabolism in C. cicadae. The study is solid and the
results reported are interesting. The manuscript is also nicely written. Therefore, this manuscript
is worth publication. Following please a few examples to improve this manuscript.
1) Line 51 The second and subsequent generic name Cordyceps in the text should be abbreviated.
2) Replace Ophiocordyceps sinensis with Cordyceps sinensis.
3) Line 131 should be Figure 2F.
4) Line 331, the species name should be italicized. Please make sure all species names are
italicized in this manuscript.
5) Line 347 should be “GO”.
6) The text in Figures 3-5 are too small to read.
7) The Figures should be clearly referenced, which should be “Figure S3A”, instead of “Figure S3
A”. Please correct all in throughout the whole manuscript.

This manuscript (MS) RSOS-181247 reported the “Identification of Cordycepin Biosynthesis-

The MS is relatively well written, scientifically sound and the outcomes are relatively well
explained, and it is of interest to the readership of Royal Society Open Science. Therefore, I
recommend its acceptance for publication after major revision.
The MS needs an extensive proofreading. There are extra full points and missing spaces between
words and references. I strong suggest reviewing all the citations, there are two changed
references. I also recommend looking after the Royal Society Open Science rules for authors,
example: Fig. 2 or Figure 2; Figure S1 or Fig. S1.

Referee’s Comments:
This manuscript (MS) RSOS-181247 reported the “Identification of Cordycepin
Biosynthesis-related genes through de novo transcriptome assembly and analysis of
Cordyceps cicadae”.
The MS is relatively well written, scientifically sound and the outcomes are relatively
well explained, and it is of interest to the readership of Royal Society Open Science.
Therefore, I recommend its acceptance for publication after major revision.
The MS needs an extensive proofreading. There are extra full points and missing spaces
between words and references. I strong suggest reviewing all the citations, there are two
changed references. I also recommend looking after the Royal Society Open Science rules
for authors, example: Fig. 2 or Figure 2; Figure S1 or Fig. S1.
The table with annotation results is not available (Supplementary Materials: The
annotation analysis result of DEGs.xlsx).
Line 38: “…macrolides, and other metabolites[1].”
It should be “…macrolides, and metabolites [1].”
Lines 38 to 41: the authors described many studies of cordycepin function but did not
cited the reference (ref) of each study. I recommend citing the reference for each function:
immunoregulation [ref], renal function [ref], anti-fatigue [ref], anti-aging [ref], and anti-
tumor properties [ref]; and promotes hemopoietic function [ref], sedation [ref], and
hypnosis [ref].

with the name. For example: (A) c19459g1 (ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase
subunit M1, RRMI1). I also recommend writing the gene names in the Figure 6 below
the graphics, next to the contig name: c19459g1 (RRMI1).
Appendix B
Dear Editor:
We are truly grateful to yours and other reviewers’ critical comments and
thoughtful suggestions. Based on these comments and suggestions, we have
made careful modifications on the original manuscript. All changes made to
the text are in red color. In addition, we have consulted a native English
speakers and Dr. Ying Huang for paper revision before the submission this
time. We hope the new manuscript will meet your magazine’s standard. Below
you will find our point-by-point responses to the reviewers’ comments/
questions.
Response to reviewer 1 major comments:
After examining your comments carefully, we must admit that we have not
expressed our meaning directly in the previous manuscript. In the revised
version, we reorganized the means of expression, we integrated section 3.1,3.5
and 3.2 and marked red, and proposed our hypothesis of cordycepin
biosynthesis pathway in C.cicadae in Figure 7. As suggested by the reviewer,
we have invited an native English speaker to polished our manuscript.
Reponse to L15-24, Gene expression analysis in our manscuript was
Differential expression analysis, in order to identify differentially expressed
genes(DGEs), and GO and KEGG analyses were aim to class the identified
DGEs to metabolic pathways in C.cicadae. And Differential expression
analysis has replaced in line 15. We conducted three comparisons, 1 mycelium
(control) versus fruiting body, 2 mycelium (control) versus sclerotium, and 3
fruiting body (control) versus sclerotium, and they produced different numbers
of differential genes due to the cordycepin contents differed, highest (Table 2)
in the sclerotium (embedded with sterile wet soil and total cultured for 29
days),then fruiting body samples, cordycepin was not detected in mycelium
samples.
Response to Line 24 Why were the six genes chosen? In the literature
of previously reported, the 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase has been
proved to involved in cordycepin biosynthesis pathway, and RRM1 ,NDK
were significantly up-regulated in mycelium (control) versus sclerotium.
Response to Line 66. Ophiocordyceps sinensis and Hirsutella
sinensis are representing…… We are sorry for our negligence of this
and thanks for your suggesstions.
Response to Line 113-117 We use Taq PCR Mix to amplifying the ITS
region, and the length of PCR products was 534 bp, PCR extension time of 90
s at 72<U+2103> is too long and in the future experiment we will decrease the extension
time to 45 s, and we are sorry to Ignore the problem.Thanks for your kind
remind.
Response L155-156 The cultured in canned bottles means after inoculated
in Chinese Tussah silkmoth pupae,they were cultured in an empty canned
bottles Figure2 A-D, and buried in soil means pupae were then embedded in
canned bottles(10 cm×15 cm, diameter×134 height) with sterile wet soil and
allowed to form sclerotium for 10 days with a 16:8-h. This was added in
section 2.1 and maked red.
Response to L238-250 This paragraph has been simplified and thanks for
your kind advise.
Response to L253 What’s the difference between a unigene and a
transcript?
Because eukaryotes have variable shear, a gene may correspond to multiple
transcripts; unigenes are the longest assembled transcripts and transcripts were
also analyzed in our original research, unigenes have coved the analysis results
of transcripts.
Response to L311, L314, and other parts.
All supplementary material section have been replaced by “electronic
supplementary material,name”. We are sorry for our negligence of this. We
deleted the section 3.5 and insert into section 3.2.
Response to reviewer 1 minor comments:
Line 27 has been revised to “ are responsible”.
Line 34 has added genus before Cordyceps.
Line 47 was also revised to O. sinensis.
Line 105-106 Stromata was the mat-like structure which formed by mycelium
combines with host substrate. And fruiting body was a multicellular structure
on which spore-producing structures.
L126 “strain buc” has been changed normal.
Figure 5B has corrected as MF, FS and MS.
Response to reviewer 2
Thank you very much for your kindly comments on our manuscript . Based on
your suggestions, we carefully revised the manuscript.
1) Cordyceps in the text has been abbreviated;
2) Ophiocordyceps sinensis were more used than Cordyceps sinensis and we
unifed in O. sinensis in the whole manscuript.
3) I think the reviewer means Line131 was line 141,and Fig.2F has been
replaced with Figure 2F
4) Line 331;the species names have be italicized in whole mancuript.
5) Line 347 GO has been revised in the title of section 3.2 .
6) Text in figure3-5 has been enlarged
7). The referenced format of Figures throughout whole manscuript have been
corrected.
Response to reviewer 3

magazine’s standard. Below you will find our point-by-point responses to the
reviewers’ comments/ questions:
Response to reviewer1
After examining the reviewer’s comments carefully.
The title has been revised.
Introduction Cordyceps cicadae indeed can parasitize many hosts and we
revised this confusion.
3.2 We delete the last sentence and this was indicated in 3.3 RNA extraction.
3.3 Because we select three comparsions due to the cordycepin
contents,according to the results of HPLC determination. The cordycepin
contents were highest (table 2) in the sclerotium (embedded with sterile wet
soil and cultured for 29 days), followed by the fruiting bodies; cordycepin
was not detected in mycelium samples.
4.1 Mycelium-1-3 has been replaced.
Literatures All authors were listed consistent with papers for literature
