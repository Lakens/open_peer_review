Characterization of puma – livestock conflicts in rangelands of Central Argentina.
Form and editorial comments
1. Reference 23 has a more recent version, available to the authors upon request.
2. We recommend changing the word “cat” to “feline” in the whole manuscript.
3. Figure 1 in the actual PDF version is not clear; it is not possible to identify both counties from
the small illustration to the left. Maybe a very black line between both counties would facilitate
their identification allowing to cut away the left map and making the right map bigger? I
recommend eliminating the main road lines. The “Espinal Ecoregion” in the study area presents
the same pattern as the outer non-studied area, this should be changed.
4. Caption of Figure 1 needs to be corrected (maps to map), either all in singular or all in plural.
5 Line 151: m.a.s.l. not m a.s.l.
6. Lines 190 – 193: Meat price, head numbers and currency exchange rates, change quickly, we
recommend a clarification such as “at the moment of writing the manuscript”
7. Lines 224-231: Can be resumed in a Table. It is important there is correspondence of data in
these paragraph and Appendix A. Values differ.
8. Line 237: Figure 2 Use bars instead of circles.
3
9. Lines 238-243: Information can be resumed in a Table.
10. Lines 238 – 239: Values of livestock losses in Villarino and Patagones in the text are not the
same as in Figure 2.
11. Line 255: Appendix C is a figure not a Table this needs to be corrected in the text. Part b)
Patagones of the Figure “Appendix C” needs to be adjusted according to its range (0 to 2000, not
4000).
12. From Line 262 on: When sample size is given, this should be with an “n” not a capital “N”,
review scientific notation.
13. Lines 298 – 300: Unity in notation and units. Either: individuals / year, or individuals / km2
or individual / year / km2, but always the same in each group, as to be able to make
comparisons.
14. Line 333: instead of costs – losses.
Content comments.
1. Lines 114-115: In the Introduction, it is important not only to mention that pumas were listed as
pests for many years (Ley Nacional Nº 4863). Only in the Discussion lines 415 – 417 is a better
explanation of the legal status of Pumas in the area studied. This should be addressed in the
Introduction.
2. Line 115-117: The paper mentioned that pumas have returned in recent decades however the
references are from the years 2005 and 2000, given that the mentioned references are 11 and 17
years old, are there more recent publications in relation to the actual status of pumas in
Argentina? If the answer is no, the phrasing should be changed.
3. Lines 140 – 145: In relation to the six objectives: a) depredation rate; b) quantification of losses;
c) spatial-temporal depredation patterns; d) effect of husbandry practices; e) puma mortality
rates; f) relation of depredation and puma hunting. However, most of the information proceeds
from interviews to stockowners. Experience and many publications indicate that the depredation
problems tend to be perceived as more serious than they actually are. It is important that this is
addressed in the Introduction and in the Discussion, experience has showed that one thing is
what stakeholders perceive, another what really happens, when actual research is conducted that
does not rely on the perception of the interviewees.
4. Although the paper states that the areas that contain grasslands and shrubs are the areas with
the most depredations, when observing Figure 1, most of the interviews have been maintained in
the cropland area, this bias should be addressed in the Discussion specifically in the Patagones
County.
5. Line 176: A stratified random sampling is a method of sampling that involves the division of a
population into smaller groups known as strata. What were the inclusion and exclusion criteria
for the strata? How many strata? How were they classified?
6. Line 179: How was the honesty of the answers evaluated? If no control questions were applied
it is not possible to evaluate how honest the answers were. This needs to be addressed.
7. Lines 204 – 205: How do authors know that the number of cattle heads was larger than the
number of sheep? It is possible to review records of the agriculture and secretaries etc. to have
approximate number of cattle for the area; otherwise any numerical assumption is invalid.
8. Line 209 and on: It is important to characterize the environmental conditions in which
depredation occurs. However, depredation tends to happen in the places were the prey is
available, the question arises as to where the sheep are kept. Are sheep kept in woodlands? If the
answer is no, then, the only conclusion the Jacobs index provides is that there is internal validity,
since the test corroborated that there was no sheep predation in woodlands b/s no sheep were
kept in woodlands. This needs to be addressed.
9. Lines 244 – 246: …Puma predation was greater than expected…” What values were expected?
How were the expectations calculated? Based on what?
10. Line 249 and on: All result expressed in % should have an “n” (sample size) available.
11. Means and medians: Given that most data presented in this manuscript do not seem to have a
normal distribution, a better measure of centrality should be the median, especially considering
the incredible large SD. CI as a measure of the dispersion of the distribution is more appropriate
especially when comparisons between different sets are made.
12. Figure 4, Line 259: How were the “odds of predation” calculated? Or, do the authors mean the
4
log transformed number of predation events? This needs to be addressed because it is not the
same. Given that the relationship between odds of predation and number of stock is extremely
weak, authors should consider if this analysis is adequate. There is no residual vs. fit plot or
explanation, which would allow to identify if the assumption of a relationship is reasonable
(linear); if the data form a relatively horizontal line around 0 suggesting that the variance of the
error terms are equal; and above all that no residual stands out, suggesting outliers, which will
probably not be the case, considering some extremely scattered data points.
13. Line 297: Define age in months of the calves; it is not the same a calf of 5 months than a calf of
1 month, these differences are important.
14. Line 307: Specify which ranch (B?)
15. Lines 314 – 315: It is important to clarify if sheep are kept in woodlands, if not this should be
addressed in the manuscript.
16. Line 340 – 341: It seems logical that pumas are the focal point of conflict, given the scarcity or
total eradication of other large carnivores.
17. Lines 359 – 360: Why are abortions, weight loss and milk production decrease linked to
predation events? Is this a statement of the interviewees, or an argument of the authors? What is
the conceptualization behind this link? Where is the reference? This needs to be addressed.
18. Lines 403 – 405. One of the most important points presented in this study is that nocturnal
corralling not always functioned as a management strategy to decrease predation. Indeed,
sometimes it encourages surplus killing, producing huge losses to stockowners. Experience (and
literature support) indicates that it is one of the most efficient measures to control predation,
especially in young sheep and calves. However, the big difference in corralling is, that they are
usually designed to keep stock “inside” and not predators “outside”. The corrals were probably
not designed to keep the predators out (maybe ranch B), but the stock in; which is one of the most
common mistakes made when using corrals. This needs to be addressed in the Discussion. Do the
authors have data to corroborate the intention and function of the corrals? If not, then the doubt
will prevail as to what kind of corrals were used. Although the prevailing attitude along the
range of large felines is “the good feline, is the dead feline”, maybe the reason why the majority
of ranchers claimed that lethal control is the most adequate measure, is that the available
solutions are lacking. Sheepdogs, Fladry fencing, bells, bells with lights and predator proved
corrals have showed remarkably good results, especially with Pumas.

Associate Editor's comments:
Both reviewers are generally positive about the manuscript. However, they both highlight some
inconsistencies in the results and discussion and some potential areas of concern. Many of these
can probably be easily addressed. However, it is difficult to assess how substantiave the concerns
are without a conscientious revision.

49 livestock conflicts in Villarino and Patagones counties of central Argentinean rangelands.
7
8
50 Depredation was considered the major cause of livestock losses, and puma attacks were reported in
9 51 46.6% and 35.4% of ranches in Villarino and Patagones, respectively. The majority of ranches
10 52 underwent losses smaller than 1000 USD. The proportion of livestock lost to predation (0.1-10.4%)
11 53 and financial losses (5.3-1560.4 USD) per ranch/year varied across ranches and small sheep ranches
12 54 in Villarino were affected the most. Depredation was recorded only at night and preferentially in
13 55 grassland with shrubs and cropland habitats. Although nocturnal enclosures appeared to decrease
14 56 sheep losses, puma hunting was considered the most effective form of reducing depredation and
15 57 was implemented by most ranchers. Mortality rates were 3.7 and 1.1-1.56 individuals/year x
16
58 100km2 for sheep and pumas, respectively. Nocturnal fencing, shepherding and spatial separation
17
18
59 from predators may efficiently reduce sheep losses. However, the poor association between the
19 60 intensity of puma persecution and puma-related livestock losses suggests that conflict mitigation in
20 61 central Argentina is not only about reducing damage but also about increasing tolerance.

3 92 1. INTRODUCTION
4
5 93 Most large carnivores have undergone marked declines in both population size and geographic
6
7 94 range and because of increasing encroachment with human activities, the maintenance of viable
8
9
10 95 populations across much of their range ultimately depends upon mitigating conflict with humans
11
12 96 (1). Predation on livestock is viewed as one of the major causes of this conflict and consequently, a
13
14 97 major driver of the depletion of large carnivore populations worldwide (2, 3, 4). Predicting the
15
16 98 outcomes of carnivore-human conflicts for both components of this equation may be challenging,
17
18
99 because it requires assessment of human responses, as well as those of the carnivores (5). However,
19
20
21 100 this knowledge is critical within a context where an increasing proportion of carnivore populations
22
23 101 live entirely within productive agricultural and ranching systems and their survival is almost
24
25 102 completely dependent on a sustainable coexistence with humans (3, 6, 7).
26
27 103 Pumas (Puma concolor) are thought to perform a regulatory function in ecosystems by influencing
28
29
30 104 prey and smaller predator behaviors and population abundances (8, 9). In spite of this important role
31
32 105 in ecosystems and of the fact that this felid is the wild carnivore with the largest distribution in the
33
34 106 Americas, puma ecology in South America is still relatively understudied, especially in areas with
35
36 107 intense human activity, where human-carnivore conflicts tend to be intense.
37
38
108 Presently, the puma is the most widespread top predator and one of the most conflictive carnivores
39
40
41 109 in Argentina (10, 11). Pumas were historically present in almost the entire territory of Argentina.
42
43 110 Thanks to its ecological plasticity, this species is relatively tolerant to anthropogenic disturbance
44
45 111 and maintains populations in some human-modified landscapes (12, 13). Nevertheless, in the last
46
47 112 two centuries, since the colonization by Europeans, hunting of wild prey and extensive conversion
48
49
50 113 of natural habitat into ranchland and farmland have increased encroachment with humans and
51
52 114 predation on livestock (14). In this scenario, pumas were listed as pests for many years by a national
53
54 115 law in Argentina (Ley Nacional N° 4863). In the second half of the last century, this feline was
55
56 116 extirpated from most of Patagonia, where had returned only in recent decades (15), and from large
57
58
117 portions of the Pampas (16). More recently, the advance of the agriculture frontier and illegal
59
60 3

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 4 of 35
1
2
3 118 hunting caused a decline in puma population numbers and distribution in northeastern Argentina
4
5 119 (17) and the southern part of Buenos Aires province (18, 19). Livestock depredation by pumas often
6
7 120 leads to retaliatory responses by agro-pastoralists, including opposition to wildlife sanctuaries,
8
9
10 121 resistance to reintroduction of extirpated predators in protected areas as well as direct puma
11
12 122 persecution (13, 20, 21, 22). These conflicts are associated to deterioration in ecosystem dynamics
13
14 123 whose final consequence could be local population extinction (23, 22).
15
16 124 Although societal, cultural and behavioral factors influence the decision by people to persecute
17
18
125 large predators (3, 24, 25), in rural areas where livestock is an important source of income, livestock
19
20
21 126 losses affect local people attitudes towards, and acceptance of large felids (e.g., 25, 26, 27, 28, 29).
22
23 127 Economic losses caused by large cat predation of domestic species have been documented
24
25 128 worldwide (e.g., 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35), including in the Americas (e.g., 4, 27, 36, 37, 38).
26
27 129 However, the estimates of the effects of puma depredation are often too rough to enable an
28
29
30 130 understanding of its importance for local economies. Additionally, only a few studies explored the
31
32 131 effects of conflicts associated to livestock predation both for local people and for the predators
33
34 132 suffering retaliations (6, 28, 36, 39).

134 1.1 Objectives
40
41 135 The present study aimed to characterize and quantify puma-livestock conflicts in a human-
42
43 136 dominated landscape of central Argentina. Our results are intended to increase our understanding of
44
45 137 the factors affecting carnivore-livestock conflicts globally and provide information fundamental for
46
47 138 the elaboration of effective conflict mitigation and conservation management strategies to guarantee
48
49
50 139 both puma preservation and the viability of ranching activities in this region, where puma hunting is
51
52 140 illegal. Specifically, we estimated the rate of puma predation on livestock (“depredation”
53
54 141 henceforward), quantified the losses caused to livestock ranchers, identified spatial-temporal
55
56 142 depredation patterns, and explored the effect of husbandry practices on depredation. Additionally,
57
58
143 we estimated puma mortality rates and investigated the effect of depredation on puma hunting by
59
60 4

3 144 ranchers. To independently validate some of these estimates, we carried out a comparison between
4
5 145 interview-based, landscape-scale data and information obtained from direct surveys in a sub-area.

11
12 148 2.1 Study Area
13
14 149 We carried out our study in an area of 23 630 km2 located in the southern part of Buenos Aires
15
16 150 Province, central Argentina, and corresponding to Villarino and Patagones counties (Fig. 1). The
17
18
151 study area belongs to the Argentinean Espinal ecoregion. Located at an average of 700 m a.s.l., this
19
20
21 152 ecoregion is mostly flat. Climate is semiarid and the mean annual temperature is 15.3 °C. The
22
23 153 annual precipitation varies from 350 to 500 mm and falls mainly in spring and autumn (40). The
24
25 154 natural vegetation is characterized by xerophytic deciduous woodlands (dominated by Prosopis
26
27 155 caldenia), prairies intermixed with natural patches of spontaneous scrub vegetation (also called
28
29
30 156 grasslands with scrubs) and grassland prairies (41). The Espinal is still inhabited by a diverse
31
32 157 vertebrate community, including several carnivores and a unique array of herbivores (42). However,
33
34 158 this region has experienced a marked transformation during the last decades due to the
35
36 159 intensification of crop cultivation and ranching activities, which are the primary sources of income
37
38
160 (43). The ongoing logging to create arable fields led to a habitat loss and fragmentation process that
39
40
41 161 converted the original landscape into a mosaic of croplands with patches of natural vegetation (43).
42
43 162 Overgrazing has caused widespread degradation of soil and vegetation (44).
44
45 163 Although the two counties included in our study area have similar sizes, they show several
46
47 164 differences that make their comparison meaningful. Biogeographically, Villarino is characterized by
48
49
50 165 more closed xerophilous shrubby and spiny vegetation than Patagones where shrubby steppe is the
51
52 166 dominant vegetation. Villarino also has a greater proportion of taller Prosopis caldenia woodlands.
53
54 167 According to the most recent official census (2015, Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y Calidad
55
56 168 Agroalimentaria), the two counties also differed largely in the characteristics of livestock farming in
57
58
169 the study period. Villarino had a greater number of smaller properties (i.e., ranches) than Patagones.

3 170 On average, Villarino ranches had a greater quantity of cattle than Patagones, whereas ranches
4
5 171 tended to focus more on sheep in Patagones (Appendix A).

7 172
8
9
10 173 2.2 Data collection and analyses
11
12 174 Data collection lasted from 2007 to 2015 and was based on interviews to local inhabitants and direct
13
14 175 inspection of depredation sites. To obtain data on puma–livestock conflict and the perceptions and
15
16 176 attitudes of local people towards the puma, we personally visited a stratified random sample of
17
18
177 ranches and interviewed farmers and ranchers who worked there. Semi-structured interviews were
19
20
21 178 conducted by two or three researchers in each case as face-to-face informal dialogues in order to
22
23 179 create a friendly interaction between interviewers and interviewee and obtain honest answers. At the
24
25 180 end of the interview, a standard questionnaire, comprising both open and closed questions, was
26
27 181 filled. To avoid spatial autocorrelation, we selected interview sites that were at least 4 km apart
28
29
30 182 (Fig. 1). A range of data about the presence of key vertebrate species, their habitat association and
31
32 183 respondents’ perceptions towards them were recorded, but we focused here on questions regarding
33
34 184 depredation by pumas and ranchers responses to it. Because hunting of pumas is illegal in our study
35
36 185 area, we stated clearly at the beginning of each interview that we were from a non-governmental
37
38
186 organization and that all information provided would be treated anonymously. Because interviews
39
40
41 187 did not follow a rigid scheme and we wanted the ranchers to feel comfortable, some of the
42
43 188 interviewees did not answer to all the questions and, as a consequence, sample sizes may vary
44
45 189 across topics.
46
47 190 To estimate the financial losses caused by puma depredation, we used an average body weight of
48
49
50 191 each type of livestock and its average annual market value in Argentine Pesos and multiplied this
51
52 192 value by the number of livestock heads lost. Finally, to standardize results we applied the average
53
54 193 Argentine Pesos/USD rate of exchange.
55
56 194 Also, we tested the hypothesis resulting from previous studies on big cat-livestock conflicts (45, 46,
57
58
195 47) that the implementation of livestock husbandry practices, such as nocturnal corralling, would
59
60 6
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 7 of 35 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 196 reduce predation rates. For this analysis, we limited our study to ranches that bred only sheep,
4
5 197 because local ranchers believe that cattle are less vulnerable to puma predation and because they
6
7 198 adopt extensive, free ranging breeding for cattle.
8
9
10 199 From 2013 to 2015, during 24 months we surveyed intensively an area of Patagones county
11
12 200 (Appendix B) to validate the information obtained by interviews we personally checked all puma
13
14 201 depredation events and puma kills reported by local ranchers. This area covered 513 km2 and was
15
16 202 largely covered by woodlands (49.6%), followed by grassland with bushes (23.7%), grassland
17
18
203 (19.5%), and cropland (7.2%) and comprised 12 ranches; all of them bred cattle and four also raised
19
20
21 204 sheep. Sheep totaled 970 heads (1.89 sheep/km2). The number of cattle heads was unknown but was
22
23 205 much greater than that of sheep.
24
25 206 With the data recorded in this sub-area, we also tested the hypothesis that puma depredation was
26
27 207 associated with sites and times of the day in which the risk of encountering humans was low (47,
28
29
30 208 48, 49). Particularly, we predicted that depredation events on livestock would occur (1) in areas far
31
32 209 from rancher houses, (2) mostly at night time, and (3) in proximity of areas with dense vegetation
33
34 210 cover (woodlands and grassland with shrubs). To test these predictions, we calculated the distances
35
36 211 from each depredation site to the nearest house as well as to the closest patches of woodland and
37
38
212 grassland with shrubs. T-test was subsequently used to compare these distances to those calculated
39
40
41 213 for 15 points randomly placed inside the corrals where sheep were present. To analyze habitat
42
43 214 characteristics in relation to depredation sites, we applied a buffer of 100 m to the plots used by
44
45 215 sheep as well as to the depredation sites and then used the proportional habitat composition of these
46
47 216 two groups to calculate the value of the Jacobs index of selection for each habitat (50). The values
48
49
50 217 of this index may vary from -1 (indicative of total avoidance) to +1 (indicative of complete
51
52 218 preference). Habitat variables were calculated using ArcGIS (ESRI 2010. ArcGIS Desktop: Release
53
54 219 10. Redlands, CA: Environmental Systems Research Institute). Statistical analyses were performed
55
56 220 using R v. 3.0.1 (51).

4
5 223 3.1 Characterization of Interviewee and ranches
6
7 224 We completed 111 and 102 interviews in Villarino and Patagones county, respectively. The average
8
9
10 225 age of respondents was 49.6 years (SD=12.7 years; N=178) and most (85.8%) were males.
11
12 226 Although the sizes of the properties we surveyed varied greatly, on average they tended to be
13
14 227 greater in Patagones (23.5 km2; SD=34.7 km2; range=0.14-200 km2; N=94) than Villarino (18.4
15
16 228 km2; SD=35.4 km2; range=0.25-312 km2; N=99). Livestock breeding was carried out in 92.8% and
17
18
229 97.1% of the surveyed properties in Villarino and Patagones, respectively. In Villarino, 51.4% of
19
20
21 230 the ranches had both cattle and sheep, 22.3% cattle only and 26.2% sheep only. In Patagones,
22
23 231 69.7% of the ranches kept herds of sheep and cattle, 26.3% cattle only and 4% sheep only.
24
25 232
26
27 233 3.2 Livestock losses
28
29
30 234 Carnivore predation, climate changes, rustling, and livestock diseases were the causes of livestock
31
32 235 loss most frequently mentioned by ranchers (Fig. 2). Although variations were detected between the
33
34 236 two counties (Villarino, N=24 interviews; Patagones, N=28), depredation was consistently
35
36 237 considered the most important cause of livestock losses (Fig. 2).
37
38
238 Livestock losses due to puma attacks were reported in a greater proportion of ranches in Villarino
39
40
41 239 (46.6%; N=48) than Patagones (35.4%; N=35) (<U+03C7>2=7.3; p<0.05). In Villarino depredation was
42
43 240 reported, for the year previous to our interviews, in 30 (56.6%) mixed ranches (cattle and sheep),
44
45 241 44.4% (N=12) of ranches breeding sheep only, and 26% (N=6) of those with cattle only. For
46
47
48
242 Patagones, two (50%) ranches raising sheep only reported depredation, 31 (44.9%) of mixed
49
50 243 ranches and two (7.7%) of those with cattle only.
51
52 244 Overall, puma predation was greater than expected only for sheep in Villarino, whereas in
53
54 245 Patagones predation on sheep was in accordance with sheep availability. Predation on cattle was
55
56
246 less than expected in both counties (Fig. 3).

2
3 247 On average, the numbers and proportions of livestock killed as well as the economic losses
4
5 248 attributed to pumas tended to be greater in Villarino than Patagones (Tab. 1). However, depredation
6
7 249 losses varied considerably among ranches. In Villarino, the ranges of losses were 0.1-51.9% for
8
9
10 250 sheep and 2.1-3.3% for cattle in relation to living stock. In Patagones, sheep losses ranged from 0.7
11
12 251 to 86.7%, while predation on cattle was recorded in only one ranch and corresponded to 0.4% of its
13
14 252 stock.
15
16 253 If we consider only those ranches where puma depredation occurred, the financial losses averaged 3
17
18
254 398.4 USD per ranch per year (SD=8 729.4 USD) for Villarino and 1 059.5 USD (SD=1 587.1
19
20
21 255 USD) in Patagones. Although the economic losses varied largely across individual ranches (Tab. 1;
22
23 256 Appendix C), in both counties the majority of ranches underwent losses smaller than 1 000 USD
24
25 257 (76.5% in Villarino; 75% in Patagones; Appendix C).
26
27 258 Pooling the data from the two counties, a negative relationship was found between the stock of
28
29
30 259 individual ranches and the (logit-transformed) percentage of losses they endured (R2= -0.18; Fig. 4).
31
32 260
33
34 261 3.3 Ranchers’ attitudes
35
36 262 In Villarino, 67.3% of all the respondents (N=52) hunted pumas; 47.6% admitted that they had
37
38
263 killed pumas in the previous 5 years and they estimated to have killed at least 57 individuals in total
39
40
41 264 (11.4 pumas/year). Snares (34.6%; N=9) were the most common hunting techniques used in this
42
43 265 county, but people also frequently used fire arms, occasionally combined with dogs (26.9%; N=7),
44
45 266 and live-baited traps (26.9%; N=7). In Patagones, 82.5% of the respondents (N=57) reported that
46
47 267 they used to hunt pumas and 29% had killed pumas in the previous 5 years. As a result, a minimum
48
49
50 268 of 34 pumas were killed in that period (6.8 pumas/year). Fire arms (45.7%; N=32) and snares
51
52 269 (31.4%; N=22) were the most commonly mentioned techniques to hunt pumas in Patagones.
53
54 270 Retaliation for depredation was not the only reason for hunting pumas. Only 31.9% of the ranchers
55
56 271 who killed pumas had suffered livestock losses due to predation in Patagones compared to 77.8%
57
58
272 for Villarino.

5 274 3.4 Mitigation measures adopted by ranchers
6
7 275 In Villarino, 57.1% of the ranches with sheep (N=35) enclosed their sheep at night and 3.8% used
8
9
10 276 guard animals (dogs and donkeys). 80% of the ranches sheltering sheep in enclosures during the
11
12 277 night (N=20) suffered puma depredation. The ranches using corrals reported the loss of 8.7±11.29
13
14 278 sheep/ranch or 1.64% of the total stock, whereas those that did not adopt this practice lost 5.2±13.2
15
16 279 sheep on average (3.01% of the total). In Patagones, 53% of ranches with sheep (N=33) used night
17
18
280 enclosures to protect livestock and no one used guard animals. 42.8% (N=14) of the ranches
19
20
21 281 sheltering sheep in enclosures during the night suffered puma depredation. The ranches that utilized
22
23 282 sheep enclosures endured the mean loss of 10.5±13.1 (SD) livestock heads, which corresponded to
24
25 283 1.22% of the total, whereas those without night enclosures lost an average of 22.9±44.4 sheep
26
27 284 (6.5% of the total).
28
29
30 285 In Villarino, the control of carnivore populations was mentioned most frequently (60%) as the most
31
32 286 effective form to alleviate losses, followed by changes in livestock management (26.6%), and
33
34 287 economic compensations (13.3%) (N interviewees=14). The reduction of carnivore populations was
35
36 288 considered the most effective measure to reduce depredation (66.6%) also in Patagones (N=20),
37
38
289 followed by change of livestock management (26.6%) and monetary compensation from the
39
40
41 290 government (6.6%).
42
43 291
44
45 292 3.5 Direct inspection of kill sites
46
47 293 41.7% of the monitored ranches (N=12) suffered depredation by puma in the intensively surveyed
48
49
50 294 area, but this rate was 75% for the ranches which kept sheep only and 16.7% for those with cattle
51
52 295 only. The same skew towards sheep was observed in the numbers of depredation events and of
53
54 296 animals killed. 73.3% (N=11) of predation events were on sheep and the remaining 26.7% (N=4)
55
56 297 were on calves. If we consider all predated individuals (N=42), 90.5% were sheep and the
57
58
298 remaining 9.5% calves. Thus, puma killed 3.9% of all sheep present and 3.45 sheep and 1 calf per

3 299 event, on average. Depredation rates were 21 individuals/year and 0.08 individuals/km2. If only
4
5 300 sheep are considered, depredation rates were 3.7 sheep/year x 100km2.
6
7 301 The total economic loss caused by puma depredation during the entire period of 24 months was 2
8
9
10 302 466 USD per ranch. The loss was equivalent to 1 916 USD for the 3 ranches with sheep (or 319.3
11
12 303 USD per ranch per year) and to 550 USD for the 2 ranches that endured predation on cattle (137.5
13
14 304 USD per ranch per year). However, if we consider the 12 ranches included in this area, the mean
15
16 305 yearly loss was equivalent to 102.8 USD.
17
18
306 The intensity of depredation did not appear to be related to sheep density in this sub-area (Fig. 5).
19
20
21 307 Only one of the ranches used to enclose sheep in pens for the night. This ranch kept a herd of 300
22
23 308 sheep and recorded during the monitored a single depredation event (Fig. 5), which occurred during
24
25 309 a night when sheep were not corralled.
26
27 310 Whereas woodland was the most abundant habitat (45%) in the corrals where sheep were kept (total
28
29
30 311 area=70.6 km2), followed by grassland (27%), cropland (16.9%), and grassland with shrubs
31
32 312 (11.1%), depredation events occurred most in cropland (36.5%), followed by grassland (25.9%),
33
34 313 and grassland with shrubs (22.8%). Woodland was the least represented habitat in depredation sites
35
36 314 (14.9%). This suggests that pumas selected cropland and grassland with shrubs and avoided
37
38
315 woodlands when preying upon sheep in this area (Fig. 6).
39
40
41 316
42
43 317 The distances from depredation sites to the nearest rancher’s house ranged from 0.73 to 6.69 km
44
45 318 (average=2.89 km) and did not differ from those expected based on randomly selected points (t-test:
46
47 319 t=10.99, p>0.05). Within this range, 86.7% of depredation events occurred at more than 1 km from
48
49
50 320 the ranchers’ houses. The average distance from depredation sites was 0.64 km (range: 0-1.8 km) to
51
52 321 the nearest woodland patch and 0.14 km (range: 0-0.37 km) to the closest patch of grassland with
53
54 322 shrubs and did not differ from random points (t-test: t=0.86, p>0.05 for woodlands; t=0.84, p>0.05,
55
56 323 for grassland with shrubs).
57
58
324 As predicted, all depredation events occurred during the night time.

6
7 327 Based on the answers from interviewed ranchers, we calculated a mortality rate for each county. In
8
9
10 328 Villarino 1.56 pumas/year x 100km2 were killed while this rate was 1.1 pumas/year x 100km2 in
11
12 329 Patagones. Puma mortality rates averaged 1.36 pumas/year x 100km2 on the basis of the directly
13
14 330 confirmed mortality events (n=14) in the intensively surveyed area.

332 4. DISCUSSION
20
21 333 Livestock depredation can inflict high costs to local livelihoods, especially in poor communities (3,
22
23 334 52, 53). However, understanding carnivore-livestock conflicts requires reliable data about the actual
24
25 335 effects of depredation. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study that
26
27 336 evaluated socio-economic and ecological aspects of puma-livestock conflicts, simultaneously
28
29
30 337 quantifying large cat predation on livestock and human killing of pumas in a temperate region of
31
32 338 South America across a wide range of property sizes, livestock herd sizes, and management
33
34 339 practices. Thus, our study contributes to fill an important gap of knowledge about puma-livestock
35
36 340 conflicts in Latin America (14, 54). We found that pumas are the focal point of an intense conflict
37
38
341 with ranchers in central Argentina (see also 55) who respond by killing pumas at alarming rates.
39
40
41 342 Irrefutably, pumas caused a relatively large amount of losses and, regardless of depredation, were
42
43 343 perceived by ranchers as a major threat to their livelihoods. These results are in accordance to the
44
45 344 scarce information available on puma-livestock conflicts in southern South America. A half of the
46
47 345 165 livestock producers interviewed in the Argentinean province of Santa Cruz informed puma
48
49
50 346 predation on their stock (56). On four large sheep ranches in southern Patagonia, ranchers reported
51
52 347 annual sheep losses to pumas as 3-9% of sheep stocks and killed up to 15 pumas every year on their
53
54 348 properties (14). Similar levels of losses were reported in Chilean Patagonia, where puma killing was
55
56 349 also common (57).

3 350 Although puma depredation was widespread in our study area, affecting 35.4-46.6% of ranches in
4
5 351 the two counties, the proportions of animals killed were minimal in cattle (0.06-1%) and 3.3-10.4%
6
7 352 in sheep. Additionally, even when only the ranches affected by depredation were included, the
8
9
10 353 financial losses endured by the ranchers averaged 2 134 USD per ranch and year and were less than
11
12 354 1 000 USD in 75-76.5% of the cases. This amount is likely to represent a very large proportion of a
13
14 355 family income in some developing countries. However, as per capita Gross Domestic Product
15
16 356 (GDP) in Argentina was 10 332 USD in 2010 (58) and a great majority of the families affected by
17
18
357 predation were certainly above the average level of income for this country, we can conclude that
19
20
21 358 the damage inflicted by puma predation to regional livestock industry was economically limited..
22
23 359 Although indirect losses (e.g., abortion, weight loss, milk production decrease) linked with
24
25 360 predation were not frequently mentioned by interviewees, we did not measure them, which may
26
27 361 have led to an underestimation of the effect of puma predation on livestock. In any case, it is
28
29
30 362 important to consider that some ranchers, typically small sheep farmers from Villarino county,
31
32 363 carried a higher burden of the overall costs of depredation and experienced levels of depredation so
33
34 364 high that were likely to be economically critical. This is confirmed by the fact that some
35
36 365 interviewees, in particular individual producers that experienced multiple depredations or excessive
37
38
366 killing, abandoned sheep farming because it was no longer profitable. A similar pattern of sheep
39
40
41 367 breeding abandonment from unacceptably high scales of puma predation was previously observed
42
43 368 elsewhere (38). Because research on risk perception indicates that people focus on maximal events
44
45 369 rather than the average (59), this uneven distribution of depredation costs among ranchers may
46
47 370 unduly influence their intolerance for predators, with negative effects on carnivore conservation as
48
49
50 371 it was reported for wolves (Canis lupus; 60, 61, 62).
51
52 372 Although puma preference for sheep and goats (47, 49) is probably a major reason of unequal
53
54 373 distribution of livestock losses among ranchers, we also found a strong county-related variation in
55
56 374 this preference. In addition to the fact that puma predation was much greater than expected in
57
58
375 Villarino, we also found that both the frequency of puma attacks and the impact of depredation
59
60 13
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 14 of 35
1
2
3 376 tended to be greater in Villarino than Patagones. Consistently, recent puma hunting was more
4
5 377 pervasive and more connected to depredation levels in Villarino. A similar discrepancy in attitudes
6
7 378 towards snow leopards (Panthera uncia) between two contiguous sites in the Indian Himalaya was
8
9
10 379 attributed to differences in the economic value of livestock in these two areas (63). We argue that in
11
12 380 our study ranchers in Villarino were less tolerant basically because they experienced greater levels
13
14 381 of depredation.
15
16 382 Several studies have identified landscape variables, such as proportions of forest in proximity of
17
18
383 ranches and distances to forests and water sources, as predictors of conflicts with carnivores (27, 46,
19
20
21 384 48, 49). Although most of the predation sites we inspected were in proximity of forest patches and
22
23 385 far from houses, we failed to find any effect of distances from dense vegetation and houses on the
24
25 386 intensity of depredation by puma. However, the frequency of puma attacks was greater than
26
27 387 expected in patches of croplands and grasslands with shrubs. Because grassland with shrubs was the
28
29
30 388 habitat preferred by pumas in the same study area (18, 64), this result is in agreement with the
31
32 389 hypothesis that the distribution of puma habitat would largely explain sheep predation risk (54, 65,
33
34 390 66). Although these findings need confirmation, they suggest that failure to consider the values
35
36 391 expected on the basis of livestock use of habitat may guide to misleading conclusions on the effect
37
38
392 of habitat on predation risk.
39
40
41 393
42
43 394 4.1 Conflict mitigation
44
45 395 Although the effect of nocturnal enclosures on puma predation is contradictory (4, 34), our data
46
47 396 from interviews and kill site inspections indicate that corralling sheep at night may reduce the
48
49
50 397 extent of depredation by puma. This is not surprising given that, as expected for a region where
51
52 398 pumas are heavily hunted (5, 49), pumas have nocturnal habits and their depredation concentrated at
53
54 399 night time in our study area and that freely grazing livestock is particularly vulnerable to hunting (4,
55
56 400 7). The reduction in losses we found in ranches that used nocturnal enclosures supports the
57
58
401 conclusions of other studies in Latin America (46, 47, 49, 67) that livestock management,
59
60 14
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 15 of 35 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 402 specifically nocturnal corralling, should prove effective to alleviate depredation by puma.
4
5 403 Nevertheless, we found that only few ranchers mentioned the improvement of livestock husbandry
6
7 404 as a potentially effective tool to reduce losses, while a majority of ranchers claimed that lethal
8
9
10 405 control is the most adequate measure. Ranchers may not modify their practices to prevent predation
11
12 406 on livestock and prefer to continue hunting predators because they do not have necessary
13
14 407 knowledge, resources or readiness, or because of their negative attitude towards carnivores and
15
16 408 conservation (13, 49). Approval of killing predators is expected to increase when predators live on
17
18
409 private properties, as in our study, and when social norms or beliefs reinforce predator killing as a
19
20
21 410 societal good (24, 68, 69). In our study area, ranchers frequently mentioned depopulation of rural
22
23 411 areas as a major cause of increasing conflicts with carnivores (55). If this is the case, a more
24
25 412 widespread and efficient implementation of husbandry practices requiring greater labor may be
26
27 413 difficult because would imply large investments (70).
28
29
30 414 Our results also suggest that the levels of retaliatory and preventive killing of pumas in our study
31
32 415 area were unbalanced with respect to the real losses caused by depredation. Whereas puma killing is
33
34 416 illegal in our study area as in the rest of Buenos Aires province, since 1995 a bounty system is in
35
36 417 place to mitigate puma depredation in the neighbouring province of Rio Negro and in two
37
38
418 additional Patagonian provinces. These bounties are considerable by Argentinean economic
39
40
41 419 standards, especially for low-paid ranch workers, and up to 2 000 puma bounties have been paid per
42
43 420 year in these three provinces (14). In spite of this extremely high number of pumas killed,
44
45 421 complaints about puma predation on livestock continue and puma attacks are still considered a
46
47 422 major cause of livestock losses in Patagonia (71). Although the effect of puma control on livestock
48
49
50 423 industry has never been studied, the extent to which carnivore removal reduces predation losses
51
52 424 remains equivocal (72). Predator control is based on the assumption that a decrease in carnivore
53
54 425 abundance will result in alleviation of losses caused by predation. However, this interpretation
55
56 426 represents a simplification of the complex predator-prey dynamics and several studies have shown
57
58
427 that increasing efforts to control predator populations did not produce reductions in livestock
59
60 15

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 16 of 35

2
3 428 depredation (21, 72). Although our mortality estimates are crude and should be treated with caution,
4
5 429 they indicate that far more pumas were killed by ranchers in our study area (1.1-1.56
6
7 430 individuals/100 km2) than those legally removed by the bounty system in the Patagonian provinces
8
9
10 431 (ca. 0.3 individuals/km2; 14). It is difficult to imagine that a puma population in the rangelands of
11
12 432 central Argentina could sustain such high mortality rates over the long term. Unsuitability of most
13
14 433 habitats to pumas in this territory (18) and rarity of pumas in comparison with other carnivores (55,
15
16 434 64) support this conclusion and suggest careful monitoring of this top predator and its ecological
17
18
435 functions in central Argentina.
19
20
21 436
22
23 437 5. Conclusion
24
25 438 As most big cats, the puma is a globally iconic but locally problematic species. Livestock predation
26
27 439 by pumas is widespread across the Americas, including Chile (73), Venezuela (74), Argentina (14),
28
29
30 440 United States of America (75), Brazil (4, 76) and Mexico (7, 77) and retaliatory killing of pumas is
31
32 441 the most common response in Latin America (e.g., 14, 36, 47, 48). In the context of conflict, the
33
34 442 long-term conservation of large carnivores can only be achieved if the strategies that are developed
35
36 443 and implemented outweigh the local costs incurred (3). Thus, mitigation of conflicts between
37
38
444 humans and pumas demands for sound and reliable information on the effects of depredation (e.g.,
39
40
41 445 49, 77). The information we provided is relevant to understanding the dynamics of human-puma
42
43 446 conflicts globally and supports the development of meaningful and applicable management plans
44
45 447 for their mitigation locally.
46
47 448 In our study, puma depredation concentrated on sheep and a significant level of losses was endured
48
49
50 449 by a relatively small number of sheep ranchers, which probably shaped intolerant attitudes towards
51
52 450 pumas. Because puma depredation typically occurred at night, nocturnal corralling of sheep,
53
54 451 especially if enclosures are guarded by dogs and/or located next to inhabited houses, appears to be a
55
56 452 simple and effective measure to alleviate depredation. Although more data are needed, it is also
57
58
453 possible that livestock losses could be reduced if ranchers avoid keeping sheep in the habitats
59
60 16
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 17 of 35 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 454 locally preferred by pumas, such as grassland with shrubs. Further improvement may be obtained if
4
5 455 other measures, such as guarding dogs, financial compensations or insurance schemes are also
6
7 456 adopted, as it is unlikely that a single method will function for ranches differing largely in their
8
9
10 457 characteristics. To summarize, actively protecting sheep through an adaptive scheme based on
11
12 458 nocturnal fencing, shepherding and spatial separation between sheep and predators may be the most
13
14 459 efficient way to reduce losses. However, the process of rural areas abandonment represent a
15
16 460 potential limitation of the implementation of these measures and should be accounted for in the
17
18
461 decision making process.
19
20
21 462 Additional data are needed on the effect of natural prey availability on puma depredation rates in
22
23 463 the Americas (4, 46, 54). However, because it has been found that reduced availability of natural
24
25 464 prey may increase large cat depredation (78, 79) and that wild prey may serve to buffer livestock
26
27 465 from puma predation (80, 81), land management that facilitates a greater abundance of wild prey
28
29
30 466 may also potentially decrease depredation by pumas in the rangelands of central Argentina.
31
32 467 On the other hand, we found a poor association between the intensity of puma persecution and
33
34 468 puma-related livestock losses. Whereas it has been suggested that reduced depredation should
35
36 469 alleviate negative perceptions of large cats (e.g., 39, 45), we argue that conflict mitigation in central
37
38
470 Argentina is not only a question of reducing actual damage but also of increasing tolerance (25, 82,
39
40
41 471 83, 84, 85). Thus, in agreement with 76, 86 and 87, we conclude that the implementation of
42
43 472 awareness programs targeting local people and aiming to increase their knowledge about carnivores
44
45 473 and their role in ecosystems is important to favour long-term coexistence of pumas and ranching
46
47 474 activities in central Argentina. Finally, we surmise that strong conflicts between pumas and local
48
49
50 475 people are exacerbated by the lack of response from the government, which neither compensates
51
52 476 losses to ranchers nor offers a forum for their complaints. The success of human-puma coexistence
53
54 477 strategies will require a range of actions that are both effective and guarantee the full engagement of
55
56 478 local stakeholders in wildlife management decisions acceptable (52).

Appendix B
Dear associate editor:
Thank you so much for the comments and for the possibility of submitting a new
version of the manuscript. We have addressed all the observations made by the
reviewers and hope that we achieved an improved version that will be suitable for
publication.
Dear reviewer #1:
We have read all your suggestion and comments and we wanted to thank you for the
time dedicated to review this manuscript. We are aware that our Ms. was not easy to
follow, because of both the limitation in the database we were able to put together and
the large amount of information we provided. We hope that the improvements we made
will address your previous concerns.
- Answers to specific PDF file comments:
Line 109: We have accepted the suggestion and replaced “in almost the entire territory
of Argentina with” with “throughout Argentina”.
Line 111: We have followed your advice and changed this sentence.
Line 113: Yes, generally, in Central Argentina, landscapes converted to ranchlands were
modified by either woodland logging, shrubland degradation or substantial replacement
of native by introduced grasses for production of pasture for livestock.
Line 114: We have accepted the suggestion and replaced “pests” with “varmints”.
Line 116: Thank you for your advice. We have removed the statement “where it has
returned in recent decades”.
Line 118: corrected as suggested.
Line 122: Thank you for your suggestion. We decided to remove “These conflicts are
associated to deterioration in ecosystem dynamics”.
Line 124: We have accepted this suggestion. Thank you!
Line 135: Thank you for this great suggestion. We have replaced conflict for interaction
here and in a few other parts of the text.
Line 136: We have followed your advice and reduced the sentence.
Line 142: We have changed the sentence following your suggestion.
Line 180: Yes, we have provided the standard questionnaire in the Supplementary
material.
Line 181: We have added here a reference of a previous work where the use of this
distance was justified.
Line 195: Yes, we evaluated only corralling because the sample size of ranches using
other mitigation techniques was too small to make any significant analysis.
Line 213: We selected 15 random points because 12 was the number of predation events
recorded in this area.
Line 217: corrected as suggested.
Line 227: We have modified the sentence and also added the median values.
Line 228: Thank you for your comment. We have decided to remove it.
Line 237: We have accepted the suggestion and replaced “losses” with “loss”.
Line 244: We have added a test to support this statement.
Line 259: We have performed a residual analysis and we have decided to follow your
suggestion that the support for this regression was too small and eliminated this analysis
from the manuscript.
Line 298: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added “This cattle age class was the
only predated by pumas in this area”.
Line 300: Corrected as suggested throughout the text.
Line 308: We have re-written the sentence.
Line 310: Thank you for the suggestion, we have modified the sentence.
Line 332: Following your suggestions, we have reduced the length of the Discussion.
Line 341: We are not sure to understand properly what your concern here is. The
mortality rates were calculated per sqkm based on the size of the areas of the properties
who answered to the question “Have you killed pumas….?”. If we extrapolate to the
entire size of the study area (23630 sqkm) the total number of pumas killed would be
3191.
Line 344: corrected as suggested.
Line 350: We have split the paragraph as suggested.
Line 354: We agree and we have changed this whole section to clarify our conclusions
on this topic.
Line 358: corrected as suggested.
Line 359: Thank you for your observation. We have modified the sentence to follow
your suggestion and have added two references on human-feline conflict that mentioned
these potential indirect losses associated to livestock predation.
Line 395: corrected as suggested.
Line 397: corrected as suggested.
Line 413: corrected as suggested.
Line 437: We have shortened the conclusions following your advice.
Line 483: We have accepted the suggestion and corrected to “property”.
- Reviewer #2:
Dear Reviewer 2:
Thank you very much for the time you have invested to read this manuscript and for the
suggestions you have made. We hope that we have addressed all the concerns you
expressed and that the final product is a manuscript that will contribute to fill gap of
information about the puma-human conflict.
Form and editorial comments
1. Reference 23 has a more recent version, available to the authors upon request.
We have replaced this reference with the most recent version of this guide. Thank you
for pointing this out!
2. We recommend changing the word “cat” to “feline” in the whole manuscript.
Replaced as recommended.
3. Figure 1 in the actual PDF version is not clear; it is not possible to identify both
counties from the small illustration to the left. Maybe a very black line between both
counties would facilitate their identification allowing to cut away the left map and
making the right map bigger? I recommend eliminating the main road lines. The
“Espinal Ecoregion” in the study area presents the same pattern as the outer non-studied
area, this should be changed.
We have replaced this Figure with a new version that takes in consideration the
suggestions.
4. Caption of Figure 1 needs to be corrected (maps to map), either all in singular or all
in plural.
Corrected as suggested. Thank you.
5 Line 151: m.a.s.l. not m a.s.l.
Replaced as suggested. Thank you for detecting this mistake.
6. Lines 190 – 193: Meat price, head numbers and currency exchange rates, change
quickly, we recommend a clarification such as “at the moment of writing the
manuscript”
We have modified the sentence as suggested.
7. Lines 224-231: Can be resumed in a Table. It is important there is correspondence of
data in these paragraph and Appendix A. Values differ.
The information reported here refers exclusively to the sample of ranches that were
surveyed during our work, whereas the data showed in Appendix A has been obtained
by governmental public sources and refers to the whole study area. Following your
suggestion, we have created a new Table (Table 1) to make this clearer.
8. Line 237: Figure 2 Use bars instead of circles.
The size of the bubbles introduces a second value that we used to estimate local people
opinion on this topic, i.e. the proportion of respondents who indicated a given factor as
the most important one. The use of bars would prevent us for showing this additional
piece of information.
9. Lines 238-243: Information can be resumed in a Table.
We have followed this suggestion and placed these data in a new Table (Table 2).
10. Lines 238 – 239: Values of livestock losses in Villarino and Patagones in the text
are not the same as in Figure 2.
Sorry, but we do not understand this comment. Figure 2 quantifies respondents’
opinions on the main factors affecting predation on livestock, whereas the values
reported here refer to the number of ranchers who reported predation on their properties.
11. Line 255: Appendix C is a figure not a Table this needs to be corrected in the text.
This is not a mistake; we are citing here both a Table and Appendix C. We changed the
text to make this clear.
Part b) Patagones of the Figure “Appendix C” needs to be adjusted according to its
range (0 to 2000, not 4000).
Sorry, but we have decided not to follow your suggestion in this case because we
intentionally used the same range of values on the Y axis of both graphs, to enable
readers to make direct comparisons between counties.
12. From Line 262 on: When sample size is given, this should be with an “n” not a
capital “N”, review scientific notation.
Replaced as suggested.
13. Lines 298 – 300: Unity in notation and units. Either: individuals / year, or
individuals / km2 or individual / year / km2, but always the same in each group, as to be
able to make comparisons.
We adopted the same unit in this section to make comparisons clearer. Thanks!
14. Line 333: instead of costs – losses.
Changed as suggested.
Content comments.
1. Lines 114-115: In the Introduction, it is important not only to mention that pumas
were listed as pests for many years (Ley Nacional Nº 4863). Only in the Discussion
lines 415 – 417 is a better explanation of the legal status of Pumas in the area studied.
This should be addressed in the Introduction.
Following your comment, we have modified this section of the Introduction to clarify
the current legal status of pumas in the study area.
2. Line 115-117: The paper mentioned that pumas have returned in recent decades
however the references are from the years 2005 and 2000, given that the mentioned
references are 11 and 17 years old, are there more recent publications in relation to the
actual status of pumas in Argentina? If the answer is no, the phrasing should be
changed.
There is no recent publication on puma status in this region and to avoid confusion (also
detected by Referee #1) we have decided to omit this sentence.
3. Lines 140 – 145: In relation to the six objectives: a) depredation rate; b)
quantification of losses; c) spatial-temporal depredation patterns; d) effect of husbandry
practices; e) puma mortality rates; f) relation of depredation and puma hunting.
However, most of the information proceeds from interviews to stockowners. Experience
and many publications indicate that the depredation problems tend to be perceived as
more serious than they actually are. It is important that this is addressed in the
Introduction and in the Discussion, experience has showed that one thing is what
stakeholders perceive, another what really happens, when actual research is conducted
that does not rely on the perception of the interviewees.
We agree that ranchers may perceive depredation as more serious than it actually is and
have added a brief sentence mentioning it in the discussion. However, our direct
inspections of puma kills (though spatially limited) suggest that the figures we obtained
from interviews are reliable. Additionally, our point is that even if we assume that
perceived losses are equal to actual losses, they are truly economically relevant for a
small portion of the producers and that, in spite of that, the attitude towards puma is
generally very negative. We would have enjoyed talking more about this in the
Discussion, but we have been told that the paper is already too long…
4. Although the paper states that the areas that contain grasslands and shrubs are the
areas with the most depredations, when observing Figure 1, most of the interviews have
been maintained in the cropland area, this bias should be addressed in the Discussion
specifically in the Patagones County.
This part of our results is based on the data obtained from our direct surveys of
predation events in the smaller area (Methods, lines 202-208 ). To avoid
misunderstanding, we added a few words to clarify it at the beginning of this section of
the Results.
5. Line 176: A stratified random sampling is a method of sampling that involves the
division of a population into smaller groups known as strata. What were the inclusion
and exclusion criteria for the strata? How many strata? How were they classified?
We clarified in the new version that stratification was based on habitat. Thank you for
pointing out that this information was missing.
6. Line 179: How was the honesty of the answers evaluated? If no control questions
were applied it is not possible to evaluate how honest the answers were. This needs to
be addressed.
The honesty of the answers was not assessed, because this is not very easy to do.
However, we stated at the beginning of our interviews with local people that we did not
work for the any governmental agency and that the identity of interviewees was not
going to be used. Additionally, the semi-structured format of the interview enabled us to
spend enough time with the ranchers we interviewed to notice that they were becoming
more and more confident. Finally, no one appears to be afraid to mention their
perception and attitudes towards carnivores in our study area, because there is
absolutely no enforcement of the law prohibiting puma killing and most hunting takes
place in private property where police has no access. Because of all that, if a bias was
introduced, we are confident that it would be an underestimation of pumas killed, which
would reinforce our conclusive concern on the urgency of finding ways to mitigate
conflicts in this region.
Anyway, we have modified slightly this part of the text in order to address your
comment.
7. Lines 204 – 205: How do authors know that the number of cattle heads was larger
than the number of sheep? It is possible to review records of the agriculture and
secretaries etc. to have approximate number of cattle for the area; otherwise any
numerical assumption is invalid.
We did not have the exact number of cattle, but it was greater than 2000. We changed
this sentence to state it.
8. Line 209 and on: It is important to characterize the environmental conditions in
which depredation occurs. However, depredation tends to happen in the places were the
prey is available, the question arises as to where the sheep are kept. Are sheep kept in
woodlands? If the answer is no, then, the only conclusion the Jacobs index provides is
that there is internal validity, since the test corroborated that there was no sheep
predation in woodlands b/s no sheep were kept in woodlands. This needs to be
addressed.
As reported later in the Results, woodland formed part of the corrals where sheep were
kept. In general, we totally agree that the information on both the habitat where sheep
are kept and the habitat available in the area needs to be considered to conclude whether
predation rates are affected by environmental variables and in fact this is what we did in
our analyses. We also felt necessary to stress this point in our Discussion, because many
papers state that proximity to a given habitat favors predation when this may simply be
because livestock is always in proximity of that habitat in that particular study area.
9. Lines 244 – 246: …Puma predation was greater than expected…” What values were
expected? How were the expectations calculated? Based on what?
We have added a sentence in the Methods to explain how we carried out this simple
analysis. We have also added a test showing the significativity of these differences.
10. Line 249 and on: All result expressed in % should have an “n” (sample size)
available.
We have added these values as requested.
11. Means and medians: Given that most data presented in this manuscript do not seem
to have a normal distribution, a better measure of centrality should be the median,
especially considering the incredible large SD. CI as a measure of the dispersion of the
distribution is more appropriate especially when comparisons between different sets are
made.
We replaced (or added) the Mean values reported for the corresponding Medians as
requested. However, we have not replaced the SD for CI because in many cases we also
report the whole range of values.
12. Figure 4, Line 259: How were the “odds of predation” calculated? Or, do the
authors mean the log transformed number of predation events? This needs to be
addressed because it is not the same. Given that the relationship between odds of
predation and number of stock is extremely weak, authors should consider if this
analysis is adequate. There is no residual vs. fit plot or explanation, which would allow
to identify if the assumption of a relationship is reasonable (linear); if the data form a
relatively horizontal line around 0 suggesting that the variance of the error terms are
equal; and above all that no residual stands out, suggesting outliers, which will probably
not be the case, considering some extremely scattered data points.
We have considered your suggestion and after performing a residual analysis we have
decided to eliminate this analysis from the manuscript.
13. Line 297: Define age in months of the calves; it is not the same a calf of 5 months
than a calf of 1 month, these differences are important.
We have added some information in the text of the new version to address this
comment.
14. Line 307: Specify which ranch (B?)
Corrected. Thanks!
15. Lines 314 – 315: It is important to clarify if sheep are kept in woodlands, if not this
should be addressed in the manuscript.
As we state in the text, woodland was present in the corrals where sheep were kept and
it was thus available to sheep for use. We do not have data on sheep movements that
may clarify how much time they spent in each habitat but this goes beyond the scope of
this Ms. See also our response to comment #8.
16. Line 340 – 341: It seems logical that pumas are the focal point of conflict, given the
scarcity or total eradication of other large carnivores.
This is not necessarily the case. Conflict may not occur if the conditions were different.
In any case, we changed the sentence to stress the intensity of this conflict and introduce
the following conclusions.
17. Lines 359 – 360: Why are abortions, weight loss and milk production decrease
linked to predation events? Is this a statement of the interviewees, or an argument of the
authors? What is the conceptualization behind this link? Where is the reference? This
needs to be addressed.
This whole paragraph has been changed to improve it also in response to Referee #1
comments. Two references have also been added to support the hypothesis that these
can be indirect effects of depredation.
18. Lines 403 – 405. One of the most important points presented in this study is that
nocturnal corralling not always functioned as a management strategy to decrease
predation. Indeed, sometimes it encourages surplus killing, producing huge losses to
stockowners. Experience (and literature support) indicates that it is one of the most
efficient measures to control predation, especially in young sheep and calves. However,
the big difference in corralling is, that they are usually designed to keep stock “inside”
and not predators “outside”. The corrals were probably not designed to keep the
predators out (maybe ranch B), but the stock in; which is one of the most common
mistakes made when using corrals. This needs to be addressed in the Discussion. Do the
authors have data to corroborate the intention and function of the corrals? If not, then
the doubt will prevail as to what kind of corrals were used. Although the prevailing
attitude along the range of large felines is “the good feline, is the dead feline”, maybe
the reason why the majority of ranchers claimed that lethal control is the most adequate
measure, is that the available solutions are lacking. Sheepdogs, Fladry fencing, bells,
bells with lights and predator proved corrals have showed remarkably good results,
especially with Pumas.
Thank you very much for these thoughtful comments. Although we have been asked by
Referee # 1 to shorten the Discussion, we agree with you that poor corral design may be
an additional reason why they do not work and we mentioned it in the new version of
this section.
