Synopsis:
This article explores a recently introduced network measure named General Erdos Number
(GEN). A GEN is a measure the closeness of one node in a network with respect to another.
Although the concept was introduced in another article (already published) the authors fully
introduce the concept before considering various questions one might want to know regarding
how well they measure a complex network. Specifically they consider the frequency distribution
(over all pairs) of GENs for two standard network models (ER and BA networks), they compare
the GEN to mean first passage time of a random walk and the time to infection of a simple model
of epidemic spreading, they compare GENs of node pairs within the same network module to
those between modules, they compare two centrality measures based on GENs to a range of
established centrality measures, and finally consider the GENs of various node pairs within an
infinite network embedded in a finite sphere.
As far I am aware, all of the established measures of this kind that aim to quantify the closeness
of one node from another in a network fall into one of two categories: those that are walk-based
(e.g. shortest path) and those that are diffusion-based (e.g. communicability). Walk based
measures correspond to the example of a book being passed around from individual to another,
diffusion based measures correspond to the example of an online article being shared via email.
3
Both require network contacts but the relative likelihood that the book/article will reach one
individual having been introduced to the network from another is different in both cases.
The interesting thing about GENs is that they combine elements from both these types of process
and could therefore potentially explore the topology of networks in a unique way. In some
applications, for example product recommendation using co-purchase networks, it is not entirely
clear whether a walk-based or diffusion based measure of closeness performs better, or even if
they produce different results at all. This, to me, is a good motivation for applying GENs to a
range of network topologies and seeing how they relate to various dynamical processes occurring
on these networks.
My main reason for not accepting this work is that it does not meet quality of RSOS articles in
regards to framing the questions that their analysis answers. However, edited in the right way I
believe that this article could be brought to a suitable standard for publication. The article fails to
meet the following two criteria listed in the RSOS instructions for reviewers:
- Writing style and accessibility for a wide audience.
- Appropriate length – whilst Royal Society Open Science operates without page limits, we
encourage authors to be concise. Each article should be of the shortest length required to contain
all useful and relevant information, and no longer.
Both these criteria could be met if the authors are able to construct a clear narrative for their
paper, define some specific aims of their analysis in the introduction, remove any sections that do
not contribute to these aims, then finally write a conclusion that addresses the initial goal of the
study. In its current form the paper presents a list of unrelated and unimportant facts about a
measure of closeness on a network. I would like to see the following broad questions addressed
in some way: What was the motivation for doing this work? Are there any real-world
applications where this would be particularly useful (i.e. an improvement on measures that are
already out there)? What have we learned about complex networks that we didn't previously
already know? etc.
I will now list specific points about the manuscript section by section.
Section 2:
I downloaded the code and attempted to run the example. I am running Ubuntu 16.04 on a

Please can you help me (and others) to implement your code more easily.
Typo on page 5: "a measure of centrality [that] does not suffer"
Section 3:
It is not clear what the purpose of this section is. The end result seems to only be an inaccurate
estimate of the mean of Ed and Ec. I think the majority of this analysis should be removed or, at
the very least, moved to an appendix or supplementary section. The mathematics is very hard to
follow and this will alienate most of the readers. For those who do want to follow the
mathematics, all of the details of how each equation was derived should be provided.
I am not comfortable with your use of "~". Usually it describes a scaling relationship but it seems
like you are treating it like "=" and substituting it into other equations. Please explain these
substitutions in more detail or remove these sections.
On page 6 "the average closeness" - replace with "mean" or whatever average was calculated.
Typo on page 7 "there is a we can"
Typo on page 7 "nodes is"
Page 7 "Substitution into eq 3.6" substitution of what?
Page 7 - what does xi represent (the greek letter)?
Figure 2 caption - "predicted average" - can you please refer to the formula that makes this
prediction (I could not find it). Also on page 9 "peaks are well predicted".
Figure 2 - Why not also show the empirical data used in section 8?
Page 9 "appear to have a relatively fat tail" - relative to what?
Page 10 - it is stated that the distributions are different between the two network topologies only
when you look at connected nodes. Is this possibly due to the abundance of node pairs in the BA
model that contain a node of degree 1 connected to a node with very high degree? it seems that
this motif (like figure 1B) would produce GENs that are lower than those found in the ER model.
Section 4:
5
Figure 5 - What are the color bars to the right of each figure?
Figure 5 - Label of horizontal axis should be a small delta
Page 11 - How was the empirical scaling formula found?
Page 11 "alpha~4" doesn't make sense. Do you mean alpha=4?
Page 11 Why is the relationship between delta tau and delta E affected by the network size?
Page 11 "It is visually apparent that k sets the scale" I disagree - the figures are plotted on
different scale axes so it is not clear.
Section 5:
page 12 "when individuals interact" please detail when these interactions happen
Figure 7E - values on the x axis do not agree with what is in the text. Also, why does it say "lower
is better" on the y axis?
Figure 7 - Typo in caption line 6 - R should be r
Figure 7E - The inclusion of resistance distance makes this figure a little confusing (since it is
barely mentioned in the text)
Page 13 - "each node having k=4 average degree" is the degree of every node the same?
Page 13 - "Because GENs do not naturally include the timescales of the system dynamics we
normalize the harmonic mean by ..." Why is this the motivation? If you use the same rates in all of
the simulations then the normalization is not needed. What happens if you plot the values of hij
without the normalization? If you see a trend then I think you should abandon the normalization
and focus on this instead. If not, then it must be the case that Hi is dominating the trend you see
in figure 7, then you must change your conclusions.
I suspect that Hi is dominating the outcomes we see here, or another way to see it, the degree, ki,
is confounding the relationship between Ei and Hi. For example suppose we have a network
where i is connected to ki nodes and j is connected to one of those (but not connected to i directly)
then hij is not affected by ki, Eij increases as you increase ki, and Hi decreases. Although this
example isn't directly related to the ER topology it does show that it is possible for hij to be
insignificant while Hi is affecting the relationship.
Page 14 Ti not defined in main text (only in caption of figure 7)
Page 14 "does a surprisingly poor job of predicting the infection time" I don't see how you have
concluded this from Figure 7. Can you quantify it?
Page 14 - Please define "residual"
Page 14 " quantified using the standard deviation of the residuals" - what are we supposed to
conclude from this? I thought that the quality of the fit would be the total of the residuals not
their variance. All residuals could be high but their standard deviation low.
6
Page 14 - "The insets of Fig ... nearby values of tau/T." I do not understand the meaning of this
sentence.
Page 14 "parameters in Fig 6" should be Fig 7?
I think an interesting application of GENs could be in a slightly more realistic disease model. The
one you used is very much like a diffusion process so the "finite resource" element to GENs does
not represent anything in this process. In reality, however, time and social effort are finite
resources so that element ought to exist in more realistic disease models (yet it is still a diffusive
process). I wonder if real infectious diseases are most accurately described by dynamics
consistent with GENs.
Section 6:
Page 14 " a valid expansion for ki=k ... " this sentence seems to be unnecessary and I couldn't find
the SI that is referred to.
Page 14 in the formula on the second-to-last line there is a j which should be an l
Page 15 - the curly p symbol needs its own introduction - why is it different from Psi?
Typo on page 15 "Inn"
Figure 9A - the LFR parameters do not need to be in the legend (in my opinion), include them in
the main text instead.
Page 16 "eq 6.1 can be written ..." this formula has mistakes: It is only true in the case where Cj is
the set of all the nodes (this should be made clear, I don't think it is a problem since it is a
weighted network and weights can be 0), the second term on the right hand side should be
wjj*pij, "is readily inverted" this is not obvious unless you say that the second term on the right
hand side is equal to 0. Please clarify this whole section.
I recommend removing the parts about linearized importance. It is difficult to see the purpose of
this section.
Page 16 "... that do not share a direct connection ..." what about those that do? I think it is an
interesting question to ask whether neighbors in the same community are more or less important
than those in other communities.
Page 16 last sentence of section 6 - What is this telling us beyond what we know from previous
sections? what are the significance of n and w? The example used is quite complicated and I feel
that a more basic example could have a stronger message i.e. does increased community structure
make nodes more topologically close or less topologically close?
Section 7:
Page 16 "Each measure ranks high degree nodes above low degree nodes" that is not true -
betweenness, for example can place very low degree nodes at the top in some networks.
Table 1 - This table is not useful, the definitions are too brief, contain errors, and are also
unnecessary since references are provided. Please include these references in the main text.
Page 17 "is consistent with other measures of centrality" in what way?
7
Page 17 "sharp drop initially" I do not see a sharp drop in figure 10C or 10A.
Page 17 "begins to agree agree better with betweenness centrality" I think this is a false statement,
please clarify.
Page 17 "compares best to the list from random walk centrality" Why do you think that is the
case?
Section 8:
Typo on page 17: "importance assigned [to] nodes"
Figure 10A why no show all the centrality measures i.e. non-backtracking and degree?
Page 18 "the leading eigenvalue of the matrix" I think you mean to say "the i’th element of the
eigenvector that corresponds to the leading eigenvalue?"
Page 18 "a walker at node j moves preferentially" - this is only correct if Eij is smaller for directly
connected nodes than it is for indirectly connected nodes.
Figure 11 needs a legend. Also why not combine this with the results from the ER graph and
Figure 12 to make a 3 panel figure.
Page 19 - please consistently refer to gi as "importance eigenvector centrality". "eigenvector
centrality" alone is not specific enough and "eigenvalue centrality" is incorrect.
Page 19 "we converted the network" why?
Page 19 why do you report results for g²? the same results should be true for g, no? Unless there
is a good reason, please use g instead of g²
Page 19 "and therefore with ..." missing parenthesis. Also, is it well known that PageRank is
proportional to degree as you state? Please provide a reference of a reason for saying this.
Page 19 "A walker teleporting between nodes retains information about that nodes importance in
the network" this seems incorrect although I am not sure I understand what you are trying to say
here. Please clarify.
Page 19 "for the standard PageRank" what value of gamma have you used in these calculations
Page 19 "Surprisingly, this indicates a near perfect fit of the importance eigenvector centrality"
Another interpretation is that the GEN for connected pairs is so much lower than those for non-
connected pairs that no "teleports" ever happen and importance eigenvector centrality is
effectively the same as PageRank with gamma=0.
Section 9:
I recommend removing this entire section. It adds a lot of length to the paper without coming to
any satisfying conclusion. The results are also based on an assumption that is not validated (page
29 above Eq A3)
Page 20 - when introducing yi please tell us what it is. A vector? A point in n-dimensional space?
How should we visualize it?
8
Page 20 "we also define a network of 'material nodes' into the network" this does not make
grammatical sense. You cannot define something into something else.
Page 20 "reference to Eq.1" What is Eq 1?
Typo on page 22 "Solution to the equation 9.1 is ..."
Conclusions:
Page 24 - The second paragraph of the conclusions section seems to confuse epidemic spreading
with eigenvector centrality and PageRank. The remainder of the conclusions section talks about
computational costs and is therefore not a conclusion.
Section A:
Typo on page 28 "between material the nodes"
Page 28 "We have kept the continuum version of ..." Not clear what you are referring to here
Section B:
Typo on Page 28, very last line "xvj"
Page 29 - Second term on LHS of A2 numerator should be u²
Page 29 - "If we assume that" The condition that you want to assume is determined by other
factors - either show that it is the case, or define the network in such a way that ensures that it is
the case.
General comments:
I think it is a bad idea to use th word "feel" since in some applications such as human and animal
social networks the nodes actually do have feelings of closeness that would be unrelated to their
topological closeness. I recommend that you replace all instances of "feel" with something like
"are topologically close"
Many of the paragraphs are too long and should be broken into smaller pieces.
I hope you agree with my recommendations and wish you a trouble-free time in making the
appropriate changes!

in figure 7, then you must change your conclusions.
I suspect that Hi is dominating the outcomes we see here, or another way to see it, the degree, ki,
is confounding the relationship between Ei and Hi. For example suppose we have a network
where i is connected to ki nodes and j is connected to one of those (but not connected to i directly)
then hij is not affected by ki, Eij increases as you increase ki, and Hi decreases. Although this
example isn't directly related to the ER topology it does show that it is possible for hij to be
insignificant while Hi is affecting the relationship.
Page 14 Ti not defined in main text (only in caption of figure 7)
Page 14 "does a surprisingly poor job of predicting the infection time" I don't see how you have
concluded this from Figure 7. Can you quantify it?
Page 14 - Please define "residual"
Page 14 " quantified using the standard deviation of the residuals" - what are we supposed to
conclude from this? I thought that the quality of the fit would be the total of the residuals not
their variance. All residuals could be high but their standard deviation low.
Page 14 - "The insets of Fig ... nearby values of tau/T." I do not understand the meaning of this
sentence.
Page 14 "parameters in Fig 6" should be Fig 7?
I think an interesting application of GENs could be in a slightly more realistic disease model. The
one you used is very much like a diffusion process so the "finite resource" element to GENs does
not represent anything in this process. In reality, however, time and social effort are finite
resources so that element ought to exist in more realistic disease models (yet it is still a diffusive
process). I wonder if real infectious diseases are most accurately described by dynamics
consistent with GENs.
Section 6:
Page 14 " a valid expansion for ki=k ... " this sentence seems to be unnecessary and I couldn't find
the SI that is referred to.
Page 14 in the formula on the second-to-last line there is a j which should be an l
Page 15 - the curly p symbol needs its own introduction - why is it different from Psi?
Typo on page 15 "Inn"
Figure 9A - the LFR parameters do not need to be in the legend (in my opinion), include them in
the main text instead.
Page 16 "eq 6.1 can be written ..." this formula has mistakes: It is only true in the case where Cj is
the set of all the nodes (this should be made clear, I don't think it is a problem since it is a
weighted network and weights can be 0), the second term on the right hand side should be
wjj*pij, "is readily inverted" this is not obvious unless you say that the second term on the right
hand side is equal to 0. Please clarify this whole section.
15
I recommend removing the parts about linearized importance. It is difficult to see the purpose of
this section.
Page 16 "... that do not share a direct connection ..." what about those that do? I think it is an
interesting question to ask whether neighbors in the same community are more or less important
than those in other communities.
Page 16 last sentence of section 6 - What is this telling us beyond what we know from previous
sections? what are the significance of n and w? The example used is quite complicated and I feel
that a more basic example could have a stronger message i.e. does increased community structure
make nodes more topologically close or less topologically close?
Section 7:
Page 16 "Each measure ranks high degree nodes above low degree nodes" that is not true -
betweenness, for example can place very low degree nodes at the top in some networks.
Table 1 - This table is not useful, the definitions are too brief, contain errors, and are also
unnecessary since references are provided. Please include these references in the main text.
Page 17 "is consistent with other measures of centrality" in what way?
Page 17 "sharp drop initially" I do not see a sharp drop in figure 10C or 10A.
Page 17 "begins to agree agree better with betweenness centrality" I think this is a false statement,
please clarify.
Page 17 "compares best to the list from random walk centrality" Why do you think that is the
case?
Section 8:
Typo on page 17: "importance assigned [to] nodes"
Figure 10A why no show all the centrality measures i.e. non-backtracking and degree?
Page 18 "the leading eigenvalue of the matrix" I think you mean to say "the i’th element of the
eigenvector that corresponds to the leading eigenvalue?"
Page 18 "a walker at node j moves preferentially" - this is only correct if Eij is smaller for directly
connected nodes than it is for indirectly connected nodes.
Figure 11 needs a legend. Also why not combine this with the results from the ER graph and
Figure 12 to make a 3 panel figure.
Page 19 - please consistently refer to gi as "importance eigenvector centrality". "eigenvector
centrality" alone is not specific enough and "eigenvalue centrality" is incorrect.
Page 19 "we converted the network" why?
Page 19 why do you report results for g²? the same results should be true for g, no? Unless there
is a good reason, please use g instead of g²
16
Page 19 "and therefore with ..." missing parenthesis. Also, is it well known that PageRank is
proportional to degree as you state? Please provide a reference of a reason for saying this.
Page 19 "A walker teleporting between nodes retains information about that nodes importance in
the network" this seems incorrect although I am not sure I understand what you are trying to say
here. Please clarify.
Page 19 "for the standard PageRank" what value of gamma have you used in these calculations
Page 19 "Surprisingly, this indicates a near perfect fit of the importance eigenvector centrality"
Another interpretation is that the GEN for connected pairs is so much lower than those for non-
connected pairs that no "teleports" ever happen and importance eigenvector centrality is
effectively the same as PageRank with gamma=0.
Section 9:
I recommend removing this entire section. It adds a lot of length to the paper without coming to
any satisfying conclusion. The results are also based on an assumption that is not validated (page
29 above Eq A3)
Page 20 - when introducing yi please tell us what it is. A vector? A point in n-dimensional space?
How should we visualize it?
Page 20 "we also define a network of 'material nodes' into the network" this does not make
grammatical sense. You cannot define something into something else.
Page 20 "reference to Eq.1" What is Eq 1?
Typo on page 22 "Solution to the equation 9.1 is ..."
Conclusions:
Page 24 - The second paragraph of the conclusions section seems to confuse epidemic spreading
with eigenvector centrality and PageRank. The remainder of the conclusions section talks about
computational costs and is therefore not a conclusion.
Section A:
Typo on page 28 "between material the nodes"
Page 28 "We have kept the continuum version of ..." Not clear what you are referring to here
Section B:
Typo on Page 28, very last line "xvj"
Page 29 - Second term on LHS of A2 numerator should be u²
Page 29 - "If we assume that" The condition that you want to assume is determined by other
factors - either show that it is the case, or define the network in such a way that ensures that it is
the case.
General comments:
I think it is a bad idea to use th word "feel" since in some applications such as human and animal
social networks the nodes actually do have feelings of closeness that would be unrelated to their
17
topological closeness. I recommend that you replace all instances of "feel" with something like
"are topologically close"
Many of the paragraphs are too long and should be broken into smaller pieces.
I hope you agree with my recommendations and wish you a trouble-free time in making the
appropriate changes!

I think that this is a valuable contribution to the field of network analysis and vertex centrality
measures, useful for practitioners. Please correct few minor points given below.
Abstract, Page 2 Line 38, should read '...to new methods to measure centrality." The last sentence
in abstract does not make sense, maybe "We demonstrate the utility of this measure of
topological proximity by showing that..."
Page 3 Line 29 toward the end, it should be 'its degree'.
Page 6 Eq 2.1 In the current format, the second summand on the right hand side is not defined for
w_{jl}=0, it contains 1/w_{jl}, therefore you need to specify that the sum is over the connected
vertices only.

Comments to the Author:

The manuscript by Morrison et al., entitled ‘Generalised Erdo<U+030B>s numbers for
network analysis’ investigates the use of the so-called generalised Erdo<U+030B>s numbers
as a measure of network centrality. More specifically, the paper is interested in
the problem of ranking nodes in the case were resources are finite, which is a less
well-studied area of network science, in relation to general centrality measures
at least. It starts by considering some analytical results that can be derived for
certain specialised network models, before considering a number of applications,
including the important topic of epidemic spreading. I thought the work was
interesting, novel and extremely well written, and I believe it will appeal to a
wide audience given its mixture of theory and experiment. I am therefore very
happy to support its publication, subject to the following minor corrections.
Minor Comments:
1. The figures are in general a little too small and so quite difficult to make
out; this is particularly problematic for figure legends, axis labels, etc. as
the font size is tiny.
2. The sentence on page 4 starting on line 17 is missing a word: ‘We de-
termine the distribution of the GENs for homogeneous (Erdo<U+030B>s-Renyi) and
inhomogeneous (Baraba´si-Albert) networks and show...’
3. The sentence on page 24 starting at line 36 is incomplete/nonsensical: ‘The
ability of ... importance or centrality’
