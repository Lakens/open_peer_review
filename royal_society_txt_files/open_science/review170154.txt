The authors studied a dataset of online activity on the Twitter micro-blogging platform, focusing
on users creating and sharing content regarding the Irish Marriage Referendum of 2015. As the
authors point out, the study can be of interest for other online social media related studies (e.g.
the diffusion of information and opinion dynamics) and for the calibration of polling data. I agree
with their conclusion and I think the article should be published after some minor revisions,
thank to its technical soundness.
In order to increase the readability of the work, I think some points should be addressed:
- Section 4: The work starts with a quite large sample of users (about 1.5*10^5) and then proceeds
to built two networks (mention and follower) in which the interaction is reciprocal. This
considerably reduce the sample by two orders of magnitude. Despite the fact there are references
to other works justifying this procedure, I think such reduction deserves a little bit more of
explanation about the effects of non-reciprocal interactions.
- In Section 4a I understand that the weights of the links in the mention network are the
aggregations of the sentiment score of the mentions, but it is not clear to me what is the weight of
the links in the follower network. Is it the aggregation of the sentiment scores of all the
interactions between the users (not only the mentions)?
- Section 6: In this section the authors define a method for the classification of users based on
network community detection and sentiment analysis. From this picture emerged that users can
be classified according to their relationships and to their opinion towards the referendum. I
thinks some minor information about the sizes of the initial partitions of the mention and
follower networks should be given in this section.
- Figure 6: The size of the labels should be increased (especially in panels e and f). 7
- Table 3: from the sampling over the CC1, CC2 and CC3 clusters emerges that the fraction of
users biased towards No is 26/358, which is considerably smaller than the percentage of No
voters at the referendum. Hence, is this under-representation due to the final choice of 2047 users
due to the construction of the two networks or is it intrinsic of the twitter platform (i.e. it would
be almost the same with the whole initial sample)? Please discuss the existence of possible biases
in the data and eventually how they might affect the findings.
Once these points have been addressed, I agree for the publication of this work.

In this work authors show how a network theory approach in combination with sentiment
analysis can be used for the analysis preference alignments in Twitter community. They
demonstrate their approach by analyzing the twitter community engaged in the discussion about
Ireland referendum on same-sex marriages. The method demonstrated in this work is very
interesting and can be widely applied for studying different types of discussion communities in
cyberspace. There are several, minor, issues that authors should address.
Although, this is an interesting choice of the subset of twitter data, the conclusion of the paper is
not directly related to Ireland referendum. This could leave the potential reader with the question
about the choice of the data. I think authors should explain this in the Introduction section of the
paper.
Authors explain how they constructed two type of networks, mention and follower network, and
then they give a very brief (one sentence description of the network structural properties).
Although I do not criticize the presented numbers regarding the average degree and transitivity
coefficient, I have to point out that these numbers do not tell much about the network structure.
Specifically, both of these networks are (probably) highly heterogeneous when it comes to degree,
meaning that average value does not carry any relevant information. Furthermore, both networks
are directed, thus it is not clear how authors calculated the transitivity coefficient in these
networks. Please describe the network structure in the proper way.
On the page 7, authors say “Figure 3 shows that users tend to have approximately the same
average in- and out-sentiment.”, but the Figure 3 only shows the distribution of average user out
(a) and in (b) sentiment, and does not indicate any correlation between user's out and in
sentiment. Please, rephrase this sentence. In the same paragraph: the average sentiment scores
can be centered around not “about” zero.
In the next paragraph, please correct the phrase “tweet is not itself is not entirely reliable”.

Page 7 row 3: "Figure 3 shows..." currently misleading, it shows distributions. Also, in line 55 only
neighbour sentiment in looks symmetric.

Page 9 caption of Figure 5: 'red squares' should be 'red triangles'
Page 13 line 52: '24% and 26%' should be '23% and 26%' (summing up the values from the table
gives 23 not 24), line 53 is misleading should be reformulated to "the largest percentage of tweets
between the Active Yes and Active No corresponds to replies" as given percentages are overall

1. Introduction 2
The Republic of Ireland held a referendum to legalise same-sex marriage on the 22 of May 2015.
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
This referendum saw a high turnout (60.52% of voters), and the final result was a 62% majority
in favour of the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Such high turnout represented a dramatic
increase compared to previous referenda [1]. The enthusiasm of the electorate was reflected in the
activity of on-line social media platforms, particularly on Twitter::::::Twitter,:which saw a wealth of
activity in the days preceding the referendum [2].
Twitter is an online micro-blogging platform where users can post short messages or tweets
that can be up to 140 characters long; in Ireland, an estimated 25% of adults have a Twitter
account, of which 36% use the service every day [3]. Users can subscribe to other users’ tweets
(or follow); such following relationships are often asymmetric, :: :if one user follows another, a
..............................................................
reciprocated following relationship does not always exist [4]. In addition to following each other,
there are other ways in which users can publicly interact such as re-tweeting (passing forward
another user’s tweet), and mentioning each other in tweets. Twitter has been a popular venue
for the dissemination of information, memes, opinions, and has facilitated public debate about a
[4–11]. As a result, Twitter has received considerable attention from
variety of subjects [4–7,9–11]:::::
researchers who wish to gain insights into the relationships and mechanisms that govern these
social interactions [12].
The use of sentiment analysis to infer the disposition of individuals or groups towards
specific topics is a growing area of interest in computational social science [12–17]. For example,
sentiment analysis on Twitter data has been used to study stock market fluctuations [18,19],
film box-office performance [20] and reviews [21], tracking the spread of influenza [22], and
(albeit controversially) predicting elections [10,23–26]. Although some of these studies have well-
noted shortcomings [27,28], the idea of using the content of tweets to gain insight into social
phenomena remains a promising and compelling one. Recent studies, using carefully constructed
methodologies, have successfully leveraged sentiment to uncover insights into its effect on the
spreading of cascades on Twitter [9], and how top broadcasters send messages with positive
sentiment more often than negative [29].
The amount of Twitter activity during the Irish Marriage Referendum thus provides an
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
excellent opportunity to understand how users interact around controversial or polarising topics.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
A feature of the referendum which facilitates its analysis is that it posed a clear yes/no question
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
compared to other, more complex consultations where voters must rank a range of options (e.g.,
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
general elections in Ireland). Furthermore, the perceived polarising nature of the referendum can
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
lead to easily distinguishable camps supporting voting yes or no, which is more tractable than,
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
for example, attempting to assign members of the electorate to a political party in the presence of
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
many similar political
::::::::::::::::::::::::
groups. In this work we combine analyses of sentiment and social structure
to explore Twitter conversations about the Irish marriage referendum. In particular, we address
the following questions:
• How did ::::::
Twitter :users interact with each other on Twitter in the context of the Irish
Marriage Referendum?
• Can user interactions and the sentiment of their tweets help us find supporters of voting
yes (in favour of the legalisation of same-sex marriage) and no (against it)?
To answer these questions, we analyse an extensive dataset of tweets about the referendum, and
the interactions among the users who posted the tweets (Sec. 2). We extract a sentiment score for
each tweet (Sec. 3), and incorporate it into the structure of the mention and follower networks
of users (Sec. 4). These networks enable the analysis of how the sentiment of users is correlated,
and the proclivity of users with positive/negative sentiment to cluster together (Sec. 5). We use
community detection to partition the users in the mention and follower networks into groups who
communicate more or are generally more interested in each other’s content. We examine these

communities from the vantage point of sentiment analysis to find a parsimonious three-group
partition of the users (Sec. 6). These three groups are broadly composed of yes and no supporters
with varying levels of activity, and starkly different patterns of interaction with each other (Sec. 7).
Finally, in Sec. 8 we discuss our results and explore potential future research directions.
2. Data
The dataset we use analyse
::::::
in this work consists of every tweet containing the hashtags #marref
and #marriageref from May 8 to May 23 2015 (one day after the referendum). In total
we collected 499,642 tweets posted by 144,007 unique users (see Fig. 1(a)). A total of 204,626
tweets were posted before the referendum day; 88,320 on the day; and 206,696 after. The peaks
observed in Fig. 1(a) coincide with the first and second televised debates (held on May 11 and
May 19) and the referendum day (May 22), the tallying and announcement of the results, and
subsequent global reaction. Figure 1(b) shows that the number of tweets per user has a heavy
tailed distribution. The vast majority of users only posted a small number of tweets with the
tracked hashtags, while a small number of users are responsible for a large volume of tweets. Of
the total number of tweets, 135,370 (27%) were original, 24,397 (5%) were replies and 339,875 (68%)
were retweets. Broadly speaking, original tweets are messages that are not in response to another
previously posted tweet (i.e., the content is ‘new’), replies are tweets that are posted in response
to an existing original tweet, and retweets are tweets written by others that a user passes along
Users can mention each other in their tweets by inserting
to his/her followers. In addition users :::::
a user’s screen name (technically, replies and retweets can be seen as specific types of mention
tweets). In our data there are 388,161 mention tweets (78% of all tweets), of which 25,732 are
original, 23,131 are replies, and 339,298 are retweets. In addition to tweets, we also obtained the
follower relationships of all users who tweeted used at least one of the hashtags in our data (i.e.,
::::::::::
a list of everyone who is followed by the authors of the tweets in our data, regardless of whether
they used the tracked hashtags). These correspond to 117,669,550 follower links. We also collected
user information such as self-defined location, self-description and how long the user has been a
member of Twitter.

and all user following relationships we are able to circumvent such sampling issues. There could
be, however, other issues with the data. For example, it is possible that our data gathering could
miss important tweets or individuals if they never tweeted using one of the tracked hashtags.
However, due to the ubiquity of the hashtags #marref and #marriageref in the weeks leading
up to the referendum we are confident that our data is an adequate representation of the Twitter
discourse about the topic.
3. Sentiment of tweets
To quantify how::: emotions of
the positive or negative a tweet is, we need to compute the tweet’s :::::::: :::
a
tweet, we compute
::::::::::::::::::
its sentiment score. We do not consider sentiment with the categorical positive
or negative labels; instead we consider sentiment to be a number whose magnitude denotes how
positive or negative the language expressed is [32]. For this task we use the open source sentiment
algorithm SentiStrength, a lexicon-based sentiment algorithm that searches for words that have an
associated positive or negative score [33]. SentiStrength provides a score of both the positive and
the negative emotional charge of a string of text (in this case, of each tweet in our data). Positive
scores range from 1 to 5, and negative scores from -1 to -5. A score of 1 (or -1) indicates that the
tweet has no positive (or negative sentiment), while a score of 5 (or -5) means that the tweet has
the most:::::::::
maximum positive (negative) score possible. See Appendix A for more details on how
sentiment scores are obtained with SentiStrength.
Figure 2(a) shows the two dimensional distribution of sentiment scores of all the tweets in
our dataset. To simplify calculations we compute the difference between the add the positive and
::::::
negative scores of each tweet to obtain a one dimensional score between -4 and 4. A negative
score indicates that the tweet contains stronger negative language than positive, and vice versa
for positive scores. Figure 2(b) shows the distribution of the unidimensional sentiment scores of
all tweets in the dataset. About half of all tweets (55%) have a score of zero; of these the vast
majority (95%) have a score of 1 and -1 for positive and negative language, respectively (i.e.,
no detected sentiment), and the rest have balanced positive and negative sentiment scores. The

is consistent with previous reports of sentiment bias in language [16] and tweets [29]. As noted in
the Appendix A, the SentiStrength scores of a single tweet can be unreliable, so a single tweet does
not provide definitive information about the user’s sentiment. To obtain a more robust indication
of users’ sentiment, we can aggregate the scores of all the tweets produced by one user to obtain
a single score. Although aggregate scores can help overcome some issues, computing a single
score per author neglects the fact that Twitter users often interact with multiple people, and that
the sentiment of these interactions may vary substantially depending on the counterpart and the
nature of the exchange. Therefore using exclusively a single score per user can lead to information 5
loss, and provide a misleading indication about the user’s sentiment. To avoid these problems it
is necessary to incorporate the users’ interactions into our :::
the analysis.

4. Sentiment aggregation and social structure
Although SentiStrength has been reported to preform perform
:::::::
well on Twitter datasets [33], the
nuances and complexities of human language (for example sarcasm, idioms, negation, double
negatives, and a cavalier attitude towards grammar) make the process of automatically extracting
sentiment a challenging task. In addition, Twitter users do not exist in isolation, they interact
with each other through mentions, replies and friend/follower relationships. For this reason it
..............................................................
is necessary to incorporate social structure to obtain a more robust description of the user’s
disposition with regards to the marriage referendum. We focus our analysis on two types of
Twitter networks:
(i) Reciprocal mention network: In this network connections ::::::::::
Connections: exist between
users who have mentioned each other in tweets containing the tracked hashtags.
(ii) Reciprocal follower network: Connections exist between users who follow each other on
Twitter.
The information contained in these networks reflects complementary aspects of the interactions
between users: the reciprocated mention network includes interactions that arise specifically from
conversations about the Irish marriage referendum, and are constrained to the observation period
2015). We are interested in studying reciprocal mentions because they are a sign of
(8 to 23 of May ::::
genuine interactions between users [29,34]. In contrast, the follower network is not constrained to
discussions about the marriage referendum, nor to the observation period; this network provides
a broader view of how users are interested in each other. Table 1 provides a summary of statistics
for both networks.
By restricting the analysis to users who have made reciprocal mentions, we do exclude a large
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
number of users (Tab. 1). Although there are fewer users with reciprocal mentions, they have a
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
higher average out-degree (number of mention tweets written) than in the full network (34 in the
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
reciprocal group compared to 9 in the general population), which enables a more robust analysis
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
of their (noisy) sentiment scores. A possible drawback of focusing on reciprocal mentions is the
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
introduction of a selection bias. By excluding less active users, the population of those who have
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
not often expressed their beliefs or engaged in the debate may be underrepresented, in particular
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
users who favoured the less popular
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::
no position.
(a) Construction of the networks
We construct the directed mention network by searching each users’ tweets for mentions of other
users (indicated by a prefixed ‘@’). A mention often indicates that the author wishes to draw the
attention of another user to the content of the tweet; this could be original content directed at
a user, a retweet, or a reply. The announcement of the referendum results received widespread
international attention, which translated into a large number of tweets from users outside of
Ireland (see Fig.1(a)). We are specifically interested in detecting yes and no supporters, which
is why we further refine our networks to only include tweets generated before the day of the
referendum. Each mention creates a directed connection from the author of the tweet to the
user who has been mentioned. We can it::::::::: We:incorporate sentiment into this network
mentions.:::
by setting the weight of the connection to be the sentiment score of the tweet. When there are
multiple directed mentions, we average their sentiment scores. The resulting network is directed,
weighted and signed (negative weights indicate when the mentions have a predominantly
negative sentiment); it contains 40, 812 unique users, and 227, 203 directed connections. Note that

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
of 2.53 with a slight right skew; the path length distribution in the follower network around its

mean of 2.09.
:::::::::::
To incorporate the sentiment of tweets with the social structure of the networksdescribed
above, we compute four user attributes: the average in- and out-sentiment (SI and SO ) of
each user in the mentions :::::::mention :network, as well as the average in- and out-sentiment of
each user’s neighbours (SIn and SO n
). These quantities allow us to aggregate sentiment scores
whilst preserving the heterogeneity of the user’s interactions (e.g., supportive or adversarial
discussions).
Figure 4shows that users tend to have approximately the same average Figures 4(a) and (b)
::::::::::::::::

are ::::::
average out-neighbour sentiment is marginally higher than the average in-neighbour sentiment
(0.26 and vs ::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
symmetric around their mean with a slight skew to the right. The average sentiment scores are
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
centred about zero with a distribution that is approximately symmetric .
5. User sentiment alignment
As discussed in Sec. 3 (and Appendix A) the sentiment score of a single tweet is not itself is
not entirely reliable; however, the scores of a large number of tweets can provide a more robust
indication of the sentiment of the corpus. We test this intuition notion
:::::
against the null hypothesis
that the sentiment is generated by an inherently random process. For :: ::for:example, if the content
of the tweets is completely unrelated to sentiment, or if the sentiment extraction process gives
noisy scores that do not contain any information about the actual sentiment of the tweets.
More precisely, we would like seek
::::
to determine 1) whether user in- and out-sentiment scores
, and 2) if users whose tweets have similar sentiment tend to be clustered in the
are correlated; :
network. If the sentiment of the mention tweets that a user sends and receives is correlated,
and users tend to cluster together with others with similar sentiment, we could then consider
sentiment alignment as a proxy for homophily among users. We can reasonably expect this
because users with a similar disposition towards the referendum may communicate using similar
language. For instance, yes campaigners may use phrases that are more positively charged (e.g.,
“vote yes”) more often in their tweets, which results in a higher positive user sentiment (and vice
versa for no campaigners).
To answer 1), we examine whether there is a correlation between a user’s in- and out-
sentiment. The Pearson correlation between SI and SO is 0.60, which indicates a moderate linear
relationship between these two nodal attributes [35]. To confirm that this correlation is not due to

chance alone, we use a procedure based on redistributing the sentiment of a user’s tweets. The
randomisation procedure is:
• Sample a sentiment score for each connection from the observed distribution of link
scores with replacement. This keeps the network topology intact.
r
• Calculate the average randomised in- and out-sentiment of each user (SIr and SO ).
r r
• Calculate the correlation coefficient between SI and SO in the resampled network.
Figure 5 shows the comparison of the resulting distribution of the correlation between (SIr and
r
SO ) after 1,000 iterations of the procedure with the observed correlation of SI and SO in our data.
This result indicates that there is a nontrivial correlation between the sentiment of what a user
tweets and receives.
To answer 2) we investigate whether users with similar sentiment are clustered together in
the mention and follower networks. The observed correlation between SI and SO suggests that
users may be more likely to be connected to other users with similar sentiment scores. We create
three coarse class labels for users according to their sentiment — aggregate scores above zero
are “positive”, scores less than zero are “negative” and scores equal to zero are “unknown” —
and we find the fraction of links connecting users of these broad sentiment labels. We denote the
fraction of links between positive and positive users as fpp , the fraction of links between positive
and negative users as fpn , between positive and unknown users as fpu , and so on. In total there
are six types of links: fpp , fpn , fpu , fnn , fun and fuu . We randomise the class labels of each
user by sampling from the observed distributions with replacement, and recalculate the fraction
of connections; we repeat this process 1, 000 times. As before, we compare the randomised

for obtained from this procedure.
:::::::::::
The randomisation test in the mention network (blue box plots in Fig. 6) shows that it is highly
unlikely that the observed values of f , fpu , fnn , fun and fuu observed in the mention network
::::::::::::::: pp
arise from chance. There are fewer connections involving unknown users (fun and fuu and
fpu ) than we would expect by chance. In contrast, the connections between positive users (fpp )
fraction:of connections between
and negative users (fnn ) are higher than expected. The faction ::::::
positive and negative users (fpn ) is less than what we would expect (below the 25% quantile),
although this result is less robust than the rest. This analysis shows that users tend to mention
others:with similar sentiment in
in their tweets other users ::::: their tweets more frequently than
:::::::::::::
we would expect by chance. The same analysis in the follower network (yellow box plots in
Fig. 6) paints a broadly consistent picture. We find more links between positive users, fewer links
between positive and negative, and fewer links involving unknown users than we would expect
by random chance.
This analysis provides evidence of a relationship between users’ SI and SO , and their
preference to engage with users of a similar sentiment, and supports the notion :::::::intuition:that
in this case sentiment can be a proxy for homophily. Labelling users as positive, negative or
unknown, according to the sign of their SO may seem too coarse; to test this we performed a
similar analysis in which we split the users according to their quantile, or by above/below the
mean or median (see Appendix C). These tests produced the same results we present :::: similar
very ::::::
results to those presented
:::::::::::::::::::::
in this section.
6. Communities and sentiment
We are interested in finding groups of users that are not only tightly connected in both networks,
but also whose tweets have similar sentiment. For this task, we extract the communities in each
network, and enrich it the partition with the analysis of connection patterns from the previous
::::::::::
section. We use Markov Stability [36,37] to obtain a robust partition of the mentions network into
17 communities, and a partition of the follower network into 7 communities (Fig. 8(a) and (b)). 7) ::
The communities in the mention network arise specifically around from :::::

Now we seek a new grouping of users based on both partitions, and use the sentiment scores

to construct a measure of similarity.
To accomplish this task, we intersect the partitions of the two networks to obtain 62 sub-
communities (Fig. 8(c)). Each of these new groups contains users that are in the same community
in both networks; these users are not only more broadly interested in each other (because

sub-community i <U+2208> 1, . . . , 62i:::::::::::
sentiment as a proxy for homophily between users; therefore we use aggregate sentiment
scores as an indication of similarity between the 62 sub-communities. However, 49 of these
sub-communities have 20 users or fewer (204 ::: 224 :users in total). Because sentiment scores of
individual tweets are a noisy signal and these communities are small, we are unable to provide a
robust statistical description in these communities. To limit the effect of this noise we remove these
sub-communities and proceed to analyse the remaining 13 sub-communities. This procedure is
illustrated in Fig. 8.
We use k-means clustering to group the sub-communities according to the euclidean Euclidean
::::::::
distance between the average in- and out-sentiment and neighbour sentiment scores of each sub-
community. To choose the number of clusters we locate the bend in the plot of the total within
sum of squares of the within-sum-of-squares
::::::::::::::::::
sentiment difference of the members of the groups
(Fig. 8(e)). A marked flattening of the graph suggests that a finer clustering is not considerably
better at segregating sub-communities into distinct groups than a more parsimonious clustering
with fewer groups. The appropriate number of clusters is found at the “elbow” of the graph [38],
which in this case is three. Figure 8(f) shows the three regions in which we have classified the
sub-communities. We call these clusters of sub-communities community clusters: CC1 with 1, 064
users, CC2 with 604, and CC3 with 155. The community :::::::::: Community cluster CC1 has the highest
in- and out-sentiment, followed by CC2 and lastly CC3 .
Table 2 contains the summary statistics for each of these community clusters: CC1 has the
lowest average out degree in the mention network , followed by CC2 , and CC3 has the highest.
The clusters CC3 and CC2 are the most active; Fig. 9(a) shows that they consistently have the
highest number of tweets per users:::: user. Cluster CC3 is the most tightly connected of the three,
with a high transitivity coefficient in both the mention and follower network. These community
clusters are also consistently stratified by the sentiment of their tweets over time (Fig. 9(b)).

Figure 10 shows these classifications displayed on the layout of the mention network,
alongside their sentiment.
(a) Activity of community clusters
We examine which community clusters interact more frequently through mentions and
friend/follower links, the difference in the type of mention used (original, reply or retweet), and
the sentiment of the interactions between community clusters. Figure 11(a) shows that users in
the Passive Yes and Active No community clusters tend to follow mostly users within their own
group (80% and 61% of user links, respectively), whereas users in the Active Yes cluster follow a
disproportionately large number of users from Passive Yes (66%). Users in both Yes communities,
on average, follow only a small number of users in Active No (0.7% and 2.6% respectively). This
pattern also appears in the mention network, where most connections are between members of
the same community cluster (Fig. 11(b)). The strongest interaction between community clusters
consists of connections between users in the Yes groups in both networks.
We also examine which type of mentions (original, replies or retweets) are used by the
members of each group in their interactions. All community clusters retweet more often than
they produce original messages or replies (Table 4). Unsurprisingly, retweet connections occur
most often between groups where there is already a high number of follower connections. We
as ::
observe a similar situation :, :: is the case with original mention tweets. Interestingly, reply tweets
:::::::
do not follow this trend; these messages tend to be sent to community clusters where there are few
follower links to the source cluster. The users in the Active Yes and Active No community clusters
produce the most reply tweets: 24% 23% ::::
and 26% of their tweets are replies, respectively.

the users. This is yet another indication that users in these two groups were more likely to engage
with each other, even in the absence of strong structural ties. These results are consistent with
the notion that although the marriage referendum was a heated topic on Twitter, the engagement
between users with different views was limited to a small subset of highly active users. Note that
because
:::::::
we only study tweets made using two hashtags; with at least one of the hashtags, it is
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
possible that the actual number of replies was higher.
Given the differences in the type of mentions between the community clusters, we are also
interested in knowing inquire

whether the sentiment of the connections varies depending on the
source and the target group. We unfold the average out sentiment of each user (SO ) to see the
scores of tweets directed at each community cluster. Figure 12 shows that interactions with the
Active No community cluster have, on average, more negative sentiment than other interactions.
The interaction between the Active Yes and Active No clusters is overwhelmingly negative. Over
50% of users from both active community clusters use language with negative sentiment in their
mention tweets sent between each other. The interactions of the Passive Yes cluster with itself,
on the other hand, are overwhelmingly positive; over 50% have a positive sentiment score. The
opposite is true for any interaction of the Active Yes with the Active No community cluster. This is
the main feature that allows us to distinguish the Active Yescommunity cluster from the Passive

8. Conclusion 16
We have investigated the relationship between sentiment and social structure in the context of the
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
Twitter discussion about the 2015 Irish Marriage referendum. We computed the sentiment scores
of 204, 626 tweets posted by 36, 674 users, and constructed follower and mention networks among
users in which the weight of the connections corresponds to the sentiment of the interactions. Our
results show that although Although
::::::::
the sentiment score of individual tweets can be noisy, it can
be aggregated successfully using networks to study the interactions between users in a mention
and follower network. We performed extensive statistical tests to study the relationship between
the sentiment of users’ tweets and their interactions, both in general (i.e., friend/follower) and
topic-specific (i.e., from tweets about the referendum). The correlation between the sentiment
of mentions that a user sends and receives (the in- and out-sentiment) is positive and robust
..............................................................
to randomisation tests. Furthermore, our tests show that users in the mentions network with
positive and negative aggregate sentiment scores are more likely to be connected to users with
similar sentiment than would occur by chance; positive users are also more likely to follow
each other. The community structure of the networks shows that users with similar sentiment
tend to be clustered together. We combined By combining sentiment scores with the networks’
::::::::::::
communities we were
:::::::::::
able to find three distinct groups of users that we classified as either yes or
no supporters based on the content of their tweets and sentiment, and as active or passive based
on their activity. Interestingly, many of the mentions between the users in the yes and no groups
occurred in the absence of friend/follower links, which indicates the existence of topical dialogue
across ideological lines. These results show that sentiment and social structure are related yet

of users around topics of interest. This work can be extended in a number of directions, for
example by combining sentiment analysis with topic modelling and additional user features (such
as demographics, age, gender, or income) to obtain a more accurate picture of user disposition. We
anticipate that this work will also provide a basis for incorporating sentiment in opinion dynamics

A. Sentiment extraction with SentiStrength
SentiStrength [33] contains a lexicon of 2, 310 sentiment-annotated words and word stems (i.e.,
roots of words). The system finds the sentiment of a string (more precisely a sentence, or in this
case a tweet) of text by matching each word against the an ::
internal lexicon. The positive and
negative score of the string is the total positive and negative scores obtained
:::::::
from its words:,
and is
::::::
normalised to be between 1 and 5 for positive sentiment, and -1 and -5 for negative.
SentiStrength also accounts for some nuances of the language by including an extensive rule set
that includes negations, repeated letters (for emphasis), and booster words [33]. The rules for
punctuation do not apply to our dataset as we removed punctuation as part of the pre-processing
of the text. Figure S1 contains examples of how SentiStrength assigns positive and negative scores
to short strings of text, and how in some cases can miscalculate the sentiment of a tweet.
B. Accuracy of the classification of users
The classification of community clusters as either yes, no or unaligned in Sec. 7 was performed
manually by annotating a sample of 20% of users in each group. The classification of users was
based on their profile description and their tweets with the tracked hashtags, and was blinded to
the community cluster of the user. The profile descriptions are an indicator of which side users
are likely to support, as they often contain hashtags, words or phrases in support of yes or no
(e.g., #equalitymatters or #marriagematters can indicate support for yes or no). Tweets from the
referendum day often contain references to having voted or supported yes or no (e.g., “I voted
Actual 18
Yes No Total
Yes 297 (True yes) 23 (True no) 320
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000

for equality #voteyes #marref”). In the absence of an overt reference to supporting either side we
classified the user after examining all their tweets in our data. We assigned an unaligned label if
the user did not show a discernible leaning towards the yes or no side. Typically, users who were
..............................................................
classified as unaligned either had posted few tweets or their tweets did not have a discernible an ::
obvious
:::::::
leaning (e.g., “Interesting debate taking place now about #marref”).
After classifying the tweets from our random sample, we computed the proportion of yes, no, or
unaligned supporters in each community cluster. The proportion of yes supporters in community
clusters CC1 and CC2 is 90% and 96%; as a result, we labelled these groups as yes community
clusters. We labelled In::
CC3 about 71% of the sampled members support voting against same-sex
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
marriage, so we labelled this community
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
cluster as a no community cluster because its proportion
of nosupporters is 71%:::::group. To find the accuracy of these labels we construct a confusion
matrix [39] (Table S1), which provides a breakdown of true and false positives.
We can calculate the overall and balanced accuracy for yes and no supporters using Table S1.
The overall accuracy is the ratio of “true yes” and “true no” supporters (297 and 23, respectively)
to the total number of users in the sample (358). The overall accuracy for the sample is 89%.
However, overall accuracy is known to be biased towards more frequent classes. To correct
for this bias we calculate the balanced accuracyobtain the balanced accuracy [39] by calculating
::::::::::::::::::::::
the fraction of correctly classified yes or no supporters out of the total number of actual
supporters,:and averaging the two (297/326 and 23/32, respectively). The balanced accuracy is
then (0.5(297/326 + 23/32) = 0.81).
In Sec. 7 we labelled the community clusters in terms of both the dominant user leaning and
activity levels. We defined ::CC1 as the Passive yes community cluster, CC2 the : ; Active yes, and
CC3 the ;:Active nocommunity cluster. In an ideal setting, we would report the balanced accuracy
for the three types of users. In practice, however, it is a difficult and subjective exercise to discern
Passive Yes from Active Yes users at an individual level. The ,::: so distinction between passive and
active is based on the average user’s activity (number of tweets) in each community cluster
shown in :(Fig. 9(a). Therefore, a balanced accuracy for both voter classification and activity is
not viable. If we were to make a distinction between CC1 and CC2 the balanced accuracy would
be 1/3(183/205 + 114/121 + 23/32) = 0.85, treating CC1 and CC2 separately. :).:
C. Robustness of randomisation
In Sec. 5 we showed that the sentiment of users’ in-neighbourhoods is positively correlated (in
agreement with previous reports ::: finding
e.g., [17]) in both the mention and follower network; this ::::::
allows us to use it sentiment
::::::::
as a proxy for homophily. We arrived at this result by showing that
users with similar sentiment, in particular positive users, were connected more often then we
would have expected by random chance. These results are robust to how we group these distinct ::::::
groupings
:::::::::::
Section. 5 we applied :::::
of users by sentiment. In Sec:::::: shows:a coarse labelling of users
according to their sentiment score (“positive”, “negative” or “unknown”). Here we show that a
A
::
finer labelling of users also produces similar results. We test three alternative ways of labelling
users:
(i) Divide users into groups in which the out-sentiment is below (m0.5 1
0 ) and above (m0.5 ) the
mean.

squares and red triangles marks the observed fraction of links in the data. A green square indicates that the observed

triangle indicates
the observed fraction falls inside the lower 5% and upper 95% quantiles of the randomised distribution.
(ii) Divide users into groups in which the out-sentiment is below (q00.5 ) and above (q0.5 1
) the
median.
0.5
(iii) Divide users into groups by the out-sentiment quartiles (q00.25 , q0.25 0.75 1
, q0.5 , q0.75 ).
We then randomise the network with these labels in the same way as described in Sec. 5. Figure:;
Fig. S2 shows the results from the new randomisation tests, which are consistent with our results
:::
in Sec. 5 of the Main Text. The similarity observed between Fig. S2(a) and (b) is due to the fact
that the mean and median of the out sentiment distribution are close. In both cases users above
the mean and median tend to be connected more than we would have expected by chance.
Figure S2(c) tells a similar story, where users in the top two quartiles are more likely to be
connected with each other than what we would expect by chance.
