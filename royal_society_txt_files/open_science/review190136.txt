MS TITLE: Interactions between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors
In this manuscript, the interactions between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors
(bubble breakup and coalescence) were studied with the support of VOF numerical modeling.
Overall, it makes good sense for assessing the mass transfer efficiency for bubbling system and
the transport of gas bubble in liquid phase.
This manuscript demonstrates well the methodology and clear objectives. However, the grammar
and English used to write the manuscript needs to be double checked for errors. There are some
occasions when the sentences are not clearly understood by the reader.
1. Abstract: Please provide more quantitative information of the results. Show us how the
interactions between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors happen, not only the general
description.
2. Introduction: Do not just “list” the references, try to summarize and clearly show the state-of-
the-art in this field.
3. Model setup: (1) Reorganize this part, try to follow the procedure: concept model, hypothesis,
numerical model (include main equations, the initial and boundary condition), geometry and
solving method, parameters for model building and data for validation. (2) Only buoyancy is

considered during the bubble rising, why? Show the force analysis. (3) Did the paper [32] and [33]
consider “Interactions between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors”? If not, how can
you use their data for validation? If it is, what are the differences between your researches and
theirs? Show more details about the two references.
4. Results and discussion: (1) you said “Bubbles with initial diameters of 4 mm, 5 mm, and 6 mm
were investigated when they were cut by a wire.” So add modeling information about the wire.
(2) Only show the modeling result is not enough, try to show the mechanism and explain why the
process occurs. For example, you say “To further study the influence of mass transfer on bubble
motions, the rising process of 5 mm bubble was investigated (see Fig. 12). The white lines are axel
wires. When there is no mass transfer happened, the bubble rises vertically at the very start and
then it deviates from the axel wire. As a result, the bubble is cut into two unequal-diameter
daughter bubbles. While as for the bubble with mass transfer, it rises along the axel wire and then
is cut into two equal-diameter daughter bubbles. The comparison shows that the mass transfer
cannot be ignored when studying the bubble behaviors.” So, why that happen?
5. Discussion and conclusions did not clearly focus on your subject,” Interactions between gas-
liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors”. In your discussion section please link your modeling
results with a broader and deeper literature review, and explain how the mass transfer influence
the bubble behaviors.
6. The English should be polished for publish.
In general, I recommend this manuscript “major revision”.

Responses to the Comments of Reviewer 1
General Comment
The coalescence and cutting behavior of bubbles and mass transfer were investigated
numerically. It can be published after a major revision.
Response: We greatly appreciate your positive comments.
Comment 1: How to control the quantity of gas from inner gas to gas-liquid interface,
similarly to the mass transfer rate of CO2 form interface to liquid?
Response: Thank you a lot for your suggestion. In the simulation, the quantity of gas from
inner gas to gas-liquid interface and the mass transfer rate of CO2 from interface to liquid are not
controlled. Based on the mass transfer mechanism, the continuous mass flux through the interface
means that there is no mass accumulation. Hence, the quantity of CO2 in the gas phase of the
meshes belong to the interface was transferred to the liquid phase completely. As for the mass
transfer processes in the gas phase and liquid phase, they are related to the fluid flow and species
diffusion.
Comment 2: Eq. 8, how to obtain Ngas-int and Nint-liq?
Response: Thank you for your advice. The mass transfer processes in the gas phase and liquid
phase are related to the species diffusion and fluid flow. The Ngas-int which represents the mass flux
from gas to interface can be determined by the following equation.
<U+F0B6>Ci , g
N gas <U+F02D>int <U+F03D> <U+F02D> Di , mg
<U+F0B6>Z Eq.R1
The Nint-liq which represents the mass flux from interface to liquid can be determined by Eq.R2.
<U+F0B6>Ci ,l
Nint <U+F02D>liq <U+F03D> <U+F02D> Di , ml
<U+F0B6>Z Eq.R2
There is no mass accumulation at the interface. Hence, the Eq.8 in the manuscript was revised as
follow:
<U+F0B6>Ci , g <U+F0B6>Ci ,l
N gas <U+F02D>int <U+F03D> <U+F02D> Di , mg <U+F03D> Nint <U+F02D>liq <U+F03D> <U+F02D> Di , ml

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The letters in Fig.3 of the original manuscript (Fig.4
in the revised manuscript) have been enlarged and they can be read clearly.

Comment 4: The serial number of table should be rewritten in text. For example, Table 2 in
page 9 line 25 should be Table 3.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The serial number of tables has been checked and
corrected.
Comment 5: The mass of CO2 bubble with diameter 2 mm is about 7.5 × 10-9 kg. However,
the dissolved CO2 from bubble with diameter 2 mm into liquid is about 10-6 kg at 0.5 s in fig. 8. It
is impossible. It is the same to other bubbles.

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We simulated the CO2 bubble rising behaviors and
the mass transfer process in 2D meshes to implement the relevant studies. This simulation method
is used widely in the investigations about gas-liquid mass transfer (Dani et al., International
Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering, 2006, 4:1-21; Hayashi and Tomiyama, Journal of
Computational Multiphase Flows, 2011, 3:247-261; Aboulhasanzadeh et al., Chemical
Engineering Science, 2012, 75:456-467; Bao et al., Chemical Engineering Science, 2015,
135:76-88). In 2D simulations, only x and y (or x and z, y and z, etc) coordinates were used. The
third coordinate was set as 1 automatically which is related to the unit system. In the simulation of
this study, the unit system is set as SI unit so that the length unit is meter. When calculate the
dissolved CO2 in water, volume is needed so that the deviation occurred. The size of
computational domain is in the magnitude of “mm” while the third coordinate is in the magnitude
of “m”. Therefore, the deviation of 103 exists. The order of magnitude for the relevant contents in
the manuscript was corrected.
Comment 6: In fig. 9, please check the order of magnitude.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The order of the magnitude in the manuscript has
been checked and revised.
Comment 7: Page 13, lines 44-50, “For 3 mm bubbles with mass transfer, the ratio of 0.67 is
86.1% and 4.15 times higher than that for 5 mm bubbles and 7 mm bubbles, respectively.” It is
incomprehensible. In addition, the critical interval is 2.0 mm for 3 mm bubbles, and 1.8 mm and
0.9 mm for 5 mm and 7 mm bubbles, respectively. Therefore, smaller side-by-side bubbles are
more difficult to coalesce.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The sentence has been revised as follow and it is
comprehensible now.
For 3 mm bubbles with mass transfer, the ratio is 0.67 while for 5 mm bubbles and 7 mm
bubbles, the ratios are 0.36 and 0.13, respectively. (Please see the highlighted parts in Paragraph 2
Page14 in the revised manuscript)
3
The critical interval is 2.0 mm for 3 mm bubbles, and 1.8 mm and 0.9 mm for 5 mm and 7 mm
bubbles, respectively. When the interval is 2.0 mm for the bubbles with different diameters, 3 mm
bubble can coalesce while the 5 mm bubble and 7 mm bubble cannot. Hence, it is easy for the
smaller bubbles to coalesce. To make it more comprehensible, the following contents are added in
the revised manuscript.
The interval is the shortest distance between the interfaces of the two bubbles at the same
horizontal line while the critical interval means that the longest interval for the bubbles to
coalesce. The ratio of interval to bubble diameter reflects the difficulty of bubble coalescence. For
3 mm bubbles with mass transfer, the ratio is 0.67 while for 5 mm bubbles and 7 mm bubbles, the
ratios are 0.36 and 0.13, respectively. It is clear that smaller side-by-side bubbles are easier to
coalesce. For example, 3 mm bubble can coalesce while the 5 mm bubble and 7 mm bubble cannot
coalesce when the interval is 2.0 mm for the bubbles. (Please see the highlighted parts in
Paragraph 2 Page14 in the revised manuscript)
Comment 8: Page 14, line 7, “the 3 mm side-by-side bubbles rise on negative direction
initially…” what does “negative direction” mean?
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The “negative direction” in the sentence means that
the 3 mm side-by-side bubbles rise away from each other. The sentence has been revised as
follow.
Under other interval conditions, the 3 mm side-by-side bubbles rise away from each other
initially and then move closer to contact with each other. (Please see the highlighted parts in
Paragraph 2 Page14 in the revised manuscript)
Comment 9: Nomenclature, “S” is not mentioned in text.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The “S” in the nomenclature has been deleted.

General Comment
In this manuscript, the interactions between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors
(bubble breakup and coalescence) were studied with the support of VOF numerical modeling.
Overall, it makes good sense for assessing the mass transfer efficiency for bubbling system and the
transport of gas bubble in liquid phase.
This manuscript demonstrates well the methodology and clear objectives. However, the
grammar and English used to write the manuscript needs to be double checked for errors. There
are some occasions when the sentences are not clearly understood by the reader.
Response: We greatly appreciate your encouraging and positive comments.
Comment 1: Abstract: Please provide more quantitative information of the results. Show us
how the interactions between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors happen, not only the
general description.
Response: Thank you for your instructive advice. The abstract is revised and more quantitative
information of the results is provided. The revision could reflect the interaction between gas-liquid
mass transfer and bubble behavior. The contents are shown as follow.
The results show that the absolute slopes of the curves for mass fraction inside the single rising
bubbles with the diameters from 3 mm to 6 mm decreases from 0.09325 to 0.02818. It means that
small single bubbles have higher mass transfer efficiency. The daughter bubbles of cutting
behavior and initial side-by-side bubbles of coalescence behavior also perform better than the
initial large bubbles and coalesced bubbles, respectively. The bubble behaviors effect the mass
transfer process. However, the latter also reacts upon the former. The critical intervals between
the side-by-side bubbles decreases from 2.0 mm to 0.9 mm when the bubble diameter changes
from 3 mm to 7 mm. For the coalescence behavior without mass transfer, the critical intervals are
larger because there is no influence of concentration around the bubbles on the bubble motion.
The coalescence of cut daughter bubbles is also influenced by the concentration. It was suggested
that the interaction between the gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors cannot be ignored
in the future studies.

Comment 2: Introduction: Do not just “list” the references, try to summarize and clearly show
the state-of-the-art in this field.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The introduction was revised and the references
were summarized to clearly show the state-of-the-art in the field. The revisions are shown as
follow.
The previous studies have been conducted to investigate the bubbles coalescence and breakup
behaviors. The coalescence behavior can be classified as two types: in-line [5-7] and side-by-side
[8, 9]. For the in-line bubbles coalescence, there are two coaxial bubbles and the upper one is
called leading bubble while the other one is called trailing bubble. The drag force of the liquid
acting on the bubbles [10] and the interaction between the in-line bubbles [11] were studied. The
coalescence behaviors of the in-line bubbles are not only direct coalescence but also coalescence
with conjunction [12]. For the side-by-side bubbles coalescence, there are two parallel bubbles
rising together initially and then the interval between them decreases until they coalesce [13]. The
properties of the gas and the liquid have impacts on the coalescence [14]. Just like the in-line
bubbles, the coalescence behaviors of the side-by-side bubbles can also be classified as two types.
One of them is direct coalescence and the other one is coalescence with bouncing [15]. Moreover,
the possibility of coalescence is determined by the initial interval between the bubbles and the
coalesced bubbles may also breakup if the diameter is large enough [16].
Bubble breakup behavior also usually occurs in the rising process [17-19]. It is generally
recognized that the bubbles tend to breakup when the surface tension of the interface is changed
greatly. There is a special bubble breakup condition called cutting, in which the bubble is cut by a
wire or wire mesh set along their rising path [20, 21]. When the bubbles contact with the wire,
three behaviors of cut, bypass and stick will happen. The behaviors are decided by the rising
velocity and properties of gas-liquid system. When the wire mesh is set, the bubbles will contact
with the center or the crossing of the meshes. Similar behaviors would occur. In our previous
study [22], a wire mesh was set above the tray in the distillation column and the results shown
that the mean bubble diameter decreases sharply. The above studies are of great guiding
2
significance to the coalescence and breakup behaviors, but the influences of the behaviors on
mass transfer have not been investigated and the interaction between them is also rarely
investigated.
The interaction between the bubble behaviors and the gas-liquid mass transfer for single
bubble rising process has been recognized. However, the researchers paid more attention to
liquid-side mass transfer, while the gas-side or coupled two-side mass transfer are rarely studied
[23-26]. The liquid-side mass transfer process is influenced by the properties of the liquid such as
density, surface tension and so on. Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method is widely used in the
simulation studies [27]. For the calculation of mass transfer process, a two-variable method is
investigated and shows good computations for the high Schimidt and Reynolds number bubbles
[28]. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) could also simulate the mass transfer process. The effect
of interface contamination on mass transfer can be calculated accurately based on the method
[29]. Experimental investigation about mass transfer processes is another research focus [4]. A
new experiment method with some specific chromogenic methods was developed [30]. There are
several advantages of the new method such as the visualization of the concentration distribution.
Besides the liquid-side mass transfer, Saboni et al.[31] studied the soluble substance
transportation from liquid into bubble and the concentration distribution forms in bubble based
on simulation. However, the gas-side mass transfer process and the behaviors with mass transfer
were rarely studied.

Comment 3: Model setup: (1) Reorganize this part, try to follow the procedure: concept model,
hypothesis, numerical model (include main equations, the initial and boundary condition),
geometry and solving method, parameters for model building and data for validation. (2) Only
buoyancy is considered during the bubble rising, why? Show the force analysis. (3) Did the paper
[32] and [33] consider “Interactions between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors”? If
not, how can you use their data for validation? If it is, what are the differences between your
researches and theirs? Show more details about the two references.
Response: Thank you for your insightful suggestions.

(1) The “Model setup” was reorganized as you suggested. Please see the relevant section.
(2) The initial bubbles are driven by buoyancy but there is also gravity force acts on the bubbles.
The force analysis was added in the revised manuscript as follow.
The buoyancy force and gravity force act on the bubble during the whole rising process (see
figure 3). The total force can be calculated by Eq.9.
Fy <U+F03D> Fb <U+F02D> FG (9)
Figure 3. Force analysis for bubbles.
(Please see the highlighted parts in Page 4 and Page 5 in the revised manuscript)
(3) Paper [32] and [33] did not illustrate the interaction directly but the data are obtained by
experiments. When the bubbles form and rise in the liquid, the interaction between gas-liquid
mass transfer and bubble behaviors exists constitutionally though the objectives of the papers do
not focus on this issue. Hence, the experimental data are obtained under the underlying premise of
the interaction and they can be used to implement model validation. Besides, the calculation
model about mass transfer process is usually validated by the experiment data about fluid field
such as the bubble shape and rising velocity (Hayashi et al., International Journal of Multiphase
Flow, 2014, 58:236-245; Bao et al., Chemical Engineering Science, 2015, 135:76-88). The
simulation results can illustrate the research issue well. In this paper, the data about fluid field and
concentration wakes are compared with the simulation results and the comparisons show good
consistency. Therefore, the model in this paper can be validated by paper [32] and [33]. Thanks
again for your insightful suggestion.
More details about the two references were added as follow.
In the work of Zahedi et al., air was injected through the orifice with 4.5 mm diameter and
4
water was initially filled in the domain. The air flow rate was controlled at 2.5E-7 m3·s-1 by a
pump with flow controller. The formation and rising processes of the bubble was recorded by a
high speed camera with the speed of 60 frames/s. The processes were analyzed by the recorded
movie files with snapshots taken every 0.016s……. Besides, the model was also validated based on
the concentration wake structure of the dissoluble gas in the liquid through comparing the results
obtained from Kong et al. [33]. To obtain the concentration wake structure, dual-emission dye
C-SNARF-4F was selected and LIF technique was applied. The pH distribution around the bubble
was captured and then the concentration distribution could be calculated by the conversion
function. (Please see the highlighted parts in Paragraph 2 Page 6 in the revised manuscript)
Comment 4: Results and discussion: (1) you said “Bubbles with initial diameters of 4 mm, 5
mm, and 6 mm were investigated when they were cut by a wire.” So add modeling information
about the wire. (2) Only show the modeling result is not enough, try to show the mechanism and
explain why the process occurs. For example, you say “To further study the influence of mass
transfer on bubble motions, the rising process of 5 mm bubble was investigated (see Fig. 12). The
white lines are axel wires. When there is no mass transfer happened, the bubble rises vertically at
the very start and then it deviates from the axel wire. As a result, the bubble is cut into two
unequal-diameter daughter bubbles. While as for the bubble with mass transfer, it rises along the
axel wire and then is cut into two equal-diameter daughter bubbles. The comparison shows that
the mass transfer cannot be ignored when studying the bubble behaviors.” So, why that happen?
Response: Thank you for your suggestions.
(1) The modeling information about the wire was revised in the “Geometry and Solution
methods” section as follow.
Under the bubble cutting condition, the tenuous wire was set at 40 mm in height from the
bottom of the domain. The shape of the wire is set to square so that the grid type of the domain can
be meshed as high-quality quadrilateral grids. Its side length is only 0.4 mm which is much
smaller than the bubble diameters so the influence of wire shape can be ignored. The sides of the
wire were set as wall boundary conditions.

(2) The concentration distribution could reflect the influence of the mass transfer on bubble
motion. Huang and Saito (Chemical Engineering Science, 2017, 157:182-199) verified the
influence through analyzing the rising path under different conditions in the experiments. In this
paper, the differences between the behaviors with and without mass transfer processes can also be
analyzed by the concentration distribution. The added contents are shown as follow.
When there is no mass transfer happened, the bubble rises vertically at the very start and then it
deviates from the axel wire. The deviation is caused by the fluid field and there is no mass transfer
to offset the deviation. As a result, the bubble is cut into two unequal-diameter daughter bubbles.
While as for the bubble with mass transfer, it rises along the axel wire and then is cut into two
equal-diameter daughter bubbles. When the bubble moves close to the wire, the concentration
distribution below the bubble is symmetric (see figure13c). The high concentration regions also
arrange symmetrically. Hence, the bubble is pushed vertically and then cut into two
equal-diameter daughter bubbles. (Please see the highlighted parts in Paragraph 1 Page 12 in the
revised manuscript)
For the more detailed information about the mechanism, quantitative data of simulation and
experiments need to be obtained and the analysis method also needs to be developed. This is a
great research direction and we will try our best to conduct a thorough study in the future works.
Thanks again for your instructive suggestion.
Comment 5: Discussion and conclusions did not clearly focus on your subject,” Interactions
between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors”. In your discussion section please link
your modeling results with a broader and deeper literature review, and explain how the mass
transfer influence the bubble behaviors.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. Little literatures about the interactions between
gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors for several single bubbles are really less, especially
for the cutting behavior and coalescence behavior. More researches focus on the changes about
fluid field or the determination of mass transfer coefficient when the above behaviors happen at
the macro level (Oloms et al., Chemical Engineering Science, 2001, 56:6359-6365; Shimizu et al.,
Chemical Engineering Journal, 2000, 78:21-28; Wongsuchoto et al., Chemical Engineering

Journal, 2003, 92:81-90; Martin et al., Chemical Engineering Science, 2007, 62:1741-1752;
Koynov et al., AIChE Journal, 2005, 51:2786-2800). We added the analysis about the interaction
in the “Results and discussion” section as you suggested to highlight the subject (Please see the
above responses). Besides, we revised and added the following contents in the “Conclusion”
section to further illustrate the subject of this paper.
Bubble cutting behavior was divided into three steps in this paper, which are initial single
bubble rising step, daughter bubbles rising step, and coalesced bubble rising step. The change
rates of dissolved CO2 in water for three steps were compared and the rate of the second step is
the highest. The absolute values of the slopes for CO2 mass fraction insides bubbles obtained in
the second step are also the highest. Moreover, the cutting of the initial large bubble and the
coalescence of daughter bubbles were analyzed to be related to the CO2 mass fraction distribution
compared with the bubble without mass transfer. The symmetric concentration distribution pushes
the bubble vertically so that the equal-diameter daughter bubbles are formed. (Please see the
highlighted parts in Paragraph 3 Page 17 in the revised manuscript)
Besides, compared the mass transfer conditions before with those after coalescing, it is found
that the coalescence behavior has negative impact on mass transfer. The concentration
distribution around the bubbles is relatively homogeneous, suggesting that the mass transfer
influence bubble motion slightly. The differences of critical intervals for the bubbles with and
without mass transfer are not obvious but they do exist.
Different bubble behaviors make the mass transfer efficiency various. The daughter bubbles
shows better mass transfer performance than the initial large bubble. Meanwhile, the mass
transfer also has impact on the bubble behaviors. The bubble with symmetric concentration
distribution can be cut equally while the bubble without mass transfer is cut unequally. Hence, the
interaction between the gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors cannot be ignored in the
future studies. (Please see the highlighted parts in Page 18 in the revised manuscript)
Comment 6: The English should be polished for publish.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The English has been polished. The grammar and
spelling errors have been revised. Some of the revisions are shown as follow.

Interactions between gas-liquid mass transfer and bubble behaviors were investigated to
improve the understanding of the relationship between the two sides. (Please see the highlighted
parts in “Abstract” of Page 1 in the revised manuscript)
The above studies are of great guiding significance to the coalescence and breakup behaviors,
but the influences of the behaviors on mass transfer have not been investigated and the interaction
between them is also rarely investigated. (Please see the highlighted parts in Paragraph 1 Page 2 in
the revised manuscript)
However, the researchers paid more attention to liquid-side mass transfer, while the gas-side or
coupled two-side mass transfer are rarely studied. (Please see the highlighted parts in Paragraph 2
Page 2 in the revised manuscript)
Based on the summary about the previous works, the coalescence and breakup behaviors for
bubble rising with mass transfer need to be further investigated for improving chemical equipment
performance. (Please see the highlighted parts in Paragraph 3 Page 2 in the revised manuscript)
As mentioned above, the coalescence behaviors of daughter bubbles produced from large
bubbles have been analyzed, and the CO2 mass fraction distribution around the rising bubbles
influences the bubbles motion. (Please see the highlighted parts in Paragraph 1 Page 13 in the
revised manuscript)
Along with CO2 mass transfer processes, the rising behavior, the cutting behavior of single
bubbles, and the coalescence behavior of side-by-side bubbles were studied. (Please see the
highlighted parts in Paragraph 1 Page 17 in the revised manuscript)
