This manuscript provides an analysis of the tooth development of various sharks with a special
focus on Squaliforms, a peculiar clade gathering most of the deep sea sharks having an unusual
cutting blade dentitions compared to most of the elasmobranchs. This kind of study is
desperately needed as current knowledge on elasmobranch tooth development. In addition, this
study also tackles the possible mechanic (as modification of inherited alternate tooth ordering
patterns usually observed in other sharks and batoids) and phylogenetic backgrounds that lead to
the observed distribution of tooth development among the Squalean taxa analyzed. So, this is an
interesting work on the teeth development of elasmobranchs, with particular emphasis on
Squalus, one of the more studied Squaliforms.
However it will be worth publishing with revisions I consider as major. Of particular concerns
are the lack of methodology to compare tooth pattern of embryos (without no clear idea about
stage of development or TL size), the reduced number of very relevant specimens (only 2
embryos of S. acanthias with probable different ages and thus developmental stages) compared
to other mature embryos or adults without age and/or without strong interest, and the use of
very partial phylogeny that forms the basis of some of their major conclusions. If the authors'
introduction scientifically sound and highlights clearly the goal of developmental studies in
elasmobranchs to identify shared pattern characters for the vertebrate dentition as a whole
(abstract and introduction), the issues raised should be toned down because the results remain
extremely qualitative, subjective and must be focused on difference between the first
development states in tooth pattern between Squalus and Pristiophorids, only. If the inadequacy
of the Squaliform tooth data set to say anything meaningful, the issues suffer from lack of
significant results to make some of the statements in the final conclusion.
First of all, I think the manuscript will gain in clarity if they really discuss about the uncertainties
concerning the phylogenetic relationships of Squalea and Squaliforms (sometimes including
Echinorhinids) in Introduction. That would be much more logical and easier to read. For instance,
they clearly report that the monophyly of Squalea is not subject to caution but they omitted to
report in fig 1 (and last figure 8) the other major clades (Hexanchiforms, Echinorhinids,
Chlamydoselachids and Squatinid) which contribute to root the Squalea/Galea node. But more
consistent, I would also like the authors to explain (especially in discussion) why they exclude all
these previous clades in their inferences, especially when these last ones share very differents
morphologies that possibly valid or invalid their model of modification of inherited alternate
tooth ordering pattern. In fact, they chose to use a partial phylogenetic framework without any
comments about the uncertainties concerning all the unstudied taxa.
The second major disagreement concerns the methodology and data set used in developmental
study. The authors deal with two embryos from S. acanthias (without length size) one from a
Squalus sp. (120mm TL but unusable picture 5H), one from D. calcea (without size), one from C.
coelolepis (mature specimen?), one of E. spinax (without size and unusable picture on fig. 4E and
7G), and one of Pristiophorus cirratus and attempt to derive evolutionary implications from
these. But there is no mention of which development states or at least size the observed embryos
are (except such term as mature or not)? Authors used the SAT number (l.150) of specimen to
have idea of relative stage of development. My concern is that these relative age between
different taxa could merely represent ontogenetic variation within taxa. Moreover authors reports
latter (l. 452-455) that the number of replacement tooth rows is constant throughout ontogeny in
Etmopetus, one of Squaliforms observed? So I don’t understand how authors can use SAT
number as relative developmental stage between different taxa if this doesn’t change with growth
3
in one… Many other statement are really unclear as for instance l. 327-330,”in the less developed
specimen [ S. acanthias SAT6] six tooth row are represented near the symphysis but teeth
representing up to eleven rows are present in more proximal position (fig. 6G-H)”. I don’t see no
more than 6 proximal rows on fig. 6 G-H? (but in fig. 6b, F).
The third major disagreement is that we have no information about when and how the alternate
pattern (observable on the three embryos of Squalus) becomes oblique to form the peculiar
cutting blade with interlocked teeth in adults ? This is a major point to discuss but it is resumed
in line 380-392 by a short assumption (“by modification of the alternate developmental pattern”)
without any other evidences or observations? Rest of the observations (8. Tooth development in
other squaliforms l.394-461) do not allow to resolve this and many results remain extremely
qualitative and subjective. For instance, in Deania embryo (fig. 5I-J) authors claim that the
“alternate pattern is evident in upper jaw” (l. 404) despite that there is “relatively few teeth that
could be recognized” (l.403). Nothing is evident on fig. 5J (upper jaw) but in lower dentition, this
is not the case and teeth are aligned in clear parallel rows, as in adults. Reality is that the
development stage of observed embryo of Deania is probably too mature to have any idea about
how the cutting blade is developing. It is exactly the same case with the lower jaw of “mature”
embryo of C. coelolepis (fig. 7A-F) and moreover I don’t understand the assumption of authors
when they argue that (l. 426-) “the first tooth row is present on the jaw margin but have not yet
reached functional position […] as teeth are not shed until replacement teeth are functional
position, it is evident that no older tooth row had been present and subsequently lost” It’s a
meaningless assumption because: 1. it is a mature embryo 2. If an alternate pattern really precede
the oblique one in squaliforms (the aim of this work), teeth are continually shed before to be
functional as a blade and thus, those observed on jaw margin can be the last row with alternate
pattern? Other example of disagreement, authors remark (l. 438-440) that the upper teeth “appear
to show an alternate pattern but degree of resolution and strong curvature of the jaws make
difficult to assess”. It ‘is a bit superficial, especially when they use it in final conclusions. They
remove the artefacts of jaw curvature for Squalus, they can do it for C. coelepis too. The same
insubstantial arguments were developed with E. spinax (eg. l.460-461 “the relative position […]
suggests that the upper teeth are arranged in alternate pattern” and those, despite that the “upper
teeth are far less well resolved” (fig. 7G). Finally authors (Part 9 Interpretation of tooth
development in heterodont squaliforms) summarized all these very questionable observations in
Squaliforms to conclude that (l. 489-490) “it is probable that the embryonic alternate stage of tooth
development as seen in Squalus […] do not occur in these taxa.”
Final discussions (part 11-12.) is of the same kind, mixing some real observations (comparison
Pristiophorus /Squalus) and very questionable statements (e.g. l. 524-525) “upper dentition of
embryonic and adult Centroscymnus and Etmopterus clearly shows an alternate pattern”(see
remarks before). Some other issues raised should be toned down regarding the real results of
their analysis (e.g. l 565-567 “Examination of squalean embryonic dentition has revealed that a
single file tooth pattern is not generated from these types of identical tooth file but from
modification of an alternate pattern” Such assumption is free , there is no regard about other
Squalean as Hexanchids, Echinorhinids, unobserved Squaliforms and more exasperating, in
contradiction with the observations of analyzed Squaliforms (Centroscymnus-Etmopterus) where
there are a single file tooth pattern in lower jaws of embryos…). These omissions are striking in
fig. 8. If we plot their models onto a more complete phylogenetic tree (including basal squalea as
Hexanchids, Echinorhinids, Chlamydoselachidis and Squatinids), the final signal is a bit more
questionable or at least more complex… I am surprised that the authors do not discuss about this.
My view is that the submitted manuscript contains significant weaknesses in the data and the
analysis, such that they provide only weak support for the results and interpretations, thus
reducing much of the discussion to many speculations. I have not provided an annotated pdf of
the ms. Some of other remarks I have are trivial ["Dalatias" and not "Dalatius" in whole text;
Check figure captions 1 [which is A and B] and 8 [what’s meaning C and D]; there are also no
clear links between all the figures and the text, which makes the latter difficult to read. Some of
4
them can be removed (e.g. fig. 4E-G = fig. 7G-I) or at least deeply reduced (e.g. fig. 4a-D, fig7A-F).
The use of Proximal/distal (l. 171-172) terms (e.g. Underwood et al., 2015 and this MS) is a bit
confusing with the dental terminology used to describe isolated tooth in many works, this one
included (Pages 8-11 of the MS where authors described the tooth morphology with distal/mesial
vs. distal = toward the jaw joint (commissural)/ mesial = toward the symphysis (symphyseal).

Editor Comments to Author (Professor Kevin Padian):

Comments to the Author:
I am very interested in this manuscript and I would like to see the authors have enough time to
answer the concerns of the reviewer, so for this reason I recommend to reject and allow re-
submission rather than hold them to the strict time-line of a "revise." I understand many of the
5
reviewer's concerns, but I think that the authors could make a case that small sample or size
differences may not invalidate their conclusions. To me, the strongest argument would be to map
these ontogenetic changes on phylogenies a bit more clearly than they are now done. There is a
lot of taxonomic and developmental information for a reader to absorb (especially a non-
specialist in sharks) and the authors' points could be made more accessible with a couple of
explicit diagrams of how things change phylogenetically and ontogenetically. Selfishly, I am
always looking for good 3x2 diagrams of concepts to put into the ppts that I show my vertebrate
evolution classes! But I also think this paper could be better appreciated with a bit more graphical
information.

dentitions. I think this study provides valuable data but it is currently not structured very well.
8
Below are a number of suggestions to improve how the manuscript could be put together in a
more rigorous and exciting manner.
The abstract does not provide a good comprehensive overview of what data is presented in the
paper.
The paper really needs to be contextualized outside of shark dentitions. It is really unclear why
we want to know about what data is presented.
The questions being asked in the paper are not clearly defined early in the Introduction. The
beginning of the introduction talks a lot about shark diversity and it is unclear where the paper is
headed. Stating the hypotheses to be addressed early on would help focus the Introduction.
Additionally, some attempt should be made to broaden the inferences made in this study to other
studies of vertebrate teeth or other structures.
The use of the term “developmental plasticity” in this study as in page 3 line 58 could cause
confusion. I think a term like evolutionary lability would be more appropriate as the study is not
really concentrating on what happens during the single lifetime of an individual.
I think the mapping of the traits onto a phylogeny needs to be done much more rigorously. In
figure 9, the plotting of different traits on different phylogenetic topologies is confusing. Also, the
descriptions in the caption of what is actually being plotted on each topology are rather unclear.
In figure 1, reduce Phylogeny in B to only the taxa in A. This will highlight the movement of
Squalus deeper in the phylogeny and better show that the two phylogenies are basically
congruent except for the position of Squalus. The mapping onto the phylogeny is also not done
with any kind of attempt at ancestral state reconstruction. The authors want to infer and do in
several places what the ancestral state might be. This type of ancestral reconstruction in many
cases is quite ambiguous but if the transformation of traits and ancestral states is going to be
discussed a more modern effort must be made to reconstruct these traits in the common ancestors
of the sharks.
The contrast between the adult and embryonic tooth evolutionary patterns on the
phylogeny seem really unclear to me. The caption of the figure should better summarize what we
should be inferring from these comparisons.
The specimens studied and individuals examined should be placed in a table.
Figures 4-7 are not all necessary. The many panels and the total numbers of figures should be
substantially reduced. Currently, there are so many panels that they are confusing and not
providing greater insight into the evolution of the dentitions.

figure 9, the plotting of different traits on different phylogenetic topologies is confusing. Also, the
descriptions in the caption of what is actually being plotted on each topology are rather unclear.
In figure 1, reduce Phylogeny in B to only the taxa in A. This will highlight the movement of
Squalus deeper in the phylogeny and better show that the two phylogenies are basically
congruent except for the position of Squalus. The mapping onto the phylogeny is also not done
with any kind of attempt at ancestral state reconstruction. The authors want to infer and do in
several places what the ancestral state might be. This type of ancestral reconstruction in many
cases is quite ambiguous but if the transformation of traits and ancestral states is going to be
discussed a more modern effort must be made to reconstruct these traits in the common ancestors
of the sharks.
The contrast between the adult and embryonic tooth evolutionary patterns on the
phylogeny seem really unclear to me. The caption of the figure should better summarize what we
should be inferring from these comparisons.
The specimens studied and individuals examined should be placed in a table.
12
Figures 4-7 are not all necessary. The many panels and the total numbers of figures should be
substantially reduced. Currently, there are so many panels that they are confusing and not
providing greater insight into the evolution of the dentitions.

The manuscript "Cutting blade dentitions in squaliform sharks form by
modification of inherited alternate tooth ordering patterns" provides some interesting
information on shark dentitions. I reviewed an earlier version of this manuscript and the current
form is improved. However, I feel that the manuscript remains too narrowly focused
13
scientifically as well as being too filled with jargon, the use of embryos is poorly justified, and the
writing in general is hard to read.
Although it is improved over the first time I read the manuscript, this work still suffers from
being written with too narrow of a focus to be of general interest. What does the evolution and
diversity of these dentitions tell us outside of teeth in sharks? Does it have relevance to
patterning of iterative structures generally? What about feather, scales, or even leaves? The
manuscript is all too filled with jargon both about sharks and about dentitions. There are
numerous words that, although defined, are difficult to keep straight, and there are further
instance of language that will be difficult but for the most diehard shark dental researchers to
comprehend. For instance, on line 240 The term “dignathic heterodonty” comes out of nowhere.
This is one of many instances of writing that seems too jargony for a more generalized journal.
A motivation for the examination of embryos should be given at the beginning of the Materials
and Methods and it would be good if there was some reference to why embryonic dentitions are
good to study in the Introduction. Why embryos? It seems like their teeth could be
fundamentally different than adults. With continuous replacement in sharks it seems like the
embryo dentition could differ wildly from the adult dentition. Is there any evidence to suggest
that they do not? The next paragraph suggest 20 additional species were studied. Were they
embryos or adults? What is the motivation for choosing these species? Was it random, do they
encompass all of the diversity of this group, or were they just available?
I often find that reading manuscripts aloud makes difficult writing much easier to improve and
subsequently for readers to follow. I know this will seem a little didactic coming from a reviewer
and if I got the same comment I might not do it because it sounds snarky, but I would challenge
at least the lead author to read this manuscript aloud. I feel like it would fundamentally help how
this manuscript is written. Regardless, something here needs to be changed as the writing is often
very difficult to follow. Additionally, several of the phrases used such as Line 105: “in addition
to dentitions” sounds like a bad mouthful when it is read. I think this phrase generally reads
terribly and there are others that could easily be improved if they were heard by a discriminating
ear.

Editor Comments to Author (Professor Kevin Padian):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
I am very interested in this manuscript and I would like to see the authors have enough time
to answer the concerns of the reviewer, so for this reason I recommend to reject and allow re-
submission rather than hold them to the strict time-line of a "revise." I understand many of the
reviewer's concerns, but I think that the authors could make a case that small sample or size
differences may not invalidate their conclusions.
We did not make the sample size clear and did not indicate that there are a number of
specimens and scans that were not figured. The ‘materials and methods’ section has now been
expanded and all scanned specimens listed.
To me, the strongest argument would be to map these ontogenetic changes on phylogenies a
bit more clearly than they are now done.
We have expanded the main phylogeny diagrams and made alterations to the text accordingly,
including adding an additional section to the discussion.
There is a lot of taxonomic and developmental information for a reader to absorb (especially a
non-specialist in sharks) and the authors' points could be made more accessible with a couple
of explicit diagrams of how things change phylogenetically and ontogenetically.
We can see this as a potential issue, and a new summary diagram has been added.
Selfishly, I am always looking for good 3x2 diagrams of concepts to put into the ppts that I
show my vertebrate evolution classes! But I also think this paper could be better appreciated
with a bit more graphical information.
We hope there is something here you can make use of.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript provides an analysis of the tooth development of various sharks with a
special focus on Squaliforms, a peculiar clade gathering most of the deep sea sharks having
an unusual cutting blade dentitions compared to most of the elasmobranchs. This kind of
study is desperately needed as current knowledge on elasmobranch tooth development. In
addition, this study also tackles the possible mechanic (as modification of inherited alternate
tooth ordering patterns usually observed in other sharks and batoids) and phylogenetic
backgrounds that lead to the observed distribution of tooth development among the Squalean
taxa analyzed. So, this is an interesting work on the teeth development of elasmobranchs,
with particular emphasis on Squalus, one of the more studied Squaliforms.
However it will be worth publishing with revisions I consider as major. Of particular
concerns are the lack of methodology to compare tooth pattern of embryos (without no clear
idea about stage of development or TL size)
Sizes of all specimens (and estimated size of one that was dissected) have now been added
, the reduced number of very relevant specimens (only 2 embryos of S. acanthias with
probable different ages and thus developmental stages) compared to other mature embryos or
adults without age and/or without strong interest, and the use of very partial phylogeny that
forms the basis of some of their major conclusions.
We are not in complete agreement that only the specimens of S. acanthias were completely
relevant, we did however not make the number of specimens and scans clear and now have
listed these, which include 8 scans of 4 specimens of 3 species of Squalus alone. In addition,
unlike Scyliorhinus and rajids, Squalus cannot be reared to order as they are live bearing, and
there is a limitation on the number of specimens of any species suitable for scanning present
in museum collections.
If the authors' introduction scientifically sound and highlights clearly the goal of
developmental studies in elasmobranchs to identify shared pattern characters for the
vertebrate dentition as a whole (abstract and introduction), the issues raised should be toned
down because the results remain extremely qualitative, subjective and must be focused on
difference between the first development states in tooth pattern between Squalus and
Pristiophorids, only. If the inadequacy of the Squaliform tooth data set to say anything
meaningful, the issues suffer from lack of significant results to make some of the statements
in the final conclusion.
Whilst we disagree with this statement, a new diagram has been added to improve clarity.
Text relating to this topic has been restructured to improve clarity.
First of all, I think the manuscript will gain in clarity if they really discuss about the
uncertainties concerning the phylogenetic relationships of Squalea and Squaliforms
(sometimes including Echinorhinids) in Introduction. That would be much more logical and
easier to read. For instance, they clearly report that the monophyly of Squalea is not subject to
caution but they omitted to report in fig 1 (and last figure 8) the other major clades
(Hexanchiforms, Echinorhinids, Chlamydoselachids and Squatinid) which contribute to root
the Squalea/Galea node. But more consistent, I would also like the authors to
explain (especially in discussion) why they exclude all these previous clades in their
inferences, especially when these last ones share very differents morphologies that possibly
valid or invalid their model of modification of inherited alternate tooth ordering pattern. In
fact, they chose to use a partial phylogenetic framework without any comments about the
uncertainties concerning all the unstudied taxa.
This is not a taxonomic work and we consider that detailed discussions of phylogeny are
beyond the scope of this project. We have used the two most recent and comprehensive
molecular phylogenies available and have now expanded the diagrams to show other squalean
outgroups mentioned in the text. We are aware that a very major study, involving multiple
gene loci, is nearing completion and feel that discussions of older and soon to be redundant
phylogenies is not a productive use of publication space. Despite this, there is discussion of
the phylogeny within the squaliforms in reference to parsimony of tooth development.
The second major disagreement concerns the methodology and data set used in
developmental study. The authors deal with two embryos from S. acanthias (without length
size) one from a Squalus sp. (120mm TL but unusable picture 5H),
We consider that these pictures are the best that it is possible to obtain, and are the result of
multiple scans and applications of several different rendering softwares. We have digitally
enhanced fig 7G and have added an explanation of the methodiology. One assumes that the
author is unfamiliar with rendering CT scans of material of this type.
one from D. calcea (without size), one from C. coelolepis (mature specimen?), one of E.
spinax (without size and unusable picture on fig. 4E and 7G), and one of Pristiophorus
cirratus and attempt to derive evolutionary implications from these. But there is no mention of
which development states or at least size the observed embryos are (except such term as
mature or not)?
A table of specimens and scans has now been added.
Authors used the SAT number (l.150) of specimen to have idea of relative stage of
development. My concern is that these relative age between different taxa could merely
represent ontogenetic variation within taxa. Moreover authors reports latter (l. 452-455) that
the number of replacement tooth rows is constant throughout ontogeny in Etmopetus, one of
Squaliforms observed? So I don’t understand how authors can use SAT number as relative
developmental stage between different taxa if this doesn’t change with growth in
one… Many other statement are really unclear as for instance l. 327-330,”in the less
developed specimen [ S. acanthias SAT6] six tooth row are represented near the symphysis
but teeth representing up to eleven rows are present in more proximal position (fig. 6G-H)”. I
don’t see no more than 6 proximal rows on fig. 6 G-H? (but in fig. 6b, F).
We have removed SAT number as an indicator of development and used other criteria. It have
been explicitly pointed out that the number of poorly mineralized developing teeth seen partly
depends on the optimizing rendering methods; renders showing even the most poorly
mineralized structures are often unsuitable for other purposes due to ‘noise’ and so different
renders may show different tooth counts.
The third major disagreement is that we have no information about when and how the
alternate pattern (observable on the three embryos of Squalus) becomes oblique to form the
peculiar cutting blade with interlocked teeth in adults ? This is a major point to discuss but it
is resumed in line 380-392 by a short assumption (“by modification of the alternate
developmental pattern”) without any other evidences or observations? Rest of the
observations (8. Tooth development in other squaliforms l.394-461) do not allow to resolve
this and many results remain extremely qualitative and subjective.
We consider that this is clearly demonstrated, but have added a diagram to make it clearer.
For instance, in Deania embryo (fig. 5I-J) authors claim that the “alternate pattern is evident
in upper jaw” (l. 404)
Figure 5 has been changes to make this more evident
despite that there is “relatively few teeth that could be recognized” (l.403). Nothing is evident
on fig. 5J (upper jaw) but in lower dentition, this is not the case and teeth are aligned in clear
parallel rows, as in adults. Reality is that the development stage of observed embryo of
Deania is probably too mature to have any idea about how the cutting blade is developing.
This is not the case. The Deania is at a stage where teeth are only starting to mineralize and
none have yet reached the jaw margin. The size and developmental stage of specimens is now
listed.
It is exactly the same case with the lower jaw of “mature” embryo of C. coelolepis (fig. 7A-F)
and moreover I don’t understand the assumption of authors when they argue that (l. 426-) “the
first tooth row is present on the jaw margin but have not yet reached functional position […]
as teeth are not shed until replacement teeth are functional position, it is evident that no older
tooth row had been present and subsequently lost” It’s a meaningless assumption because: 1.
it is a mature embryo 2. If an alternate pattern really precede the oblique one in squaliforms
(the aim of this work), teeth are continually shed before to be functional as a blade and thus,
those observed on jaw margin can be the last row with alternate pattern?
We are not quite sure what this is suggesting. The use of the term ‘mature’ is misleading and
has been removed, and more explanation is given of the stage of dental development of the
specimen. We have clarified the section on development (lines 130-140).
Other example of disagreement, authors remark (l. 438-440) that the upper teeth “appear to
show an alternate pattern but degree of resolution and strong curvature of the jaws make
difficult to assess”. It ‘is a bit superficial, especially when they use it in final conclusions.
They remove the artefacts of jaw curvature for Squalus, they can do it for C. coelepis too.
Whilst this would be possible, the resolution of the scan data and low degree of
mineralization of the teeth would render this difficult and more importantly very prone to
adding of artifacts. The reviewer may not be familiar with CT scan data and rendering and
their limitations. This is now explained in the text.
The same insubstantial arguments were developed with E. spinax (eg. l.460-461 “the relative
position […] suggests that the upper teeth are arranged in alternate pattern” and those, despite
that the “upper teeth are far less well resolved” (fig. 7G). Finally authors (Part 9 Interpretation
of tooth development in heterodont squaliforms) summarized all these very questionable
observations in Squaliforms to conclude that (l. 489-490) “it is probable that the embryonic
alternate stage of tooth development as seen in Squalus […] do not occur in these taxa.”
Final discussions (part 11-12.) is of the same kind, mixing some real observations
(comparison Pristiophorus /Squalus) and very questionable statements (e.g. l. 524-525)
“upper dentition of embryonic and adult Centroscymnus and Etmopterus clearly shows an
alternate pattern”(see remarks before).
The images are rendered to their fullest extent and we would say that an alternate pattern, as
seen in the adult, is very obvious. Other changes to the figures mentioned elsewhere should
resolve this
Some other issues raised should be toned down regarding the real results of their analysis (e.g.
l 565-567 “Examination of squalean embryonic dentition has revealed that a single file tooth
pattern is not generated from these types of identical tooth file but from modification of an
alternate pattern”
I think there is no doubt that the alternate pattern is the plesiomorphic state in elasmobranchs,
being present in all batoids and galeans (discussion about lamniforms notwithstanding) as
well as all articulated hybodont and ctenacanth dentitions observed by us.
Against that background, the Such assumption is free , there is no regard about other
Squalean as Hexanchids, Echinorhinids, unobserved Squaliforms and more exasperating,
It was mentioned why these were not discussed and now we have added that they are
currently under investigation, and whilst they may show other states or processes, cannot see
how this could impact on the conclusions drawn here
in contradiction with the observations of analyzed Squaliforms (Centroscymnus-Etmopterus)
where there are a single file tooth pattern in lower jaws of embryos…). These omissions are
striking in fig. 8. If we plot their models onto a more complete phylogenetic tree (including
basal squalea as Hexanchids, Echinorhinids, Chlamydoselachidis and Squatinids), the final
signal is a bit more questionable or at least more complex… I am surprised that the authors do
not discuss about this.
Whilst this is the eventual aim of the authors, dental development within these additional
squalean taxa (as well as the lamniforms within the galea) is very difficult to assess, as
mentioned in the text. We have now added in the text that work on these taxa is currently
underway.
My view is that the submitted manuscript contains significant weaknesses in the data and the
analysis, such that they provide only weak support for the results and interpretations, thus
reducing much of the discussion to many speculations. I have not provided an annotated pdf
of the ms. Some of other remarks I have are trivial ["Dalatias" and not "Dalatius" in whole
text; Check figure captions 1 [which is A and B] and 8 [what’s meaning C and D]
Corrected
; there are also no clear links between all the figures and the text, which makes the latter
difficult to read. Some of them can be removed (e.g. fig. 4E-G = fig. 7G-I) or at least deeply
reduced (e.g. fig. 4a-D, fig7A-F).
These have been changed as new data was added to the main text. We do not see any
redundancy in the figures now present; some are essential for contextural relationships.
The use of Proximal/distal (l. 171-172) terms (e.g. Underwood et al., 2015 and this MS) is a
bit confusing with the dental terminology used to describe isolated tooth in many works, this
one included (Pages 8-11 of the MS where authors described the tooth morphology with
distal/mesial vs. distal = toward the jaw joint (commissural)/ mesial = toward the symphysis
(symphyseal).
We are aware of the issues regarding terminology but concluded that retaining a consistent
terminology for all studies of dental development was preferable even if this means using
terminology not commonly (but established in the literature by Underwood et al 2015) used
for chondrichthyes. A further part of the section explaining the terminology has been added.
Appendix B
The manuscript by Underwood et al. is a thorough and interesting study and
analysis of the evolution and development of cutting blade dentitions in a group of
sharks. It is beautifully illustrated. Tooth development in a number of taxa was
examined using a diversity of techniques. Analyzed (in part) with regard to explicit
phylogenetic hypotheses (competing, but of course not resolved by the tooth data),
the introduction to shark dentitions is useful, as is the discussion of tooth
arrangements in sharks and especially the list of terms used; it potentially can be
employed by other researchers doing similar research on tooth development and
replacement. The thoughtful discussions of the functions of different patterns, and
what would/would not be optimal given modifications of those patterns, is fruit for
both the authors’ analysis of the evolution and development of the Squalus pattern,
and their conjectures about form and function in other groups. The discussion of
tooth form and the dental lamina is particularly interesting, and will lead to further
research. The descriptions of tooth development, alternate and otherwise, tie the
blade-like form in terms of development and function, etc. I am fascinated by the
discussion, and all the questions that it opens. I am frustrated that it doesn’t seem to
go far enough, especially in terms of explicit data on both replacement patterns and
functional properties of the teeth. But I found the ms well prepared, a useful
description of aspects of tooth development in sharks, and a stimulating prospectus
for further research. The authors have articulated the several “pieces of the
problem”, and I expect interesting new data to emerge, given the broad framework
and background that they have provided.
An aspect of this presentation that puzzles me, given that much of the analysis and
discussion deals with comparisons of tooth replacement patterns in different shark
clades, is the absence of any attempt to assess the shark tooth patterns in the
context of the extensive literature on tooth replacement in squamates and in
amphibians, and in some fishes—analyses, terminologies, and recently the genetics
of development and replacement (especially out of Richman’s lab) abound. The
“older” literature that dealt with alternate “waves”, fields vs. clones, etc., and shapes
and patterns (see Whitlock, Rieppel (recent and fossil taxa), Cooper, Osborn,
Edmund, and others for reptiles; David-Beal, Lawson, Wake(s), Gillette, and others
for amphibians (Bolt for fossils); and Berkovitz, Evans, Shellis, Miller, and, recently,
Bemis for fishes) is most useful, and has import both for terminology and analysis,
and for development and evolution. I know that the authors are aware of this
literature, but I don’t find it well explored in their previous papers, either. They
could fill this gap easily and succinctly, I believe, and it would be a service to all
researchers on tooth development and replacement. This ms may not be the place
for a full treatment, but some allusion to the scope of the research field and problem
would be appropriate.
Dear Editors,
Please find attached a revised version of the manuscript entitled “Cutting blade dentitions in squaliform
sharks form by modification of inherited alternate tooth ordering patterns” by Zerina Johanson, Moya
Smith and I. We consider that this should now be be highly appropriate as a Research Article for Royal
Society Open Science.
Yours sincerely

Reviewer 2.
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript “Cutting blade dentitions in squaliform sharks form by modification of inherited alternate
tooth ordering patterns” provides interesting insight into the evolution of shark dentitions. I think this
study provides valuable data but it is currently not structured very well. Below are a number of
suggestions to improve how the manuscript could be put together in a more rigorous and exciting
manner.
The abstract does not provide a good comprehensive overview of what data is presented in the paper.
We have edited the abstract to make the content clearer. We consider though that some aspects of the
paper, such as terminology, are best not included in the abstract as they are peripheral to the main
point of the paper but essential for internal consistency.
The paper really needs to be contextualized outside of shark dentitions. It is really unclear why we want
to know about what data is presented.
We have expanded the “discussion” section and have inserted a section placing this work in a larger
context. Also see below in reply to Reviewer 3.
The questions being asked in the paper are not clearly defined early in the Introduction. The beginning
of the introduction talks a lot about shark diversity and it is unclear where the paper is headed. Stating
the hypotheses to be addressed early on would help focus the Introduction. Additionally, some attempt
should be made to broaden the inferences made in this study to other studies of vertebrate teeth or
other structures.
An additional paragraph has been inserted to aid clarity here and introducing the problem. This is also
covered to some extent elsewhere in the text. As we consider this work (as also implied by reviewer 3)
to be of wide interest, we feel that it is essential that the general context within shark biology is made
clear from the outset, especially in light of the discussions at the end of the paper.
The use of the term “developmental plasticity” in this study as in page 3 line 58 could cause confusion. I
think a term like evolutionary lability would be more appropriate as the study is not really concentrating
on what happens during the single lifetime of an individual.
We have simplified the terminology here.
I think the mapping of the traits onto a phylogeny needs to be done much more rigorously. In figure 9,
the plotting of different traits on different phylogenetic topologies is confusing. Also, the descriptions in
the caption of what is actually being plotted on each topology are rather unclear. In figure 1, reduce
Phylogeny in B to only the taxa in A. This will highlight the movement of Squalus deeper in the
phylogeny and better show that the two phylogenies are basically congruent except for the position of
Squalus. The mapping onto the phylogeny is also not done with any kind of attempt at ancestral state
reconstruction. The authors want to infer and do in several places what the ancestral state might be.
This type of ancestral reconstruction in many cases is quite ambiguous but if the transformation of traits
and ancestral states is going to be discussed a more modern effort must be made to reconstruct these
traits in the common ancestors of the sharks.
The contrast between the adult and embryonic tooth evolutionary patterns on the phylogeny seem really
unclear to me. The caption of the figure should better summarize what we should be inferring from
these comparisons.
We have changed both of the diagrams containing phylogenies to simplify them but still retain context
where it is needed. In Figure 1 all of the taxa included are mentioned in the text and there is thus a
the text for clarity.
Fugure 9 has been reduced to only include taxa covered in this study and the outgroups mentioned in
other publications. In this we agree with the reviewer that the overall figure is far simpler and removes
the taxa with doubtful status.
The specimens studied and individuals examined should be placed in a table.
We have moved these to a new table as suggested.
Figures 4-7 are not all necessary. The many panels and the total numbers of figures should be
substantially reduced. Currently, there are so many panels that they are confusing and not providing
greater insight into the evolution of the dentitions.
We have made some changes to the figures but not significantly reduced them. We have replaced some
old figures with a new one of Scyliorhinus to show the general form of shark tooth replacement. Other
than that we consider that the images are all useful or critical to the story. This is especially true bearing
n mind the comments of reviewer 3 who implied that this paper would be useful for non specialists. As a
result we consider that images of general dentitions of the taxa under consideration are invaluable to
non-chondrichthyan specialists to get an idea of context. We consider that images of the dentitions
within the developing heads of several taxa are useful for context but more significantly are critical to
the discussions in the text on the relative rate of development of skeletal characters (which enhances
the relevance of this work) and also the discussion on the importance of cutting dentitions relative to a
poorly mineralized neurocranium. All of the images in Figure 6 are essential for the discussion that forms
the core of this study.
Reviewer 3.
We are happy that this reviewer was so strongly supportive of the paper and seemed to consider it
widely applicable. As a result we feel justified in retaining contextural images that will open up the
readership of this to developmental biologists unfamiliar with sharks, ichthyologists unfamiliar with tooth
development and evolutionary biologists/palaeontologists unfamiliar with shark anatomy.
We agree that the wider context of this paper should be discussed. We have inserted a new section in
the “Discussions” and added some review papers (20, 22). We did not expand this to include too much
work on other clades as we considered that this might unbalance the work and detract from the main
thrust. This is not intended as the concluding study on shark dental development, and indeed we are
curentluy working on bringing together data of all chondrichthyan clades for that purpose.

e must say that we were rather surprised by the reviewer comments,
ich conflict with some of the previous reviewers who thought our
nuscript was interesting and well-written. We have made the specific
anges requested (see below) but despite extensive thought we are
certain as to how to tackle much of the review and is if you consider
t we have not responded correctly would like appreciate some
itorial guidance.
Some of the comments refer to an absence of explanation or Formatted: Indent: First line: 0.2"
lusion in the text of content that is both included and explicit. Others
mments are so vague as to be impossible to counter without more
planation from the reviewer. We have already inserted a review of the
ationship between the findings of this study and studies elsewhere in
th-bearing vertebrates, as requested by a previous reviewer.
mparison to other animal, and plant, structures we can only see as
mpletely irrelevant as they are in no way related to the teeth of sharks.
There is mention of the work being “jargony”. This has not been
ought up by previous reviews and we cannot find any terminology
ed here that is not in common usage to vertebrate workers, or is not
plained in detail here.
Finally there is a rather bizarre mention of writing style. Again this has
t been raised previously, and none of us can find any phraseology
s that we do not consider clear; indeed the authors have published
ny papers with this (or similar) writing style, again without comment,
d it is likely that all of the phrases used here have been used
eviously elsewhere. To be honest, we found the suggestion to “read
nuscripts aloud” somewhat insulting.
We have made a large number of minor changes to the writing style
ot highlighted). We are unsure as to whether this is what was wanted,
d it probably does little more than change the writing style of one
thor to that of another.

mments to the Author(s)
e manuscript "Cutting blade dentitions in squaliform sharks form by
dification of inherited alternate tooth ordering patterns" provides
me interesting information on shark dentitions. I reviewed an earlier
rsion of this manuscript and the current form is improved. However, I
l that the manuscript remains too narrowly focused scientifically as
ll as being too filled with jargon, the use of embryos is poorly justified,
d the writing in general is hard to read.
hough it is improved over the first time I read the manuscript, this
rk still suffers from being written with too narrow of a focus to be of
neral interest. What does the evolution and diversity of these
ntitions tell us outside of teeth in sharks? Does it have relevance to
tterning of iterative structures generally? What about feather, scales,
even leaves?
m sorry but we are at a complete loss to know how to respond to this;
have included a wider contextural review of shark teeth with the
rtebrates as requested previously, so this statement is incorrect and
the large part has already been addressed. As for the latter part
ather, scales, or even leaves” we can see no way to incorporate a
cussion of structures that bear no structural, developmental,
ological or evolutionary relationship to that under discussion.
e manuscript is all too filled with jargon both about sharks and about
ntitions. There are numerous words that, although defined, are
ficult to keep straight, and there are further instance of language that
l be difficult but for the most diehard shark dental researchers to
mprehend. For instance, on line 240 The term “dignathic heterodonty”
mes out of nowhere.
far as we are aware this is a standard term used in dental studies
ross the gnathostomes; squaliform heterodonty is explained in detail
ew paragraphs later. We have inserted a ‘plain English’ explanation.
is is one of many instances of writing that seems too jargony for a
re generalized journal.
is statement comes out of nowhere with no examples given; there is
mention of this in previous reviews. Reading throught we can find no
minology that is not widely used and would not be either recognizable
anyone with a reasonable knowledge of vertebrate anatomy or are
t explained in depth here. Is this suggesting, for example, the that we
e “the cartilage that forms the lower jaw in gnathostomes and is
ained as the lower jaw structure in chondrichthyans” rather than
eckel’s cartilage”? . Indeed we have inserted a section on
minology in order to make sure there is consistency between the use
re and the understanding of the reader.
motivation for the examination of embryos should be given at the
ginning of the Materials and Methods and it would be good if there
s some reference to why embryonic dentitions are good to study in
Introduction. Why embryos?
is is explained in lines 104-110.
eems like their teeth could be fundamentally different than adults.
th continuous replacement in sharks it seems like the embryo
ntition could differ wildly from the adult dentition. Is there any
idence to suggest that they do not?
at is the main investigation of the study and the results explained at
gth>>.What more can we say?
e next paragraph suggest 20 additional species were studied. Were
y embryos or adults?
de clear in the text. We though this would be implicit from the
ntion of embryos separately.
hat is the motivation for choosing these species? Was it random, do
y encompass all of the diversity of this group, or were they just
ailable?
de clear in the text. Available; wWe used probably the most
tensive collection of dried squaliform jaws in the UK, and observed all
ecies present.
ften find that reading manuscripts aloud makes difficult writing much
sier to improve and subsequently for readers to follow. I know this will
em a little didactic coming from a reviewer and if I got the same
mment I might not do it because it sounds snarky, but I would
allenge at least the lead author to read this manuscript aloud. I feel
e it would fundamentally help how this manuscript is written.
gardless, something here needs to be changed as the writing is often
ry difficult to follow. Additionally, several of the phrases used such as
e 105: “in addition to dentitions” sounds like a bad mouthful when it is
ad. I think this phrase generally reads terribly and there are others
t could easily be improved if they were heard by a discriminating ear.
