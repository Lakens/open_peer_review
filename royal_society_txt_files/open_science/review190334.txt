Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I previously reviewed this same manuscript to another Journal. Again, I still see that the
manuscript by Cunze et al. presents an interesting work on leishmaniasis in Eurasia and Africa.
The authors clearly stated the objectives of their study to compare the geographical distributions
of Phlebotomus vector species and their corresponding pathogens. The manuscript is in the line
with these objectives and therefore represents a valuable contribution in the field of vector and
distributional ecology. So, I see that the manuscript is worth to be published; many
improvements were considered to the original version I reviewed previously for another Journal.
Finally, my decision remains the same to my previous one and I strongly recommend the
manuscript for publication in your Journal after considering some concerns that I will detail
below:
- Line 31-34: The vector incrimination requires other factors to be considered before drawing a
similar conclusion. So, I would kindly ask the author to change this piece to reflect only their
finding based on a single factor of vector incrimination (co-occurrence/co-existence of both
vector and pathogen in question).
- Line 63: Add “as one of the vector incrimination criteria adopted by WHO [3]”.
- Line 75: This assumption is incorrectly stated; as I mentioned previously don't get yourself into
such debates in this era. I would suggest the authors to use the previous literature to reflect that
one of the reasons to exclude reservoirs in their analyses is the much broader ranges for these
hosts (ref. 15 in your list “https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004381” and
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.08.014).
- Line 82: Change “Lybia” to “Libya”.
- Line 106-113: Cite supplementary materials in the text, particularly data used for modeling
Phlebotomus spp.
- Line 116: Change “5 arc minutes” to “30 arc-seconds”.
- Line 244: AUC is longer a sensitive tool to evaluate model robustness (see Lobo et al. 2008, and
Peterson et al. 2008). Authors should consider a more robust tool to evaluate their models; you
may use PartialROC (Peterson et al. 2008) or an independent set of records if available. I am
aware that you placed great efforts on your analyses, so, I suggest to add a paragraph that place
all study limitations together in the discussion and include this one as one of these limitations.
- Line 115—127: The environmental data used for the niche modeling analyses were limited and
missing important variables, for example, EVI, and soil factors that are available for present-day
conditions which are the main interest of this study. Thanks to the authors to include the
statement on line 128-129; however, these factors are still important to estimate the ecological
niches of these species. Please outline this one in the limitation section I previously referred (see
my previous comment).
- Line 130-134: Several improvements have been introduced to the field of ecological modeling.
These improvements solved some problems associated with species distribution modeling,
particularly in the case of Maxent. None of these were considered in this analysis; estimating
accessible area for model calibration of the species in question (See Barve et al. 2011 and Owens et
al. 2013); some of these species have limited distribution to Europe, so, calibrating these models
should be limited to areas accessible for the species (M component of the BAM diagram). Please
consider adding this item to the limitations section.
- The limitations paragraph on line 338-348 marks an improvement for this manuscript version,
so, I would suggest adding all missed items that I referred previously in my review.

Comments to the Author:
This paper uses GIS to model the relationships between Leishmania parasite species and their
sandfly vector species and to identify any mismatches based on known and expected (based on
climate) occurrence data of parasite/vector pairs. This manuscript provides a thoughtful
synthesis, discussion, and visualization of some complex data and the map figures are really well
done.
I am not familiar with the Maxent software and defer to the two reviewers who had several
insightful comments. Both pointed out limitations and recent improvements to Maxent, which, if
you are not able to address through your analysis, should be described in the text so that readers
know of those limitations.
Below are a few minor comments and suggestions on word choice:
Line 90. delete comma after the word “areas”
Line 126. First mention of Maxent here, but it is not described until line 130. Please correct.
Line 168. Replace “few” with “limited”
Line 206. I’m not sure that “exemplary” is the word you are looking for here. Maybe re-write this
first sentence and say why you focused specifically on L. donovani and its associated vector
species?
Line 283. I would insert “a” before species and add an “s” to the word “area” in the next line.
Line 291. Replace “and due to” with “or”
Line 304. I don’t think “monotonously” is the word you mean here. Maybe “….the niches of the
second group, including L donovani, show optima at warmer temperatures”
Line 310. Change to “covers and extends beyond the known pathogen distribution.” And delete
“and goes further beyond”
Line 357. Maybe change “inappropriate” to “incomplete”?

Comments to the Author(s)
I previously reviewed this same manuscript to another Journal. Again, I still see that the
manuscript by Cunze et al. presents an interesting work on leishmaniasis in Eurasia and Africa.
The authors clearly stated the objectives of their study to compare the geographical distributions
7
of Phlebotomus vector species and their corresponding pathogens. The manuscript is in the line
with these objectives and therefore represents a valuable contribution in the field of vector and
distributional ecology. So, I see that the manuscript is worth to be published; many
improvements were considered to the original version I reviewed previously for another Journal.
Finally, my decision remains the same to my previous one and I strongly recommend the
manuscript for publication in your Journal after considering some concerns that I will detail
below:
- Line 31-34: The vector incrimination requires other factors to be considered before drawing a
similar conclusion. So, I would kindly ask the author to change this piece to reflect only their
finding based on a single factor of vector incrimination (co-occurrence/co-existence of both
vector and pathogen in question).
- Line 63: Add “as one of the vector incrimination criteria adopted by WHO [3]”.

one of the reasons to exclude reservoirs in their analyses is the much broader ranges for these

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.08.014).
- Line 82: Change “Lybia” to “Libya”.
- Line 106-113: Cite supplementary materials in the text, particularly data used for modeling
Phlebotomus spp.
- Line 116: Change “5 arc minutes” to “30 arc-seconds”.
- Line 244: AUC is longer a sensitive tool to evaluate model robustness (see Lobo et al. 2008, and
Peterson et al. 2008). Authors should consider a more robust tool to evaluate their models; you
may use PartialROC (Peterson et al. 2008) or an independent set of records if available. I am
aware that you placed great efforts on your analyses, so, I suggest to add a paragraph that place
all study limitations together in the discussion and include this one as one of these limitations.
- Line 115—127: The environmental data used for the niche modeling analyses were limited and
missing important variables, for example, EVI, and soil factors that are available for present-day
conditions which are the main interest of this study. Thanks to the authors to include the

niches of these species. Please outline this one in the limitation section I previously referred (see
my previous comment).
- Line 130-134: Several improvements have been introduced to the field of ecological modeling.
These improvements solved some problems associated with species distribution modeling,
particularly in the case of Maxent. None of these were considered in this analysis; estimating
accessible area for model calibration of the species in question (See Barve et al. 2011 and Owens et
al. 2013); some of these species have limited distribution to Europe, so, calibrating these models
should be limited to areas accessible for the species (M component of the BAM diagram). Please
consider adding this item to the limitations section.
- The limitations paragraph on line 338-348 marks an improvement for this manuscript version,
so, I would suggest adding all missed items that I referred previously in my review.

4
5
6 24 Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease with a broad global occurrence and an increasing number
7
8
9 25 of recorded cases; however, it is still one of the world’s most neglected diseases. We here provide
10
11 26 climatic suitability maps generated by means of an ecological niche modelling approach for 32
12
13 27 Phlebotomus vector species with proven or suspected vector competence for five Leishmania
14
15
16 28 pathogens occurring in Eurasia and Africa. A GIS-based spatial overlay analysis was then used to
17
18 29 compare the distributional patterns of vectors and pathogens to help evaluate the vector species-
19
20 30 pathogen-relationship currently found in the literature. Most of the pathogens occurred with at
21
22
23
31 least one of the associated vector species. In the case of L. donovani, only a not yet confirmed
24
25 32 vector species, P. rodhaini, could explain the occurrence of the pathogen in regions of Africa.
26
27 33 Phlebotomus alexandri and Phlebotomus longiductus on the other hand, proven vector species of
28
29 34 L. donovani, do not seem to qualify as vectors for the pathogen. Their distribution is restricted to
30
31
32 35 northern latitudes and does not match the pathogen’s distribution, which lies in southern latitudes.
33
34 36 Other more locally confined mismatches were discussed for each pathogen species respectively.
35
36 37 The comparative geographical GIS-overlay of vector species and pathogens functions as a first
37
38
39 38 indication that testing and re-evaluation of some pathogen-vector relationships might be
40
41 39 worthwhile to improve risk assessments of leishmaniasis.

3 41 Introduction
4

6
42
7
8
9 43 Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease with a broad global distribution and an increasing
10
11 44 number of recorded cases worldwide [1,2]. However, it is still one of the world’s most neglected
12
13 45 diseases [3]. Over the last decades the disease has been found to expand geographically with a
14
15
16 46 global increase of cases of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis [4] increasing the public health
17
18 47 problems associated with the disease epidemics. The reported range expansion of the diseases has
19
20 48 been associated with range expansions of vector populations in response to climate change [5].
21
22
23
49 Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. The transmission can
24
25 50 either be zoonotic and/or anthroponotic through the bite of an infected female phlebotomine
26
27 51 sandfly [6]. In Eurasia and Africa, all vector-competent sandfly species belong to the genus
28
29 52 Phlebotomus [7]. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of leishmaniasis. In
30
31
32 53 the “old world” , it is caused by five currently recognized Leishmania species: L. infantum, L.
33
34 54 tropica, L. major, L. aethiopica and L. donovani. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), another common
35
36 55 and more severe form of leishmaniasis, is only associated to the Leishmania species L. infantum
37
38
39 56 and L. donovani [8–11]. The specific Leishmania species cause different clinical symptoms in
40
41 57 humans [12,13].
42
43
44 58 A successful transmission requires presence of pathogen, vector, and host species [14]. Thus,
45
46 59 when estimating disease risk the occurrence of the vector species in addition to the distributions
47
48
49 60 of the disease-causing pathogen and the host species are of major importance (see [14,15]). For a
50
51 61 better understanding of the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, comparisons between the
52
53 62 geographical distributions of vectors, pathogens, and disease cases using geographical
54
55
56
63 information systems (GIS) have been suggested as very valuable [3].

3 64 Another important component required for the completion of the Leishmania life cycle is the
4
5
6
65 reservoir host [15]. Generally, the pathogen-vector-reservoir host relations are rather complex
7
8 66 and have been shown to vary regionally and temporally. Several species, from small to large,
9
10 67 wild, domestic and synanthropic mammals have been reported as reservoir hosts for Leishmania
11
12
68 spp., among them rock hyraxes (especially for the Indian subcontinent with India, Nepal,
13
14
15 69 Bangladesh and east Africa with Ethiopia, Kenya), rodents, foxes, dogs, cats, and other domestic
16
17 70 animals [6]. Among the five Leishmania species considered here, L. donovani and L. tropica are
18
19 71 assumed to be anthroponotic with humans as reservoir hosts, having human-to-human
20
21
22 72 transmission through the vector, but there is some evidence for the possible involvement of
23
24 73 zoonotic transmission as well [6]. Although the presence or absence of reservoirs is crucial for
25
26 74 the distribution of leishmaniasis, we decided not to account for reservoir hosts in our study,
27
28
29
75 assuming that the presence of reservoir host species is unlikely to be a limiting factor.

32 76 Here, we focus on leishmaniasis in Europe, Northern and Central Africa and parts of Asia
33
34 77 (73°N - 10°S, 19°W - 94°E), accounting for the distributional patterns of the five Leishmania
35
36 78 parasite species and their associated vector species (Phlebotomus ssp.) as well as their
37
38
39 79 interrelationship. Most of these vector species are considered to be pathogen-specific (i.e. each
40
41 80 sandfly species typically transmits only one Leishmania species [6]), which should be reflected in
42
43 81 the distribution patterns of the respective pathogens and vectors (see [15], who examined this
44
45
46
82 pattern for Lybia). Mismatches between the assumed patterns may help to evaluate the
47
48 83 recognized vector species-pathogen-relationship. We assume that wherever a pathogen is known
49
50 84 to occur, at least one of the associated vector species must also be present. In case of mismatches,
51
52 85 the following scenarios are possible for a specific location: a) The occurrence of pathogens
53
54
55 86 without competent/suspected vectors may point to a species with a currently unknown vector
56
57 87 potential, b) the absence of pathogens with the presence of competent/suspected vectors might

4
5
6
89 vector species, limited dispersal abilities or biogeographical barriers for infected vectors, or an
7
8 90 incorrect assumption about the vector potential. On the other hand, areas, modelled to be suitable
9
10 91 but currently unrecognized as distributional areas for a certain vector species, could potentially be
11
12
92 suitable regions, which are not inhabited due to biogeographical constrains, dispersal limitations,
13
14
15 93 or not yet recognized due to the lack of entomological surveillance.
16
17
18 94 We focused on the comparison between the geographical distributions of Phlebotomus vector
19
20 95 species and the distributions of pathogens. For the distribution of the vector species, we used an
21
22
23
96 ecological niche modelling approach to establish climatic suitability maps.

32 99 Vector-pathogen-relationship
33
34 100 As a first step, relevant information about the relationship between Phlebotomus vectors and
35
36
37
101 Leishmania pathogens in Eurasia and Africa were gathered from the literature. Each vector
38
39 102 species was linked to the pathogens it is able to transmit (Fig. 1). As the vector competence of
40
41 103 some sandfly species has yet to be confirmed, species were separated into two groups
42
43 104 (“confirmed” and “suspected” vector species).
44
45
46
47
105 Occurrence data
48
49 106 Distribution maps of the Leishmania pathogens were available from different sources [16–19].
50
51 107 The information of these maps (polygon data) was combined resulting in five Leishmania
52
53
108 species-specific distribution maps (Fig. 2).

4
5
6
110 In order to find all potentially suited habitats for the vector species and to not solely rely on the
7
8 111 generally low number of recorded presences, we used an ecological niche modelling (ENM)
9
10 112 approach. The occurrence data for ecological niche modelling of the Phlebotomus species was
11
12
113 mainly obtained from [20] and supplemented by our own literature research (e.g. [21–31]).
13
14
15
16 114 Ecological niche modelling and environmental data
17
18 115 The ecological niche model was based on eight climatic variables provided by worldclim (version
19
20 116 1.4, [32]), downloaded with a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes (this corresponds to spatial
21
22
23
117 resolution of about 1 km2 at the equator). This resolution is in accordance with the resolution of
24
25 118 the occurrence records. Data represent averages for 1960-1990. Four temperature variables and
26
27 119 four precipitation variables, reflecting the mean, minima, maxima and variability of annual
28
29 120 patterns, were considered. More specifically, annual mean temperature (bio01), temperature
30
31
32 121 seasonality, i.e. the standard deviation of monthly temperature (bio04), maximal temperature of
33
34 122 the warmest month (bio05), minimal temperature of the coldest month (bio06), annual
35
36 123 precipitation (bio12), precipitation seasonality (bio15), precipitation of the wettest month (bio13)
37
38
39 124 and precipitation of the driest month (bio14) were chosen as predictive variables. These variables
40
41 125 were considered to be ecologically relevant for the sandfly species [33–35]. Some of these
42
43 126 variables are highly intercorrelated, but in contrast to other ENM approaches Maxent deals well
44
45
46
127 with intercorrelation, so there is less need to remove correlated variables [36]. Other factors such
47
48 128 as land cover, elevation, vegetation indices or soil parameters also affect the distribution patterns
49
50 129 of sand fly species. But in this study we focus on climatic suitability.
51
52
53 130 We used the maximum entropy modelling approach implemented in the software Maxent ([37],
54
55
56
131 version 3.3.3k). The following modifications of the default settings were made: use of only

6
133 convergence threshold of 0.00000001. The permutation importance values were taken as an
7
8 134 estimator for the relative contribution of the different variables to the Maxent model.
9
10
11 135 To allow for a comparison of the polygonal distribution areas of the Leishmania pathogens and
12
13 136 the vectors, binary climatic suitability maps were created, using equal training sensitivity and
14
15
16 137 specificity threshold [39], whose good performance was shown in comparison to other criteria
17
18 138 e.g. by [40]. This threshold minimizes the false positive and negative rates and, similarly, to
19
20 139 maximizes the true negative and positive rates, placing equal weight on presences and absences
21
22
23
140 [41].

25
26 141 GIS-overlay of vector and pathogen distributions
27
28 142 In order to assess the common distribution areas of pathogens and associated vectors, areas were
29
30 143 overlaid. The areas with at least one of the associated vector species modelled to find suitable
31
32
33
144 climatic conditions were displayed in red and the areas with the associated Leishmania pathogen
34
35 145 were displayed as hatched areas (Fig. 2). Maps for each single vector species, depicting
36
37 146 occurrence records and modelled climatic suitability, were also created (Fig. S1).

148 The distributional patterns of vector species indicate different climatic requirements, which are
44
45 149 usually presented in one-variable response curves. These curves reflect the modelled niche
46
47 150 functions (i.e. species-environment relationship) considering only one specific variable and one
48
49
151 species. The occurrence points for the pathogens were derived from overlapping the disease
50
51
52 152 occurrences provided by [1] with the pathogen distribution polygons according to [16,17,18,19].

22 160 Vector – pathogen– disease relationship
23
24 161 We accounted for 48 Phlebotomus species occurring in Africa, Europe and Asia with proven or
25
26
162 assumed vector-competence [3,10,44–50]. The associations between these 48 vector species
27
28
29 163 (Phlebotomus spp.), and the five pathogen species (Leishmania spp.) are summarized in Fig. 1.
30
31 164 For some of the Phlebotomus species, the present core distribution lies outside the considered
32
33 165 study area, e.g. P. chinensis and P. wui with a core distribution in China. For other species, only
34
35
36 166 poor distributional information is currently available (rare species or endemic species with a
37
38 167 small geographical range, e.g. P. celiae). As a result, 16 out of 48 Phlebotomus species were not
39
40 168 taken into account for further analyses due to the few number of available occurrence records
41
42
43
169 within the study area.
44
45
46 170 Most of the considered vector species are considered pathogen-specific, i.e. they are vector-
47
48 171 competent for only one Leishmania species [10]. However, according to [10] and the latest WHO
49
50 172 report [3], a few exceptions exist: P. alexandri has been suggested to transmit L. donovani and L.
51
52
53 173 infantum in parts of China and other countries; P. sergenti is considered a transmitter of L.
54
55 174 tropica and L. aethiopica in parts of Ethiopia; P. duboscqi is considered vector-competent for L.

11 178 Modelled climatic suitability for the considered Phlebotomus species
12
13 179 The models of climatic suitability for 32 out of the 48 Phlebotomus species reflect the observed
14
15
16 180 occurrence distributions well. For most species, the modelled area reaches beyond the area with
17
18 181 observed occurrences (e.g. P. argentipes or P. simici, Fig. S1).
19
20
21 182 Considering the average rank over all considered vector species, temperature seasonality (bio04)
22
23 183 and minimal temperature of the coldest month (bio06) were identified as the variables best
24
25
26 184 explaining the distributional patterns of Phlebotomus species, followed by annual mean
27
28 185 temperature (bio01). The temperature variables generally showed higher contributions to the
29
30 186 Maxent models than the precipitation variables, with some exceptions. In the case of P. chadii, P.
31
32
33
187 langeroni, P. mongolensis, P. similis and P. transcaucasicus precipitation of the driest month
34
35 188 (bio14) was modelled to be the first or second most important predictor variable. The permutation
36
37 189 importance values are summarized in Table S2.

40 190 Distribution of Leishmania pathogens and their vector species
41
42
43
191 The distribution patterns of the five pathogen species are largely in accordance with those of the
44
45 192 associated vector species (Fig. 2). The observed distribution of L. major, L. infantum and L.
46
47 193 donovani overlaps greatly with areas projected to be climatically suitable for at least one of the
48
49
194 associated vector species (except small areas at the edges of the pathogen distribution for L.
50
51
52 195 major (Fig. 2a) and Leishmania donovani (Fig. 2c)). However, there are quite a few regions that
53
54 196 have been modelled as climatically suitable for vector species without occurrence of the
55
56 197 pathogen. Leishmania aethiopica is only known from Ethiopia and adjacent areas in Eritrea,

2
3 198 Sudan and Kenya. Only parts of these regions are modelled to provide climatically suitable
4
5
6
199 conditions for at least one of the associated vector species (Fig. 2d). Similarly, L. tropica matches
7
8 200 the distributions of the associated vectors only in some areas (Eurasia and Morocco); in parts of
9
10 201 Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, and in Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan the pathogen is assumed to
11
12
202 occur but none of the associated vector species seem to find climatically suited habitats there
13
14
15 203 (Fig. 2e). Species-specific vector distribution patterns and observed occurrence points provide
16
17 204 further information (Fig. S1).
18
19
20 205 Leishmania donovani and its associated vector species
21
22
23
206 We took an exemplary look at the distributional patterns of L. donovani and its associated vector
24
25 207 species. The associated vector species of L. donovani might be classified into two groups (Fig. 3)
26
27 208 according to the patterns of geographical distributions. The one group, referred to as “southern
28
29 209 group”, comprising P. argentipes, P. martini, P. orientalis as well as P. rodhaini (depicted in
30
31
32 210 light red and dark red in Fig. 3), is mainly distributed in tropical areas and overlaps with the
33
34 211 distribution of L. donovani (hatched area in Fig. 3). The other group, referred to as “northern
35
36 212 group”, comprises P. alexandri and P. longiductus (depicted in orange in Fig. 3); this group does
37
38
39 213 not overlap with the distribution of the pathogen within the study area. Within the southern
40
41 214 group, we additionally distinguished between vector species with an established vector-
42
43 215 competence (these are: P. argentipes, P. martini and P. orientalis), and P. rodhaini for which
44
45
46
216 vector-competence has only been assumed [48]. It can be noted that the area modelled to be
47
48 217 climatically suitable for P. rodhaini goes beyond the area of the other species of the southern
49
50 218 group (Fig. 3). This means that some parts of the observed distribution of L. donovani only match
51
52 219 with areas modelled to be climatically suitable for P. rodhaini but none of the other known
53
54
55 220 associated vector species.

3 221 The aforementioned differences between the two groups of vector species associated with L.
4
5
6
222 donovani in the distributional patterns in the geographical space are also reflected by differences
7
8 223 in the modelled temperature niche functions (Fig. 4). The modelled optima of annual mean
9
10 224 temperature (bio01) is lower for the northern group of vector species (P. alexandri and P.
11
12
225 longiductus), whereas curves for species found in more tropical climates with monotonously
13
14
15 226 increasing temperature niche curves are more similar to the optimum curve of the pathogen L.
16
17 227 donovani (Fig. 4). Overall, it can be noted that the southern group of vector species is closer
18
19 228 connected to the pathogen L. donovani regarding its geographical distribution as well as the
20
21
22 229 modelled temperature niche than the northern group of vector species.

25 230 Discussion
26
27 231 Leishmaniasis is an important neglected tropical disease [7] and was chosen here to compare
28
29 232 distributional patterns of pathogens and vectors. A GIS-based spatial overlay analysis was
30
31
32 233 applied, integrating observed distribution data of pathogens and modelled climatic suitability for
33
34 234 the vector species, to enable verification, at least to some degree, of the known or suspected
35
36 235 vector-pathogen relationships cited in the literature.
37
38
39
236 Modelled climatic suitability for vector species of leishmaniasis
40
41
42 237 Reliable data of species’ distribution is often difficult to obtain, but is of great importance for
43
44 238 estimating disease risks. Due to the lack of reliable distributions maps for the large number of
45
46 239 vector species, an ecological niche modelling approach was used to generate climatic suitability
47
48
49 240 maps revealing potential areas of vector distribution. Principal validity of the application of
50
51 241 ecological niche modelling based on climatic variables for Phlebotomus species has been
52
53 242 previously shown in [15,51–55].

2
3 243 As patterns of modelled climatic suitability reflected the observed occurrences of the 32
4
5
6
244 Phlebotomus species well, with AUC values of above 0.88 for all species, the modelling results
7
8 245 could be used as estimators for the distributional patterns of the considered vector species. For
9
10 246 some Phlebotomus species the area with modelled climatic suitability goes beyond the area with
11
12
247 observed occurrence. Reasons for this could be the following: a) a sampling bias for some of the
13
14
15 248 species in the occurrence data, i.e. the species have been recorded only in some parts of its
16
17 249 distributional range; b) insufficient time or dispersal barriers like oceans or mountain ranges
18
19 250 might have prevented species to reach all places with suitable climatic conditions (so far); c)
20
21
22 251 disregarding one or more factors others than climate being important drivers for the distributional
23
24 252 patterns may yield an overestimation of the potential distribution.
25
26
27 253 Vector-pathogen relationship
28
29 254 In general, the distributional patterns of the Leishmania pathogens are in good accordance with
30
31
32 255 the areas modelled to be climatically suitable for at least one of the associated vector species.
33
34 256 However, small areas at the edges of a pathogen distribution seemingly lack suitable habitats for
35
36 257 the associated vectors. This is most obvious for the southern edge of L. major, L. aethiopica and
37
38
39 258 L. tropica. In the case of L. major, the vector distribution (proven and suspected vectors) does not
40
41 259 entirely cover the distribution of the pathogen. The southern edge of the L. major distribution lies
42
43 260 in the vegetation zone covered by tropical rainforest, and may be the habitat of a currently
44
45
46
261 unknown vector species for this pathogen. Another reason might be an underestimation of the
47
48 262 climatic suitability for a vector species, which was lost due to dichotomy usage. Furthermore,
49
50 263 Phlebotomus ansarii, suspected to be vector competent for L. major, but not considered here due
51
52 264 to the lack of occurrence records, has only been reported for Iran, so far [56]. In the case of L.
53
54
55 265 aethiopica, the currently known distribution is relatively small in comparison to the other
56
57 266 Leishmania species. Records of L. aethiopica are currently restricted to the highlands of Ethiopia

1
2
3 267 and Kenya [57]. The aforementioned mismatch can probably be ascribed to the fact that some of
4
5
6
268 the associated vector species were not included in the analysis due to insufficient data, e.g. P.
7
8 269 aculeatus which is assumed to be vector-competent for L. aethiopica and known to occur in
9
10 270 Kenya [58]. However, the vector competence of P. aculeatus has been questioned by [57],
11
12
271 referring to the morphological indistinguishability between P. aculeatus and P. pedifer.
13
14
15 272 Phlebotomus pedifer, as well as P. longipes, are the two main vectors for L. aethiopica [57], but
16
17 273 their models of climatic suitability were based on a very small number of occurrence points (6 for
18
19 274 P. pedifer, 14 for P. longipes) Thus, the distribution of these species might be underrepresented
20
21
22 275 in these data, which may have led to an underestimation of the area with modelled climatically
23
24 276 suitability for these species.
25
26
27 277 The distribution of L. tropica is largely covered by area modelled to be suitable for P. sergenti
28
29 278 (except the area around Kenya). Besides P. sergenti, the two vector species with suspected vector
30
31
32 279 competence P. chabaudii and P. simici were considered in the GIS-overlay in Fig. 2e. The
33
34 280 discrepancies in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, and in Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan
35
36 281 are likely to be explained by the fact that a number of known vector species (e.g. P. arabicus, P.
37
38
39 282 guggisbergeri, P. groveri and P. rossi) were not considered in the modelling due to lack of
40
41 283 occurrence data. Especially for sandflies as species of small body size, a potential sampling bias
42
43 284 due to an underestimation of occurrences in certain area is quite likely.
44
45
46 285 For all species, the area modelled to be climatically suitable for the vector species reaches beyond
47
48
49 286 the observed pathogen distribution area. The most plausible explanation might not generally be
50
51 287 an erroneous vector-pathogen association, but rather that the vector species is able to occur under
52
53 288 a broader temperature range compared to the pathogen, which may require higher temperatures
54
55
56
289 for its development and transmission ([59]). Another explanation might be that infected vectors

3 290 did not reach some parts of the areas with potentially suitable climatic conditions yet, e.g. due to
4
5
6
291 biogeographical dispersal barriers and due to their weak flying abilities. For example, in the case
7
8 292 of L. major, the observed pathogen distribution area covers parts of the Sahara desert with
9
10 293 extreme climatic conditions, hostile for many species and requiring species’ to be adapted.
11
12
294 Among the seven associated vector species of L. major, P. bergeroti was the only with modelled
13
14
15 295 climatic suitability in the central parts of the Sahara.
16
17
18 296 We had a closer look at the distributional patterns of L. donovani and its associated vector
19
20 297 species, which can be distinguished into two groups according to the vectors’ distribution pattern:
21
22
23
298 one group occurring further north in the study area (comprising P. alexandri and P. longiductus)
24
25 299 and a second group occurring further south in the study area (comprising the species P.
26
27 300 argentipes, P. martini, P. orientalis as well as P. rodhaini). This separation of the associated
28
29 301 vector species into two groups can also be found regarding the one-variable response curve with
30
31
32 302 the annual mean temperature as explanatory variable. Species of the first group show optima
33
34 303 under lower temperatures whereas species of the second group, including L. donovani, show a
35
36 304 monotonously increasing niche curve. The vector species of the “southern” group are modelled to
37
38
39 305 co-occur with L. donovani, whereas P. alexandri and P. longiductus of the “northern” group do
40
41 306 not show any overlap with the observed pathogen distribution.
42
43
44 307 The area modelled to be climatically suitable for the species of the second southern group with P.
45
46 308 argentipes, P. martini, P. orientalis and P. rodhaini is in good accordance with the observed
47
48
49 309 distribution of the pathogen, i.e. the area modelled to be climatically suitable for at least one of
50
51 310 the associated vector species covers the pathogen distribution and goes further beyond. However,
52
53 311 distinguishing between proven and suspected vector species it becomes obvious that some parts
54
55
56
312 of the observed pathogen distribution cannot be explained when only Phlebotomus species with

2
3 313 proven vector competence (i.e. P. argentipes, P. martini and P. orientalis) are taken into account.
4
5
6
314 Phlebotomus celiae, another proven vector species for L. donovani, which has not been
7
8 315 considered in the modelling due to the lack of occurrence data, might fill in this gap. However, P.
9
10 316 celiae occurs in savanna and forest areas in Kenya and Ethiopia [3] and is only known to act as a
11
12
317 vector in Ethiopia [10]. Phlebotomus vansomerenae is also suspected to act as a vector for L.
13
14
15 318 donovani in Kenya [10]. Phlebotomus rodhaini, on the other hand, is another suspected vector
16
17 319 and was modelled to find suitable climatic conditions in large parts of the pathogen’s distribution.
18
19 320 Based on two female individuals of P. rodhaini infected with L. donovani and caught in eastern
20
21
22 321 Sudan, [48] suggested P. rodhaini being a possible vector of L. donovani for animal reservoir
23
24 322 hosts but questioned its role inhuman infections. Among the considered 32 sandfly species, P.
25
26 323 rodhaini is the only occurring vector species in some areas, and its role as an important vector
27
28
29
324 seems evident. However, there may also be another disregarded vector competent species that
30
31 325 occurs in the region.
32
33
34 326
35
36 327 The purpose of the study was to compare the geographical distributions of Phlebotomus vector
37
38
328 species and the distributions of their associated Leishmania pathogens and should lead to a better
39
40
41 329 understanding of the vector-pathogen relationship, which could yield a better development of
42
43 330 vector and disease surveillance and control programmes. However, the study is faced with some
44
45 331 challenges, e.g. dealing with two different levels of distributional data: observed occurrence
46
47
48 332 records (point data) for vector distribution and expert based distribution areas (polygon data) for
49
50 333 pathogen distribution. In order to bring this data into line, we have carried out an ecological niche
51
52 334 modelling approach. In ENM approaches some aspects should be kept in mind when interpreting
53
54
55
335 the modelling results, but do not reduce the overall validity of the study. Models are only as good
56
57 336 as the data they are based on. When using occurrence records as distributional data, one is usually
58 15
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 16 of 31
1
2
3 337 confronted with a sampling bias that is also reflected in the modelling results. In some regions,
4
5
6
338 the modelled vector distribution may be overestimated, as the species may be absent due to
7
8 339 dispersal limitations (due to barriers like oceans or mountains) or due to relevant ecological
9
10 340 factors disregarded in our approach (soil, land cover, biotic interaction). On the other hand the
11
12
341 model could result in an underestimation of the vector species distribution in other regions for
13
14
15 342 several reasons. These could be due to model overfitting or due to an underrepresentation of the
16
17 343 species’ distribution in the occurrence data (indicated e.g. by a low number of occurrence records
18
19 344 or occurrence records being clustered in a certain region). A potential underestimation of the
20
21
22 345 vector species distribution could be attributed to the choice of the threshold when transforming
23
24 346 the continuous modelling result into binary maps, as the used threshold was found to yield the
25
26 347 smallest area projected as suitable compared to other threshold selections [60]. In addition, the
27
28
29
348 considered pathogen distribution not beyond doubt, too.
30
31
32 349 Apart from the challenge that distributional data of different levels (point data vs. polygon data)
33
34 350 were compared, the available data refer to different time scales. Thus, the approach is based on
35
36 351 the assumption that the spatial distribution patterns of the different components (vectors and
37
38
39 352 pathogens) have not changed over time. This is a strong assumption, especially for species with
40
41 353 low dispersal ability such as sandflies. Data availability remains a crucial limiting factor in
42
43 354 correlative modelling approaches.
44
45
46 355 Conclusion
47
48
49 356 Distribution areas of pathogens that do not overlap with areas modelled to be suitable for vector
50
51 357 species might hint towards inappropriate entomological field work of vector reporting, e.g. in
52
53 358 remotes areas. Thus, further monitoring the current distribution of sandfly species is of great
54
55
56
359 importance and the joint actions of public health and veterinarian authorities in the sense of a

3 360 “One health approach” should be strengthened. Ecological niche modelling accounting for
4
5
6
361 interactions among hosts, vectors, and parasites offer powerful approaches for identifying regions
7
8 362 potentially at risk for infection. Our approach can support risk assessments of leishmaniasis and
9
10 363 thereby potentially help contain the disease. However, much more detail and consideration of
11
12
364 other risk factors (e.g., human socioeconomic variables), are required for full development of risk
13
14
15 365 maps [14]. If data become available, future analyses should also account these factors as well as
16
17 366 for disease cases to further narrow down areas of risk.

Appendix B
Dear Dr. Greig,
Thank you for your kind reply and the opportunity to review the manuscript. We incorporated
and addressed the changes that you and the two reviewers made. We hope that the text was
mproved to your satisfaction.
Please find our responses in italics and indented below.
Kind regards,
Sarah Cunze, on behalf of all authors
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Denise Greig): Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
This paper uses GIS to model the relationships between Leishmania parasite species and their
sandfly vector species and to identify any mismatches based on known and expected (based
on climate) occurrence data of parasite/vector pairs. This manuscript provides a thoughtful
synthesis, discussion, and visualization of some complex data and the map figures are really
well done.
am not familiar with the Maxent software and defer to the two reviewers who had several
nsightful comments. Both pointed out limitations and recent improvements to Maxent,
which, if you are not able to address through your analysis, should be described in the text so
hat readers know of those limitations.
Below are a few minor comments and suggestions on word choice:
Line 90. delete comma after the word “areas”
Done
Line 126. First mention of Maxent here, but it is not described until line 130. Please correct.
Done
Line 168. Replace “few” with “limited”
Done
Line 206. I’m not sure that “exemplary” is the word you are looking for here. Maybe re-write
his first sentence and say why you focused specifically on L. donovani and its associated
vector species?
Done
Line 283. I would insert “a” before species and add an “s” to the word “area” in the next line.
Done
Line 291. Replace “and due to” with “or”
Done
Line 304. I don’t think “monotonously” is the word you mean here. Maybe “….the niches of
he second group, including L donovani, show optima at warmer temperatures”
Done
Line 310. Change to “covers and extends beyond the known pathogen distribution.” And
delete “and goes further beyond”
Done
Line 357. Maybe change “inappropriate” to “incomplete”?
Done
Reviewer comments to Author: Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
previously reviewed this same manuscript to another Journal. Again, I still see that the
manuscript by Cunze et al. presents an interesting work on leishmaniasis in Eurasia and
Africa. The authors clearly stated the objectives of their study to compare the geographical
distributions of Phlebotomus vector species and their corresponding pathogens. The
manuscript is in the line with these objectives and therefore represents a valuable contribution
n the field of vector and distributional ecology. So, I see that the manuscript is worth to be
published; many improvements were considered to the original version I reviewed previously
or another Journal. Finally, my decision remains the same to my previous one and I strongly
ecommend the manuscript for publication in your Journal after considering some concerns
hat I will detail below:
We are grateful to Reviewer 1 for the kind and valuable comments and suggestions.
Line 31-34: The vector incrimination requires other factors to be considered before
drawing a similar conclusion. So, I would kindly ask the author to change this piece to reflect
only their finding based on a single factor of vector incrimination (co-occurrence/co-existence
of both vector and pathogen in question).
We placed a similar phrasing before the statement, but kept lines 31-34 unchanged. It
now reads:“Based on this single factor of vector incrimination, that is, co-occurrence
of both vector and pathogen, most of the pathogens occurred with at least one of the
associated vector species. In the case of L. donovani ….”
Line 63: Add “as one of the vector incrimination criteria adopted by WHO [3]”.
Done
Line 75: This assumption is incorrectly stated; as I mentioned previously don't get
yourself into such debates in this era. I would suggest the authors to use the previous literature
o reflect that one of the reasons to exclude reservoirs in their analyses is the much broader
anges for these hosts (ref. 15 in your list “https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004381” and
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.08.014).
The sentence was changed and the references added. It now reads: “Although the
presence or absence of reservoirs is crucial for the distribution of leishmaniasis,
reservoir hosts were not included in the analysis. One of the reasons is their much
broader range of distribution [15,16].
Line 82: Change “Lybia” to “Libya”.
Done
Line 106-113: Cite supplementary materials in the text, particularly data used for
modeling Phlebotomus spp.
Done
Line 116: Change “5 arc minutes” to “30 arc-seconds”.
5 arc minutes is correct, but we changed 1 km into 10 km accordingly.
Line 244: AUC is longer a sensitive tool to evaluate model robustness (see Lobo et al.
2008, and Peterson et al. 2008). Authors should consider a more robust tool to evaluate their
models; you may use PartialROC (Peterson et al. 2008) or an independent set of records if
available. I am aware that you placed great efforts on your analyses, so, I suggest to add a
paragraph that place all study limitations together in the discussion and include this one as one
of these limitations.
As suggested by the reviewer we inserted a paragraph in the discussion that
summarizes all limitations of the study addressing the PartialROC.
Line 115—127: The environmental data used for the niche modeling analyses were
imited and missing important variables, for example, EVI, and soil factors that are available
or present-day conditions which are the main interest of this study. Thanks to the authors to
nclude the statement on line 128-129; however, these factors are still important to estimate
he ecological niches of these species. Please outline this one in the limitation section I
previously referred (see my previous comment).
We have extended the last paragraph in the discussion and made it a separate section
entitled “Limitations of the study approach”.
Line 130-134: Several improvements have been introduced to the field of ecological
modeling. These improvements solved some problems associated with species distribution
modeling, particularly in the case of Maxent. None of these were considered in this analysis;
estimating accessible area for model calibration of the species in question (See Barve et al.
2011 and Owens et al. 2013); some of these species have limited distribution to Europe, so,
calibrating these models should be limited to areas accessible for the species (M component
of the BAM diagram). Please consider adding this item to the limitations section.
Included in the section “Limitations of the study approach”
The limitations paragraph on line 338-348 marks an improvement for this manuscript
version, so, I would suggest adding all missed items that I referred previously in my review.
Done.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Authors
Thanks for good idea for this study. It is recommended to see the comments put on the
attached file and revise this manuscript.
We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for the kind and valuable comments and suggestions.
Comments have been transferred from the PDF into the response letter.
L101: Did you model the distribution of pathogens as well?
Clarifued in the text (No we didn’t.)
L 132: Please see two relevant references about the predictive bioclimatic variables on CL
and VL vectors: (Predicted Distribution of Visceral Leishmaniasis Vectors
Diptera: Psychodidae; Phlebotominae) in Iran: A Niche
Model Study. Zoonoses and Public Health, 2015, 62, 644–654
Modeling the Distribution of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Vectors
Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) in Iran: A Potential Transmission
n Disease Prone Areas. J. Med. Entomol. 52(4): 557–565 (2015).
We refer to these studies in the revised version.
L. 150: Do you mean you used the output of MaxEnt model as the layer of Leishmaniasis
vector? If yes, please explain more about the threshold used for presence of sandfly vector?
You know the output of model predicts between 0 and 1.
Clarified. (Yes; we considered areas where at least one vector is modelled to be
present in a binary Maxent model)
167ff: In this section please just present the findings of this study. All discussions and
nterpretations should be moved to the Discussion section.
Done
177: Six species modelled in this study have less than 20 presence records:
P. chadi=12; P. langeroni=6; P. longipes=14; P. pedifer=6; P. salehi=8; P. similis=19. It
seems more presence records are necessary for Maxent.
We discuss this item in the section “Limitations of the study approach”
203 The map of L. donovani missed India!!
Included in the section “Limitations of the study approach”
211 The maps of Leishmania parasites show an overview of the areas where the disease can
be occurred. For example L. major foci didn't report from the east of Turkey and Northwest of
ran, but the map covered these areas. There maps are not 100 percent reliable. Please note
his.
Done
228 Here is results, you should just present your findings. Please move all discussions and
nterpretations of your findings to the discussion section of this manuscript.
Done
239 This part is not discussion. It presented in Introduction and so it is suggested to remove it.
Done
250 There are more studies on sandflies using MaxEnt in the area you studied in this research.
Please do a comprehensive review of literature and use the relevant references in your
discussion.
We refer to the references you mentioned.
252 For modeling of sandflies, did you use all occurrence points for training the model?
Which portion of point used as test data?
We decided not to split the data into trainings and test data sets because of the low
numbers of available occurrence records for some species.
256 Please note you used few papers as resources of occurrence data for sandflies. So, you
missed many records of sandflies in your study. This point also should be noted in discussion.
Included in the section “Limitations of the study approach”
Fig2: What does mean "modelled climatic suitability" here? Do you mean in Red areas, the
environment is 100 percent suitable for at least one sandfly vector?
No, it doesn’t. Area, suitable for at least one of the associated vector species
according to the binary modelling results are displayed in red.
Clarified in the figure legend.
Fig3: I think you missed Indian continent as the endemic area for L. donovani. Please do more
eview of literature and revise this map.
We now discuss this in the section “Limitations of the study approach”
