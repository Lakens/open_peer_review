The manuscript RSOS-160763 entitled as “Geohistorical records indicate no impact of the
Deepwater Horizon oil spill on oyster body size” by Dietl & Durham looks at pre-spill body-size
baselines for Crassostrea virginica adults from assemblages of dead shells collected from beds
along Louisiana’s coastline and compares these baselines with size data from live oysters from
the same beds which lived through the DWH oil spill and its aftermath. Using a Before-After-
Control-Impact (BACI) analysis, the authors found that average body size of oysters remained
relatively unchanged after the DWH oil spill.
Overall, I thought that the methodological approach was novel, sensible and comprehensive. I
find particularly interesting and promising that the use of geohistorical records of an oyster reef
(i.e. subsurface layers of dead shells that are a several centuries old) can inform us about the
impact of an environmental disaster, particularly where local baseline data are scarce. This
manuscript is well written, fairly straightforward, and concise. I would recommend this article
for publication in Royal Society Open Science as the study uses an interesting experimental
approach and has societal significant relevance that would be of interest to the readership of
label_version_2
RSOS. I have a few general comments that the authors may want to consider and some minor
comments which are mentioned below:
3
1°/- One question I have concerns the main finding of the study, i.e. adult oyster growth was not
affected by the DWH oil. Why the section “Possible explanation for lack of oyster body size
change following the DWH oil spill” is presented in the supplementary material and not included
in the discussion page 12 instead? Is it due to some of the journal formatting requirements (page
limits)? In my opinion, this part is essential to attempt to explain your counterintuitive result, and
lies definitely within the scope of the study. As a result, it should be included in the MS.
2°/- On page 5, line 94, you mention that the sites you selected for the study were not previously
subjected to restoration efforts, shell plantings or recent commercial harvesting. What about the
cleaning efforts of oiled sites that followed the spill? Have the “impacted” sites you chose to
study been subject to cleaning efforts? Several studies (Grabowski, 2015; Powers, 2015a,b) have
shown that raking of nearshore habitat to remove oil resulted in severe oyster mortality and
decrease in oyster cover. This decrease in oyster density could have been beneficial to oyster
growth due to a higher food availability, which could explain the increase of average body size
between 2011 and 2012.
3°/- You should mention in the M&M section (maybe line 109?) that sample sizes of live oysters
measured in the LA from Site 2 and site 8 were pretty low in 2012 (n=9) and 2013 (n=7)
respectively.
Minor revisions:
Line 94: Footnote is not a reference. Change “harvesting [1]” to “harvesting 1” instead
Line 251: See question 1°/: I think you should have developed this paragraph further.
References: Formatting of some references are not consistent. For instance, line 293, reference “2”
is presented as “Michel et al.” and reference “3” is a list of authors.

3 12 Documentation of the near- and long-term effects of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, one of the
4
5
6 13 largest environmental disasters in United States history, is still ongoing. We used a novel Before-After-
7
8 14 Control-Impact analysis to test the hypothesis that average body size of intertidal populations of the
9
10 15 eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) inhabiting impacted areas in Louisiana decreased due to increased
11
12
13 16 stress/ mortality related to the oil spill. Time-averaged death assemblages of oysters were used to
14
15 17 establish a pre-spill baseline of body size structure for four impacted and four control locations along a
16
17 18 350km stretch of Louisiana’s coastline. Post-spill body sizes were then measured from live oysters at
18
19
20
19 each site in order to evaluate the differences in body size between oiled (i.e., impact) and unoiled (i.e.,
21
22 20 control) locations before and after the spill. Our results indicate that average body size of oysters
23
24 21 remained relatively unchanged after the oil spill. There were also no temporal patterns in temperature,
25
26
22 salinity, or disease prevalence that could have explained our results. Together, these findings suggest
27
28
29 23 that oysters either recovered rapidly following the immediate impact of the DWH oil spill, or that its
30
31 24 impact was not severe enough to influence short-term population dynamics of the oyster beds.

3 27 1. Introduction
4
5
6 28 The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill began on April 20, 2010 and became one of the worst
7
8 29 environmental disasters in United States history. Over 87 days, 3.19 million barrels of oil poured into the
9
10 30 northern Gulf of Mexico, resulting in widespread environmental and economic damage to the Gulf Coast
11
12
13 31 and a massive, still-ongoing assessment and remediation effort [1]. In the years since the spill, many
14
15 32 studies have documented significant direct and indirect effects of both the oil spill itself and the human
16
17 33 response to it [2–8]. For instance, field surveys have documented 77% lower percent cover of oysters
18
19
20
34 (Crassostrea virginica)—one of the most ecologically and economically important Gulf Coast species
21
22 35 [9]—in nearshore areas that experienced heavy oiling relative to reference locations that were not oiled
23
24 36 [10]. Damage to oyster habitat was also related to oil cleanup and spill response activities, including
25
26
37 estimated losses of over one billion adult-equivalent oysters, killed by emergency freshwater diversions
27
28
29 38 from the Mississippi River conducted in response to the oil spill [10–13].
30
31 39 Such acute impacts are often assessed using comparisons with reference sites that varied in
32
33 40 exposure to oil contamination, but this approach overlooks the possibility that impacts may exist at
34
35
36 41 these sites despite a lack of visible oil. This issue highlights a common source of uncertainty in many
37
38 42 scientific assessments of the ecological effects of oil spills—insufficient baseline information (e.g., [4,10].
39
40 43 Many DWH oil spill impact estimates were based on relative comparisons between areas that differed in
41
42
43
44 the levels of observed oil, or baseline samples hastily collected before oil reached the coast [1,4].
44
45 45 However, there is no reason to expect that physical and biological characteristics of a given oyster bed
46
47 46 this year (or month or day) are representative of previous or future years. The ecology of oyster beds, as
48
49
47 with other habitat types, changes naturally over time, even in the absence of any human perturbation.
50
51
52 48 Such dynamics often occur over decades, centuries or millennia—time-frames that are well beyond the
53
54 49 duration of the “ecological snapshots” that are the source of conventional data for assessing the effects
55
56 50 of major, unplanned environmental disturbances [14]. Baseline ecological attributes of an ecosystem,
57
58
59
60 3
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 4 of 28
1
2
3 51 such as an oyster bed, should minimally reflect knowledge of the system on a decadal to centennial
4
5
6 52 scale in order to integrate natural variability [15].
7
8 53 Here, we use a novel geohistorical approach to obtain pre-spill, site-specific, body-size baselines
9
10 54 for C. virginica from assemblages of dead shells collected from intertidal oyster beds along a 350km
11
12
13 55 stretch of Louisiana’s coastline (figure 1). We compared these baselines with body-size data from live-
14
15 56 collected oysters that lived through the DWH oil spill and its aftermath to examine its effects on this
16
17 57 iconic estuarine species. We show that average body size of large oysters was not affected by the DWH
18
19
20
58 oil spill.
21
22 59
23
24 60 (a) Death Assemblages
25
26
61 Often overlooked sources of long-term baseline data that may be particularly helpful for assessing the
27
28
29 62 DWH oil spill’s impacts on oyster populations are death assemblages (DA)—the whole and broken shells
30
31 63 that accumulate over time in the uppermost centimeters of the sediment surface on oyster beds (i.e.,
32
33 64 “subsurface tier” in figure 2; [16]. Most shells in a DA typically are decades to centuries old [17]; thus,
34
35
36 65 oyster DAs capture information on sufficient timescales to average out much of the natural, short-term
37
38 66 variation on the oyster bed for a range of ecological attributes [18]. Further, most dead remains never
39
40 67 are buried deep enough or are destroyed before being incorporated into the DA, which means that the
41
42
43
68 dead shells buried in oyster beds represent conditions of the bed in the past, relative to the live
44
45 69 assemblage (LA; [17]. Quantitative comparisons of ecological attributes such as relative abundance of
46
47 70 species in DAs and LAs have been shown to be sensitive to relatively rapid, short-term anthropogenic
48
49
71 disturbances [17], because the time-averaged and time-lagged nature of DAs ensures that changes to
50
51
52 72 the LA will take time to be reflected in the composition of the DA. Given these characteristics, oyster DA
53
54 73 samples collected before or soon after the oil spill should reflect average conditions on the oyster beds
55
56 74 for at least several decades into the past.

6 76 (b) Why Oysters?
7
8
9 77 We focused on oyster beds because, in addition to producing abundant DAs in Louisiana coastal
10
11 78 sediments, C. virginica is the principal benthic suspension feeder in the northern Gulf of Mexico region
12
13 79 [7,19] and provides a wide diversity of ecosystem goods and services, including water filtration, nitrogen
14
15
16 80 removal, provision of habitat for juvenile fish (including many commercially valuable species),
17
18 81 stabilization of salt marsh habitats and shorelines, and food production [20,21]. Oysters also have
19
20 82 previously been used as “ecological indicators” to assess biological and environmental impacts [22,23]
21
22
83 because their epifaunal, sessile life mode makes them both sensitive to contaminants in their
23
24
25 84 environment —including oil [7,24]—and relatively easy to monitor. Given that decreased growth is a
26
27 85 common sublethal response in oysters exposed to oil-related contaminants (e.g., [25,26], we predicted
28
29 86 that average body sizes1 of the dead oyster shells (i.e., pre-spill data from DAs) would be larger than the
30
31
32 87 average body sizes of the live-collected oysters (i.e., post-spill data from LAs) at locations where oil was
33
34 88 observed. In contrast, in the absence of oiling (i.e., at control sites), the average body sizes of live and
35
36 89 dead oysters should be similar.
37
38

40
41 91 2. Material and Methods
42
43 92 (a) Sampling and Data Collection
44
45
46
93 We sampled dead and live oysters from eight intertidal sites across Louisiana’s coastline that had not
47
48 94 previously been subjected to restoration efforts, shell plantings, or recent commercial harvesting [1];
49
50 95 figure 1, electronic supplementary material). Oyster samples were collected under scientific collecting
51
52
53 1
54 We measured body size because it is one of the most important functional traits of an organism, influencing the
55 type and strength of ecological interactions [27] and life history traits [28]. Further, many ecological processes also
56 are strongly size-dependent; that is, size-based metrics integrate a variety of information on the state and
57 functioning of ecosystems. Body size also can be measured from both live and dead oysters, is comparable across
58 sites, and is expected to vary along disturbance gradients according to ecological and energetic constraints [29].

6 97 each of the localities was sampled over a 2-month period (January to February). Our sampling strategy
7
8 98 was planned to coincide with the non-spawning period for oysters: one year and older oysters typically
9
10 99 spawn in the northern Gulf of Mexico from about early spring through early fall [30].
11
12
13 100 All locations were representative of intertidal oyster beds in salt marshes, and were subjected to
14
15 101 varying levels of direct and indirect impact from the DWH oil spill, as determined by SCAT (Shoreline
16
17 102 Cleanup Assessment Technique) surveys of oil-impacted areas (figure 1), but were outside the areas of
18
19
20
103 large-scale impacts of the freshwater diversions from the Mississippi River in Barataria Bay and Black
21
22 104 Bay/Breton Sound [13]. The studied salt marshes covered a wide range of expected variability in
23
24 105 estuarine habitat attributes—size, surrounding anthropogenic activity and general physical-chemical
25
26
106 conditions (e.g., salinity, turbidity). All sites also had similar associated benthic invertebrate species (e.g.,
27
28
29 107 presence/ absence of mussels, Ischadium recurvum, and mud crabs, Eurypanopeus spp.).
30
31 108 In each year of sampling, between four and 10 replicate samples were established at each
32
33 109 location. Each sample of live and dead oysters was collected from 30 cm x 30 cm plots down to
34
35
36 110 approximately 30 cm depth. Dead oysters were only collected in the first year of sampling at each site,
37
38 111 because the composition of the DA does not change appreciably from year to year [17]. A 30cm
39
40 112 sampling depth typifies that of many other live-dead data sets derived from marine and estuarine
41
42
43
113 sediments [17]. We followed Powell et al. [31] in defining two tiers—surficial and subsurface—in the
44
45 114 oyster beds we sampled (figure 2). The surficial tier included living oysters and associated fauna (i.e., the
46
47 115 LA) and surficial dead shells (i.e., cultch) and is the layer at which most shell addition and loss takes
48
49
116 place (e.g., through dissolution, bioerosion or breakage by predators; [32–36]; figure 2). Half-lives of
50
51
52 117 newly added shells in the surficial tier are usually <10 years [35,37]. In contrast, the subsurface tier
53
54 118 contains shells that are buried deeply enough that exhumation is unlikely (i.e., they are below the final
55
56 119 burial depth, figure 2), and is stable over very long timescales (half-lives for shells in the subsurface tier

2
3 120 are at least 50 to 100 times longer than for shell in the surficial tier; [31]. The limited probability of burial
4
5
6 121 and long shell half-lives in the subsurface tier cause the DA composition to be time-averaged, and to lag
7
8 122 behind any strong directional change (e.g., oil or dispersant stress) in the composition of the LA (surficial
9
10 123 tier).
11
12
13 124 A 2.5 mm mesh sieve was used to process each sample. All right valves of live oysters in the
14
15 125 surficial tier and dead oysters from the subsurface tier in each sample were sorted and counted, and
16
17 126 shell heights (the distance between the shell umbo and growth margin) were measured to the nearest
18
19
20
127 0.1 mm with digital calipers. Dead shells from the surficial tier samples were excluded. We also limited
21
22 128 our live-dead comparisons to large oysters (>65 mm in shell height) for several reasons. First, because
23
24 129 oysters in Louisiana reach 50-60mm in their <U+FB01>rst year of growth [38], the large oysters collected in our
25
26
130 first year of sampling (2011) must have lived through the DWH oil spill. Second, limiting our analysis to
27
28
29 131 large individuals helped to avoid ambiguous results (see [39] for a similar standardization). For instance,
30
31 132 a decrease in mean size in a population could be caused by selective losses of large individuals following
32
33 133 an environmental impact (e.g., DWH oil spill) or enhanced recruitment if all individuals are included.
34
35
36 134 Third, large oysters are more durable than smaller oysters, so the larger portion of the size-frequency
37
38 135 distribution of a DA best reflects underlying population dynamics of the living population [40].
39
40 136
41
42 137 (b) Data Analysis
43
44
45 138 We used a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) analysis [41,42] to test for the effects of the DWH oil spill
46
47 139 on oyster body size which, as an individual-based metric, is one of the best-performing variables for this
48
49 140 kind of analysis [43]. Our BACI analysis compared the difference in average oyster body sizes (=65mm in
50
51
52 141 shell height) before and after the oil spill at sites where no oil was observed with the differences at
53
54 142 impacted sites. In this analysis, the absence of significant differences between post-spill impact and
55
56 143 control site means relative to the pre-spill difference in means would signal recovery (or no impact).

3 144 Many variants of BACI models exist and are commonly used to assess environmental impacts of both
4
5
6 145 planned developments and unplanned environmental accidents [41,43,44], including other oil spill
7
8 146 events in Louisiana [45]. These types of analyses have many advantages, including their ability to handle
9
10 147 uneven sampling designs and that sampling environmental variability among sites is encouraged [41].
11
12
13 148 Application of these methods to unplanned environmental accidents is often problematic
14
15 149 because data on the indicator of interest from before the accident are not available [41,46]. However,
16
17 150 by using the oyster DAs as a pre-spill record of population body size, we were able to avoid this problem.
18
19
20
151 Localities whose sample sites were all located where no visible oil was documented were considered
21
22 152 controls, while localities having at least one sample site within 200m of where moderate or heavy oil
23
24 153 was observed were considered impacted localities. Based on these criteria, Rabbit Island, Marsh Island,
25
26
154 Caillou Lake, and LUMCON localities were controls and Bay Bourbeux, Grand Isle, Mendicant Island, and
27
28
29 155 Grand Terre Canal were impacted localities (see figure 1). The BACI analysis was carried out using a
30
31 156 mixed model with two fixed factors (treatment and time) and two random factors (locality and year).
32
33 157 We included terms for the main effects of treatment (i.e., control or impact) and time (i.e., before or
34
35
36 158 after the DWH oil spill), the interaction between treatment and time, and the random effects of locality
37
38 159 and year. We calculated a BACI contrast estimate using the least squares means for the interaction
39
40 160 effect. All statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical package JMP 11.0.0 (SAS Institute
41
42
43
161 Inc.).

53

9
10 171 3a). Overall, average oyster heights followed similar trends through time at both control and impact
11
12
13 172 locations (figure 3b).
14
15 173
16
17 174 4. Discussion
18
19
20
175 Our results suggest that average body size of large oysters (=65mm shell height) in intertidal habitats of
21
22 176 coastal Louisiana remained relatively unchanged after the DWH oil spill, with no differences detected
23
24 177 between populations from control and impact locations. In fact, the body size differences between
25
26
178 control and impact locations before and after the oil spill falls well within the variability in average body
27
28
29 179 sizes of oysters between sites, even within the same treatment category, suggesting that this difference
30
31 180 is not biologically significant. For instance, the difference in average body sizes of oysters (=65mm shell
32
33 181 height) between the impacted localities Grand Isle and Mendicant Island in 2011 was 13mm (Grand Isle
34
35
36 182 and Mendicant Island average sizes in 2011 were 93mm and 80mm, respectively; electronic
37
38 183 supplementary material 2), several times larger than the difference indicated by the BACI contrast
39
40 184 estimate (1.9mm; figure 3).
41
42
43
185 Because we conducted the BACI analysis on average body size it was not sensitive to temporal
44
45 186 changes in some other potentially important variables [41], such as the shape of the frequency
46
47 187 distributions of oyster body sizes before and after the DWH oil spill. However, the distribution of oyster
48
49
188 sizes (=65mm shell height) was not different between control and impact treatments for all DA and LA
50
51
52 189 samples (electronic supplementary material 1). Furthermore, the results did not change when we ran
53
54 190 the BACI analysis on median instead of mean oyster body size (electronic supplementary material 1),

2
3 191 suggesting that our focus on means did not mask effects of the DWH spill on the distribution of body
4
5
6 192 sizes.
7
8 193 Further, it is unlikely that our results are biased by among-site variation in environmental factors
9
10 194 such as temperature and salinity, which can affect oyster growth and survival both directly (e.g., higher
11
12
13 195 temperature and salinity both tend to increase the growth of oysters; [47] and indirectly (e.g., pressures
14
15 196 from predators and pathogens tend to increase as salinity and temperature increase; [47]. These
16
17 197 environmental variables would have had to covary with oiling levels in order to confound the effects of
18
19
20
198 the oil spill on intertidal oyster populations, but there was no systematic variation in either temperature
21
22 199 or salinity between our control and impact localities over time, based on data from the Coastwide
23
24 200 Reference Monitoring System stations nearest our sampling locations (electronic supplementary
25
26
201 material 2). Another prominent driver of oyster mortality and decreased growth is the pathogen
27
28
29 202 Perkinsus marinus (“Dermo” disease; [48]. As with the salinity and temperature data, however, Dermo
30
31 203 prevalence data from oyster populations near our localities (electronic supplementary material 2; [49]
32
33 204 did not show patterns with oiling levels that could have masked the oil spill’s effects on the studied
34
35
36 205 oyster populations.
37
38 206 Altogether, these results suggest that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill did not affect the body
39
40 207 sizes of intertidal oysters in Louisiana. However, our results should not be taken as an indication that
41
42
43
208 oysters were not exposed to (or consumed) oil-derived materials. Rather, they imply that oyster
44
45 209 populations either recovered rapidly following the immediate impact of the spill, or simply that the
46
47 210 DWH oil spill’s impact on intertidal oyster beds in Louisiana was not severe enough to influence oyster
48
49
211 population dynamics in the short term.

3 214 Our findings of little impact on intertidal oysters in Louisiana are consistent with other studies of oyster
4
5
6 215 populations following the DWH oil spill [9,50]. For instance, Carmichael et al. [50] conducted
7
8 216 experimental transplants of hatchery-reared oysters along the Mississippi-Alabama coastline, and found
9
10 217 that oyster growth was not significantly affected by potential oil exposure. Also, in Barataria Bay and
11
12
13 218 Breton Sound in Louisiana, La Peyre et al. [9] found that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
14
15 219 concentrations were not elevated to levels that would be expected to harm oysters. Xia et al. [51]
16
17 220 presented similar findings from Mississippi, showing that elevated PAH concentrations in oyster tissues
18
19
20
221 following the spill were low overall, and declined relatively rapidly, averaging 34 ng/g (dry weight) in July
21
22 222 and August 2010, and falling to an average of 15 ng/g by September 2010 (although these levels may be
23
24 223 high enough to cause sub-lethal effects in marine invertebrates in some cases; see [52]. Likewise, in a
25
26
224 study of oysters from Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound, Louisiana, Soniat et al. [22] found no evidence
27
28
29 225 of PAH contamination in tissue samples analyzed six months after the DWH oil spill, and a Natural
30
31 226 Resource Damage Assessment report also found that PAH concentrations in oyster tissues following the
32
33 227 DWH oil spill were not elevated above baseline values measured before the spill [53].
34
35
36 228 These findings and ours do not imply, however, that the DWH oil spill had no effect on oyster
37
38
39 229 populations. For instance, oyster densities were lower in 2010-2013 in some regions affected by the
40
41 230 DWH oil spill relative to pre-spill baseline information from 2006-2009, while no difference relative to
42
43 231 2006-2009 baseline data were observed in regions unaffected by the DWH oil spill [11,54]. Further, a
44
45
46
232 variety of emergency response activities resulted in locally severe oyster habitat damage and mortality
47
48 233 [10–13]. In particular, percent cover of oyster shell in nearshore habitats (within 50 meters of the marsh
49
50 234 edge) was reduced, both as a function of the severity of oiling and whether the area was treated to
51
52
235 remove oil [10]. Also, the freshwater diversions from the Mississippi River, which were conducted as
53
54
55 236 part of the emergency response, reduced average salinities to <5ppt across vast portions of northern
56
57 237 Barataria Bay and Black Bay/Breton Sound in Louisiana for more than 30 consecutive days, killing at least

2
3 238 1.1 billion adult-equivalent subtidal oysters [13]. Oyster populations in the areas affected by the
4
5
6 239 diversions are not expected to recover before 2017, due to the combination of direct oyster mortality
7
8 240 and the resulting depressed recruitment, and habitats where sedimentation or oil cleanup activities
9
10 241 made substrates unsuitable for spat settlement may not recover at all without restoration action
11
12
13 242 [10,12].
14
15 243 Despite locally severe impacts of the DWH oil spill on oyster populations, however, overall we
16
17 244 are faced with the counterintuitive result that the largest marine oil spill in United States history
18
19
20
245 apparently did not have widespread effects on many intertidal oyster populations, even those in close
21
22 246 proximity to locations that were heavily oiled. Although identifying the cause of this result is beyond the
23
24 247 scope of our study, one or more factors may help explain it. Possibilities include the weathered state of
25
26
248 much of the oil that reached the coast [1,55], local adaptations of Gulf Coast oysters and their microbial
27
28
29 249 symbionts to natural hydrocarbon exposure [56,57], compensatory production by oyster populations to
30
31 250 make up for increased mortality [58], or that not enough time has passed for the effects to become
32
33 251 apparent [58,59]. See SI Appendix 3 for a more detailed discussion of these and other possible
34
35
36 252 explanations.

39
40 254 (b) The Advantage of Geohistorical Records for Environmental Assessment
41
42
43
255 Finally, our study took a novel step forward methodologically. To our knowledge, this study is the first to
44
45 256 conduct a BACI analysis using baseline data from geohistorical records. Our results highlight the
46
47 257 advantage of using geohistorical records to establish baselines, even multiple years after an
48
49
258 environmental disturbance. The unique time-averaged and time-lagged properties of DAs cause them to
50
51
52 259 retain baseline characteristics of a location over long timescales (decades to centuries). Thus, the use of
53
54 260 data from DAs and other geohistorical records shows promise for addressing the impacts of unplanned
55
56 261 environmental disasters where local baseline data are scarce.

Appendix B
November 2, 2016
Dear Dr. Dunn,
We have submitted our revised manuscript entitled “Geohistorical records indicate no
impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on oyster body size”. We addressed all reviewer
comments and suggested edits. Below (in blue) are our responses to the reviewers’ specific
comments.
Sincerely,
Gregory P. Dietl
Stephen R. Durham

Please see the attached manuscript for my embedded comments.
We have copied Reviewer 1’s comments that were embedded in the manuscript file into
this document for ease of tracking our changes and responses.
"Intertidal" in the micro-tidal estuaries of LA is likely defined very specifically in this context.
It would be helpful to do so here. Your references 1,4, 10 and 11 probably provide that.
We have qualified our use of the term “intertidal” on Line 100 by giving the tidal amplitude
of the areas we sampled instead of using the term “microtidal”, as it is likely a term less
familiar to readers.

Were any mechanical aids used in the excavation? The depth of the excavation suggests
that this was not done by hand.
We have clarified our technique for excavating our oyster samples on Lines 110-112. The
sentences read: “Each sample of live and dead oysters was collected by hand from 30 x 30
cm plots down to approximately 30 cm depth. A steel box with these dimensions was
inserted during excavation to maintain the walls of the holes.”
I agree, and your use of the deep shell layer is a clever way of making a BACI study possible.
Thank you!
I'm not sure what you mean here: "...sampling environmental variability is encouraged."
Perhaps a re-wording/clarification would help.
We have reworded the sentence to improve clarity. The sentence now reads: “These types
of analyses have many advantages, including their ability to handle uneven sampling
designs and to account for natural environmental variability among sites [41]” Lines 148-
149.
It's likely Bay Boudreaux. Please check this. Note the similar error in fig. 1. and fig. 3, and
perhaps elsewhere.
Bay Bourbeux is the correct name of the locality, so we have not changed this throughout
the paper.

The manuscript RSOS-160763 entitled as “Geohistorical records indicate no impact of the
Deepwater Horizon oil spill on oyster body size” by Dietl & Durham looks at pre-spill body-
size baselines for Crassostrea virginica adults from assemblages of dead shells collected
from beds along Louisiana’s coastline and compares these baselines with size data from live
oysters from the same beds which lived through the DWH oil spill and its aftermath. Using a
Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) analysis, the authors found that average body size of
oysters remained relatively unchanged after the DWH oil spill.
Overall, I thought that the methodological approach was novel, sensible and
comprehensive.
Thank you!
I find particularly interesting and promising that the use of geohistorical records of an
oyster reef (i.e. subsurface layers of dead shells that are a several centuries old) can inform
us about the impact of an environmental disaster, particularly where local baseline data are
scarce. This manuscript is well written, fairly straightforward, and concise. I would
recommend this article for publication in Royal Society Open Science as the study uses an
interesting experimental approach and has societal significant relevance that would be of
interest to the readership of RSOS.
I have a few general comments that the authors may want to consider and some minor
comments which are mentioned below:
1°/- One question I have concerns the main finding of the study, i.e. adult oyster growth
was not affected by the DWH oil. Why the section “Possible explanation for lack of oyster
body size change following the DWH oil spill” is presented in the supplementary material
and not included in the discussion page 12 instead? Is it due to some of the journal
formatting requirements (page limits)? In my opinion, this part is essential to attempt to
explain your counterintuitive result, and lies definitely within the scope of the study. As a
result, it should be included in the MS.
We have followed Reviewer 2’s sensible recommendation and have now included the
supplementary discussion of possible explanations for a lack of oyster body size change in
the discussion of our paper. See lines: 250-306.
2°/- On page 5, line 94, you mention that the sites you selected for the study were not
previously subjected to restoration efforts, shell plantings or recent commercial harvesting.
What about the cleaning efforts of oiled sites that followed the spill? Have the “impacted”
sites you chose to study been subject to cleaning efforts? Several studies (Grabowski, 2015;
Powers, 2015a,b) have shown that raking of nearshore habitat to remove oil resulted in
severe oyster mortality and decrease in oyster cover. This decrease in oyster density could
have been beneficial to oyster growth due to a higher food availability, which could explain
the increase of average body size between 2011 and 2012.
To the best of our knowledge, the sites we sampled in “impacted” areas were not subject
to cleaning efforts. We have added a sentence in the methods section making this point
clear for a reader. See line 95. The sentence reads: “In addition, to our knowledge, none of
the sites we sampled were subjected to clean-up activities related to the DWH oil spill.”
3°/- You should mention in the M&M section (maybe line 109?) that sample sizes of live
oysters measured in the LA from Site 2 and site 8 were pretty low in 2012 (n=9) and 2013
(n=7) respectively.
We included oyster abundances for each site and year in electronic supplementary material
1. To make this clear to readers we have inserted a second footnote (line 167) highlighting
where to find these data.
Minor revisions:
Line 94: Footnote is not a reference. Change “harvesting [1]” to “harvesting 1” instead
The reference causing confusion was deleted from line 94. The placement of footnote 1 can
be found on line 85.
Line 251: See question 1°/: I think you should have developed this paragraph further.
We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and have moved text from supplementary
materials to the discussion. See lines 250-306.
References: Formatting of some references are not consistent. For instance, line 293,
reference “2” is presented as “Michel et al.” and reference “3” is a list of authors.
We double checked our references and the use of et al. We followed the author guidelines
for Royal Society Open Science, which requires et al. for more than 10 authors.
Table 1: Some superscripts are missing: e.g. * or †
Good catch! We have added the superscripts to the table.
