The reviewed manuscript presents interesting and novel findings on the influence of pathogens
such as protozoan parasites (Haemosporida and Coccidia, Eucoccidiorida), bacteria, and
helminths on populations declines of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in Lindon, UK. The
paper is well written and well structured. However, I think that section “1. Introduction” have to
be expanded and more informative. Perhaps the following studies worth citing and discussion:
Loiseau, C., Zoorob, R., Robert, A., Chastel, O., Julliard, R. & Sorci, G. (2011) Plasmodium
relictum infection and MHC diversity in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Proceedings.

Parasitology 100, 59–65.

loss, and gain of malaria parasites in a globally invasive bird. PloS one 6, e21905.
For me was also quite difficult to move between methodology in the section “2. Methods” and
supplementary materials S1-S4 in order to get familiar with it. I would recommend if possible
gathering them together.
Another questionable part of the methodology is how Atoxoplasma and Isospora species was
differentiated despite the discussion on L210-216. Since Atoxoplasma was suggested as junior
synonym of Isospora, how they were separated based on the blood smears or fecal samples?
The scientific terminology was not always appropriately used. For example L 161 “intensity of
parasitism” Perhaps you mean intensity of infection or parasitaemia? For blood parasites
"parasitaemia" is more commonly used. I would recommend the following paper to solve similar
issues:
Bush, A.O., Lafferty, K.D., Lotz, J.M. & Shostak, A.W. (1997) Parasitology meets ecology on its
own terms: Macrogolis et al. Revisited. Journal of Parasitology 83, 575–583.
Line 268 “inoculation dose”, please note that infection initiated via artificial inoculation with
infected blood and via vector bite are different techniques and it is not correct to compare them
equally! On L 272 you have multiple inoculations with sporozoites of P. relictum, which is not the
same as studies 45 and 46. In my opinion it worth discussing the abundance of vectors of P.
relictum, Culex pipiens if you have such data for the different sparrow populations in your study
rather than compare with experimental infections initiated with inoculation of infected blood.

Abstract:
A couple wording suggestions:
Line 22: "Populations of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) have declined in many European
towns and cities, but the causes of these declines remain unclear."
Line 26: "Plasmodium relictum infection was found at higher prevalences (averaging 74%) in
suburban London house sparrows than previously recorded in any wild bird population in
Northern Europe."
Line 31: "Our findings indicate that P. relictum infection may be influencing house sparrow
population dynamics in suburban areas."
Introduction:
Starts well with broad themes, but the focus needs to narrow down to the present study. The
third sentence of the first paragraph (Line 42) is vague, what are the potential demographic
impacts of parasites on birds?
Also, avian malaria is in the paper's title, but there is no mention of it in the Introduction.
Introduce Plasmodium perhaps around Line 52 when mentioning parasites are generally
understudied as a potential cause of avian population declines.
Wording:
Line 45: "The house sparrow (Passer domesticus, hereafter sparrow) used to be one of the most
common species of bird in the United Kingdom (UK) ..."
Methods
Line 64: States the study was conducted between November 2006 and September 2009 but section
(b) of Methods says surveys of male sparrows were completed between 2005 and 2009. Does it
matter for this study that annual surveys of male sparrows were conducted a year before this
study began?
Line 67: Is 4 km a significant distance for house sparrow populations or is this just a minimum
distance between study populations?
Line 87: Was data from the “pilot study” used in the analysis?
Line 90: Write out full years: 2007/2008 and 2008/2009
Lines 96-97: You state you identified the relative abundance of parasites in each faecal sample
(but not swab). What are the swabs you are referring to here?
Line 125: Wording – “Separate analyses were conducted first based on infection rates of all birds,
and then of adults and juveniles separately. Too few individuals were sexed to allow sex-specific
4
analyses.
Line 137: Add “n =” in front of 117 when reporting sample size
Lines 166-169: Run-on sentence. Each statement here should be in a single sentence.
Section (c): Report sample size with all statistics
Results:
Line 176: You report there was no association between prevalence of Plasmodium and local
sparrow population growth in the Discussion but this should also be reported here in the Results.
Line 228: You switch from “juveniles and adults” to “adults and first years”. Stay consistent.
Line 235: Plasmodium lineages cannot be “globally widespread” and “endemic to the UK”.
Perhaps use “native” instead of “endemic” here?
Discussion:
In the Introduction you mentioned the multiple hypotheses put forth to explain house sparrow
decline. It might be informative to discuss those studies in the Discussion, especially if some of
those factors may be contributing to the overall decline along with avian malaria.
Line 245: Bichet et al.?
Line 269: Are you referring to house sparrows or more broadly to sparrows as a family? Either
way, specify here.
Line 270: Full species name is European starling.
Line 271: Atkinson et al.?
Line 277: This paragraph does not fit well here without prior introduction. This information
either needs to be presented in the Methods and Results sections, or not at all. It might be more
appropriate as a stand-alone publication such as a “Short Communication”.
Line 296: Wording – “Inbreeding coefficient has been associated with a high level of
homozygosity in sparrows [50], therefore individuals with lower heterozygosity may be less able
to mount an immune response [51].
Tables and Figures:
Figure 1: Figures should be able to stand-alone, title needs more description – “Map of house
sparrow (Passer domesticus) study sites in London, indicating whether or not counts of territorial
male house sparrows showed a declining trend over the period 2005-2009”.
Figure 2: Figure should stand-alone. Report that parasite prevalence and intensity was measured
in house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Report what the line represents in figure a) in the
description. Also report that each symbol represents a distinct house sparrow population. This
might read better as two separate figures.
Figure 3: “Relationship between intensity of Plasmodium relictum infection and monthly survival
of (a) juvenile and (b) adult house sparrows (Passer domesticus), illustrating the age*plasmodium
survival model with independent slopes (Model 2 Table S4). Ticks on the x-axis indicate infection
intensity per individual sparrow.”
Table 1: Use the percent sign when reporting each percent. You’ve placed the percent sign in the
column titles but I think it would be clearer to write it out next to each percentage.

Major revision is needed (please make suggestions in comments)
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Major comments:
L. 28-30 – That other parasites were less prevalent and no relationship with house sparrow
survival, etc. assumes that co-infection is always ‘negative’ where some (limited) literature
suggests that the negative effects of co-infection do not worsen additively with each new parasite
infection. Consider addressing this briefly in the Discussion paragraph starting at L. 244.
Analyses – I appreciate the care that was taken in investigating the effects of parasitism on house
sparrows. However, several issues emerged that should be considered to make the analytical
approach and inferences derived from it stronger. These include addressing the following:
A) L.122-123 – How were the analyses (models) weighted by prevalence or intensity? This was
confusing to me.
B) L. 130 – What was the CJS ‘extension’ that was used? (May be simply “CJS model”)
C) CJS modeling approach – If I understood correctly, the mark-recapture analyses had two
phases. One was to ask about the ecological factors associated with apparent survival and
detection. Why take this stepped approach? Consider providing additional detail and reasoning
for this approach directly in the MS. Related, as I understand it, the infection intensity values
were those determined using the blood sample taken when the birds were first caught and
banded. Couldn’t infection intensity change over the course of the study? It IS interesting that
survival varies with infection intensity and age but are infection intensity and age correlated? If
so, the inferences about age and intensity get complicated. Also, what about the simple
relationship between infection status at first capture and apparent survival? This seems like an
important question that is not addressed but could be easily.
D) Mixing paradigms – Avoid mixing the information-theoretic (IT) approaches used to report
the capture-recapture model selection results with null hypothesis testing that is used for the
population growth analyses. Consider reworking the population growth analyses in an IT
framework; this allows discussion of the weight of evidence for competing models and lets the
factors of interest ‘duke it out’ with respect to which one or ones best explain the variation in the
data. This approach also allows a deeper analysis of the combinations of factors – including
infection intensity - that might be associated with changes in population size (is it size or is it
growth like lambda?) A minor point – significance wording is not needed when reporting effect
sizes from the ‘best model’ under an IT framework—that veers into mixing paradigms within the
same analysis instead of just within the same paper. The NO2 analyses could also be done in an
IT framework. Consider consulting Anderson 2007 - Model Based Inference in the Life Sciences:
A Primer on Evidence and associated material for more on analyses in an IT framework.

Minor edits to consider:
L. 30 – Add “was shown” after “abundance”
L. 50 – Add “negative” before “impacts of pollutants”
L.57 – 73% here is different than the value cited in the Abstract (72%)
L. 68 – consider replacing “travel” with “disperse”; when I first read it I thought to myself “They
travel a lot through flight...maybe kilometers in a day”
L.189 – “AIC support” would be better stated as “Akaike weight” or “AICc weight” (the AICc is
the small sample size corrected form of AIC and is often used almost by default because AIC =
AICc when sample sizes are large)
L. 250 – correct spelling to “exception”
L. 307 – consider replacing “reduced” with “decreased”

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Cynthia Downs):
The manuscript “Avian malaria-mediated population decline of a widespread iconic bird
species” was reviewed by 3 expert reviewers and myself. The study presented in the manuscript
uses traditional population ecology techniques and demographic modeling to assess the influence
of parasites on the decline of house sparrow populations in Lindon, UK. The finding that
infection intensity of Plasmodium relictum was negatively related to survival rates of juvenile
and adult sparrows and population growth rate in exciting. The manuscript was generally well
written and enjoyable to read.
I suggest extending the introduction to provide more context for how the current study fits into
the literature as suggested by two of the reviewers. I also recommend addressing the comments
made by reviewer 3 about the statistical modeling approach. Particularly with regards to
clarifying the statistical methods used and reviewer 3’s suggestion to apply an information-
theoretic approach to analyse population growth. In addition, the models used to develop the
model-averaged best model for survival included the model set within 2 delta AICs of the top
model. It is more common to use the model set within 4 delta AICs of the top model. Please
explore this more conservative approach to ensure that it does not change the interpretation of
the data. Also, please address the suggestions from the reviewers about clarifying methods that
are important for interpreting the scientific soundness of the study presented.
This manuscript has the potential inform our understanding of whether avian malaria has
contributed to the decline of house sparrows in the United Kingdom.

L.189 – “AIC support” would be better stated as “Akaike weight” or “AICc weight” (the AICc is
the small sample size corrected form of AIC and is often used almost by default because AIC =
AICc when sample sizes are large)
L. 250 – correct spelling to “exception”
L. 307 – consider replacing “reduced” with “decreased”

The manuscript was significantly improved from its previous version. However, I think the
Introduction is still too short and lacking of information. In my opinion, some parts from the
large Discussion might be modified and moved to the Introduction, as for example the last
paragraph of the Discussion (L408-432).
The terminology use is still not appropriate on some places (L58, L62). Please be aware that
"parasitaemia " and "infection intensity" have the same meaning in parasitology. I would
recommend to stay consistent and use one of the terms. For blood parasites "parasitaemia" is
more commonly used.
Why I could not find supplementary Table 2? Is it wrongly entitled as TableS 3?

Editor comments:
Thanks for your revisions. As you see, one reviewer is satisfied, but the other one and our AE are
not yet. Please be aware that if in your revision you do not address all queries successfully we
will not be able to continue the manuscript further, because it would be the second resubmission.
Best success in your revisions.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Cynthia Downs):
Thank you for resubmitting “Avian malaria-mediated population decline of a widespread iconic
bird species.” The revised manuscript was reviewed by two of the reviewers who reviewed the
original submission and me. In general, the reviewers were satisfied with the revisions that were
made to the manuscript. Although the reviewer that raised concerns about the statistics included
in the original manuscript did not review the revisions, I am satisfied with the explanation as to
why two statistical frameworks were used to analyze their data.
Reviewer two raised concerns that the introduction doesn’t provide enough context for the study,
specifically with regards to investigations about the decline of house sparrow population in the
United Kingdom. Please expand the introduction. Please also address reviewer two’s comments
about the uses of the terms parasite infection, parasitaemia, and infection intensity and address
their line comments about the methods detailed in the PDF they provide.
It appears that you collected data of abundance for each population (methods presented in 79-93),
but these data are not presented in the results. These measures would provide an index of your
sampling effort and could help strengthen the conclusions drawn from the results. Please include
these data as a table or figure in an electronic supplement and discuss them in relation to the
other results presented.
Finally, as noted by reviewer two, Table S2 appears to be missing from the supplementary
material. Please rectify this in your next submission or explain why it has not been included.
I greatly enjoyed reading this revision.
Best regards,
Cynthia Downs

Appendix A
Response to the Associate Editor.
- I suggest extending the introduction to provide more context for how the current study fits
into the literature as suggested by two of the reviewers.
We have extended the Introduction, as suggested.
- I also recommend addressing the comments made by reviewer 3 about the statistical
modeling approach. Particularly with regards to clarifying the statistical methods used and
reviewer 3’s suggestion to apply an information-theoretic approach to analyse population
growth.
We have replied to the reviewer’s comment below.
- In addition, the models used to develop the model-averaged best model for survival
included the model set within 2 delta AICs of the top model. It is more common to use the
model set within 4 delta AICs of the top model. Please explore this more conservative
approach to ensure that it does not change the interpretation of the data.
We have considered models within 4 delta AICs. The results and their interpretation have
not changed.
- Also, please address the suggestions from the reviewers about clarifying methods that are
important for interpreting the scientific soundness of the study presented.
We have addressed those comments, more details below.
Response to Reviewers.
Reviewer: 1
- The reviewed manuscript presents interesting and novel findings on the influence of
pathogens such as protozoan parasites (Haemosporida and Coccidia, Eucoccidiorida),
bacteria, and helminths on populations declines of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in
Lindon, UK. The paper is well written and well structured. However, I think that section “1.
Introduction” have to be expanded and more informative. Perhaps the following studies
worth citing and discussion:
We thank the reviewer for these positive comments and suggestions.

Added in the Discussion (Line 320).
- Marzal, A., Ricklefs, R.E., Valkiunas, G., Albayrak, T., Arriero, E., Bonneaud, C., Czirják, G.

Bensch, S. (2011) Diversity, loss, and gain of malaria parasites in a globally invasive bird.
PloS one 6, e21905.
Whilst a very interesting reference, we did not add it because we found it difficult to
contextualise it. It focuses on house sparrows as an invasive species and their having fewer
haemoparasites than in their native range, a topic that was not covered in our manuscript.
- For me was also quite difficult to move between methodology in the section “2. Methods”
and supplementary materials S1-S4 in order to get familiar with it. I would recommend if
possible gathering them together.
We have combined the text in S1-S4 with the main Methodology.
- Another questionable part of the methodology is how Atoxoplasma and Isospora species
was differentiated despite the discussion on L210-216. Since Atoxoplasma was suggested
as junior synonym of Isospora, how they were separated based on the blood smears or fecal
samples?
We have moved the explanation of how Atoxoplasma and Isospora were identified from the
Discussion to the Methodology and we have added extra clarification (Lines 158-162).
Although considered to be the same parasite, the two names are used to differentiate the
intestinal phase (Isospora) and the blood phase (Atoxoplasma),
- The scientific terminology was not always appropriately used. For example L 161 “intensity
of parasitism” Perhaps you mean intensity of infection or parasitaemia? For blood parasites
"parasitaemia" is more commonly used. I would recommend the following paper to solve
similar issues:
Bush, A.O., Lafferty, K.D., Lotz, J.M. & Shostak, A.W. (1997) Parasitology meets ecology on
its own terms: Macrogolis et al. Revisited. Journal of Parasitology 83, 575–583.
We have changed “parasitism” for “parasitaemia” in most case, aside from when we
considered “intensity of infection” to be more appropriate.
- Line 268 “inoculation dose”, please note that infection initiated via artificial inoculation with
infected blood and via vector bite are different techniques and it is not correct to compare
them equally! On L 272 you have multiple inoculations with sporozoites of P. relictum, which
is not the same as studies 45 and 46.
We agree and we have modified the text accordingly (Lines 375-379).
- In my opinion it worth discussing the abundance of vectors of P. relictum, Culex pipiens if
you have such data for the different sparrow populations in your study rather than compare
with experimental infections initiated with inoculation of infected blood.
Unfortunately we do not have the data but we agree that it would be very interesting to look
at C. pipiens abundance across the different house sparrow populations. We have added
this point to the Discussion (Line 369).
Reviewer: 2
Abstract:
A couple wording suggestions:
- Line 22: "Populations of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) have declined in many
European towns and cities, but the causes of these declines remain unclear."
Text modified accordingly (Lines 21-23).
- Line 26: "Plasmodium relictum infection was found at higher prevalences (averaging 74%)
in suburban London house sparrows than previously recorded in any wild bird population in
Northern Europe."
Text modified accordingly (Lines 25-27).
- Line 31: "Our findings indicate that P. relictum infection may be influencing house sparrow
population dynamics in suburban areas."
Text modified accordingly (Lines 31-32).
Introduction:
- Starts well with broad themes, but the focus needs to narrow down to the present study.
The third sentence of the first paragraph (Line 42) is vague, what are the potential
demographic impacts of parasites on birds?
We have clarified this point (Line 41-45) and added more explicit examples (Lines 46-50).
- Also, avian malaria is in the paper's title, but there is no mention of it in the Introduction.
Introduce Plasmodium perhaps around Line 52 when mentioning parasites are generally
understudied as a potential cause of avian population declines.
It is now mentioned more explicitly amongst the examples of potential demographic impact
on birds (Line 46).
Wording:
- Line 45: "The house sparrow (Passer domesticus, hereafter sparrow) used to be one of the
most common species of bird in the United Kingdom (UK) ..."
Text modified accordingly (Lines 52-53). We have also changed “common” with “abundant”.
Methods
- Line 64: States the study was conducted between November 2006 and September 2009
but section (b) of Methods says surveys of male sparrows were completed between 2005
and 2009. Does it matter for this study that annual surveys of male sparrows were
conducted a year before this study began?
Yes, that is correct. The annual surveys measured change in house sparrow abundance
between 2005 and 2009, and the parallel parasitology work was conducted between 2006
and 2009. It was useful to have as many years as possible contributing to our measure of
colony growth rate.
- Line 67: Is 4 km a significant distance for house sparrow populations or is this just a
minimum distance between study populations?
This was the minimum distance between neighbouring colonies and it is useful to quote to
demonstrate that our study colonies were probably demographically isolated from each
other. Natal and breeding dispersal rarely exceed 2km in this species. We have modified the
text to clarify this point (Lines 75-76).
- Line 87: Was data from the “pilot study” used in the analysis?
No, it wasn’t, as it had taken place only at one site
- Line 90: Write out full years: 2007/2008 and 2008/2009
Text modified accordingly (Lines 113-114).
- Lines 96-97: You state you identified the relative abundance of parasites in each faecal
sample (but not swab). What are the swabs you are referring to here?
We are referring to cloacal swabs, which were used only for bacteriology as their tip, which
had faecal matter, had been preserved in charcoal medium and hence was not suitable for
parasitology. We were clarifying that swabs had not been used for parasitology. We have
combined the supplementary material Methodology with the main text and we have added a
short clarification within the parenthesis (Lines 125-126).
- Line 125: Wording – “Separate analyses were conducted first based on infection rates of all
birds, and then of adults and juveniles separately. Too few individuals were sexed to allow
sex-specific analyses.
Text modified accordingly (Lines 188-192). We have inserted an additional sentence splitting
the two.
- Line 137: Add “n =” in front of 117 when reporting sample size
Text modified accordingly (Line 202).
- Lines 166-169: Run-on sentence. Each statement here should be in a single sentence.
Text modified accordingly (Lines 257-262).
- Section (c): Report sample size with all statistics
Text modified accordingly (Lines 265-279).
Results:
- Line 176: You report there was no association between prevalence of Plasmodium and
local sparrow population growth in the Discussion but this should also be reported here in
the Results.
Text modified accordingly (Lines 267-269).
- Line 228: You switch from “juveniles and adults” to “adults and first years”. Stay consistent.
Text modified accordingly. We use “juvenile” throughout.
- Line 235: Plasmodium lineages cannot be “globally widespread” and “endemic to the UK”.
Perhaps use “native” instead of “endemic” here?
Text modified accordingly (Line 337).
Discussion:
- In the Introduction you mentioned the multiple hypotheses put forth to explain house
sparrow decline. It might be informative to discuss those studies in the Discussion,
especially if some of those factors may be contributing to the overall decline along with avian
malaria.
Text modified accordingly (Lines 408-432).
- Line 245: Bichet et al.?
Changed as suggested (Line 347)
- Line 269: Are you referring to house sparrows or more broadly to sparrows as a family?
Either way, specify here.
We refer to house sparrows. In the Introduction (Line 52) we have specified that we would
call them “sparrow” from then on.
- Line 270: Full species name is European starling.
Text modified accordingly (Line 374).
- Line 271: Atkinson et al.?
Changed as suggested (Line 377)
- Line 277: This paragraph does not fit well here without prior introduction. This information
either needs to be presented in the Methods and Results sections, or not at all. It might be
more appropriate as a stand-alone publication such as a “Short Communication”.
We have now moved text from the Supplementary Material to introduce testing for an effect
of air pollution in the Methods (Lines 214-233) and Results (Lines 294-299) sections. This
now flows through Methods to Results and Discussion.
- Line 296: Wording – “Inbreeding coefficient has been associated with a high level of
homozygosity in sparrows [50], therefore individuals with lower heterozygosity may be less
able to mount an immune response [51].
Text modified accordingly (Lines 404-406)
Tables and Figures:
- Figure 1: Figures should be able to stand-alone, title needs more description – “Map of
house sparrow (Passer domesticus) study sites in London, indicating whether or not counts
of territorial male house sparrows showed a declining trend over the period 2005-2009”.
Text modified accordingly
- Figure 2: Figure should stand-alone. Report that parasite prevalence and intensity was
measured in house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Report what the line represents in figure
a) in the description. Also report that each symbol represents a distinct house sparrow
population. This might read better as two separate figures.
The Figure heading has been changed accordingly. The two graphs have been kept as part
of the same figure as we feel it renders the contrast between prevalence and intensity easier
to visualise.
- Figure 3: “Relationship between intensity of Plasmodium relictum infection and monthly
survival of (a) juvenile and (b) adult house sparrows (Passer domesticus), illustrating the
age*plasmodium survival model with independent slopes (Model 2 Table S4). Ticks on the x-
axis indicate infection intensity per individual sparrow.”
Figure heading changed as suggested.
- Table 1: Use the percent sign when reporting each percent. You’ve placed the percent sign
in the column titles but I think it would be clearer to write it out next to each percentage.
Percentage sign added.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
Major comments:
- L. 28-30 – That other parasites were less prevalent and no relationship with house sparrow
survival, etc. assumes that co-infection is always ‘negative’ where some (limited) literature
suggests that the negative effects of co-infection do not worsen additively with each new
parasite infection. Consider addressing this briefly in the Discussion paragraph starting at L.
244.
Consideration of this has been added to the Discussion with examples provided (Line 354)
-Analyses – I appreciate the care that was taken in investigating the effects of parasitism on
house sparrows. However, several issues emerged that should be considered to make the
analytical approach and inferences derived from it stronger. These include addressing the
following:
37) A) L.122-123 – How were the analyses (models) weighted by prevalence or intensity?
This was confusing to me.
We have clarified this point in the text (Lines 187-188). Weighting of observations within
GLMs like this is a fairly standard statistical technique.
- B) L. 130 – What was the CJS ‘extension’ that was used? (May be simply “CJS model”)
Yes, it was just CJS model, and we have modified the text accordingly (Line 195).
- C) CJS modeling approach – If I understood correctly, the mark-recapture analyses had
two phases. One was to ask about the ecological factors associated with apparent survival
and detection. Why take this stepped approach? Consider providing additional detail and
reasoning for this approach directly in the MS. Related, as I understand it, the infection
intensity values were those determined using the blood sample taken when the birds were
first caught and banded. Couldn’t infection intensity change over the course of the study? It
IS interesting that survival varies with infection intensity and age but are infection intensity
and age correlated? If so, the inferences about age and intensity get complicated. Also, what
about the simple relationship between infection status at first capture and apparent survival?
This seems like an important question that is not addressed but could be easily.
We have taken a two-step approach (model simplification followed by testing for parasite
effects) in order to maximise statistical power at the second stage. This is a standard
approach in such survival analyses. We have modified the text to clarify our approach (Lines
206-207).
We agree that infection intensity could change over the course of the study and we would
have liked to test this, but too few sparrows were captured to allow such an analysis. Mean
intensity of infection was higher in juveniles (mean Plasmodium= 24) than adults (mean
Plasmodium=12), but we show a similar negative relationship existed between survival and
plasmodium intensity for both age classes (Fig 3).
We feel the relationship between infectious status (infected/not infected) and apparent
survival would have less resolution than our current approach and probably be difficult to
interpret. This is because in a category “infected”, for example, we would combine house
sparrows that had very low intensity with those individuals with high intensity. Should the
result show that simply being infected does not significantly reduce chances of survival, it
would have to be interpreted as a spurious result because it would go against the more
detailed analyses that take intensity of infection into consideration and which show that at
high levels intensity of infection does decrease survival probability. If, on the other hand,
results showed that being infected is enough to have lower chances of survival, it would give
a less-comprehensive picture than the current intensity-based survival analysis provides.
- D) Mixing paradigms – Avoid mixing the information-theoretic (IT) approaches used to
report the capture-recapture model selection results with null hypothesis testing that is used
for the population growth analyses. Consider reworking the population growth analyses in an
IT framework; this allows discussion of the weight of evidence for competing models and lets
the factors of interest ‘duke it out’ with respect to which one or ones best explain the
variation in the data. This approach also allows a deeper analysis of the combinations of
factors – including infection intensity - that might be associated with changes in population
size (is it size or is it growth like lambda?) A minor point – significance wording is not needed
when reporting effect sizes from the ‘best model’ under an IT framework—that veers into
mixing paradigms within the same analysis instead of just within the same paper.
Ideally we would have preferred to avoid mixing paradigms by applying an IT framework to
the population growth analyses as suggested, but it was technically impossible to do this
because sample size differed between models (AIC is only comparable across models when
the underlying data structure remains constant but we lacked measures of several age-
specific parasite metrics at some colonies). We recognise that this was not clear in the
manuscript and we have tried to clarify this point (Lines 190-191). In particular, prevalence
and intensity of infection in juveniles are modelled on two fewer sites than the other models,
because no juveniles were successfully sampled at those sites. This prevented us using an
IT framework on population growth analyses, since the juvenile models are pivotal to the
argument put forward in this manuscript.
We then considered dropping the IT framework from the survival analyses in order to avoid
mixing paradigms between different analyses. However, we could not see a defendable way
of conducting our survival analysis without using an AIC-based approach. For example, how
would we have identified a base model against which to assess the effects of parasite
status?. We therefore retained the AIC approach in the survival analyses, which is standard
practice for studies of this type. We have been careful not to mix paradigms within any given
analysis and, whilst we recognise that not mixing paradigms within a single MS would be
ideal, there are many contemporary studies (including in Open Science) that are forced to do
this for different analyses within a single paper.
- The NO2 analyses could also be done in an IT framework. Consider consulting Anderson
2007 - Model Based Inference in the Life Sciences: A Primer on Evidence and associated
material for more on analyses in an IT framework.
The same technical problem to that described above applies here too: due to differences in
sample size we could not adopt an IT framework for these analyses.
Minor edits to consider:
- L. 30 – Add “was shown” after “abundance”
The sentence has been modified and split into two for clarity (Lines 28-30)
- L. 50 – Add “negative” before “impacts of pollutants”
Text modified accordingly (Line 57).
- L.57 – 73% here is different than the value cited in the Abstract (72%)
Text has been updated with the latest figures (Line 64).
- L. 68 – consider replacing “travel” with “disperse”; when I first read it I thought to myself
“They travel a lot through flight...maybe kilometers in a day”
We have specified that we were talking about natal and breeding dispersal to clarify that we
are referring to adult movements (Lines 74-76).
- L.189 – “AIC support” would be better stated as “Akaike weight” or “AICc weight” (the AICc
is the small sample size corrected form of AIC and is often used almost by default because
AIC = AICc when sample sizes are large)
Text modified accordingly (Line 283).
- L. 250 – correct spelling to “exception”
Text modified accordingly (Line 352)
- L. 307 – consider replacing “reduced” with “decreased”
Text modified accordingly (Line 441).
Appendix B
Response to the Associate Editor.
- It appears that you collected data of abundance for each population (methods presented in
79-93), but these data are not presented in the results. These measures would provide an
index of your sampling effort and could help strengthen the conclusions drawn from the
results. Please include these data as a table or figure in an electronic supplement and
discuss them in relation to the other results presented.
Thank you for your comment. The abundance data were already presented as an integral
part of the results (Results sections (c) and (e), Fig. 2 and Table 3), which show that cross-
colony variation in growth rates through time is correlated to Plasmodium intensity of
infection (Figure 2b). We agree, though, that it may assist the reader to have access to the
raw data from the house sparrow survey, so have added it as a supplementary table, now
Table S1. The proportion of birds sampled in each colony compared to the colony count can
be inferred from comparing Table S1 and Table S3, but we did not feel it warrant a specific
mention in the main manuscript.
Response to Reviewers.
Reviewer 1
-I think the Introduction is still too short and lacking of information. In my opinion, some parts
from the large Discussion might be modified and moved to the Introduction, as for example
the last paragraph of the Discussion (L408-432).
Thank you for your suggestion, we have moved the last paragraph of the Discussion to the
Introduction (Lines 57-79 ).
- Please be aware that “parasitaemia” and “infection intensity” have the same meaning in
parasitology. I would recommend to stay consistent and use one of the terms. Furthermore,
for me is not clear in the sentence what you mean under “parasitaemia” and “infection
intensity” (L62). […]
Thank you for your comment. Parasitaemia simply means the presence of parasites in the
blood (e.g. Gabra, M.S., Grossiord, D., Perrin, L.H., Shaw, A., Cheung, A. and McGregor,
I.A., 1986. Defined Plasmodium falciparum antigens in malaria serology. Bulletin of the
World Health Organization, 64(6), p.891) and this is the sense in which we use the term. We
recognise, however, that it is increasingly used to mean parasite ‘abundance’ or ‘intensity’ of
infection in clinical journals, therefore we have changed “parasitaemia” to “infection intensity”
(or “intensity of infection”) throughout the manuscript except where the term “parasitism”
better depicted the required meaning.
We have also modified the last sentence of the Introduction, as suggested, to make it clearer
that we are referring to parasite infection (“parasitism”) and subsequently to intensity of
infection. (Lines 81-82)
- How long the fixated smears were stored before staining? (Line 147)
They were stained the next day in most cases but at peak times some slides were stained a
few days later. The text has been amended to state that slides were stained within a week.
(Line 166)
- Do you mean tested positive for Plasmodium sp, based on blood smears? How these 29
individuals were selected? Did you use equal samples from each study site, host age or
sex? (Line 165)
The 29 samples were selected from positive ones as seen from blood smears, now clarified
in the text (Lines 185-186). The 29 individuals were selected to represent all sites in roughly
equal numbers (text modified accordingly, Line 185), although they were arbitrarily chosen
among those available for each site and from which we had a large enough blood sample.
Also, we ensured that we included adults and juveniles of both sexes).
- Was the overall prevalence estimated based on blood smears only? (Line 251)
Yes, it was based on microscopy, we have now specified this in the text (Lines 271-272).
- Plasmodium in italic (Line 322 and 354)
Thank you, they have been rectified (Lines 342 and 374 ).
- I think this paragraph (Lines 408-432 ) can be easily moved in the Introduction section to
give better background on the main aim of the study.
Thank you for your suggestion, we have moved the paragraph you have suggested to the
Introduction (Lines 57-79).
- Why I could not find supplementary Table 2? Is it wrongly entitled as Tables 3?
Our apologies, indeed it was mis-labelled and it was the file erroneously named Table S3.
We have now added a table in the supplementary material, therefore the table is now
correctly named Table S3.
Reviewer 2
Thank you for taking the time to thoughtfully address and respond to reviewer comments
and suggestions. Looking forward to seeing this manuscript published.
Thank you very much for your input.
