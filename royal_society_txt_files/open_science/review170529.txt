The authors extend a large-population model of stress-induced mutagenesis (SIM) to include cell-
to-cell communication (quorum sensing, qSIM). The key findings of the paper are summed up in
Figure 4. In an environment where selection fluctuates, they find that, under head-to-head
competition, qSIM is favored under a large fraction of parameter space, and that non-mutator
(NM) phenotypes are favored only when the rate of environmental change is extremely slow.
This study makes an interesting point, and I think it is a meaningful advance in our
understanding of microbial mutagenesis. One thing that is not included, which the authors may
want to consider including (and probably have, I suspect), is the parameter space in which a new
modifier of mutation (NM, SIM, qSIM) can invade. The 50:50 head-to-head competition seems a
bit artificial, although the point it makes is clear.
Other than that, I think this paper is clearly written and the results and discussion are sensible.

In this manuscript, Dellus-Gur and colleagues explore how different stress-responsive regulatory
schemes affect the fitness advantage provided by stress-induced mutagenesis (SIM). This follows
in the footsteps of previous work by the group showing that the regulation of mutation rate in
response to stress (by cellular stress-response pathways) is advantageous in populations of
asexual cells and can evolve through second-order selection. This manuscript expands on the
previous work by adding complexity to the model—what if cellular stress responses do not
always accurately represent the presence/absence of stress? This is an interesting and important
question and I think that the authors’ finding that SIM is relatively robust to moderate errors in
regulation should be emphasized more. Additionally, the authors model an alternative regulation
strategy, quorum sensing, and conclude that it is even more beneficial than traditional, cell-
autonomous regulation of SIM. This study raises and addresses interesting questions, but there
3
are some issues with the underlying premise, the description of the models, and the connection to
published experimental findings.
Major concerns:
1. The stress-sensing strategies explored in the models need to be more clearly defined in the text,
as they are the key concept explored in this work. Descriptions in different parts of the
manuscript seem somewhat contradictory. My best guess is that individuals regulate SIM in the
traditional cell-autonomous manner when population fitness is low, but that the degree of SIM
response is decreased by quorum-sensing signals when population fitness is high. In this case, is
the cell-autonomous regulation error-prone, but the quorum-sensing regulation error-free? If they
are both error-prone, why is qSIM expected and then shown to “mitigate” errors in regulation. A
careful dissection of the mathematical model can probably answer these questions, but they
should also be clarified in the text to make the study more widely accessible.
2. The general statement “biological systems tend to be error-prone” (line 18) needs to be
substantiated with references to the existing literature on the stochasticity of transcription
regulation in bacteria (J Paulsson and I Golding labs, and others), and other related literature.
Similarly, the error rates chosen in the models need to be put into context of what is known
experimentally.
3. Many examples of SIM have been identified in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
organisms, as stated in the manuscript. However, no examples of “quorum-sensing SIM” (qSIM)
have been reported. The authors should address this discrepancy. Do the authors think that these
systems are common in nature and have just not been discovered? If so, why not and where
might we need to look to find them? The experiments proposed in the final paragraph (lines 222-
226) are overly simplified and make a lot of assumptions about quorum sensing (that all bacteria
do it, that it controls the stress responses already known to regulate SIM, etc).
4. In the models presented, SIM is only advantageous over qSIM in a small parameter space. But
without rooting the parameters (such as error-rate, discussed above, or rate of environmental
change) in experimental data, it is hard to interpret the results. Maybe the combination of
parameters where SIM is preferred are also the most common in nature. This could be another
explanation for why qSIM has not evolved and/or observed experimentally.
Minor concerns
1. MSB needs to be defined the first time it is used (line 98). The abbreviation is not introduced
until the next section (line 117).
2. Line 176: “summaries” should be “summarizes”

thank the reviewers for the helpful, informative comments. We revised the manuscript
ordingly. Please see our point by point responses to the reviewers’ comments below.

-to-cell communication (quorum sensing, qSIM). The key findings of the paper are summed
in Figure 4. In an environment where selection fluctuates, they find that, under head-to-head

er than that, I think this paper is clearly written and the results and discussion are sensible.
ponse:
wish to thank the reviewer for that comment. We run additional simulations, similarly to the
petition simulations, except that qSIM starts from rarity - 1% of the total population. The
ults are qualitatively robust to this change. The results were added to the Supplementary
eriel (new Figure S2), and are described in the relevant places in the main text.
viewer 2:
ink that the authors’ finding that SIM is relatively robust to moderate errors in regulation
uld be emphasized more.
ponse:
emphasized the robustness of SIM to stress throughout the text (P.7 line 143, P.10 line 225).

ponse is decreased by quorum-sensing signals when population fitness is high.
ponse:
clarified that point in the introduction (P. 4 line 45). We now explain that we view the
vation of mutagenesis under qSIM as requiring two signals – stress at the level of the
ividual (like classical SIM) plus low mean fitness, corresponding to stress at the level of the
re population (P.4 line 47).

his case, is the cell-autonomous regulation error-prone, but the quorum-sensing regulation

rs in regulation. A careful dissection of the mathematical model can probably answer these
stions, but they should also be clarified in the text to make the study more widely accessible.

added a discussion regarding this issue in the model section (P.6 line 106).
