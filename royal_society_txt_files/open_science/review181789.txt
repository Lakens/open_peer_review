The paper is interesting. But author is provided the materials information perfectly and
introduction the articles is not significant to highlight their work. So, the present form of the
paper is not publishable. After addressing below point successfully, the paper can be considered
for publication.
1. Introduction of the paper is not sufficient to highlight the novelty of the work. As for example,
TiO2-CdS composite photo reduction works by other groups are completely hidden. SO, author
should describe this part in introduction to show the novelty of their work.
2. Need high resolution FESEM image of Figure 1c. Figure 1b magnification and Figure 1c
magnification is not same. It should be the same magnification to compare the morphology of
TiO2 and TiO2-CdS. CdS particles should be visualized from FESEM image.
3. Need EDX mapping of TiO2-CdS composite.
4. Need TEM images of TiO2 and TiO2-CdS composite to show the CdS real morphology and
interface.

This submission investigated the preparation and characterization of criss-crossed TiO2
nanoflakes combined with CdS (CNCC) for photo-reduction of CO2. The topic is interesting and
meanful, and the materials and methods were detailed, and the characterization of the CNCC
were well performed. Overall, most parts of the manuscript were presented satisfactorily. The
modified CNCC and its preparation methods are novel, and the data are reliable. I suggest this

manuscript be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science after revisions, and the
detailed comments are as follows.
On Abstract
1. Line 16 in Page 1: The authors should re-write this sentence.
On Introduction
2. Line 29 in Page 1: The authors should present the prospective audiences a better background
information on photocatalysis, the following two recent articles could serve this purpose in some
aspects: Microstructure and performance of Z-scheme photocatalyst of silver phosphate
modified by MWCNTs and Cr-doped SrTiO3 for malachite green degradation, Applied Catalysis
B: Environmental, 2018, 227: 557-570; Preparation of size-controlled silver phosphate catalysts
and their enhanced photocatalysis performance via synergetic effect with MWCNTs and PANI,
Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 2019, 245: 71-86.
On Results and Discussion
3. Line 24 in Page 2: On morphological characteristics and phase structures, the authors should
consider to discuss more in detail and compare data in this submission with those in other
literature including those mentioned above, for example, the first one mentioned above, and the
following ones: Insights into atrazine degradation by persulfate activation using composite of
nanoscale zero-valent iron and graphene: performances and mechanisms, Chemical Engineering
Journal, 2018, 341: 126-136; Performances and mechanisms of efficient degradation of atrazine
using peroxymonosulfate and ferrate as oxidants, Chemical Engineering Journal, 2018, 353: 533-
541.
4. Line 24 in Page 2: More other characteristics should be presented to support results of this
submission.
5. Line 41 in Page 2: It will be more interesting if the data for the effects of pH and coexistence of
inorganic salts were compared with those in the first article mentioned above.
6. On Figure 3 in Page 9: The color of the legend should be designed for the prospective
audiences to better read and understand.
7. Line 41 in Page 2: On transportation time and recombination time constants, the authors should
consider to cite literatures to support this conclusion.

Response to reviewers
We sincerely thank the reviewers for handling our manuscript and for
giving constructive comments. The manuscript has been thoroughly
revised according to the comments. The changes made in the revised
manuscript are highlighted in red colour.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
The paper is interesting. But author is provided the materials
information perfectly and introduction the articles is not significant to
highlight their work. So, the present form of the paper is not
publishable. After addressing below point successfully, the paper can
be considered for publication.
1. Introduction of the paper is not sufficient to highlight the novelty
of the work. As for example, TiO2-CdS composite photo reduction
works by other groups are completely hidden. SO, author should
describe this part in introduction to show the novelty of their
work.
Response: Thanks very much for your suggestion. The
introduction part has been re-organized to show the novelty of our
work.. TiO2-CdS composite photo reduction works by other
groups have been cited.
2. Need high resolution FESEM image of Figure 1c. Figure 1b
magnification and Figure 1c magnification is not same. It should
be the same magnification to compare the morphology of TiO2
and TiO2-CdS. CdS particles should be visualized from FESEM
image.
Response: We have replaced Figure 1c with high resolution
FESEM image. Figure 1b magnification and Figure 1c
magnification have changed same. CdS particles have been
visualized from FESEM image.
3. Need EDX mapping of TiO2-CdS composite.
Response: We have added EDX mapping of TiO2-CdS composite.
4. Need TEM images of TiO2 and TiO2-CdS composite to show the
CdS real morphology and interface.
Response: We have added TEM images of TiO2 and TiO2-CdS
composite.

2.Line 29 in Page 1: The authors should present the prospective

3.Line 24 in Page 2: On morphological characteristics and phase
structures, the authors should consider to discuss more in detail and

Response: We have added TEM images of TiO2 and TiO2-CdS
composite, EDX mapping of TiO2-CdS composite.
5.Line 41 in Page 2: It will be more interesting if the data for the
effects of pH and coexistence of inorganic salts were compared with
those in the first article mentioned above.
Response: The types of light sources, wavelength of light sources,
wattage of light sources, concentration of solution and gas flow
to the reactor used by researchers in photocatalytic reaction are
different. Even the photocatalyst loads precious metals has a
great influence on the catalytic effect. So this comparison is
difficult. However, some researchers compared synthetic
photocatalysts with commercial nano-titanium dioxide particles
in the same test system. So we compared the recombination time
of criss-crossed TiO2 nanoflakes with that of the typical TiO2
nanostructured films.
6.On Figure 3 in Page 9: The color of the legend should be designed
for the prospective audiences to better read and understand.
Response: On Figure 2 and Figure 3, the colors of the legend have
been designed to red and blue.
7.Line 41 in Page 2: On transportation time and recombination time
constants, the authors should consider to cite literatures to support this
conclusion.
Response: We have cited literatures to support the conclusion.
8.On Reusability: Data on Reusability should be provided.
Response: Data on reusability have been provided.
9.Line 56 in Page 3: On Conclusions, data on CO2 reduction should be

Response: On Conclusions, data on CO2 reduction have been
