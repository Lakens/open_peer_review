The research described in this paper - on an approach to generating 2D structures from an initial
1D line of tiles through cascading magnetic interactions - is interesting, novel and scientifically
sound. I believe it constitutes a solid contribution to the literature. The paper is well written, the
motivations are clear and the authors show a proper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the approach.
In my opinion the authors have more than adequately responded to the original reviewers'
comments.
As a biologically inspired approach to structure formation this is interesting and potentially
important work. The authors have produced a cleverly designed experimental framework that
has been used to demonstrate that the basic principles of their approach do indeed work.

The nomenclature used in this paper is not an easy one to follow for Biological Researchers. In
fact there are statements that might seem a bit off.
Take for example
"One example of biological self-assembly can be found in the assembly of DNA nucleotide bases
3
into the correct A-T and C-G pairs in a highly stochastic process, demonstrating a high level of
addressabilty."
I would argue that DNA replication is NOT a stochastic process (unless you consider any
chemical reaction a highly stochastic process).
A few other examples of this type of nomenclature clash exist and should be clarified.
Nomenclature should also be defined early on if biologists are to engage with the paper from the
beginning.
There are also some typos and the manuscript should be passed through a word corrector (e.g.
repariable should be repairable).
Finally, I would like to see some films of experiments with more than three tiles. It is stated that
you performed experiments with up to 10 tiles, so why not show some of these, with 5 or 6 tiles?

Editor Comments to Author:
Please accept our apologies for the unusual length of time that this transferred manuscript has
taken to complete review: we struggled to secure the advice of the more critical of the original
reviewers, but appreciate the support of the two reviewers who have provided commentary.
Broadly, your paper appears to be ready for acceptance, though one of the reviewers provides
feedback that we'd like you to address in your revised paper.

nk you both for your helpful comments, we are very grateful for your insight.
sponse to Reviewer 1
ppears that this reviewer is satisfied with the updates we have made to the work since our first
mission. We are thankful for their guidance in this respect.
sponse to Reviewer 2
re was some confusion with regards to the attached manuscript containing corrections from
viewer 2. After discussion with Alice Power it has been confirmed that the comments made in
manuscript should be ignored and any further corrections should be made based on the
gestions from the main body of the decision letter. The following updates have been made:
escribing the DNA replication as a stochastic process - we have removed the word ‘stochastic’
this context as we admit it is misleading. We have changed the sentence
ne example of biological self-assembly can be found in the assembly of DNA nucleotide bases
the correct A-T and C-G pairs in a highly stochastic process. “
ne example of biological self-assembly can be found in the assembly of DNA nucleotide bases
the correct A-T and C-G pairs in a thermally dynamic process involving massive sampling of
angements”.
e also recognise that Section 1.5 Anfinsen’s Thermodynamic Hypothesis is based on a
assical theory and there have since been several improvements and counter-examples to it
om biological research. We have made the following updates to our text to reflect this:
finsen showed that, with some exceptions, all of the information required for a protein amino
d sequence to fold is contained with the chain itself and that the globally stable (native) state of
equence must be located at the sequence's energetic minimum.”
been changed to
finsen was the first to hypothesise that all of the information required for a protein amino acid
uence to fold was contained with the chain itself and that the globally stable (native) state of a
uence must be located at the sequence's energetic minimum. ”
have also added the following sentence after the list of system requirements:
hile Anfinsen’s hypothesis is now widely considered to be a simplification of biological
cesses and that several counter-examples to his proposed system requirements exist, we
eve that his statements are a useful starting point for our approach in micro-robotics.”
here are also some typos and the manuscript should be passed through a word corrector (e.g.
pariable should be repairable) - This has been carried out.
inally, I would like to see some films of experiments with more than three tiles. It is stated that
ou performed experiments with up to 10 tiles, so why not show some of these, with 5 or 6 tiles?
There is a video of an experiment containing 7 tiles with the latest submission.
ain, the authors are very grateful for the time and thought that both reviewers have put into
essing our work and making it worthy of publication.
