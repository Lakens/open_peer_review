The authors conducted well done work on studying the catalytic activities of Ca2+ and K+ on
gasification of CO2 of Chinese lignite. I believe that this study could be applied to other types of
lignite. What the authors think about that? The work is well done using various physical methods
for characterization as FTIR for example. The work is recommended for publication.

In the present manuscript, Ban and co-workers present their investigation of the catalytic effect of
K and Ca for CO2 gasification of Shengli lignite. This topic is interesting, and might be helpful in
reduction of air pollution in many countries. The experimental methods were described in detail.
The results might be useful for people working in the related fields. The manuscript is framed
well. I’d like to suggest acceptance of the manuscript for publication in RSC advances after
improvements of the English.

In the Introduction section, Page 3, Line 63-66, the original
expressions:
“Recently, our investigations showed that the catalytic effects of
calcium were superior to that of potassium on gasification of Chinese
Shengli lignite.[29-30] In this work, it is devoted to the investigation
the interaction of the added K+ and Ca2+ with lignite, and the possible
mechanism for their different performance in catalyzing the
gasification reaction. It was found that the addition of K+ and Ca2+
could cause the structure changes of the lignite, resulting in the
increasing of the structural defects. The added Ca2+ interacted with the
carboxyl structure by both ionic forces and polycarboxylic
coordination, while K+ interacted with carboxyl structure mainly via
ionic forces. The different interaction mode may lead to the difference
in the activity energy during the catalytic gasification, i.e., the lower
activity energy of calcium than potassium, and thus calcium had
higher catalytic activity. Therefore, it was postulated that the changes
in lignite structure provided favorable conditions for the proceeding of
the gasification, and the different interaction mode of K+ and Ca2+ with
the carboxyl structure made Ca2+ have higher catalytic activity to the
gasification reaction.”
was revised into
“Recently, our previous studies showed that the catalytic effects of
calcium were superior to that of potassium on the gasification of
