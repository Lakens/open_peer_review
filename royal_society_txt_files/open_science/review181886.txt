It is an interesting study on exploring in ß-FeSe nanorods composited g-C3N4 with enhanced
photocatalytic efficicency. However, some results and discuss are imprecise so that I think a reject
is necessary for publication. The main questions and recommendation are listed as follows:
1. The simple combination of ß-FeSe and g-C3N4 lacks any novelty.
2. The results of XRD for 3wt% ß-FeSe/g-C3N4 composites, “The diffraction peak of
ß-FeSe in the composites is almost invisible because of its low content”, why not use a higher 5%
content? I don't know how the author came to the conclusion that the as- prepared samples is ß-
FeSe.
3. For XPS spectra of 3wt% ß-FeSe/g-C3N4 composites, why not provide Fe spectrograms?
4. What role does FeSe play in photocatalytic processes? The author has no reasonable
explanation.

General remarks
I have carefully read the manuscript, entitled “ß-FeSe nanorods composited g-C3N4 with
enhanced photocatalytic efficicency”. The article aims to enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-
C3N4 by coupling with the conducting ß-FeSe nanorods. The synthesized composite
photocatalyst was sufficiently characterized and its photocatalytic activity was assessed using
RhB as a model compound. Although the idea and organization of the work are good, the data
3
presentation is poor and several parts of the manuscript needs to be rewritten to be clear. This
paper might be considered for publication after extensive revision.
Specific observations
The title: Correct the word “efficicency” it should be “efficiency”.
Page 2 line 57: This paragraph should highlight the novelty of the present work. It also, may
include the aim of coupling ß-FeSe and g-C3N4.
Page 2 line 58: Please identify the RHB at the first incidence.
Page 2-3 lines 58- 10: The following sentences are repeated in the abstract and conclusions section.
“The photocatalytic rate of 3wt% ß-FeSe/g-C3N4 composites reaches 4.4 times than that of g-
C3N4. The improved photocatalytic properties could be ascribed to the reduced recombination of
photogenerated electrons and holes, which results from the excellent ability of ß-FeSe to capture
and transfer electrons. This work provides an alternative co-catalyst instead of noble metals for
photocatalysis”.
Page 3 line 14: The experimental section should include a material or chemicals subsection that
list all the chemicals used in the study.
Page 3 line 24: Give a brief description of the synthesis of ß-FeSe crystals.
Page 4 line 14: Since there is no mineralization test in this study, change the word “degrading” to
be decolorization in the whole manuscript.
Page 4 line 23: Delete the sentence “It should be stated that no permissions were required prior to
conducting the above research”.
Page 6 line 52: Fig. 4a should include the results of RhB photolysis. Also, authors should include
the results of the dark adsorption of RhB on g-C3N4, ß-FeSe and their composite in the
manuscript.
Page 6 line 53: The sentence “As shown in Fig. 4a, after exposure to visible light for 180 minutes,
the concentration of RhB was still 90% of the original” should be rewritten to clarify that this is
for g-C3N4.
Page 7 line 6: Change “ln (Co/C) = kt” to “the first-order reaction kinetics (ln (Co/C) = kt)”.
Page 7 line 42: What is the concentration (purity) of the H2O2.
Page 7 line 44: Scavenger for what? Also, what do the authors excluded the probability that H2O2
undergoes photolysis by UV light and generate free radicals as follows:
H_2 O_2 +h<U+03C5> <U+2192>2HO^•
Thus, H2O2 can serve as a reservoir of more active reactive oxygen species that would impact the
mechanism of photocatalysis.
Page 7 line 46: Fig. 5a should include the results of the 3wt% ß-FeSe/g-C3N4 without the H2O2.
Page 7 line 51: the authors state that “H2O2 can capture the photogenerated electrons to form OH
radicals, which are the main contributors to the photocatalytic process, thus further enhancing
photocatalytic activity”. another possibility for enhancing the photocataytic activity is the
photolysis of H2O2 by UV light can generate free radicals as stated above.

Page 9 line 14: Please recheck and rewrite the following sentences in clearer way “Moreover,
photogenerated holes cannot directly oxidize OH- to •OH for the valence band position of g-
C3N4 is more negative than 1.99 V of OH-/•OH. They directly capture the electrons of RhB.
Since the photogenerated electrons are entrapped by ß-FeSe nanorods, the transfer and
recombination of the electrons and holes are improved, which was confirmed by the EIS and PL
spectra. Thus, the photocatalytic efficiency is enhanced for ß-FeSe/g-C3N4 composites”.
Page 9 line 30: the conclusion section is repetition of the abstract, it should not be like that. Also,
the authors claim that the ß-FeSe is a low-cost co-catalyst, there is no proof for this assumption
in the manuscript keeping in mind that the synthesis of ß-FeSe is complex process.

Response to Reviewer 1:
1. The novelty of the present work has been reorganized and added in
the introduction part: “Considering that the recombination of
photogenerated carriers is the main reason for hindering the
photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4, the composition of
co-catalyst such as semiconductors and noble metal nanoparticles
can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and improve
the photocatalytic efficiency. FeSe does not contain precious metal
elements and is a potential electron capturer as mentioned above. It
is a fascinating question whether g-C3N4 composited with FeSe
nanorods has excellent photocatalytic activity. Here, we prepared a
series of ß-FeSe nanorods composited g-C3N4 and studied their
photocatalytic properties for decolorizing Rhodamine B (RhB).
The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is greatly improved after the
composition. This work provides a promising co-catalyst for
photocatalysis.”
2. A higher 10% content of ß-FeSe nanorods is composited with
g-C3N4 and characterized through XRD. The result is shown in Fig.
1b.
3. The Fe 2p spectrum has been added in the manuscript.
4. An explanation about the role of FeSe plays in photocatalytic
processes has been added in the manuscript. “FeSe acts as an
electron capturer and transferrer in photocatalytic processes, as
shown in Fig.7. Under visible light, electrons of g-C3N4 are excited,
which are rapidly transferred to ß-FeSe for its excellent ability to
capture electrons. Since the photogenerated electrons are entrapped
and transferred by ß-FeSe nanorods, the recombination of the
electrons and holes are improved, which was confirmed by the EIS
and PL spectra, in other words, the photogenerated electrons and
holes involved in the discoloration reaction of RhB are increased.
Thus the photocatalytic efficiency is enhanced for ß-FeSe/g-C3N4
composites.”
Response to Reviewer 2:
1. The word “efficicency” in the title has been corrected to be
“efficiency”.
2. (Page 2 line 57) In order to highlight the novelty of the present
work and with the aim of coupling ß-FeSe and g-C3N4, related
discussion has been reorganized and added in the introduction part.
“Considering that the recombination of photogenerated carriers is
the main reason for hindering the photocatalytic performance of
g-C3N4, the composition of co-catalyst such as semiconductors and
noble metal nanoparticles can promote the separation of
photogenerated carriers and improve the photocatalytic efficiency.
FeSe does not contain precious metal elements and is a potential
electron capturer as mentioned above. It is a fascinating question
whether g-C3N4 composited with FeSe nanorods has excellent
photocatalytic activity. Here, we prepared a series of ß-FeSe
nanorods composited g-C3N4 and studied their photocatalytic
properties for decolorizing Rhodamine B (RhB). The
photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is greatly improved after the
composition. This work provides a promising co-catalyst for
photocatalysis.”
3. (Page 2 line 58) RhB at the first incidence has been identified.
4. (Page 2-3 lines 58- 10) The repeated sentences have been revised.
5. (Page 3 line 14) All the chemicals used in the study are added in
the experimental section: “RhB (analytical grade), H2O2 (30 wt%,
analytical grade) and Na2SO4 (99%) were obtained from Innochem.
Urea (99.999%) and Nafion solution (5 wt%) was provided by
Aladdin. iron pieces (99.99%) and selenium shots (99.999%) were
purchased from Alfa Aesar.”
6. (Page 3 line 24) A brief description of the synthesis of ß-FeSe
crystals is given: “The iron pieces and selenium shots weighed in a
nominal ratio were sealed in a quartz tube, which was placed in a
muffle furnace at 750 °C, kept for 5 days and then heated to
1075 °C for 3 days. It was then quickly transferred to a muffle
furnace with 420 °C, kept for 2 days and then quenched in liquid
nitrogen.”
7. (Page 4 line 14) The word “degrading” is changed to be
“decolorizing” in the whole manuscript.
8. (Page 4 line 23) The sentence “It should be stated that no
permissions were required prior to conducting the above research”
is deleted.
9. (Page 6 line52) The results of RhB photolysis have been added in
Fig. 4b. The results of the dark adsorption of RhB on g-C3N4 and
their composite have been added in the manuscript (Fig. 4a).
10. (Page 6 line 53) The sentence “As shown in Fig. 4a, after exposure
to visible light for 180 minutes, the concentration of RhB was still
90% of the original” is rewritten to clarify that this is for g-C3N4.
11. (Page 7 line 6) “ln (Co/C) = kt” is changed to “the first-order
reaction kinetics (ln (Co/C) = kt)”.
12. (Page 7 line 42) The concentration of the H2O2 is 103 µL /100 mL.
The purity of the H2O2 is analytical grade. Related content has
been added to manuscript.
13. (Page 7 line 44) H2O2 served as a scavenger that could capture the
photoinduced electrons to form more ·OH radicals. The probability
that H2O2 undergoes photolysis by visible light and generate free
radicals is added: “On the one hand, H2O2 may undergo photolysis
by visible light and generate ·OH radicals.”
14. (Page 7 line 46) Fig. 5a is revised to include the results of the 3wt%
ß-FeSe/g-C3N4 without the H2O2.
15. (Page 7 line 51) Another possibility for enhancing the
photocataytic activity “the photolysis of H2O2 by visible light can
generate free radicals” is added.
16. (Page 9 line 14) The related sentences are rechecked and rewritten
to be “Moreover, photogenerated holes directly capture the
electrons of RhB and discolor it. Since the photogenerated
electrons are entrapped and transferred by ß-FeSe nanorods, the
recombination of the electrons and holes are improved, which was
confirmed by the EIS and PL spectra, in other words, the
photogenerated electrons and holes involved in the discoloration
reaction of RhB are increased. Thus the photocatalytic efficiency is
enhanced for ß-FeSe/g-C3N4 composites.”
17. (Page 9 line 30) The conclusion section has been revised to avoid
repetition of the abstract. The relevant wording “low-cost” has
been revised.
