The manuscript describes a potentially useful method to assess reserpine levels in serum based
on chromatographic separation and detection by fluorescence. The novelty of the method lies on
the way the fluorescence is induced - via electrochemical oxidation to 3,4-dehydroreserpine-
simpler compared to photochemical or chemical post derivatisation strategies reported so far.
Unfortunately, the manuscript is seriously flawed by bad English expression, inclusion of lots of
speculation without supporting information and lack of information on some critical aspects of
the new method.
Suggestions for improvement:
- Provide information on the levels of reserpine in serum that are relevant for clinical analysis. In
the Results and discussion section, discuss the analytical performances of the method not only in
the context of existing methods but also in relation to the levels of reserpine in clinical/biological
samples.
- Provide information and reference for electrochemical oxidation of reserpine to 3,4-
dehydroreserpine and justify why do you think detection by fluorescence is better than direct
electrochemical detection since even according to data in Table 1 direct electrochemical detection
leads to analytical performances that are similar to your method, see for example reference 12 in
Table 1. Move Table 1 in the main text and discuss in more detail the advantages of proposed
method compared to other reported procedures.
In addition to references 11 and 12, I would recommend to consider also some other works on

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors made a good effort to improve the quality of the manuscript and the English
expression is good now. However there are a series of flaws regarding the claimed method
validation, statistical analysis (figures with no error bars, number of calibration standards used to
assess linearity not given), data interpretation remains poor with some speculations not backed
up by evidence or literature citations. Several issued raised in reviewers comments were dealt
with only in the answers to reviewers comments, without being incorporated in the revised
manuscript as well.
Specific issues:
Weak data interpretation when discussing the effect of pH, applied potential and % acetonitrile
in the electrolyte: it remains unclear to a reader what is happening at the point where the peak
area of reserpine suddenly decreases, e.g at pH higher than 4, at potentials higher than 0.9 or at %
acetonitrile higher than 45%.
Section 2.3.2 specify the electrode material for the porous electrodes. Specify the resolution of the
power supply used to apply the potential.
Section 3.1. Please indicate in Figure 3 the luminescent groups as shown in the answer to
Reviewer comments
Section 3.4.1 “pH response first became negligibly negative”, please rephrase , do you mean
something like “ insignificant decrease in the reserpine peak area in the pH range 2-4”
What was the pH of the 5 mM H3PO4 solution chosen as optimum for the remaining of the work,
following the pH study in section 3.4.1?
What is the pKa of reserpine? Please consider it when discussing the influence of pH.
Section3.4.2 specify that by “potential” you mean the potential that is applied in the
electrochemical cell for the oxidation of reserpine
Section 3.4.2. You varied the potential in steps smaller than 0.5V, therefore please delete “by 0.5
V”. Please support your speculations about possible oxidation of the primary product with
8
literature references in the paragraph “ This behavior may have resulted…….primary product”.
Section 3.4.3 please rephrase “the ACN response became negative..” .
Section 3.4.3 What do you mean by “mixed standard”? Specify the levels of spiking and how are
these relevant compared to levels expected in the serum of mice
Section 3.4.3 what do you mean by “potential should be increased with ACN ratio”?
Section 3.5 Validation: how was the specificity test ( part of any validation procedure)conducted?
Please evaluate potential interferents/degradation products and metabolites in serum (e.g.
reserpic acid) in addition to reserpine to prove that they are not interfering with the assay.
Linearity: how many concentration levels were tested to assess linearity ?
Please include the chromatogram of reserpine at the detection limit, provided in the response to
reviewers, either in Figure 6 or in the Supplementary information and include a reference to this
figure in the manuscript when discussing the limit of detection.
I am concerned about the robustness of the method considering that the signal varies greatly
between applied potentials of 0.8 and 0.9 V or 0.9 to 1.0 V. The robustness of the method should
have been investigated , e.g varying the applied potential 0.89 to 0.91 V for example or 0.85 to
0.95 V according to the resolution of the power supply used in the experiments.
Please add the error bars in all Figures in manuscript and Supplementary info.
Section 3.5.1 by “limit of qualification” do you mean “limit of quantification”?
Section 3.5.3 Please include in the discussion of the performances of the proposed method
compared to existing ones the paragraph offered in the response to reviewers about the
advantages of fluorimetric detection compared to electrochemical one. Here you might also add
the paragraph about the advantages of your EC device compared to standard commercial gold
electrodes (most probably, the good analytical performance obtained is also related to the design
of your EC cell, not only to the other optimized operational parameters). Any answer offered as
response to reviewer comments should be found in the manuscript or supplementary material as
well.
Section 3.5.4 Please show the calibration curves obtained with standard reserpine solutions and
with reserpine solutions spiked in serum in the range 0.01-5 mg/L (what is called “external
standard curved” and “standard additions curve”, respectively).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The authors have improved the manuscript according to previous observations and suggestions.
However, some mistakes remain, the text can be condensed and reorganised for clarity, some
figures (e.g chromatograms related to the method selectivity) would be better moved in the main
text instead of Supplementary information. Selectivity study is not convincing, only includes
dopamine and L-dopa with different structure than reserpine.Is not clear from the information
presented if in serum reserpine will be present as unmetabolised compound or if there are
metabolites that might interfere. If metabolites and degradation products (reserpic acid, methyl
reserpate, trimethoxybenzoic acid) are not available commercially, other compounds of similar
structure should have been investigated. The results obtained with the drug-treated mouse serum
were not confirmed by a second analytical method. Therefore the conclusion that the method is
appropriate for reserpine analysis in serum is not entirely supported by the data.
Suggestions for improvement:
1. Abstract: please replace “The limit of qualification “ with “limit of quantitation”
2. Section 3.1 Electrochemical derivatisation of reserpine. This section gives the method principle
based on the electrochemical derivatization of reserpine, it should provide the excitation and
emission maxima and retention time for identification of reserpine and its oxidation product. In
the last paragraph: move the info from section 3.3 to section 3.1 and state what were the results
obtained (excitation and emission maxima, retention time), before inserting the reference to the
Supplementary info. Provide in the main manuscript the chromatograms for reserpine and its
electro-oxidised product, rather than having them in Supplementary info and comment the
chromatograms. Please specify why do you believe that the electro-oxidisation product is 3,4-
dehydroreserpine (i.e. based on excitation and emission maxima and based on the retention
time).
3. Section 3.2, Optimization. The authors have optimized the following 4 parameters: pH,
acetonitrile amount in the mobile phase, value of applied potential and temperature. These
should appear as subsections in section 3.2, Optimisation and the related graphs can be
condensed in a single figure a-d, if the authors desire. For each of the 4 parameters please specify
what was the best value obtained. Moreover, at the end of the optimization section, state the
conclusion on what are the best experimental conditions that were used further on: e.g the best
results in terms of short retention time and good peak shape were obtained for 5 mM H3PO4 and
45 % acetonitrile, at 25 C and for a value of the applied potential of 0.9 V. Please delete the
paragraph regarding the attempts by ion chromatography as is not clear what is the valuable
information obtained from these experiments. When discussing the optimization of the applied
voltage, support your claims of side reactions leading to weaker fluorescence with literature
citations, e.g. if it is known from literature that at higher potentials than 0.9 V 3,4,5,6-
tetradehydroreserpine is formed and if is known whether it has a different excitation/emission
spectra than 3,4, dehydroreserpine please mention it and cite the appropriate literature
references.
4. Section 3.3. Choice of detection wavelength. Since this was already reported in Section 3.1,
section 3.3 is redundant and should be eliminated, with the info moved to section 3.1.
5. Section 3.5.3 Comparison with other methods: the paragraph detailing the characteristics of the
13
porous Ti electrode and why the authors believe that their method is better than others should be
inserted after the Table comparing your method with others. First, refer to results in Table 2,
comment on the advantages of the presented approach compared to other methods and
afterwards explain why you think that your method is good, something like: we attribute the
good characteristics of our method to …and add your explanation. Please rephrase “Table S1
shows that the usual range of serum drug level (as discussed in Section 1) is within the linearity
of the proposed method”, it should be written the other way around, i.e. the method is
appropriate for detection in serum considering the linear range of the method and the typical
levels of reserpine in serum.
6. When comparing with other methods, refer not only to the HPLC/MS detection but also to
direct and simple application of electrochemical methods. For example, what is the advantage of
your method compared with reference 12 (adsorptive stripping voltammetry), since the range
and detection limits are similar? Your method includes also a chromatographic separation;
therefore it should be inherently more selective.
7. Section 3.5.3, end : the assertion “Thus, our present approach is a sensitive and reliable
technique that is suitable for the analysis of reserpine in biological samples” placed at the end of
section 3.5.3 is not justified. The authors might state, that, considering the appropriate linear
range and good analytical performances of the proposed method compared to other literature-
proposed approaches, they investigated further the applicability of their method for analysis in
serum.
8. Section 3.5.4. Analysis of reserpine in mouse serum samples, please delete “We detected
reserpine in mouse serum under the same experimental conditions as Section 3.5.1.”, is repeating
a similar phrase from just 2 sentences above.
9. Section 3.1 second paragraph, page 13, There seems to be something missing from the phrase
“Reserpine contains available nitrogen with an unshared pair of electrons, a wo electron
oxidation occurs with formation of an N-oxide [30]. “
10. Section 3.5.4 Please correct the phrase “For comparison, we tested blank and drug-treated
mouse serum were tested.” (delete “were tested”). Since serum from drug-treated mouse was
tested, the information about how much reserpine was given to the mouse should be provided.
Any information known from literature about how reserpine is found in rat serum- whether is
the intact compound or is metabolized should be mentioned, so the reader will know what is
actually measured. The concentration measured in the serum of drug-treated mouse should have
been confirmed by analysis with a second method to confirm that the method is accurate, in
addition with recovery calculations of reserpine in spiked samples.
11. Selectivity: would it be possible that some metabolites with similar structure as reserpine co-
elute with reserpine? How did you establish the identity of the peak attributed to reserpine in the
drug-treated mouse serum? Could you confirm it by HPLC/MS or a parallel method? For
example, would it be possible by coupling a DAD detector instead of FLD and do a peak purity
test to check that the peak attributed to reserpine is pure reserpine? If reserpine is co-eluting with
other compounds with similar structure, how would you know what you measure exactly?
12. Please specify that the method selectivity was evaluated by analyzing samples of potential
interfering compounds (L-dopa and dopamine) and mention the concentration levels at which
these potential interfering compounds were tested. If none of the known metabolites and
degradation products of reserpine are commercially, other alkaloids with similar structure as
reserpine might be available and should have been included in the selectivity study.
13. In Table 2 the methods are mixed with the detectors, for example, what is a “CV” detector in
reference, where the method is stripping voltammetry? Please check and correct the Table.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have improved the manuscript according to previous observations and suggestions.
However, some mistakes remain, the text can be condensed and reorganised for clarity, some
figures (e.g chromatograms related to the method selectivity) would be better moved in the main
text instead of Supplementary information. Selectivity study is not convincing, only includes
dopamine and L-dopa with different structure than reserpine.Is not clear from the information
presented if in serum reserpine will be present as unmetabolised compound or if there are
metabolites that might interfere. If metabolites and degradation products (reserpic acid, methyl
reserpate, trimethoxybenzoic acid) are not available commercially, other compounds of similar
structure should have been investigated. The results obtained with the drug-treated mouse serum
were not confirmed by a second analytical method. Therefore the conclusion that the method is
appropriate for reserpine analysis in serum is not entirely supported by the data.
Suggestions for improvement:
1. Abstract: please replace “The limit of qualification “ with “limit of quantitation”
2. Section 3.1 Electrochemical derivatisation of reserpine. This section gives the method principle
based on the electrochemical derivatization of reserpine, it should provide the excitation and
emission maxima and retention time for identification of reserpine and its oxidation product. In
the last paragraph: move the info from section 3.3 to section 3.1 and state what were the results
obtained (excitation and emission maxima, retention time), before inserting the reference to the
Supplementary info. Provide in the main manuscript the chromatograms for reserpine and its
electro-oxidised product, rather than having them in Supplementary info and comment the
chromatograms. Please specify why do you believe that the electro-oxidisation product is 3,4-
dehydroreserpine (i.e. based on excitation and emission maxima and based on the retention
time).
3. Section 3.2, Optimization. The authors have optimized the following 4 parameters: pH,
acetonitrile amount in the mobile phase, value of applied potential and temperature. These
should appear as subsections in section 3.2, Optimisation and the related graphs can be
condensed in a single figure a-d, if the authors desire. For each of the 4 parameters please specify
what was the best value obtained. Moreover, at the end of the optimization section, state the
conclusion on what are the best experimental conditions that were used further on: e.g the best
results in terms of short retention time and good peak shape were obtained for 5 mM H3PO4 and
45 % acetonitrile, at 25 C and for a value of the applied potential of 0.9 V. Please delete the
paragraph regarding the attempts by ion chromatography as is not clear what is the valuable
information obtained from these experiments. When discussing the optimization of the applied
voltage, support your claims of side reactions leading to weaker fluorescence with literature

Appendix B
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
We sincerely thank you for your consideration and the reviewers’
insightful comments on our manuscript entitled “Fluorimetric detection
of reserpine in mouse serum by on-line post-column electrochemical
derivatisation” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-171356). The reviewers’
comments have been highly valuable and helpful for the revision and
improvement of our work. We have studied all comments carefully and
tried our best to address the reviewers’ concerns and suggestions. Our
main corrections and responses to the reviewers’ comments are given
below.
Reviewer 1:
General comments:
The manuscript should be reviewed or edited by the person who is
well-versed in writing scientific English language or by a native
English speaker.
Specific comments:
1. Page 2; line 36-42: Authors mentioned “we adapted HPLC
system combined with post-column
electrochemical…..detection of reserpine” While in page 4; line
16–20 authors are writing “we attempted to use ion exchange
chromatography (IC) system with citation exchange column”: I
would ask authors to make it sure on this and do the needful
accordingly.
Response: We apologise for our unclear phrasing. Ion chromatography
(IC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are efficient
separation and quantification methods. At the initial stage of our
experiment, we attempted to use the IC system given its applicability
over a wide pH range of application and its high selectivity. Our results,
however, were unsatisfactory. Thus, we selected the HPLC method
given its feasibility. In the revised manuscript, we provide a discussion
of the reasons for our poor IC results and for our decision to use the
HPLC method.
2. In method section, authors should provide information for the
derivatization steps following proper citation of the reference.
Response: Thank you for excellent advice. We have learned greatly
from the following relevant works:

Vibrational Predissociation Spectroscopy with a Mass
Spectrometric Interface to an Electrochemical Cell[J]. Anal. Chem,

the Indole Alkaloid Reserpine Using a Glassy Carbon Based

1477;
The derivatisation scheme is provided below:
Reserpine dehydrogenation extensively reported, and its
mechanism has been clarified. We apologise for neglecting this point in
our initial manuscript. We restructured sections of the Discussion and
added relevant references to the revised manuscript.
3. The methodology of the research is not well explained.
Response: We apologise for the weak and vague language of our
previous manuscript. To clarify, we proposed a sensitive and selective
approach that combines chromatographic separation and post-column
derivatisation for reserpine detection. To improve the clarity of our
manuscript, we have separately discussed the mechanism of
electrochemical derivatisation (Section 3.1) from that of
chromatography and rewritten the Discussion section. In addition, we
provided a comprehensive discussion of parameter optimisation.
4. Is there any major effect of pH on the fluorescence signal data?
If possible insert the data figure?
Response: Absolutely. pH changes the fluorescence signal. We are
grateful for your comment. It has helped us complete our work. At first,
we only considered that an acidic environment contributes to
derivatisation and improves peak shape. Thus, we only investigated the
effects of 1–5 mM H3PO4. To clarify the effects of pH, we used
phosphate buffer with the pH range of 2–6. Given the pH range for the
application of the C18 column, we ignored pH values below 2. The
figure provided below shows the effects of pH on fluorescence signal.
pH response became intense in the pH range of 2–4 and decreased when
pH exceeded 4. We have inserted the below figure in the revised
manuscript. We selected 5 mM H3PO4 (pH = 2.6) in consideration of
feasibility and easy operation.
5. Did authors try any internal standard also, as they have
mentioned the use of external standard sample (Page 6; Line 20).
Response: We used an appropriate internal standard when a pure
standard was difficult to obtain. However, the reserpine standard (=99%
purity) was easily obtained. An appropriate internal standard must
satisfy the following requirements: similar properties as the target
analyte, complete separation with the target analyte, no reaction and
similar retention time as the target analyte. In our work, we used the
external standard method not only in solution but also in real mouse
serum sample to avoid external influences. Moreover, thank you for this
suggestion. It has inspired us to consider applying this method in our
following work.
6. Overall discussion in whole the manuscript is very weak. There
is no comparative discussion regarding LOD, linear range and
others?
Response: Thank you for your reminders. We originally discussed the
comparative information (e.g. detection limit) after analytical
application and provided the summary table in the Supporting
Information section. We reorganised the Discussion section and
provided additional evidence in the revised manuscript. We have moved
the summary table to the main text. We also compared the proposed
method with previously reported methods (see Section 3.5.3).
7. Page 3; Line 30:- Delete “Home-made”.
Provide the full form of “PTFE”.
Caption of Figure 5; make clear about “drug given sample” or
use another terminology such as “drug given mice serum samples”
or so on
Response: Thank you for the good advice. We revised our English
expression and ensured that language issues have been solved.
Special thanks for your valuable comments.
Reviewer: 2
The manuscript describes a potentially useful method to assess
reserpine levels in serum based on chromatographic separation and
detection by fluorescence. The novelty of the method lies on the way
the fluorescence is induced via electrochemical oxidation to 3,4-
dehydroreserpine— simpler compared to photochemical or
chemical post derivatisation strategies reported so far.
Unfortunately, the manuscript is seriously flawed by bad English
expression, inclusion of lots of speculation without supporting
information and lack of information on some critical aspects of the
new method.
Suggestions for improvement:
1. Provide information on the levels of reserpine in serum that are
relevant for clinical analysis. In the Results and discussion
section, discuss the analytical performances of the method not
only in the context of existing methods but also in relation to the
levels of reserpine in clinical/biological samples.
Response: Thank you for your reminders. In our previous manuscript,
we only focused on the advantages of the proposed method compared
with those of other existing methods to highlight its novelty, and we
neglected to validate its application with real samples. The relevant
doses of reserpine in animals and humans, including clinical dosage and
teratogenic dosage, are discussed in the Introduction and Discussion
sections of the revised edition.
2. Provide information and reference for electrochemical
oxidation of reserpine to 3,4-dehydroreserpine and justify why
do you think detection by fluorescence is better than direct
electrochemical detection since even according to data in Table
1 direct electrochemical detection leads to analytical
performances that are similar to your method, see for example
reference 12 in Table 1. Move Table 1 in the main text and
discuss in more detail the advantages of proposed method
compared to other reported procedures.In addition to
references 11 and 12, I would recommend to consider also some
other works on electrochemical oxidation of reserpine: 1. Van
Berkel and Kertesz, Expanded Electrochemical Capabilities of

reserpine, Journal of Pharmaceutical & Biomedical Analysis,
Vol. 7, No. 6, pp. 709-713,1989;
3. Please provide evidence or reference that electrochemical
oxidation of reserpine in acid/acetonitrile mixtures in the
conditions used leads to 3,4–dehydroreserpine. The cited
references in the manuscript refer only to the chemical or
photochemical oxidation.
Response: We sincerely thank you for your excellent comments and
suggestions. In addition to the above works, we have included the
following relevant works:
1. Fournier J A, Wolk A B, Johnson M A. Integration of Cryogenic Ion
Vibrational Predissociation Spectroscopy with a Mass
Spectrometric Interface to an Electrochemical Cell[J]. Analytical
chemistry, 2013, 85(15): 7339–7344.

electrospray ion source using a porous flow-through electrode
emitter." Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry
15.12 (2004): 1755–1766.
I would like to respond to comments 2 and 3 together.
The derivatisation scheme is presented below:
Reserpine dehydrogenation has been extensively reported, and its
mechanism has been clarified. We apologise for neglecting this point in
our initial manuscript. We have discussed this point in the Discussion
section and cited relevant references in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the
revised manuscript.
Fluorescence detection and direct electrochemical detection are
highly sensitive. These two approaches have similar detection limits and
linearities, as illustrated in Table 1 (reference 12). However, the
selectivity of cyclic voltammetry is slightly inferior to that of
fluorescence detection when used to detect analytes in a complex matrix,
such as serum. Furthermore, the direct electrochemical detection of
reserpine is conducted offline and does not integrate chromatographic
separation. Thus, the reserpine detection efficiency of direct
electrochemical detection methods may be influenced by the complex
matrix and other interferents. Most importantly, the electrode area of
ECD is smaller than that of the electrolytic cell we proposed. The small
electrode area of ECD lowers electro-oxidised efficiency.
Again, thank you for your advice. We have moved Table 1 to the
main text and provided an in-depth discussion in Section 3.5.3.
4. Page 3, section 2.3.2 Fabrication of the home-made electrolytic
cell device: specify the type (material and suppliers) for the
porous electrodes and cation exchange membrane. If you have
previously used this cell for other applications and you have
described the cell in more detail there, refer to that respective
work. Justify the choice of this electrolytic cell. Is it similar to
commercial ECDs for HPLC, will the method be readily applied
using commercially available electrochemical cells?
Response: We have specified the types of porous electrodes and cation-
exchange membranes that we used in the main text.
We apologise for our confusing and vague introduction to device
fabrication. The term “commercial ECDs” refers to electrochemical
detectors, whereas the term “ECD” in the former manuscript refers to
the electrolytic cell device for derivatisation. In the new manuscript, we
have renamed our proposed approach as ”HPLC/EC/FLD” to avoid
confusion.
Furthermore, the large electrode area and electrode materials of the
electrolytic cell device are different from those of commercial ECDs.
Gold electrodes with small areas are usually applied in commercial
ECDs. Complete electro-oxidisation is difficult to achieve with such a
small area. Thus, commercial ECDs have low oxidation efficiency and
will not provide good accuracy and precision if applied in the proposed
method. In addition, increasing the area of gold electrodes will increase
production costs. By contrast, porous materials are cheap and need
minimal consideration.
5. Provide the chromatogram and data on the limit of quantitation.
What is the method precision? Was the temperature controlled
in the method, what was the temperature?
Response: The chromatogram on the limit of quantitation is shown
below (based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, S/N = 10).
.
The precision of the proposed method was examined using three
duplicate samples. As shown in Table 1, the RSDs of peak areas were
less than 2% for the analyses of a mixed standard solution containing 2
mg/L reserpine. For matrix-matched analysis, RSDs were less than
6.4%.
Thank you for pointing out the parameter of temperature. We have
studied its influence on the proposed method, and the results are shown
in the left figure below.
Fluorescence signal intensified when environmental temperature
increased. The increase in temperature decreased solution viscosity,
consequently increasing the frequency of molecular motion. However,
high temperatures aggravated molecular diffusion, which caused strong
peak tailing that complicated quantification, as shown by the right-hand
panel of the above figure.
We selected 25 °C for optimisation.
6. The pH was studied in the range 2.2–3. However, many of the
works on reserpine electrochemical oxidation use pH around 5–
6 (e.g Stankovic et al. Int. J. Electrochem. Sci., 10 (2015) 1469–
1477), some mention the increase in oxidation current due to
formation of 34-dehydroreserpine with the higher pH. Please
compare with oxidation at pH up to 6, not only up to 3.
Response: Absolutely, pH changes the fluorescence signal. We are
grateful for your comment. It has helped us complete our work. At first,
we only considered that an acidic environment contributes to
derivatisation and improves peak shape. Thus, we only investigated the
effects of 1–5 mM H3PO4. To clarify the effects of pH, we used
phosphate buffer with the pH range of 2–6. Given the pH range for the
application of the C18 column, we ignored pH values below 2. The
figure provided below shows the effects of pH on fluorescence signal.
pH response became intense in the pH range of 2–4 and decreased when
pH exceeded 4. We have inserted the below figure in the revised
manuscript. We selected 5 mM H3PO4 (pH = 2.6) in consideration of
feasibility and easy operation.
7. With regards to the choice of experimental conditions, in
particular the mobile phase for separation and for oxidation of
reserpine, the conditions chosen in the manuscript are similar to
others, except for the pH. See for example the mobile phase in
the USP method for Reserpine and a 2005 report by Van Berkel
and Kertesz, Anal. Chem. 2005, 77, 8041-8049 on ESI for
analysis and electrochemical oxidation of reserpine. Instead of
the story and speculations at page 4, section 3.1, please provide
actual data for the optimisation study, see also the previous
comment.
Response: We thank you for recommending relevant references. In
general, an aqueous solution with an organic modifier, usually methanol
or acetonitrile, is used as the mobile phase in the HPLC method. Buffer
solutions or other aqueous solutions, such NH4Cl as in the USP method,
suppress analyte dissociation, thus perfecting the peak. Organic
modifiers usually work as eluents in connection with retention time. We
previously selected methanol and acetonitrile as organic modifiers
under normal conditions. We provide a discussion of our reasons for
selecting these compounds in Sections 3.2 and 3.4. Our proposed
method is different from other methods in that the mobile phase serves
as the supporting electrolyte in post-column electrochemical
derivatisation. Thus, derivatisation efficiency, not only retention effect,
needs to be considered. In the reported work, the medium is composed
of acetic acid, phosphate buffer and acetic acid. No previous work has
shown that 3,4-dehydroreserpine can be obtained from the
electrochemical oxidation of reserpine in acid/ACN mixtures under the
conditions used in our work. However, our present work proves
otherwise (Figs. S2 and S3).
Thank you for your advice for regarding our discussion of parameter
optimisation. We have added a discussion of parameter optimisation to
the main text and Supplementary Information of the revised manuscript
to complete and strengthen our work.
8. Page 5, section 3.3, lines 36-39 what luminescent groups are you
referring to?
Response: Reserpine is converted to a p-electron-rich compound when
electro-oxidised through the irreversible electron-transfer reaction. Its
long-conjugate structure and free radicals strengthen fluorescence
signals. We show the luminescent groups in the figure below (the region
marked green).
9. Supplementary material: add caption for Figure S3 and explain
abbreviations in Table 1.
10. Please improve English expression. In the introduction
particularly is very difficult to understand the meaning of many
phrases. Some examples .
Page 1, line 40-49: please reformulate “The use of
reserpine….sides” as is not clear what you meant. Please don’t
start phrases with “while”. Please reformulate: ”To make
certain sense….clinical analysis”, is not clear what you meant.
Page 2, line 1: Please delete “identically”, it makes no sense
Etc.
Response: We apologise for the problematic language of our original
manuscript. Thank you for your kind suggestion. We have carefully
revised and checked the whole manuscript to resolve language issues.
Again, thank you for your valuable comments.

Appendix E
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
We sincerely thank you for your consideration and the reviewers’
insightful comments on our manuscript entitled “Fluorimetric detection
of reserpine in mouse serum by on-line post-column electrochemical
derivatisation” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-171948). The reviewers’
comments have been highly valuable and helpful for the revision and
improvement of our work. We have studied all comments carefully and
exert our best efforts to address their concerns and suggestions. Our
main corrections and responses to the reviewers’ comments are
presented as follows.
Reviewer 2:
The authors made a good effort to improve the quality of the
manuscript and the English expression is good now. However there
are a series of flaws regarding the claimed method validation,
statistical analysis (figures with no error bars, number of
calibration standards used to assess linearity not given), data
interpretation remains poor with some speculations not backed up
by evidence or literature citations. Several issued raised in
reviewers comments were dealt with only in the answers to
reviewers comments, without being incorporated in the revised
manuscript as well.
Specific issues:
Weak data interpretation when discussing the effect of pH, applied
potential and % acetonitrile in the electrolyte: it remains unclear to
a reader what is happening at the point where the peak area of
reserpine suddenly decreases, e.g at pH higher than 4, at potentials
higher than 0.9 or at % acetonitrile higher than 45%.
Response: We sincerely thank you for your insightful comments on our
work. The three most important parts need to be revised, namely, weak
data interpretation of pH, and potential and % acetonitrile were
discussed in detail. We supported our discussion with relevant
references or literatures in the revised manuscript.
Section 2.3.2 specify the electrode material for the porous electrodes.
Specify the resolution of the power supply used to apply the
potential.
Response: The porous electrode was designed using Ti. The resolution
of the power supply is 0.1 V.
Section 3.1. Please indicate in Figure 3 the luminescent groups as
shown in the answer to Reviewer comments
Response: We indicated the luminescent groups (regions marked in
green) in Figure 3.
Section 3.4.1 “pH response first became negligibly negative”, please
rephrase, do you mean something like “insignificant decrease in the
reserpine peak area in the pH range 2-4”
What was the pH of the 5 mM H3PO4 solution chosen as optimum
for the remaining of the work, following the pH study in section
3.4.1?
What is the pKa of reserpine? Please consider it when discussing
the influence of pH.
Response : Thank you for identifying the flaws in the previous
manuscript. Relevant revisions were performed in the revised edition.
1. Section 3.4.1 We apologise for our vague expression. As you
mentioned, we rephrase the expression as follows: “Peak area (height)
decreased insignificantly within pH 2-4. A drastic decrease in the signal
was found, when pH exceeded 4.”
2. The pH of the 5 mM H3PO4 solution is 2.6. Reserpine dissociated
completely and the electrochemical oxidation remained almost
unchanged in the pH range of 2–4 and with the same ratio of ACN.
Therefore, 5 mM H3PO4 (pH = 2.6) was selected in consideration of
feasibility and easy operation.
3. The dissociation constant (pKa) of reserpine is 66 (at 25 <U+2103>) [35].
We sincerely thank you for reminding us of this analyte property. This
property is important to explain the dramatic decrease in pH response,
as shown in Fig. 4. Calculations revealed that only at pH < 4.6 can
reserpine dissociate completely. This result was consistent with the pH
dependence found in the present work, where the slopes changed
abruptly between pH 4 to 5. Incomplete dissociation of reserpine
resulted in drastic decrease in fluorescence signal at pH > 4.6 (Fig. 4).
Stankovic[33] reported that protons participated in the electro-
oxidisation of reserpine, in agreement with the pH response that
insignificantly decreased within 2-4. We have revised this section in the
final manuscript.
Section 3.4.2. You varied the potential in steps smaller than 0.5V,
therefore please delete “by 0.5 V”. Please support your speculations
about possible oxidation of the primary product with literature
references in the paragraph “ This behavior may have
resulted…….primary product”.
Response: We specified ‘potential of the EC’ to enable the readers to
understand.
We also deleted ’by 0.5 V’.
As shown in Fig. 3, we support the electro-oxidisation mechanism of
reserpine, which has been demonstrated by many studies [27-29]. Here,
the primary product is 3,4-dehydroreserpine. When the potential of the
EC exceeded 0.9 V, it was more likely to generate 3,4,5,6-
tetradehydroreserpine. However, other side effects also might occur
when the potential exceed 0.9 V, such as blocked mass transfer and
water electrolysis. For more specific accuracy of expression, we
rephrased the expression as follows: ’This phenomenon might be
attributed to some further side effects, and the products might yield
weaker fluorescence intensity than that of 0.9 V.’
Section 3.4.3 please rephrase “the ACN response became negative.”.
Response: We rephrased the expression as follows: ’the fluorescence
signal decreased when ACN ratio increased to 50%.’
Section 3.4.3 What do you mean by “mixed standard”? Specify the
levels of spiking and how are these relevant compared to levels
expected in the serum of mice
Response: We apologise for the inaccurate presentation. We rephrased
it in Section 3.5.2 as follows: ’The RSDs of peak areas were less than
2% for the analysis of a standard solution that contains 2 mg/L of
reserpine. For matrix-matched analysis, the RSDs were less than 6.4%,
as shown in Table 1.
Section 3.4.3 what do you mean by “potential should be increased
with ACN ratio”?
Response: We rephrased it as follows: ’potential should be increased
when the ACN ratio is increased’
Section 3.5 Validation: how was the specificity test (part of any
validation procedure) conducted? Please evaluate potential
interferents/degradation products and metabolites in serum (e.g.
reserpic acid) in addition to reserpine to prove that they are not
interfering with the assay.
Linearity: how many concentration levels were tested to assess
linearity?
Please include the chromatogram of reserpine at the detection limit,
provided in the response to reviewers, either in Figure 6 or in the
Supplementary information and include a reference to this figure in
the manuscript when discussing the limit of detection.
Response:
1. The method was validated in terms of linearity, limit of detection,
limit of quantification, precision and accuracy. Matrix effect in mouse
serum was evaluated by comparing the calibration curve slopes in pure
solvent (external calibration curves) with that in pre-treated sample
spiked standard (matrix-matched calibration curves). We discussed the
validation procedure in Section 3.5.
2. Seven-point calibration curves were prepared in triplicate in the
range of 0.01-5.0 mg/L. The appropriate revision was performed in
Section 2.2. LOD and LOQ values were estimated as the concentrations
that correspond to signal-to-noise ratios of 3 and 10, respectively, by
means of spiked samples at low concentration levels. We investigated
the accuracy of the proposed method using samples spiked with
precisely weighed amounts of reserpine and examined the precision of
the proposed method by using three duplicate samples including
solution samples and matrix-matched samples.
3. We are sorry that, to date, no such suppliers (e.g. Aladdin, Sigma)
in China support the standard of the degradation products and
metabolites that you suggested (e.g. reserpic acid). However, the
potential interferents (e.g. dopamine, ascorbic acid, uric acid, ajmalicine,
and yohimbine) did not interfere in the detection of the target analyte
[33]. And we investigated about it. The effect of dopamine and L-dopa
was studied by adding it into reserpine by using the manifold shown in
Fig. S1. As shown in Fig. S10, the fluorescence signal remained
unchanged. Actually, the degradation and metabolites were different
from other interferents. They were derived from reserpine itself. The
degree of metabolic and its influence (if any) were almost same,
according to the structure analysis. The result will be confirmed when
we obtain access to the standard in the future. We revised and
replenished the discussion in Section 3.5.4.

(C) dopamine, (D) L-dopa.
4. Thank you for suggesting that the chromatogram should be
included in our text. We have added it into the Supporting Information
file (Fig.S9) and a reference was included.
I am concerned about the robustness of the method considering that
the signal varies greatly between applied potentials of 0.8 and 0.9 V
or 0.9 to 1.0 V. The robustness of the method should have been
investigated , e.g varying the applied potential 0.89 to 0.91 V for
example or 0.85 to 0.95 V according to the resolution of the power
supply used in the experiments.
Response:We are also concerned about the robustness of the method.
The highest resolution of the power supply used in the experiments is
0.1 V. At first, we varied the potential by 0.5 V for primary test, and the
maxima was at 1.0 V. Then, we focused on the range nearby 1.0 V. Thus,
we varied the potential by 0.1 V between 0.5 V to 1.5 V and found that
the maximal signal was at 0.9 V. More studies that vary the applied
potential should be conducted to obtain precise results. We will provide
accurate results when a suitable instrument has been assembled in our
lab. In addition, we replenished the information of the supplier
resolution in Section 2.3.2.
Please add the error bars in all Figures in manuscript and
Supplementary info.
Response: We have added the error bars in all Figures.
Section 3.5.1 by “limit of qualification” do you mean “limit of
quantification”?
Response: We rephrased the expression in Section 3.5.1.
Section 3.5.3 Please include in the discussion of the performances of
the proposed method compared to existing ones the paragraph
offered in the response to reviewers about the advantages of
fluorimetric detection compared to electrochemical one. Here you
might also add the paragraph about the advantages of your EC
device compared to standard commercial gold electrodes (most
probably, the good analytical performance obtained is also related
to the design of your EC cell, not only to the other optimized
operational parameters). Any answer offered as response to
reviewer comments should be found in the manuscript or
supplementary material as well.
Response: We sincerely thank you for your affirmation and
encouragement. We added the paragraph on the advantages of the EC
device as you suggested for a much substantial manuscript in Section
3.5.3. We checked through the manuscript, and the previous response to
the reviewer to ensure that the answers can be found in the manuscript
and supplementary materials. Thank you very much for your reminder.
Section 3.5.4 Please show the calibration curves obtained with
standard reserpine solutions and with reserpine solutions spiked in
serum in the range 0.01-5 mg/L (what is called “external standard
curved” and “standard additions curve”, respectively).
Response: We plotted the calibration curves in Fig. S9 and added it into
the supporting information material file.
Figure 1 Replace “Separate column” by “separation column”
Figure 3 and throughout the manuscript, replace “electro-
oxidisation” by “electro-oxidation”
Response: We revised these mistakes.
Special thanks for your valuable comments and encouragement.

Appendix G
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
We sincerely thank you for your consideration and the
reviewers’ insightful comments on our manuscript entitled
“Fluorimetric detection of reserpine in mouse serum by on-
line post-column electrochemical derivatisation”
(Manuscript ID: RSOS-171948.R2). The reviewers’
comments have been highly valuable and helpful for the
revision and improvement of our work. We have studied all
comments carefully and exert our best efforts to address
their concerns and suggestions. Our main corrections and
responses to the reviewers’ comments are presented as
follows.
Reviewer: 2
The authors have improved the manuscript according to previous
observations and suggestions. However, some mistakes remain, the
text can be condensed and reorganised for clarity, some figures
(e.g chromatograms related to the method selectivity) would be
better moved in the main text instead of Supplementary
information. Selectivity study is not convincing, only includes
dopamine and L-dopa with different structure than reserpine. Is
not clear from the information presented if in serum reserpine will
be present as unmetabolised compound or if there are metabolites
that might interfere. If metabolites and degradation products
(reserpic acid, methyl reserpate, trimethoxybenzoic acid) are not
available commercially, other compounds of similar structure
should have been investigated. The results obtained with the drug-
treated mouse serum were not confirmed by a second analytical
method. Therefore the conclusion that the method is appropriate
for reserpine analysis in serum is not entirely supported by the
data.
Suggestions for improvement:
1. Abstract: please replace “The limit of qualification “ with “limit
of quantitation”
Response: Thank you and we rephrased it.
2. Section 3.1 Electrochemical derivatisation of reserpine. This
section gives the method principle based on the electrochemical
derivatization of reserpine, it should provide the excitation and
emission maxima and retention time for identification of reserpine
and its oxidation product. In the last paragraph: move the info
from section 3.3 to section 3.1 and state what were the results
obtained (excitation and emission maxima, retention time), before
inserting the reference to the Supplementary info.
Provide in the main manuscript the chromatograms for reserpine
and its electro-oxidised product, rather than having them in
Supplementary info and comment the chromatograms.
Please specify why do you believe that the electro-oxidisation
product is 3,4-dehydroreserpine (i.e. based on excitation and
emission maxima and based on the retention time).
Response: We apologise for the vague expression of our previous
manuscript. To clarify, we condensed and reorganized it. The info in
section 3.3 before was moved to section 3.1. The excitation and
emission maxima of the electro-oxidized product were consistent with
literatures reported [14-16], which were shown on Fig. 4. The
retention time of the reserpine and its electro-oxidised product were
same because the analyte was separated first and then derived.
Thank you for your advice. We moved the chromatograms to the
main manuscript. To specify our conclusion, we rephrased our
expression in section 3.1. (i.e. The maximal excitation and emission
wavelengths of reserpine were 231 nm (overtone) and 263/339 nm,
respectively, and the emission wavelength of the electro-oxidised
product was 385/495 nm. Based on excitation and emission maxima
which were consistent with previous works, our results suggested that
the product is 3,4-dehydroreserpine [14-16].)
3. Section 3.2, Optimization. The authors have optimized the
following 4 parameters: pH, acetonitrile amount in the mobile
phase, value of applied potential and temperature.
These should appear as subsections in section 3.2,
Optimisation and the related graphs can be condensed in a single
figure a-d, if the authors desire.
For each of the 4 parameters please specify what was the best
value obtained.
Moreover, at the end of the optimization section, state the
conclusion on what are the best experimental conditions that were
used further on: e.g the best results in terms of short retention
time and good peak shape were obtained for 5 mM H3PO4 and
45 % acetonitrile, at 25 C and for a value of the applied potential
of 0.9 V.
Please delete the paragraph regarding the attempts by ion
chromatography as is not clear what is the valuable information
obtained from these experiments.
When discussing the optimization of the applied voltage,
support your claims of side reactions leading to weaker
fluorescence with literature citations, e.g. if it is known from
literature that at higher potentials than 0.9 V 3,4,5,6-
tetradehydroreserpine is formed and if is known whether it has a
different excitation/emission spectra than 3,4, dehydroreserpine
please mention it and cite the appropriate literature references.
Response: The proposed method included two main parts: 1)
chromatographic analysis; 2) electro-oxidised derivatization. So it
might be better that the section about optimization of electro-oxidation
was independent.
Thank you for the advice and we condensed the graphs of
optimization in a single figure (Figs. 5a-5e) to make the result clear for
readers. At the end of each subsection and the optimization section, we
specified the best experimental conditions.
The paragraph regarding the ion chromatography was deleted. In
regard to the part of the optimization of the applied voltage, to date
there is no literature to support or figure out what side reaction it is.
Because it was the first time to use the electro-oxidised derivatization
through a home-made electrolytic cell device combined with
chromatographic analysis for the detection of reserpine. Thus we
specified “This phenomenon might be attributed to some side effects
and the products might yield weaker fluorescence intensity compared
with that of 0.9 V.” The different excitation/emission maxima of these
compounds were reported in many previous work, such as Ref. 16 and
it was mentioned in the third paragraph, section 3.1.
But it will be a potentially valuable work to figure out what the
side reaction in the next study. Thank you sincerely.
4. Section 3.3. Choice of detection wavelength. Since this was
already reported in Section 3.1, section 3.3 is redundant and
should be eliminated, with the info moved to section 3.1.
Response: We deleted this paragraph. The relevant info was moved.
5. Section 3.5.3 Comparison with other methods: the paragraph
detailing the characteristics of the porous Ti electrode and why the
authors believe that their method is better than others should be
inserted after the Table comparing your method with others.
First, refer to results in Table 2, comment on the advantages
of the presented approach compared to other methods and
afterwards explain why you think that your method is good,
something like: we attribute the good characteristics of our
method to …and add your explanation.
Please rephrase “Table S1 shows that the usual range of
serum drug level (as discussed in Section 1) is within the linearity
of the proposed method”, it should be written the other way
around, i.e. the method is appropriate for detection in serum
considering the linear range of the method and the typical levels of
reserpine in serum.
Response: The paragraph detailing the comparison with Ti electrode
and others was listed last.
We apologise for the inaccurate presentation about this section
and reorganized it. The relevant explanation was supplemented.
6. When comparing with other methods, refer not only to the
HPLC/MS detection but also to direct and simple application of
electrochemical methods. For example, what is the advantage of
your method compared with reference 12 (adsorptive stripping
voltammetry), since the range and detection limits are similar?
Your method includes also a chromatographic separation;
therefore it should be inherently more selective.
Response: These two methods have similar linear range and detection
limits, however, up to date these electrochemical methods are
unsuitable for the online separation combined with direct detection of
reserpine. They might expressed similar sensitivity but had
disadvantages in terms of selectivity. We supplemented appropriate
comparison about these two methods in section 3.4.3. Thank you very
much.
7. Section 3.5.3, end : the assertion “Thus, our present approach is
a sensitive and reliable technique that is suitable for the analysis of
reserpine in biological samples” placed at the end of section 3.5.3
is not justified. The authors might state, that, considering the
appropriate linear range and good analytical performances of the
proposed method compared to other literature-proposed
approaches, they investigated further the applicability of their
method for analysis in serum.
8. Section 3.5.4. Analysis of reserpine in mouse serum samples,
please delete “We detected reserpine in mouse serum under the
same experimental conditions as Section 3.5.1.”, is repeating a
similar phrase from just 2 sentences above.
9. Section 3.1 second paragraph, page 13, There seems to be
something missing from the phrase “Reserpine contains available
nitrogen with an unshared pair of electrons, a two electron
oxidation occurs with formation of an N-oxide [30]. “
Response: We apologize for the vague expression and rephrased them
(suggestion 7-9). Thank you for your careful and patient advice. They
were of great use.
10. Section 3.5.4 Please correct the phrase “For comparison, we
tested blank and drug-treated mouse serum were tested.” (delete
“were tested”).
Since serum from drug-treated mouse was tested, the
information about how much reserpine was given to the mouse
should be provided.
Any information known from literature about how reserpine
is found in rat serum- whether is the intact compound or is
metabolized should be mentioned, so the reader will know what is
actually measured.
The concentration measured in the serum of drug-treated
mouse should have been confirmed by analysis with a second
method to confirm that the method is accurate, in addition with
recovery calculations of reserpine in spiked samples.
Response: We added relevant information about the sample
preparation of drug-treated mouse in section 2.4. Ref. 9 applied the
HPLC/MS method for the determination of reserpine, and its result
showed that in plasma matrix, reserpine was detected, instead of its
metabolic products.
The recovery calculations of reserpine in spiked samples were
tested and stated in section 3.4.4. The drug-treated mouse serum and
spiked samples were all analyzed and the standard addition curve was
in the range of 0.05–5.0 mg/L reserpine, with r2 of 0.9997 for spiked
mouse serum. Spiked recoveries ranged from 92.0% to 115%.
The good linearity and favorable recoveries may confirm the
method is accurate. Furthermore, supplement trial was done. A DAD
detector was used to quantify and confirm the peak purity of reserpine.
The ultraviolet scanning spectra of the analyte is shown below. The
maximum absorption peak was 268 nm, confirming that it was
reserpine. Besides, there were no relevant absorption peaks of other
interferents. (e.g. rescinnamine, 302 nm; serpentine, 309 nm).
11. Selectivity: would it be possible that some metabolites
with similar structure as reserpine co-elute with reserpine? How
did you establish the identity of the peak attributed to reserpine in
the drug-treated mouse serum? Could you confirm it by
HPLC/MS or a parallel method? For example, would it be possible
by coupling a DAD detector instead of FLD and do a peak purity
test to check that the peak attributed to reserpine is pure
reserpine? If reserpine is co-eluting with other compounds with
similar structure, how would you know what you measure exactly?
Response: Thank you for your reminder and we tried our best to do
some supplement trail. It is a pity that the HPLC/MS is limited in our
lab. However, a DAD detector was used to quantify and confirm the
peak purity of reserpine. We discussed above that there are literatures
(Ref. 9) supported that in biological fluids what they detected was
reserpine, instead of its metabolites. We used HPLC method combined
with a DAD detector, the retention time of the analyte was 9.86 min,
same as our proposed mthod. The ultraviolet scanning spectra of the
analyte was shown above. The absorption wavelength maxima was
268nm, confirming that it was reserpine. Besides, there were no
relevant absorption peaks of other interfents. (e.g. rescinnamine, 302
nm; serpentine, 309 nm).
12. Please specify that the method selectivity was evaluated
by analyzing samples of potential interfering compounds (L-dopa
and dopamine) and mention the concentration levels at which
these potential interfering compounds were tested. If none of the
known metabolites and degradation products of reserpine are
commercially, other alkaloids with similar structure as reserpine
might be available and should have been included in the selectivity
study.
Response: The relevant revision was given in the revised manuscript
(selectivity evaluation and the levels of potential interfering
compounds).
We are sorry that, to date, no such suppliers (e.g. Aladdin, Sigma)
in China support the standard of the degradation products and
metabolites (e.g. reserpic acid, rescinnamine, methyl reserpine).
Actually we considered the other related alkaloids with similar
structure such as rauwolscine, sarpagine, yohimbine, and deserpine,
however, these compounds are completely non-fluorescent at the
maximal wavelength of 3,4-dehydroreserpine [38].
13. In Table 2 the methods are mixed with the detectors, for example,
what is a “CV” detector in reference, where the method is stripping
voltammetry? Please check and correct the Table.
Response: “CV” means “cyclic voltammetry measurement”. We
rephrased it as “ECD” to make it clear.
Again, thank you for your valuable comments.
