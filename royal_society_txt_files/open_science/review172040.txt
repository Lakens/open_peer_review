In this manuscript the authors study the self-assembly behaviorsof peptide-drug conjugates; in
particular, they focus on the effects on the self-assembly due to molecular structure,
concentration, PH and hydrogen bond inhibitors, hence providing a quite complete description of
the mechanism. By means of different experimental techniques, they are able to show how the
morphology of the self-assembled aggregates depend on the specific factors considered. Due to
the importance of the investigated issue (with an extended range of possible applications, from
nanomedicine to supramolecular assembly), and the clarity of the presented results, I suggest the
publication of this manuscript. The only minor points I suggest in order to improve the clarity of
the presentation concerns Figures 5 and 7; in Figure 5 I think that the authors should use the same
size scale, in order to make the subfigures fully comparable. In Figure 7 the size scale is missing
and the authors should add it.

In this manuscript, authors presented the effects of extrinsic factors on assembly morphology and
the possible formation of nanostructures based on peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs). They
designed a PDC consisting of hydrophobic drug ketoprofen (Ket) and valine-glutamic acid
dimeric repeats peptide (VEVE). They showed assembly of nanostructures from micelle, nanorod,
nanofiber to nanoribbon. They claimed that the p-p stacking interaction could play structure-
directing role in filament-like or nanoribbon morphology.

Authors should revise the chemical representation of the molecule to show stereochemistry of the
amino acids.
Authors should cite the following study to show the morphology changes by the p-p
interactions, Langmuir, 2017, 33 (32), pp 7947-7956.
Authors should show the fluorescence emission changes of the chromophore attached to peptide
depending on the morphology.

Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her accurate evaluation of our manuscript, as well as their
interest in our work and their suggestions for its improvement. We are very grateful to the reviewer
for the comments to remind us the issue of size scales, which will promote us to be more cautious in
future. The size scales in this manuscript has been revised and adjusted to the same size scales.

In this manuscript, authors presented the effects of extrinsic factors on assembly morphology and
the possible formation of nanostructures based on peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs). They designed a
PDC consisting of hydrophobic drug ketoprofen (Ket) and valine-glutamic acid dimeric repeats peptide
(VEVE). They showed assembly of nanostructures from micelle, nanorod, nanofiber to nanoribbon.
They claimed that the p-p stacking interaction could play structure-directing role in filament-like or
nanoribbon morphology.
Authors should revise the chemical representation of the molecule to show stereochemistry of the
amino acids.
The comments from this reviewer is very constructive, and we are grateful to the reviewer for their
excellent suggestions on how to further improve our report.
Response1: We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to an argument that requires clarification
as to its context. It is our carelessness to omit some statements. We have revised the chemical
representation of the molecule to show stereochemistry of the amino acids. Besides, to be more
accurate, we also clarified the chirality of ketoprofen.
Authors should cite the following study to show the morphology changes by the p-p interactions,
Langmuir, 2017, 33 (32), pp 7947-7956.
Response2: The reviewer poses a useful article, one that provide some research methods and analysis
ideas. This publication gave us a lot guidance. We have cited it in the paragraph “Circular
dichroism(CD) spectroscopy was used to characterize the second structure of PDCs……”
Authors should show the fluorescence emission changes of the chromophore attached to peptide
depending on the morphology.
Response3: This is a great matter raised by the reviewer. In this manuscript, we utilized florescence
spectrum to investigate the critical aggregation concentration. Pyrene was exploited to function as a
probe, which is common techniques used in numerous studies. In the Fig.2, the fluorescent emission
spectra are changed due to the intensity changes of pyrene. In this manuscript, we prefer to focus on
the self-assembly study of peptide-drug conjugate (Ket-L-VEVE). The fluorescence emission changes
of the chromophore attached to peptide did not form part of our study as our intent was to investigate
the how the multiple extrinsic factors to affect our assembly behaviors, and to predict the possible
process of self-assembly. We would like to exploit this method which reviewer mentioned to continue
our later research.
Authors should compare the CD and FTIR results depending on the morphology.
Response 4: Knowledges need to keep learning. We thank the reviewer for carefully reading through
our manuscript. Under the guidance of the publication reviewer recommended, we have re-analyzed
our data about CD spectrum, and discussed in the manuscript within the part of pH influence.
Authors should discuss the stability of the resulting structures and their thermodynamics and kinetics
reasons.
Response5: This is an excellent point that we fully agree with the reviewer. As talked above, this
manuscript was proposed to conduct a preliminary explore to find out if several basic factors such as
structure, concentration, pH, H-bond inhibitor have the possibility to be modulated the structure of
PDCs for the future applications. We did consider to do research on their thermodynamics and kinetics
reasons. We are currently in the process of devising a strategy based on molecular dynamics
simulation to conduct further study about their microscopic assembly behavior. We hope that these
results can be shared with the reviewer in our future studies. If the reviewer deems these results
absolutely necessary for this manuscript, we will be happy to reconsider our position in this matter.
Authors should reveal statistical methods to prove the reproducibility of the results.
Response6: The reviewer makes a valid observation regarding an important omission in the methods
section, one for which we are grateful. PDCs as a kind of prodrugs has a lot of advantages, and one
of the most important is the stability. In this manuscript, each experiment has done more than three
copies, and the reproducibility of the results has been rigorously validated. We have clarified this point
in the method.
