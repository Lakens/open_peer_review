Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors use a double digest RAD protocol to analyse the population structure of Dascyllus
trimaculatus in the Indian Ocean. Overall, the lab protocols are well conducted, and the
population structure methods are fairly standard and appear well conducted. The main problem I
see, is with the narrative of the paper, that is slightly incoherent with the general purpose of the
study. It's not clear what the authors are trying to achieve with their focus on neutral versus
outlier in this particular case. The analyses using all loci show a very similar pattern to the
outlier, apart from the outliers separating NRS from DJI in the DAPC analyses (but not in the
structure analyses). The outlier analyses didn't provide much inference regarding potential
adaptation, and as the authors acknowledge founder effects confound the issue. I feel like the
authors would be best presenting the data from all SNPs first, and then present the neutral vs
outlier comparison as a means to show that at least some of the separation signal appears to be
driven by the outliers. This would fit better with a discussion where the potential for adaption is
raised, but not possible to confirm from the present data. On this note, I think the authors could
make a better effort in identifying potential genes in the vicinity of the outlier SNPs. The results
on this are difficult to interpret as presented, and there is not detail on how these were identified.
I also agree with previous reviewers disagreeing with conclusions that this study shows the
power of RADseq. Apart from this being well established by now, the number of SNPs is overall
very low, particularly those that were identified as outliers. Power is thus likely to be low for a
RADseq study, so authors really shouldn't be trying to argue for the power in their dataset. I also
feel that there is very little detail on the analyses at times. Some information on methods and
results are clearly lacking to allow a reader to assert whether the authors statements are accurate
or not. I've included some more information on my specific comments below.
Therefore, my assessment is that the manuscript has potential to be published in Royal Society
Open Science, but not in its current form. The authors need to address some of the weaknesses
mentioned, but crucially need to improve the narrative of the paper to make it more coherent and
focused on the questions the authors can address with this study (patterns of geographic
structure in the Indian Ocean). I agree that this is an interesting region for marine biogeography
which has receive relatively little attention, however I don't feel the manuscript emphasises this
strongly enough in its present form. I also agree with the authors comment that, even though the
study does not address a specific conservation concern, it can be used as a driver for better
conservation policies locally. There are several cases known where research papers were the
trigger for better conservation efforts, and this could be one of those cases. Therefore, I'm
recommending rejection encouraging resubmission, and I encourge the authors to address the
limitations of their manuscript more thoroughly and provide a strong resubmission.
Specific comments:
Lines 68-71: I feel this is overstated, given that differentiation is only found in the outlier loci
Lines 113-115: the Evanno et al transformation was designed for a very specific case when Ln
values constantly increase with higher levels of K. Therefore, using this method as a standard is
3
not the correct way to assess the correct value of K from a structure run. Having said that, from
the results it seems that the Evanno et al modification was not used, at least for the neutral
dataset, as with the Evanno et al method, K=1 cannot ever be the most supported level of K.
Lines 127-128: there is no information whether Bonferroni correction was applied. From Table 1 I
can see that the alpha was set to the standard 0.05, which suggests no Bonferroni correction
(although how this is implemented varies depending on software). However, pairwise Fst like
this always requires Bonferroni correction, so the authors need to make sure that Bonferroni
correction was applied.
Lines 132-133: this sentence is self-contradictory, and does not match the results shown. DAPC
clearly shows Oman separates from all others, but the structure plot does not show this
distinction. Therefore, DAPC and structure results are not in agreement.
Lines 133-134: The authors need to show the slope of the IBD regression lines. Otherwise, not
possible to assess the strength of IBD.
Lines 194-196: There is no information on how this was determined, but this is needed to
understand exactly what was done and what these results mean.
Lines 211-312: I agree with a previous reviewer that his sentence is overstated. RADseq are
widely known to provide more resolution on a number of analyses. I don't think the new
phrasing really addresses the comment. It still sounds like the authors are suggesting their study
shows the usefulness of RADseq, when this is now generally agreed on.

Review of Salas et al. - Using outlier loci to elucidate patterns of gene flow in a coral reef fish
Author: J. Derek Hogan, Associate Professor, Texas A&M University – Corpus Christi
4
This paper uses RAD sequencing to study the population genetics of a common coral reef fish in
the Indian Ocean and looks to test hypotheses about the biogeography of the region. This is a fine
paper that ultimately supports previous findings of biogeography in the Indian Ocean. The paper
is generally well written and there are no major flaws in the methods, and the results are
appropriately interpreted given the data and analyses. There is no reason not to publish this
study.
My specific comments to improve the paper are below:
Title – the novelty of RAD and outlier loci to study patterns of genetic structure in non-model
organisms is not great. I suggest refocusing the title to reflect the results of the paper rather than
focus on methods which have become common place.
Introduction:
1. L 34 – 48 - This background is too generic and a bit out of date as a justification for studies of
reef fish genetics now. Maybe 5 years ago this would have been novel enough. I think a much
more compelling justification for this study is a detailed study of biogeography and genetic
discontinuity in the Indian Ocean. There is enough work done now to devise a solid hypothesis
for how genetic patterns in Dascyllus should manifest themselves across the Indian Ocean basin.
This paper should be steeped in that literature and attempt to carve out a niche and forward a
new understanding (or support for an existing hypothesis) about genetic biogeography in the IO.
2. L 54 – 59 - You should use this literature to devise a hypothesis and then determine the novelty
of your study (first to use RAD?) then test the biogeographic hypothesis with your data and see if
you support or refute the existing paradigm.
3. L 61 – 62 - Anything unique about Dascyllus compared to other species that have been studied
in the IO so far that you might expect different results than previous studies?
4. L 62 – 63 - Is that typical of other species that have been studied in the IO? How does this
species compare to others that have been studies so far? Why did you choose this particular fish?
5. L 63 – 64 - So dispersal may be restricted like other anemone specialists (i.e., that pesky nemo).
6. L 68 – 69 - What leads you to that hypothesis if all other fishes are showing panmixia? PLD
shorter? Life-history/habitat specialization? Whats different about Dascyllus that leads you to
believe it will be different?
7. L 70 – 71 - Is this the first study to use SNPs to look at genetic biogeography of the IO?
Discussion:
1. L 194 – 196 - This doesnt seem as plausible as drift effects. IBD is inherently a neutral pattern.
Also the patterns of environmental variables in this case would not likely produce an IBD pattern
via non-neutral processes. North vs. South yes, but not IBD (at least not from what I can tell
looking as Fig S3).
2. L 198 - By isolation you mean Drift, correct?
Conclusions:
1. This conclusion section is redundant with the Discussion. Unless it is required by the journal I
suggest removing it altogether.
2. L 211 – 213 - I think this is not a novel statement any longer. Basically every RAD paper could
say this, but its getting old fast.

In their descriptive manuscript, Salas et al investigate population genetic structure in Dascyllus
trimaculatus in the Western Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. They use RAD data and compare
“neutral” and “outlier” loci, and detect subtle but significant genetic structure between the NWIO
and the WIO provinces.
While the study is purely descriptive and mostly relevant to the species being studied, most of
the analyses are solid and well established and hence I think the study would be worthy of
publication in Royal Society Open Science. However I do have some concerns over the outlier
analysis performed.
FDIST is known to be prone to false positives, particularly when the real demographic history
deviates from the island model (see for example Whitlock and Lottheros, American Naturalist
2015, Vol, 186). Furthermore, using a p-value of 0.01 one would expect > 10 outliers just by
chance. In that respect, a non-over conservative correction for multiple tests would be in order
(for example, just using the r function “p.adjust” the authors could calculate false discovery
rate?). I have a problem with analyzing separately a bunch of loci which could simply represent
the right tail of a neutral distribution of Fst. Perhaps the authors should include more robust
tests, such as OutFLANK and/or the FLK test developed by Bohnomme et al (Genetics. 2010 Sep;
186(1): 241–262.). Each of these method may be sensitive to different biases, but loci identified by
different methods may be good cancidate outliers. I think this would be required before the
manuscript can be published.
Perhaps the most could be gained using the unsupervised test developed by Kempainen
(Molecular Ecology Resources (2015) 15, 1031–1045) based on Linkage disequilibrium network
analysis (LDna). This would allow to identify loci in high LD that could be associated with both
phylogeographic structure and local adaptation. Once clusters of loci in high LD are identified,
PCA can be carried out with loci in each cluster separately. Many of these clusters will reflect
biogeography (i.e. they will separate a single population or a group of populations based on
geographic structure) but some may group individuals in different ways. These could be
candidate for local adaptation (although of course the authors should not overreach their
conclusions). While I do not consider this analysis as a conditio sine qua non for publication, I
strongly encourage the authors to have a go at it. If the authors find interesting groups of loci
with patterns contrasting with bio-geographic patterns, then they could potentially look for
association with environmental variables.
In addition, I find some statements perhaps superfluous. It is very well known (and not just in
model organisms) that increasing number of loci can help in finding subtle patterns of population
structure that are characteristic of large marine populations, and that in marine populations
(given their large Ne and gene flow) selection is more efficient. Is that truly necessary to repeat?
This sort of statement is ever more present in the introduction of many marine population
6
genetics paper. It can also be misleading in some way. While high Ne means that selection is
more efficient, it also means that LD decays very fast around selected loci (unless they are in
regions of low recombination, or in chromosomal rearrangements). Hence, low density SNPs are
likely to miss the vast majority of targets of selection (see for example discussion in Hemmer-
Hansen et al , : Biol. Bull. 227: 117–132), unless they occur in regions of low
recombination/chromosomal rearrangements.
Similarly, I think genetics is not a good proxy of population connectivity in demographic terms,
even in age of NGS and whole genome sequencing, and particularly if using metrics such as Fst.
Genetic connectivity is in itself very important for conservation and management, and so it’s
identifying local adaptation. But as the introduction is written it seems as if we get more loci we
can get estimates that are meaningful in demographic terms, which is very often not the case. My
suggestion would be to get rid of some of these “trite” statements and say something more about
the biology/ecology of the species, as this is a descriptive paper mostly of interest to coral reef
scientists and more specifically to the ones interested in this species. But again, this is just an
advice that the authors may feel free to ignore.
The authors could also explore a bit more their data. For example, what are patterns of diversity
across the range ? Metrics like heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity (pi) and Tajima's D could
also help getting a better picture of the phylogeographic history of the species.

also help getting a better picture of the phylogeographic history of the species.

I think the narrative is much improved and more cohesive. The paper now reads very well, and
highlights the study strengths very clearly. I lso think that the authors have addressed my
comments satisfactorily, and I'm happy with the revisions made.
There are just a few minor comments I have to improve the manuscript. One is that the authors
should revise the writing carefully for minor sentence construction problems. Note that the
writing is generally very good and clear, bu there are only some minor imperfections that can be
easily ironed out and make the writing a bit neater.
Thanks for including the IBD numerical results. Looking at those, it seems there is no IBD really,
so I suggest the authors phrase their results and discussion accordingly. I understand the p-value
is significant for outliers, but the slope is very low and the the model fit is also poor, so personally
I don't see strong evidence for IBD in either case.
Regardless, I feel this is a strong paper in support of an interesting and well carried out study. I'm
therefore happy to recommend this paper be accepted for publication.

Comments to the Author(s)

I think the authors did a good job revising the manuscript. I am still curious as to why the authors
decided to present the outliers/neutral snps analyses separately, as the tests for outliers they
perform are prone to false discoveries, and only one test identified the loci analyzed. It would
perhaps have made more sense to present in the main paper the analyses with all the snps, and in
the supplementary materials the neutral/outlier datasets. In any case, the authors do not
overstate the importance of the outlier analyses, so i think that is not big issue. I do have a few
minor comments that the authors should consider before the paper is published:
Line 19: there does not seem to be any test specifically targeted at detecting gene flow. Low Fst
can be due to ongoing gene flow, or also to recent ancestry and large Ne or secondary contact. In
large marine pops it may not be always straightforward to discern between these, and it can't be
done just by looking at Fst.
Line 40: "Entity", would "region" be better?
Line 112-113: if PLD is a poor predictor of dispersal, while should it explain genetic connectivity?
Line 203: "discern the adaptive value". slightly odd phrasing, also even if matches were found it
may be difficult to do so without phenotypic and
environmental data
Line 256: the results do not necessarily suggest that gene flow is variable across the genome,
though this is possible. For example, recombination rate variation can provide a sufficient
explanation for islands of divergence, with no necessity for restricted gene flow due to, for
example, environmental selection or Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. Butti shows this
nicely in a review/perspective paper: where recombination is low, local Ne is lower, and lower
diversity creates islands of differentiation due to drift and background selection.

e 112-113: if PLD is a poor predictor of Thanks… Actually, our primary intention here was
persal, while should it explain genetic to illustrate with the PLD study that the
nnectivity? environmental gradient found in the Red Sea
could have an effect on D. trimaculatus life
history, and this in turn could affect its genetic
structure… due to many reasons. Among those,
one reason may be restricted dispersal due to
shorter PLD, but there could be many other
reasons, like changes in fitness either in the adult
or larval stages that could drive selection.
Now, to answer your question: Most studies
show a lack of relationship between PLD and
dispersal (unless PLD is too short)… however this
relationship still needs to be tested in more
detail. Most studies to date compare many
species with different PLDs, but do not carefully
factor in the geographic and temporal variation of
PLD within a species… so we believe that the idea
that PLD doesn’t affect dispersal cannot be
completely refuted. We missed a little more
explanation there.
Anyways, we were trying to say a lot of things, so
we will simplify our argument to focus on the
primary point.
We replaced this text:
In the Red Sea, the pelagic larval duration (PLD) of
D. trimaculatus decreases as sea surface
temperatures and food availability increase from
north to south [33]. Although PLD’s are poor
predictors of dispersal [34], this might affect
genetic connectivity between the Red Sea and
adjacent regions.
With:
In the Red Sea, the pelagic larval duration (PLD) of
D. trimaculatus, D. aruanus and D. marginatus
decrease as sea surface temperatures and food
availability increase from north to south [33].
These results suggest that local environment
variation affects the life history of D.
trimaculatus, which in turn might influence its
genetic structure.
