Review of RSOS-172453, Tsai & Fordyce
by Erich Fitzgerald (Museums Victoria)
This is a well-crafted, clearly presented and superbly illustrated description of an enigmatic yet
informative new species of early baleen whale from the Oligocene of New Zealand. I find the
conclusions reasonable based on the available evidence, and the anatomical and phylogenetic
evidence for this fossil being a new species quite convincing. I therefore recommend publication
after minor revision. I only have 20 trivial suggested corrections and comments on the
manuscript (see the annotated PDF attached.) The only other recommendation I make to the
authors is to check the contrast/brightness in the periotic figures (Figs. 6 and 7): these look a bit
too washed-out to me and could benefit from being less bright.
Otherwise, this is good to go! (Appendix B)

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Denise Greig):
Both reviewers are supportive of the taxonomic conclusions in the manuscript and offer useful
and detailed comments. One reviewer suggested careful proofreading of the introduction and
discussion to improve clarity which is a suggestion that I agree with. As an example, on line 44,
the sentence "when and how mysticetes became obligate baleen-feeders is moot" is confusing to
me especially because you do spend a fair amount of time discussing how mysticetes might have
become baleen feeders. The taxonomic descriptions on the other hand are clear and detailed.

Comments to the Author:
Thank you for your thorough response to the reviewers and excellent revision.
I just have one tiny question about the abstract:
In this sentence "The mandible is bowed laterally and slightly dorsally; unlike the
Eomysticetidae,
there are no multiple mandibular alveoli, and the coronoid process is tapered and curved
laterally."
Can the word "multiple" be deleted?
From line 168, I understand that there are no mandibular alveoli.

Appendix A
Comments on Tsai and Fordyce (2018): A new archaic baleen whale, Toipahautea waitaki (early
Late Oligocene, New Zealand) and the origins of crown Mysticeti
This paper describes a new, early Late Oligocene chaeomysticete from the South Island of New
Zealand. This paper is one of a series of descriptions from this area, and a very welcome contribution
to the still somewhat patchy Southern Hemisphere cetacean fossil record. The new species,
Toipahautea, is important for being one of the oldest toothless mysticetes, and helps to calibrate the
origin of modern toothless whales.
I have no issues with the taxonomic conclusions of the paper. The data on the age and locality of the
specimen are detailed and convincing. The figures are generally well done. Overall, the paper is need
of proofreading to fix some typos and minor grammatical issues. This is especially true of parts of the
introduction and the discussion, which I occasionally had trouble following. The need to proofread is
really the only reason why I chose major revisions – the core of the paper is fine as is.
Below, I am listing some detailed comments and observations. All of these are minor, except for my
notes on the last section of the discussion (point 12 below).
1) l. 23 and l. 166-167: the coronoid process is also curved laterally in eomysticetids. This is
particularly evident in Yamatocetus. See photo of the right mandible below.
2) l. 108: rather than, or in addition to, simple scaling with Horopeta, total body length could be
estimated based on the equation of Pyenson et al. (2013)
3) l. 169-170: “the profile of tympanic bulla more rounded instead of dorsoventrally compressed”;
in what view?
4) l. 171-172: I thought Horopeta showed at least a certain degree of lateral deflection of the
mandible? There are statements to that effect in Tsai and Fordyce (2015), e.g. “coronoid
process of mandible deflected posterolaterally”. Maybe the coronoid is *more* curved in
Toipahautea than in Horopeta? Please clarify.
5) l. 204: for clarity, it might be useful here to cite the discussion of the posterior sinus/ stylohyal
articulation in Marx and Fordyce (2016) .
6) l. 217: what is the “body” of the squamosal?
7) l. 340: in this context, what is the difference between “oval” and “elliptical”?
8) l. 380: do you mean “periotic” instead of “tympanic bulla”?
9) l. 460: why is the radius not figured? I think an additional photo here would be a good idea.
10) l. 527 and 537–539: Thewissen et al. (2017) suggest that some of the developmental signalling
(and thus likely genetic control) normally responsible for tooth formation has become involved
in baleen ontogeny
11) l. 530: “†Aetiocetidae and †Eomysticetidae, had both teeth and baleen”; maybe better: “may
have had both teeth and baleen”
12) l. 556-597: Feeding mode in early Mysticeti. This section summarises recent discussions on the
origin of baleen and filter feeding, and suggests that most or all Oligocene mysticetes were
effectively versatile generalists that could employ a variety of strategies depending on the
feeding scenario. I broadly agree with this interpretation, but there are some points that I think
need to be taken into consideration.
First, I am not entirely sure how this section follows on from the remainder of the paper.
Toipahautea appears to be the oldest chaeomysticete with baleen and no teeth. As such, it
constrains the time when modern mysticete filter feeding arose; it does not, however, offer
new data on how the tooth-baleen transition itself occurred. I think it would be beneficial to
clarify whether the discussion in this section is based on new data provided in the paper, or
whether it is merely a comment on previous research.
Secondly, as currently worded, this section seems to imply that earlier studies on the tooth-
baleen transition argued for specialisation. I don’t think is true. The idea that early mysticetes
were versatile in their feeding mode is not new. In fact, virtually *all* papers discussing the
tooth-baleen transition implicitly or explicitly acknowledge that more than one strategy must
have been at play. For example, Demere and Berta (2008) interpret aetiocetids as capable of
both raptorial and incipient filter feeding; Marx et al. (2016) suggest that mysticetes
transitioned from raptorial, to raptorial + suction, to suction + filtering; Hocking et al. (2017b)
specifically stress the versatility of individual species in their behavioural framework; Hocking et
al. (2017a) suggest a mix of raptorial and suction feeding for Coronodon; and Geisler et al.
(2017) make it clear that their dental filtration hypothesis does not preclude suction. Rather
than trying to argue for specialisation as such, previous studies tried to delimit the *range* of
strategies that were used by particular species. I think the present paper needs to make this
clear, and acknowledge that feeding versatility has always been part of the debate.
Thirdly, I think it is maybe too simplistic to think of all Oligocene mysticetes as generalists
capable of using whatever feeding suited them at the time. For example, Yamatocetus probably
did not feed raptorially, and Mammalodon probably did not filter. As stated in the paper, early
mysticetes are notably disparate, ranging from bizarre forms like Mammalodon all the way to
Toipahautea. It seems almost inconceivable to me that such a degree of morphological diversity
is not at least in part driven by specialisation. Otherwise, why evolve the marked differences
between, say, mammalodontids and stem plicogulans in the first place?
Finally, I am not convinced that using generalisation as a way to explain the tooth-baleen
transition is really that fruitful. At present, the manuscript seems to portray the term as a kind
of ‘black box’ into which raptorial feeder descend, and from which filter feeders emerge, with
no hint of how one changed into the other. This seems somewhat simplistic, and brings with it
the danger of making hypothesis on the tooth-baleen transition virtually untestable: if all of the
animals involved were always capable of everything, then no inference can ever be refuted. I
agree that the transition from raptorial to filter feeding likely was neither straightforward nor
particularly constrained (i.e. there presumably were plenty of side-braches and dead ends).
Nevertheless, at some point it had to follow some form of evolutionary trajectory, which
resulted in a measureable change in capabilities, morphology and behaviour. Generalisation as
a way to smooth the transition is certainly plausible, but can go only so far. Even if some species
at the heart of the transition were capable of several strategies (I agree that this is rather likely),
the frequency with which particular strategies were employed, and the morphological and
behavioural adaptations enabling them, would have changed over time. Previous studies
acknowledged feeding versatility, but also tried to generate more specific hypotheses as to
which species were capable of which strategies (or range of strategies). Ultimately, this strikes
me as a more useful approach, even though I of course agree that we need to bear in mind how
versatile, and sometimes random, evolution can be.

17 Abstract
25
26 18 A new genus and species of extinct baleen whale, †Toipahautea waitaki (Late Oligocene, New Zealand) is
27 19 based on a skull and associated bones, from the lower Kokoamu Greensand, about 27.5 Ma (local upper
28
20 Whaingaroan Stage, early Chattian). The upper jaw includes a thin, elongate, and apparently toothless maxilla,
29
30 21 with evidence of arterial supply for baleen. Open sutures with the premaxilla suggest a flexible (kinetic) upper
31 22 jaw. The blowhole is well forward. The mandible is bowed laterally and slightly dorsally; unlike the
32
23 Eomysticetidae, there are no multiple mandibular teeth, and the coronoid process is tapered and curved laterally.
33
34 24 Jaw structure is consistent with baleen-assisted gulp-feeding. The age of early Chattian makes †Toipahautea a
35 25 very early, if not the oldest named, toothless and baleen-bearing mysticete, suggesting that the full transition
36
37
26 from toothed to baleen-bearing probably occurred in the early Oligocene. Late Oligocene mysticetes vary
38 27 considerably in jaw form and kinesis, tooth form and function, and development of baleen, implying a wide
39 28 range of raptorial, suctorial, and filter-feeding behaviour. More study may elucidate the function of jaws, teeth
40
41 29 and baleen in terms of opportunist/generalist feeding, as in modern gray whales, versus specialized feeding. We
42 30 here propose that early mysticetes, when transitioned from toothed to baleen-bearing, were generalists and
43 31 opportunists instead of specialising in any forms of feeding strategies. In addition, two different phylogenetic
44
45 32 analyses placed †Toipahautea either in a polytomy including crown Mysticeti, or immediately basal to the
46 33 crown, and above †Eomysticetidae in both cases. Because the †Toipahautea waitaki holotype is an immature
47 34 individual, it may plot more basally in phylogeny than its true position.

3 41 The origin of baleen and microphagous feeding by cetaceans marks a major evolutionary breakthrough, leading
4 42 ultimately to the emergence of the largest animal, the blue whale Balaenoptera musculus (Cetacea: Mysticeti).
5
43 Recent descriptions and interpretations of new fossil whales have greatly improved understanding of early
6
7 44 mysticete evolution [e.g. 1–8]. But, when and how mysticetes became obligate baleen-feeders is moot. The
8 45 extinct clades †Aetiocetidae and †Eomysticetidae help to understand transitional stages from toothed to baleen-
9
46 bearing in mysticete evolution. Aetiocetids had fully-erupted teeth, perhaps associated with proto-baleen [9, but
10
11 47 also see 5,6], while eomysticetids had well developed baleen, sometimes with remnant teeth [e.g. 1]. But, the
12 48 Oligocene record is not yet dense enough to show clear ancestor-descendant successions in species with teeth
13
14 49 only, teeth-and-baleen, and baleen-only [see 10 for how such ancestry might be recognised in a phylogenetic
15 50 framework] Further, the rostrum - typically with thin bones and open sutures - often does not preserve well
16 51 except in concretionary specimens which in turn may be of demanding preparation.
17
18 52 Here we describe a new genus and species of Mysticeti from the lower part of the Kokoamu Greensand,
19 53 in the Canterbury Basin of southern New Zealand. Foraminiferal dating, elaborated below, places the whale in
20 54 the uppermost Whaingaroan local stage, about 27.5 Ma, making the whale one of the oldest described baleen
21
22 55 whales other than Eomysticetidae and other more stem-ward mysticetes. The source horizon is about 2 m above
23 56 the intensely bioturbated globally widespread "middle" Oligocene unconformity, in turn close to the Rupelian-
24 57 Chattian boundary. Baleen is inferred by the presence of a skeletal correlate on the maxilla: the presumed sulcus
25
26 58 for the superior alveolar artery. The specimen has well-preserved tympanoperiotic bones which, in Cetacea,
27 59 have provide useful phylogenetic signal and diagnostic power [7,11–14].

31 62
32
63 Anatomical terminology follows Mead & Fordyce [15], modified and/or supplemented by [1,7,13], especially
33
34 64 for the mysticete periotic and tympanic bulla. Here, the purpose of our cladistic analysis is to plot the position of
35 65 a new archaic mysticete, OU 21981, rather than to resolve details of mysticete phylogeny. Thus, we added OU
36
37
66 21981 into the Tsai and Fordyce matrix [13], including 91 taxa (one archaeocete as an outgroup, three
38 67 odontocetes and 87 mysticetes) and 272 morphological characters (originally derived from Marx and Fordyce
39 68 [16]). The original codings were retained to facilitate comparison with published phylogenies. In total, 105
40
41 69 characters were coded for OU 21981, representing 38.6% of 272 characters. Details of morphological coding for
42 70 OU 21981 is as follows (? = missing or inapplicable):

50 76 Cladistic analyses were performed with heuristic analyses under the traditional search in “Tree analysis using
51
77 New Technology” (TNT v1.1 [17]). Settings for analyses are: 10,000 maximum trees in the Memory option;
52
53 78 10,000 random stepwise-addition replicates; tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branch swapping; saving 10
54 79 trees per replicate. Likewise, we present two different phylogenies that result from different settings (equal and
55
80 implied weights, k = 3) to optimize comparisons with results of Tsai and Fordyce [13]. Given that the majority

22 95 Holotype. †Toipahautea waitaki is known only from the holotype, OU 21981: a disarticulated partial skull (parts
23 96 of the maxillae and premaxillae, left nasal, frontals, squamosals, exoccipitals, basioccipital, and supraoccipital),
24 97 incomplete mandibles, left bulla and periotic, hyoid(?), atlas, axis, two thoracic vertebrae, two scapulae, a partial
25
26 98 humerus, two radii, and ribs. Most of the elements were disarticulated but associated when excavated.
27 99
28
100 Preservation, Size and Ontogenetic Age. The skull was preserved ventral-up; Fig. 1C shows preparation of the
29
30 101 underside, which is dominated by dorsal faces of many bones. The right mandible was medial (lingual)-up,
31 102 while the left mandible was obliquely dorsomedial; the exposed surfaces in both show polished erosion,
32
103 presumably bioerosion.
33
34 104 The occipital condyles preserve an almost complete outline (width: 92.3 mm), though the margins are
35 105 eroded; not ideal, but for now it is then used to compare with that of †Horopeta umarere (143.8 mm, estimated
36
37
106 skull length: 1.5–1.6 m) to estimate the skull length of OU 21981; simple scaling suggests that the condylobasal
38 107 length of OU 21981 is about 1 m. In turn, based on simple scaling between †Horopeta umarere and OU 21981,
39 108 OU 21981 had a body about 5 m long, smaller than †Horopeta umarere (6.5 to 7.5 m).
40
41 109 The open basioccipital/basisphenoid synchondrosus suggests that OU 21981 is a physically immature
42 110 individual, although still uncertain to be a juvenile or sub-adult in a broad age class, based on the ontogenetic
43 111 sequence of ossification in extant balaenopteroids [18]. Some posterior rostral elements are articulated,
44
45 112 suggesting firm or closed sutures, although other sutures are open (e.g. exoccipital-squamosal); again, this is
46 113 consistent with physical immaturity. On the atlas, the condyloid facets (articular surfaces) for the occipital
47 114 condyles are smooth, without the pitting seen in juvenile mysticetes. In spite of the vagaries of preservation, and
48
49 115 some possibly immature morphology, we show below that OU 21981 is sufficiently informative to establish a
50 116 new species with emphasis on distinct and diagnostic tympanoperiotic morphology.

53 118 Locality and Horizon. OU 21981 (field number REF-28.1.88.2) was recovered from the Hakataramea Valley,
54 119 South Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand (Fig. 1). It was collected by REF, A. Grebneff, and C.M. Jones
55
120 on 28-30 January 1988 from an active quarry, known informally as Haughs’ Quarry; at time of collecting, the

2
3 121 quarry was owned by Foveran Station and operated by Waitaki Transport Limited. The latitude and longitude
4 122 are 44o39’41”S and 170o39’00”E; the New Zealand Fossil Record number is I40/f0173
5
123 (http://www.fred.org.nz/), with the associated grid reference of I40: 2323565 5613665. The type location is
6
7 124 about 20 m east of the site of †Horopeta umarere, and 2 m lower in the section
8 125 On stratigraphy, OU 21981 (I40/f0173) is from massive bioturbated to diffuse-bedded limonitic
9
126 calcareous greensand with sparse macroinvertebrates (mainly Lentipecten scallops, and terebratulid brachiopods)
10
11 127 and abundant foraminifera. The horizon is the lower part of the incompletely exposed Kokoamu Greensand, 1-
12 128 1.3 m below a diffuse brachiopod-pectinid rich shellbed (I40/f0175) that is also conspicuous elsewhere in the
13
14 129 southern Canterbury Basin. The brachiopod-pectinid rich shellbed generally occurs low in the Kokoamu
15 130 Greensand, and has long been taken to approximate the base of the Duntroonian Stage.
16 131 REF provided matrix from the OU 21981 (I40/f0173) whale horizon, and adjacent higher levels
17
18 132 (I40/f0174, and the brachiopod-pectinid rich shellbed at I40/f0175), to Hornibrook for studies on the
19 133 biostratigraphy of the benthic foraminiferan Notorotalia. Hornibrook [19: Plate 15, column] identified
20 134 I40/f0174, which overlies the OU 21981 whale horizon, as the lowest occurrence of the Duntroonian index
21
22 135 foraminiferan N. spinosa. Accordingly, I40/f0174 is the base of the Duntroonian stage, dated at 27.3 Ma and
23 136 low in the Chattian (correlations from Raine et al. [20]).
24 137 Foraminifera from the OU 21981 (I40/f0173) whale horizon include Notorotalia cf. N. stachei
25
26 138 macrostachei (REF observations), identified by the lack of regular dorsal ornament of N. spinosa: the latter is
27 139 seen in the overlying I40/f0174. Thus, OU 21981 is upper Whaingaroan in age, more than 27.3 Ma and for
28
140 convenience rounded to 27.5 Ma. See Tsai and Fordyce [7] for further details of geological settings.
29
30 141
31 142 Etymology. Toi means origin and pahautea refers to whalebone/baleen in Maori, alluding to the origin of the
32
143 early toothless and baleen-bearing mysticetes. Waitaki indicates the type locality where the type specimen, OU
33
34 144 21981, was found.
35 145
36
37
146 Diagnosis. †Toipahautea waitaki is interpreted as a chaeomysticete based on the presence of ‘baleen’ sulci on
38 147 the ventral surface of the maxilla and lack of functional mandibular teeth. †Toipahautea waitaki has a unique
39 148 combination of: massive size of periotic; well-developed superior process of the periotic; prominent elongation
40
41 149 of dorsomedial margin of the internal acoustic meatus; prominent fissure between the fenestra rotunda and the
42 150 aperture for the cochlear aqueduct; small medial posterior sulcus; presence of the anteroexternal foramen;
43 151 presence of the sigmoidal cavity; presence of the elliptical foramen; horizontal sigmoidal cleft far anterior than
44
45 152 the anterior margin of the sigmoidal process; posteromedial margin of the bulla orienting slightly anteromedially.
46 153 †Toipahautea waitaki differs from Oligocene toothed mysticetes (unranked †Coronodon havensteini,
47 154 †Aetiocetidae and near-coeval/near sympatric †Mammalodontidae) in: greater condylobasal length; maxillae
48
49 155 dorsoventrally thin and inferred to be long and laterally shelving; lack of functional teeth; rectangular
50 156 supraorbital process of the frontal with mediolateral width greater than anteroposterior length; postorbital
51
157 process of the frontal less developed; paroccipital process of the exoccipital extends posteriorly beyond the level
52
53 158 of the occipital condyles; laterally deflected coronoid process; larger periotic and bulla; well-developed superior
54 159 process; dorsal elongation of posterodorsal margin of the internal acoustic meatus; presence of the
55
160 anteroexternal foramen.

3 161 †Toipahautea waitaki differs from near-coeval/near sympatric baleen-bearing †Eomysticetidae in: lack
4 162 of secondary squamosal fossa; robust supraorbital process with prominent pre- and postorbital processes;
5
163 paroccipital process of the exoccipital extends posteriorly beyond the level of the occipital condyles; larger and
6
7 164 more inflated periotic; well-developed superior process; dorsal elongation of posterodorsal margin of the
8 165 internal acoustic meatus; tabular posterior process of the periotic slightly oriented ventrally; rounded-oblique
9
166 posterior face on tympanic bulla, rather than a bilobed profile with interprominential notch; triangular and
10
11 167 laterally deflected coronoid process.
12 168 †Toipahautea waitaki differs from Oligocene †Sitsqwayk in: a rectangular and anteroposteriorly
13
14 169 elongated supraorbital process of frontal; the profile of tympanic bulla more rounded instead of dorsoventrally
15 170 compressed; absence of distinct interprominential notch;
16 171 differs from near-coeval/near sympatric †Horopeta umarere in: laterally deflected coronoid process of the
17
18 172 mandible; larger pars cochlearis; dorsal elongation of posterodorsal margin of the internal acoustic meatus;
19 173 better-defined mallear fossa; more deeply excavated median promontorial ridge; differs from near-coeval/near
20 174 sympatric †Whakakai waipata in: triangular anterior process of the periotic in medial view; small medial
21
22 175 posterior sulcus; cylindrical and dorsoventrally narrow posterior process of the periotic.
23 176 †Toipahautea waitaki OU 21981 differs from all more crown-ward baleen-bearing mysticetes
24 177 (Balaenopteridae, Cetotheriidae/Neobalaenidae, Balaenidae, Eschrichtiidae, †Parietobalaena, and †Diorocetus
25
26 178 and others) in tympanoperiotic features including: unfused posterior processes of the periotic and tympanic bulla;
27 179 the presence of a fovea epitubaria for the accessory ossicle on the ventral margin of the anterior process; a well-
28
180 developed superior process; presence of a sigmoidal cavity; presence of an elliptical foramen; marked horizontal
29
30 181 inflection on the sigmoid cleft of the sigmoid process.

32
183 4. Description/Results
33
34 184
35 185 Skull (Figs. 2–4). The left frontal is slightly displaced and cemented by limonitic matrix to adjacent bones. The
36
37
186 relative position of preserved skull parts as arranged in Fig. 2 is based on a referred specimen of Mauicetus
38 187 parki (OU 22545); the left frontal complex, including nasal, premaxilla, and maxilla, is oriented based on the
39 188 assumption that main anteroposterior axis of nasal is parallel with the main axis of the skull. In addition, the
40
41 189 right frontal preserves the midline suture; when reflected, the right frontal closely matches the orientation of the
42 190 left frontal presented in Fig. 2 (the left frontal does not preserve the midline suture). There are some
43 191 disarticulated bones, which are noted below if the associated features are revealing. Measurements are listed in
44
45 192 Table 1.
46 193
47 194 Occipitals. The supraoccipital is largely missing, retaining the portion anterodorsal to the foramen magnum; the
48
49 195 supraoccipital, basioccipital, and exoccipitals are fused. The profile of the supraoccipital is uncertain, but based
50 196 on the remaining part anterior to the foramen magnum, it probably rose forwards at about 45 degrees. The
51
197 exoccipitals are relatively complete, with small and laterally eroded occipital condyles and posterolaterally
52
53 198 oriented paroccipital processes. The lateral and ventral margins of the occipital condyles are eroded (width of
54 199 occipital condyles: 92.3 mm; compare atlas width, below), but consistent with short condyloid pedicles. Each
55
200 condyle is roughly crescentic with a deep ventral intercondyloid notch. The foramen magnum is elliptical. Each

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 6 of 33
1
2
3 201 exoccipital is eroded along the margins, thin, and roughly vertical-oriented; the paroccipital process forms
4 202 lateral flanges and orients posterolaterally so that the posteriormost point of the paroccipital process is far
5
203 posterior to the condyles; there is no clear trace of stylohyal articulation or fossa for a posterior sinus which, as
6
7 204 indicated by an open elliptical foramen, was presumably present.
8 205 The right dorsal condyloid fossa is more developed than the left side; the depression is about thumb-
9
206 size and descends lateroventrally from the level of the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum to a point the half
10
11 207 of the dorsoventral height of the foramen magnum. The jugular notch is broadly rounded, wide, ventrolateral to
12 208 the occipital condyles in posterior view, and passes up into the braincase via a broad shallow groove without a
13
14 209 visible hypoglossal foramen. The basioccipital forms a semicircular arcade in posterior view, with the crests
15 210 curving down laterally. In ventral view, each basioccipital crest is eroded and bulbous, with uncertain
16 211 orientation; there is no obvious contribution of exoccipital. Anteriorly, the surface of the basioccipital is eroded;
17
18 212 judging from the anterior surface of the basioccipital and a partial disarticulated basisphenoid, the
19 213 basioccipital/basisphenoid synchondrosis is open. The right basisphenoid contains the presumed dorsal carotid
20 214 foramen, which is ovoid to slit-like, 15.5 mm in diameter, and oriented dorsomedially.
21
22 215
23 216 Squamosal. The squamosals retain the squamosal fossa, mandibular fossa, periotic fossa, and posterior (meatal)
24 217 margins, but each lacks the body and the zygomatic process. Both squamosals can be roughly articulated close
25
26 218 to the exoccipital within a few mm, with the periotic in place; when both squamosals are articulated with the
27 219 exoccipital, the width from the lateral margin of left squamosal to the midline (centre of foramen magnum) is
28
220 about 235 mm, making the estimated width across both squamosals 470 mm. In dorsal view, the squamosal
29
30 221 fossa descends anteroventrally roughly at 45 degrees (preserved anteroposterior length: 119 mm point-point).
31 222 Ventrally, the mandibular fossa is roughly rectangular to circular, moderately concave, and gently eroded in
32
223 front of the anterior meatal crest; the left mandibular fossa is roughly 86 mm long by 108 mm wide. The ventral
33
34 224 margin of the anterior meatal crest is eroded; thus, the shape of postglenoid process is uncertain, but it descends
35 225 roughly 45 degrees posteroventrally. The external acoustic meatus is dorsoventrally shallow proximally and
36
37
226 expands dorsoventrally distally, forming a triangular surface in posterior view (Fig. 3a); the distal part of the
38 227 posterior meatal crest abruptly (~60 degrees) ascends dorsolaterally at about 50 mm away from the periotic
39 228 fossa. The posterior process of the bulla is missing, and the few long and shallow depressions on the posterior
40
41 229 surface of the external acoustic meatus do not clearly indicate the size, contacts, and lateral extent of the
42 230 posterior process of the bulla. The spiny process is not well developed, but marks a gentle, rounded depression.
43 231 The falciform process, anterior to the spiny process, is shelf-like, semicircular, and on the median edge of the
44
45 232 mandibular fossa. The periotic fossa is largely rounded and gently concave. When the periotic is articulated in
46 233 the periotic fossa, the posterior process of the periotic is oriented posterolaterally and terminates about 25 mm
47 234 away from the periotic fossa, far away from the lateral surface of the skull; thus, the skull is amastoid. The
48
49 235 lateral tuberosity is not well developed. When the periotic sits against the periotic fossa, the space between the
50 236 anteroexternal sulcus of the periotic and the periotic fossa presumably marks the path of middle meningeal
51
237 artery; the lateral tuberosity is not protruding beyond the level of the falciform process.
52
53 238
54 239 Frontal. The left frontal is well preserved dorsally, rectangular to slightly dumb-bell shaped in dorsal view; the
55
240 right frontal is partly preserved (Fig. 2). Sutures with adjacent bones are eroded by a few mm, so that contacts

2
3 241 are uncertain. Anteriorly, the straight anterolateral margin of the supraorbital process, close to the antorbital
4 242 notch of the maxilla, orients posterolaterally; the anteromedial margin of the supraorbital process is eroded and
5
243 slightly concave posterior to the maxilla. Three possible dorsal frontal foramina are present on the right frontal
6
7 244 (the left frontal shows no trace of foramina, possibly because of erosion) and open dorsally to anterodorsally.
8 245 The posterior margin of the supraorbital process is concave in dorsal view, with a shallow
9
246 orbitotemporal crest along the posterodorsal margin and a postorbital ridge - eroded laterally - below. The two
10
11 247 ridges delimit a shallow, wide fossa for the m temporalis on the posterior face of the frontal, partly visible
12 248 ventrally.

14 249 The lateral margin of the orbit is concave, viewed dorsally, with the eroded postorbital process more
15 250 lateral than the preorbital process; the postorbital process is prolonged posterolaterally. Orbital length is about
16 251 100.0 mm, and dorsoventral depth 38.0 mm. In ventral view, the roof of the orbit between the preorbital and
17
18 252 postorbital ridges forms a concave, subconical surface with little erosion. Two foramina are presumably for the
19 253 frontal diploic vein.
20 254 Other ventral features are damaged. The triangular and slightly convex surface on the postorbital
21
22 255 process is eroded, without any distinct facet to oppose the tip of the zygomatic process of the squamosal; the
23 256 postorbital ridge is damaged here, but is present medially. Anteriorly, two somewhat polished eroded tabular
24 257 surfaces of frontal indicate the suture for the lacrimal, and the surface facing the infraorbital process of the
25
26 258 maxilla (Fig. 4a, c). The tabular region for the missing lacrimal is long, rectangular, and oriented ventromedially,
27 259 consistent with a loosely sutured thin plate-like lacrimal. The tabular surface opposing the infraorbital process of
28
260 the maxilla (missing) is trapezoid and oriented ventrally. The preorbital ridge is eroded laterally, but developed
29
30 261 medially, where it carries a subcircular sulcus, probably from the ethmoid foramen (by analogy with
31 262 Balaenoptera bonaerensis). The orbitosphenoid is not visible.
32
263 Ventrally, the turbinate region (Fig. 4a, b) is broadly sub-spherical and oriented slightly medioventrally;
33
34 264 the dimension is about 45 x 32 mm, and up to 20 mm deep. The turbinate region includes three prominent and
35 265 up to 13 (broken) nasal turbinates on the ventromedial margin and marks the presence of ethmoid labyrinth or
36
37
266 olfactory recess; the turbinates are thin and fine ridges. There is no trace of paranasal sinus lateral to the
38 267 turbinates.
39 268
40
41 269 Nasal. The left nasal (Fig. 2, 4a) is long, narrow, and rectangular (preserved length: 244.8 mm; width: 34 mm),
42 270 and dorsoventrally flattened; the dorsal surface is flat while the eroded ventral surface shows a long and gently
43 271 concave groove along the entire nasal. The anterior margin is eroded, but judging from the curvature of the
44
45 272 premaxilla lateral to the nasal, the preserved nasal includes the anterior end at the posterior margin of the narial
46 273 fossa. Posteriorly, the margin is eroded and profile uncertain, but at least it reaches to the level of
47 274 anteroposterior midline of the frontal. The lateral face of the nasal is slightly overlain by the premaxilla on the
48
49 275 ventral surface, but not on the dorsal surface.
50 276
51
277 Rostrum. The posterior portion of the maxilla indicates a broad and thin rostrum, as noted during the field
52
53 278 excavation and widely seen in other baleen-bearing Plicoguli. Eight disarticulated pieces are provisionally
54 279 identified as rostral; their distinctive form rules out other parts of the skull or skeleton (Fig. 2). One thin piece of
55
280 right maxilla (Fig. 2: i) preserves a sulcus ventrally, interpreted as the sulcus for the superior alveolar artery

2
3 281 (sensu [21]). The sulcus is long (preserved length: 41 mm; width: 4 mm), shallow, slightly widening, and then
4 282 disappearing anteriorly; the orientation is uncertain, but is likely slightly anteromedially as seen in some extant
5
283 Plicoguli. Of three other pieces of presumed maxilla in Fig. 2, ii and iii belong to the right while iv belongs to
6
7 284 the left. In all, the medial margins are grooved and dorsoventrally thickened medially, consistent with a mobile
8 285 suture for the premaxilla. The cross-sections of Fig. 2 pieces i and ii are triangular, thick medially and thin
9
286 laterally, consistent with the broad and thin rostrum as seen in extant Plicoguli.
10
11 287 Four pieces of presumed premaxilla (Fig. 2, v–vii) are from the right, whereas viii belongs to the left.
12 288 The medial margin of piece v has a flat and smooth vertical surface, suggesting attachment with the nasal. The
13
14 289 medial margin of piece vi is twisted from posteriorly (facing medially) to anteriorly (facing dorsomedially),
15 290 suggesting a position at the nares, anterior to the anterior tip of the nasal. The dorsal margins of piece vii and
16 291 viii show broad and flat surfaces, suggesting anterior broadening parts of the premaxilla.
17
18 292 The left facial complex includes nasal, premaxilla, and maxilla. Some details are obscured by limonitic
19 293 matrix. Here, the slightly eroded posterior margins of both maxilla and premaxilla are slightly anterior to the
20 294 posterior margin of the nasal. The gentle outwards curvature of the premaxilla, anterior to the nasal, marks the
21
22 295 external narial fossa as seen in dorsal view. The ascending process of the premaxilla, posterior to the narial fossa,
23 296 is long, slender, and rectangular. The posterior margin of the maxilla, though damaged, indicates a short and
24 297 triangular ascending process of the maxilla. One large sub-oval dorsal infraorbital foramen opens slightly
25
26 298 posterior to the external narial fossa.
27 299 The incomplete antorbital notch on the maxilla has a broad groove, presumably for the facial nerve,
28
300 oriented posterolaterally towards the anterolateral margin of the supraorbital process of the frontal. Here the
29
30 301 lateral margin of the antorbital process is slightly eroded; the original margin external to the antorbital process
31 302 of the maxilla below the antorbital notch is thin.
32
303
33
34 304 Mandible (Fig. 5). Both mandibles lack surface detail dorsomedially, presumably the result of bioturbation
35 305 when exposed on the sea floor; lateral faces are better-preserved. The anterior symphyseal surface, mandibular
36
37
306 condyle, angular process, pan-bone, and mandibular foramen are lost. The better-preserved right mandible has
38 307 two complementary but not closely adjoining pieces: the body (710 mm long) and the region of the coronoid
39 308 process (377 mm long). Each mandible is slightly laterally and dorsally bowed, interpreted as natural curvature
40
41 309 rather than postmortem distortion. The cross section is compressed oval anteriorly, but with the ventral part
42 310 more rounded and dorsal compressed in mid-length, giving an inverted comma-shaped cross section. A chunk of
43 311 the apical lateral face of the left symphyseal region has a large, forward-facing, dorsal foramen, but whether a
44
45 312 mental foramen or an alveolus is uncertain. The dorsal crest is preserved anteriorly for about 150 mm on the
46 313 right mandible, with no large alveoli as seen in some eomysticetids, no alveolar groove, and no gingival
47 314 foramina. The mental foramina are long, deep, and oval, opening forward into sulci (Fig. 5b). On the right, 100
48
49 315 mm of coronoid crest is preserved before about 37 mm of broken margin for the possibly triangular coronoid
50 316 process; the gradually sloping coronoid crest, and steeper posterior margin, suggest that little is lost from the
51
317 coronoid process. The medial wall of the right mandibular canal is deep and broadly concave, but its overall
52
53 318 profile is uncertain. The dorsal margin of the mandibular fossa, ventral to the coronoid process, is thick and
54 319 robust. Laterally and more ventrally, bone thins to <3 mm toward the now-lost panbone. Ventrally, the rounded
55
320 profile lacks an insertion for gular muscles or the mylohyoid groove. Medially, the right mandible shows a fine

3 321 groove for Meckel’s cartilage, running 280 mm from mid-depth anteriorly, to the ventral surface posteriorly.
4 322
5
323 Periotic, left (Figs. 6–7). The anterior process is broadly triangular in medial view and tapering towards the
6
7 324 anterior keel in dorsal view. The anterior keel is slightly convex anteriorly and runs vertically from the
8 325 anterodorsal to the anteroventral angle. The medial surface of the anterior process is irregularly fissured and
9
326 perforated, while the lateral surface is smooth to finely perforated, with a prominent foramen or pit roughly at
10
11 327 the level of the anteroventral angle. The anteroexternal sulcus is a shallow groove, curving anteriorly from the
12 328 lateral tuberosity up to the anterodorsal angle. One anteroexternal foramen is present anterodorsal to the lateral
13
14 329 tuberosity. The lateral tuberosity is poorly developed, blunt, and bulbous; when articulated, it does not project
15 330 into the adjacent squamosal.
16 331 The fovea epitubaria is long with a marked depression posteriorly; there is no pedicle plate and/or
17
18 332 accessory ossicle attached. The ventral margin of the anterior process is slightly ventral to the level of the
19 333 ventral margin of the pars cochlearis. The mallear fossa is concave with well-defined margins. The inner margin
20 334 of the mallear fossa overhangs the facial sulcus and a fissure originating at the distal opening of the facial canal,
21
22 335 passing posteroventrally to the facial crest. A gentle depression, lateral to the start of facial crest and posterior to
23 336 the mallear fossa, may be the fossa incudis. Adjacent, the epitympanic hiatus for receiving the spiny process is
24 337 dorsal to the posterolateral flange.
25
26 338 The distal opening of the facial canal opens roughly at the same level as the anterior margin of the
27 339 fenestra ovalis, with the facial sulcus separated from the fenestra ovalis by a narrow crest. The fenestra ovalis is
28
340 oval to slightly elliptical, with a long anteroposterior diameter. Posterior to the fenestra ovalis, the facial sulcus
29
30 341 runs posteroventrally onto the base of the posterior process of the periotic; the posterior process of the tympanic
31 342 bulla is not fused to the periotic, is missing. The pitted fossa for the stapedial muscle, posterior to the fenestra
32
343 ovalis and onto the base of the posterior process, is slightly irregular to hemispherical and large. The facial crest
33
34 344 forms part of the ventral surface of the fossa for the stapedial muscle; the medial edge of the facial crest is
35 345 slightly eroded and damaged.
36
37
346 The anterior surface of the pars cochlearis gradually grades onto the medial surface of the anterior
38 347 process. The anterior incisure, which marks the anterior limit of the pars cochlearis, slightly curves up to the
39 348 anterodorsal angle. A small and rectangular foramen, posterior to the anterior incisure and at the level of the
40
41 349 aperture for the cochlear aqueduct, may be the hiatus Fallopii. The posterodorsal margin of the internal acoustic
42 350 meatus is slightly elongated dorsally. The proximal opening of the facial canal, the dorsal vestibular area, and
43 351 the aperture for the cochlear aqueduct, are roughly in line. The proximal opening of the facial canal is elliptical,
44
45 352 the dorsal vestibular area slightly irregular to elliptical, and the aperture for the cochlear aqueduct rounded; the
46 353 transverse crest of the internal acoustic meatus is well below the dorsal margin of the internal acoustic meatus.
47 354 The size of the dorsal vestibular area is more than twice of that of the proximal opening of the facial canal. The
48
49 355 foramen singulare in the dorsal vestibular area is large about half size of the dorsal vestibular area, and rounded
50 356 to elliptical; the spiral cribriform tract and the area cribrosa media are distinct and both are rounded; the area
51
357 cribrosa media is perforated ventrally.
52
53 358 The apertures for the vestibular aqueduct and cochlear aqueduct, and the fenestra rotunda, lie roughly
54 359 in a transverse line. The aperture for the cochlear aqueduct on the posteromedial corner of the pars cochlearis is
55
360 rounded and smaller than the aperture for the vestibular aqueduct. The aperture for the vestibular aqueduct is

2
3 361 slit-like and oriented anteromedially. A long fissure connects the aperture for the cochlear aqueduct and the
4 362 fenestra rotunda is present. Ventrally, the fenestra rotunda is irregular to rounded and slightly larger than the
5
363 fenestra ovalis, and opens at the posteromedial corner of the pars cochlearis. The caudal tympanic process is
6
7 364 transversely thin, extending slightly posteriorly, and broken posteroventrally. The median promontorial groove,
8 365 anterior to the fenestra rotunda, runs horizontally, reaches anteriorly to the level of the anterior margin of the
9
366 pars cochlearis, and is deeply excavated. The ventral surface of the pars cochlearis, anterior to the fenestra
10
11 367 rotunda and medial to the fenestra ovalis, is rounded.
12 368 The junction of the body and pars cochlearis, as seen in dorsal view, is irregularly perforated and
13
14 369 deeply excavated. The superior process is prominent and concave between the anterodorsal angle and dorsal
15 370 edge of the posteroexternal sulcus; the superior process is slightly lower than the dorsal elongation of the
16 371 posterodorsal margin of the pars cochlearis. The deep suprameatal fossa is bounded between the superior
17
18 372 process laterally and dorsally elongated lateral margins of the internal acoustic meatus medially. The medial
19 373 posterior sulcus, posterior to the suprameatal area and posterolateral to the aperture for the vestibular aqueduct,
20 374 is small and lunate. The posterior periotic crest is robust, separating the medial posterior sulcus and the
21
22 375 posteroexternal sulcus. The posteroexternal sulcus, posterior to the medial posterior sulcus, carries the
23 376 posteroexternal foramen roughly at the level of one-third the dorsoventral height of the periotic; the
24 377 posteroexternal sulcus runs down onto the lateral surface of the posterior process.
25
26 378 The posterior process is slightly cylindrical and becomes transversely thin distally; the height of the
27 379 base of the posterior process is about one-third of the dorsoventral height of the periotic; the posterior process is
28
380 oriented posterolaterally. The ventral surface for the posterior process of the tympanic bulla is smooth
29
30 381 proximally and slightly ridged distally. On the posterior surface of the pars cochlearis, the stylomastoid fossa is
31 382 deeply excavated on the lateral half, and forms a prominent depression on the dorsomedial surface of the
32
383 posterior process.
33
34 384
35 385 Tympanic Bulla (Figs. 8–9). The posterior process of the left bulla is missing. Its general profile is broadly
36
37
386 rectangular in dorsal view with its anterior tip slightly protruded. The Eustachian outlet is directed
38 387 anteromedially. There is no transverse ridge across the tympanic cavity. The smooth outer lip is slightly inflated
39 388 anterolaterally, covering most of the tympanic cavity in dorsal view. The anterodorsal crest on the outer lip
40
41 389 ascends smoothly from the apex of the bulla to the level of the dorsal origin of the lateral furrow. There is a step
42 390 laterally from the anterodorsal crest to the sulcus for the chorda tympani. The sulcus for the chorda tympani lies
43 391 along the dorsal edge of the outer lip and medial to the lateral furrow. A small ridge separates the latter sulcus
44
45 392 from the remnants of the groove for the anterior process of the malleus. A lateral furrow is just anterior to the
46 393 mid-length of the bulla. The mallear ridge, posterodorsal to the dorsal origin of the lateral furrow, is slightly
47 394 bulbous and indistinct.
48
49 395 The sigmoid process, posterior to the mid-length of the bulla, projects dorsally and is roughly
50 396 perpendicular to the main axis of the bulla; the dorsal margin is a rounded triangle in posterior view. The
51
397 sigmoid cleft curves anteriorly slightly forward of the anterior face of the sigmoid process, curving more
52
53 398 strongly (about 45 degrees) and deeper than in †Horopeta and †Whakakai.
54 399 The sigmoidal cavity, on the posterior face of the sigmoid process, is broadly oval and marks the
55
400 anterior limit of the tympanic sulcus. The tympanic sulcus arises on the posterior surface of the sigmoid process,

3 401 and runs along the base of the conical process toward the outer posterior pedicle. The conical process is gently
4 402 elevated with a triangular apex (medial and lateral views, Figs. 8b, 9a); the anterior half and the apex of the
5
403 conical process are roofed by the sigmoid process, and the medial margin of the conical process is roughly at the
6
7 404 same level medially as the apex of the sigmoid process in posterior view.
8 405 The prominential ridge is indistinct and descends lateroventrally to the level of the interprominential
9
406 ridge. The outer posterior pedicle, medial to the prominential ridge, is broken, and judging from the remaining
10
11 407 base, it is thinner and more delicate than the inner posterior pedicle.
12 408 There is no interprominential notch (dorsal view, Fig. 5.8a), or distinctly projecting prominences, so
13
14 409 that the posterior profile is oblique to rounded and not bilobed. The outer posterior prominence lies slightly
15 410 more posterior than the inner posterior prominence. In posterior view, the outer and inner posterior prominences
16 411 are roughly equal size. The elliptical foramen is wide, deep, slightly oval, and oriented ventrolaterally. The
17
18 412 interprominential ridge is medioventrally oriented and reaches the posteromedial corner to merge with the
19 413 involucral ridge medially. The median furrow is a broad and shallow groove, ventral to the interprominential
20 414 ridge on the ventral surface of the bulla, and extends forward to the level of the conical process. The anterior
21
22 415 half of the ventral surface of the bulla is pitted, smooth, and broadly flattened.
23 416 The domed posterodorsal surface of the involucrum passes forward via a slight step on the dorsal
24 417 surface to the flatter anterior surface. The broken base of the inner posterior pedicle sits posteriorly on the dome.
25
26 418 The surface of the involucrum is smooth, with fine transverse creases on the posterior half. The involucral ridge
27 419 is diffuse and faintly passes forward to the anteriormost point of the bulla; this ridge probably marks the
28
420 insertion for the connective tissue along the basioccipital crest.
29
30 421
31 422 Atlas (Fig. 10). The atlas is broadly rounded in anterior view, with a acutely pointed dorsal neural spine and
32
423 deep transverse processes; the articular facets for the occipital condyles and the axis are smooth, not pitted as
33
34 424 seen in young Balaenoptera bonaerensis. Each condyloid facet is roughly hemispherical and gently concave;
35 425 ventrally the left and right condyloid facets are confluent. The base of each transverse process is high, robust,
36
37
426 projecting dorsolaterally, and about half the height of the body, roughly from the level of the transverse foramen
38 427 to the ventral margin of the neural canal. The oval transverse foramen opens at the anterior half of the robust
39 428 neural arch. The neural spine is short and roughly posterior to the anteroposterior midline of the neural arch. The
40
41 429 anterior part of the neural spine of the axis articulates with the neural arch of the atlas just posterior to the neural
42 430 spine of the atlas. The articular facets for the axis are slightly convex and broadly U-shaped, with a confluent
43 431 ventral margin. The hypapophysis is indistinct at the posterior part of the ventral surface. The neural canal-fovea
44
45 432 dentis (odontoid fovea) is roughly 8-shaped, separated by bilateral ridges for the transverse ligament. The fovea
46 433 dentis is broadly U-shaped to rounded, and slightly smaller than the neural canal. The anterior width of the atlas
47 434 across the eroded crests of condyloid facets (articular surfaces) is estimated as 118 mm, substantially wider than
48
49 435 occipital condyle breadth of 93.0 mm.
50 436
51
437 Axis (Fig. 10). The axis is broadly triangular in anterior view, with most of both transverse processes missing.
52
53 438 The odontoid process is broadly rounded, slightly elevated from the body. The margins of the vertically-creased
54 439 posterior epiphysis have a closed suture with the body. The base of the transverse process is transversely robust
55
440 and well developed dorsoventrally, more than half height of the body. Judging from the remaining base of the

2
3 441 right transverse process, the transverse process projects posterolaterally. There is no indication of the
4 442 vertebrarterial canal or perforating foramen on the transverse process. The neural arch is robust, with a strong
5
443 overhanging postzygapophysis, on which the articular surface is roughly rectangular and facing almost ventrally.
6
7 444 The robust neural spine projects anteriorly, almost level with the odontoid process, to articulate with the
8 445 posterodorsal surface of the neural arch of the atlas. The posterior tip of the neural arch and the
9
446 postzygapophysis both project beyond the posterior surface of the body. The dorsal margin of the neural arch
10
11 447 descends gradually anteriorly. The neural canal is broadly rounded.
12 448
13
14 449 Ribs. Three relatively complete right ribs are of uncertain order and arrangement. Maximum preserved chord
15 450 length is 293 mm. Two ribs preserve the proximal parts, showing some curvature; one is anteroposteriorly thin
16 451 (10.4 mm), and presumably more anterior, while the other is thicker (21 mm), and more posterior.
17
18 452
19 453 Forelimb. Both forelimbs include the scapulae, and parts of both radii; the humerus and ulna are missing. Each
20 454 scapula is broadly fan-shaped with an anteroposterior length longer than dorsoventral height, and transversely
21
22 455 thin. The robust base of the acromion process (right) projects slightly anteroventrally; the distal part is missing.
23 456 The remnant base of the coracoid process is much smaller than the acromion process. The supraspinous fossa is
24 457 broadly grooved along the anterolateral margin of the scapula down to the level of the ventral margin of the
25
26 458 acromion process. The glenoid cavity is broadly oval and shallow. The subscapular ridge is broadly and slightly
27 459 elevated on the medial surface. The anterior and posterior margins descend down to the glenoid cavity, roughly
28
460 forming a right angle. The radius (not figured) is transversely flattened, broadly oval in cross section, and
29
30 461 slightly curving. The distal surface of the right radius is broken.

463 Phylogenetic placement of †Toipahautea waitaki. An equal weights analysis produced 920 equally parsimonious
33
34 464 trees with a tree length of 1283 (strict consensus tree: Fig. 11a). An implied weights analysis (k = 3) produced
35 465 three equally parsimonious trees with a tree length of 117.438 (strict consensus tree: Fig. 11b). Full phylogenies
36
37
466 with terminal taxa are in the Supplementary file. Under equal weights (Fig. 11a), †Toipahautea is one branch of
38 467 a polytomy that includes unresolved relationships amongst crown Mysticeti, †Horopeta, †Whakakai, and
39 468 undescribed OU 22224. In the implied weight analysis (Fig. 11b), †Toipahautea is part of a ladder-like
40
41 469 sequence between Eomysticetidae and crown Mysticeti; †Whakakai, †Horopeta, †Mauicetus and undescribed
42 470 †Mauicetus-like ZMT 67 are also in this ladder-like sequence.

47 474 5.1 †Toipahautea waitaki: the oldest crown Mysticeti?
48
49 475
50 476 †Toipahautea waitaki, †Whakakai waipata, and †Horopeta umarere are all known from single specimens from
51
477 the Kokoamu Greensand of the Waitaki region, and all are interpreted as Late Oligocene baleen-bearing archaic
52
53 478 mysticetes. †Toipahautea waitaki is the oldest, from low in the Greensand and in the upper Whaingaroan local
54 479 stage (basal Chattian, about 27.5 Ma). †Whakakai waipata is a little younger, from a distinctive brachiopod-
55
480 pectinid rich shellbed at about the base of the Duntroonian Stage (no more than 27.3 Ma), while †Horopeta

3 481 umarere is higher, but far below the top of the Duntroonian (at 25.2 Ma). Further, 3 species form a succession at
4 482 the same Hakataramea locality: †Toipahautea waitaki (oldest), †Horopeta umarere, and †Mauicetus parki
5
483 (youngest, about 24.7 Ma; see below). †Whakakai waipata is from elsewhere, near Duntroon.
6
7 484 All the type-specimens of †T. waitaki, †W. waipata, and †H. umarere include character-rich
8 485 tympanoperiotic complexes, in which phylogenetically revealing features are present early in ontogeny,
9
486 supplementing the incomplete skulls. Phylogenetic analyses show the three species as more-crownward than the
10
11 487 clade †Eomysticetidae, but of uncertain relation to the crown-Mysticeti, and included or excluded from the
12 488 crown group depending on analytical settings [7,13].
13
14 489 According to the original definition of a crown group [22], the crown Mysticeti will include the most
15 490 recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the six extant genera of baleen whales (Balaena, Balaenoptera, Caperea,
16 491 Eschrichtius, Eubalaena, and Megaptera) and all the descendants of the MRCA. †Eomysticetidae has
17
18 492 consistently been identified as the sister clade to the crown Mysticeti, as in Fig. 11 (also see e.g. [2,3,16]), and is
19 493 one of several stem mysticete clades commonly placed between the crown Mysticeti and the †Archaeoceti,
20 494 including: †Aetiocetidae, †Mammalodontidae, †Llanocetidae and some Charleston mysticetes, such as
21
22 495 †Coronodon. Three recently named genera, in this fast-moving field of paleocetology, are not included in our
23 496 analyses, but were placed phylogenetically in the original articles as more-basal to †Toipahautea. The presumed
24 497 baleen-bearing †Sitsqwayk cornishorum is probably Chattian, and phylogenetically between †Eomysticetidae
25
26 498 and †Aetiocetidae [23]. The toothed Rupelian †Coronodon havensteini [3] is basal to †Aetiocetidae and one of
27 499 the most basal Mysticeti, while the toothed Priabonian †Mystacodon selenensis [4] is reportedly the most basal
28
500 mysticete.
29
30 501 In both phylogenetic analyses of Fig. 11, †Toipahautea is crownward of †Eomysticetidae, either in a
31 502 polytomy with crown Mysticeti, or just below the crown. Hitherto, the oldest described fossil baleen whale close
32
503 to or within crown Mysticeti is †Horopeta (25–27 Ma), for which position varies depending on phylogenetic
33
34 504 analyses (e.g. Tsai & Fordyce [7], fig. 14a: crown Mysticeti; 14b: stem mysticete). Consider also †Mauicetus
35 505 parki (about 24.7 Ma based on Sr/Sr isotopes), from the middle Otekaike Limestone at the †Toipahautea and
36
37
506 †Horopeta type locality. †M. parki has been proposed as an early balaenopteroid within the crown Mysticeti
38 507 (see [16]). Our results in Fig. 11a also show †Mauicetus as a crown Mysticeti, but †Mauicetus is excluded from
39 508 the crown Mysticeti in the alternative analysis of Fig. 11b. Inconsistent positions for taxa in a phylogeny reflect
40
41 509 widely recognised factors including the number of individuals sampled, preservation, ontogenetic stage,
42 510 character linkage, and uncertain homology (discussed by Tsai & Fordyce [13]). It is also difficult to recognise
43 511 true ancestry (see [10] on ancestry in a cladistic framework). Of note, because the holotype of †T. waitaki is a
44
45 512 physically immature individual, its (current) phylogenetic position would probably move more-crownward if an
46 513 adult individual were available to code. Elsewhere, we discussed the relationships between ontogeny and
47 514 phylogeny in Mysticeti [24]. We suggest that, on balance, the relationships and ages of species of †Toipahautea,
48
49 515 †Horopeta, †Whakakai, and †Mauicetus indicate that the MRCA of crown Mysticeti lived about the early-late
50 516 Oligocene boundary or even in the early Oligocene.

2
3 521 laterally extensive maxilla, indicate the presence of baleen in †Toipahautea. (Ekdale et al [21] discussed the
4 522 osteological correlate for the presence of baleen). In addition, the edentulous mandible of †Toipahautea is
5
523 laterally and dorsoventrally bowed, and its coronoid process is well-developed, and slightly laterally deflected,
6
7 524 consistent with the condition in toothless Mysticeti. We interpret the 27.5 Ma †Toipahautea as a baleen-bearing
8 525 toothless mysticete, contrasting with the baleen-bearing †Eomysticetidae with remnant teeth.
9
526 Total loss of teeth in adults, and acquisition of baleen, are two independent major evolutionary events
10
11 527 in mysticete evolution; they are regulated by different genes (e.g. [25,26]), probably allowing independent
12 528 evolutionary results. Total tooth loss would involve multiple genes [27]. The fossil record is too patchy to say
13
14 529 whether the evolutionary rate of tooth loss in Mysticeti was gradual or abrupt.
15 530 Two mainly Late Oligocene groups, †Aetiocetidae and †Eomysticetidae, had both teeth and baleen, but
16 531 they represent quite different grades, or ecomorphs. †Aetiocetidae had well-developed teeth, but baleen is
17
18 532 questionable (see [5,6,9]). Aetiocetids show evolutionary trends of tooth simplification from heterodonty to
19 533 homodonty, and some increase in tooth number (polydonty in †Aetiocetus polydentatus), but no indication of
20 534 tooth loss. Conversely, †Eomysticetidae was nearly toothless with probably well-developed baleen racks in at
21
22 535 least the posterior two thirds of the rostrum [1,28].
23 536 The 27.5 Ma †Toipahautea, and the slightly younger †Horopeta and †Mauicetus, are clearly distinct
24 537 from the coeval †Aetiocetidae and †Eomysticetidae in terms of feeding apparatus, suggesting that the genetic
25
26 538 sequence regulating tooth development had already actioned the total loss of dentition in adulthood. Another
27 539 suite of genes independently led to the presence of fully functional baleen racks by the end of the Early
28
540 Oligocene, concurrent with toothlessness.
29
30 541 †Toipahautea, †Aetiocetidae, and †Eomysticetidae are coeval and morphologically disparate, without
31 542 clear ancestor-descendant relationships. Aetiocetids and eomysticetids were speciose in the stem-Mysticeti that
32
543 likely originated in the Early Oligocene, went extinct by the earliest Miocene, and then represented short-lived
33
34 544 clades, when mysticetes explored niche possibility and underwent morpho-ecological experimentation, without
35 545 giving rise to the crown of Mysticeti. Aetiocetids and eomysticetids are interesting side-branches and
36
37
546 evolutionary dead ends in mysticete evolution, distinct from the origin of crown Mysticeti, but informative to
38 547 show the morphological potential to bridge the transition between toothed and baleen-bearing forms. Thus, it
39 548 largely remains uncertain where the true baleen-bearing mysticetes arose from toothed forms because currently
40
41 549 known stem mysticetes, which could be ancestral/transitional species, such as †mystacodontids, †llanocetids,
42 550 †mammalodontids, †aetiocetids, †Coronodon and †eomysticetids, show such morphological disparities as well
43 551 as the temporal overlap to some extent, that seem to exclude the possibility of ancestor-descendant relationships
44
45 552 leading to early toothless and baleen-bearing †Toipahautea, and for now, †Toipahautea may serve as a best
46 553 calibration point to consider the emergence of fully baleen-bearing and toothless mysticete, or specifically the
47 554 origin of crown Mysticeti.
48
49 555
50 556 5.3 Feeding mode in early Mysticeti
51
557
52
53 558 Coeval Oligocene mysticetes had diverse feeding behaviours, perhaps the greatest in mysticete history, in terms
54 559 of: rostral form and kinesis; the presence (or loss), form and size of teeth; and development of baleen as
55
560 indicated from rostral vascular sulci and possible jaw mechanics. The inferred feeding behaviours fall into these

2
3 561 groups:
4 562 1), †Toipahautea, perhaps with proto-baleen and a long kinetic jaw and skull, shows a laterally curved coronoid
5
563 process, suggesting that it may gulp-feed like †Horopeta (discussed by Tsai and Fordyce [7]).
6
7 564 2), Eomysticetids, with baleen and remnant teeth in long kinetic jaws, likely used another style of bulk filtering
8 565 – skim feeding [29].
9
566 3), Aetiocetids, with functional teeth in long akinetic jaws, were probably raptorial, with primitive bulk-filtering
10
11 567 capability [9] and/or suction feeding [5,6].
12 568 4), The toothed mysticete †Janjucetus, with functional teeth in short akinetic jaws, was likely raptorial [30].
13
14 569 5), The toothed mysticete †Mammalodon, with functional teeth in short kinetic jaws, was likely a bottom
15 570 suction-feeder [31].
16 571 6), The toothed mysticete †Coronodon, with functional teeth in long akinetic jaws, was likely filter feeding with
17
18 572 help of teeth instead of baleen [3], but also see the interpretation from [32].
19 573 Three scenarios have been proposed for the evolution of mysticete feeding from toothed to baleen-
20 574 bearing: raptorial with proto-baleen to facilitate a primitive filtering-assisted style [9], raptorial with suction-
21
22 575 assisted [5,6], and filter feeding starting with teeth instead of baleen [3]. Given that the ancestor-descendant
23 576 relationships from toothed to baleen remain unknown and based on highly disparate morphologies of coeval
24 577 toothed mysticetes, such as †Coronodon, †Mammalodon, †Janjucetus, and speciose aetiocetids from
25
26 578 †Toipahautea, it may be primitive to confirm which feeding mode was mainly employed while mysticetes
27 579 experienced the presence of both teeth and baleen and then subsequently transitioned from toothed to baleen-
28
580 assisted feeding. However, consider that 1), adoptability of various feeding strategies in the Oligocene
29
30 581 mysticetes (possible gulp-feeding †Horopeta and †Toipahautea, skim-feeding eomysticetids, raptorial
31 582 †Janjucetus, suction-feeding †Mammalodon, raptorial with possible primitive filter-feeding †aetiocetids, and
32
583 possible tooth-assisted filter-feeding †Coronodon) and 2), versatility of feeding strategy in extant mysticetes;
33
34 584 for example, the gray whale Eschrichtius robustus can also perform gulp and skim feeding while they are
35 585 mainly suction-feeders at the sea bottom [33] or ability to learn new feeding skills in balaenopterids [34].
36
37
586 Perhaps early mysticetes were like the gray whale or speciose balaenopterids and versatile in feeding strategies.
38 587 We, here, propose that mysticetes were generalists and opportunists instead of specializing in any
39 588 particular forms of feeding strategies as they transitioned from toothed ancestry possibly specializing in raptorial
40
41 589 to baleen-bearing, like †Toipahautea, perhaps performing bulk-feeding, but not precluding the possibility of
42 590 adopting new skills or approaches at feeding as seen in extant gray whales and balaenopterids. This scenario
43 591 may help early mysticetes to avoid high ecological competition as they evolved from specialists (raptorial
44
45 592 toothed forms) to generalists (transitional period), and then subsequently some lineages acquired their new
46 593 niches to specialize in particular feeding strategies, such as skim feeding in balaenids and gulp feeding in
47 594 balaenopteroids. This specialist-generalist-specialist hypothesis in mysticete evolution explains a possible
48
49 595 awkward stage as mysticetes had both teeth and baleen during feeding. With the flexibility and versatility in
50 596 food and feeding strategy, they enhanced the survival rate and then some lineages successfully gave rise to the
51
597 largest animals to have ever appeared in the history of life as we observe today.

Appendix C
Dear Editor,
Thank you for your positive decision on our manuscript. We also thank the reviewers for
their helpful and constructive comments. We have provided detailed replies to all of the
points they raised below and the updated manuscript with track changes in places.
Kind regards,
Tsai, C.-H and Fordyce, R. Ewan
Comments by the editor
Both reviewers are supportive of the taxonomic conclusions in the manuscript and offer
useful and detailed comments. One reviewer suggested careful proofreading of the
introduction and discussion to improve clarity which is a suggestion that I agree with. As an
example, on line 44, the sentence "when and how mysticetes became obligate baleen-feeders
is moot" is confusing to me especially because you do spend a fair amount of time discussing
how mysticetes might have become baleen feeders. The taxonomic descriptions on the other
hand are clear and detailed.
We have re-worded in places (see track changes in the updated manuscript) to improve the
clarity and readability.
Reviewer 1
1) l. 23 and l. 166-167: the coronoid process is also curved laterally in eomysticetids. This is
particularly evident in Yamatocetus. See photo of the right mandible below.
We also included the morphological description here for comparison (triangular or rounded),
not only describing the curvature (curved laterally). For example, the coronoid process is
tapered in Toipahautea (Line 23), but it is broadly rounded in Yamatocetus or other
eomysticetids.
2) l. 108: rather than, or in addition to, simple scaling with Horopeta, total body length could
be estimated based on the equation of Pyenson et al. (2013)
The equation of Pyenson et al 2013 is based on the length of mandible, but the mandible of
Toipahautea is incomplete, so that other comparisons are needed. Simple scaling with the
also-incomplete Horopeta may be followed easily.
3) l. 169-170: “the profile of tympanic bulla more rounded instead of dorsoventrally
compressed”; in what view?
We have indicated it in the text: “in medial view” (Line 171).
4) l. 171-172: I thought Horopeta showed at least a certain degree of lateral deflection of the
mandible? There are statements to that effect in Tsai and Fordyce (2015), e.g. “coronoid
process of mandible deflected posterolaterally”. Maybe the coronoid is *more* curved in
Toipahautea than in Horopeta? Please clarify.
Yes, Horopeta shows deflection, but strictly it is posterolateral deflection, which is different
from the more-lateral orientation in Toipahautea.
5) l. 204: for clarity, it might be useful here to cite the discussion of the posterior sinus/
stylohyal articulation in Marx and Fordyce (2016) .
We have added Marx and Fordyce 2016 here for a reference.
6) l. 217: what is the “body” of the squamosal?
This is a typo. The “body” was deleted.
7) l. 340: in this context, what is the difference between “oval” and “elliptical”?
For clarity, the “oval” was deleted in this sentence.
8) l. 380: do you mean “periotic” instead of “tympanic bulla”?
We have corrected this typo to be “periotic”.
9) l. 460: why is the radius not figured? I think an additional photo here would be a good
idea.
We considered this originally, but the radius is broken with few informative surfaces, and we
felt that the description should suffice.
10) l. 527 and 537–539: Thewissen et al. (2017) suggest that some of the developmental
signalling (and thus likely genetic control) normally responsible for tooth formation has
become involved in baleen ontogeny
We have cited Thewissen et al 2017 for an alternative interpretation.
11) l. 530: “†Aetiocetidae and †Eomysticetidae, had both teeth and baleen”; maybe better:
“may have had both teeth and baleen”
Done.
12) l. 556-597: Feeding mode in early Mysticeti. This section summarises recent discussions
on the origin of baleen and filter feeding, and suggests that most or all Oligocene mysticetes
were effectively versatile generalists that could employ a variety of strategies depending on
the feeding scenario. I broadly agree with this interpretation, but there are some points that I
think need to be taken into consideration.
First, I am not entirely sure how this section follows on from the remainder of the paper.
Toipahautea appears to be the oldest chaeomysticete with baleen and no teeth. As such, it
constrains the time when modern mysticete filter feeding arose; it does not, however, offer
new data on how the tooth-baleen transition itself occurred. I think it would be beneficial to
clarify whether the discussion in this section is based on new data provided in the paper, or
whether it is merely a comment on previous research.
Secondly, as currently worded, this section seems to imply that earlier studies on the tooth-
baleen transition argued for specialisation. I don’t think is true. The idea that early mysticetes
were versatile in their feeding mode is not new. In fact, virtually *all* papers discussing the
tooth-baleen transition implicitly or explicitly acknowledge that more than one strategy must
have been at play. For example, Demere and Berta (2008) interpret aetiocetids as capable of
both raptorial and incipient filter feeding; Marx et al. (2016) suggest that mysticetes
transitioned from raptorial, to raptorial + suction, to suction + filtering; Hocking et al.
(2017b) specifically stress the versatility of individual species in their behavioural
framework; Hocking et al. (2017a) suggest a mix of raptorial and suction feeding for
Coronodon; and Geisler et al. (2017) make it clear that their dental filtration hypothesis does
not preclude suction. Rather than trying to argue for specialisation as such, previous studies
tried to delimit the *range* of strategies that were used by particular species. I think the
present paper needs to make this clear, and acknowledge that feeding versatility has always
been part of the debate.
Thirdly, I think it is maybe too simplistic to think of all Oligocene mysticetes as generalists
capable of using whatever feeding suited them at the time. For example, Yamatocetus
probably did not feed raptorially, and Mammalodon probably did not filter. As stated in the
paper, early mysticetes are notably disparate, ranging from bizarre forms like Mammalodon
all the way to Toipahautea. It seems almost inconceivable to me that such a degree of
morphological diversity is not at least in part driven by specialisation. Otherwise, why evolve
the marked differences between, say, mammalodontids and stem plicogulans in the first
place?
Finally, I am not convinced that using generalisation as a way to explain the tooth-baleen
transition is really that fruitful. At present, the manuscript seems to portray the term as a kind
of ‘black box’ into which raptorial feeder descend, and from which filter feeders emerge,
with no hint of how one changed into the other. This seems somewhat simplistic, and brings
with it the danger of making hypothesis on the tooth-baleen transition virtually untestable: if
all of the animals involved were always capable of everything, then no inference can ever be
refuted. I agree that the transition from raptorial to filter feeding likely was neither
straightforward nor particularly constrained (i.e. there presumably were plenty of side-
braches and dead ends). Nevertheless, at some point it had to follow some form of
evolutionary trajectory, which resulted in a measureable change in capabilities, morphology
and behaviour. Generalisation as a way to smooth the transition is certainly plausible, but can
go only so far. Even if some species at the heart of the transition were capable of several
strategies (I agree that this is rather likely), the frequency with which particular strategies
were employed, and the morphological and behavioural adaptations enabling them, would
have changed over time. Previous studies acknowledged feeding versatility, but also tried to
generate more specific hypotheses as to which species were capable of which strategies (or
range of strategies). Ultimately, this strikes me as a more useful approach, even though I of
course agree that we need to bear in mind how versatile, and sometimes random, evolution
can be.
We fully understand and appreciate reviewer’s concerns. We did not ignore the feeding versatility in
the manuscript. For example, we also mentioned that aetiocetids were probably raptorial with
primitive bulk-filtering capability or suction feeding (Line 571–572).
However, the new scheme that we propose here is to emphasise “how” early mysticetes could
smoothly transition from toothed to baleen-bearing forms at a possibly awkward evolutionary stage.
With descriptions and discoveries of new species, we now indeed know a wide spectrum of feeding
modes in Oligocene mysticetes, but it seems to us that it has no conflict with our specialist-generalist-
specialist hypothesis. It has been widely appreciated that species radiated to explore many ecological
possibilities with diverse morphologies at an early radiating stage. The issue is always that early
diverse species complicate the recognition of which lineage(s) gave rise to which descendants or led
to the extant species. This is also the reason why we emphasised in the manuscript that we really
need to pin down the ancestor-descendant relationships at this critical evolutionary stage. Then, this
specialist-generalist-specialist would also be testable.
Reviewer 2
This is a well-crafted, clearly presented and superbly illustrated description of an enigmatic
yet informative new species of early baleen whale from the Oligocene of New Zealand. I find
the conclusions reasonable based on the available evidence, and the anatomical and
phylogenetic evidence for this fossil being a new species quite convincing. I therefore
recommend publication after minor revision. I only have 20 trivial suggested corrections and
comments on the manuscript (see the annotated PDF attached.) The only other
recommendation I make to the authors is to check the contrast/brightness in the periotic
figures (Figs. 6 and 7): these look a bit too washed-out to me and could benefit from being
less bright.
Otherwise, this is good to go!
We have made changes according to suggested comments from the annotated PDF. In
addition, we also adjusted the contrast/brightness of Figs 6–9.
