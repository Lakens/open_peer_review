This manuscript describes the unexpected chlorination of 2-hydroxyethanol derivatives during
attempted tosylation. The authors provide a very detailed account of how they explored this
unexpected result, both with respect to exploring the reaction conditions on the substrate 2a (data
presented in Table 1) and also with alternative substrates (data presented in Table 2). The results
from all of these reactions are well documented and clearly the spectroscopic data obtained,
including X-ray data on two products, is supportive of the proposed chlorinated products being
formed under these unusually mild conditions. One minor comment here is that there is a lack of
mass spec data on these compounds - the presence of Cl would be clear in the mass spectra due
to the two natural isotopes of chlorine, so perhaps such data could be included.
Whilst it is clear that the chlorination of these 2-hydroxyethanol substrates does indeed occur, it
is perhaps a little less clear as to why. Firstly, the yields are always below 50%, which implies so
participation from the tosylated species is required. It would perhaps be worthwhile for the
authors to make some of the tosylated species, isolate and purify this compound (that would be
compound 3 in the manuscript), and then expose the purified tosylate to the reaction conditions
(TosCl/pyridine) and see if any chlorination results. I did not see this experiment described in
the manuscript itself, and such an experiment may shed light on the mechanism. Furthermore,
the authors comment that they used "four different lots of tosyl chloride", all giving the same
outcome. But they authors have not discussed if they specifically purified the tosyl chloride, or if
it was simply commercially obtained. It is well known that commercial tosyl chloride can contain
tosic acid and HCl - such material usually has a m.p. 65-68°C (Armarego & Chai, "Purification of
Laboratory Chemicals", 7th ed, p. 387). Crystallisation (from CHCl3/pet ether) results in material
with m.p. 67.5-68.5°C. Did the authors recrystallise any of their tosyl chloride - if not, I suggest
they repeat the reported reaction with purified tosyl chloride.
Overall, I think this is an interesting result that will be of interest to a number of synthetic
chemists, and so provided some minor additional experiments are undertaken (as suggested
above), I think the work should be published.

Dear Colleagues,
This manuscript describes the preparation of 2-chloroethyl piperazines from the respective
alcohols via treatment with tosyl chloride in pyridine. The article is enjoyable to read and the
experimental work is written in way that it is easy to follow and reproduce. The compounds are
well characterized and the physical data is well presented.
The reaction condition (TsCl/Py) employed for this synthetic study is typical for the preparation
of tosylated derivatives and the generation of alkyl chlorides is a well-known outcome associated
to primary alcohols and long reaction times. However, the piperazine ethanol substrate studied
on this work shows a particularly higher rate of alkyl chloride formation compared to other
substrates. The authors perform a study of the scope of this reaction using different piperazine
ethanol substrates, different conditions and an aryl ethanol compound as a control molecule. The
results point to the piperazine moiety as a key component for the observed high rate of alkyl
chloride formation.
I would like to point some aspects I found in the manuscript that needs to be revised:
1. In the introduction, it is stated that there are no previous reports related to the preparation of 2-
chloroethyl piperazines from the respective alcohol by this procedure (page 1, lines 34-37, 2nd
column: To the best of our knowledge, there are no records in the literature on the conversion of
piperazinyl ethanols into chlorides via a tosylation reaction.) However, in 2010 Sachin et al.
(Bioconjugate Chem. 2010, 21, 2282–2288) employed the system tosyl chloride/triethylamine for
transforming a 4-phenyl substituted piperazine ethanol into the respective 2-chloroethyl adduct
(see compound 11 in the above reference). This publication must be cited in the manuscript and
the introduction needs to be modified accordingly.
2. I would suggest including a discussion about a plausible mechanism for explaining the higher
rate of alkyl chloride formation that is observed for piperazine ethanol derivatives. The
neighboring tertiary amine from the piperazine ring can engage in the tosylate displacement
(anchimeric assistance).
3. The results observed for compound 2f shows the key role of the piperazine moiety in the
reaction rate. It would add to the quality of this work if the authors extend the study using a
piperazine derivative with a longer alkyl chain (propyl or butyl).
Typos:
4. Page 1, Line 34: antipsyhotic (antipsychotic)
5. Page 2, Line 7: 4a instead of 4a (bold font)
Overall, I think that this is a good synthetic article that will help other researchers in the design of
4
synthetic routes for the preparation of 2-substituted ethyl piperazine derivatives and other
similar compounds.
Hope you find my comments and suggestions appropriate and constructive,

ear Prof. Chávez,
hank you very much for the time you and the other associate editors have devoted to handle
ur submission. We are very grateful to you and Reviewers for the help permitting us to
mprove significantly the manuscript.
ll corrections in the manuscript, inserted according to the Reviewers’ recommendations, are
ighlighted in green. The end statements required are also included.
he Reviewer 1 suggested to isolate and purify tosylate and then to submit to a reaction with
osyl chloride. However, all attempts to isolate tosylate of a piperidine derivative were
nsuccessful; decomposition took place. The only relatively stable tosylate was 3f and so, we
erformed the reaction by taking regularly probes and analysing by proton NMR spectra (Table
, entries 5-9), which gives information on the consumption of initially formed tosylate with
he time. Concerning the purity of the reagent, we always use recrystallized tosyl chloride in
rder to eliminate HCl contamination. That time, we also performed experiments with non-
ecrystallized commercial lots, but received the same results.
aithfully yours,
