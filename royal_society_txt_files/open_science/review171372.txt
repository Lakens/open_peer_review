I have already reviewed this paper before for another journal and, apparently, the authors did not
follow any of my previous suggestions to improve the quality of the paper. My previous report
about that paper, that I maintain, was:
This paper describes a study about the degradation of Clofibric acid in UV/Chlorine disinfection
process. The main problem about this paper is the lack of novelty. Indeed, the photochemical
degradation of Clofibric acid in water (and coupled to other disinfection agents) is a relatively
well-studied subject. The first part of this paper should focus on the revision about this subject
and the following papers should be cited (among others):
- Water Sci Technol. 2009;60(11):2983-9. doi: 10.2166/wst.2009.690.

After that, the paper should focus on the most novelty aspects.
Moreover, all the experimental rate constants should be resumed in Tables and the corresponding
experimental error must be shown.

This study investigated the kinetics and pathways of CA degradation in UV/chlorine process.
Compared with UV photolysis, CA degradation was
greatly enhanced in UV/chlorine process, while CA could not be degraded by dark
chlorination.The degradation intermediates were monitored by
LC/MS/MS, and the proposed degradation pathways suggested that aryloxy-carbon cleavage,
aryl-halogen cleavage, and aryl ring substitution were the
main degradation pathways of CA in UV/chlorine process.The results are clear, but lack of
innovation, and the work seems not meaningful enough in the real application of CA
degradation. Moreover,the degradation pathway are still not definitive. So it is not suitable to
accept this manuscript.

Appendix A
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you very much for your letter and comments regarding our manuscript entitled
“Degradation of clofibric acid in UV/Chlorine process: Kinetics, reactive species
contribution and pathways” (RSOS-171372). Your comments of great value to us; they
not only helped improve the general quality of our paper, but provided significant
guidance for our research as well. We studied the comments carefully and tried our best
to revise the manuscript, which we hope could meet with your approval. Please find
the revised portions in red in our manuscript. The corresponding response to the
reviewers’ comments and the modifications as following:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s) :
This paper describes a study about the degradation of Clofibric acid in UV/Chlorine
disinfection process. The main problem about this paper is the lack of novelty. Indeed,
the photochemical degradation of Clofibric acid in water (and coupled to other
disinfection agents) is a relatively well-studied subject. The first part of this paper
should focus on the revision about this subject and the following papers should be cited
(among others):
- Water Sci Technol. 2009;60(11):2983-9. doi: 10.2166/wst.2009.690.
Photo-degradation of clofibric acid by ultraviolet light irradiation at 185 nm.

- Transformation Products of Synthetic Chemicals in the Environment, ed. Alistair
Boxall. The handbook of environmental chemistry, Volume 2, Part 2., 2009, Spinger.
After that, the paper should focus on the most novelty aspects.
Moreover, all the experimental rate constants should be resumed in Tables and the
corresponding experimental error must be shown.
Response to the reviewer 1:
Thanks for the valuable comment. According to the suggestion, the first part of this
paper has been carefully revised as Lines 38-72, and the references about UV photolysis
of CA such as (Water Sci. Technol. 2009, 60, 2983-2989 (recommended); Water Res.
2005, 39, 403-411) have been added as [9] and [10] in the revised manuscript.
After the revision of the first part, the novelty of this paper could be found as,
(i) Degradation Kinetics of CA in UV photolysis and UV/Chlorine process were
comparatively investigated;
(ii) The contributions of UV photolysis and reactive species to CA degradation in
UV/chlorine process were elucidated;
(iii) Different degradation products and pathways of CA in UV photolysis and
UV/chlorine process were obtained. Compared with UV photolysis, several
chlorinated-byproducts were found in UV/chlorine process, which should be paid more
attention in further application.
We sincerely accept your advice, the experimental rate constants were resumed in Table
1, and the corresponding experimental errors were also given in Table 1. In addition,
some figures (Figures 2, 6-8) have also been adjusted and redrawn.
Again, thanks for the help for improving our manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
This study investigated the kinetics and pathways of CA degradation in UV/chlorine
process. Compared with UV photolysis, CA degradation was greatly enhanced in
UV/chlorine process, while CA could not be degraded by dark chlorination.
The degradation intermediates were monitored by LC/MS/MS, and the proposed
degradation pathways suggested that aryloxy-carbon cleavage, aryl-halogen cleavage,
and aryl ring substitution were the main degradation pathways of CA in UV/chlorine
process.
The results are clear, but lack of innovation, and the work seems not meaningful enough
in the real application of CA degradation. Moreover, the degradation pathway are still
not definitive. So it is not suitable to accept this manuscript.
Response to the reviewer2: The implication of our paper could be found as the
following two aspects:
Firstly, this paper investigated the degradation kinetics of CA in UV/chlorine process,
the observed rate constants (kobs,CA) and half-lifes (t1/2) of CA degradation in
UV/chlorine process with different environmental contexts (dosage of chlorine, pH,
water matrix ) were obtained and shown in in Table 1. Those values could be used to
predict the CA behavior in the water treatment process, thus guiding the practical
application.
In addition, the degradation products of CA in UV photolysis and UV/chlorine process
were also comparatively studied in this paper. The results showed that primary
degradation products of CA UV photolysis process could be further oxidized into
chlorinated disinfection by-products(DBPs) in UV/chlorine process such as P6 and P13,
which may increase the bio-risk and toxicity of CA degradation products after the actual
water treatment.
Therefore, the work can be used to guide the UV/Chlorine process for CA degradation.
To better clarify this, the implication of this paper has been added in the revised
manuscript in Lines 340-341 and 344-349.
To improve the innovation, we have revised the first part as suggested by reviewer 1.
Then, the novelty of this paper could be found as,
(i) Degradation Kinetics of CA in UV photolysis and UV/Chlorine process were
comparatively investigated;
(ii) The contributions of UV photolysis and reactive species to CA degradation in
UV/chlorine process were elucidated;
(iii) Different degradation products and pathways of CA in UV photolysis and
UV/chlorine process were obtained. Compared with UV photolysis, several
chlorinated-byproducts were found in UV/chlorine process, which should be paid more
attention in further application.
To better eliminate the CA degradation pathway, we carefully revised the part 3.6 in the
Manuscript as following,
(i) We have re-analyzed the products by the HPLC GE-MS/MS total ion chromatogram
(Figure 9) and the list of degradation products (Table 2), and almost all of the products
were compared with the literatures, the evidences for the identification of these products
were added to lines 294-295.
(ii) The pathways of CA degradation were derived from the UV direct photolysis
process of CA (Water Res. 2005, 39, 403-411)and UV/chlorine process degradation
other PPCPs(Water Res.90,301-308; Environ Sci Technol.48,1859-1868;
Chemosphere.150,715-722 ). After consulting and adding those documents in lines
301-303, 312-314, three pathways(R1-R3) for CA degradation in UV/chlorine process
(solid lines) and two pathways (R1-R2) in UV photolysis process were clear in the
revised manuscript.
We must again offer our sincere thanks to your questions and advice. It is of great help
to us and we really appreciate your time. We also made some wording changes to
improve the manuscript, which will not influence the content or framework of the paper,
and these revises are marked in red in our manuscript. We hope the revised manuscript
will meet with your approval.
