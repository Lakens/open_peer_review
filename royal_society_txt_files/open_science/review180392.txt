Abstract
We report floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition synthesis of single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for high performance transparent conducting films
(TCFs) using low feeding rate of precursor solution. Herein, ethanol acts as carbon
source, ferrocene and thiophene as catalyst precursor and growth promoter,
respectively. By adopting a low feeding rate of 4 µl/min, the fabricated TCFs present
one of the lowest sheet resistances of ca. 78 ohm/sq. at 90% transmittance. Optical
characterizations demonstrate that the mean diameter of high quality SWCNTs is up
to 2 nm. Additionally, electron microcopy observations provide the evidences that the
mean length of SWCNT bundles is as long as 28.4 µm while the mean bundle
diameter is only 5.3 nm. Moreover, very few CNT loops can be found in the film.
Remarkably, the fraction of individual SWCNTs climbs up to 24.6%. All those
morphology data account for the superior optoelectronic performance of our SWCNT
TCFs.

1. Introduction
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have exceptional electrical and
unique optical properties, rendering them being applied in various application fields,
especially in transparent conducting films (TCFs) [1–4]. The fabrication methods of
SWCNT TCFs are dominated by solution method [1,3,5] and dry-transfer method
[2,6,7]. The dry-transfer method outperforms solution method in regard to retaining
the primordial features of SWCNTs, since as-produced SWCNTs are collected at the
outlet of a reactor using a membrane filter to form a thin film which can be
press-transferred to a target substrate. Additionally, features like diameter [8], length
[2] and bundle diameter [9] of SWCNTs can be controlled via adjusting growth
parameters.
Specific applications of SWCNTs require particular diameter of SWCNTs. For
instance, Asada et al. [10] have confirmed that the superiority of small diameter
SWCNTs for thin film transistor applications in terms of both on/off ratio and carrier
mobility. Theoretical and experimental studies indicate that the band gap of
semiconducting SWCNT (s-SWCNT) is inversely proportional to its diameter,
following the relationship of Eg~0.6 eV/d (nm) [11,12]. Therefore, large diameter
SWCNTs featured by narrow band gaps which induce excitation of a considerable
number of carriers are preferable in the application of conductive films [13]. Besides,
we have investigated the effect of mean bundle length of SWCNTs on the sheet
resistance of TCFs, concluding that TCFs consisting of long nanotube bundles exhibit
lower sheet resistances [2,9]. However, the mean bundle lengths of nanotubes in those
works are shorter than 10 µm, longer nanotubes are highly needed to verify the
finding. Another crucial factor affecting the conductivity of TCFs is the mean
diameter of SWCNT bundle. Utilizing conductance atomic force microscopy,
Nirmalraj et al. [14] studied junction resistances in SWCNT networks and found that
the junction between narrow nanotube bundles presents lower resistance. We also
reported SWCNT TCFs with a low sheet resistance of 63 ohm/sq. at 90%
transmittance via producing SWCNTs containing 60% individual ones [6]. In a
floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition reactor, as-formed nanotubes in a gas
phase have more or less mutual collisions due to Brownian diffusion, resulting in the
formation of bundles. It is very likely that nanotube growth can be terminated by
intertube collision, which restrains the growth of long nanotubes. Consequently, low
feeding of the optimal combination of catalyst precursor and carbon source would
produce narrow nanotube bundles with long length, due to low concentration of
catalyst particles and carbon radicals. Our previous work [15] also demonstrated that
lower feeding rate of precursors produce narrower SWCNT bundles, which needs to
be verified by using further lower feeding rate. In short, narrow bundles consisting of
large-diameter and long SWCNTs are greatly needed for the direct fabrication of
highly conductive SWCNT TCFs.
In this work, we adopted a very low feeding rate of precursors to produce long
and narrow SWCNT bundles for TCF fabrication. The doped TCF presents a low
sheet resistance of ca. 78 ohm/sq. at 90% transmittance. Then, both macro properties
and micro structure were explored to reveal the causes of the high conductivity. The
excellent optoelectronic performance of SWCNT TCFs highlights great potential
applications in flexible and transparent conductors, such as solar cells and organic
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of SWCNTs
The experimental details and optimization process have been described
elsewhere [15]. Briefly, 0.3 wt% ferrocene (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and a small amount
of thiophene (=99%, Sigma-Aldrich, molar ratio of S/Fe=0.2) were dissolved in
ethanol (99.5%, Altia Oyj, Finland) followed by 2 min-ultrasonication to form a
homogeneous solution which was injected with a syringe pump (New Era Pump
Systems, NE-1000 series, USA) at a feeding rate of 4 µl/min. The evaporated
precursors in a heating line was carried by 600 standard cubic centimeter (sccm)
gaseous mixture of H2 (99.999%, AGA, Finland) and N2 (vaporized from liquid
nitrogen, and purified by an oxygen/moisture trap, OT3-4, Agilent). In order to
visually illustrate the relevant causes when using the feeding rate of 4 µl/min, a higher
feeding rate of 8 µl/min was also employed with 800 sccm carrier gas, while all other
parameters were kept constant. In both cases, the volume ratio of H2 to N2 is 1:1.
SWCNTs were collected at the downstream of the reactor using a membrane filter
(Merck Millipore, France, diameter of 25 mm, pore size of 0.45 µm) to form a thin
film. The transparency of SWCNT film was controlled by collection time.
2.2. Doping of SWCNT films
SWCNT films on membrane filters were press-transferred to quartz slides
(35×20×1 mm) followed by drop-cast wetting of 16 mM fresh AuCl3 (=99.99% trace
metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) at room
temperature in atmosphere. 5 minutes later, the films were washed by pure acetonitrile
for sheet resistance measurement after drying naturally. AuCl3 was selected as a
dopant based on two reasons. The sheet resistances of AuCl3-doped SWCNT films are
relatively stable at ambient conditions. Additionally, the intrinsic structure of
SWCNTs could be preserved after AuCl3 treatment.
2.3. Measurement of sheet resistances
The sheet resistances of SWCNT films on quartz slides were measured with a
HP/Hewlett Packard 3485A multimeter four point probe system. The probe consists of
four needles made of tungsten with spacing of 1 mm between each other. The needle
has a radius of curvature of 100 µm and a loading force of 15 g each (60 g total). The
reading number was multiplied by a factor of 4.532 to calculate the actual sheet
resistance of SWCNT film. The presented sheet resistance value was averaged based
on three measurements for each sample. The data points were nonlinearly fitted based
on the method described in a literature [2].
2.4. Optical spectroscopy characterizations
A UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Agilent Cary 5000) was employed to acquire
optical absorption and transmittance spectra from SWCNT films on quartz slides in
the sample beam path while a blank quartz slide located in the reference beam path.
The transmittance values were read from the spectra at 550 nm. Raman spectra were
obtained using a Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon Labram HR 800) equipped
with excitation wavelengths of 488 nm, 514 nm and 633 nm. The displayed spectrum
was averaged based on three spectra detected by each laser.
2.5. Microscopy characterizations
Sparsely distributed SWCNTs were collected onto SiO2/Si substrate by
thermophoretic method [16] for measuring bundle length with scanning electron
microscope (SEM, Zeiss Sigma VP). In order to reduce charging effect, the
microscope was operated at an acceleration voltage of 1 kV using an Inlens electron
detector. Surface roughnesses of SWCNT films were acquired from atomic force
microscopy (AFM, Dimension 3100) scanning operated at tapping mode. SWCNT
films on membrane filters were press-transferred to SiO2/Si substrates, followed by
ethanol densification before AFM measurement. For transmission electron
microscope (TEM) observation, SWCNTs were directly deposited onto copper grid
coated with holey carbon film. A JEOL 2200FS Double Cs-corrected TEM was
employed for high-resolution imaging at 200 kV.
3. Results and discussion
Compared with our previous report [15], only the feeding rate of precursor
solution and the volume of carrier gas were adjusted in this work with other
parameters kept constant. We found that feeding rate must be matched with
appropriate volume of carrier gas in which both H2 and N2 play significant roles.
Moreover, not only H2, but also N2 has a very narrow window for the fabrication of
highly conductive SWCNT films. The optoelectronic results, at a feeding rate of 4
µl/min, of the optimized combination of H2 and N2 are displayed in Figure 1a. The
pristine film (partially ambient-doped) exhibits a sheet resistance value of ca. 360
ohm/sq. which drops to ca. 78 ohm/sq. at 90% transmittance through AuCl3 treatment.
Nevertheless, the collection time of 90 T% film with a diameter of 25 mm prolongs to
28 minutes (Figure 1b). After optimizing growth parameters by the assessment of
optoelectronic performance, samples were collected for optical spectroscopy and
electron microscopy characterizations to figure out the black box behind the
outstanding conductivity of SWCNT TCFs.

Optical absorption spectrum offers one route to check the macro properties of
SWCNT films. Therefore, optical absorption spectra were firstly studied. The optical
spectrum of SWCNTs is generally characterized by the van Hove singularity
  
transitions  and  of s-SWCNTs and  transition of metallic SWCNTs.
These three characteristic peaks (S11~2330 nm, S22~1270 nm, M11~850 nm) can be
clearly seen in the spectrum of pristine film while S11 and S22 disappear through
doping treatment of the pristine film by AuCl3 (Figure 2a). AuCl3 doping initiates a
charge transfer from SWCNTs to AuCl3, which gives rise to an increased work
function of SWCNTs and a downshift of Fermi level toward valence band [17],
modifying the van Hove singularity transitions of s-SWCNTs and vanishing S11 and
S22 peaks correspondingly. Utilizing the MATLAB code developed by Tian et al. [18],
the spectrum from pristine film displayed in Figure 2a was fitted to acquire diameter
distribution of SWCNTs. The fitting result concludes that the mean diameter of
SWCNTs is around 2 nm, and more than 60% SWCNTs locate in the diameter range
of 1.8~2.2 nm (Figure 2b). The absorption spectrum of SWCNT film obtained at a
higher feeding rate of 8 µl/min, and corresponding fitting result are displayed in
supporting information (Figure S1). No apparent distinction of diameters can be found
between two films with the variation of feeding rate. As mentioned above, large
diameter s-SWCNTs possess narrow band gaps which facilitate electron hopping from
valance band to conduction band, enhancing charge transport and improving
conductivity of SWCNT films accordingly.
To estimate the quality of SWCNT films, Raman spectroscopy method was
selected. The intensity ratio of graphitic (G) band (~1590 cm-1) to disorder (D) band
(~1340 cm-1), IG/ID, in Raman spectrum is usually calculated to semi-qualitatively
evaluate the quality of SWCNT films. Seen from Figure 3b, the D bands are nearly
invisible. Furthermore, IG/ID values were calculated to be 45, 55 and 106 for 488 nm,
514 nm and 633 nm laser, respectively, indicating high quality of SWCNT films. The
Raman spectra of SWCNT film gained at feeding rate of 8 µl/min are showed in
supporting information (Figure S2). All the IG/ID values are slightly lower than those
from SWCNT film collected at lower feeding rate of 4 µl/min. Likewise, the
diameters of resonant SWCNTs can also be calculated from the frequencies of radial
breathing mode (RBM) peaks (Figure 3a) following the equation of  =
/ + , where = 217.8 and  = 15.7 for film samples [18]. The majority of
the diameters of resonant SWCNTs are in the range of 1.5~2.3 nm which situates in
the diameter range obtained from the fitting result of absorption spectrum.

In order to deeply explore the causes of excellent conductivity of SWCNT films,
electron microscopy characterizations are needed to investigate the micro morphology
and structure. Firstly, surface morphology of SWCNT film was checked using SEM.
Figure 4a displays one SEM image of the surface morphology of an ethanol-densified
SWCNT film. As a comparison, one SEM image of the morphology of the SWCNT
film fabricated using a higher feeding rate of 8 µl/min is also showed in Figure 4b.
Compared with the morphology in Figure 4b, far fewer CNT loops and narrower
bundles are distinctly visible in Figure 4a. Moreover, surface roughnesses of SWCNT
films were also carried out by AFM. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of
SWCNT film obtained at feeding rate of 4 µl/min is only 9.2 ± 1.0 nm (Figure 4d),
while it increases to 15.1 ± 1.6 nm (Figure 4e) for the film fabricated at 8 µl/min,
which is ascribed to the thicker CNT bundles. The AFM result is consistent with that
from SEM observation. Since only feeding rate and carrier gas were altered in this
case, we consider that it is the decline of volume of carrier gas that accounts for the
reduction of number of CNT loops. Theoretical studies have proposed the existence of
back flow at the outlet of a quartz tube inside a high temperature furnace [19,20]. The
back flow boosted by the phenomenon of thermophoresis can trigger local convection
vortex which might be more obvious when using a high flow rate, bringing about
many CNT loops. Additionally, nanotubes in a bundle can have different growth
speeds, i.e. the inboard nanotube in a loop has lower growth speed while the outboard
nanotube grows faster, which is similar with the formation mechanism of carbon
nanocoils [21], promoting the formation of CNT loops as well. As was demonstrated
by electrostatic force microscopy, CNT loops behave like confining barriers which
can trap charge carriers
Figure 4. (a) and (b) are SEM micrographs of surface morphologies of
ethanol-densified ~90 T% SWCNT films at feeding rates of 4 µl/min and 8 µl/min,
respectively. (c) SEM micrograph of SWCNT bundles on SiO2/Si substrate at feeding

inside, restraining the transportation of charge carriers among nanotubes [22].
Consequently, SWCNT film containing fewer CNT loops exhibits higher conductivity.
In addition, the length of SWCNT bundle is another essential parameter that affects
film conductivity. Sparsely distributed SWCNTs were directly collected on SiO2/Si
substrate for SEM imaging (Figure 4c) to statistically gather SWCNT bundles for
measurement of bundle length. The histogram result shows a mean length of SWCNT
bundles of 28.4 µm (Figure 4f) which is significantly longer than those collected from
carbon monoxide reactors [2,6,9], and slightly longer than that collected from ethanol
reactor [15]. It was expected that the bundle length should have been even longer
based on two phenomena. On one hand, reduced volume of carrier gas increases the
growth time of SWCNTs at elevated temperature in a quartz tube. On the other hand,
lowered feeding rate decreases particle concentration in gas phase, which fates the
mutual collision of as-formed tubes, extending the final length of nanotubes. Thus, it
is supposed that insufficient counting of CNT bundles in our previous work [15]
might somehow overestimate the actual length. SWCNTs produced using the higher
feeding rate of 8 µl/min were also collected using the same method for length
measurement, though the majority of CNT bundles are entangled even at a very low
density (Supporting information, Figure S3). As a consequence, we failed to gather
enough individual CNT bundles for a statistical study. It has been affirmed that the
overall resistance of SWCNT networks is dominated by the resistances of contact
junctions [14]. Especially, the resistance of the junction between semiconducting
nanotubes and metallic counterparts contributes much more to the overall resistance
in virtue of the existence of Schottky barrier. Therefore, SWCNT film comprising of
long CNT bundles has fewer contact junctions, improving film conductivity as well.
TEM was utilized to reveal the structure of SWCNTs. SWCNTs are more or less
bundled in a SWCNT network, and the diameters of bundles in a thin film are
primarily determined by the bundles floating out from a reactor. Meanwhile, it should
be pointed out that some bundles can re-bundle during film formation, owing to the
attraction of van der Waals forces. Hence, a proper density of as-produced SWCNTs
were deposited onto a TEM grid situating on a membrane filter to observe the
diameters of SWCNT bundles. Similarly, SWCNTs produced with the higher feeding
rate of 8 µl/min were collected as well for TEM imaging to better illustrate the origins
of advanced conductivity. Several individual SWCNTs are visible in the TEM image
in Figure 5a which displays a few catalyst particles and small bundles. By statistically
counting 252 bundles, we were able to calculate the mean diameter of SWCNT
bundles to be 5.3 nm (Figure 5d), while the mean bundle diameter at 8 µl/min is
almost two times larger (Figure 5b and e). Remarkably, it was found that individual
SWCNTs account for 24.6% which is much higher than that from a higher feeding

rate of precursors. Higher feeding rate leads to increased concentration of catalyst
particles and carbon radicals which produce more nanotubes at a certain time,
promoting mutual collisions to form bundles. The individual ones (Figure 5c) were
divided from the whole counted counterparts and constitute a histogram showed in
Figure 5f. The diameter distribution of SWCNTs is nicely matched with that fitted
from absorption spectrum. Further gathering of individual SWCNTs will minimize the
discrepancy of mean diameters. The individual SWCNTs together with those narrow
bundles greatly enhance conductivity of film, which has been experimentally and
theoretically verified by our previous works using highly individual SWCNTs for thin
film studies [6,9,23]. They proposed that conduction paths would increase at a given
optical transparency in a film containing more individual tubes, since current transport
mainly occurs on the surface of bundles [23].

recently reported ones. (b) Photograph of a 25 mm SWCNT film on PET substrate.
Finally, the optoelectronic performance of the doped SWCNT TCFs in this work
was compared with some recently reported values [6,9,24–26] fabricated by the same
dry-transfer method. We found that the performance of our SWCNT TCFs fabricated
at low feeding rate of 4 µl/min is superior to most of the reported films (Figure 6a).
The SWCNT TCFs fabricated at higher feeding rate of 8 µl/min show a sheet
resistance value of ca. 123 ohm/sq. at 90% transmittance, meaning a 36.6%
improvement of film conductivity caused by lowering feeding rate. Mustonen et al. [6]
presented a low sheet resistance of 63 ohm/sq. at 90% transmittance, though the
collection time, even for a 13 mm film, is rather long, which is not applicable for
large scale fabrication. A 25 mm film near 90 T% was transferred to polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) substrate to demonstrate the transparency and flexibility of
SWCNT TCF (Figure 6b).
4. Conclusion
To conclude, we have demonstrated that using a low feeding rate of precursors
can produce long and narrow bundled SWCNTs for fabrication of highly conductive
TCFs from a FCCVD reactor. After AuCl3 doping, the TCFs exhibit a low sheet
resistance of ca. 78 ohm/sq. at 90% transmittance. The enhanced conductivity was
elucidated in terms of SWCNT diameter and micro morphology. The large diameter
SWCNTs possessing narrow band gaps intrinsically contribute a high concentration of
charge carriers. Besides, the conductivity is strongly related to CNT loops and bundle
length as well as bundle diameter. More straight and long CNT bundles will decrease
the transportation barriers of charge carriers, improving conductivity of SWCNT film.
Small CNT bundles and a high fraction of individual tubes will provide increased
number of conduction pathways. In summary, the micro morphology of CNT bundles
can be controlled by tuning the feeding rate of precursor solution. Fewer CNT loops
and higher fraction of individual SWCNTs are mainly responsible for the improved
conductivity using a low feeding rate in this work. The excellent optoelectronic
performance of demonstrated SWCNT TCFs indicates their potential applications in
solar cells, OLEDs, and further increases the likelihood to replace indium tin oxide
film.
