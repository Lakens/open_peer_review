Good that you pay attention to our paper and find it interesting. To substantiate our results by
using more modern and sophisticated stats is fine with me. However, note that we deliberately
used as simple stats as possible, just to make the results accessible to many non-scientific readers,
including decision makers, NGOs and e.g. the church people. It is encouraging for us that we
received the same result as you, or at least almost so!Please note that I have not evaluated your
stats. It is outside my field of expertise.Good luck!Jens Rydell

Although the analyses in the original paper by Rydell et al. were somewhat basic and perhaps
lacking in power compared with more sophisticated methods, the results were nonetheless clear,
and I do not believe that the new analysis adds value to the original study.

Author proposal is a more update and more precise statistical approach. It seems to me to be
justified.
I have only one minor comments, for readers it should be interested to include in figure naive
value (i.e. value of Rydell et a. 2017), I have note that authors write they find same the value in

Comments to the Author:
Perhaps the author could incorporate the views of two of the reviewers that the initial intent was
to use simple statistics that could be interpreted by the church personnel and land-use people
more accessibly.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-171312)
Dear Editor,
Thank you for accepting my manuscript for publication.
I have updated the manuscript. I added the basic estimates to fig. 1 as suggested by reviewer 3. In
a response to reviewer 1 I added a small paragraph to the discussion on what to present to non-
scientific readers. In my opinion both McNemar's test and ordinal regression sound complicated
for non-scientific readers.
Best regards,
ir. Thierry Onkelinx
