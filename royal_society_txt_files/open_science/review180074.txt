Dear Authors,
Article show interesting topic – improving of weathering characteristics of WPC. Experimental
works have wide range – strength, visual and chemical analyses after accelerated weathering.
Some comments:
Introduction
HDPE – it is necessary write all the name in the text when the first mentioned
Materials and Method
Line 35 Please try to define more clear that three different types of modifications by UV-
stabilizers were used when WPC was prepared – in this form could be mentioned, that
combination of 3 stabilizers was used in one product…
Results and Discussion
Figure 3 – it is evident, that total colour change dE* was mainly after 1000h created by da* and
db* parameters – what is discussed in more works (for example: Müller, U, Rätzsch, M,
Schwanninger, M, Steiner, M, Z<U+04E7>bl, H “Yellowing and IR-changes of spruce wood as a result of
UV irradiation.” J. Photochem. Photobiol. B, 69 97-105 (2003))
evaluated colour changes of wood caused by UV-decomposition of lignin – what well
corresponds with your results of chemical analyses – please discuss it.
Discussion is also part to mention not only strong parts of your experiment, but also weaknesses
of experiment. They are based on methods section:
1) Only comparative study between three different UV-stabilizers was done – changes of
concentrations can give different results. Also for UV-327 other research to find optimal
concentration is necessary.
2) combinations of different UV-stabilizers can give synergists effect on weathering stabilization.
3) using of UV with spraying with water (not only condensation) is better way to test material for
outdoor exposition
4) only 5 specimens to evaluate strength properties is relative low number.
Please discuss these ideas in discussion section as weakness of your experiment and another
steps of research.
If this topic is under interest of this journal, this work is after revisions (up mentioned comments)
suitable for publication.

I have reviewed the manuscript entitled "Light stabilizers added into the shell of coextruded
HDPE / wood-plastic composites to improve mechanical and anti-UV aging properties". In
general, I think the manuscript is well written but the big problem is lacks of novelty.
The co-extrusion method is not a new technology now. The additives used in this study were
UVAs and Nano-SiO2, which have been extensively studied by many researchers in the past few
years. Without having to carry out any experiments, these properties are definitely expected to
change since different materials were added in WPC and each additive having different
characteristics. UV-327 should be the best one, because it is a kind of commercial and professional
UVA.
The conclusion drawn from this work is not convincing since all additives used only one single
loading added into the WPC.

This manuscript descripted the mechanical and anti-UV aging properties of the wood-plastic
composites coextruded with HDPE shell added with Light stabilizers, which is of current interest.
It is clear and well organized. However, there are some minor refinements need to be addressed
for improved quality of the manuscript.
1. In lines 41-47, page 3, the authors stated that the UV-327 was the most effective light stabilizer
on protecting the flexural properties of the composites. This is incorrect. In my opinion, there is
no difference in the retention rate of the flexural strength between the samples added with UV-
327 and Nano-SiO2 (Figure 2). For the flexural property test, only five replicates were used, the
standard deviation is too high to judge which is better. In addition, the retention rate of the
flexural modulus of the samples added with Nano-SiO2 are higher than those with UV-327
throughout the aging process. So, please revise the statement about flexural property throughout
the manuscript including abstract and conclusion.
2. Please add error bar in Figure 3.
3. In Figure 4, smaller magnification of the SEM pictures should be used to get a whole view of
the samples.
4. In Figure 6, the C1s peak of the 0.5mm neat HDPE shell layer was diffracted into three
subpeaks corresponding to C-C/C-H, C-O and O-C=O, respectively. It is well known that, the
scanning depth of XPS is about 10nm and the neat HDPE presents only C-C/C-H peak. Where
the subpeaks of C-O and O-C=O come from?

But, I am surprised, that these answers were not added (in most cases) to the attached

Response 1:
Your previous work is not enough highlighted in the manuscript. And this information can make
more clear information for readers, why you use 2% concentrations.
Response 2 and 3: This could be mentioned in discussion section as ideas for other tests in
future…
Response number of replicates: This could be also mentioned in discussion section and give
answer for readers, why only 5 specimens were measured – but I think, that 5 for mechanical
properties is rather poor number…

Response: The sentences in line 35 were revised. All the revised content was
highlighted in yellow.
[3] Figure 3 – it is evident, that total colour change <U+0394>E* was mainly after 1000h
created by <U+0394>a* and <U+0394>b* parameters – what is discussed in more works (for
example: Müller, U, Rätzsch, M, Schwanninger, M, Steiner, M, Z<U+04E7>bl, H “Yellowing
and IR-changes of spruce wood as a result of UV irradiation.” J. Photochem.
Photobiol. B, 69 97-105 (2003)) evaluated colour changes of wood caused by UV-
decomposition of lignin – what well corresponds with your results of chemical
analyses – please discuss it.
Response: We found more work about discussing the <U+0394>a* and <U+0394>b* parameters. The
discoloration of the weathered samples after weathering was often described by the CIE
L*a*b* method, which determined the lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*).
[1-2] In this system, L* axis (+ L* for light, - L* for dark) represents the lightness, a*
(+a* is for red, -a* for green) and b* (+b* for yellow, -b* for blue) represent the
chromaticity coordinates [3-5]. The decrease of yellowness (<U+0394>b*) with exposure time
can be linked to the reduction of paraquinones (chromophoric structures) to
hydroquinones, which resulted in photobleaching and a more serious degradation of the
surface layer. [6] Darkness and yellowness observed in this stage of degradation of
coextruded composites could be attributed to quinone chromophoric structures
generated by the photodegradation of lignin [7-9] whereas redness was controlled by
the extractive contents in wood [8]. The strong correlations between lightness and wood
lignin degradation, lightness and carboxylic acid concentration, and lightness and
esterification were observed by Fabiyi et al. [10] and it was concluded that
delignification and oxidation led to an increased lightness. Coextrusion prevented
surface erosion and removal of degraded wood components (maintains adhesion
between fibres and matrix) thus the composites became dark and yellow but fades once
the cap layer was damaged due to removal of loose wood components by water spray.
The cap layer absorbed some UV light and reduced the availability of oxygen at the
interface of coextruded composites, thus decreasing the photodegradation rate. [1]
Therefore, WPC added with 2% UV-327 had the best protection for the discoloration,
showing the lowest values of <U+0394>E* (color difference) and <U+0394>L* (luminescence) in all
samples after 2500h of UV aging. This was consistent with the sample added with 2%
UV-327 being oxidized with the slightest extent after 2500h of UV aging in chemical
analysis.

[4] Discussion is also part to mention not only strong parts of your experiment, but
also weaknesses of experiment. They are based on methods section:
1) Only comparative study between three different UV-stabilizers was done –
changes of concentrations can give different results. Also for UV-327 other
research to find optimal concentration is necessary.
Response: We investigated the effects exerted by Nano-SiO2 content (0%, 1%, 2%, 5%
and 10%) on the weatherability of coextruded WPCs after 2500h of UV exposure.
Discoloration and durability of the composites were studied by colorimetry and
mechanical testing, as shown in Figure 1. Obtained results showed that the samples
incorporating with 2% nano-silica was the most effective in protecting the WPCs from
ultraviolet degradation. In addition, study by Li et al. [1] proved that 2% ultraviolet
absorber (UV-326) was the most effective additive in preventing WPCs from ultraviolet
degradation. Therefore, we determined the concentration of three UV-stabilizers by 2%.

2) combinations of different UV-stabilizers can give synergists effect on
weathering stabilization.
Response: Yes, we agree. Light stabilizers, including ultraviolet absorbers (UVA),
hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) and inorganic UV absorbers. UV-327, HS-944
and Nano-SiO2 represents three types of UV-stabilizers, respectively. Thus far, directly
comparing the roles played by each of the UVAs, HALSs, and Nano-SiO2 in the UV
degradation process for co-extruded WPCs has rarely been reported. Thus, we want to
study their individual effect first. We will study the synergistic effect of different UV-
stabilizers on weathering stabilization in the subsequent experiments.
3) using of UV with spraying with water (not only condensation) is better way to
test material for outdoor exposition
Response: Yes, we agree. It is more suitable to simulate outdoor conditions like repeated
rains. Water spray could also introduce thermal / cold shock and mechanical erosion of
the sample which complicate the analysis.
4) only 5 specimens to evaluate strength properties is relative low number.
Please discuss these ideas in discussion section as weakness of your experiment and
another steps of research.
Response: We agree that increased number of samples for testing will give a better
overall representation of the test sample variability. In general, the variability of well-
formulated WPC’s strength properties is fairly well. Five specimens have been used in
past work to evaluate strength of WPC. [1-4] Thus, we believe that the five replication
used was sufficient to show the trend.

Reviewer #2
[1] In general, I think the manuscript is well written but the big problem is lacks
of novelty. The co-extrusion method is not a new technology now. The additives
used in this study were UVAs and Nano-SiO2, which have been extensively studied
by many researchers in the past few years. Without having to carry out any
experiments, these properties are definitely expected to change since different
materials were added in WPC and each additive having different characteristics.
UV-327 should be the best one, because it is a kind of commercial and professional
UVA. The conclusion drawn from this work is not convincing since all additives
used only one single loading added into the WPC.
Response: The additives (UVAs and Nano-SiO2) used in this study have been
extensively studied in the past. However, the focus of our work was on comparing the
roles played by each of the UVAs, HALSs, and Nano-SiO2 in the UV degradation
process for co-extruded WPCs, which has rarely been reported. The aim of this study
was to find a suitable light stabilizer to improve mechanical and anti-UV aging
properties of coextruded WPCs. To achieve this purpose, various kinds of light
stabilizers were added to the shell of co-extruded WPCs to develop the composites with
low cost, high anti-UV aging property and good mechanical property. In addition, the
UV-aging and discoloration mechanisms of WPCs were discussed to provide a
theoretical basis for the applications of WPCs in outdoors. We selected one single
loading of additives in the WPC since this single loading was the optimal concentration
established from previous work.
Reviewer #3
[1] In lines 41-47, page 3, the authors stated that the UV-327 was the most effective
light stabilizer on protecting the flexural properties of the composites. This is
incorrect. In my opinion, there is no difference in the retention rate of the flexural
strength between the samples added with UV-327 and Nano-SiO2 (Figure 2). For
the flexural property test, only five replicates were used, the standard deviation is
too high to judge which is better. In addition, the retention rate of the flexural
modulus of the samples added with Nano-SiO2 are higher than those with UV-327
throughout the aging process. So, please revise the statement about flexural
property throughout the manuscript including abstract and conclusion.
Response: The statement about flexural property throughout the manuscript were
revised. All the revised contents were highlighted in yellow.
[2] Please add error bar in Figure 3.
Response: The error bar was added in Figure 3.
[3] In Figure 4, smaller magnification of the SEM pictures should be used to get a
whole view of the samples.
Response: Some pictures were added (as shown in Figure 2) to get a whole view of the
samples.
Figure.2 Color changes of all samples before and after UV weathering
[4] In Figure 6, the C1s peak of the 0.5mm neat HDPE shell layer was diffracted
into three subpeaks corresponding to C-C/C-H, C-O and O-C=O, respectively. It
is well known that, the scanning depth of XPS is about 10nm and the neat HDPE
presents only C-C/C-H peak. Where the subpeaks of C-O and O-C=O come from?
Response: It is well known that the neat HDPE presents only C-C/C-H peak in XPS
analysis. However, neat HDPE and additives (polyethylene wax) went through the four
stages (drying, blending, granulation and extrusion) to become the shell layer of
coextruded WPCs. A high-resolution scan was conducted on the C1s region for the
samples surface to determine the types and amounts of carbon-oxygen bonds present.
The C1s peak was deconvoluted into four subpeaks, C1, C2, C3, and C4 (-C-C- or -C-
H at 284.6eV; -C-O at 285.9eV; -C=O at 287.7eV; O-C=O at 288.8eV). [1-3] The C1
peak does not have a carbon-oxygen bond, whereas C2, C3, and C4 all possess a
carbon-oxygen bond. [4-6]

Responses to reviewers’ comments
We appreciate the detailed and helpful comments and suggestions for improving the
quality of our manuscript. The manuscript (RSOS-180074.R1) was carefully revised as
required. All new and revised contents are highlighted in yellow in our revised version.
The point-by-point answers to the comments and suggestions were listed below.
Reviewer: 1
[1] Response 1: Your previous work is not enough highlighted in the manuscript.
And this information can make more clear information for readers, why you use
2% concentrations.
Response: The effects of Nano-SiO2 content at 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% and 10% loading level
on the weatherability of coextruded WPCs after 2500h of UV exposure were
investigated in our preliminary study. We found that the samples incorporating with 2%
nano-silica was the most effective in protecting the WPCs from ultraviolet degradation,
which provides basis for choosing the loading level. Also, there are many researches on
the effects of UV absorbers (UVAs) or hindered amine light stabilizers (HALSs)
concentrations on the mechanical and anti-UV aging properties of coextruded WPCs
after UV exposure. [1-6] For instance, study by Li et al. showed that 2% ultraviolet
absorber (UV-326) was the most effective additive in preventing WPCs from ultraviolet
degradation. Therefore, we chose the concentration of three UV-stabilizers by 2%. We
agree that effect may vary with different loading level. Here we provided a matched
comparative study at the 2% loading level for all three light stabilizers.

[2] Response 2 and 3: This could be mentioned in discussion section as ideas for
other tests in future…
Response: Yes, we agree. We added some discussion to the text. We will study the
synergistic effect of different UV-stabilizers on weathering stabilization in the
subsequent experiments. In addition, using of UV with spraying with water is a better
way to test material for outdoor exposition. It is more suitable to simulate outdoor
conditions like repeated rains.
[3] Response number of replicates: This could be also mentioned in discussion
section and give answer for readers, why only 5 specimens were measured – but I
think, that 5 for mechanical properties is rather poor number…
Response: We agree that increase number of samples for testing will give a better
overall representation of the test sample variability. However, five specimens have been
used in past work to evaluate the mechanical properties of coextruded WPCs. [1-5]
WPCs normally have less property variability among different samples compared with
natural wood. Thus, it is often sufficient with five sample replications.

Reviewer: 3
The Composites added with Nano-SiO2 had similar values of retention rates in
flexural strength with but higher values of retention rates in flexural modulus than
those added with UV-327. How did you get the conclusion that the UV-327 was the
most effective light stabilizer on improving the mechanical and anti-UV aging
properties of the composites?
Response: Yes, we agree that the composites added with Nano-SiO2 had similar values
of retention rates in flexural strength with but higher values of retention rates in flexural
modulus than those added with UV-327. However, the addition of the UV-327 had a
better protection for the surface discoloration of the composites, demonstrating the
lowest values of the luminescence (<U+0394>L*) and color difference (<U+0394>E*) in all samples
after 2500h of UV aging. This was consistent with the SEM images that WPC added
with 2% UV-327 had the smoothest surface after 2500h of UV aging. In addition, the
UV-327 was the most effective light stabilizer on improving the photo-oxidative
degradation of the composites than the others, showing the lowest increase in the
Cox/unox ratio of the samples added with 2% UV-327 by 14.8% in all samples after 2500h
of UV aging. Therefore, the obtained results showed that the UV-327 was the more
effective light stabilizer on improving the mechanical and anti-UV aging properties of
the composites. Thus our discussion is limited to the three stabilizers used in the study.
We modified the use of words like “optimal” and “most” as shown in the text.
