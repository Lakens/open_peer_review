This manuscript by Luo and coworkers described a three-step synthetic method for the
preparation of heptafluoroisobutyronitrile with total 42% chemical yield, by the use of easily
available and less toxic hexafluoropropylene, oxalyl chloride, KF and 8-crown-6, which afforded
a new and efficient access to such insulating gas, heptafluoroisobutyronitrile. The compounds
have been carefully characterized, and the reasonable mechanism has been provided. This
method is useful and may be applied in the industry. Thus, this review recommend acceptance of
this manuscript for publication on R. Soc. open sci., but after revisions listed below:

Appendix A
Although I am not able to judge if the manuscript entitled „ Novel
Efficient Synthesis Route of Insulating Gas- Heptafluoroisobutyronitrile
from Hexafluoropropylene”
is written in sufficiently correct English, I am sure that it requires
linguistic corrections. Selected sentences requiring adjustment are
listed in the attachment. In addition, the manuscript can be shortened by
removing a lot of obvious information. Basically, it can be defined as
text containing too much unnecessary information. Therefore, in my
opinion, this manuscript should be sent to the evaluation only after the
rewriting
In recent years, various known gases, such as CO2,6,7 N2,8,9 CF3I10 and c-C4F811 have
been extensively been tested as insulation gases because of their insulation
properties and arc-extinct performances
The method consisted of preparing bis-(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone, then was
transformed into
heptafluoroisobutyramide.
P3 line 42-43-- Whereas the methyl heptafluoroisobutyrate was too
expensive, this would dramatically increase production cost.
P3 line 45 The conversion of amide to nitrile is well known to follow a general step
P3 line 50-57- In 1977, Ishikawa18 employed oxalyl dichloride, KF and HFP as
starting materials to prepare perfluoro-2,5-dimethyl-3,4- hexanedione. The production
of bis-(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone was generated accidentally during the experiment.
Though the bis-(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone yield was only 20%, it helped us to build
our research strategy.
P3 line 60-51- The route consisted of three-steps, in which the structures of were
confirmed each of them.
P4 line 2-3- Overall, compared to other synthetic methods, the proposed route
was ready availability of reactant, simple synthesis, low cost, high yield with little
pollution to environment.
3.3. Synthesis of second step product - C3F7CONH2
CH3OH (100.0 mL) and NH3 (0.42 mol) were added to bis-(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone
(50.0 g, 0.14 mol) at 0 0C. After stirring for 6 h, the solvent was removed in vacuum
and the residue was dissolved in chloroform (100.0 mL) followed by, recrystallization
to yield, colourless transparent crystals of C3F7CONH2.
P5 line 48-49- The 18-crown-6 as a PTC could react with K+, where F- could be
employed to attack the substrate. In this process, molar concentration of PTC would
impact the reaction yield.
P5 line 53-60- The reason for this had to do with the concentration
of F-, which increased rapidly with enhancement of catalyst dosage. However, the
yield of 3 did not rise with further increase in the catalyst dosage, indicating that 3
mol% of PTC was enough for conversion of 2c. Further addition of PTC would
increase the production cost 3. Therefore, the optimal molar ratio of conversion of
PTC to 2c was 3 mol% (entry 3).
P6 line 4-13- he yield of 3 gradually improved with temperature from 70 oC to 90 oC,
ascribed to increase in vibration frequency and accelerated thermal motion of
molecules. However, the yield decreased as temperature further rose (100~120 oC),
attributed to production of more by-products. Thus, the optimal reaction temperature
was identified as 90 oC (entry 7). Observably, this reaction could be scaled up to 150
g in 2.5 L reaction vessel with higher yield, and 3 could easily be separated by
distillation.
Appendix B
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments
concerning our manuscript entitled “Novel Efficient Synthesis Route of
Insulating Gas- Heptafluoroisobutyronitrile from Hexafluoropropylene”
(ID: RSOS-181751). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful
for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully and
have made correction which we hope to meet with approval. The main
corrections in the paper and the responses to the reviewer’s comments
are as following:
Responses to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer :1
Comment 1: The manuscript needs careful reading, there were
many typos and format errors.
Response: We are sorry for typos and format errors. We have
carefully corrected these mistakes throughout the manuscript according
to your comment.
Comment 2: The schemes in the manuscript: 1) the “+” in all the
schemes needed redrawing; 2) Column 3 of Table 3, “NH3/3 (mol)”
makes no sense, please indicate clearly. Maybe “NH3 (equiv)” is better;
3) Figure 2c, the first step is not correct. TFAA should be placed on the
arrow.
Response: 1) Thank you very much to point out the “+”in all
scheme’s issues in our manuscript. According to comments from you,
we redraw the “+” in all schemes.
2) Thank you for your instructive suggestion. We considered that
the “NH3/3 (mol)” represented “the molar ratio of NH3/3”. However, the
irrational use of unit(mol) made the “NH3/3 (mol)” no sense. Now, we
have corrected the error in the new manuscript.
3) Thank you very much. According to your comment, we redraw
the Figure 2c and TFAA have been placed on the arrow.

Comment 3: The data list of C NMR were not correct. The
coupling constant should be provided for CF3, CF, instead of listing all
the peaks.
Response: Thank you for your valuable advice. We have corrected
it in the new manuscript and also list as follows:
Bis-(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone: 13C NMR (CDCl3, 126 MHz) d
182.00 (t, J=21.9 Hz), 121.04-115.36(m), 92.4(dt, J=192.4, 28.0 Hz).
C3F7CONH2: 13C NMR (CDCl3, 126 MHz) d 159.64 (d, J=17.1 Hz),
121.49-115.78 (m), 88.44(dt, J=182.7 Hz, 26.8 Hz).
Comment 4: The author only mentioned the size of KF particle,
whether the water content of KF showed some effect on the yield?
Response: Thank you very much. According to your comments,
we supplement the experiment that the effect of water content of KF on
the yield. The experiment results are listed as follows:

process with large particle size (<48 µm). d dried by spray process with small
particle size (1.0~15 µm). e KF reagents were dried in muffle furnace at 280 oC
for 2 h prior to use. f KF reagents were exposed to air for 0.5 h prior to use. g KF
reagents were exposed to air for 1 h prior to use.
As illustrated in Table 1, the yield was fell to less than 50% with
water content of KF increasing from 2c to 2e, which it was attributed to
hydrolysis of oxalyl dichloride.
Thanks again for your comments and suggestions.
Review: 2
Comment 1: Although I am not able to judge if the manuscript
entitled “Novel Efficient Synthesis Route of Insulating Gas-
Heptafluoroisobutyronitrile from Hexafluoropropylene” is written in
sufficiency correct English, I am sure that it requires linguistic
corrections. Selected sentences requiring adjustment are listed in the
attachment. In addition, the manuscript can be shortened by removing a
lot of obvious information. Basically, it can be defined as text containing
too much unnecessary information. Therefore, in my opinion, this
manuscript should be sent to the evaluation only after the rewriting.
Response: Thank you for your careful reading our manuscript. We
have carefully corrected sentences requiring adjustment and polished
the manuscript with a professional assistance in writing. Results of our
modifications are as follows:
(1) In recent years, various known gases, such as CO2, N2, CF3I
and c-C4F8 have been extensively been tested as insulation gases
because of their insulation properties and arc-extinct performances.
Correction: In recent years, insulation properties and arc-extinct
performances of some gases have been analyzed, such as CO2, N2, CF3I
and c-C4F8.
(2) The method consisted of preparing bis-(perfluoroisopropyl)
ketone, then was transformed into heptafluoroisobutyramide.
Correction: The synthetic route involved halogen-exchange
fluorination, decomposition of bis-(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone and
dehydration reaction.
(3) P3 line 42-43-- Whereas the methyl heptafluoroisobutyrate was
too expensive, this would dramatically increase production cost.
Correction: However, the methyl heptafluoroisobutyrate was of
considerable expense, which would dramatically increase the
production cost.
(4) P3 line 45 The conversion of amide to nitrile is well known to
follow a general step.
Correction: The general methodology to preparation nitriles is
dehydration reactions of amides.
(5) P3 line 50-57- In 1977, Ishikawa18 employed oxalyl dichloride,
KF and HFP as starting materials to prepare perfluoro-2,5-dimethyl-3,4-
hexanedione. The production of bis-(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone was
generated accidentally during the experiment. Though the bis-
(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone yield was only 20%, it helped us to build
our research strategy.
Correction: In 1977, Ishikawa18 employed oxalyl dichloride, KF
and HFP as starting materials to prepare perfluoro-2,5-dimethyl-3,4-
hexanedione. But much to surprise, bis-(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone was
generated with 20% yield.
(6) P3 line 60-51- The route consisted of three-steps, in which the
structures of were confirmed each of them.
Correction: The route consisted of a three-step, in which
structures of products were confirmed.
(7) P4 line 2-3- Overall, compared to other synthetic methods, the
proposed route was ready availability of reactant, simple synthesis, low
cost, high yield with little pollution to environment.
Correction: Overall, compared with other synthetic methods, the
proposed route was easily to operate with low cost, high yield and little
pollution.
(8) 3.3. Synthesis of second step product - C3F7CONH2
CH3OH (100.0 mL) and NH3 (0.42 mol) were added to bis-
(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone (50.0 g, 0.14mol) at 0 oC. After stirring for
6 h, the solvent was removed in vacuum and the residue was dissolved
in chloroform (100.0 mL) followed by, recrystallization to yield,
colorless transparent crystals of C3F7CONH2.
Correction: 3.3. Synthesis of second step product - C3F7CONH2
CH3OH (100.0 mL) and NH3 (0.42 mol) were added to bis-
(perfluoroisopropyl) ketone (50.0 g, 0.14 mol) at 0 oC. After stirring for
6 h, the solvent was removed in vacuum and the residue was crystallized
from chloroform (100.0 mL). Colorless crystals of C3F7CONH2 was
obtained.
(9) P5 line 48-49- The 18-crown-6 as a PTC could react with K+,
where F- could be employed to attack the substrate. In this process,
molar concentration of PTC would impact the reaction yield.
Correction: The 18-crown-6 could complex selectively with K+,
and F- was introduced into organic phase to attack the substrate. The
molar concentration of PTC would affect the conversion of 2c during
this process.
(10) P5 line 53-60- The reason for this had to do with the
concentration of F-, which increased rapidly with enhancement of
catalyst dosage. However, the yield of 3 did not rise with further
increase in the catalyst dosage, indicating that 3 mol% of PTC was
enough for conversion of 2c. Further addition of PTC would increase
the production cost 3. Therefore, the optimal molar ratio of conversion
of PTC to 2c was 3 mol% (entry 3).
Correction: The reason was that the concentration of F- was
improved rapidly with increase in the catalyst dosage. However, the
yield of 3 stayed stable at around 60% with further addition of the
catalyst dosage, indicating that 3 mol% of PTC was enough. Therefore,
the optimal molar ratio of PTC to 2c was 3 mol% (entry 3).
(11) P6 line 4-13- The yield of 3 gradually improved with
temperature from 70 oC to 90 oC, ascribed to increase in vibration
frequency and accelerated thermal motion of molecules. However, the
yield decreased as temperature further rose (100~120 oC), attributed to
production of more by-products. Thus, the optimal reaction temperature
was identified as 90 oC (entry 7). Observably, this reaction could be
scaled up to 150 g in 2.5 L reaction vessel with higher yield, and 3 could
easily be separated by distillation.
Correction: As shown in Table 2, the yield of 3 gradually
improved with temperature from 70 oC to 90 oC. However, the yield was
falling rapidly to 35% when the temperature raised to 120 oC, attributing
to production of more by-products. Thus, the optimal reaction
temperature was identified as 90 oC (entry 7). It was worth mentioning
that this reaction could be scaled up to 150 g in 2.5 L reaction vessel
with high yield, and 3 could easily be separated by distillation.
In addition, we have deleted some obvious information to make the
manuscript more concise.
Once again, thank you for your comments and suggestions.
