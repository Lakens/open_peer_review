The author reported that F-doped ZnO microdisks were prepared by one-pot solution methods
and used for photodetection. The work provided a new synthesis method of ZnO disks.
Therefore, in my opinion, this manuscript can be accepted in the journal after the following minor
revisions.
1) The state and amount of F-doping should be explored by XPS spectra.
2) The effect of F ions should be considered in the manuscript.

Dear Editor,
Thank you for forwarding us the reviewers’ comments. We
appreciate the time and efforts by you in handing and reviewing our
manuscript entitled “NH4F Assisted One-pot Solution Synthesis of
Hexagonal ZnO Microdisks for Efficient Ultraviolet
Photodetection” (RSOS-180822).
We appreciate all the valuable comments and helpful suggestions
from the reviewers. The manuscript has been revised according to the
helpful suggestions. Ethics statement has been added in the manuscript.
Point-by-point response to the reviewer’s questions and comments are
listed in the following. All changes have been marked in our revised
manuscript.
Thank you very much for your time and kind consideration!
We are looking forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
Prof. Guojia Fang
Response to reviewers’ comments:
Reviewer #1: Detailed questions:
1- The thickness of microdisks must be reported.
Response:
We have conducted the thickness measurement through SEM. The
thickness of microdisks fabricated by adding 0 M, 0.01 M, 0.03 M and
0.05 M NH4F are about 1.5 µm,2 µm,7 µm and 4 µm, individually,
according to the SEM images. The results are added in page 7 in the
manuscript.
2- What is photoresponsivity of other samples?
Response:
We have measured the photoresponsivity of other samples under 365
nm light illumination at a power density of 0.19 mW/cm-2. All the
devices measured at -1 V bias. The photoresponsivity of 0 M, 0.01 M
and 0.05 M NF4F doped samples are 1.19 A/W, 0.66 A/W and 0.85
A/W, respectively. The results are added in page 14 in the manuscript.
3- What is the atmosphere of the UV measurements? [Journal
of Alloys and Compounds 735 (2018) 1406-1413]
Response:
The reviewer has made excellent contribution on the relationship of
atmosphere and UV measurements and have found the difference of
UV response under argon and oxygen atmosphere. Thanks for the
suggestion. We will consider it in our future work. In this manuscript
we conducted all the measurement under room temperature and
without argon or oxygen gas flow. So that the atmosphere effect is not
considered in the manuscript.
4- Fig.5c shows two response and recovery times. The fast and
slow times should be indicated. [Optics Communications 413
(2018) 131–135]
Response:
Thank you for the suggestion. We have conduct the exponential fitting
and got the slow response time is 12.92 s and slow recovery time is
3.58 s. The results have been added in the manuscript. The results are
added in page 14 in the manuscript.
5- What is spectral photoresponsivity of the sample? [Journal of
Alloys and Compounds 615 (2014) 227–233]
Response:
Thank you for the suggestion. We have measured the spectral
photoresponsivity of the sample through a lock-in amplifier
measurement system and put the diagram in the electronic supporting
materials. The device shows a relatively high response in the UV range.
This relatively response may originate from the ZnO microdisk. The
results are added in page 15 in the manuscript.
6- English of text should be checked.
Response:
Thank you for the suggestion. We will carefully check our English of
text.
Reviewer #2: Detailed questions:
1) The state and amount of F-doping should be explored by
XPS spectra.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have conducted the XPS
measurement for the sample to determine the amount of F-doping. In
the result we can get that the resulted F concentration are 4.3%, 6.3%
and 17% for 0.01 M, 0.03 M and 0.05 M NH4F doping. However,
XPS depicts the surface information more than bulk. Herein we also
have performed the EDS analysis and found that the F concentration
are 4% and 9% for 0.03 M and 0.05 M samples. Regretfully we have
got the F concentration for 0.01 M sample, mostly due to the relatively
low sensitivity of F element in EDS measurement. The results are
added in page 8 in the manuscript.
2) The effect of F ions should be considered in the manuscript.
Response:
Thanks for your suggestion. We will discuss the effect of F ions in the
manuscript and added it in page 9 in the manuscript.
List of changes:
All the changes have been marked in blue in the paper.
1. Thickness measurement suggested by reviewer #1 has been added
in the manuscript.
2. Photoresponsivity of other samples has been added in the
manuscript.
3. Response time extraction has been added in the manuscript.
4. Spectral photoresponsivity has been added in the manuscript.
5. F concentration measurement and effects of F ion has been added in the
manuscript.
