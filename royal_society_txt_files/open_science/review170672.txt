This manuscript describes that iron-based magnetic molecular imprinted polymers for DnPP
(Fe(0)@SiO2@MIP) were prepared and the binding behavior of DnPP toward Fe(0)@SiO2@MIP
was examined, including the effects of pH, ion strength, temperature on the binding of DnPP,
cross reactivity of the reference compounds. Finally, the recovery and the reusable tests were
performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of (Fe(0)@SiO2@MIP).
Unfortunately, iron-based magnetic molecular imprinted polymers have been widely studied and
the present study seems to be an extension of such previous work; only difference is the template
molecule, DnPP. I failed to find any breakthrough in terms of the preparation procedure, the
developed functionality, and the applications on this manuscript. Consequently, I believe that
this manuscript may be suitable for more specialized analytical chemistry-based journals than
Royal Society Open Science.

The conditions and the procedures of the rebinding experiments are not clear. The authors should
describe details of such information, including the solvent used, the concentrations (or amounts)
of the nanoparticles, the sample concentrations etc.
2. Page 12, Lines 2-5 from the bottom
Although the authors mentioned that there is no thermo-responsibility, the evidence data should
be necessary for supporting the claim.
3. Page 13, Lines 3-5
It is known that NIPAm possesses no pH-dependent electrostatic interaction activity, although
the authors mentioned that it was because the functional groups (carboxyl and amino groups) in
monomers, methacrylic acid and N-isopropyl acrylamide, were easily affected by acid and alkali
conditions. The authors should explain why NIPAm can develop the pH dependency.

There is no error bars in Figure 4, therefor, the authors’ claim on the date cannot be acceptable.
5. Supporting Information, Page 2, Section 3
The authors should describe what is the predominant driving force (or the interaction) between
MAA/NIPAm and DnPP in the main text, in order to give the readers a possible mechanism of
the recognition phenomena in this system.

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you and the Reviewers for your good suggestions and comments on our
manuscript entitled “Iron-based magnetic molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) and
their application in removal and determination of di-n-pentyl phthalate in aqueous
media”. Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving
our paper. We have revised the manuscript according to your comments. The detailed
corrections are listed below point by point.
Answers to Reviewer 1:
1. Synthesized Fe@SiO2@MIP used for magnetic solid extraction is potential for
PAEs enrichment, the LOD of method should describe in Abstract.
Answers: It is a good suggestion. The content about the LOD has been added in
abstract section.
2. Adsorption capacity of different adsorbents dependent on temperature and other
parameters, from the reader's point of view, it’s better to describe the conditions of the
maximum adsorption capacity by different adsorbents In Table 2; Also, the maximum
adsorption capacity of DnBP added maybe better, though the article is not focus on
DnBP.
Answers: Thank you for your kind suggestion. It is really an aspect we should take
attention when comes to the comparison of maximum adsorption capacities. We have
added the information of adsorption conditions and introduced the adsorption capacity
of DnBP for comparison in revised manuscript.
3. In Page 8, 2.4, When the Fe@SiO2@NIP appeared for the first time, please indicate
the full name in parentheses;
Answers: Thank you for reminding us to add this important information. We have
made illustration of Fe@SiO2@NIP in the synthesis part Page 7, 2.2. We thought this
place was more appropriate to make description.
Answers to Reviewer 2
This manuscript describes that iron-based magnetic molecular imprinted polymers for
DnPP (Fe(0)@SiO2@MIP) were prepared and the binding behavior of DnPP toward
Fe(0)@SiO2@MIP was examined, including the effects of pH, ion strength,
temperature on the binding of DnPP, cross reactivity of the reference compounds.
Finally, the recovery and the reusable tests were performed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of (Fe(0)@SiO2@MIP).
Unfortunately, iron-based magnetic molecular imprinted polymers have been widely
studied and the present study seems to be an extension of such previous work; only
difference is the template molecule, DnPP. I failed to find any breakthrough in terms
of the preparation procedure, the developed functionality, and the applications on this
manuscript. Consequently, I believe that this manuscript may be suitable for more
specialized analytical chemistry-based journals than Royal Society Open Science.
Answers: Thank you for your comments. In this paper, the iron-based magnetic
molecular imprinted polymers were applied to remove and detect DnPP in aqueous
media. Though analogous material has been studied before, the application in this area
is novel. According to your advice, We have corrected our paper carefully, and more
explanations of results have been given in the corrected version. We hope your
questions have been clearly explained and our efforts meet with your approval.
1. Page 8, Section 2
The conditions and the procedures of the rebinding experiments are not clear.3.7 The
authors should describe details of such information, including the solvent used, the
concentrations (or amounts) of the nanoparticles, the sample concentrations etc.
Answers: We had described the details of rebinding experiments. After a 10 h
adsorption process in 100 mL 10 mg L-1 DnPP aqueous solution, 10 mg
Fe@SiO2@MIP materials were magnetically collected and dispersed in 5 mL
methanol and vibrated for 10 min for twice to remove the adsorbed DnPP. This
process was kept for 8 times to testify the recycable performance.
2. Page 12, Lines 2-5 from the bottom
Although the authors mentioned that there is no thermo-responsibility, the evidence
data should be necessary for supporting the claim.
Answers: Thank you for your suggestion. We have provided the evidence data as a
graph (figure S1) in electronic supplementary material and made explaination in main
text (3.1). In figure S1, there is almost no fluctuation of transmittance when
temperature changes, indicating no thermo-responsibility existed.
3. Page 13, Lines 3-5
It is known that NIPAm possesses no pH-dependent electrostatic interaction activity,
although the authors mentioned that it was because the functional groups (carboxyl
and amino groups) in monomers, methacrylic acid and N-isopropyl acrylamide, were
easily affected by acid and alkali conditions. The authors should explain why NIPAm
can develop the pH dependency.
Answers: Thank you for your comment. What we want to emphasize here is the
changes of charge property on Fe@SiO2@MIP surface. The DnPP exist as neutral
molecule and is unlikely to be influenced by changes in the sample solution pH.
Therefore, it was speculated that the pH-influenced adsorption efficiency was
attributed to the dissociation of groups in MIPs, especially the carboxyl group in
methacrylic acid. This could be elucidated from the sharply decreased adsorption
efficiency at alkaline condition. This phenomenon impeded the formation of hydrogen
bonding and inhibited hydrophobic interaction. From this point of view, we have
rephrased the expression in main text 3.2.
4. There is no error bars in figure 4, therefor, the authors’ claim on the date cannot be
acceptable.
Answers: Thank you for your comment. The bars have been added in figure 4.
5. Supporting Information, Page 2, Section 3
The authors should describe what is the predominant driving force (or the interaction)
between MAA/NIPAm and DnPP in the main text, in order to give the readers a
possible mechanism of the recognition phenomena in this system.
Answers: Thank you for your suggestion. The predominant driving force as imprinted
interaction between MAA/NIPAm and DnPP was estimated to be hydrogen bonding.
And we have made introduction in main text 2.2.
Thank you again for your cordially helps. All the suggestions are valuable and helpful
for revising our paper and improving our researches. The paper has been revised and
improved according to the suggestions of editor and reviewers. We tried our best to
improve the manuscript and some changes have been made in the manuscript. These
changes will not influence framework of the paper. And here we did not list the
changes but marked with red color (for addition) and blue color with strikeout (for
deletion) in revised paper. The revised manuscript has been submitted to your journal.
We look forward to your positive response.
Best wishes to you!
