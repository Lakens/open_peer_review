Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I have studied the manuscript "A Model of Urban Scaling Laws Based on Distance-dependent
Interactions" by Ribeiro and coauthors. Here the authors propose an interesting model for
describing allometric law between urban indicators and city population. The model is based on
how distant individuals interact and also on the fractal geometric of the urban forms. The authors
show that different behaviors emerge when individuals have short-range interactions or long-
range interactions. In particular, according to the model, individuals should have long-range
interactions for describing the sublinear allometries of infrastructure metrics. Analytical results
are also confronted with simulations.
In summary, I find the paper can be published if the authors consider the following comments.
1) There are several problems with the references such as duplicate citations (for instance, refs. 5,
9 and 10 are the same as well as 6 and 8), incomplete ones (refs. 18, 20, 21, 23, 26, etc...). The
authors should also verify if the cited preprints already are published, for instance, ref. 11 is a
preprint from 2009. There are also misprinted names.
2) I also think the authors are missing an important discussion regarding allometries in cities: the
problem of defining the city boundaries. There important recent works that have found that the
allometric exponent changes according to the definition of a city. See, for instance,

I know that this paper is not defining cities. But a mechanistic support (such as the present
model) for the city allometries can enhance the support of these empirical studies. The authors
could comment whether their model can contribute to this discussion or not.
3) Figure 3 and Figure 4 are the same.
4) The simulation results are surprisingly noiseless. I wonder if the authors have run some
ensemble average. The author should also provide more details on how the results of figs. 5 and 6
were obtained. For instance, how were the values of N chosen (it seems they are chosen from a
particular range and not from a probability distribution)?
5) As the authors have probably noticed, the empirical allometries have noise. In fact, for
comparing cities of different sizes researchers have employed the residuals surrounding the
scaling laws. See, for instance,

Can this model explain also explain the fluctuations surrounding the empirical allometries? For
instance, in the previous papers, researchers have found that these fluctuations are log-normally
distributed.
6) I like the idea of your sentence:
"One way to archive greater urban development is to increase the density of the cities and
consequently the fractal dimension. Public policies can be useful to achive this objective.
However, the side effect of this strategy is that it can decrease the quality of life of the citizens. On
the other hand, the city development can be improved, according to the model, by decreasing <U+03B3>,
which means increasing the interaction range between the citizens. In practical aspects, this is
achieved by creating polices able of promoting distant individuals to interact by decreasing the
cost of transportation, or improving and diversifying urban mobility."
However, by reducing <U+03B3> (or increasing the interaction range between individuals), your model
also predicts that socio-economic and environmental metrics such as crime, suicides and carbon
emissions will be enhanced in large cities. The authors could comment on that too. Furthermore,
how the authors think a model can differentiate between this urban metrics?
7) Finally, the authors could consider a fine text revision. There several misprints over the main
text. For instance, in the above-mentioned sentence, you have "achive" and "polices". I list a few
more below.

In the manuscript entitled "A Model of Urban Scaling Laws Based on Distance
dependent Interactions" by Fabiano et al, the authors propose that the empirical scaling laws
reported in city data can be explained considering distant-depend interactions at agent level,
where the long-range interaction is an important property from which
the scaling laws emerge. The manuscript offers original and important theoretical results which
are in nice agreement with empirical data.
The manuscript is correctly written and deserves publication in Royal Society Open Science.

Response to Referee 1
Comment 1
There are several problems with the references such as duplicate citations (for instance,
refs. 5, 9 and 10 are the same as well as 6 and 8), incomplete ones (refs. 18, 20, 21, 23,
26, etc...). The authors should also verify if the cited preprints already are published, for
nstance, ref. 11 is a preprint from 2009. There are also misprinted names.
Answer 1
We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We removed the duplicated
references, fixed the misprinted names and incomplete ones and cited the final version of
the cited printed references when available.
Comment 2
I also think the authors are missing an important discussion regarding allometries in cities:
he problem of defining the city boundaries. There important recent works that have found
hat the allometric exponent changes according to the definition of a city. (...) I know that
his paper is not defining cities. But a mechanistic support (such as the present model)
for the city allometries can enhance the support of these empirical studies. The authors
could comment whether their model can contribute to this discussion or not.
Answer 2
We indeed missed the opportunity to clarify that the scaling of urban properties are very
sensitive to the adopted definition of urban agglomeration. The allometric exponents
varies substantially depending on the the city definition based on commuting patterns
and/or density thresholds. In the present work, functional cities are assumed for the
modeling, not political ones. Following Betterments approach [10], those functional cities
are defined by mixing population.
This discussion required a more detailed treatment in the paper and to this purpose
we modified the first and second paragraphs of the section 4 (Discussion). Please, refer to
these paragraphs to see the full argument.
We also included the cited papers in the literature review and changed the seventh
paragraph of the section 1 (Introduction) to account to this question.
Comment 3
Figure 3 and Figure 4 are the same.
Answer 3
We corrected this, the figures are now different.
The simulation results are surprisingly noiseless. I wonder if the authors have run some
ensemble average. The author should also provide more details on how the results of figs.
5 and 6 were obtained. For instance, how were the values of N chosen (it seems they are
chosen from a particular range and not from a probability distribution)?
Answer 4
The points in the figures 5 and 6 are averaged values of independent samples. We used 50
samples in the figure 5 and used 30 in the figure 6. The error bars were calculated from
the standard deviation of the simulations data and they were omitted because they are
smaller than the size of the points (circles and squares) represented in the figures. Besides,
figures 5 and 6 are in log-log scale, what makes the error bars appear even smaller.
Each simulation is performed keeping N fixed. That is, the system evolves (for instance,
the numbers of amenities) in a virtual city with constant population. And the points in
these graphs are average over these simulations with the system at equilibrium. Moreover,
in the graphs of the figures 5 and 6, the population size covers some orders of magnitude
in order to observe the scaling properties.
We inserted these information in the captions of the figures 5 and 6.
Comment 5
As the authors have probably noticed, the empirical allometries have noise. In fact, for
comparing cities of different sizes researchers have employed the residuals surrounding the
scaling laws. (...) Can this model explain also explain the fluctuations surrounding the
empirical allometries? For instance, in the previous papers, researchers have found that
hese fluctuations are log-normally distributed.
Answer 5
This is a very good question. We thank the referee the opportunity to link the proposed
model to this interesting empirical observation.
We believe that the model can provide some insight into observed fluctuations in
empirical data. In fact this work helps to interpret these fluctuations from a slightly
more microscopical point of view. According to the proposed theory, if a city has a
larger (smaller) exponent, then this city is promoting better (worse) interaction between
distant individuals. In the new version of the manuscript, we argue that the log-normally
distributed empirical fluctuations of the urban indicators would be due to the diversity of
means and peculiarities of each city in promoting the spatial integration of individuals.
We introduced three new paragraphs in the subsection The Fluctuations in real data
of the section 4 (Discussions) to deal with this question.
Comment 6
I like the idea of your sentence: One way to archive greater urban development is to
ncrease the density of the cities and consequently the fractal dimension. Public policies
can be useful to archive this objective. However, the side effect of this strategy is that it can
decrease the quality of life of the citizens. On the other hand, the city development can be
mproved, according to the model, by decreasing <U+03B3>, which means increasing the interaction
range between the citizens. In practical aspects, this is achieved by creating polices able
of promoting distant individuals to interact by decreasing the cost of transportation, or
mproving and diversifying urban mobility.
model also predicts that socio-economic and environmental metrics such as crime, suicides
and carbon emissions will be enhanced in large cities. The authors could comment on
hat too. Furthermore, how the authors think a model can differentiate between this urban
metrics?
Answer 6
The referee presented a very good point here. Increasing the interactions in the city,
increase the social advantages, but also the social drawbacks.
In this paper, we worked with the hypothesis that the exponent of interaction decay,
<U+03B3>, is the same for all socio-economic and all infrastructure variables. Consequently, the
scale exponent for different social-economical variables, ßse , must be all the same. The
same is valid for the scale exponent for different infrastructure variables, ßinf ra , that must
also be all the same.
However, we believe that we can refine the model by interpreting that each socio-
economical and infrastructure variable has its own value of <U+03B3>, and consequently its own
value of ß. Lets remember that smaller values of <U+03B3> lead to greater values of ßse , according
to the result described in the paper. In this situation, it would be preferable for any given
city to have smaller values of <U+03B3> for prosperity quantities (e.g. GDP), and larger values of
<U+03B3> for disadvantages quantities (e.g. criminality and CO2 emission).
