Recently, magnetic biochar has attracted much attention for the removal of pollutants from water
due to its advantage of magnetic separation. In this study, sorptive removal of phenanthrene
from aqueous solutions using magnetic and nonmagnetic rice-husk-derived biochars was
systematically investigated. The results revealed that compared with BC, MBC had a faster
adsorption rate and higher adsorption capacity for PHE. The adsorption mechanisms of the two
biochars were discussed. In general, the manuscript has been well organized, and it can be
considered for publication after minor revision.
1. The discussion about the effect of pH is not very clear. The sentence from line 169 to line 172 is
confusing.
2. What is the advantage of the Sips model compared with the other two models?

I have read this paper very carefully, not only because of my reviewer role, but because one of
my research interests is also the application of biochar for environmental remediation. Let me say
that I liked the paper.It is well written and easily understandable. Moreover, in my opinion,
discussion and conclusions are congruent with the results and the experimental design. This is
the reason why I suggest to publish the paper in its present form

Dear Editor: This paper claimed they synthesized the magnetic biochar for absorption of PHE.
However, i did not observe any doped content of magnetism or iron in Table 1 for MBC. In
addition, the pH effect on the absorption efficiency plot mean that the magnetic has been
dissolved into water bath. I encorage the authors provide more proof on the mechanism rather to
proivde so many spectra without any meanings.

Response to Referees
Dear Editor,
We really appreciate the useful comments and suggestions from you and reviewers
on our manuscript. The reviewers’ detailed comments and suggestions are very
helpful for us to improve the quality on the manuscript. We have modified the
manuscript accordingly. The modifications of manuscript were marked RED color in
revised manuscript and detailed corrections are listed below point by point.
Reviewer: 1
Comment 1:
The discussion about the effect of pH is not very clear. The sentence from line 169 to
line 172 is confusing.
Answer: According to the suggestion, the relative descriptions were modified in line
187-211 in page 9-10 in revised manuscript.
Comment 2:
What is the advantage of the Sips model compared with the other two models?
Answer: Langmuir model was often used to simulate monolayer adsorption under the
assuming of adsorbent surface regularity. Freundlich model was applied to multilayer
adsorption based on the hypothesis of adsorbent surface irregularity. Sips model is
modified type of Freundlich models, it has wider application conditions and can be
better used to analyze the linear and nonlinear characteristics of adsorption process.
The relative description were added in line 266-271 in page 12-13 in revised
manuscript.
Reviewer: 3
Comment 1:
I did not observe any doped content of magnetism or iron in Table 1 for MBC.
Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. According to the suggestion, we have added the
content of iron for MBC in Table 1 and corresponding description in line 155 in page
7 in revised manuscript.
Comment 2:
The pH effect on the absorption efficiency plot mean that the magnetic has been
dissolved into water bath. I encorage the authors provide more proof on the
mechanism?
Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. According to the suggestion, we have modified
the section of pH effect on the adsorption and added the corresponding explanation in
line 202-211 in page 9-10 in revised manuscript and added figure 3 in revised Figure.
