This study describes an analytically solvable model of the feto-placental vascular system which
represents the blood vessels in that system as a symmetric branching network with a given
number of generations (which are later fitted to define an optimal number and an optimal
capillary radius). The aim is to find these ‘optimal parameters’. I have some concerns regarding
understanding what the model adds to the existing literature on uteroplacental oxygen transport
as few previous studies are mentioned. Also, there are some major concerns about the
physiological accuracy of the model in comparison to existing data.
1. The study is missing a discussion of where it sits in terms of other modelling studies of oxygen
transport in the placenta. The cited models of placental transport are limited to studies of blood
flow, which do neglect oxygen transport. However, there is a lot of discussion in the literature of
models that look to understand how uteroplacental structure influences ‘optimal’ exchange but
these are completely neglected here (see Serov et al. J Appl Physiol for a review
doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00543.2015). In addition, two recent studies have tried to use
computational modelling to understand how fetoplacental structure influences oxygen transport
(Mayo et al. Placenta 2016, 43:54-60 and Lin et al. J Theoet Biol 2016, 408:1-12). Thus an appraisal
of other models of maternal-fetal oxygen transport is necessary here, and also in the discussion
when considering optimality.
2. The detailed discussion of ‘bifurcation resistance’ seems unnecessary given the bifurcation
resistance is ultimately neglected. The discussion and mathematical description of the bifurcation
resistance is more suited to an appendix or supplementary material, given it is not used in the
model, with a brief justification in the paper itself.
3. The ‘excellent’ correspondence of predicted optimal branching generations in both mouse and
human is compared to selected studies only and predictions of 32 and 34 branching generations
as optimal in mouse and human respectively are high compared with morphological estimates.
Human: the Benirschke et al. (page 121, 5th addition) states that from the stem villi there are “up
to four” branching generations (rami chorii of the first to fourth orders) and then “two to 30
(mean 10) more generations of unequal dichotomous branching” .This suggests on average 14
generations of villous branching, and highly asymmetric branching. The hemodynamics of an
asymmetric tree like this would be very different to a symmetric tree with 30 generations and
would likely be better approximated by the mean number of generations. This is consistent with
Leiser et al (Leiser R, Kosanke G, Kaufmann P. 1991 Humanplacental vascularization. In Placenta:
basic researchfor clinical application (ed. H Soma). Basle,Switzerland: Karger.) and Kauffman et
al (Trophoblast Res, 1988, 3:113-137) who suggest ~11 generations of villous tree and 4-5
generations in the chorionic vessels. All this data together is in closer agreement with the
parameterisations of previous models of the fetoplacental vasculature including Guiot et al.
(Ultrasound in Med & Biol, 1992, 18:535-544) and Todros et al. (Ultrasound in Med & Biol, 1992,
18:545-551) who assumed 15 branching generations and are not mentioned in this study.
Mouse: I couldn’t find the reference to 32 branching generations in the Adamson study cited, this
3
may be an incorrect reference. Rennie et al suggested a maximum branching generation in control
mice of 23.7±1.3 near term (Biology of Reproduction, 2015 92:1-11). This would result in a
considerably reduced vasculature than 32 symmetric generations and again reflects a maximum
value in an asymmetric tree.
There is still relevance to a model of this type even if it doesn’t predict an optimal branching
generation that corresponds with the literature data, but a much wider discussion of the literature
is needed for justification, and potentially discussion as to why a sub-optimal tree may occur (e.g.
volume constraints?).
4. Based on your estimates of vessel diameter, length and number, it would be a worthwhile test
to determine what the total volume of the villous vasculature estimated from your model is,
given a symmetric 34 generation tree has many more vessels than a highly asymmetric one I am
concerned that the model could become physiological at high generations, a comparison of total
predicted vascular volume compared with morphological studies could alleviate this concern.
My estimate for the 34 generation human tree based on equations (3) and (4) is 512 ml which is
bigger than estimates for total placental volume in vivo (de Paula et al. J Ultrasound Med 2008;
27:1583–1590). Similarly, are estimates for vessel diameters/lengths at these bifurcation levels
consistent with previous studies (e.g. Leiser et al.)?
5. My calculations of df from the equation given differ from the values given. In humans N=34
and L0=0.6 m 4.85*L0/(2^((N+1)/3))=4.85*0.6/2^11.67 = 0.000895 m = 895um. Perhaps there is a
typographical error here, but these equations and values should be checked.
Minor Points:
1. A study “Clark et al. 2010” has been cited twice as a reference for umbilical artery
diameter. I think that this is a mistake as the study is a modelling study looking at lung
circulation.

Report on the manuscript "Analytical modeling of the feto-placental vasculature system of
placenta; consideration of oxygen transport"
In the manuscript, a simple engineering model of convective and diffusive resistences is
proposed to characterize the oxygen transport in the human and mouse placentas. This model
predicts the optimal number of branching levels which agrees well with the reported values: 32
levels in the mouse placenta and 34 levels in the human placenta. Some other quantities such as
volume flow rate and the feto-placental capillary diameters are as well predicted.
In spite of the importance of understanding the oxygen transport in the placenta and some
promising predictions, the proposed model is extremely over-simplified, the manuscript is rather
difficult to read, and many statements remain unjustified, as detailed below.
These reasons do not allow me to recommend the manuscript for publication.
Major points:
1) My principal argument against the present paper is that the proposed model is just a cartoon
picture of the placenta. First of all, the major assumption is that the placenta should be optimized
for oxygen transport. This claim appears as self-evident and is not even discussed. At the same
time, the placenta plays many roles simultaneously, and it is unclear whether its structure is
indeed optimized with respect to the oxygen uptake. Even for the simpler case of the lungs
(which have only the respiratory function), it was shown that their structure is optimized to
exprire CO2 and not to inspire the oxygen. The case of the human placenta is much more
complicated. Without this basic assumption, the remaining derivation of the model is not
justified.
Even if this assumption is admitted, there are many more practical points. For instance, is the
Murrey's law between consecutive diameters, Eq. (3), confirmed by histology? This was done for
lungs by Weibel et al, but I'm not aware of such confirmation in the placenta.
Further, I do not understand the argument for applying the same law to the consecutive lengths.
So, why does Eq. (4) hold?
The assumption of the symmetric feto-placenta tree is too far from the physiological reality. In
particular, the assumption that every part of capillaries receives the same diffusive flow of
oxygen is certainly false. This assumption ignores completely the fact that the maternal blood
reaches different villi in a very heterogeneous fashion, as discussed in the literature (see below).
Moreover, several fetal capillaries are often present in the same villus, and they compete for
oxygen. As a consequence, Eq. (10) cannot hold in practice.
Even if the symmetric tree is accepted as a physiological structure, why do the convective and
diffusive resistences simply add up? I would agree that these two ingredients can appear as a
linear combination in the cost function, but why their contributions are assumed to be
equivalent?
The proposed model is so drastically over-simplified (both geometrically and physically), that
claiming that
"... the unified model proposed herein is based on the geometry of the placenta vasculature tree
as well as the concentration of species..."
5
is unfair.
2) To my eyes, the minimum of the total resistence in Fig. 3a occurs at N ~ 28, not 34, as claimed
in the main text.
3) It is true that modeling of the oxygen transport in the human placenta remains rather basic and
needs significant improvements. Nevertheless, several groups have recently made notable
progress in this direction. All these modeling works (except that by Chernyavsky et al. 2010) were
ignored in the manuscript. It seems that the authors started with the idea of extending the simple
model of resistences from lungs to placenta without evaluating the current state of the art in this
field. Here is the list of several recent papers that discuss various modeling aspects of the human
placenta (in chronological order):

Plitman Mayo, Olsthoorn, Charnock-Jones, Burton, Oyen, Computational modeling of the
structure-function relationship in human placental terminal villi J. Biomech. (published online in
2016)
Ignoring all these works, the authors claim (page 1)
"However, current models have focused on modeling without considering the detail structure of
the vasculature trees and detail analysis of mass transport in the organ."
or (page 2)
"This research is novel because this is the first model that analyzes in detail the diffusive
transport in the fetal capillaries by considering the concentration of transport species."
These statements are misleading. While none of the aforementioned works provides a complete
description, they definitely attempt to provide such a detailed analysis, to discuss diffusive
6
transport, and to consider theconcentration of transport species. And most of them are based on
more realistic hypotheses than the present work.
Minor points:
1) p. 4, line 178:
I do not understand why the area includes transverse cross-sections
(the term pi d_{ft}^2/2).
2) p. 4, line 186:
Why h_{ft} = d_{ft}?
3) p. 4, lines 188-197
I do not understand these arguments
4) What is the purpose of Fig. 4 showing Eq. (15), in which the dependence on N is explicit?

The paper, motivated by feto-placental circulation, explores the design of a symmetric bifurcating
cylindrical pipe network that simultaneously minimises viscous dissipation of Poiseuille flow
and maximises the associated oxygen diffusion flux at the terminal end of the tree. The results are
an ‘optimal’ number of generations and the corresponding size of a terminal villus. There are
however multiple assumptions explicitly and implicitly made during the analysis limit the
applicability and physiological relevance of model prediction. Furthermore, the methodological
part of the paper is poorly presented and requires considerable harmonisation.
Line 28-30. Relating to the “functional relationship of mass transfer between the maternal and
fetal blood flows”; and being described as “largely unknown”. The reviewer finds this statement
a little neglectful of previous milestone publications and refers the authors to some early work,
which has come to shape the thinking of placental physiologists. Whilst this is true in vivo, there
are been extensive studies in multiple species and in the use of experimental human placental
lobule, to understand the bidirectional transfer of solute, including nutrients and xenobiotics,
including effects of flow and solute properties – early studies were performed in the sheep
(Meschia, 1967), using theoretical and experimental data; a consideration was given to “flow-
limited transfer” and “diffusional-limited transfer” of substances in many species, with
consideration being given to the relative importance of barrier histology according to molecular
properties of the analyte (Faber 1977); “multi-villous flow” and effects on transfer efficacy
(Martin Jnr 1981); ion flux accounting for blood shunts, charge and pH dependency (Stacey,
1980); the putative question of hypoxic venous constriction on fetal to maternal blood flow
matching, affecting the transplacental exchange rate (Howard, 1987; Byrne, 1987);
compartmentalised blood flow in relation to the integrative studies of amino acid transfer
(Panichob, 2016). More recent modelling of placental solute uptake from the maternal circulation,
considering the placenta as a porous medium (Chernyavsky, 2010, 2011; and fetal capillary
acquisition of oxygen considering pressure drops through capillaries accounting for sinusoids
and luminal axis length and capillary branching angiogenesis (Pearce, 2016).
The claim on page 1, line 40 of “broad morphological similarities between the human and mouse
placenta” is not particularly accurate (see for example, Carter, 2007 Placenta
doi:10.1016/j.placenta.2006.11.002): (i) the human placenta is haemomonochorial, while the
mouse one is haemotrichorial, meaning that there are two additional layers separating maternal
and fetal circulations; (ii) the multi-villous arrangement and corresponding ‘open-pool’ maternal
8
circulation in the human placenta is distinctly different from the close-circuit labyrinthine
circulation of the mouse placenta.
Line 102: Recent advances in capillary modelling with respect to oxygen transfer (Pearce, 2016;
Plitman-Mayo, 2016) suggest that “considering fetal vessels as cylindrical channels” is now an
oversimplification from the point of view of the capillary structure-function relationship. This
vital element of the vascular tree should be remodelled with respect to such recent study
intricacies.
Figure 2: Please elaborate on the importance of a complementary converging tree that feeds into
umbilical arteries, effectively doubling the conductive resistance and making it different from a
top-down airway tree. The predicted ‘optimal’ branching of 34 symmetric generations is way out
of physiological range (an immense 2^34, i.e. 11 orders of magnitude more than in the human
lung!). Moreover, the human villous tree branching is highly asymmetric (a mean of about 15
generations with a range of 6 to 34 – see Benirschke et al. (2006) Pathology of the Human
Placenta, Ch.7)
Line 239: The authors report the ”optimum bifurcation N yields 34”. There has been some
reconstruction morphology performed on human placental material at different gestational ages
(Castellucci, 1990). Figure 2 of the Castellucci paper is suggestive of circa 3 branching orders in a
9 week human placenta of the villous tree within 2500µm depth of tissue from the chorionic
plate. Accounting for placenta depths the authors are requested to test the efficacy of their
modelling of N against published morphology data.
The authors copy verbatim the methodology of Section 2 from the paper of Reis et al. (Med Phys
2004; doi:10.1118/1.1705443), which they mention in passé in the Introduction. In addition to the
lack of proper attribution, the section introduces further inaccuracies and confusion. For example,
at the line 200 on page 5, equations (5), (9) and (16) are claimed to be used, while (9) has been
estimated to have a negligible contribution earlier (lines 156-159). Furthermore, the coefficient
0.01968 in the second term of eqn. (17) does not seem to follow from 0.2/(pi*1.5*4.85) as expected
from (13) & (15) – I invite the authors to double-check this point that can affect the main result.
Instead of reproducing the results of Reis et al., I suggest to drop this section, referring to Reis et
al.’s paper and explaining the key differences that result in eqn. (17), such as (A/delta)
calculation.
Line 244-5: Refering to “optimal feto-placental diameter” as being 88µm. For the sake of the
physiologist, please be explicit, whether this has been derived for the final stage N diameter (i.e.
the fetoplacental capillary sinusoidal average), or is it a summation of all vessels within the
branching axis (all Ns)? The follow-on sentence, referring to placental stereology is suggestive of
the former, but is this correct?
The presentation requires significant improvement. Please check and define the units of all the
parameters used throughout the manuscript and avoid duplicating or ambiguous notation. The
manuscript would benefit if you introduce a nomenclature for all the symbols (and their units) in
the Appendix. For instance, on ll. 114, 153, you talk about Q_N for volumetric flow rate in m^3/s
and dot(m_0) in kg/s – neither would make the resistance unit of kg/s. Furthermore, you later
introduce dot(m_0)_ox and Q_ox (see eqns (12), (13)), which are presumably the same but in
units different to Q. Also, Q_b on line 200 is not defined. Finally, please change rho_b to rho_ox
in eqn (19).
Minor points:
22: It is difficult to understand what is meant by this.
9
Line 46: Please reference hydrostatic pressure gradients for the human and mouse. Other
differences are: The mouse has a fenestrated endothelium and only one basement membrane in
the placental barrier, whereas the human has a trophoblast, as well as an endothelial basement
membrane and a continuous endothelium (Georgiades, 2002). Also the mouse has a
haemotrichorial placenta, whereas in the human it is described as haemomonochorial (at least for
the 3rd trimester).
51: the “maternal blood basin” is traditionally referred to as the “intervillous space”
Fig 1 A: Legend needs to be elaborated to explain the significance of the arrows and the zone
depicted by the broken line.
Fig 1B: need to depict maternal blood flow wit harrows, in parity with Fig 1A.
Fig 2 A, legend, last sentence: Be clear whether “resistance” relates to resistance to flow or oxygen
transfer.
Fig 2B: diagramatic representation of villous vasculature ignores the existence of arterioles and
venules and treats the villous as having a single vessel.
All figures: Needs labelling as “A”, “B” & “C”, accordingly.Mouse and human placentas are
confused at places. E.g. line 51 on page 2: are you talking of the human placenta?
p. 2, ll. 20-24: please revise the phrase “the branching structure of the feto-placental during...” and
clarify what you mean by “in any organ”. Reis et al. 2004 presented the model identical to yours
for an airway tree.
p. 8, Table 1: change 1^-9 to 10^-9 in the diffusion coefficient.
p. 15, Fig. 2: you define the diameter as D_N in the figure (easy to confuse with the diffusion
coefficient) but later use d_n in the main text. Please harmonise.
pp. 16-17: Give the units of the resistances in Figs 3 & 4, or introduce proper dimensionless
parameters.

picture of the placenta. First of all, the major assumption is that the placenta should be optimized
for oxygen transport. This claim appears as self-evident and is not even discussed. At the same
time, the placenta plays many roles simultaneously, and it is unclear whether its structure is
indeed optimized with respect to the oxygen uptake. Even for the simpler case of the lungs
(which have only the respiratory function), it was shown that their structure is optimized to
exprire CO2 and not to inspire the oxygen. The case of the human placenta is much more
complicated. Without this basic assumption, the remaining derivation of the model is not
justified.
Even if this assumption is admitted, there are many more practical points. For instance, is the
Murrey's law between consecutive diameters, Eq. (3), confirmed by histology? This was done for
lungs by Weibel et al, but I'm not aware of such confirmation in the placenta.
Further, I do not understand the argument for applying the same law to the consecutive lengths.
So, why does Eq. (4) hold?
The assumption of the symmetric feto-placenta tree is too far from the physiological reality. In
particular, the assumption that every part of capillaries receives the same diffusive flow of
oxygen is certainly false. This assumption ignores completely the fact that the maternal blood
reaches different villi in a very heterogeneous fashion, as discussed in the literature (see below).
Moreover, several fetal capillaries are often present in the same villus, and they compete for
oxygen. As a consequence, Eq. (10) cannot hold in practice.
Even if the symmetric tree is accepted as a physiological structure, why do the convective and
diffusive resistences simply add up? I would agree that these two ingredients can appear as a
linear combination in the cost function, but why their contributions are assumed to be
equivalent?
The proposed model is so drastically over-simplified (both geometrically and physically), that
claiming that
"... the unified model proposed herein is based on the geometry of the placenta vasculature tree
as well as the concentration of species..."
13
is unfair.
2) To my eyes, the minimum of the total resistence in Fig. 3a occurs at N ~ 28, not 34, as claimed
in the main text.
3) It is true that modeling of the oxygen transport in the human placenta remains rather basic and
needs significant improvements. Nevertheless, several groups have recently made notable
progress in this direction. All these modeling works (except that by Chernyavsky et al. 2010) were
ignored in the manuscript. It seems that the authors started with the idea of extending the simple
model of resistences from lungs to placenta without evaluating the current state of the art in this
field. Here is the list of several recent papers that discuss various modeling aspects of the human
placenta (in chronological order):

structure-function relationship in human placental terminal villi J. Biomech. (published online in
2016)
Ignoring all these works, the authors claim (page 1)
"However, current models have focused on modeling without considering the detail structure of
the vasculature trees and detail analysis of mass transport in the organ."
or (page 2)
"This research is novel because this is the first model that analyzes in detail the diffusive
transport in the fetal capillaries by considering the concentration of transport species."
These statements are misleading. While none of the aforementioned works provides a complete
14
description, they definitely attempt to provide such a detailed analysis, to discuss diffusive
transport, and to consider the concentration of transport species. And most of them are based on
more realistic hypotheses than the present work.
Minor points:
1) p. 4, line 178:
I do not understand why the area includes transverse cross-sections
(the term pi d_{ft}^2/2).
2) p. 4, line 186:
Why h_{ft} = d_{ft}?
3) p. 4, lines 188-197
I do not understand these arguments
4) What is the purpose of Fig. 4 showing Eq. (15), in which the dependence on N is explicit?

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper, motivated by feto-placental circulation, explores the design of a symmetric bifurcating
cylindrical pipe network that simultaneously minimises viscous dissipation of Poiseuille flow
and maximises the associated oxygen diffusion flux at the terminal end of the tree. The results are
an ‘optimal’ number of generations and the corresponding size of a terminal villus. There are
however multiple assumptions explicitly and implicitly made during the analysis limit the
applicability and physiological relevance of model prediction. Furthermore, the methodological
part of the paper is poorly presented and requires considerable harmonisation.
Line 28-30. Relating to the “functional relationship of mass transfer between the maternal and
fetal blood flows”; and being described as “largely unknown”. The reviewer finds this statement
a little neglectful of previous milestone publications and refers the authors to some early work,
which has come to shape the thinking of placental physiologists. Whilst this is true in vivo, there
are been extensive studies in multiple species and in the use of experimental human placental
lobule, to understand the bidirectional transfer of solute, including nutrients and xenobiotics,
including effects of flow and solute properties – early studies were performed in the sheep
(Meschia, 1967), using theoretical and experimental data; a consideration was given to “flow-
limited transfer” and “diffusional-limited transfer” of substances in many species, with
consideration being given to the relative importance of barrier histology according to molecular
properties of the analyte (Faber 1977); “multi-villous flow” and effects on transfer efficacy
(Martin Jnr 1981); ion flux accounting for blood shunts, charge and pH dependency (Stacey,
1980); the putative question of hypoxic venous constriction on fetal to maternal blood flow
matching, affecting the transplacental exchange rate (Howard, 1987; Byrne, 1987);
compartmentalised blood flow in relation to the integrative studies of amino acid transfer
(Panichob, 2016). More recent modelling of placental solute uptake from the maternal circulation,
considering the placenta as a porous medium (Chernyavsky, 2010, 2011; and fetal capillary
15
acquisition of oxygen considering pressure drops through capillaries accounting for sinusoids
and luminal axis length and capillary branching angiogenesis (Pearce, 2016).
The claim on page 1, line 40 of “broad morphological similarities between the human and mouse
placenta” is not particularly accurate (see for example, Carter, 2007 Placenta
doi:10.1016/j.placenta.2006.11.002): (i) the human placenta is haemomonochorial, while the
mouse one is haemotrichorial, meaning that there are two additional layers separating maternal
and fetal circulations; (ii) the multi-villous arrangement and corresponding ‘open-pool’ maternal
circulation in the human placenta is distinctly different from the close-circuit labyrinthine
circulation of the mouse placenta.
Line 102: Recent advances in capillary modelling with respect to oxygen transfer (Pearce, 2016;
Plitman-Mayo, 2016) suggest that “considering fetal vessels as cylindrical channels” is now an
oversimplification from the point of view of the capillary structure-function relationship. This
vital element of the vascular tree should be remodelled with respect to such recent study
intricacies.
Figure 2: Please elaborate on the importance of a complementary converging tree that feeds into
umbilical arteries, effectively doubling the conductive resistance and making it different from a
top-down airway tree. The predicted ‘optimal’ branching of 34 symmetric generations is way out
of physiological range (an immense 2^34, i.e. 11 orders of magnitude more than in the human
lung!). Moreover, the human villous tree branching is highly asymmetric (a mean of about 15
generations with a range of 6 to 34 – see Benirschke et al. (2006) Pathology of the Human
Placenta, Ch.7)
Line 239: The authors report the ”optimum bifurcation N yields 34”. There has been some
reconstruction morphology performed on human placental material at different gestational ages
(Castellucci, 1990). Figure 2 of the Castellucci paper is suggestive of circa 3 branching orders in a
9 week human placenta of the villous tree within 2500µm depth of tissue from the chorionic
plate. Accounting for placenta depths the authors are requested to test the efficacy of their
modelling of N against published morphology data.
The authors copy verbatim the methodology of Section 2 from the paper of Reis et al. (Med Phys
2004; doi:10.1118/1.1705443), which they mention in passé in the Introduction. In addition to the
lack of proper attribution, the section introduces further inaccuracies and confusion. For example,
at the line 200 on page 5, equations (5), (9) and (16) are claimed to be used, while (9) has been
estimated to have a negligible contribution earlier (lines 156-159). Furthermore, the coefficient
0.01968 in the second term of eqn. (17) does not seem to follow from 0.2/(pi*1.5*4.85) as expected
from (13) & (15) – I invite the authors to double-check this point that can affect the main result.
Instead of reproducing the results of Reis et al., I suggest to drop this section, referring to Reis et
al.’s paper and explaining the key differences that result in eqn. (17), such as (A/delta)
calculation.
Line 244-5: Refering to “optimal feto-placental diameter” as being 88µm. For the sake of the
physiologist, please be explicit, whether this has been derived for the final stage N diameter (i.e.
the fetoplacental capillary sinusoidal average), or is it a summation of all vessels within the
branching axis (all Ns)? The follow-on sentence, referring to placental stereology is suggestive of
the former, but is this correct?
The presentation requires significant improvement. Please check and define the units of all the
parameters used throughout the manuscript and avoid duplicating or ambiguous notation. The
manuscript would benefit if you introduce a nomenclature for all the symbols (and their units) in
the Appendix. For instance, on ll. 114, 153, you talk about Q_N for volumetric flow rate in m^3/s
16
and dot(m_0) in kg/s – neither would make the resistance unit of kg/s. Furthermore, you later
introduce dot(m_0)_ox and Q_ox (see eqns (12), (13)), which are presumably the same but in
units different to Q. Also, Q_b on line 200 is not defined. Finally, please change rho_b to rho_ox
in eqn (19).
Minor points:
22: It is difficult to understand what is meant by this.
Line 46: Please reference hydrostatic pressure gradients for the human and mouse. Other
differences are: The mouse has a fenestrated endothelium and only one basement membrane in
the placental barrier, whereas the human has a trophoblast, as well as an endothelial basement
membrane and a continuous endothelium (Georgiades, 2002). Also the mouse has a
haemotrichorial placenta, whereas in the human it is described as haemomonochorial (at least for
the 3rd trimester).
51: the “maternal blood basin” is traditionally referred to as the “intervillous space”
Fig 1 A: Legend needs to be elaborated to explain the significance of the arrows and the zone
depicted by the broken line.
Fig 1B: need to depict maternal blood flow wit harrows, in parity with Fig 1A.
Fig 2 A, legend, last sentence: Be clear whether “resistance” relates to resistance to flow or oxygen
transfer.
Fig 2B: diagramatic representation of villous vasculature ignores the existence of arterioles and
venules and treats the villous as having a single vessel.
All figures: Needs labelling as “A”, “B” & “C”, accordingly.Mouse and human placentas are
confused at places. E.g. line 51 on page 2: are you talking of the human placenta?
p. 2, ll. 20-24: please revise the phrase “the branching structure of the feto-placental during...” and
clarify what you mean by “in any organ”. Reis et al. 2004 presented the model identical to yours
for an airway tree.
p. 8, Table 1: change 1^-9 to 10^-9 in the diffusion coefficient.
p. 15, Fig. 2: you define the diameter as D_N in the figure (easy to confuse with the diffusion
coefficient) but later use d_n in the main text. Please harmonise.
pp. 16-17: Give the units of the resistances in Figs 3 & 4, or introduce proper dimensionless
parameters.
Line 284: Assumption #1 is difficult to understand and needs rewording.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
The authors have made significant changes to this manuscript and some improvements.
However, some reviewer concerns have not been fully addressed and require more discussion, in
particular the question of optimality and this models predictions in the context of known
structural and functional aspects of placental physiology.
1. The assumption/hypothesis that the placenta functions optimally
In response to the previous reviews the assumption that the placenta functions optimally has
been reiterated and strengthened. While it is certainly valid to use a model like this to predict the
‘optimal structural configuration’ this must be placed carefully in the context of other evidence
for and against optimality in placental structure. Taking into account comments by myself and
other reviewers, this assumption is certainly debatable. The discussion portion of the manuscript
is short and there is space for discussion on ‘optimality’. The question of optimality for oxygen
exchange in the placenta has been addressed by several theoretical studies, and there is
significant discussion in the literature on the lung (another gas exchange organ) on whether it
functions optimally which could be drawn upon in this context. Key points include:
a. Is there a balance between optimality and robustness? Your model predicts ‘optimal’ branching
generations as shown in Figure 3 to be similar, but high compared to the number of generations
suggested by anatomic studies. It would be useful to highlight his comparison on your graphs by
including indication of the average and range of branching generations in normal and human
placentas. If we accept that the predicted number of branching generations is optimal, then it is
useful to investigate whether this optimal physiological structure is competing with other factors
(resistance to blood flow, space/volume constraints). An example of this type of argument is
given in the lung literature (Mauroy et al. Nature 427, 633-636). I suggest that additional figures
showing 1) the predicted resistance to blood flow vs branching generation. It is noted that this
increases linearly but this metric can be compared to known values of resistance (umbilical artery
18
pressure-venous pressure/volumetric flow) to determine whether there is some maximum
feasible N, and 2) volume of the feto-placental vascular tree vs number of branching generations
(which can be compared to typical placental volumes in the literature). Is there some balance
between size, vascular resistance and volume which might determine vascular structure that
influences ‘optimality’?
b. Number of branching generations vs capillary size. The estimates of ‘optimal capillary size’ do
not compare well with the literature. Is it the case that one can predict a number of branching
generations that compares well with known structures, or a capillary size and produce an
‘optimal’ placenta, but not both? Is there a way that this relationship could be illustrated?
c. Other contributors to efficiency. Placental efficiency is determined by many factors, some of
which necessarily not included in this model. Some placement of your results in the context of
these other suggestions of contributors to efficiency would benefit the discussion. E.g. the balance
between maternal and fetal blood flow rates, the relative direction of maternal and fetal flow
rates, heterogeneity in structure, is optimality in O2 transfer lost to improve optimality in other
nutrients.
2. Introduction: The introduction has been reworded with reference to several clinical,
experimental and modelling studies. However, the multiple changes have resulted in a somewhat
confusing introductory section. I suggest a reordering to first focus on previous works
(experimental and theoretical) with a focus on how these works relate to efficiency of the
placenta. Then to introduce your modeling study and its aims (small parts of information on your
model have currently become mixed with discussion of previous work which distracts from the
focus of the introduction.
Page 1 Line 45: “Clinical and anatomical studies of the placenta revealed that its efficiency was
determined by the structure of the vasculature…” Needs references
Page 1 Line 48: “Numerous studies have shown that analytical and computational
models…”Needs references
Page 2 line 87, page 3 line 121: Clark et al 2010 is not a model of the placenta and does not
measure (or mention) umbilical artery diameters.
3. Page 4 lines 196-201 appears to justify not using a cylindrical approximation to the capillary
shape. While this assumption is necessary in a model of this type, this comparison may be better
placed as a model limitation.

Report on the revised manuscript "Analytical modeling of the feto-placental vasculature system
of the placenta: consideration of oxygen transport"
Thanks to the impressive work of four reviewers who essentially prepared the bibliography and
corrected numerous errors, the manuscript has been improved. Nevertheless, my original
opinion about the very incremental contribution, which is far from the physiological reality of
the placenta, has not changed. Without re-discussing many disputable (and doubtful)
assumptions of this work, it is enough to consider one of the author's conclusion on page 6, line
280: the optimal diameter of the feto-placental capillary, d_{ft}, is estimated to be 2 cm. In the
next phrase, the author discretely states that the measured values are from 30 to 80 microns.
THEY ARE A THOUSAND TIMES SMALLER! The physiological relevance of the whole model
ends here, in spite of "predictions" of the optimal nomber of bifurcation levels, which, after
tuning the parameters, took a more realistic value of 19 instead of earlier suggested 34. Other
problems are less impressive and more specific (see the first report).
Apart from these conceptual deficiencies (many relevant points in the first report that remained
unanswered), the whole text requires significant improvements.
1) For instance, there are a lot of redundancies, e.g,
lines 87-88:
"However, prior works have not evaluated the optimal structure of the feto-placental vasculature
network with respect to oxygen transport, which is the focus of this study"
linse 96-97 (i.e., just several lines below):
"... the optimal structure of the feto-placental vasculature network regarding oxygen transport
has not been calculated before."
2) Some notations are still confusing, e.g., Eq. (5)
R^b_{conv}(N) = sum_{n=0}^N R^_{conv}(n) ...
does not make sense.
3) Some claims are inaccurate, e.g., writing log(R_{total}^{ox}) = 12.12 on line 267 does not make
sense because R_{total}^{ox} is a dimensional quantity.
4) Finally, there are typos or misprints, i.e., the Murrey's paper was published in 1926, not in
1962.
In overall, it is unclear why the thorough editing work is not done properly by the author but it
was re-delegated to reviewers.

Major Corrections
The author reuses a significant portion of the methodology from the paper of Reis et al. 2004 Med
Phys. I strongly recommend to state upfront at the beginning (before “As assumed...” on line 118)
something along the lines of: “Below we follow the approach of Reis et al. 2004; Bejan & Lorente
2006”.
In Results (lines 255-259) I do not see the actual formula used for calculating optimal N. It would
benefit the reader if you provide local sensitivity analysis for the optimal N and d with respect to
key model parameters.
Also, on line 267, Rox is given in Pa*s/m^3, while log(Rox) appears dimensionless. Please
remove this inconsistency by either introducing an appropriate reference value (Rox / Rox_ref)
before taking the log, or by plotting the dimensional y-axis in Fig. 3 on a logarithmic scale.
Finally, there is strong feeling of overstating the degree of physiological applicability of model’s
predictions (in view of enormous number of strong assumptions and simplifications made). The
proposed model is by construction qualitative and not quantitative, and it should be clearly
positioned as such. I suggest to create a special subsection 4.3 Model Limitations, which will
include lines 322-337, but also needs to be expanded (see specific comments below). In particular,
I would avoid using the term “conservative mathematical model” (see line 363), since a large
number of oversimplifications does not warrant a robust result (or lower / upper limit of any
sort).
After addressing these points, the manuscript could be recommended for publication.
Minor points:
Page 4, lines 164-6: add value a= 80 for human and 1 for mouse in Table 1.
Page 6, line 246: By assuming the oxygenation value for umbilical vein is identical to feto-
placental capillary you neglect the whole villous venous tree and placental metabolism that could
have a profound effect on oxygen transfer. Please make it clear in Model Limitations section (see
above).
Lines 285-6: why do you use mouse placenta to explain the discrepancy in the predictions for the
human placenta (namely, a predicted ‘optimal’ villous capillary diameter of 2 cm, which is off by
two orders of magnitude)?
Page 8, line 362: change “ideal” to “idealized”
Line 263: replace “conservative” with “qualitative, rather than quantitative,”
Page 11, line 502: add “Clark A” after “Tawhai MH” to the list of co-authors.
Fig. 4: While Figs 1 and 3 describe human (A) and mouse (B) placentas, both panels in Fig. 4 are
for the mouse. An electron micrograph for the human placenta would be useful here. Did you
seek permissions to reproduce the micrographs? Then state “adapted with permission from...”
Appendix: change D to d for diameter.
The Martin Jnr reference added to the manuscript is the wrong one, but the reviewer wrongly
22
provided the wrong year of publication; the full reference is “Martin CB Jr. (1965) UTERINE
BLOOD FLOW AND PLACENTAL CIRCULATION. Anesthesiology. 1965 Jul-Aug;26:447-59”.
Also for the Byrne reference, which should be “Byrne BM, Howard RB, Morrow RJ, Whiteley KJ,

Line 60 (formerly line 46) References still need to be provided in relation to concentration and
hydrostatic pressure differentials between fetal and maternal plasma (point 3).

other reviewers, this assumption is certainly debatable. The discussion portion of the manuscript
is short and there is space for discussion on ‘optimality’. The question of optimality for oxygen
exchange in the placenta has been addressed by several theoretical studies, and there is
significant discussion in the literature on the lung (another gas exchange organ) on whether it
functions optimally which could be drawn upon in this context. Key points include:
a. Is there a balance between optimality and robustness? Your model predicts ‘optimal’
branching generations as shown in Figure 3 to be similar, but high compared to the number of
generations suggested by anatomic studies. It would be useful to highlight his comparison on
your graphs by including indication of the average and range of branching generations in normal
and human placentas. If we accept that the predicted number of branching generations is
optimal, then it is useful to investigate whether this optimal physiological structure is competing
with other factors (resistance to blood flow, space/volume constraints). An example of this type
of argument is given in the lung literature (Mauroy et al. Nature 427, 633-636). I suggest that
additional figures showing 1) the predicted resistance to blood flow vs branching generation. It is
noted that this increases linearly but this metric can be compared to known values of resistance
(umbilical artery pressure-venous pressure/volumetric flow) to determine whether there is some
maximum feasible N, and 2) volume of the feto-placental vascular tree vs number of branching
generations (which can be compared to typical placental volumes in the literature). Is there some
balance between size, vascular resistance and volume which might determine vascular structure
that influences ‘optimality’?
b. Number of branching generations vs capillary size. The estimates of ‘optimal capillary size’ do
not compare well with the literature. Is it the case that one can predict a number of branching
generations that compares well with known structures, or a capillary size and produce an
‘optimal’ placenta, but not both? Is there a way that this relationship could be illustrated?
c. Other contributors to efficiency. Placental efficiency is determined by many factors, some of
which necessarily not included in this model. Some placement of your results in the context of
these other suggestions of contributors to efficiency would benefit the discussion. E.g. the balance
25
between maternal and fetal blood flow rates, the relative direction of maternal and fetal flow
rates, heterogeneity in structure, is optimality in O2 transfer lost to improve optimality in other
nutrients.
2. Introduction: The introduction has been reworded with reference to several clinical,
experimental and modelling studies. However, the multiple changes have resulted in a somewhat
confusing introductory section. I suggest a reordering to first focus on previous works
(experimental and theoretical) with a focus on how these works relate to efficiency of the
placenta. Then to introduce your modeling study and its aims (small parts of information on your
model have currently become mixed with discussion of previous work which distracts from the
focus of the introduction.
Page 1 Line 45: “Clinical and anatomical studies of the placenta revealed that its efficiency was
determined by the structure of the vasculature…” Needs references
Page 1 Line 48: “Numerous studies have shown that analytical and computational
models…”Needs references
Page 2 line 87, page 3 line 121: Clark et al 2010 is not a model of the placenta and does not
measure (or mention) umbilical artery diameters.
3. Page 4 lines 196-201 appears to justify not using a cylindrical approximation to the capillary
shape. While this assumption is necessary in a model of this type, this comparison may be better
placed as a model limitation.

Comments to the Author(s)
Major Corrections
The author reuses a significant portion of the methodology from the paper of Reis et al. 2004 Med
Phys. I strongly recommend to state upfront at the beginning (before “As assumed...” on line 118)
something along the lines of: “Below we follow the approach of Reis et al. 2004; Bejan & Lorente
2006”.
In Results (lines 255-259) I do not see the actual formula used for calculating optimal N. It would
benefit the reader if you provide local sensitivity analysis for the optimal N and d with respect to
key model parameters.
Also, on line 267, Rox is given in Pa*s/m^3, while log(Rox) appears dimensionless. Please
remove this inconsistency by either introducing an appropriate reference value (Rox / Rox_ref)
before taking the log, or by plotting the dimensional y-axis in Fig. 3 on a logarithmic scale.
Finally, there is strong feeling of overstating the degree of physiological applicability of model’s
predictions (in view of enormous number of strong assumptions and simplifications made). The
proposed model is by construction qualitative and not quantitative, and it should be clearly
positioned as such. I suggest to create a special subsection 4.3 Model Limitations, which will
include lines 322-337, but also needs to be expanded (see specific comments below). In particular,
I would avoid using the term “conservative mathematical model” (see line 363), since a large
number of oversimplifications does not warrant a robust result (or lower / upper limit of any
sort).
After addressing these points, the manuscript could be recommended for publication.
Minor points:
26
Page 4, lines 164-6: add value a= 80 for human and 1 for mouse in Table 1.
Page 6, line 246: By assuming the oxygenation value for umbilical vein is identical to feto-
placental capillary you neglect the whole villous venous tree and placental metabolism that could
have a profound effect on oxygen transfer. Please make it clear in Model Limitations section (see
above).
Lines 285-6: why do you use mouse placenta to explain the discrepancy in the predictions for the
human placenta (namely, a predicted ‘optimal’ villous capillary diameter of 2 cm, which is off by
two orders of magnitude)?
Page 8, line 362: change “ideal” to “idealized”
Line 263: replace “conservative” with “qualitative, rather than quantitative,”
Page 11, line 502: add “Clark A” after “Tawhai MH” to the list of co-authors.
Fig. 4: While Figs 1 and 3 describe human (A) and mouse (B) placentas, both panels in Fig. 4 are
for the mouse. An electron micrograph for the human placenta would be useful here. Did you
seek permissions to reproduce the micrographs? Then state “adapted with permission from...”
Appendix: change D to d for diameter.
The Martin Jnr reference added to the manuscript is the wrong one, but the reviewer wrongly
provided the wrong year of publication; the full reference is “Martin CB Jr. (1965) UTERINE
BLOOD FLOW AND PLACENTAL CIRCULATION. Anesthesiology. 1965 Jul-Aug;26:447-59”.
Also for the Byrne reference, which should be “Byrne BM, Howard RB, Morrow RJ, Whiteley KJ,
Adamson SL. (1997) Role of the L-arginine nitric oxide pathway in hypoxic fetoplacental
vasoconstriction. Placenta. 1997 Nov;18(8):627-34.”
Line 60 (formerly line 46) References still need to be provided in relation to concentration and
hydrostatic pressure differentials between fetal and maternal plasma (point 3).

With the revised version of the paper, further results and analysis have been added.
Unfortunately, in some places this leads to additional somewhat contradictory comparisons to
literature data, which in places weakens the message of the paper. The model itself, while
structurally simplified does potentially add relevant new information on placental exchange as it
aims to bridge the gap between umbilical cord and placental capillaries. However, an analysis, as
suggested by myself and other reviewers, of the impacts of model parameters is needed to
overcome the apparent mismatch in model predictions and experimental data. As it stands the
article appears to attempt to explain away discrepancies, which could be explained more
rationally by expected variation in parameter values.
I believe that rather than focusing on a single set of parameters, and proposing analysis of these
parameters belongs in future studies, \the paper would greatly benefit by providing a list of all
model parameters (of which there are not a large number) and assessing the impact of each on
predictions. It concerns me that with each revision of this manuscript the ‘optimal’ tree structure
appears to have been adjusted, which suggests that the model may be sensitive to its
parameterization. This is not necessarily a negative to the model, but needs to be presented
pragmatically to allow (e.g.) a clear suggestion of what could be improved in experimental
studies and/or what variation in fetoplacental structure might impact function the most. Some
specific comments follow:
1. Page 6 lines 237-9 is beta the number of capillaries or villous trees? It looks to me that it would
more properly be the number of fetal capillaries per terminal villous as the number of 2^N is the
total number of conductive vessels arising from the umbilical cord by my understanding of the
model, not per villous tree as I understand from the previous description of the model. If this is
the case is 60 really an appropriate number?
28
2. In the human model the ‘optimal’ flow rate in the capillary is defined as 25.13 ml/min. Is this
the total volume flow rate of oxygen? This certainly doesn’t make a great deal of sense as a
volume flow rate of blood as one would expect volumetric flow through the umbilical cord to be
~250ml/min up to 500 ml/min by the Gordon citation you give, which we could split into 2^18
capillaries and each capillary would receive a lot less than 25ml/min of blood. How then could
the flow rate of oxygen (or blood) be so high?
3. The discrepancy in fetal capillary diameter seems to arise from use of Murray’s law to describe
the size of the vessels with generation, presumably if the rate of change of vessel diameter was
greater, then a reasonable capillary diameter would be achieved with fewer bifurcations. While I
can accept that Murrays law makes it straightforward to solve a model analytically, I suspect
there may be evidence to suggest another simple ‘generation vs size’ law could also be used
(simply another constant number instead of 2^(1/3) as a diameter This would change other
predictions of ‘optimality’, but presumably would increase resistance of the system and
potentially worsen other predictions. Again an analysis of the sensitivity of model to parameters
would elucidate this.
Clark et al 2010 is still cited incorrectly (e.g. page 4 line 163), I don't think it is relevant at all to the
paper.

I think the changes made by the author have improved the manuscript. I have some final
comments about the changes made.
1) In response to the previous review, the authors have added text (lines 121-123) explaining that
the convective resistance is only considered in the vascular network and the diffusive resistance
29
only in the capillaries. I think this is a major assumption that still does not receive enough
attention in the manuscript. It should be made explicitly clear in these lines that all convective
resistances in the capillaries are ignored. Both of these assumptions should also be highlighted in
Section 4.3 (Model Limitations).
2) I think there is not enough attention given in the conclusion to the limitations of the work. The
authors still have not made it clear in the conclusions that, although in the work an optimal
number of bifurcations is found, there are many reasons why this result may not be appropriate
in an actual placenta (e.g. the major assumptions of the model, the fact that the placenta is not
necessarily optimal for oxygen transfer etc...).
If these comments are dealt with I think the paper is suitable for publication.

Appendix A
General comments:
The paper aims to calculate the optimal branching structure with respect to oxygen
transport of feto-placental vessels in the human and the mouse placenta. The feto-
placental vascular network is assumed to consist of vessels branching dichotomously;
the ratio of daughter to parent radius and length is imposed at each branch using values
from the literature. Other physical parameters are also taken from the literature for
the human and the mouse placenta. The optimal value of the number of bifurcations
N is calculated by minimising the total convective plus diffusive resistance to oxygen
transfer.
I think the manuscript contains results that could be useful to the community,
despite not being particularly novel. The optimal structure of a feto-placental vascular
network with respect to oxygen transport has not been calculated previously. However,
the paper essentially repeats the analysis of Reis et al [1], in which the aim was to
find the optimal number of bifurcations in the lungs. As far as I can tell, the only
difference between equation (19) in the current manuscript and equation (19) in the
Reis paper is in the values of the parameters. If the manuscript is to be published, I
think it would need to be made much more obvious in the introduction and in section
2, where the analysis is performed, that this is the case; currently, the Reis paper is
not referenced in section 2 or section 4, where the result (19) is stated.
I also have some concerns about the assumptions and results; in particular, it seems
that a different capillary network is used to calculate the diffusive resistance (section
2.1.2) as to calculate the convective resistance (section 2.1.1). There are also some
assumptions made in these sections that I’m not sure are realistic (and which would
be relatively easy to change to be more physiological). More details of these issues are
given in the specific comments below.
Overall, I think the manuscript could be published in Royal Society Open Science,
as the optimal structure of the feto-placental capillary network with respect to
oxygen transport has not previously been calculated. However, I think significant
improvements need to be made to ensure that the reliance of the paper on the
analysis of Reis et al is made explicitly clear, and that the assumptions and results
are physiologically relevant.
Finally, I think the manuscript could be written much more clearly and would
benefit from a thorough proof read.
Specific comments:
1. In the introduction, the authors state that this is the first model that “analyzes
in detail the diffusive transport in the fetal capillaries”. I think here the recent
papers by Mayo et al [2] and Pearce et al [3] should be referenced, both of which
directly calculated the diffusive transport of oxygen from the maternal blood to
the fetal capillaries in sections of the human placenta.
2. Section 2.1.2 is confusing. It appears that the authors are recreating the lung
1
analysis in Reis et al of spherical alveolar sacs, but in this case with cylindrical
fetal capillaries. As far as I understand, the overall network is assumed to consist
of a) a network of vessels with convective resistance but no diffusive resistance
(section 2.1.1) connected to b) a network of capillaries with diffusive resistance
but no convective resistance (section 2.1.2).
If the convective resistance of the capillaries from section 2.1.2 is ignored in
section 2.1.1, and the diffusive resistance of the vessels from 2.1.1. is ignored
in section 2.1.2, this should be made more clear. Could the affect of such
an assumption be investigated by calculating the diffusive resistance over the
network used in section 2.1.1 and the convective resistance over the network in
section 2.1.2?
I don’t think it is clear whether it is indeed assumed that there are two networks
connected to each other, or whether it is assumed that there are two totally
separate networks, one for the calculation of diffusive resistance and one for the
calculation of convective resistance. I think the assumptions made here need to
be stated much more clearly and physiologically justified.
3. Where do the authors obtain the relationship giving the thickness of the pla-
cental barrier to be roughly 0.2 multiplied by the diameter of the feto-placental
capillary?
4. It appears that, just after equation (13), the authors assume that the diameter
of a feto-placental capillary (df t ) is equal to its length. Can this be justified
physiologically?
5. I think some more checks could be performed to ensure that the results make
physical sense. For example, the authors state that the optimal value of df t is
88 microns. This seems like a very large diameter for a feto-placental capillary;
it may be the optimal result, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it is the actual
physiological value. It also seems to disagree with the assumption of Murray’s
Law with an umbilical artery of diameter 0.004m, which would lead to capillaries
of smaller diameter than 88 microns at the 32nd level (where 32 is the optimal
number of bifurcations calculated for a human). This seems to be another issue
with the different networks used in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.
6. It appears that equation (19) is a general result for humans or mice and that the
results for the specific types are given a few paragraphs afterwards. I think that
throughout the paper it can be quite confusing whether the parameters and the
results are referring to the human or the mouse. It should be made much more
explicit when parameters or results are stated whether they relate to the human
or the mouse placenta, or both. Perhaps the human and mouse results could be
discussed in separate sections.

Dear Dr. Dunn,
The author would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. We are pleased
that the reviewers find the work interesting, and that it provides a step forward in
analyzing the mouse placenta and in the future, human placenta. We have modified the
manuscript in line with the reviewers’ comments and address in some detail below their
comments. The changes are marked in yellow.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This study describes an analytically solvable model of the feto-placental vascular
system which represents the blood vessels in that system as a symmetric branching
network with a given number of generations (which are later fitted to define an
optimal number and an optimal capillary radius). The aim is to find these ‘optimal
parameters’. I have some concerns regarding understanding what the model adds to
the existing literature on uteroplacental oxygen transport as few previous studies
are mentioned. Also, there are some major concerns about the physiological
accuracy of the model in comparison to existing data.
1. The study is missing a discussion of where it sits in terms of other modelling
studies of oxygen transport in the placenta. The cited models of placental transport
are limited to studies of blood flow, which do neglect oxygen transport. However,
there is a lot of discussion in the literature of models that look to understand how
uteroplacental structure influences ‘optimal’ exchange but these are completely
neglected here (see Serov et al. J Appl Physiol for a review
doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00543.2015). In addition, two recent studies have tried to
use computational modelling to understand how fetoplacental structure influences
oxygen transport (Mayo et al. Placenta 2016, 43:54-60 and Lin et al. J Theoet Biol
2016, 408:1-12). Thus an appraisal of other models of maternal-fetal oxygen
transport is necessary here, and also in the discussion when considering optimality.
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The suggested articles by the reviewer as well as
some other new papers related to the maternal-fetal oxygen transport have been added to
the introduction section (please see page 1 and 2 in the manuscript).
2. The detailed discussion of ‘bifurcation resistance’ seems unnecessary given the
bifurcation resistance is ultimately neglected. The discussion and mathematical
description of the bifurcation resistance is more suited to an appendix or
supplementary material, given it is not used in the model, with a brief justification
in the paper itself.
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The detailed discussion of “bifurcation
resistance”, to a similar case for lung, has been defined in (Reis et al. 2004). Thus, in the
current manuscript the methodology to define the bifurcation resistance has been referred
1
to the paper by Reis et al. 2004 and a summary of the bifurcation resistance following
with the corresponding values for the human and mouse placentas has been mentioned in
the manuscript (please see page 4 lines 166-177).
3. The ‘excellent’ correspondence of predicted optimal branching generations in
both mouse and human is compared to selected studies only and predictions of 32
and 34 branching generations as optimal in mouse and human respectively are high
compared with morphological estimates.
Human: the Benirschke et al. (page 121, 5th addition) states that from the stem villi
there are “up to four” branching generations (rami chorii of the first to fourth
orders) and then “two to 30 (mean 10) more generations of unequal dichotomous
branching”. This suggests on average 14 generations of villous branching, and
highly asymmetric branching. The hemodynamics of an asymmetric tree like this
would be very different to a symmetric tree with 30 generations and would likely be
better approximated by the mean number of generations. This is consistent with
Leiser et al (Leiser R, Kosanke G, Kaufmann P. 1991 Humanplacental
vascularization. In Placenta: basic research for clinical application (ed. H Soma).
Basle,Switzerland: Karger.) and Kauffman et al (Trophoblast Res, 1988, 3:113-137)
who suggest ~11 generations of villous tree and 4-5 generations in the chorionic
vessels. All this data together is in closer agreement with the parameterisations of
previous models of the fetoplacental vasculature including Guiot et al. (Ultrasound
in Med & Biol, 1992, 18:535-544) and Todros et al. (Ultrasound in Med & Biol,
1992, 18:545-551) who assumed 15 branching generations and are not mentioned in
this study.
Mouse: I couldn’t find the reference to 32 branching generations in the Adamson
study cited, this may be an incorrect reference. Rennie et al suggested a maximum
branching generation in control mice of 23.7±1.3 near term (Biology of
Reproduction, 2015 92:1-11). This would result in a considerably reduced
vasculature than 32 symmetric generations and again reflects a maximum value in
an asymmetric tree.
There is still relevance to a model of this type even if it doesn’t predict an optimal
branching generation that corresponds with the literature data, but a much wider
discussion of the literature is needed for justification, and potentially discussion as
to why a sub-optimal tree may occur (e.g. volume constraints?).
We thank the reviewer for the comment and suggestions. We have done a complete
literature review that corresponds to the generation and branching structure of both
human and mouse placentas by considering the literatures have been suggested perfectly
by the reviewer. After checking all the calculations, we have compared the value of
“optimal branching generations” for both human and mouse placentas with the
corresponding values defined in these literatures and we found a good agreement (please
see pages 6 and 7 sections 4.1 and 4.2).
4. Based on your estimates of vessel diameter, length and number, it would be a
worthwhile test to determine what the total volume of the villous vasculature
estimated from your model is, given a symmetric 34 generation tree has many more
2
vessels than a highly asymmetric one I am concerned that the model could become
physiological at high generations, a comparison of total predicted vascular volume
compared with morphological studies could alleviate this concern. My estimate for
the 34 generation human tree based on equations (3) and (4) is 512 ml which is
bigger than estimates for total placental volume in vivo (de Paula et al. J Ultrasound
Med 2008; 27:1583–1590). Similarly, are estimates for vessel diameters/lengths at
these bifurcation levels consistent with previous studies (e.g. Leiser et al.)?
We apologize for the confusion. The author hope that understands the reviewer comment
clearly. As suggested by the reviewer we have checked the calculations and have defined
the total optimal placental volume more than 512 ml. However, considering that the
values defined in eq. (3) and (4) are the optimal values it is expected that the total
placental volume become different than predicted values in vivo. Detailed discussion in
terms of comparison between the predicted and experimental values have been shown in
Section 4 pages 6 and 7.
5. My calculations of df from the equation given differ from the values given. In
humans N=34 and L0=0.6 m 4.85*L0/(2^((N+1)/3))=4.85*0.6/2^11.67 = 0.000895 m
= 895um. Perhaps there is a typographical error here, but these equations and
values should be checked.
We apologize for this error. We have check all the calculations and fixed this error in the
text (please see pages 6 and 7 in Section 4).
Minor Points:
1. A study “Clark et al. 2010” has been cited twice as a reference for umbilical
artery diameter. I think that this is a mistake as the study is a modelling study
looking at lung circulation.
We apologize for this error. We have fixed this error in the text.

Comments to the Author(s)
Report on the manuscript "Analytical modeling of the feto-placental vasculature
system of placenta; consideration of oxygen transport"
In the manuscript, a simple engineering model of convective and diffusive
resistences is proposed to characterize the oxygen transport in the human and
mouse placentas. This model predicts the optimal number of branching levels which
agrees well with the reported values: 32 levels in the mouse placenta and 34 levels in
the human placenta. Some other quantities such as volume flow rate and the feto-
placental capillary diameters are as well predicted. In spite of the importance of
understanding the oxygen transport in the placenta and some promising
predictions, the proposed model is extremely over-simplified, the manuscript is
rather difficult to read, and many statements remain unjustified, as detailed below.
3
These reasons do not allow me to recommend the manuscript for publication.
1) My principal argument against the present paper is that the proposed model is
just a cartoon picture of the placenta. First of all, the major assumption is that the
placenta should be optimized for oxygen transport. This claim appears as self-
evident and is not even discussed. At the same time, the placenta plays many roles
simultaneously, and it is unclear whether its structure is indeed optimized with
respect to the oxygen uptake. Even for the simpler case of the lungs (which have
only the respiratory function), it was shown that their structure is optimized to
exprire CO2 and not to inspire the oxygen. The case of the human placenta is much
more complicated. Without this basic assumption, the remaining derivation of the
model is not justified.
Even if this assumption is admitted, there are many more practical points. For
instance, is the Murrey's law between consecutive diameters, Eq. (3), confirmed by
histology? This was done for lungs by Weibel et al, but I'm not aware of such
confirmation in the placenta.
Further, I do not understand the argument for applying the same law to the
consecutive lengths. So, why does Eq. (4) hold?
The assumption of the symmetric feto-placenta tree is too far from the physiological
reality. In particular, the assumption that every part of capillaries receives the same
diffusive flow of oxygen is certainly false. This assumption ignores completely the
fact that the maternal blood reaches different villi in a very heterogeneous fashion,
as discussed in the literature (see below). Moreover, several fetal capillaries are
often present in the same villus, and they compete for oxygen. As a consequence, Eq.
(10) cannot hold in practice.
Even if the symmetric tree is accepted as a physiological structure, why do the
convective and diffusive resistences simply add up? I would agree that these two
ingredients can appear as a linear combination in the cost function, but why their
contributions are assumed to be equivalent?
The proposed model is so drastically over-simplified (both geometrically and
physically), that claiming that "... the unified model proposed herein is based on the
geometry of the placenta vasculature tree as well as the concentration of species..."
is unfair.
We apologize for the confusion and we agree with the reviewer regarding the
assumptions and simplifications of our method. The aim of this work was to create a
conservative model that includes the important mechanisms and parameters related to the
fetal blood flow in the placenta from a fluid dynamics point of view as well as defining
the optimal branching structure in the placenta.
As suggested by the reviewer, the major assumption is that the placenta should be
optimized for oxygen transport and feto-placenta is a symmetric tree structure. This
statement has been emphasized in the manuscript (please see page 2 in the manuscript).
The Murray's law between consecutive diameters (i.e., Eq. (3)), has been defined based
on an assumption that oxygen transport was done for lungs by Weibel et al. (as
4
mentioned by the reviewer). Even though the placenta is much more complicated than
lung since the structures are in some cases similar, we assumed the same consecutive
lengths through the vasculature system in placenta. We plan to investigate the Murray's
law between consecutive diameters for placenta in future.
Eq. (4) has been described in detail in page 116 of the book by Bejan and Lorente 2008.
We have also added this statement in the manuscript.
In the theoretical modeling since a quasi-steady resistance model between fetal and
maternal blood flow have been considered; therefore, we assumed that every part of
capillaries receives the same diffusive flow of oxygen. This assumption does not ignore
the fact that the maternal blood reaches different villi in a very heterogeneous fashion,
but because diffusion resistance increases linearly with number of bifurcation level and
convective resistance decreases linearly with the bifurcation level (please see eq. (10))
considering different portion of diffuse resistance in eq. (10) does not alter the results.
In addition, in the theoretical modeling the convective and diffusive resistances simply
add up and their contributions are assumed to be equivalent because of considering one-
dimensional quasi-steady of the resistances over the vasculature system. In this model we
considered that the overall network of the vasculature system consists of two different
resistances; 1) convective resistance through the vessels, and 2) diffusive resistance over
the capillaries. These statements have been added in the text.
We have also rephrased the statement of "... the unified model proposed herein is based
on the geometry of the placenta vasculature tree as well as the concentration of species..."
and emphasized on the optimal analysis of the feto-placental vasculature system as has
been commented by the reviewer.
2) To my eyes, the minimum of the total resistance in Fig. 3a occurs at N ~ 28, not
34, as claimed in the main text.
We apologize for this confusion. We have checked our calculations and we have fixed
this value as well as the graph in the manuscript (please see pages 6 and 7 in Section 4).
3) It is true that modeling of the oxygen transport in the human placenta remains
rather basic and needs significant improvements. Nevertheless, several groups have
recently made notable progress in this direction. All these modeling works (except
that by Chernyavsky et al. 2010) were ignored in the manuscript. It seems that the
authors started with the idea of extending the simple model of resistences from
lungs to placenta without evaluating the current state of the art in this field. Here is
the list of several recent papers that discuss various modeling aspects of the human
placenta (in chronological order):
Gill, Salafia, Grebenkov, Vvedensky, Modeling oxygen transport in human
placental terminal villi, J. Theor. Biol. 291, 33-41 (2011)...
Plitman Mayo, Olsthoorn, Charnock-Jones, Burton, Oyen, Computational modeling
of the structure-function relationship in human placental terminal villi J. Biomech.

(published online in 2016). Ignoring all these works, the authors claim (page 1)
"However, current models have focused on modeling without considering the detail
structure of the vasculature trees and detail analysis of mass transport in the
organ."or (page 2) "This research is novel because this is the first model that
analyzes in detail the diffusive transport in the fetal capillaries by considering the
concentration of transport species." These statements are misleading. While none of
the aforementioned works provides a complete description, they definitely attempt
to provide such a detailed analysis, to discuss diffusive transport, and to consider
the concentration of transport species. And most of them are based on more realistic
hypotheses than the present work.
We apologize for inadequate introduction section. We have done a complete literature
review by considering the suggested literatures by the reviewer (please see the
introduction section in pages 1 and 2).
Minor points:
1) p. 4, line 178: I do not understand why the area includes transverse cross-sections
(the term pi d_{ft}^2/2).
We apologize for the confusion. This value is the area of cylinder and has been defined
by considering that the length and diameter of the capillaries are the same. This has been
explained in more detail in the manuscript (please see page 4 line 196-201).
2) p. 4, line 186: Why h_{ft} = d_{ft}?
We apologize for the confusion. First, we have considered that the fetal capillaries have a
cylindrical shape. In order to simplify the model and because the shape of the fetal
capillaries as mentioned by literatures such as Pearce 2016 and Plitman-Mayo 2016 are
not exactly cylinder. We later assumed that the diameter and the length of the fetal
capillaries are the same (please see page 4 line 196-201).
3) p. 4, lines 188-197 I do not understand these arguments
We apologize for the confusion. The details of these discussions have been described in
the book by Bejan and Lorente 2008 and the paper by Reis et al. 2004. The author has
been rephrased these arguments for clarification.
4) What is the purpose of Fig. 4 showing Eq. (15), in which the dependence on N is
explicit?
This figure has been shown to compare the optimal values using the current model with
the corresponding experimental data in the literatures. This statement has been added in
the text and Fig. 4 has been deleted.
Reviewer 3
The paper aims to calculate the optimal branching structure with respect to oxygen
transport of feto-placental vessels in the human and the mouse placenta. The feto-
placental vascular network is assumed to consist of vessels branching
dichotomously; the ratio of daughter to parent radius and length is imposed at each
6
branch using values from the literature. Other physical parameters are also taken
from the literature for the human and the mouse placenta. The optimal value of the
number of bifurcations N is calculated by minimising the total convective plus
diffusive resistance to oxygen transfer.
I think the manuscript contains results that could be useful to the community,
despite not being particularly novel. The optimal structure of a feto-placental
vascular network with respect to oxygen transport has not been calculated
previously. However, the paper essentially repeats the analysis of Reis et al [1], in
which the aim was to find the optimal number of bifurcations in the lungs. As far as
I can tell, the only difference between equation (19) in the current manuscript and
equation (19) in the Reis paper is in the values of the parameters. If the manuscript
is to be published, I think it would need to be made much more obvious in the
introduction and in section 2, where the analysis is performed, that this is the case;
currently, the Reis paper is not referenced in section 2 or section 4, where the result
(19) is stated.
I also have some concerns about the assumptions and results; in particular, it seems
that a different capillary network is used to calculate the diffusive resistance (section
2.1.2) as to calculate the convective resistance (section 2.1.1). There are also some
assumptions made in these sections that I’m not sure are realistic (and which would
be relatively easy to change to be more physiological). More details of these issues
are given in the specific comments below.
Overall, I think the manuscript could be published in Royal Society Open Science,
as the optimal structure of the feto-placental capillary network with respect to
oxygen transport has not previously been calculated. However, I think significant
improvements need to be made to ensure that the reliance of the paper on the
analysis of Reis et al is made explicitly clear, and that the assumptions and results
are physiologically relevant.
Finally, I think the manuscript could be written much more clearly and would
benefit from a thorough proof read.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. The current manuscript has been restructured,
the corresponding statements have been rephrased, and all the calculations have been
checked accordingly. Please see follows.
Specific comments:
1. In the introduction, the authors state that this is the first model that
“analyzes in detail the diffusive transport in the fetal capillaries”. I think
here the recent papers by Mayo et al [2] and Pearce et al [3] should be
referenced, both of which directly calculated the diffusive transport of
oxygen from the maternal blood to the fetal capillaries in sections of the
human placenta.
We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have done a complete literature review and
have added the literatures as well as the papers mentioned by the reviewer in the current
manuscript. Please see the introduction section.
2. Section 2.1.2 is confusing. It appears that the authors are recreating the lung
analysis in Reis et al of spherical alveolar sacs, but in this case with
7
cylindrical fetal capillaries. As far as I understand, the overall network is
assumed to consist of a) a network of vessels with convective resistance but
no diffusive resistance (section 2.1.1) connected to b) a network of capillaries
with diffusive resistance but no convective resistance (section 2.1.2).
We apologize for the confusion. The theoretical model is based on a quasi-steady analysis
of resistances between fetal and maternal blood flow and oxygen transport. The overall
network, as mentioned by the reviewer, consist of a network of vessels with convective
resistance but no diffusive resistance connected to a network of capillaries with diffusive
resistance but no convective resistance. These statements have been added in the current
manuscript.
3. If the convective resistance of the capillaries from section 2.1.2 is ignored in
section 2.1.1, and the diffusive resistance of the vessels from 2.1.1. is ignored
in section 2.1.2, this should be made more clear. Could the affect of such an
assumption be investigated by calculating the diffusive resistance over the
network used in section 2.1.1 and the convective resistance over the network
in section 2.1.2?
We apologize for unclear statements in the text. The statements suggested by the
reviewer have been clearly mentioned in the manuscript. We plan to examine the addition
of the diffusive resistance over the network of the vessels as well as the effect of
convective resistance in fetal capillaries in future.
4. I don’t think it is clear whether it is indeed assumed that there are two
networks connected to each other, or whether it is assumed that there are
two totally separate networks, one for the calculation of diffusive resistance
and one for the calculation of convective resistance. I think the assumptions
made here need to be stated much more clearly and physiologically justified.
The quasi-steady model over the network of airway trees has been reported in detail by
Reis et al. 2004. To describe a model for placenta in section 2.1, we have referred to this
paper. We also have clearly mentioned in the manuscript that it is assumed there are two
totally separate networks, one for the calculation of diffusive resistance and one for the
calculation of convective resistance.
5. Where do the authors obtain the relationship giving the thickness of the pla-
cental barrier to be roughly 0.2 multiplied by the diameter of the feto-
placental capillary?
We thank the reviewer for the comment. Because we could not find any literature to show
explicitly the relationship between the diameter of the feto-placental capillary and the
thickness of the placental barrier, we have considered the placental barrier thickness to be
around 0.2 of the fetal capillary diameter similar to the thickness of the tissue in lung.
6. It appears that, just after equation (13), the authors assume that the diameter
of a feto-placental capillary (dft) is equal to its length. Can this be justified
physiologically?
We apologize for the confusion. Because in reality the feto-placental capillary is not
cylinder and in order to simplify the related equations, we have assumed the length and
8
the diameter of the fetal capillary are equal (please see section 2.1 and Figure 2). These
statements have been added in the manuscript clearly (please see line 196-201).
7. I think some more checks could be performed to ensure that the results make
physical sense. For example, the authors state that the optimal value of dft is
88 microns. This seems like a very large diameter for a feto-placental
capillary; it may be the optimal result, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it is
the actual physiological value. It also seems to disagree with the assumption
of Murray’s Law with an umbilical artery of diameter 0.004m, which would
lead to capillaries of smaller diameter than 88 microns at the 32nd level
(where 32 is the optimal number of bifurcations calculated for a human).
This seems to be another issue with the different networks used in sections
2.1.1 and 2.1.2.
We apologize for unclear statement in the text. The author has checked all the
calculations and the corresponding results. The value of bifurcation level and the
corresponding value for the optimal diameter and length of both human placenta and
mouse has been defined. As mentioned by the reviewer these values are the optimal
results, that doesn’t necessarily mean it is the actual physiological value. However, we
have compared them with the average value for the diameter of the feto-placental
vasculature system wherever it was possible. The details have been reported in sections
4.1 and 4.1, pages 6 and 7.
8. It appears that equation (19) is a general result for humans or mice and that
the results for the specific types are given a few paragraphs afterwards. I
think that throughout the paper it can be quite confusing whether the
parameters and the results are referring to the human or the mouse. It
should be made much more explicit when parameters or results are stated
whether they relate to the human or the mouse placenta, or both. Perhaps
the human and mouse results could be discussed in separate sections.
We apologize for the confusion and agree with the reviewer. We have restructured the
manuscript according to the reviewers’ comments (please see pages 6 and 7).

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper, motivated by feto-placental circulation, explores the design of a
symmetric bifurcating cylindrical pipe network that simultaneously minimizes
viscous dissipation of Poiseuille flow and maximises the associated oxygen diffusion
9
flux at the terminal end of the tree. The results are an ‘optimal’ number of
generations and the corresponding size of a terminal villus. There are however
multiple assumptions explicitly and implicitly made during the analysis limit the
applicability and physiological relevance of model prediction. Furthermore, the
methodological part of the paper is poorly presented and requires considerable
harmonisation.
Line 28-30. Relating to the “functional relationship of mass transfer between the
maternal and fetal blood flows”; and being described as “largely unknown”. The
reviewer finds this statement a little neglectful of previous milestone publications
and refers the authors to some early work, which has come to shape the thinking of
placental physiologists. Whilst this is true in vivo, there are been extensive studies in
multiple species and in the use of experimental human placental lobule, to
understand the bidirectional transfer of solute, including nutrients and xenobiotics,
including effects of flow and solute properties – early studies were performed in the
sheep (Meschia, 1967), using theoretical and experimental data; a consideration was
given to “flow-limited transfer” and “diffusional limited transfer” of substances in
many species, with consideration being given to the relative importance of barrier
histology according to molecular properties of the analyte (Faber 1977); “multi-
villous flow” and effects on transfer efficacy (Martin Jnr 1981); ion flux accounting
for blood shunts, charge and pH dependency (Stacey, 1980); the putative question of
hypoxic venous constriction on fetal to maternal blood flow matching, affecting the
transplacental exchange rate (Howard, 1987; Byrne, 1987); compartmentalised
blood flow in relation to the integrative studies of amino acid transfer (Panichob,
2016). More recent modelling of placental solute uptake from the maternal
circulation, considering the placenta as a porous medium (Chernyavsky, 2010, 2011;
and fetal capillary acquisition of oxygen considering pressure drops through
capillaries accounting for sinusoids and luminal axis length and capillary branching
angiogenesis (Pearce, 2016).
We thank the reviewer for the comments and suggestions. We have renewed the
introduction section by adding the previous and early works in the feto-placenta field.
The claim on page 1, line 40 of “broad morphological similarities between the
human and mouse placenta” is not particularly accurate (see for example, Carter,
2007 Placenta doi:10.1016/j.placenta.2006.11.002): (i) the human placenta is
haemomonochorial, while the mouse one is haemotrichorial, meaning that there are
two additional layers separating maternal and fetal circulations; (ii) the multi-
villous arrangement and corresponding ‘open-pool’ maternal circulation in the
human placenta is distinctly different from the close-circuit labyrinthine circulation
of the mouse placenta.
We agree with the reviewers and thank for the comments. These details in terms of the
differences and similarities between the human and mouse placentas has been added in
the manuscript (please see page 2).
Line 102: Recent advances in capillary modelling with respect to oxygen transfer
(Pearce, 2016; Plitman-Mayo, 2016) suggest that “considering fetal vessels as
cylindrical channels” is now an oversimplification from the point of view of the
10
capillary structure-function relationship. This vital element of the vascular tree
should be remodelled with respect to such recent study intricacies.
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The model in the current manuscript has
considered the fetal capillaries as cylindrical channels, then it has been simplified
considering recent advances in capillary modeling (as mentioned by the reviewer) by
assuming equality between the length and diameter of the fetal capillaries. It is proposed
this model can be used as a conservative model to define the optimized bifurcation level
in the feto-placental vasculature system.
Figure 2: Please elaborate on the importance of a complementary converging tree
that feeds into umbilical arteries, effectively doubling the conductive resistance and
making it different from a top-down airway tree.
We apologize for the confusion and thank for the comment. The current model is based
on the assumption of a symmetrical vasculature system. Considering asymmetrical
structures by adding additional conductive tree is the focus of our future investigation.
However, in the current manuscript we have analyzed a new model by deliberating the
number of cotyledons in the human placenta in order to elaborate the theoretical model
and make it closer to the real structure (Please see page 4 lines 164-166).
The predicted ‘optimal’ branching of 34 symmetric generations is way out of
physiological range (an immense 2^34, i.e. 11 orders of magnitude more than in the
human lung!). Moreover, the human villous tree branching is highly asymmetric (a
mean of about 15 generations with a range of 6 to 34 – see Benirschke et al. (2006)
Pathology of the Human Placenta, Ch.7)
We agree with the reviewers and apologize for the confusion. The model and the
calculations have been completely checked. The number of bifurcation levels in both
human and mouse placentas (i.e., 19 and 18 in human and mouse placentas) has been
compared with current literatures and wherever possible some of the morphological
structures have been compared with the experimental data in the literatures.
Line 239: The authors report the ”optimum bifurcation N yields 34”. There has
been some reconstruction morphology performed on human placental material at
different gestational ages (Castellucci, 1990). Figure 2 of the Castellucci paper is
suggestive of circa 3 branching orders in a 9 week human placenta of the villous tree
within 2500µm depth of tissue from the chorionic plate. Accounting for placenta
depths the authors are requested to test the efficacy of their modelling of N against
published morphology data.).
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The author hope that understands the reviewer
comment clearly. We have compared the number of bifurcation level N against the
literature by Castellucci 1990 and some related literatures (please see section 4.1 and
page 6).
The authors copy verbatim the methodology of Section 2 from the paper of Reis et
al. (Med Phys 2004; doi:10.1118/1.1705443), which they mention in passé in the
Introduction. In addition to the lack of proper attribution, the section introduces
further inaccuracies and confusion. For example, at the line 200 on page 5,
11
equations (5), (9) and (16) are claimed to be used, while (9) has been estimated to
have a negligible contribution earlier (lines 156-159).
We apologize for the error. The current manuscript has been reorganized and accordingly
the inaccuracies have been deleted. The methodology of this manuscript is similar to the
paper by Reis et al. 2004 that was defined for lung, but there are some differences that
makes the paper unique for the placenta.
Furthermore, the coefficient 0.01968 in the second term of eqn. (17) does not seem to
follow from 0.2/(pi*1.5*4.85) as expected from (13) & (15) – I invite the authors to
double-check this point that can affect the main result.
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The current manuscript has been restructured
and all the calculations as well as the results have been checked accordingly (please see
pages 6 and 7 in section 4).
Instead of reproducing the results of Reis et al., I suggest to drop this section,
referring to Reis et al.’s paper and explaining the key differences that result in eqn.
(17), such as (A/delta) calculation.
We agree with the reviewer comment. The current manuscript has been considered these
comments into account and the key differences between this manuscript and the paper by
Reis et al. 2004 has been emphasized.
Line 244-5: Refering to “optimal feto-placental diameter” as being 88µm. For the
sake of the physiologist, please be explicit, whether this has been derived for the
final stage N diameter (i.e. the fetoplacental capillary sinusoidal average), or is it a
summation of all vessels within the branching axis (all Ns)? The follow-on sentence,
referring to placental stereology is suggestive of the former, but is this correct?
We apologize for the confusion in terms of explanation of the feto-placental diameter.
These calculations as well as the value of “optimal feto-placental diameter” have been
revisited in the current manuscript. This value, as mentioned, is the “optimal feto-
placental diameter”. We have compared the average value reported for the experimental
measurements with this optimal diameter predicted using our model. Therefore, as
expected it should be different compare to the experimental data.
The presentation requires significant improvement. Please check and define the
units of all the parameters used throughout the manuscript and avoid duplicating or
ambiguous notation. The manuscript would benefit if you introduce a nomenclature
for all the symbols (and their units) in the Appendix. For instance, on ll. 114, 153,
you talk about Q_N for volumetric flow rate in m^3/s and dot(m_0) in kg/s – neither
would make the resistance unit of kg/s. Furthermore, you later introduce
dot(m_0)_ox and Q_ox (see eqns (12), (13)), which are presumably the same but in
units different to Q. Also, Q_b on line 200 is not defined. Finally, please change
rho_b to rho_ox in eqn (19).
We apologize for any confusion regarding the parameters and their units. A nomenclature
for all the symbols as well as their units has been added in the Appendix as suggested by
the reviewer to avoid duplicating or ambiguous notation.

We apologize for the confusion. The statement has been rephrased in the manuscript

Line 46: Please reference hydrostatic pressure gradients for the human and mouse.
Other differences are: The mouse has a fenestrated endothelium and only one
basement membrane in the placental barrier, whereas the human has a trophoblast,
as well as an endothelial basement membrane and a continuous endothelium
(Georgiades, 2002). Also the mouse has a haemotrichorial placenta, whereas in the
human it is described as haemomonochorial (at least for the 3rd trimester).
We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We have added these statements in the current
manuscript (please see page 2 line 68).

Appendix C
General comments:
I do not think the authors have provided satisfactory answers to the comments
in my first review about the analysis in the paper; in my opinion, the manuscript
still requires major revision before it will be suitable for publication. To summarize,
I think the reliance of the analysis on Reis et al (2004) is still not made explic-
itly clear and I still have several problems with the assumptions and results. I think
the article would still benefit from a thorough proof read. Specific comments are below.
Specific comments:
1. I think any similarities and differences with the model of Reis et al need to be
made clear at the beginning of section 2.1. As I mentioned in my initial review,
the only difference as far as I can see is that Reis et al consider 2N spherical
alveolar sacs in the lungs at the end of the bifurcation network, while the current
paper considers cylindrical capillaries.
2. In point 2 of their reply, the authors state that they have added statements
explaining the model, which (as far as I understand) consists of calculating the
convective resistance of a network with 2N bifurcations, followed by calculating
the diffusive resistance of 2N capillaries attached to the end of the network. I
do not see these statements at the beginning of section 2.1 and I think it still
needs to be explained more clearly at the beginning of section 2.1 that this is
how the model works.
3. In point 3 (about the convective resistance of the fetal capillaries and the diffusive
resistance of the vessel network), the authors state that “the statements suggested
by the reviewer have been clearly mentioned in the manuscript”. I cannot find
these statements and I still see no mention of the fact that the convective
resistance of the capillaries has been ignored. This is a major assumption that
needs to be examined or at least mentioned in the text.
4. In point 4, the authors state that they “have clearly mentioned in the manuscript
that it is assumed there are two totally separate networks, one for the calculation
of diffusive resistance and one for the calculation of convective resistance.” I
cannot find this stated explicitly in the text. I think it should be mentioned at
the beginning of section 2.1 to avoid confusion.
5. In point 6, the authors have not satisfactorily answered my question about their
assumption that the diameter of a fetal capillary is equal to its length. Perhaps
a better way of describing this part of the model is that they are using a lumped
model to describe a network of fetal capillaries with a single effective length and
diameter, since I don’t think it’s realistic that the diameter of a fetal capillary
is equal to its length, or indeed that there is only a single capillary at the end
of each branch in the network through which diffusion takes place. Either way,
1
there should be some physiological justification given in the paper for the choice
of the capillary diameter.
6. In the quote given in point 7, I asked whether 88 µm was too large for the
diameter of a fetal capillary. In the updated manuscript this value has changed
to 2 cm. Is this a typographical error? It cannot be physiological because,
as stated by the authors on line 281 of the paper, the typical diameter of a
feto-placental capillary is of the order of magnitude of µm, not cm. The authors
have also not replied to my point about the discrepancy between the vessel
diameter predicted by Murray’s Law at the N th bifurcation, and the capillary
diameter used in the model.

Appendix D
Dear Editor of the Royal Society-Open Science,
The author would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful comments. I have
modified the manuscript in line with the reviewers’ comments and have addressed their
comments in detail below. The changes are marked in blue in the current manuscript.
Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have made significant changes to this manuscript and some
improvements. However, some reviewer concerns have not been fully addressed and
require more discussion, in particular the question of optimality and this models
predictions in the context of known structural and functional aspects of placental
physiology.
The author thanks the reviewer for more explanation and apologizes that the reviewer’s
concerns have been missed in the previous manuscript. The constructive comments
provided by this reviewer have truly helped the author to improve the quality of the
paper. I have revised the manuscript in line with the reviewer’s comments and have
addressed in some detail below his/her comments. The changes are highlighted in blue in
the manuscript. The author has clarified the question of optimality in the proposed model
with more discussion as follows.
1. The assumption/hypothesis that the placenta functions optimally
In response to the previous reviews the assumption that the placenta functions
optimally has been reiterated and strengthened. While it is certainly valid to use a
model like this to predict the ‘optimal structural configuration,’ this must be placed
carefully in the context of other evidence for and against optimality in placental
structure. Taking into account comments by myself and other reviewers, this
assumption is certainly debatable. The discussion portion of the manuscript is short
and there is space for discussion on ‘optimality’. The question of optimality for
oxygen exchange in the placenta has been addressed by several theoretical studies,
and there is significant discussion in the literature on on whether the lung (another
gas exchange organ) functions optimally which could be drawn upon in this context.
Key points include:
a. Is there a balance between optimality and robustness? Your model predicts
‘optimal’ branching generations as shown in Figure 3 to be similar, but high
compared to the number of generations suggested by anatomic studies. It
would be useful to highlight his comparison on your graphs by including
indication of the average and range of branching generations in normal and
human placentas. If we accept that the predicted number of branching
1
generations is optimal, then it is useful to investigate whether this optimal
physiological structure is competing with other factors (resistance to blood
flow, space/volume constraints). An example of this type of argument is given
in the lung literature (Mauroy et al. Nature 427, 633-636). I suggest that
additional figures showing 1) the predicted resistance to blood flow vs
branching generation. It is noted that this increases linearly but this metric
can be compared to known values of resistance (umbilical artery pressure-
venous pressure/volumetric flow) to determine whether there is some
maximum feasible N, and 2) volume of the feto-placental vascular tree vs
number of branching generations (which can be compared to typical
placental volumes in the literature). Is there some balance between size,
vascular resistance and volume which might determine vascular structure
that influences ‘optimality’?
The author agrees with the reviewer that it is valid to use a model like the one proposed
in this work to predict the ‘optimal structural configuration’. However, as suggested by
the reviewer, this must be placed in the context of other evidence for and against
optimality in placental structure. I apologize for the confusion if this point was not clear
in the original manuscript.
It should be emphasized that the focus of this study is on the structure of the feto-
placental vasculature tree, highlighting that the placental vasculature system is basically a
fluid tree, which starts at the umbilical artery and bifurcates in average around 15 times
as reported by previous researchers [Guiot et al. 1992] before reaching the terminal villi.
To the best of the author’s knowledge, the reason for the existence of 15 bifurcations in
the feto-placental vasculature tree has remained unexplained in the literature; thus, we
expect this paper has taken steps towards this explanation. Herein, we have addressed the
question whether this special flow architecture has been developed by chance or it
represents the optimum (maximum) structure for the placenta’s purpose regarding both
oxygenation and nutritientation of the fetal blood, We have used the view that the
Constructal Principle, originally developed for engineered systems, holds also for living
systems. The principle then can guide us in finding the best airflow architecture for the
respiratory system. A similar approach has been done for the lung [Reis et al. 2004].
However, there are distinctions between the two models as described at the beginning of
the Section 2.1 in detail.
The author has also read the paper by (Mauroy et al. Nature 427, 633-636) in the lung
literature. Therefore, the question of whether there is a balance between the optimality
and the robustness has been left for future work. It is expected that the results presented
in the current manuscript can be used as a first step to further elaborate the model and
address the “optimality” in the placenta.
The reviewer has also suggested to draw two graphs using the proposed model; 1) the
predicted resistance to blood flow vs branching generation, and 2) volume of the feto-
placental vascular tree vs number of branching generations (which can be compared to
typical placental volumes in the literature). The first plot has been redrawn and explained
in detail in Fig. 3 in the current manuscript. Figure 3 shows the values of resistance
2
versus bifurcation level (generation) and wherever possible the data have been compared
with the experimentally measured values. Fig. X (below figure) shows the values of
volume of the feto-placental vasculature tree versus bifurcation level and its comparison
with the experimentally measured values. It appears that the measured volume will occur
at a bifurcation level (N) which is less than 10.
Fig. X. Variation of the placental volume (cm3) versus number of bifurcation level (N)
and its comparison with the measured mean placental volume(i.e., 83 cm3) as reported by
[De Paula 2008].
b. Number of branching generations vs capillary size. The estimates of ‘optimal
capillary size’ do not compare well with the literature. Is it the case that one
can predict a number of branching generations that compares well with
known structures, or a capillary size and produce an ‘optimal’ placenta, but
not both? Is there a way that this relationship could be illustrated?
The author apologizes for the confusion. While this graph has been deleted in the current
manuscript, to define the capillary size, we used eq. (6). By having the properties of the
placenta and the optimum (maximum) value of bifurcation N, we defined the capillary
size. In the current manuscript, Fig. 4 A, B show the variation of the capillary size versus
the number of branching generations and its compassion with experimental data wherever
possible. We called this value an “optimal” capillary size because we have used N value
which was obtained as a maximum number by minimizing eq. (9).
To answer the reviewer question; using the proposed model, one can predict the number
of branching generations that compare well with the known structure. Therefore, using
Fig. 4 and having the number of generations, one can define the diameter of the fetal
capillary.
c. Other contributors to efficiency. Placental efficiency is determined by many
factors, some of which necessarily not included in this model. Some placement of
your results in the context of these other suggestions of contributors to efficiency
would benefit the discussion. E.g. the balance between maternal and fetal blood flow
rates, the relative direction of maternal and fetal flow rates, heterogeneity in
3
structure, is optimality in O2 transfer lost to improve optimality in other nutrients.
We agree with the reviewer that placental efficiency is determined by many factors and
these are not included in our proposed model. As has been mentioned in the discussion,
the proposed model neglected the heterogeneity in structure, the balance between
maternal and fetal blood flow rate and consideration of nutrients exchange between the
fetal and maternal blood flow. We again emphasize that the premise of the present study
is on the structure of the feto-placental vasculature tree. It is expected that this model
could be elaborated upon so that the suggested contributions could be added in future
investigations. Consequently, the effect of the predicted results to efficiency such as 1)
the balance between maternal and fetal blood flow rates, 2) the relative direction of
maternal and fetal flow rates, 3) heterogeneity in structure, 4) its optimality in O2 transfer
will be analyzed in the future work.
2. Introduction: The introduction has been reworded with reference to several
clinical, experimental and modelling studies. However, the multiple changes have
resulted in a somewhat confusing introductory section. I suggest a reordering to
first focus on previous works (experimental and theoretical) with a focus on how
these works relate to efficiency of the placenta. Then to introduce your modeling
study and its aims (small parts of information on your model have currently become
mixed with discussion of previous work which distracts from the focus of the
introduction.
We apologize for the confusion. The author carefully revised and corrected the
introduction section. As suggested by the reviewer we have reordered the previous and
current studies, then compared those findings with the the current manuscript. Comments
in this regard were added to the revised manuscript. Please see pages 1, 2.
Page 1 Line 45: “Clinical and anatomical studies of the placenta revealed that its
efficiency was determined by the structure of the vasculature…” Needs references
We have added a reference for this sentence. Please see line 50-52 in page 1.
Page 1 Line 48: “Numerous studies have shown that analytical and computational
models…”Needs references
We have rephrased this sentence and the related paragraph according to the reviewer’s
suggestion by referring to the specific numerical and analytical models. Please see lines
61-74 in page 2.
Page 2 line 87, page 3 line 121: Clark et al 2010 is not a model of the placenta and
does not measure (or mention) umbilical artery diameters.
I apologize for this error. I have fixed this error in the current manuscript.
3. Page 4 lines 196-201 appears to justify not using a cylindrical approximation to
the capillary shape. While this assumption is necessary in a model of this type, this
comparison may be better placed as a model limitation.
I apologize for this error. This error has been fixed in the current manuscript.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Report on the revised manuscript "Analytical modeling of the feto-placental
vasculature system of the placenta: consideration of oxygen transport"
Thanks to the impressive work of four reviewers who essentially prepared the
bibliography and corrected numerous errors, the manuscript has been improved.
Nevertheless, my original opinion about the very incremental contribution, which is
far from the physiological reality of the placenta, has not changed. Without re-
discussing many disputable (and doubtful) assumptions of this work, it is enough to
consider one of the author's conclusion on page 6, line 280: the optimal diameter of
the feto-placental capillary, d_{ft}, is estimated to be 2 cm. In the next phrase, the
author discretely states that the measured values are from 30 to 80 microns. THEY
ARE A THOUSAND TIMES SMALLER! The physiological relevance of the whole
model ends here, in spite of "predictions" of the optimal number of bifurcation
levels, which, after tuning the parameters, took a more realistic value of 19 instead
of earlier suggested 34. Other problems are less impressive and more specific (see
the first report).
Apart from these conceptual deficiencies (many relevant points in the first report
that remained unanswered), the whole text requires significant improvements.
The author apologizes for the confusion and agrees with the reviewer regarding the
assumptions and simplifications of our method. It should be emphasized that the aim of
this work is to create a model that includes the important mechanisms and parameters
related to the fetal blood flow in the placenta from a fluid dynamics point of view as well
as defining the maximum branching structure in the placenta which leads to the easiest
flow in the system.
The current manuscript has been extensively improved by addressing the reviewer’s
comments as well as adding some values to the model for instance the number of villous
trees and the number of cotyledons in analytical models. Herein, the optimal diameter of
the feto-placental capillary has been estimated to be 300 microns which is still higher
compared to the measured values of around 30 to 80 microns as reported by (Benirschke
and Kaufmann 1990; Mayhew et al. 2004; Mayhew 2009; Castellucci et al. 1990). The
discrepancy between the predicted optimal value and the measured value of fetal
capillary diameter could be an effect of our idealized model and of the assumptions used
to derive the model, as has been discussed in detail in Section “4.3. Model limitations”. I
have also discussed the assumptions of the model and have emphasized the advantages of
the proposed model despite its limitations and have proposed ideas for future work.
We will refer the reviewer to the book by Bijan and a paper by Bijan 2008 in support of
the use of the “Constructal law.” They have proposed a constructal law to map the living
5
system onto the engineering system. Here, we used a similar approach to understand the
structure of the placenta. In addition, in detail we emphasized the advantages of the
model even though it is simplified and how we can elaborate on this model to obtain a
more realistic model which to the best of our knowledge would be the first of its kind.
1) For instance, there are a lot of redundancies, e.g, lines 87-88:
"However, prior works have not evaluated the optimal structure of the feto-
placental vasculature network with respect to oxygen transport, which is the focus
of this study" lines 96-97 (i.e., just several lines below):"... the optimal structure of
the feto-placental vasculature network regarding oxygen transport has not been
calculated before."
I apologize for this confusion and error. The author has revised, checked, and corrected
the introduction section. Please see the introduction section pages 1 and 2.
2) Some notations are still confusing, e.g., Eq. (5) R^b_{conv}(N) = sum_{n=0}^N
R^_{conv}(n) ... does not make sense.
The author apologizes for this confusion. We added more explanation in the manuscript
to properly introduce the equation. This equation specifies that the total convective
resistance through the channels is the summation of all the channels’ resistances by
considering 2N number of fetal blood flow paths (channels). Please see page 5.
3) Some claims are inaccurate, e.g., writing log(R_{total}^{ox}) = 12.12 on line 267
does not make sense because R_{total}^{ox} is a dimensional quantity.
The author agrees with the reviewer’s comment and applogizes for this error.
R_{total}^{ox} has units of either Pa.s/m3 or kg.s/m3 but log(R_{total}^{ox}) is
dimensionless. Please see Fig. 3 for the correct units.
4) Finally, there are typos or misprints, i.e., the Murrey's paper was published in
1926, not in 1962.
I apologize for this error. We have entirely proofread and corrected the typos and
misprints in the current manuscript. Please see page 5 lines 181-187.
In overall, it is unclear why the thorough editing work is not done properly by the
author but it was re-delegated to reviewers.
The author apologizes for the confusion. In the current manuscript, the reviewer’s
comments have been throughly edited.

General comments:
I do not think the authors have provided satisfactory answers to the comments in
my first review about the analysis in the paper; in my opinion, the manuscript still
requires major revision before it will be suitable for publication. To summarize, I
think the reliance of the analysis on Reis et al (2004) is still not made explicitly clear
and I still have several problems with the assumptions and results. I think the article
would still benefit from a thorough proof read. Specific comments are below.
The author thanks the reviewer for the comments and aplogizes for missing the points
mentioned by this reviewer in the previous submission. The current manuscript has been
restructured, the corresponding statements have been rephrased, and all the calculations
have been checked accordingly. Please see following replies to your comments.
Specific comments:
1. I think any similarities and differences with the model of Reis et al need to be
made clear at the beginning of section 2.1. As I mentioned in my initial
review, the only difference as far as I can see is that Reis et al consider 2N
spherical alveolar sacs in the lungs at the end of the bifurcation network,
while the current paper considers cylindrical capillaries.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. It should be emphasized that this manuscript
has a lot of differences compared to the paper by Reis et al. 2004 as there are a lot of
differences between lung and placenta and how these organs function. We have used the
same approach reported by Reis et al. 2004 (i.e., Constructal Law) as a combination of
convective and diffusive resistances to define the structure of the placenta. However,
since in the placenta we have the exchange of the oxygen between the fetal and maternal
blood, 1) we have extensively contributed different methods to define the exact value of
oxygen concentration in the fetal blood to determine the concentration of oxygen in the
fetal blood (please see page 7 the Section “3. Concentration of oxygen dissolved in fetal
blood plasma and bound to hemoglobin”), 2) we have explicitly compared the
experimental results with the analytical predictions to define if there would be any
optimal (maxium) values, 3) the proposed model considers the number of cotyledons and
fetal capillaries, 4) we have also stated how we can use the model in comparison with the
published experimental data to define the parameters that are hard to measure
experimentally, and 5) even though the fetal capillaries are very complicated, we
assumed they are cyllinderical capillaries while the alveolar sacs have been considered
spherical. To the best of the author’s knowledge, these are all new in comparison to the
paper by Reis et al 2004.
The following statements have been added to the manuscript (please also see page 3
Section 2.1). “A similar approach has been used by Reis et al. 2004 to define the
characteristics of the alveolar sacs in the lungs. However there are some distinctions
between our proposed model and their model including: 1) The method to define the
7
diffusive flux resistance in the vasculature system, 2) the calculation, in detail, using the
Hill’s equation and experimental parameters, of the concentration of oxygen dissolved in
the fetal blood plasma and bound to hemoglobin, 3) the number of cotyledons and the
number of fetal capillaries in both human and mouse placenta, 4) some differences in the
structure of the alveolar sac and fetal capillaries. Wherever possible, we have also
analyzed and compared out theoretical results with the experimental data.”
2. In point 2 of their reply, the authors state that they have added statements
explaining the model, which (as far as I understand) consists of calculating the
convective resistance of a network with 2N bifurcations, followed by calculating the
diffusive resistance of 2N capillaries attached to the end of the network. I do not see
these statements at the beginning of section 2.1 and I think it still needs to be
explained more clearly at the beginning of section 2.1 that this is how the model
works.
We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and apologize if it was not clear in the previous
manuscript. Please see the statements in lines 121 and 123 in pages 7.
3. In point 3 (about the convective resistance of the fetal capillaries and the diffusive
resistance of the vessel network), the authors state that “the statements suggested by
the reviewer have been clearly mentioned in the manuscript”. I cannot find these
statements and I still see no mention of the fact that the convective resistance of the
capillaries has been ignored. This is a major assumption that needs to be examined
or at least mentioned in the text.
We thank the reviewer for the clarification of the question and apologize that it was not
clear in the preivous manuscript. The proposed model is a combination of convective
resistances through the fetal vasculature trees where the diffusion resistances have been
applied only through the fetal capillaries. The following statement has been stated in the
current manuscript; “It should be noted that in the proposed model the convective
resitances have been applied through the feto-placental vasculature trees, while the
diffusive flux resitances have been considered in the fetal capillaries.” Please see lines
120-123 in page 3.
4. In point 4, the authors state that they “have clearly mentioned in the manuscript
that it is assumed there are two totally separate networks, one for the calculation of
diffusive resistance and one for the calculation of convective resistance.” I cannot
find this stated explicitly in the text. I think it should be mentioned at the beginning
of section 2.1 to avoid confusion.
The author thanks the reviewer for the comment. The following statement has been
included in the current manuscript; “It should be noted that in the proposed model the
convective resitances have been applied through the feto-placental vasculature trees,
while the diffusive flux resitances have been considered in the fetal capillaries.” Please
see lines 120-123 in page 3.

5. In point 6, the authors have not satisfactorily answered my question about their
assumption that the diameter of a fetal capillary is equal to its length. Perhaps a
better way of describing this part of the model is that they are using a lumped model
to describe a network of fetal capillaries with a single effective length and diameter,
since I don’t think it’s realistic that the diameter of a fetal capillary is equal to its
length, or indeed that there is only a single capillary at the end of each branch in the
network through which diffusion takes place. Either way, there should be some
physiological justification given in the paper for the choice of the capillary diameter.
We agree with the reviewer that the diameter and the length of the fetal capillaries may
not be the same and the relation between them is more complicated. The author also
agrees that there should be some physiological justification regarding this assumption.
However, as it is mentioned in detail in Section “4.3. Model limitations”, the reason to
assume that the diameter and the length of a fetal capillaries are the same is to simplify
the problem and make that easier to solve analytically. In addition, the author agrees with
the statement that was mentioned by the reviewer where “using a lumped model to
describe a network of fetal capillaries with a single effective length and diameter” we
assume that the length and the diameter of the fetal capillary are the same. This statement
has been added to the current manuscript. Please see lines 236-239 in pages 6.
6. In the quote given in point 7, I asked whether 88 µm was too large for the
diameter of a fetal capillary. In the updated manuscript this value has changed to 2
cm. Is this a typographical error? It cannot be physiological because, as stated by
the authors on line 281 of the paper, the typical diameter of a feto-placental
capillary is of the order of magnitude of µm, not cm. The authors have also not
replied to my point about the discrepancy between the vessel diameter predicted by
Murray’s Law at the Nth bifurcation, and the capillary diameter used in the model.
We apologize for unclear statement in the previous manuscript and we would like to
thank the reviewer for the explanation. In the current manuscript, the author has revised
the calculations and the corresponding results by adding more details such as the number
of cotyledons and the number of fetal capillaries in the modeling. The value of
bifurcation level and the corresponding value for the optimal diameter and length of both
human placenta and mouse have also been revised. As mentioned by the reviewer these
values are the optimal results, that doesn’t necessarily mean it is the actual physiological
value. We have also estimated the ‘optimal’ fetal capillary diameter with respect to the
oxygen transport, by applying the values reported in Table 1 and eq. (6) in the
manuscript. We found dft=300 microns in the current manuscript where the diameter of
the fetal capillary of the vasculature system has been measured and reported as ranging
from 30 to 80 microns. The discrepancy between the analytical and experimental data
including the fetal diameter and the bifurcation level in the current manuscript has been
expressed in detail in Section “4.3 model limitations”. In this section, I have also
expressed the advantages of the current model and the plan for future work. Please see
page 9 for more details.
One of the reasons for the discrepancy between the vessel diameter predicted by
9
Murray’s Law at the Nth bifurcation, and the capillary diameter used in the model could
be because the diameter predicted by Murray’s Law at the Nth bifurcation has been
achieved due to the minimum flow resistance at the bifurcation for a fixed total volume.
However, in the proposed model we have used the combination of both convective and
diffusive resistances to minimize the resistances and to describe the capillary diameter.

Comments to the Author(s)
Major Corrections
The author reuses a significant portion of the methodology from the paper of Reis et
al. 2004 Med Phys. I strongly recommend to state upfront at the beginning (before
“As assumed...” on line 118) something along the lines of: “Below we follow the
approach of Reis et al. 2004; Bejan & Lorente 2006”.
We thank the reviewer for the comments. As mentioned before, this manuscript has a lot
of differences compared to Reis et al. 2004 because there are a lot of differences between
the lung and the placenta as well as how they function. We have used the same approach
of Reis et al. 2004 as a combination of convective and diffusive resistances to define the
structure of the placenta; however, since in the placenta we have the exchange of the
oxygen between the fetal and maternal blood, we have contributed extensively different
methods to define the exact value of oxygen concentration in the fetal blood. As
requested by the reviewer, we have added a paragraph at the beginning of Section 2.1 to
specify the approach and the differences between the current model and the model
proposed by Reis et al. 2004 as follows.
“It should be noted that in the proposed model the convective resitances have been
applied through the feto-placental vasculature trees, while the diffusive flux resitances
have been considered in the fetal capillaries. A similar approach has been used by Reis et
al. 2004 and Bejan & Lorente 2008 to define the charateristics of the alveolar sacs in the
lungs. However there are some distinctions between our proposed model and their model
including: 1) The method to define the diffusive flux resistance in the vasculature system,
2) We have calculated, in detail, using the Hill’s equation and experimental parameters
the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the fetal blood plasma and bound to
hemoglobin, 3) the number of cotyledons and the number of fetal capillaries in both
human and mouse placenta 4) some differences in the structure of the alveolar sac and
fetal capillaries, e.g., the alveolar sacs have been considered as speherical while the fetal
capillaries assumed to be cylindrical. Wherever possible, we have also analyzed and
compared our theoretical results with the experimental data.”
In Results (lines 255-259) I do not see the actual formula used for calculating
optimal N. It would benefit the reader if you provide local sensitivity analysis for the
optimal N and d with respect to key model parameters.
To determine the optimal fetal blood flow through the fetal vasculature trees (or the
optimal value of bifurcation level N), eq. (9) was mathematically minimized. We have
also used eq. (6) to define the diameter of the fetal capillary, dft. MATLAB program and
Excel have been used to define these values. The analysis of the local sensitivity for the
proposed model will be left for future collaboration with experts in this field.
Also, on line 267, Rox is given in Pa*s/m^3, while log(Rox) appears dimensionless.
11
Please remove this inconsistency by either introducing an appropriate reference
value (Rox / Rox_ref) before taking the log, or by plotting the dimensional y-axis in
Fig. 3 on a logarithmic scale.
I apologize for this error. I have fixed this error in Fig. 3 in the current manuscript by
plotting the Rox in Pa*s/m^3 versus the number of bifurcation level N.
Finally, there is strong feeling of overstating the degree of physiological applicability
of model’s predictions (in view of enormous number of strong assumptions and
simplifications made). The proposed model is by construction qualitative and not
quantitative, and it should be clearly positioned as such. I suggest to create a special
subsection 4.3 Model Limitations, which will include lines 322-337, but also needs to
be expanded (see specific comments below). In particular, I would avoid using the
term “conservative mathematical model” (see line 363), since a large number of
oversimplifications does not warrant a robust result (or lower / upper limit of any
sort).
I thank the reviewer for this suggestion. I have added a section “4.3 Model Limitations”
in the current manuscript, which emphasizes the model’s limitations, its advantages in
detail, and the future plans.
I agree with the reviewer. Therefore, the term “conservative mathematical model” has
been deleted in the current manuscript.
After addressing these points, the manuscript could be recommended for
publication.
Minor points:
Page 4, lines 164-6: add value a= 80 for human and 1 for mouse in Table 1.
We have added this value in Table 1. Please see Table 1 in page 10 &11.
Page 6, line 246: By assuming the oxygenation value for umbilical vein is identical to
feto-placental capillary you neglect the whole villous venous tree and placental
metabolism that could have a profound effect on oxygen transfer. Please make it
clear in Model Limitations section (see above).
Corrected as per the reviewer’s suggestion. We have added this assumption in the section
“4.3 Model Limitations” in the current manuscript.
Lines 285-6: why do you use mouse placenta to explain the discrepancy in the
predictions for the human placenta (namely, a predicted ‘optimal’ villous capillary
diameter of 2 cm, which is off by two orders of magnitude)?
We agree with the reviewer’s comments. After recalculating the new value of the optimal
villous capillary diameter to compare the predicted value with the ranges of the measured
data, we further analyzed the variation of the diameter of the fetal capillary versus
bifurcation level N, calculated based on the analytical model, for both human and mouse
placenta and compared them with the experimental measurements as shown in Figure
12
4A,B. As can be seen in Figure 4A, the measured dft varies from 30 to 80 microns
(Benirschke and Kaufmann 1990; Mayhew et al. 2004; Mayhew 2009; Castellucci et al.
1990) where the predicted value of dft for bifurcation level 18 is calculated as 300
microns. Figure 4B also shows that the measured average diameter of the fetal capillary
is 15 microns (Adamson et al. 2002; Coan et al. 2004) where the value of dft for 22
bifurcation level is calculated as 28 microns. We can conclude that the predicted diameter
of the fetal capillary is close to the measured values; thus our model’s estimate appears
reasonable. The discrepancy between the data could be due to the variation of
experimental measurements as well as the assumptions made in the modeling analysis as
Described in detail in Section 4.3 Model Limitations.
Page 8, line 362: change “ideal” to “idealized”
Corrected as per the reviewer’s suggestion.
Line 263: replace “conservative” with “qualitative, rather than quantitative,”
This word have been deleted and reworded as suggested by the reviewer. Please see
section “4.3 Model Limitations” in page 9 in the current manuscript.
Page 11, line 502: add “Clark A” after “Tawhai MH” to the list of co-authors.
Thanks for the comment. But, according to our records “Clark A” is the first author.
Fig. 4: While Figs 1 and 3 describe human (A) and mouse (B) placentas, both panels
in Fig. 4 are for the mouse. An electron micrograph for the human placenta would
be useful here. Did you seek permissions to reproduce the micrographs? Then state
“adapted with permission from...”
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The current manuscript has been revised and the
related figure hase been deleted. Instead, we have compared both predicted human and
mouse fetal capillary diameter with the ranges of the experimental measurements as
shown in Fig. 4 A,B.
Yes, in the previous manuscript the authors obtained permisions to reproduce the
micrographs. The permission was inadvertently omitted.
Appendix: change D to d for diameter.
Corrected as per the reviewer’s suggestion.
The Martin Jnr reference added to the manuscript is the wrong one, but the
reviewer wrongly provided the wrong year of publication; the full reference is

Appendix E
Dear Editor of the Royal Society-Open Science,
The author would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful comments. I have
modified the manuscript in line with the reviewers’ comments and have addressed their
comments in detail below. The changes are marked in green in the current manuscript.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
I think the changes made by the author have improved the manuscript. I have some
final comments about the changes made.
The author thanks the reviewer for the insightful comments. I have revised the
manuscript in line with the reviewer’s comments and have addressed in some detail
below his/her comments. The changes are highlighted in green in the manuscript.
1) In response to the previous review, the authors have added text (lines 121-123)
explaining that the convective resistance is only considered in the vascular network
and the diffusive resistance only in the capillaries. I think this is a major assumption
that still does not receive enough attention in the manuscript. It should be made
explicitly clear in these lines that all convective resistances in the capillaries are
ignored. Both of these assumptions should also be highlighted in Section 4.3 (Model
Limitations).
The author agrees with the reviewer’s comment. The statement that all convective
resistances in the capillaries are neglected has been added in the current manuscript.
Please see lines 122-123. This statement has also been added in Section 4.3 (Model
Limitations). Please see line 412.
2) I think there is not enough attention given in the conclusion to the limitations of
the work. The authors still have not made it clear in the conclusions that, although
in the work an optimal number of bifurcations is found, there are many reasons
why this result may not be appropriate in an actual placenta (e.g. the major
assumptions of the model, the fact that the placenta is not necessarily optimal for
oxygen transfer etc...).
The author concede with the reviewer that the limitations of the proposed model need to
be emphasized. A paragraph which emphasizes the focus of this research and the major
limitations of the proposed model to be appropriate for an actual placenta has been added
to the current manuscript. Please see lines 454-461. The paragraph is stated as follows.
1
“In particular, the focus of this research was to create an ideal architecture of both human
and mouse placental structures, from umbilical artery to terminal villi, by applying a
mathematical model of oxygen transport in the placenta. To obtain a reliable model that
can be appropriate for the actual placenta, the geometry and the oxygen transport problem
should adhere as closely as possible to the in vivo state. Although several assumptions
were made when creating the model including the 2D structure of the placenta, the
consideration for only oxygen transport in the placenta, the symmetrical structure of the
vasculature system, to name a few. This study presents the first attempt to represent the
complex structure of the feto-placental vasculature system from the large to small vessels
that contribute to the mass exchange between the mother and her fetus.”
If these comments are dealt with I think the paper is suitable for publication.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
With the revised version of the paper, further results and analysis have been added.
Unfortunately, in some places this leads to additional somewhat contradictory
comparisons to literature data, which in places weakens the message of the paper.
The model itself, while structurally simplified does potentially add relevant new
information on placental exchange as it aims to bridge the gap between umbilical
cord and placental capillaries. However, an analysis, as suggested by myself and
other reviewers, of the impacts of model parameters is needed to overcome the
apparent mismatch in model predictions and experimental data. As it stands the
article appears to attempt to explain away discrepancies, which could be explained
more rationally by expected variation in parameter values.
I believe that rather than focusing on a single set of parameters, and proposing
analysis of these parameters belongs in future studies, \the paper would greatly
benefit by providing a list of all model parameters (of which there are not a large
number) and assessing the impact of each on predictions. It concerns me that with
each revision of this manuscript the ‘optimal’ tree structure appears to have been
adjusted, which suggests that the model may be sensitive to its parameterization.
This is not necessarily a negative to the model, but needs to be presented
pragmatically to allow (e.g.) a clear suggestion of what could be improved in
experimental studies and/or what variation in fetoplacental structure might impact
function the most. Some specific comments follow:
The author thanks the reviewer for his/her insightful comments. The author also agrees
that an analysis of the results and the impacts of model parameters might be needed to
overcome the apparent mismatch in model predictions and experimental data. The
changes are highlighted in green in the current manuscript.
As mentioned before, the focus of this research was to create an ideal architecture of both
human and mouse placental structures, from umbilical artery to terminal villi, by
2
applying a mathematical model of oxygen transport in the placenta. To obtain a reliable
model that can be appropriate for the actual placenta, the geometry and the oxygen
transport problem should adhere as closely as possible to the in vivo state. Although
several assumptions were made when creating the model including the 2D structure, the
consideration for only oxygen transport in the placenta, the symmetrical structure of the
vasculature system, to name a few. This study presents the first attempt to represent the
complex structure of the feto-placental vasculature system from the large to small vessels
that contribute to the mass exchange between the mother and her fetus. Therefore, in the
revised manuscript and the proposed model to decrease the discrepancy between the
analytical data and the experimental measurements and to get a reliable model, I tried to
add some specific parameters and/or vary some other parameters as closely as possible to
the in vivo state which results the “optimal” tree structure to be adjusted in each revision
of the manuscript. However, as suggested by the reviewer, I have added a paragraph in
the current manuscript (please see page 9 lines 384-394), which explains more rationally
the impact of the variation in parameter values to the porposed model and assesses the
effect of each parameters on the predicted results. Some are listed as follows.
Some parameters are critical in order to decrease the discrepancy between the
experimental data and predicted results at each step to define eq.(9), including; 1) the
diameter and the length of the fetal capillaries (i.e., dft and hft) which play a critical role
because they are both involved in the surface area where the gas exchange occurs., 2) the
thickness of the placental barrier d, separating fetal and maternal blood, 3) the length and
diameter of the umblical artery (i.e, L0 and d0), 4) Cox umbilical artery and Cox ft capillary that are the
concentrations of oxygen in fetal blood and they are a function of the partial pressure of
oxygen, 5) the partial pressure of umbilical artery and umbilical vein <U+0394>P, 6) the number
of cotyledons <U+F061>, and 7) the number of fetal capillaries <U+F062>. It should be emphasized that all
these parameters depend specifically on the experimental measurements. In the current
manuscript, they have been taken from the literatures. However, varying these data
impact the predicted total resistance and the number of bifurcation level N in the
vasculature system. Therefore, careful measurements of these data might decrease the
discrepancy between the analytical predictions and experimental data.
1. Page 6 lines 237-9 is beta the number of capillaries or villous trees? It looks to me
that it would more properly be the number of fetal capillaries per terminal villous as
the number of 2^N is the total number of conductive vessels arising from the
umbilical cord by my understanding of the model, not per villous tree as I
understand from the previous description of the model. If this is the case is 60 really
an appropriate number?
The author thanks the reviewer for this comment. The proposed model assumes that <U+F062> is
the number of villous trees in each cotyledon and each villous tree has one fetal
capillaries. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this value has been reported to vary
between 60 and 70 for the human palcenta (Benirschke & Kaufmann 1990). This
statement has also been revised in the current manuscript. Please see page 6 lines 239-
242.

2. In the human model the ‘optimal’ flow rate in the capillary is defined as 25.13
ml/min. Is this the total volume flow rate of oxygen? This certainly doesn’t make a
great deal of sense as a volume flow rate of blood as one would expect volumetric
flow through the umbilical cord to be ~250ml/min up to 500 ml/min by the Gordon
citation you give, which we could split into 2^18 capillaries and each capillary would
receive a lot less than 25ml/min of blood. How then could the flow rate of oxygen (or
blood) be so high?
The author thanks the reviewer for the comment and apologizes for the confusion. Using
the proposed model, the human placenta optimum “oxygen” flow rate in the capillary has
been defined as 25.13 ml/min. As can be seen in line 323, in the formula to find this
volume flow rate <U+0394>P (i.e., the partial pressure between the umbilical artery and umbilical
vein) plays a critical role which herein has been assumed following the work by Gill et al.
2011. As mentioned by the reviewer, we can not compare this value with the volume
flow rate of “blood” through the vasculature system as of 500 ml/min (It should be
emphasized that the value of 500 ml/min has been also assumed by Gordon et al. 2007 to
define the blood flow through the vasculature system). Also, because we could not find
any value for oxygen volume flow rate in the literatures, we could not compare that with
the experimental measurements. Therefore, the experimental measurements of <U+0394>P could
impact the value of oxygen volume flow rate. I have added <U+0394>P, as one of the parameters
that impact the variation of the predicted outputs (please see page 9 lines 384-394).
Accordingly, I have also added the “oxygen” volume flow rate in the current manuscript
for both human and mouse placenta to spcifically mention this value represents the
oxygen volume flowrate. Please see lines 111, 322, 353, 423, and 446.
3. The discrepancy in fetal capillary diameter seems to arise from use of Murray’s
law to describe the size of the vessels with generation, presumably if the rate of
change of vessel diameter was greater, then a reasonable capillary diameter would
be achieved with fewer bifurcations. While I can accept that Murrays law makes it
straightforward to solve a model analytically, I suspect there may be evidence to
suggest another simple ‘generation vs size’ law could also be used (simply another
constant number instead of 2^(1/3) as a diameter This would change other
predictions of ‘optimality’, but presumably would increase resistance of the system
and potentially worsen other predictions. Again an analysis of the sensitivity of
model to parameters would elucidate this.
The author thanks the reviewer for this comment and agrees that the discrepancy in fetal
capillary diameter might be due to Murray’s law. However, to calculate the fetal capillary
diameter analytically we have used eq. (6) where the Murray’s law was not yet
implemented in the equation. In this equation, we assumed the length and the diameter of
the fetal capillaries are the same which could lead to the discrepancy beween the
experimental data and predicted value. We have used Murray’s law in order to define the
value of N in eqs. (7)-(9). The sensitivity of the model results to the parameters have been
explained in detail in page 9 lines 384-394.
Clark et al 2010 is still cited incorrectly (e.g. page 4 line 163), I don't think it is
4
relevant at all to the paper.
I apologize for this error. This error has been fixed in the current manuscript. Please see
page 4 line 163.

Appendix F
Dear Editor of the Royal Society-Open Science,
The author would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful comments. I have
modified the manuscript in line with the reviewers’ comments and have addressed their
comments in detail below. The changes are marked in yellow in the current manuscript.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed most of my comments. My remaining comment I feel
may be a terminology issue.
See below for a response to a previous comment:
"The author thanks the reviewer for this comment. The proposed model assumes
that ß is the number of villous trees in each cotyledon and each villous tree has one
fetal capillaries. To the best of the author's knowledge, this value has been reported
to vary between 60 and 70 for the human palcenta (Benirschke & Kaufmann 1990).
This statement has also been revised in the current manuscript. Please see page 6
lines 239-242."
I don't see any evidence that there are 60-70 villous trees per cotyledon in the
Benirschke & Kaufmann book. I quote from the book: "From the chorionic plate at
term, 60-70 villous stems arise, each branching into one villous Tree". So, there are
60-70 villous trees per placenta, not per cotyledon. In fact, this is the context in
which villous tree is referred to in the rest of the paper. To be consistent with the
rest of your terminology I believe that you mean to say each terminal villous has one
capillary (i.e. the terminal branch of a villous tree)?
I would like to thank this reviewer for this comment and his/her perfect explanation
which compeletly improved the knowledge of the author. I agree with the reviewer in the
fact that I mean each terminal villous has one capillary. Therefore, the proposed model
assumes that <U+F062> is the number of terminal villous and each terminal villous has one
capillary. I have added the following statement in page 6 lines 239-243 as “By
considering the fact that oxygen diffuses at 2N fetal capillaries and <U+F062> is the number of
terminal villous and each terminal villous has one capillary (i.e. the terminal branch of a
villous tree), the overall mass of oxygen diffusing to the fetal capillary can be obtained

This assumption has also be added to the list of assumptions in the section “4.3. Model
Limitations” as follows. “, and (14) we assumed the number of terminal villous <U+F062> to vary
