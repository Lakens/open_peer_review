Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The Authors conducted here an investigation mainly focused on addressing the diet overlap and
potential for intraguild predation among a marsupial micro-carnivore and two species of
predatory spiders. Overall, the manuscript is well written, with a focused introduction, a
thorough sample scheme, detailed methodology section, novel results and broad discussions.
My major concern is that the predators’ sample size is very small, with a total of 10 marsupials,
all belonging to S. youngsoni, and 27 predatory spiders investigated. Although this limitation is
mentioned within the text (Pag. 15, Line 5), the Authors should extensively remark that in the
discussion. For this reason, strong ecological conclusions on IGP and prey selectivity cannot be
drawn.
More specific comments:
Although the title is sounding, I would suggest to change "micro-carnivores" with “micro-
carnivore marsupials and arthropods”
Pag. 11, Line 51: Since IGP was the main scope of the research. I would add here also information
about the entity of spider predation by miturgids
Pag. 12, Lines 55-57: the word “mostly” requires statistical analysis which has not been provided.
Since there is only 1 index per predator type, an alternative would be to calculate Shannon
indexes followed by Hutcheson t-test (Hutcheson 1970, J. Theor. Biol. 29 p 151)
Pag. 14, Line 30-32: This sentence should be reworded because, if I understand correctly your
analysis, you did not perform a formal comparison between S. youngsoni-lycosids, S. youngsoni-
miturgids and lycosids-miturgids diet overlap
Pag. 15, Line 18: for the same reason, the word “greatest” is used here in an unclear way, because
the statistical analysis does not support it. In fact, comparisons were not performed between
different levels of diet overlap, therefore the overlap is only “greatest” than by chance. I would
suggest rewording
Pag. 15, Line 52-53: I agree with the possible explanation, are there any references to add?
It would be great to add in the discussion section prospective for the development of molecular
analysis of predation (gut content for spiders and perhaps feaces for S. youngsoni), since DNA-
based (PCR, NGS, etc.) techniques are becoming very popular in this field of research.
Pag. 18, Lines 32-33: I definitely agree with this sentence

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors are dealing with an interesting topic: the potential for intraguild predation (IGP)
between two species from different phyla, an insectivorous marsupial and a wolf spider. They
hypothesized that the temporal activity levels and microhabitat use of the two species are similar
resulting in IGP with the marsupial as intraguild predator (IG) and wolf spiders as IG prey. The
manuscript is well written, and the conducted experiments are suitable to verify the author’s
hypothesis. I have just some minor comments.

Page 8, section 3.4: Miturgids were excluded from the evaluation of the temporal overlap of
activity. The captured Miturgidae and Lycosidae did not greatly differ in their body masses
(0.51g versus 0.49g) and the habitus is also similar. Which features were used to discriminate
between them?

Response to reviewers for RSOS-171872: Assessing the potential for intraguild
predation among taxonomically disparate micro-carnivores: marsupials and arthropods
Dear Editor,
Thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript. We found the reviewers’ comments
very helpful for improving this paper. We have completed all the suggested revisions and
addressed all questions. Please find below the reviewer’s comments and our response directly
after each point.
Reviewer 1
General Comments
Reviewer 1: The Authors conducted here an investigation mainly focused on addressing the
diet overlap and potential for intraguild predation among a marsupial micro-carnivore and
two species of predatory spiders. Overall, the manuscript is well written, with a focused
introduction, a thorough sample scheme, detailed methodology section, novel results and
broad discussions.
My major concern is that the predators’ sample size is very small, with a total of 10
marsupials, all belonging to S. youngsoni, and 27 predatory spiders investigated. Although
this limitation is mentioned within the text (Pag. 15, Line 5), the Authors should extensively
remark that in the discussion. For this reason, strong ecological conclusions on IGP and prey
selectivity cannot be drawn.
Authors: Thank you for your positive feedback on our paper. We have addressed
your helpful comments to improve the quality of this study. In particular, we comment in the
second paragraph of section 5.1 that the dietary sample size was small, and reiterate this point
again in section 6 (Conclusion).
Specific comments:
Title
Reviewer 1: Although the title is sounding, I would suggest to change "micro-carnivores"
with “micro-carnivore marsupials and arthropods”
Authors: Thank you for this fitting suggestion, we have adjusted the title accordingly
to: "Assessing the potential for intraguild predation among taxonomically disparate
micro-carnivores: marsupials and arthropods".
Methods
Reviewer 1 Pag. 11, Line 51: Since IGP was the main scope of the research. I would add
here also information about the entity of spider predation by miturgids
Authors: Thank you for this suggestion. We have included this information so lines
51-53 now read: “Lycosids constituted 13% of all captures by S. youngsoni, while no
miturgids were observed being consumed by this species. Moths were selected most
often by miturgids (38%), while the only spiders consumed by miturgids were
jumping spiders (7% of captures).”
Reviewer 1 Pag. 12, Lines 55-57: the word “mostly” requires statistical analysis which has
not been provided. Since there is only 1 index per predator type, an alternative would be to
calculate Shannon indexes followed by Hutcheson t-test (Hutcheson 1970, J. Theor. Biol. 29
p 151).
Authors: We assume that the reviewer is referring to page 11, rather than page 12, for
this comment, as this where we refer to our dietary diversity index. Although we appreciate
the reviewer's suggestion here, after some consideration, we have decided not to follow it.
There are two reasons for this. First, diversity indexes (Simpson's, Shannon's etc) are based
on the assumption that populations of values are available rather than simply samples from
them, so that any difference between two values can be taken to represent the 'true' difference
between the populations. In other words, statistical testing is superfluous because
populations, not samples from them, are being compared. An assumption that two
populations differ may be harder to sustain if the indexes they return are very similar; in our
case, however, we believe that the large differences between the values of 0.42, 0.28 and 0.18
can be justifiably taken to reflect differences that are real. Second, for the comparisons of
most interest - that is, magnitudes of dietary overlap - we have provided robust statistical
evidence for whether values are higher or lower than expected using simulation modeling.
Discussion
Reviewer 1 Pag. 14, Line 30-32: This sentence should be reworded because, if I understand
correctly your analysis, you did not perform a formal comparison between S. youngsoni-
lycosids, S. youngsoni-miturgids and lycosids-miturgids diet overlap
Authors: Thank you for pointing this out. We have re-worded the sentence to read:
“There was more overlap in diet between S. youngsoni and lycosids, while weaker
overlap in diet was observed between S. youngsoni and miturgids, thus supporting our
first hypothesis that S. youngsoni would exhibit greater overlap in diet with lycosids
than with other common invertebrate predators.”
Reviewer 1 Pag. 15, Line 18: for the same reason, the word “greatest” is used here in an
unclear way, because the statistical analysis does not support it. In fact, comparisons were not
performed between different levels of diet overlap, therefore the overlap is only “greatest”
than by chance. I would suggest rewording
Authors: Thank you for your suggestion. We have re-worded the sentence to read:
“In this study, there was more overlap in prey types consumed between the two
predator-groups with the lowest dietary diversity, S. youngsoni and lycosids” to
reduce the ambiguity.
Reviewer 1 Pag. 15, Line 52-53: I agree with the possible explanation, are there any
references to add?
It would be great to add in the discussion section prospective for the development of
molecular analysis of predation (gut content for spiders and perhaps feaces for S. youngsoni),
since DNA-based (PCR, NGS, etc.) techniques are becoming very popular in this field of
research.
Authors: There are no formal references to add for this point. However, the fact that
lycosids may be able to avoid pitfall traps due to their eyesight was mentioned in a
discussion with Dr Robert Raven from the Queensland Museum, and hence we have
added a personal comments reference to the end of this line. We have also included a
paragraph at the end of section 5.4 ‘Future Directions’ discussing the potential use of
molecular techniques, in particular PCR-based gut content analysis, for this study.
Reviewer 1 Pag. 18, Lines 32-33: I definitely agree with this sentence
Authors: Thank you.
Reviewer 2
General Comments
Reviewer 2: The authors are dealing with an interesting topic: the potential for intraguild
predation (IGP) between two species from different phyla, an insectivorous marsupial and a
wolf spider. They hypothesized that the temporal activity levels and microhabitat use of the
two species are similar resulting in IGP with the marsupial as intraguild predator (IG) and
wolf spiders as IG prey. The manuscript is well written, and the conducted experiments are
suitable to verify the author’s hypothesis. I have just some minor comments.
Authors: Thank you for your positive response. We will take your useful comments
into consideration.
Specific comments:
Methods
Reviewer 2Page 5: How were the observers able to identify the captured prey from a
distance of 2-3m?
Authors: It was a tough balance to keep enough distance from the spider so as to minimize
the disruption to their natural feeding behavior, whilst also staying close enough to observe
them foraging. The addition of the reflective tape enhanced our ability to detect the spiders
and allowed us to notice clear changes in their movements from further away. For instance,
often a spider would move rapidly and ‘pounce’ before becoming stationary. This was a clear
indication that the spider had caught its prey and we would carefully shift closer (~1.5 m) to
identify what had been caught. We have added the following sentence to clarify this point: "If
we observed prey being captured, we would carefully approach to within ~1.5 m to confirm
its identity."
Reviewer 2 Page 8, section 3.4: Miturgids were excluded from the evaluation of the
temporal overlap of activity. The captured Miturgidae and Lycosidae did not greatly differ in
their body masses (0.51g versus 0.49g) and the habitus is also similar. Which features were
used to discriminate between them?
Authors: Excellent question. The key difference between the two spiders is the
arrangement of the eyes. Lycosids have four large posterior eyes which form a square
on the carapace, while the anterior eyes are small and form a single row (Figs 1 & 2).
In comparison, miturgids have eight small eyes arranged into two rows of four. This
is mentioned on page 15, lines 52-53.

Reviewer 2 Page 9, first line: What are EXIF data?
Authors: Thank you for your question. We have added a sentence explaining what
EXIF data is to our readers. The sentence reads: “EXIF data refers to the information
stored within an image and can include GPS location, camera make and model, time
and date, exposure, shutter speed and resolution.”
