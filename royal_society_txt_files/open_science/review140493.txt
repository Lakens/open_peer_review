Title: How does this study address both local and global scales? I am not sure that this title is
reflective of the work conducted herein, as samples from only two sites were examined. I suggest
deleting “When local meets global”
This present study addresses the differential responses to thermal stress among octocorals
collected from two different depths along the same wall in the Mediterranean Sea. Their study is
one of the first to compare necrosis responses within azooxanthellate octocorals from different
depths while examining the population genetics of both sub-populations using 9 microsatellite
loci. The main finding includes differential responses from two depths although the populations
appeared to be panmictic. This manuscript suffers from brevity and vagueness, particularly in the
methods. It was unclear how necrosis was measured and whether the fragments were all the
same size, and no statistics were computed to determine whether the survivorship curves were
significantly different between the two depths. Furthermore, they only conducted the experiment
at one time point, so these results could be the result of a tank effect. There was no information as
to whether they measured other variables (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, pCO2) and whether these
variables were consistent in both tanks throughout the experiment. More details are needed in
this manuscript before publication in this journal. Please see specific comments and questions
below.
Introduction
The introduction has all of the right components, but could use attention to organization. As it
stands, the intro contains two large paragraphs; the second paragraph mixes several ideas.
Watch the use of “envision” throughout the ms. “investigate” or “examine” may be a better word
choice in several cases
Line 68: what are “variability of scales” and “diversity of responses”?
Line 104: What type of climate change?
Material and Methods
Line 111-118: What are the ranges of summer and winter temperatures? What was the
temperature when individuals were collected? Be more specific.
Line 125: What were the size of the aquaria? Did all fragments consist of the same size or number
of polyps?
Line 126: Why 16 deg?
Line 128: Suggest including these data as supplemental material, as they are important to your
choice of temperature regime.
Line 131: How did you determine necrosis? Loss of polyps? Blackened tissue? Did you measure a
percentage of the colony affected?
Line 139: Were the necrosis statistics created by you? Or is there a citation?
3
Lines 168-169. Sentence structure is awkward. What is “which a probability of sexual
reproduction p sex.”?
Lines 178-179. Add use of AMOVA for testing whether Fst differs between the two depths
Results
Line 184: Experimental time belongs in methods
Line 186: “its basis” Do you mean the baseline dataset? Or the base of the fragment?
Line 187: change “evolve” to “change”
Line 189: “very different” is vague. Add a statistical test to determine the level of significance.
Perhaps an ANCOVA?
Lines 192-193. This is interesting. Are these replicates very different genotypes? Or do you mean
replicates of the same coral colony that were used in the experiment? Perhaps a sibling or kinship
analysis would provide insight.
Line 194: Unclear why Weibull distribution was used. More justification would clarify this.
Lines 212-223: Were their certain lineages or alleles that were present in individuals that showed
responses versus those that did not show response? This could make an interesting comparison.
Discussion
Discussion is quite good. Minor changes necessary, but I do suggest the authors take another look
at editing sentence structure and word choice.
Line 232: “quite far” is awkward
Line 233: How do you know this?
Line 237: In what species was mortality observed? And if mortality was observed at 22 deg, why
not use this threshold?
Lines 259-263. If different stress protocols were used, how can you be sure that the response
differences are not due to methods? Suggest re-wording or removing.
Figures
I suggest removing Figure 1 to supplemental material.

Dabat-Pivotto and co-authors studied the vertical variability of response to thermal stress as well
as vertical genetic differentiation in an octocoral. The approach is really interesting and
innovative, as it combines the study of thermotolerance and population genetics. The questions
addressed are of major importance, in the present context of global warming. The study is well
executed and the analysis are sound. However, there is a major problem in presenting the results
and analysis, which is most likely linked with the fact English is not the natal language of the
authors. There is a clear need for the authors to have the text edited by someone who is fluent in
English. In its present form, the text is unclear, and I just could not understand some sentences. I
am fully aware of the difficulty for non-English speakers to write in English, and I can certainly
relate to this issue. However, the problem is too important here to be ignored.
In some sections, the authors tend to oversell their results a little. For example, they talk about
“Evolution of thermotolerance” when no phylogenetic data is provided.
The methods section needs to integrate a paragraph describing the model in terms of life history,
distribution, etc. Clarification is also needed about aquarium system used.
In the results section, authors need to present data from the “control” treatment for adequate
comparison.
The discussion section is the one that needs English editing the most. It is really hard to
understand.
The reference section also needs more effort. In some references, the first letter of each word of
the title is capitalised and in others this is not the case. Some references have doi, others don't.
Some references don’t even have a title. The books are not correctly cited, and some citations are
clearly incomplete (2, 25, 42, 47, for example).
I also made a number of comments/suggestions in the attached pdf file. I hope this helps.
As a conclusion, I would recommend rejecting the article in its present form, and would advise
the authors to resubmit a significantly amended version of their work.

Pivotto et al. Resubmission Review
Highly contrasted responses of Mediterranean octocorals to climate change along a depth
gradient.
I really enjoyed this study and was looking forward to reading a revised version. The authors
have addressed most of my comments. However, their additions have raised a few more
questions and issues that need attention. I am most concerned with the fact that there could be a
tank effect, which could lead to the different responses observed between replicates of the same
coral colony. However, I think this can be addressed by more details in the text and more data. I
am curious if the replicates 1 and 2 from each of 20 m and 40 m correspond to certain tanks? If so,
I do not think you have ruled out a tank effect. I think it is important to compare the necrosis
response curves between the tanks for specimens from each depth. It is very curious to me that
hazard functions for replicates-2 are lower than replicates-1 from both depths. I would not expect
to see this in the absence of a tank effect.
I am also concerned with the interpretation of the AMOVA results. However, the paragraph
detailing the population genetics was poorly written, so it left me somewhat confused. I am most
concerned that you found significant (p=0.036) FST and FSC (p=0.043) (Table S3) between
samples collected at 20 m with those collected at 40 m. If so, this suggests genetic differentiation
between the two depths (alebit weakly differentiated). I think you need to re-examine these
results and also include STRUCTURE analyses to corroborate your findings.
I think the study is novel enough for publication in this journal and will be of interest to a wide
audience. Overall, this is an interesting study, and I recommend it for publication after
addressing these further issues. See below for additional comments:

Abstract
Abstract needs some editing and clarification. Here are suggested changes:
Lines 20-21: How can analyzing thermotolerance levels give a better understanding of the origin
of adaptive response? I suggest re-wording this sentence as you are not looking at particular up
or down regulation of genes, selective SNPs, etc.
Line 27: Instead of “contrast” perhaps “differential”
Line 28 change “for” to “of”
Lines 29-30. Be more specific re: “contrasting observed in situ temps” Too-vague
Line 31: Remove “genetic”
Line 33: Now that I know that several tanks were used, I am not convinced that the replicates
from the same colony that showed variable responses is not due to a tank effect. Just because a
flow through system was used does not mean that all water chemistry values were similar in each
tank. However, I think that you can test whether there was a tank effect by comparing response
curves for specimens in each tank.
Line 36: I do not think your results show a basis for understanding process of adaptation. That
conclusion is a bit strong. Rather, you have nicely shown that a single population that is not
genetically differentiated with depth can show variable responses to temperature. Although the
acclimatization hypothesis is possible, it is also possible that populations at these two sites have
undergone adaptive divergence in the presence of gene flow. You suggest both of these in the
intro, and I do not believe you have provided ample evidence to refute adaptive divergence. You
have only amplified a few (9) putative neutral loci. Other genes could indicate that selection is
maintaining some differences. I suggest reading the following, and cite as necessary:

Narrow Adult Hybrid Zone in a Broadcast Spawner." The American Naturalist 184.6 (2014): 702-
713.

Savolainen, Outi, Martin Lascoux, and Juha Merilä. "Ecological genomics of local adaptation."
Nature Reviews Genetics 14.11 (2013): 807-820.
Intro:
Introduction is much better than previous version.
Line 45: “This is also…” Do you mean climate change is a real-time experiment? If so, re-word
sentence to reflect your intention.
Line 100: The hypothesis states that you tested for difference in adaptive abilities. I think it makes
more sense to state for ‘stress response’ or ‘thermotolerance’.
Methods:
Line 107: Were all the samples from exactly 20 m and 40 m? Please add depth range here.
Model Species: I suggest moving the Model species paragraph to be first paragraph in the
Methods.
10
Line 123: Add that it is a brooding species.
Line 138: Is acclimation a better word choice instead of acclimatization?
Line 149: Were the temperatures measured each day? If so state that please, and include the data
in the supplemental material.
Line 211: Since you include Fct/Fsc in the results, add these into the methods and state what they
mean. I think it would help readers, as it is not always commonly seen in the literature. And,
your study is broad enough to reach many people who are not as familiar with F statistics.
I think you should also include STRUCTURE analyses (running K 1-3) as supplemental material.
I think some readers would like to see this analysis and would provide strength to the Fst results,
particularly as your AMOVA results indicate that there are significant FST values between the
depths. This could alter some of your interpretation in the discussion.
Results
Line 216: At end of sentence, include “in specimens from either depth”.
Line 219: “Seemed to appear” is vague. What day did it appear? Be more specific
Line 222-223. Again, this needs further thought as this could be due to tank effects.
Line 226: I think this fact about the Weibull shape should be in the methods.
Line 230: Change sentences to “Cumulative hazard functions indicated that the risk of necrosis
increased with time (Fig. 2). A clear difference in necrosis levels was also evident between
colonies collected from 20 m and 40m.”
Lines 236-237. I am concerned that the hazard function is lower for R2 for both 20 and 40 m. This
is curious to me, and it makes me wonder whether “replicates 1 and 2” correspond to certain
tanks.
Pop Gen Section: More details would be helpful and attention to text is needed. What was the
range in number of alleles? Were there any private alleles in samples from each depth? Were any
of the loci out of HWE?
Lines 245-246: Should list Fst first, followed by p value. Change FST to FST throughout.
Lines 246-247. What are “all other comparisons?” How does this differ from the next sentence as
you state for all other analyses except AMOVA samples were grouped by depth? This is really
confusing. Did you not test whether the FST differed between the samples collected from 20 m
with those collected from 40 m using all 9 loci? I think the wording and the organization is
making this section more confusing than it needs to be.
Discussion
I find it very interesting that there was a mass mortality event at 22 deg yet only ~5% necrosis
experimentally for individuals at 20 m. To me, it seems most plausible that this is due to
pathogens and other fouling fauna present in the natural environment. In this first paragraph,
this is mentioned. Are there any studies that can support these findings? That would provide
strength to this point in the discussion.
11
Lines 297-298. This sentence “This apparently did not induce differences in necrosis threshold
between depths under common conditions for E. singularis” is confusing. What is “this”? And
what common conditions?
Lines 298-304: Although the feeding differences may be a possibility, it seems unlikely to me that
this would cause such a difference. Is it possible that the differences could be due to different
depths of the samples?
Line 329: what is s.s. ??
Lines 333-339: I am not convinced of this argument. You state that high gene flow would limit the
action of local selection. However, adaptive divergence in the presence of gene flow could still
occur. You sampled very few loci across the genome. There could be several others that are under
selection, which could maintain some of the differences. I suggest re-thinking this argument.
Line 346: wide diversity of response? Where are the data for this?
Lines 358-361: Again, looking at necrosis levels between tanks would strengthen this finding.
Line 364: This is interesting. Was the health of all the colonies checked prior to the experiment?
Line 366-368. What does “initial position mean”? Confusing
Line 399-400. Change “short distance environmental gradients” to “small vertical distances”
Line 405: delete “that evolutionary models” and change to “to”.
Figures
From Table S3. The caption needs to explain these statistics are from tests of samples (n=?) at 20
m with samples (n=?) at 40 m. I see that you tested whether FST was significant between depths,
and in fact it was. Why wasn’t this in the results?

to see this in the absence of a tank effect.
I am also concerned with the interpretation of the AMOVA results. However, the paragraph
detailing the population genetics was poorly written, so it left me somewhat confused. I am most
concerned that you found significant (p=0.036) FST and FSC (p=0.043) (Table S3) between
14
samples collected at 20 m with those collected at 40 m. If so, this suggests genetic differentiation
between the two depths (alebit weakly differentiated). I think you need to re-examine these
results and also include STRUCTURE analyses to corroborate your findings.
I think the study is novel enough for publication in this journal and will be of interest to a wide
audience. Overall, this is an interesting study, and I recommend it for publication after
addressing these further issues. See below for additional comments:
Abstract
Abstract needs some editing and clarification. Here are suggested changes:
Lines 20-21: How can analyzing thermotolerance levels give a better understanding of the origin
of adaptive response? I suggest re-wording this sentence as you are not looking at particular up
or down regulation of genes, selective SNPs, etc.
Line 27: Instead of “contrast” perhaps “differential”
Line 28 change “for” to “of”
Lines 29-30. Be more specific re: “contrasting observed in situ temps” Too-vague
Line 31: Remove “genetic”
Line 33: Now that I know that several tanks were used, I am not convinced that the replicates
from the same colony that showed variable responses is not due to a tank effect. Just because a
flow through system was used does not mean that all water chemistry values were similar in each
tank. However, I think that you can test whether there was a tank effect by comparing response
curves for specimens in each tank.
Line 36: I do not think your results show a basis for understanding process of adaptation. That
conclusion is a bit strong. Rather, you have nicely shown that a single population that is not
genetically differentiated with depth can show variable responses to temperature. Although the
acclimatization hypothesis is possible, it is also possible that populations at these two sites have
undergone adaptive divergence in the presence of gene flow. You suggest both of these in the
intro, and I do not believe you have provided ample evidence to refute adaptive divergence. You
have only amplified a few (9) putative neutral loci. Other genes could indicate that selection is
maintaining some differences. I suggest reading the following, and cite as necessary:

Intro:
Introduction is much better than previous version.
Line 45: “This is also…” Do you mean climate change is a real-time experiment? If so, re-word
sentence to reflect your intention.
15
Line 100: The hypothesis states that you tested for difference in adaptive abilities. I think it makes
more sense to state for ‘stress response’ or ‘thermotolerance’.
Methods:
Line 107: Were all the samples from exactly 20 m and 40 m? Please add depth range here.
Model Species: I suggest moving the Model species paragraph to be first paragraph in the
Methods.
Line 123: Add that it is a brooding species.
Line 138: Is acclimation a better word choice instead of acclimatization?
Line 149: Were the temperatures measured each day? If so state that please, and include the data
in the supplemental material.
Line 211: Since you include Fct/Fsc in the results, add these into the methods and state what they
mean. I think it would help readers, as it is not always commonly seen in the literature. And,
your study is broad enough to reach many people who are not as familiar with F statistics.
I think you should also include STRUCTURE analyses (running K 1-3) as supplemental material.
I think some readers would like to see this analysis and would provide strength to the Fst results,
particularly as your AMOVA results indicate that there are significant FST values between the
depths. This could alter some of your interpretation in the discussion.
Results
Line 216: At end of sentence, include “in specimens from either depth”.
Line 219: “Seemed to appear” is vague. What day did it appear? Be more specific
Line 222-223. Again, this needs further thought as this could be due to tank effects.
Line 226: I think this fact about the Weibull shape should be in the methods.
Line 230: Change sentences to “Cumulative hazard functions indicated that the risk of necrosis
increased with time (Fig. 2). A clear difference in necrosis levels was also evident between
colonies collected from 20 m and 40m.”
Lines 236-237. I am concerned that the hazard function is lower for R2 for both 20 and 40 m. This
is curious to me, and it makes me wonder whether “replicates 1 and 2” correspond to certain
tanks.
Pop Gen Section: More details would be helpful and attention to text is needed. What was the
range in number of alleles? Were there any private alleles in samples from each depth? Were any
of the loci out of HWE?
Lines 245-246: Should list Fst first, followed by p value. Change FST to FST throughout.
Lines 246-247. What are “all other comparisons?” How does this differ from the next sentence as
you state for all other analyses except AMOVA samples were grouped by depth? This is really
confusing. Did you not test whether the FST differed between the samples collected from 20 m
with those collected from 40 m using all 9 loci? I think the wording and the organization is
making this section more confusing than it needs to be.
16
Discussion
I find it very interesting that there was a mass mortality event at 22 deg yet only ~5% necrosis
experimentally for individuals at 20 m. To me, it seems most plausible that this is due to
pathogens and other fouling fauna present in the natural environment. In this first paragraph,
this is mentioned. Are there any studies that can support these findings? That would provide
strength to this point in the discussion.
Lines 297-298. This sentence “This apparently did not induce differences in necrosis threshold
between depths under common conditions for E. singularis” is confusing. What is “this”? And
what common conditions?
Lines 298-304: Although the feeding differences may be a possibility, it seems unlikely to me that
this would cause such a difference. Is it possible that the differences could be due to different
depths of the samples?
Line 329: what is s.s. ??
Lines 333-339: I am not convinced of this argument. You state that high gene flow would limit the
action of local selection. However, adaptive divergence in the presence of gene flow could still
occur. You sampled very few loci across the genome. There could be several others that are under
selection, which could maintain some of the differences. I suggest re-thinking this argument.
Line 346: wide diversity of response? Where are the data for this?
Lines 358-361: Again, looking at necrosis levels between tanks would strengthen this finding.
Line 364: This is interesting. Was the health of all the colonies checked prior to the experiment?
Line 366-368. What does “initial position mean”? Confusing
Line 399-400. Change “short distance environmental gradients” to “small vertical distances”
Line 405: delete “that evolutionary models” and change to “to”.
Figures
From Table S3. The caption needs to explain these statistics are from tests of samples (n=?) at 20
m with samples (n=?) at 40 m. I see that you tested whether FST was significant between depths,
and in fact it was. Why wasn’t this in the results?

Comments to the Author(s)
Title: How does this study address both local and global scales? I am not sure that this title is
eflective of the work conducted herein, as samples from only two sites were examined. I
suggest deleting “When local meets global”
The title has been modified accordingly: “Highly contrasted responses of Mediterranean
octocorals to climate change along a depth gradient.”
This present study addresses the differential responses to thermal stress among octocorals
collected from two different depths along the same wall in the Mediterranean Sea. Their
study is one of the first to compare necrosis responses within azooxanthellate octocorals
rom different depths while examining the population genetics of both sub-populations using
9 microsatellite loci. The main finding includes differential responses from two depths
although the populations appeared to be panmictic. This manuscript suffers from brevity and
vagueness, particularly in the methods. It was unclear how necrosis was measured and
whether the fragments were all the same size, and no statistics were computed to determine
whether the survivorship curves were significantly different between the two depths.
Furthermore, they only conducted the experiment at one time point, so these results could
be the result of a tank effect. There was no information as to whether they measured other
variables (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, pCO2) and whether these variables were consistent in
publication in this journal. Please see specific comments and questions below.
We corrected the material and methods part by adding more precise information on these
points. We now indicate the size of the fragments, and we better explain the experimental
protocol. We did not measure other variables here, as we were mainly interested by the
effect of temperature. As fragments and replicates of the two populations were placed in the
same water system for a given condition (control or stress), we did not expect any variation
of temperature or other variables inside each condition: the comparison between colonies
rom the two depths has been done in real common garden conditions. Concerning dissolved
oxygen, we used air pumps for a proper oxygenation of the water. See lines 127-156 for the
part dealing with the experimental protocol.
Concerning the measure of differences between survivorship curves at 20 and 40 m, the use
of a parametric Weibull model, which includes Gaussian assumption, allowed to draw 95 %
confidence ellipses for the parameters and therefore to compare the replicates and
conditions. The corresponding probabilities had already been computed in the previous
version (lines 204-210). Maybe this was not clear enough so we modified this part (see lines
175-185 and 237-240) and we included the corresponding figure S2 in the main text (now
Figure 3).
ntroduction
The introduction has all of the right components, but could use attention to organization. As
t stands, the intro contains two large paragraphs; the second paragraph mixes several ideas.
The introduction has been modified with a clearer separation between the main themes.
Watch the use of “envision” throughout the ms. “investigate” or “examine” may be a better
word choice in several cases
We corrected this.
Line 68: what are “variability of scales” and “diversity of responses”?
This has been modified: « Such studies may be rendered more challenging by the different
spatial scales at which contrasted responses to climate change can be observed within species.
»
Line 104: What type of climate change?
We replaced this by «seawater warming».
Material and Methods
Line 111-118: What are the ranges of summer and winter temperatures? What was the
emperature when individuals were collected? Be more specific.
We detailed this on lines 108-117.
Line 125: What were the size of the aquaria? Did all fragments consist of the same size or
number of polyps?
Stress and control conditions were separated in two tank systems: the replicates were placed
andomly in three 24 L tanks for the control and four 18 L tanks for the stress condition.
There was no variation of tank size within each condition. The mean length of the fragments
was 2.24 +/- 0.13 cm (min 1.2, max 4). These points are now detailed in Material and
Methods.
Line 126: Why 16 deg?
This temperature is close to the minimal temperature observed at both depths in summer,
he most stressful season. This is now mentioned in the text.
Line 128: Suggest including these data as supplemental material, as they are important to
your choice of temperature regime.
These data are now included as supplementary material.
Line 131: How did you determine necrosis? Loss of polyps? Blackened tissue? Did you
measure a percentage of the colony affected?
This is now detailed in Materials and Methods: on lines 149-156: « each day necrosis levels
were estimated as the percentage of necrosed tissue. Two types of necrosis were recorded:
partial necrosis when living tissues presented a colour alteration or were partly detached
rom the colony. Full necrosis was recorded when the skeletal axis was visible (Fig. S3). The
percentages of partial and full necrosis for each fragment were estimated by eye with a ruler.
The comparison of these measurements between three observers confirmed the
epeatability of this approach. For the statistical analyses, we focused on the appearance of
necrosis sensu lato: one fragment was considered affected if there was any sign of either
partial or full necrosis. »
Line 139: Were the necrosis statistics created by you? Or is there a citation?
This statistical analysis has been developed here for this study. There is no specific citation
even if the Weibull distribution is widely used for its flexibility to model various survival
processes (see Johnson et al., 1994)
Lines 168-169. Sentence structure is awkward. What is “which a probability of sexual
eproduction p sex.”?
multilocus genotypes (MLG) and to compute the probability p sex of obtaining identical
MLGs through sexual reproduction. »
Lines 178-179. Add use of AMOVA for testing whether Fst differs between the two depths
We performed an AMOVA either based on R ST or on FST. See results and supplementary
material, table S3.
Results
Line 184: Experimental time belongs in methods
This has been corrected.
Line 186: “its basis” Do you mean the baseline dataset? Or the base of the fragment?
The base of the fragment, we corrected this.
Line 187: change “evolve” to “change”
This has been corrected.
Line 189: “very different” is vague. Add a statistical test to determine the level of
significance. Perhaps an ANCOVA?
The significance level of differences is straightfrowardly given by the 95% confidence ellipses
of the Weibull fit achieved for the four replicates (R1 and R2 at 20 m and 40 m respectively;
Fig. 3). This remark matches the one pointed out in the main comment above. We modified
he text accordingly by deleting this sentence in this part while keeping this result for the
statistical analysis. More details have been added in materials and methods as well. See lines
175-185 and 237-240.
Lines 192-193. This is interesting. Are these replicates very different genotypes? Or do you
mean replicates of the same coral colony that were used in the experiment? Perhaps a
sibling or kinship analysis would provide insight.
Replicates are different fragments from the same coral colony (this is mentioned more clearly
n Materials and Methods).
Line 194: Unclear why Weibull distribution was used. More justification would clarify this.
As already mentioned in the text and previously, the Weibull distribution is widely used for
ts flexibility to model various survival processes (see Johnson et al., 1994). Obviously other
distributions can be used for modeling such survival processes. As already pointed out,
Weibull's parameters can easily be connected to biological interpretations . This is mentioned
2010; The Weibull distribution: a handbook. CRC Press, available as Google book)
Lines 212-223: Were their certain lineages or alleles that were present in individuals that
showed responses versus those that did not show response? This could make an interesting
comparison.
The number of loci and individuals is here quite reduced for an association study, but this
could be a perspective based on other genotyping approaches (e.g. NGS; we mention the
genomic approach as a perspective in conclusion).
Discussion
Discussion is quite good. Minor changes necessary, but I do suggest the authors take another
ook at editing sentence structure and word choice.
We edited the discussion. We focused on shorter and more direct sentences, and the whole
article has been corrected by a native English speaker.
Line 232: “quite far” is awkward
Corrected.
Line 233: How do you know this?
We modified this sentence: «This could suggest that shallow populations may live far from
heir thermotolerance limits but such experimental results can differ from in situ
hermotolerance levels.»
Line 237: In what species was mortality observed? And if mortality was observed at 22 deg,
why not use this threshold?
We indicate that three octocoral species have been considered in this article, including E.
cavolini. We did not use this threshold, as in aquarium our preliminary experiment and the
main experiment indicate that 22°C is probably not an adequate temperature to observe
necrosis events. The reasons for this are discussed in the same part of the discussion (Lines
270-282).
Lines 259-263. If different stress protocols were used, how can you be sure that the response
differences are not due to methods? Suggest re-wording or removing.
We agree that this is an important point and we modified this part accordingly.
Figures
suggest removing Figure 1 to supplemental material.

Comments to the Author(s)
Dabat-Pivotto and co-authors studied the vertical variability of response to thermal stress as
well as vertical genetic differentiation in an octocoral. The approach is really interesting and
nnovative, as it combines the study of thermotolerance and population genetics. The
questions addressed are of major importance, in the present context of global warming. The
study is well executed and the analysis are sound. However, there is a major problem in
presenting the results and analysis, which is most likely linked with the fact English is not the
natal language of the authors. There is a clear need for the authors to have the text edited by
someone who is fluent in English. In its present form, the text is unclear, and I just could not
understand some sentences. I am fully aware of the difficulty for non-English speakers to
write in English, and I can certainly relate to this issue. However, the problem is too
mportant here to be ignored.
The article has been corrected by a native English speaker.
n some sections, the authors tend to oversell their results a little. For example, they talk
about “Evolution of thermotolerance” when no phylogenetic data is provided.
The discussion has been modified to take this into account (see below).
The methods section needs to integrate a paragraph describing the model in terms of life
history, distribution, etc. Clarification is also needed about aquarium system used.
As mentioned in the response to reviewer 1, we provide more details on the experimental
protocols. Concerning the species, we added a specific paragraph as suggested here.
n the results section, authors need to present data from the “control” treatment for
adequate comparison.
The results from the control treatment are now integrated in Figure 1.
The discussion section is the one that needs English editing the most. It is really hard to
understand.
The discussion has been rewritten and corrected.
The reference section also needs more effort. In some references, the first letter of each
word of the title is capitalised and in others this is not the case. Some references have doi,
others don't. Some references don’t even have a title. The books are not correctly cited, and
some citations are clearly incomplete (2, 25, 42, 47, for example).
The references have been corrected.
We answer to these comments below.
As a conclusion, I would recommend rejecting the article in its present form, and would
advise the authors to resubmit a significantly amended version of their work.
Best regards,
Responses to reviewer 2
We have done all the minor corrections suggested by reviewer 2, here are the detailed
esponses to other comments :
In the introduction, we deleted the sentence concerning genetic drift which was not crucial
or the introduction.
Concerning the term « corals » and their ecological importance : we now define that we use
his term as « anthozoans ». The ecological importance of the studied species, and mode
generally of several Mediterranean octocorals, is mentioned in various articles, and we cite
one of them (Coma et al., 2006). We mention these species as « ecologically important
species ».
We agree that by studying only one species we cannot study the evolution of adaptation in
octocorals. We modified this and propose a comparative analysis of adaptation for species
with different dispersal abilities. We also modified several parts of the discussion accordingly.
We detail the experimental conditions in aquaria (lines 127-156).
For the definition of Tau: the distribution function of a random variable T is defined as the
probability that T<t. This probability P(T<t) is the integral of the density f T between -8 and a
value t. It is then not possible to use the symbol t in an integral where a boundary is also t.
Tau is only the argument of the function into the integral : it can be replaced by any sign.
The necrosis data for the control experiment are presented on Fig.1 (formerly Fig. 2)
The 95% confidence ellipses are presented on Fig. 3 (formerly Fig. S2)
In the discussion we deleted the comparison with intertidal species
We now mention in the abstract the interest of our results for on a species without
Symbiodinium
eported for this species. For another Mediterranean octocoral, dedicated did not evidence
any genetic heterogeneity inside colonies (Ledoux J.B., 2010, PhD thesis).
We acknowledge that other examples of intra-colony variation have been observed in the
esponse to thermal stress. We modified the text accordingly and we added another
eference.
We clarified our reference to generation time: «Octocorals can present sexual maturity
after several years (e.g. [53]). Generation time will then constitute a limiting factor to an
evolutionary response to climate change for these species.»

ally enjoyed this study and was looking forward to reading a revised version. The authors have
ressed most of my comments. However, their additions have raised a few more questions and
es that need attention. I am most concerned with the fact that there could be a tank effect,
ch could lead to the different responses observed between replicates of the same coral colony.
wever, I think this can be addressed by more details in the text and more data. I am curious if
replicates 1 and 2 from each of 20 m and 40 m correspond to certain tanks? If so, I do not think
have ruled out a tank effect. I think it is important to compare the necrosis response curves
ween the tanks for specimens from each depth. It is very curious to me that hazard functions
replicates-2 are lower than replicates-1 from both depths. I would not expect to see this in the
ence of a tank effect.
erent tanks, but replicates from different depths were present in the same tanks. This is now
icated in Material and Methods : « The tanks corresponding to the same experimental condition
ntrol or stress) were connected to the same water filtration system in order to focus on the
iability linked to the different colonies or fragments. » The analysis of the survivor curves (with
95 % confidence intervals associated with the Weibull function) do not indicate a difference
ween tanks for replicates from the same depth. Only one tank(C5) indicated a difference
ween fragments from other tanks for the 20 m depths, but the same tank did not display such
erences for fragments from the 40 m depths. If a tank effect was present it would be restricted
this tank and only for the 20 m fragments. This is now presented in the results part and we
cuss the possibility of a replicate effect or a tank effect or an interaction between tanks and
licates (see below).
m also concerned with the interpretation of the AMOVA results. However, the paragraph
ailing the population genetics was poorly written, so it left me somewhat confused. I am most
cerned that you found significant (p=0.036) FST and FSC (p=0.043) (Table S3) between samples
ected at 20 m with those collected at 40 m. If so, this suggests genetic differentiation between
two depths (alebit weakly differentiated). I think you need to re-examine these results and also
ude STRUCTURE analyses to corroborate your findings.
FSC corresponds to differentiation between samples within groups. Therefore this indicates
erences between samples from the same detph, not between depth. As indicated in the results,
re is a weak but significant differentiation between experimental and in situ samples at 40 m
not at 20 m. Differentiation between depths is studied throuh F CT which was not significant. We
o performed a new AMOVA analysis without the locus Ever009 and no comparison remained
ificant in that case and we now mention this point. We also performed a STRUCTURE analysis
suggested : these results are presented in supplementary material. No genetic structure was
denced by this approach, whatever the number of clusters (from 1 to 5). Therefore we did not
ly any method aiming at estimating the best K value (such as Delta(K)), but we present the
ts of membership in supplementary material.
ink the study is novel enough for publication in this journal and will be of interest to a wide
ience. Overall, this is an interesting study, and I recommend it for publication after addressing
se further issues. See below for additional comments:

added a STRUCTURE analysis in supplementary material (K 1-5) : this did not reveal any genetic
cture. This is briefly mentioned in the results as well.

he end of this part of the results, we added this sentence : « An analysis of survivor curves per
ks and per depth indicated that fragments from 20 m in the C5 tank showed necrosis sooner
faster than fragments from the same depth in other tanks (Fig. S5). This was not observed for
fragments from 40 m in this C5 tank when compared to other fragments from the same

mention this (see above).
Gen Section: More details would be helpful and attention to text is needed. What was the
ge in number of alleles? Were there any private alleles in samples from each depth? Were any
he loci out of HWE?
milar levels of genetic diversity were observed for the 20 m and 40 m samples (including
erimental and in situ samples) with Hexp = 0.56 at 20 m and 0.55 at 40 m (Table S2). The
mber of alleles per locus and per depth ranged from 2 to 8, with a mean value over the nine loci
.2 at 20 m and 5.4 at 40 m (Table S2). Tests of adequation to Hardy-Weinberg proportion were
significant in most cases, apart from locus EC24 at both depths and S14 at 20 m for which
icits of heterozygotes were observed. Significant heterozygote deficits were also observed for
multilocus test at each depth. Four alleles were private to one depth: two at 20 m and two at
m with a maximum frequency of these private alleles reaching 0.04 (data not shown). »

ne
es 246-247. What are “all other comparisons?” How does this differ from the next sentence as
state for all other analyses except AMOVA samples were grouped by depth? This is really
fusing. Did you not test whether the FST differed between the samples collected from 20 m
h those collected from 40 m using all 9 loci? I think the wording and the organization is making
section more confusing than it needs to be.
s part has been modified accordingly.
cussion
nd it very interesting that there was a mass mortality event at 22 deg yet only ~5% necrosis
erimentally for individuals at 20 m. To me, it seems most plausible that this is due to pathogens
other fouling fauna present in the natural environment. In this first paragraph, this is
ntioned. Are there any studies that can support these findings? That would provide strength to
point in the discussion.
occurrence of pathogens has already been demonstrated for another Mediterranean
ocoral, Paramuricea clavata, as already mentioned (Bally & Garrabou, 2008). We now mention
ther study on the congeneric species E. verrucosa in the North Sea, where a modification of
terial communities could be linked to necrosis (Ransome et al. 2014).
es 297-298. This sentence “This apparently did not induce differences in necrosis threshold
ween depths under common conditions for E. singularis” is confusing. What is “this”? And what
mon conditions?
s sentence has been modified : « Nevertheless there was no differences in necrosis threshold
ween depths for E. singularis ».
es 298-304: Although the feeding differences may be a possibility, it seems unlikely to me that
would cause such a difference. Is it possible that the differences could be due to different
ths of the samples?
depths were quite similar : 15 / 35 m for the articles on E. singularis and 20 / 40 m in our
e 329: what is s.s. ??
su stricto : we corrected this and explicitely mention genetic adaptation.
es 333-339: I am not convinced of this argument. You state that high gene flow would limit the
on of local selection. However, adaptive divergence in the presence of gene flow could still
ur. You sampled very few loci across the genome. There could be several others that are under
ection, which could maintain some of the differences. I suggest re-thinking this argument.
agree with this comment and we modified the text to take this into account.
e 346: wide diversity of response? Where are the data for this?
modified this sentence : « Our observation of a wide range in necrosis time (see Fig.1) indicates
versity of response between individuals from the same depth. »
es 358-361: Again, looking at necrosis levels between tanks would strengthen this finding.
s part has been modified to take into account the possibility of a tank effect :
he observed differences between replicates suggest either a tank effect or thermotolerance
erences within colonies. The marginal distributions of the shape parameter of the Weibull
ard function showed no difference between replicates at 40 m but significant differences
ween replicates at 20 m (Fig. 3). The shape parameter is the most important in the Weibull
ard function since it mainly controls the rate of increasing risk. The replicates were randomly
ributed between tanks connected to a common water system but different replicates were
sent in different tanks and the survivor curves indicated a difference for 20 m fragments in one
k. Even if one could expect an exposure to the same water parameters between tanks, including
perature, a tank effect can not be excluded. Nevertheless this tank effect would have to be
cific of the 20 m depth as it was not observed at 40 m. Another interpretation would be that
se differences are due to an intra-colony variability of response. This has been demonstrated
several hexacorals, for example depending on location within the colony [50,51]. Here we did
have any information on the original orientation of the fragment but such differences could be
ed to differences in food availability, in the age of the branches or to previous injuries from
dators or pathogens, even if colonies were healthy when sampled. This intra-individual
iability would provide an additional level of adaptation by allowing the survival of a colony
ough differential impact of thermal stress along its branches. Additional tests taking into
ount the orientation of the fragments in situ and their position in the colony will be required to
further with this line of inquiry. They should be performed in common tanks. Our results indeed
erline the interest of replicates from the same individuals for experimental studies on colonial
anisms. »
e 364: This is interesting. Was the health of all the colonies checked prior to the experiment?
colonies were healthy, we now mention this (see previous response).
e 366-368. What does “initial position mean”? Confusing
