I have read the manuscript by Gera and Salac on "Stochastic Phase Segregation on Surfaces". This
is an excellent paper and it certainly deserves to be published in Royal Society Open Science. The
strengths of the paper are the following:
1. In my opinion, this is more of a "method" paper. The introduction summarises why this work is
interesting and can be useful for a variety of problems. Sections II and III also provide sufficient
details on implementation. The range of advanced techniques used is quite impressive and
highlights the difficulty in studying phase separation dynamics on curved surfaces. Finally, it is
pleasing that the code is available online.
2. The test problem on a sphere provides some unexpected results. In particular, it is really
interesting that fluctuations influence the phase separation dynamics differently for constant and
variable mobilities. The analysis provided is quite convincing to explain these behaviours. On this
note, I wonder if the authors have tried other forms of variable mobility, such that fluctuations do
not dominate diffusion far from the interface (in the context of discussion around Fig. 8). In that
case, do larger fluctuations increase or decrease the exponent?
I have a few other minor comments that should be addressed prior to publication:
1. On page 13, I believe it is better to say “The primary means of coarsening in this case is
Ostwald ripening” rather than spinodal decomposition.
2. Have the authors benchmark their code such that the exponent approaches 1/3 as the sphere
radius goes to infinity (the flat surface limit, for CH model)?
3. For the dumbbell case, at the intersection between the spheres and the cylinder, the curvature
is infinite (the surface tangent is discontinuous). Can the authors comment if this is an issue in
their approach?
4. Can the authors comment on finite size effect? When does the scaling breakdown, in relation to
the size of the domain vs the sphere radius?

In this manuscript, authors present a numerical study of the phase segregation and coarsening on
a curved surface using the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook model. The manuscript is well written and I think
should be published, after following comments are properly addressed.
1. I think it would be useful to note that what authors refer to as surface divergence and gradient
are also known as covariant derivatives. I suggest writing those quantities using the standard
notation in differential geometry that involves Christoffel Symbol. In general, using a more
modern language of differential geometry of surfaces would be helpful.
2. Authors model dumbbells as two spheres connected by a cylinder. At the intersection of the
cylinder with both spheres, the curvature diverges. How is that handled?
3. What happens in the case of surfaces with negative Gaussian curvature (e.g., a catenoid) or
with surfaces of higher genus, such as torus? For completeness, a brief discussion would be
useful.

Appendix A
Referee I:
Comment: The test problem on a sphere provides some unexpected results. In particular, it is really
interesting that fluctuations influence the phase separation dynamics differently for constant and
variable mobilities. The analysis provided is quite convincing to explain these behaviors. On this note, I
wonder if the authors have tried other forms of variable mobility, such that fluctuations do not dominate
diffusion far from the interface (in the context of discussion around Fig. 8). In that case, do larger
fluctuations increase or decrease the exponent?
Response: We have only tested the two mobility forms. To address the possibility that the form of
mobility may play a large role in the growth rate, the sentence ``Note that other forms of mobility, for
example one which does not decrease as quickly away from the interface, may result in different
dynamics." on page 20.
Comment: On page 13, I believe it is better to say “The primary means of coarsening in this case is
Ostwald ripening” rather than spinodal decomposition.
Response: This issue has been addressed,
Comment: Have the authors benchmark their code such that the exponent approaches 1/3 as the sphere
radius goes to infinity (the flat surface limit, for CH model)?
Response: For flat surfaces, the coarsening rate is does approach 1/3. However as formal study of 64
realizations has not been performed for this case it was not included in the manuscript.
Comment: For the dumbbell case, at the intersection between the spheres and the cylinder, the
curvature is infinite (the surface tangent is discontinuous). Can the authors comment if this is an issue
in their approach?
Response: We have not observed any issues. In most cases values are not computed directly at this
location, as it does not usually correspond to the closest point of a grid point.
Comment: Can the authors comment on finite size effect? When does the scaling breakdown, in relation
to the size of the domain vs the sphere radius?
Response: Due to the constant curvature of a sphere, the rate of coarsening on a sphere scales as
$0.2814$ for a certain time period. This scaling breaks down when domains grow large, equal in size,
and when the domain radius approaches values on the order of the interface radius. This has been noted
by adding ``It should also be noted that as the size of the domains becomes large compared to the
radius of the underlying shape, the coarsening rate may further decrease." on page 16.
Referee II:
Comment: I think it would be useful to note that what authors refer to as surface divergence and
gradient are also known as covariant derivatives. I
suggest writing those quantities using the standard notation in differential geometry that involves
Christoffel Symbol. In general, using a more modern language of differential geometry of surfaces would
be helpful.
Response: Definitions using Christoffel Symbol has been added to the text.
Comment: Authors model dumbbells as two spheres connected by a cylinder. At the intersection of the
cylinder with both spheres, the curvature diverges. How is that handled?
Response: We have not observed any issues. In most cases values are not computed directly at this
location, as it does not usually correspond to the closest point of a grid point.
Comment: What happens in the case of surfaces with negative Gaussian curvature (e.g., a catenoid) or
with surfaces of higher genus, such as torus? For completeness, a brief discussion would be useful.
Response: This has been addressed by adding ``In this work, it has been established that the
underlying curvature of the surface does play a role on the domain coarsening. For a Cahn-Hilliard case
with constant unit mobility, the growth rate remains close to $1/3$. For surfaces with negative Gaussian
curvatures, or surfaces with higher genus are expected to coarsen in a similar manner. However, when
noise is added and mobility is no longer constant, varying behaviors can be expected. The authors will
formally investigate this in future work." to the conclusion.
