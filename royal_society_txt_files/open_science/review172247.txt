In the manuscript entitled “First-principles calculations of Structural, Electronic, magnetic and
elastic properties of Mo2FeB2 based cermets under high pressure” the authors used a density
functional theory to obtain results on those properties of the Mo2FeB2 under high pressure
mentioned in the title. The calculations presented in this manuscript are routine. Please, find
below my comments/questions on the manuscript.
1. In general, the English should be improved. Please make an effort to improve the English.
2. The introduction seems to be so length. I advise the authors to simplify them.
3. The authors should provide the crystal structure for Mo2FeB2 based cermets in the section of
Method of computation.
4. The authors should give description about the crystal structure of Mo2FeB2 based cermets in
the section of crystal structure under pressure. (Crystal system, space group and their atomic
positions).
5. Why the rapid change occurs around 40 GPa? Rapid decrease in bond length occurs. why?
Check the calculation.(Fig.1)
6. In Fig2, one could not see the difference in DOS for higher pressure. Check your computation.
7. The authors should give detailed explanation about the charge changes of Mo and B under
pressure. Authors should give reliable explanation on this.
8. The purpose of magnetic properties for this Mo2FeB2 based cermets is not entirely clear
though. The authors are advised to change this part.
9. As the pressure increases, the magnetic moment decreases.But at 100GPa, once again magnetic
moment increases. Why? Give the reason
10. Fig.9 is not clear. The explanation for thermodynamic change should be elaborate.

Dear Dr. Wang,
Thank you very much for your interest to our journal. It is my pleasure to inform you that I
suggest to accept your manuscript with minor revisions.
Based on the comments of the reviewer, I carefully read your manuscript one more time and saw
that modifying some expressions may help improve the language of your paper. Especially, the
expressions such as "bonds increase..." etc. need to be revised to what you really would like to
refer (like bonds strengthen, shorten, lengthen, etc.). We hope to receive your revised manuscript
in a short time and proceed further.

have tried our best to revise our manuscript according to the comments. By responding to these in
detail, we believe the manuscript has been significantly strengthened.
1. In general, the English should be improved. Please make an effort to improve the
English.
Reply to the reviewer:
Thank you very much for raising this good suggestion, which would be useful for our future study.
We will try our best to improve the ability of writing in English. All the revised places are marked
in red in the paper.
2. The introduction seems to be so length. I advise the authors to simplify them.
Reply to the reviewer:
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the introduction is simplified. The changes are listed below.
(1) “Several surface techniques have been employed to prepare the Mo2FeB2 based cermet coatings.
The primary synthesis methods are reactive boride brazing, reaction sintering, flame spraying,
and electrospark deposition.” in paragraph 1 Page 2 is deleted.
(2) “He et al. investigated the mechanical properties, electronic structure and thermodynamic
properties of the Mo2XB2 and MoX2B4 (X=Fe, Co, Ni) ternary borides with first-principles
methods, and among these, Mo2FeB2 was found to exhibit the largest shear and Young’s moduli
owing to its strong chemical bonding.” is changed to “He et al. found that Mo2FeB2 exhibit the
largest shear and Young’s moduli owing to its strong chemical bonding among the Mo2XB2 and
MoX2B4 (X=Fe, Co, Ni) ternary borides with first-principles methods.”
(3) “Lin et al. investigated the structural stability, elastic properties and electronic structure of
Mo2FeB2 with Cr, Ni and Mn doping. It was found that Cr, Ni and Mn prefer to occupy the Fe
atom site of Mo2FeB2.” is deleted.
3. The authors should provide the crystal structure for Mo2FeB2 based cermets in the
section of Method of computation.
Reply to the reviewer:
“In this work, the unit cell which contains 4 Mo atoms, 2 Fe atoms and 4 B atoms, with periodic
boundary conditions was used. Mo2FeB2 with tetragonal symmetry belongs to the P4/mbm space
group.” was added in Page 3 line 20.
4. The authors should give description about the crystal structure of Mo2FeB2 based
cermets in the section of crystal structure under pressure. (Crystal system, space group
and their atomic positions).
Reply to the reviewer:
“According to the whole calculation, Mo2FeB2 keep the tetragonal symmetry and P4/mbm
space group. Furthermore, the atom almost keep the same fractional coordiantes, and the
biggest displacement (fractional coordinates) is less than 2% (supporting data).” is added
in the Page 4 line 4.
5.Why the rapid change occurs around 40 GPa? Rapid decrease in bond length occurs.
why? Check the calculation.(Fig.1)
Reply to the reviewer:
I’m sorry for the mistakes of the data for 30 GPa and 40 GPa, and it has been corrected in Fig.1.
The words “Furthermore, the V/V0 decreases sharply between 30 and 40 GPa, meaning that the
volume showed a great change when the pressure reached 40 GPa. That change is due to the rapid
decrease in the B-Mo bond strength, as will be discussed below.” are deleted.
6. In Fig. 2, one could not see the difference in DOS for higher pressure. Check your
computation.
Reply to the reviewer:
We have seriously checked the DOS data, and we seriously apologize for the mistakes of the data
of 50 GPa and 100 GPa. Now, they are corrected.
7. The authors should give detailed explanation about the charge changes of Mo and B
under pressure. Authors should give reliable explanation on this.
Reply to the reviewer:
With the pressure increases, the electrons in outer shell transfer to the inner shell. However, it has
little to do with the analysis of the bonding. Thus, we decide to delete the corresponding paragraph
and the Table.
8. The purpose of magnetic properties for this Mo2FeB2 based cermets is not entirely clear
though. The authors are advised to change this part.
Reply to the reviewer:
“As the magnetic properties have significant impact on the crystal structures[1], the magnetic
properties of ground state should be decided.” The words are added in Page 6 line 17.
9. As the pressure increases, the magnetic moment decreases. But at 100GPa, once again magnetic
moment increases. Why? Give the reason
Reply to the reviewer:
I’m sorry for making the mistake for the wrong data in Table 3. We filled the data of Hirshfeld
Analysis but not the data of Mulliken Analysis. Now, we have corrected the data in Table 3 which
adopted the data of Mulliken Analysis.
10. Fig.9 is not clear. The explanation for thermodynamic change should be elaborate.
Reply to the reviewer:
In Fig.9, the lines for different temperatures almost overlap. Thus, it is hard to distinguish.
Furthermore, explanation for thermodynamic change are strengthened which marked in red.
Many thanks for all of the insightful and careful review!

1. The most of the figures are de-normalized, please provide a much more formal ones.
In addition, the x-coordinate of Fig.4 and the y-coordinate of Fig. 10(b) are missing.
Reply to the reviewer:
All the figures are checked again, and all the figures are replaced with formal ones again.
Furthermore, Fig.4, Fig.10 and Fig. 11 are amended.
2. There are some small language errors that make it not easy to follow. Please check
the whole manuscript carefully.

Reply to Reviewer #3:
First of all, we would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive comments and suggestions. By
responding to these in detail, we believe the manuscript has been significantly strengthened.
1. Hardness judging from shear modulus is not accurate, Please further calculate the
theoretical hardness.
Reply to the reviewer:
We had tried Gao’s method [2] to calculate the hardness of Mo2FeB2 under different pressures,
which are listed in the table below. According to the Gao’s method, the weakest bond decided the
hardness. Thus, the values marked in blue are the final hardness for Mo2FeB2 under different
pressures. It is found that the hardness first increase then decrease. Furthermore, when the pressure
exceeds 90 GPa, the hardness becomes minus, which is inconsistent with the change of elastic
modulus. As B, G and E increase monotonically with the pressure, the hardness is supposed to have
the similar trend. Thus, we didn’t put the calculation of hardness in the paper.

2. The used model for calculation is not enough clear, and if the original cell is applied in
calculation, the parameter of shear energy 330ev is not enough to achieve convergence,
please do convergence test.
Reply to the reviewer:
In this work, the unit cell with periodic boundary conditions was used. which contains 4 Mo atoms,
2 Fe atoms and 4 B atoms. Mo2FeB2 with tetragonal symmetry belongs to the P4/mbm space group.
Furthermore, the corresponding words are added in the Page 3. The elastic modulus convergence
test for different cutoff energy had been done, and the results are listed in the table below. From the
table, it is found the biggest error is between the value of 330eV and 430eV for B, which is less than
3.5%. Thus, we think the 330eV for cutoff energy is enough for convergence for elastic modulus.

3. Little obtained experimental results or reference data occurred in your manuscript, so,
how to confirm your calculated results is accurate.
Reply to the reviewer:
We compared our present data with other theoretical and experimental ones in Table 1 (Table 1 is
newly added). “The largest error is less than 1.6% between the volume V0 obtained by our
calculations and the experimental data of Gladyshevskii[3].” The corresponding words are also
added in Page 3 last paragraph.
4. In your manuscript, the up of the 3d orbit of Fe is 1.79 and down is -1.79 when no
pressure is applied, which is obvious difference with your previous published paper that
the up of the 3d orbit of Fe is 4.29 and down is -2.836, why?
Reply to the reviewer:
In previous paper, the up of the 3d orbit of Fe is 4.288 hbar/2 and down is -2.327 hbar/2, which
refers to only one Fe atom. That is, the magnetic moment is 1.96 hbar/2 for one Fe 3d. Furthermore,
the total magnetic moment for one Fe atom is 2.053 hbar/2 which is close to the data 2.04 hbar/2.
Besides, we have corrected the data in Table 3 which adopted the data of Mulliken Analysis instead
of the data of Hirshfeld Analysis. In Table 3, up and down refers to the total magnetic moments of
two Fe atoms. That’s because the unit cell of Mo2FeB2 contains two Fe atoms.
Many thanks for all of the insightful and careful review!
