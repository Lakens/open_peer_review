Comments to the Author(s)

I really enjoyed reading this interesting manuscript on human face processing and learning in
domestic sheep, which provides the reader with new insights into sheep’ ability to discriminate
and recognize previously unfamiliar human faces. In their experiment, the authors confronted
sheep with a two-choice task where subjects initially needed to learn to discriminate between
human faces and blank screens, objects, or unrewarded novel unfamiliar faces. In a final test,
sheep identified the learned familiar faces even if they were presented in a tilted perspective.
They were also able to identify the 2D image of one of their handlers, indicating elaborated
processing abilities for recognizing humans. I think that this research is a nice addition to the
existing literature in this area. However, there are some major points that the authors need to
address:
First, the authors need to address alternative explanations for their results. Their results could be,
for example, explained by sheep’s reaction to novelty (novel stimuli were never rewarded, so
subjects might just avoid or learned to avoid novel stimuli). More importantly, the authors also
fail to address that the performance in the tests (new perspectives of learned familiar images and
handler image) could be also explained by rapid learning rather than recognition of familiar faces
(see below).
Second, there is much room for improvement in terms of the terminology used and the
structuring of the methods and results section. Specifically, the manuscript needs more
consistency and clarification in terms of its terminology. The authors should clarify the
distinction between recognition and differentiation (see Tibbets et al 2007, Coulon et al. 2009 vs
Coulon et al. 2011). Both terms seem to be used interchangeably throughout the introduction and
methods (see 1st and 4th paragraph in Introduction, as well as last paragraph when outlining
procedure and goals of experiment). I also found the authors’ use of the word ‘probe trials’ rather
confusing – probe trials, to my knowledge, are either always or never rewarded to avoid learning
effects (see your reference 36), and are often interspersed between rewarded training trials. This
term is used throughout the manuscript, but according to the ESM videos and brief sentences in
the methods and the results, subjects have been rewarded for a correct choice (but not incorrect
choices) in these trials. It is, however, not clear from the methods whether only the learned front
faces have been rewarded. Did the same apply to the faces in the tilted perspective? If yes, did
you find a learning effect in the test sessions (which would be quite likely as subjects appear to
have learned rapidly to discriminate two faces over training).

The methods and results sections are not appropriately structured. Most importantly, the
methods section lacks crucial information on the test design and procedure: Quite a lot of
information seems to be placed in the ESM. Please put the statistics and analysis section into the
main manuscript, as well as what parameters were recorded and how (choice and reaction time).
This is crucial information for the reader and should not be ‘hidden’ in the ESM. The general
methods need to provide more detailed information, e.g., it is not clear from the start how long
each training took and whether all subjects received all four potential rewarded images, how
much unfamiliar images (S(-)) have been used, why this particular (and very liberal) learning
3
criterium was chosen -> see detailed comments. A lot of this is later reported in the results
section. The results section itself seems to be mingled with a lot of text that should belong into the
methods and the discussion section. Please only state plain results in this section and keep it
concise.
Because of the outlined points above, I cannot recommend this manuscript for publication in
Royal Society Open Science yet. It would suggest a major revision of the manuscript in terms of
its structure, the details provided, and (a more critical) interpretation of the data.
I am very much looking forward to reading an improved version of this interesting and
promising piece of research.

Detailed comments
- There is no line numbering, which makes it a bit hard to specify detailed comments. Please
include these in a revised version
- Please rename the file name of the supplementary methods to the corresponding journal
- I would recommend adding ‘in 2D images’ or similar wording to the title to represent what has
been done in a more appropriate way
Abstract
• ‘has been only shown in humans’ – but you discuss the findings of reference 36 on capuchin
monkeys later one which used a similar setup
• ‘with whom they were familiar from photographs’ – ambiguous writing, not clear if sheep were
familiar with the handler because they know him from photographs
• “identified the handler”
Introduction
• Line 1: “young humans” sounds odd. Please specify.
• Line 2: the authors in reference 2 did not test ‘young humans’ (except you refer to college
students?). Reference 3 focuses more on social communication.
• 2nd paragraph: delete second bracket behind “sheep (25)”
• The end of the 4th paragraph should also highlight the results of Pierce et al 2001 (cited in the
1st paragraph) to provide a more complete picture
• 4th paragraph, last line: it is not clear why this reference is used here. In my opinion, a
reference about the difference between differentiation vs recognition or a review on face
recognition would be more appropriate.
• Last paragraph, Line 3: ‘to learn to recognize’? Wasn’t training supposed to test whether they
differentiate between images, while probe trials to test for whether they recognize the learned
familiar faces in a different perspective?
Methods
• Could you provide a little bit more information on the subjects’ history and test background?
Have they been successful (i.e. good learners) in previous discrimination tasks? Are these eight
subjects the only animals in the flock or are they kept with other subjects (probably non-learners
4
in previous tasks)? What was their feeding regime? At what time of day have they been exposed
to the tests? Have testing times been randomized over individuals and days? What was the
reward for correct choices?
• If subjects reached the criterion, were they directly transferred to the next Training phase or did
they participate in the full four sessions?
• It would be great to see an additional Figure depicturing the test apparatus and system
• 2nd paragraphs, line 3: not clear whether this applies to a week, a Training set, or the total
experiment. Supplements say that sheep received 12-16 trials, but here you state it was always 12
trials. Please clarify.
• 2nd paragraphs, line 5: more ‘taught to differentiate between four unfamiliar faces from
different unfamiliar faces’?
• 3rd paragraph, line 4: how did you choose four sessions maximum for each training? Although
all the sheep reached criterion in the given time, the amount of total trials (48) seems rather low
compared to other experiments in discrimination learning experiments in ungulates.
• 3rd paragraph, line 4: so each sheep received all potential S(+) images? It is implied in this
sentence here, but this wasn’t clear before.
• End of page 5: how many S(-) images were available? How likely was it that subjects have seen
the same stimulus twice or more? I am wondering whether sheep might have learned to avoid
novel stimuli rather than simply approaching rewarded ones.
• End of 3rd paragraph: 14 correction trials when administering 12 trials per session in total? This
is quite a lot.
• End of 3rd paragraph: ‘70% correct in 20 trials’: Please also state the exact trial number here
(14). 14 out of 20 trials correct does not provide a p value below 0.05. How did you come up with
this criterion? Does it also imply that performance across up to 3 sessions was accounted? See
also the discrepancy from what is provided in Figure 1.
• I would find it interesting to see whether subjects differed in their reaction time depending on
whether they have made a correct or incorrect choice (see Proops et al. 2010 and Nawroth et al.
2013).
• Is there a reason why you used a tilted perspective from a frontal left or right view, but no
profile pictures of the celebrities (see e.g. Coulon et al. 2009 for cattle)
• In terms of the probe trials with the image of their handler, I could not find information on why
this particular handler was chosen and how the daily (positive) interactions between this handler
and the sheep looked like.

Results
• There is an inconsistency in capitalizing ‘Training’ throughout the ms.
• How are SEM of 0.02-0.1% possible throughout Training 1-3, but for probe trials they increased
to up to 7.5%. What was happening here?
• Please avoid using ‘in hindsight’
• Last paragraph, last sentence: times in comparison to the probe trials with the images in a tilted
perspective or with the interspersed trials with the front celebrity faces?
5
Discussion
• I miss a more critical discussion on potential factors that might alternatively account for the
performance of your sheep, such as avoidance of novelty or rapid learning in the test trials.
• 1st paragraph, line 4: “only in dimensions from a photograph” sounds odd. Please rephrase.
• 1st paragraph, lines 4-5: I know what you are trying to say here - but you only tested
unfamiliar, not familiar, faces during Training 3, right? I think this sentence should be rephrased
in order to better represent a summary of your findings.
• 1st paragraph, last sentence: what do you mean by advanced? Advanced compared to what?
Please do provide some references here.
• 2nd paragraph, first line: switch ref to (30,31); what is the question mark for? You start the
sentence with same-species paradigms, but refer in brackets to the learning of human images –
please rephrase appropriately.
• 3rd paragraph: It would be great to see a brief discussion on the potential effects that sheep
domestication might have had
• Last paragraph, line 6: ‘are unable to recognize…’
• I would be great to see a concluding paragraph, summarizing the results and stating their
importance for future research in small ruminants (welfare, human-animal interactions,
translational research, etc)
References
• There are frequent formatting errors in the references. E.g., URLs should be deleted.
Figures and Tables
- Figure 1 states a learning criterion of 75%. This is different from the two criterion that are stated
in the methods part. Please explain. Please also state the number of absolute trials for 70 or 75% of
correct choices.
- Figure 3: “Photographs shown…”, delete ‘-‘ in ‘probe-test’.

Overall, I found the topic of this manuscript really interesting and looked forward to reading it.
The standard of writing is generally high, but I also have some suggestions for edits (see below).
The inclusion of the supplement video files really helped my understanding of the Methods and
Results. I am guessing that the manuscript was originally written for Proceedings B and that is
why there is information on Methods in the Supplement Materials. These should be moved into
the main manuscript for RSOS, to improve clarity.
There are many formatting and other errors throughout the Reference list – too many to detail
here. The authors should be more careful before submitting a manuscript like this.
The authors need to include the latest and best research related to this topic.

We were lucky to get expert scholars to review this work; they are clearly very suitable for this
unusual and interesting paper. Both Reviewers think this will make a very interesting
contribution to the literature. Their suggestions for improving the manuscript overlap to an
encouraging extent. I would like to see a brief description of the analysis within the methods
section and descriptive statistics at the beginning of the results section. It will help readers to find
their way about. Every reader will want to know 'what did they do?', 'what statistical test or
analytical approach did they use?' and 'how confident are the authors in what they found?' If
you would like to amend the manuscript, taking Reviewers' comments into account, we will be
very happy to read a revision.

I really enjoyed reading this interesting manuscript on human face processing and learning in
domestic sheep, which provides the reader with new insights into sheep’ ability to discriminate
and recognize previously unfamiliar human faces. In their experiment, the authors confronted
sheep with a two-choice task where subjects initially needed to learn to discriminate between
human faces and blank screens, objects, or unrewarded novel unfamiliar faces. In a final test,
sheep identified the learned familiar faces even if they were presented in a tilted perspective.
They were also able to identify the 2D image of one of their handlers, indicating elaborated
processing abilities for recognizing humans. I think that this research is a nice addition to the

performance of your sheep, such as avoidance of novelty or rapid learning in the test trials.

RSOS-171228. Sheep recognise familiar and unfamiliar human faces.
Overall, I found the topic of this manuscript really interesting and looked forward to reading it.
The standard of writing is generally high, but I also have some suggestions for edits (see below).
The inclusion of the supplement video files really helped my understanding of the Methods and
Results. I am guessing that the manuscript was originally written for Proceedings B and that is
why there is information on Methods in the Supplement Materials. These should be moved into
the main manuscript for RSOS, to improve clarity.
There are many formatting and other errors throughout the Reference list – too many to detail
here. The authors should be more careful before submitting a manuscript like this.
The authors need to include the latest and best research related to this topic.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
This is a really nice example of an interesting study, constructive reviewing, and attentive
revision that has yielded a super manuscript at the end of the process.
I suggest one small change that could be done at proof-reading stage perhaps. In line 229
"consistent to the literature' should be changed to 'consistent with the literature'.
Well done on a very nice paper.

ssociate Editor's comments:
We were lucky to get expert scholars to review this work; they are clearly very suitable for this unusual
nd interesting paper. Both Reviewers think this will make a very interesting contribution to the
terature. Their suggestions for improving the manuscript overlap to an encouraging extent. I would like
o see a brief description of the analysis within the methods section and descriptive statistics at the
eginning of the results section. It will help readers to find their way about. Every reader will want to
now 'what did they do?', 'what statistical test or analytical approach did they use?' and 'how confident
re the authors in what they found?' If you would like to amend the manuscript, taking Reviewers'
omments into account, we will be very happy to read a revision.
E: Thank you for this comment and for the helpful reviewer's comments. We have restructured the
ethod section and have now included subsections on Animals, Paradigm, Operating system,
rogramming, Statistics, and Stimuli (see p.5-9). As you suggest, we have added a brief description of
he analysis within the methods section and also of the descriptive statistics at the beginning of the
esults section. We have extended the discussion of our data in order to include additional explanations
f our data and discuss them in the light of the current literature. We have also added another video
hat directly addresses the comment of Reviewer 1 about whether or not the sheep were responding to
ovelty, and a figure depicting the operant system (Figure 1) also in direct response to Reviewer 1.
omments to Author:
eviewers' Comments to Author:
eviewer: 1
really enjoyed reading this interesting manuscript on human face processing and learning in domestic
heep, which provides the reader with new insights into sheep’ ability to discriminate and recognize
reviously unfamiliar human faces. In their experiment, the authors confronted sheep with a two-choice
ask where subjects initially needed to learn to discriminate between human faces and blank screens,
bjects, or unrewarded novel unfamiliar faces. In a final test, sheep identified the learned familiar faces
ven if they were presented in a tilted perspective. They were also able to identify the 2D image of one
f their handlers, indicating elaborated processing abilities for recognizing humans. I think that this
esearch is a nice addition to the existing literature in this area.
E: We are pleased the reviewer enjoyed reading our paper, and thank them for the useful comments.
owever, there are some major points that the authors need to address:
irst, the authors need to address alternative explanations for their results. Their results could be, for
xample, explained by sheep’s reaction to novelty (novel stimuli were never rewarded, so subjects
might just avoid or learned to avoid novel stimuli)….
E: Thank you for this comment. This is an interesting point.
t is true, that at both training 2 and training 3 stages, where the sheep are rewarded for choosing the
elebrity face rather than the object or novel face, it is possible that the sheep are avoiding the novel
timuli. In Training 1, however, the sheep have to choose the picture rather than the black screen. They
re therefore rewarded for picking the (novel) picture, not the (familiar) screen.
ur initial argument would be that this it is unlikely that the sheep were avoiding novelty rather than
hoosing familiarity. First, the performance of the sheep as they learned to discriminate the object and
he face in training 2 was similar to that when they performed two-choice discrimination with two
bjects (Morton and Avanzo, 2011). Second, in the probe-test, the tilted faces of the celebrities include
ovel aspects, such as a different hairstyle or a different facial expression as well as a different angle.
hus, if the sheep were simply avoiding novelty, both images would be 'novel'. We acknowledge,
owever, that these are fairly weak arguments.
While we think the sheep are choosing the familiar, rather than avoiding novelty, because of the way
hey respond to the picture, the reviewers comment highlights an aspect of the behaviour that we had
ot focussed on. We think that it is likely that the sheep were using information from both the novel
aces as well as the familiar faces. That is, they were choosing pictures they recognised, but could also
ave been following a rule 'if they don't recognised the face, then the other choice is more likely to be
orrect'. Importantly, of course, this strategy still requires the sheep to know that the novel face is
unfamiliar'.
n response to the reviewer comment, we have revised our discussion to take into account the fact that
he sheep could have been using novelty as a cue (p. 15-16, lines334-345) We have also included
nother video that supports this possibility. The video shows the very first time one of the sheep saw a
hotograph of her handler. Although it is qualitative it is very relevant, since the sheep appears to be
sing use the information of the unfamiliar face to make her decision. (i.e. she is following the rule 'I
on't recognised this photograph, therefore the other one will be familiar'.) She looks first at the
nfamiliar face, and moves towards the other face. When the alternative photograph also turns out to be
ovel, the sheep checks the first (unfamiliar) face again, compares it to the novel photograph of the
amiliar person, and then makes her decision to choose the familiar person. We did not originally include
his video in the submission because it was not of particularly good quality and it was conducted in our
ld system. It does, however, illustrate that the sheep are likely to be using information from the
nfamiliar as well as the familiar face. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.
More importantly, the authors also fail to address that the performance in the tests (new perspectives
f learned familiar images and handler image) could be also explained by rapid learning rather than
ecognition of familiar faces (see below).
E: This is a valid point. We also believe that the sheep are learning rapidly throughout Training 1-3.
he probe-test, however, shows that the sheep are 'recognising' the learned familiar faces in new
erspectives. Here, the explanation of rapid learning is not sufficient, since each tilted face is only
resented once, and still the performance of the sheep is significantly above chance. Rapid learning
ould indeed be an explanation for the high performance in the detection of the very familiar face (the
andler), when the same image was presented three times. However, with a performance of nearly 75%
orrect this means that two sheep made a correct response on all three, and 6 made correct response in
wo out of three cases.
n response to the reviewer's comment, we have added discussion of this point to the manuscript (p.16,
nes 355-363).
econd, there is much room for improvement in terms of the terminology used and the structuring of
he methods and results section. Specifically, the manuscript needs more consistency and clarification in
erms of its terminology. The authors should clarify the distinction between recognition and
ifferentiation (see Tibbets et al 2007, Coulon et al. 2009 vs Coulon et al. 2011). Both terms seem to be
sed interchangeably throughout the introduction and methods (see 1st and 4th paragraph in
ntroduction, as well as last paragraph when outlining procedure and goals of experiment).
E: In terms of the terminology; we have checked our manuscript with regard to the reviewer's
omments. We are consistently using 'recognise' or 'recognition', and never 'differentiation'. We do use
distinguish” but only when we are referring to other researchers’ work.
also found the authors’ use of the word ‘probe trials’ rather confusing – probe trials, to my knowledge,
re either always or never rewarded to avoid learning effects (see your reference 36), and are often
nterspersed between rewarded training trials. This term is used throughout the manuscript, but
ccording to the ESM videos and brief sentences in the methods and the results, subjects have been
ewarded for a correct choice (but not incorrect choices) in these trials.
E: We never use the term “probe trials”, which we agree is unrewarded. Rather, we used 'probe-test'
o refer to the probing of our main research questions (whether or not sheep can recognise learned
amiliar faces in different perspectives and whether they can recognise a very familiar handler on a 2D
hotograph. We agree it is somewhat confusing, but couldn't think of a better term to use.
n response to the reviewers comment, we have changed probe-test to test-probe. Although a little
lumsy, it still conveys the meaning and can't be confused with 'probe trial'. We hope this is agreeable to
he reviewer.
t is, however, not clear from the methods whether only the learned front faces have been rewarded.
id the same apply to the faces in the tilted perspective? If yes, did you find a learning effect in the test
essions (which would be quite likely as subjects appear to have learned rapidly to discriminate two
aces over training).
E: In all of our trials the S+ was rewarded. Regarding a rapid learning effect. The probe-test only
ontained one presentation of each tilted face. Thus each sheep complete 15 trials containing the
ollowing (randomised) images: Emma front, Emma left, Emma right, Fiona front, Fiona left, Fiona right,
ake front, Jake left, Jake right, Obama front, Obama left, Obama right and 3xHandler (the same
erspective). Therefore, rapid learning could potentially only take place for the recognition of the picture
f the handler. As argued above we don’t think that rapid learning is the most convincing explanation for
ur results.

E: Thank you for providing these useful references that we have now included them in the manuscript.
he methods and results sections are not appropriately structured. Most importantly, the methods
ection lacks crucial information on the test design and procedure. Quite a lot of information seems to be
laced in the ESM. Please put the statistics and analysis section into the main manuscript, as well as
hat parameters were recorded and how (choice and reaction time). This is crucial information for the
eader and should not be ‘hidden’ in the ESM. The general methods need to provide more detailed
nformation, e.g., it is not clear from the start how long each training took and whether all subjects
eceived all four potential rewarded images, how much unfamiliar images (S(-)) have been used, why
his particular (and very liberal) learning criterium was chosen -> see detailed comments. A lot of this is
ater reported in the results section. The results section itself seems to be mingled with a lot of text that
hould belong into the methods and the discussion section. Please only state plain results in this section
nd keep it concise.
E: We apologised for any confusion about the manuscript organisation that this has caused. The paper
as submitted first to Proc Roy Soc B, and was not reviewed. We were then invited to move the
ubmission to Open Science, which we did. Proc Roy Soc B has the methods as supplementary material,
nd in the original submission (transferred directly over) we felt that without some methodological
xplanation the data would be very hard for a reader to follow.
n response to this and the other reviewer's comments, we have now moved all of the experimental
etails into the main body of the paper. We have restructured the Methods to included subsections on
nimals, Paradigm, Operating system, Programming, Statistics, and Stimuli (p 5-9). We have clarified
he results section and moved methodological information out of the results into the appropriate
methods sections. We hope we have now removed any unnecessary repetition.
etailed comments
There is no line numbering, which makes it a bit hard to specify detailed comments. Please include
hese in a revised version
E: In response to this comment, we have now included line numbers.
Please rename the file name of the supplementary methods to the corresponding journal
E: We have now included all methodology from the supplement material in the main body of the text.
I would recommend adding ‘in 2D images’ or similar wording to the title to represent what has been
one in a more appropriate way
E: Thank you for the suggestion. The title now reads: “Sheep recognise familiar and unfamiliar human
aces from 2D images”
bstract
‘has been only shown in humans’ – but you discuss the findings of reference 36 on capuchin monkeys
ater one which used a similar setup
E: Thank you for this comment. It is true that Pokorny et al use pictures of familiar and unfamiliar
apuchin monkeys. However, their aim was not to train the monkeys to recognise reoccurring unfamiliar
monkeys, which is what we are tested. They rather asked whether the monkeys could detect the “odd
icture” – either the one familiar face in a group of three unfamiliar faces, or the one unfamiliar face in a
roup of three familiar faces. However, the unfamiliar faces were not repeated, so this study does not
how whether the monkeys would recognise the unfamiliar face when shown a second time, which is the
kill that we are investigating. We have rewritten this section, to clarify this difference (p.13-14,
nes288-303).
‘with whom they were familiar from photographs’ – ambiguous writing, not clear if sheep were familiar
ith the handler because they know him from photographs
E: Thank you. The text now reads: “whether sheep could recognise a very familiar handler from
hotographs.” (p.2, line 41)
“identified the handler”
E: Thank you, we changed this accordingly.
ntroduction
Line 1: “young humans” sounds odd. Please specify.
E: We now say “humans” instead.
Line 2: the authors in reference 2 did not test ‘young humans’ (except you refer to college students?).
eference 3 focuses more on social communication.
E: Thank you, for pointing this out. That is correct, which is why we are referring to “humans” in
eneral.
2nd paragraph: delete second bracket behind “sheep (25)”
E: We have deleted the bracket.
The end of the 4th paragraph should also highlight the results of Pierce et al 2001 (cited in the 1st
aragraph) to provide a more complete picture
E: Thank you for this comment. The fourth paragraph actually discusses the study be Pierce in detail. It
ays: “For example, in an interesting face discrimination study by Kendrick and colleagues [11], sheep
ere trained to discriminate between pairs of photographs of familiar or unfamiliar human faces. Sheep
ook fewer trials to learn to discriminate between familiar faces than they needed for the unfamiliar
aces (27.8 ±5.7 and 74.6 ± 13.7 trials (±SEM) respectively). From this study, however, it is impossible
o conclude that the sheep were actually 'recognising' the individuals.” However, as we are referring to
Kendrick and colleagues” we see why this might be confusing. Although the work came from Kendrick's
aboratory, in response to this comment, we have now changed this to Pierce et al. (p.4, line 81).
4th paragraph, last line : it is not clear why this reference is used here. In my opinion, a reference
bout the difference between differentiation vs recognition or a review on face recognition would be
more appropriate.
E: Thank you. We have now specified what we were referring to, which is that the sheep could have
imply done a two-choice discrimination as show in other behavioural tasks, such as a two-choice
iscrimination task using abstract 2D images [37] (p.4, line 88).
Last paragraph, Lines3: ‘to learn to recognize’? Wasn’t training supposed to test whether they
ifferentiate between images, while probe trials to test for whether they recognize the learned familiar
aces in a different perspective?
E: Thank you for this question. Yes, that was the ultimate question, but in order to answer this we first
ested their ability to learn to recognise four individuals that they had never seen before from
epeatedly-shown photographs. This tested whether sheep could recognise that an unfamiliar face was
epeatedly shown. Only then we asked if sheep could recognise those faces when they were presented in
new perspective (tilted to the left or to the right).
n response to this comment, we have revised this sentence (p.4-5, lines91-92).l
ethods
Could you provide a little bit more information on the subjects’ history and test background? Have they
een successful (i.e. good learners) in previous discrimination tasks? Are these eight subjects the only
nimals in the flock or are they kept with other subjects (probably non-learners in previous tasks)? What
as their feeding regime? At what time of day have they been exposed to the tests? Have testing times
een randomized over individuals and days? What was the reward for correct choices?
E: Thank you for this question. In response to this comment, we have now added details about the
ast history of the sheep. (p.5, lines102-107; p.5, l09-111).
If subjects reached the criterion, were they directly transferred to the next Training phase or did they
articipate in the full four sessions?
E: Thanks. Every sheep participated in full four sessions. By the end of four sessions all sheep had
eached the learning criterion. In response to this comment we have clarified this in the text (p.6, lines
32-133).
It would be great to see an additional Figure depicturing the test apparatus and system
E: Thank you for this comment. We have included a figure showing the operant system (Figure 1). We
ave changed the numbering of the figures accordingly. The system is well described in McBride et al.,
011, which is the identical system that we use. Furthermore, it is depicted in Knolle, et al. 2017, which
lso uses the same animals. Additionally, there is a video (ESM Video 4 showing how a sheep circulates
n the operating system).
2nd paragraphs, line 3: not clear whether this applies to a week, a Training set, or the total
xperiment. Supplements say that sheep received 12-16 trials, but here you state it was always 12
rials. Please clarify.
E: We apologise for any confusion: it should say 12-15, as the test-probe contains 15 trials (3 of the
andler) + (3(angles) x 4(faces)). We have now modified this to clarify. “Sheep were tested in one
ession of 12 trials (training) per day for 4 days or 15 trials (probe-test) on one day.” (p. 6, line 132-
33)
2nd paragraphs, line 5: more ‘taught to differentiate between four unfamiliar faces from different
nfamiliar faces’?
E: In response to the comment, the text now reads: “During the training stages, the sheep were
aught to discriminate repeatedly-presented photographs of four unfamiliar people (learned-familiar
aces) from unrepeated unfamiliar people.” (p. 6-7, lines 135-137)
3rd paragraph, line 4: how did you choose four sessions maximum for each training? Although all the
heep reached criterion in the given time, the amount of total trials (48) seems rather low compared to
ther experiments in discrimination learning experiments in ungulates.
E: Thank you for the comment. Initially, 4 sessions were our minimum for a sheep to stay on one
raining stage. However, all sheep reached the criterion of 75% correct over 20 trials or 6 correct trials
n a row within this time. On Training 1 and 2, 6 out of 8 sheep had received 6 correct trials in a row.
hose sheep are well trained in the operant system, which we believe is the main reason for the small
umbers of trials, as those sheep don’t need to be habituated to the testing apparatus (p.8, lines 162-
66).
3rd paragraph, line 4: so each sheep received all potential S(+) images? It is implied in this sentence
ere, but this wasn’t clear before.
E: Sorry for any confusion. Yes, all sheep were trained on all four faces. In response to this comment
e now say that each sheep is trained on all four faces on p. 2, lines 32-34. and p. 4-5, lines 91-92, p.7,
nes 43-44.
End of page 5: how many S(-) images were available? How likely was it that subjects have seen the
ame stimulus twice or more? I am wondering whether sheep might have learned to avoid novel stimuli
ather than simply approaching rewarded ones.
E: Thanks for the comment. S- images (unfamiliar, unrepeated faces) were drawn from a pool of 36
aces, so the sheep would have seen the same unfamiliar faces again after three days, however in a new
rder and against a different learned familiar face. For the correction trials, these images were drawn
rom a second pool of 30 images, which were never repeated.
n response to this comment, we have now added these details to the methodology (p.7, lines 149-
51).
End of 3rd paragraph: 14 correction trials when administering 12 trials per session in total? This is
uite a lot.
E: Thank you for this question, on average, sheep had 2.7 correction trials per session. However,
uring the first session on training stage 1 and 2, one sheep required 14 correction trials. In response to
his comment, we have now specified this in the text (p.8, lines 162-163).
End of 3rd paragraph: ‘70% correct in 20 trials’: Please also state the exact trial number here (14). 14
ut of 20 trials correct does not provide a p value below 0.05. How did you come up with this criterion?
oes it also imply that performance across up to 3 sessions was accounted? See also the discrepancy
rom what is provided in Figure 1.
E: Thank you for pointing this out, it is a typographical error. It should have been 75% correct in 20
rials, which gives a binomial probability of 0.015 and a cumulative probability with P(X>x) of 0.006. We
ounted in correction trials to compute the learning rate across sessions. This has been corrected.
I would find it interesting to see whether subjects differed in their reaction time depending on whether
hey have made a correct or incorrect choice (see Proops et al. 2010 and Nawroth et al. 2013).
E: That is a very interesting question and we asked the same. However, this is statistically difficult, as
e are having too few data for the incorrect trials for each sheep, face and session. In order to explore
his question a bit more we generated reaction time values across all faces, one for incorrect and one for
orrect responses, one for the first training session and one for the last. In an 2x2 ANOVA
outcome(corr., incorr.) * time(first, last session)) we did not find any significant main effects or
nteractions. In a Bonferroni corrected post-hoc test, however, we found that in the first session,
esponse times to incorrect trials were significantly slower than to correct trials (t=2.7, df=7, p=0.05),
hich is consistent with the literature (ref. 40 Proops et al., 2010; ref 41 Nawroth et al, 2013). In
esponse to this comment, we have now included these findings in results section of the manuscript
p.10-11, lines 223-230).
In terms of the probe trials with the image of their handler, I could not find information on why this
articular handler was chosen and how the daily (positive) interactions between this handler and the
heep looked like.
E: Thank you for this question. The handler trained the sheep daily. She would work with them for at
east two hours a day. Sheep followed the handler voluntarily, fed from her, and stayed calm during
ealth inspections. She was one of the two principle handlers. In response to this comment, we have
ow added this to the manuscript. (p.12, lines 258-262)

esults
There is an inconsistency in capitalizing ‘Training’ throughout the ms.
E: Thank you for pointing this out. Training is now only capitalized when we are referring to one
pecific training stage (Training 1-3).
How are SEM of 0.02-0.1% possible throughout Training 1-3, but for probe trials they increased to up
o 7.5%. What was happening here?
E: Thank you very much for pointing out this inconsistency. We missed to transfer the decimals in to
ercentiles. We corrected this for all three training stages: Training 1: from 59.0±7.9% in the first to
9.7±4.8%; Training 2: improved from 56.6±4.8% in the first to 87.5±4.8%; from 71.5±1.7% in the
irst to 79.3±2.7%. The variance is now consistent with what is reported for the final probe test.
Please avoid using ‘in hindsight’
E: We have deleted this sentence.
Last paragraph, last sentence: times in comparison to the probe trials with the images in a tilted
erspective or with the interspersed trials with the front celebrity faces?
E: Thank you. For clarity, we have rewritten this sentence: (p.12, lines 264-266)
iscussion
I miss a more critical discussion on potential factors that might alternatively account for the
erformance of your sheep, such as avoidance of novelty or rapid learning in the test trials.
E: Thank you for this suggestion. In response to this comment, we have now extended the discussion
nd added four paragraphs discussing the data and providing alternative explanations (p.14-16, lines
04-363).
1st paragraph, line 4: “only in dimensions from a photograph” sounds odd. Please rephrase.
E: In response to this comment, we have rewritten this to read 'Finally, the inclusion of the handlers
aces within the test-probe shows that sheep can identify from a 2D image the face of a very familiar
erson (handler)'. (p.13, lines 278-280)
1st paragraph, lines 4-5: I know what you are trying to say here - but you only tested unfamiliar, not
amiliar, faces during Training 3, right? I think this sentence should be rephrased in order to better
epresent a summary of your findings.
E: Thanks for this comment. The training of our paradigm shows that sheep can be trained to
ecognise unfamiliar faces. The probe-test shows, first, that sheep can identify these particular
nfamiliar faces in new perspectives, and, second, that they can recognise a familiar person from daily
nteractions on a 2D picture.
n response to the comment, we have clarified this as follows: “Our training data show that sheep can
earn to recognise the faces of unfamiliar individuals from photographs. The test-probe shows that sheep
an recognise those individuals even when the image is presented in different perspectives. Finally, the
nclusion of the handler's faces within the test-probe shows that sheep can identify from a 2D image the
ace of a very familiar person (handler). Thus sheep identified both familiar and unfamiliar human faces
n a cross-species paradigm with relatively little training (a maximum of 48 trials).” (p.13, lines 276-
81)
1st paragraph, last sentence: what do you mean by advanced? Advanced compared to what? Please do
rovide some references here.
E: Our results show that sheep possess holistic face-recognition skills. In response to this comment we
ave changed the last sentence accordingly (p.13, line 283).
2nd paragraph, first line : switch ref to (30,31); what is the question mark for? You start the sentence
ith same-species paradigms, but refer in brackets to the learning of human images – please rephrase
ppropriately.
E: Our apologies. The question mark was a typographical error, and has now been removed. We also
orrected the test, it now says: “Previous work using same-species paradigm [34,35] showed that sheep
se information from specific forms of familiarity that were mainly social familiarity (measured as the
bility to distinguish between photographs of sheep from the same breed and a different breed).” (p.13,
nes 284-287)
3rd paragraph: It would be great to see a brief discussion on the potential effects that sheep
omestication might have had
E: Thank you for this suggestion. We already discussed this aspect briefly in this paragraph. We have
ow further extended this paragraph: 'The group of sheep we used here has daily interaction with
umans, both during behavioural testing and routine husbandry. This enhanced exposure to human
aces could partially explain the excellent performance of the sheep in this task. The extensive human
ontact is potentially making them human-face experts. One could also argue that the general
omestication of sheep contributes to their abilities to recognise humans. However, the breed of our
heep, Welsh Mountain, is characterized by their ability to survive independently of human support in
he harsh environments in mountain areas. Therefore, it would be interesting to test this paradigm in a
roup of sheep that has had comparatively little exposure to human faces' (p.17, lines 366-375).
Last paragraph, line 6: ‘are unable to recognize…’
E: Thanks. We have changed this accordingly.
I would be great to see a concluding paragraph, summarizing the results and stating their importance
or future research in small ruminants (welfare, human-animal interactions, translational research, etc)
E: Thank you for the suggestion. We have now added a Conclusion (p.18, lines 391-403).
eferences
There are frequent formatting errors in the references. E.g., URLs should be deleted.
E: We apologise for the errors. In response to this comment, we have now removed all the URLs and
ouble checked the references.
igures and Tables
Figure 1 states a learning criterion of 75%. This is different from the two criterion that are stated in
he methods part. Please explain. Please also state the number of absolute trials for 70 or 75% of
orrect choices.
E: As explained above 70% correct was a typo. It is supposed to be 75% correct in 20 trials (15 out of
0), which gives a binomial probability of 0.015 and a cumulative probability with P(X>x) of 0.006. We
ounted in correction trials to compute the learning rate across sessions.
Figure 3: “Photographs shown…”, delete ‘-‘ in ‘probe-test’.
E: Thanks for spotting this, it has been corrected.

SOS-171228. Sheep recognise familiar and unfamiliar human faces.
verall, I found the topic of this manuscript really interesting and looked forward to reading it. The
tandard of writing is generally high, but I also have some suggestions for edits (see below). The
nclusion of the supplement video files really helped my understanding of the Methods and Results. I am
uessing that the manuscript was originally written for Proceedings B and that is why there is
nformation on Methods in the Supplement Materials. These should be moved into the main manuscript
or RSOS, to improve clarity.
here are many formatting and other errors throughout the Reference list – too many to detail here. The
uthors should be more careful before submitting a manuscript like this.
E: We apologise for the errors, we have now removed all the URLs and double-checked the references.

E: Thank you for this comment. The first time we discuss transgenic sheep is in the last part of the
iscussion to point out that this paradigm and the results are potentially very relevant to study the
ognitive decline in the sheep and eventually the efficacy of treatments. In response to this comment we
aver rephrased this to make it clear that no HD sheep were used in this study ( p.17-18, lines 383-

E: The first paragraph is only a summary of our findings, which is why we could not include any

E: The use of parenthetical dash is correct English, and is a useful device for emphasis. Its use is not
estricted to informal e-mails. It has been used by a diverse range of authors including Henry James and
notably - Emily Dickinson. Nevertheless, in response to this comment, we have deleted it and created
wo sentences. (“This enhanced exposure to human faces could partially explain the excellent
erformance of the sheep in this task. The extensive human contact is potentially making them human-
ace experts” (p.17, lines 368-370).
