Comments:
Overall, the manuscript provides the discovery and characterization of three glycosyltransferases
from Andrographis paniculata involved in the biosynthesis of the plant flavonoids. These
candidate UFGTs were cloned, heterologously expressed, and purified from E. coli. It is clear that
the authors discovered three glycosyltransferases with broad substrate specificities. The data that
the authors present, is highly novel, particularly the identification and characterization of the
flavonoids glycosyltransferases from Andrographis paniculata. These enzymes can be used for
modifying flavonoid-like compounds to improve the biological activity, and can be potentially
used in synthetic biology. The strength of this manuscript is its novelty and the extensive
substrate specificity studies. Overall, this is nice work on a challenging system. However, there
are grammatical and spelling errors in the manuscript. The manuscript will need to be clarified
prior to publication. The errors did not prevent the material from being understood, but without
correction, it would just be sloppy presentation. Once addressed, I think the manuscript is
suitable for publication.
For example, the summary “and performed multi-site glycosidation towards the substrate
molecules. Especially, they can preferentially act on the 7-OH position of the A ring” should
revise to “the enzymes identified exhibit multi-site glycosidation towards the substrate
molecules. Specifically, they can preferentially act on the 7-OH position of the A ring. ”;
Line 34 of page 2 change to “7-OH group of flavonoids as well as catalysing the glycosylation of
flavones”;
Line 18 of page 4, “and they all” change to “both of which”;
Line 37 of page 4, change to “multiple types of hydroxyl groups”, also line 38 of page 4, change to
“For certain flavonoids”.
As for the conclusions, I would write something like “We identified and isolated three novel
substrate-promiscuous glycosyltransferases from Andrographis paniculata (ApUFGTs), all of
which could glycosylate flavonoids with various structures and preferentially glycosylate 7-OH
of the A ring. These enzymes also exhibited multiple functions involving the glycosylation of
different hydroxyl groups on flavonoids” and “hold considerable promise for further resource
development”.
Also, latin names should be in italics in the whole manuscript.
Further minor points on Figure 4: Use“*” or other symbols to represent the glucosylated products
which were determined to be 7-O-glucosides compared with the standard.

In this manuscript, the authors report three novel flavonoid glycosyltransferases from the leaves
of Andrographis paniculata. Substrate spectrum investigation demonstrated that the three
glycosyltransferases exhibited substrate promiscuity with other type compounds as substrates
except for flavonoids. These results are very interesting, and the manuscript is recommended to
be accepted after minor revision.
Suggestion:
The biochemical properties of these new glycosyltransferases should be investigated.

Dear Dr li,
The editors assigned to your paper ("Functional characterization of three novel flavonoid
glycosyltransferases from Andrographis paniculata") have now received comments from
reviewers. We would like you to revise your paper in accordance with the referee and Associate
Editor suggestions which can be found below (not including confidential reports to the Editor).
Please note this decision does not guarantee eventual acceptance.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper before 26-Apr-2019. Please note that the revision
deadline will expire at 00.00am on this date. If we do not hear from you within this time then it
will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In exceptional circumstances, extensions
may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in advance. We do not allow multiple rounds
of revision so we urge you to make every effort to fully address all of the comments at this stage.
If deemed necessary by the Editors, your manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the
original reviewers for assessment. If the original reviewers are not available, we may invite new

Responses to the comments of Reviewer 1
Comments:
1.For example, the summary “and performed multi-site glycosidation towards the
substrate molecules. Especially, they can preferentially act on the 7-OH position of
the A ring” should revise to “the enzymes identified exhibit multi-site glycosidation
towards the substrate molecules. Specifically, they can preferentially act on the 7-OH
position of the A ring. ”;
Line 34 of page 2 change to “7-OH group of flavonoids as well as catalysing the
glycosylation of flavones”;
Line 18 of page 4, “and they all” change to “both of which”;
Line 37 of page 4, change to “multiple types of hydroxyl groups”, also line 38 of page
4, change to “For certain flavonoids”.
As for the conclusions, I would write something like “We identified and isolated three
novel substrate-promiscuous glycosyltransferases from Andrographis paniculata
(ApUFGTs), all of which could glycosylate flavonoids with various structures and
preferentially glycosylate 7-OH of the A ring. These enzymes also exhibited multiple
functions involving the glycosylation of different hydroxyl groups on flavonoids” and
“hold considerable promise for further resource development”.
Response 1: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s notice. We have corrected the mentioned
errors, including the summary, line 34 of page 2, line 18 of page 4, line 37 of page 4,
line 38 of page 4 and the conclusions. Additionally, we have polished the manuscript
thoroughly.
2. Also, latin names should be in italics in the whole manuscript.
Response 2: Thank you for your helpful advice. We have italicized all the latin names
in the whole manuscript.
3. Further minor points on Figure 4: Use“*” or other symbols to represent the
glucosylated products which were determined to be 7-O-glucosides compared with
the standard.
Response 3: Thank you for catching this oversight. In the revised manuscript, we
have used“*” to represent the glucosylated products which were determined to be
7-O-glucosides compared with the standard in Figure 4.
Responses to the comments of Reviewer 2
The biochemical properties of these new glycosyltransferases should be investigated.
Response 3:
Thank you very much for your helpful advice. As suggested, we have investigated the
biochemical properties of these glycosyltransferases. The results showed that the three
ApUFGTs all exhibited the highest enzymatic activity at 40°C, and the optimum pH
values for ApUFGTs were all approximately 8.0.
Responses to the comments of Reviewer 3
1, Enzyme Assays
“m/z” should be italic.
2, cDNA cloning of ApUFGTs
“Olea europaea” should be italic.
“O” in “3-O-glucosyltransferase” should be italic, the same below.
Response 1: We thank the reviewer for this astute observation. We have italicized the
“m/z”,“Olea europaea” and“O” in the whole manuscript.
3, More attention should be paid to a clear descriptive legend, and this should be
revised for all figures including supporting figures.
Response 2: Thank you for this helpful suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we
have described all figures more clearly, including supporting figures.
4, Where should Figure S1 be inserted in the text?
Response 3: Thank you for catching this oversight. We inserted Figure S1 in the text
of “UPLC-Q/TOF-MS Confirmation of Glycosylation Products”.
5, Check the structures, substitution positions and stereochemistry of all substrates.
Also, flavonoids should be numbered.
Response 4: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which we have incorporated
into the revised manuscript.
6, Conclusion
“Novel” should be deleted.
Response 5: We thank the reviewer for this correction, we have deleted the“Novel” in
the manuscript .
7, A linguistic editing is required for correct grammar throughout the article.
Response 6: Thank you for the kind suggestion. We have extensively revised the
manuscript, and carefully proofread the text in an attempt to catch all typographical
errors and grammar. We also used the editing service to enable the manuscript to
make a better impression on the readers.
8, Where are Tables S1 and S2? Authors may have miswritten Tables S1 and S2 into
Tables 1 and 2.
Response 7: Thank you for your helpful advice. We have corrected these mistakes.
