Burgess et al. use stable isotope analysis (SIA) to assess the diet of giant mantas M. birostris off
Ecuador. This is an ideal scenario to use SIA for diet analysis, given the rarity of samples for
traditional stomach content analyses, the conservation interests for this species, and lack of basic
biological information for this species.
Due to the above, this manuscript provides information for diet of M. birostris that is valuable.
However, it is this reviewer’s opinion that several aspects of the SIA data analyses must be
improved, or at least addressed in the manuscript, in order for this paper to be published. These
concerns are outlined below.
Diet data for mixing models
The analyses in this paper are primarily used to estimate the relative proportion of epipelagic
versus mesopelagic diet sources in manta ray diet; however, the proxy for mesopelagic diet
sources is mesopelagic fish off Costa Rica from Choy et al. (2015). As filter feeders that are
thought to primarily feed on plankton, this is a serious shortcoming. The authors address this in
the Discussion by noting that other filter feeders consume fish as well as plankton; however, the
feeding mechanisms of baleen whales, for example, differ markedly from those of giant mantas.
Even if feeding on fishes along with zooplankton indeed occurs in giant mantas, it is
inappropriate to represent mesopelagic diet sources of a filter feeder with fish only. Since
mesopelagic fish are themselves zooplanktivorous, their d13C and d15N can be expected to differ
by one full trophic level (1 DTDF) from zooplankton.
This could be addressed by a more thorough search of the literature to obtain representative
mesopelagic zooplankton samples; a brief search by this reviewer yielded possible data sources,
from publications by Hannides, Choy, Popp, and others, that report meso-zooplankton data in
the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Alternatively, using DTDF estimates for small fish, the
authors could estimate the d13C and d15N values for mesozooplankton in the NPSG from the
mesopelagic fish values in Choy et al.
DTDF selection
Manuscript reports DTDF values used and reference, but do not cite the species this DTDF came
from nor do they justify the use of this DTDF. Since no existing DTDFs exist for giant mantas, it
would likely be useful to select at least 2 of the most appropriate DTDFs in the literature, apply
them to mixing models, and assess the extent to which DTDF choice may affect results.
Potential effects of regional migration and temporal variability
The variability of manta d13C and d15N values could be caused at least in part by differences in
migratory patterns. This is mentioned in the Discussion but this could be explored in more detail.
Isoscapes for this region are available in Graham et al (2010) Isoscapes and Lorrain et al (2014)
Deep Sea Research II, and show appreciable variability in the region of study. Could these
isoscapes be combined with known extent of manta movements to make conjectures of where
mantas may be migrating from?
3
Zooplankton also shows considerable range of d13C and d15N values (Supplementary Material),
and this, along with potential inter-individual and inter-annual effects on manta d13C and d15N
values, could be discussed in further detail.
Tagging data
There is no discussion of electronic tagging data that suggest mesopelagic feeding in reef mantas
(Braun et al 2014) and in giant mantas (Stewart et al. 2016). This electronic tagging bears mention
as it directly supports this study’s assertion of mesopelagic resources in diet of giant mantas.

The authors use stable isotopes to assess the feeding ecology of manta rays off Ecuador. The
authors raise an interesting idea; these macro filter feeders are not feeding on surface water but
mostly foraging on deeper mesopelagic prey. This may certainly be possible and there are some
interesting results: however, I find it very hard to draw any conclusions without some idea of
movements of these animals. A key issue with the data is that they don’t collect the mesopelagic
zooplankton from the same area as their study, with isotopic values of plankton being quite
variable. Based on this manuscript, there is no data on residency times, scale of movements and
most importantly, dive behavior for this species. I also felt that the authors left out several key
papers, including (strikingly) one on stable isotopes and movements for this species in the eastern
Pacific!
Pg 5.
What was the accuracy of the measurements for this specific data? Accuracy estimates are
generally included with the results
The authors use arithmetic correction to account for lipids in zooplankton. While this is a well-
known method, there are also criticisms for its use. It would be really useful to see how mixing
model results varied assuming a) no lipid correction, or b) some estimate of zooplankton isotopes
after actual lipid removal. At the moment the authors are putting a lot of faith in one equation
4
(where does this come from?) and don’t acknowledge how this may influence results. It may
have no effect in general mixing model conclusions, but at present its impossible to say. I believe
this is critical, especially as the presented results are quite surprising. See for example, results of
Papastamatiou et al. 2015. MEPS. 521:155-170 where the different model outputs are compared
based on lipid extraction and different DTDF’s.
For the equation calculating trophic position, what does the 3 account for?
Pg 6.
Same here with the DTDF value. One was selected from the literature but it wasn’t explained
why this value was used, or investigated as to how the different factors may have changed the
results.
Much more details are needed on the mesopelagic zooplankton samples and other fishes and
turtles, used in the analyses. At the moment nothing is given. Were samples lipid extracted?
How were the C:N ratios different? What DTDF values were used? It’s very difficult to have
confidence in cross-species comparisons without this information, and this variability would not
be included in the Bayesian model.
Results:
The authors use a lot of ANOVA’s which increases the chance of type 2 errors. It would seem
like GLMs could be constructed to simultaneously account for sex, year etc
Discussions:
I felt the authors left out some key references, especially Stewart et al. 2016 Biological
Conservation 200:178-183 which describes the movements and feeding ecology of M. birostris
from several sites including the eastern Pacific.
There are also studies of both movements and foraging ecology for M. alfredi. The authors
compare their results to data from Australia, but there are other closer sites that combined
telemetry with stable isotopes (e.g. McCauley et al. 2014. Marine Biology 161:1987-1998).
Pg 9. The feeding ecology, and even mechanics of whale sharks are very different from mantas.
Have there been any observations of mantas foraging on schooling fish?
M. alfredi are also found at oceanic islands
Pg 10, line 3-5 is very speculative with little evidence to support this idea
Pg 10, line 29-32. I think this point should be made clearer. Although the manta population
appears to be generalist, that may be an artefact of it being made of individual specialists. That
may be what the authors mean, but I am not sure. This could be a valid (although not confirmed)
point.
I overall had a problem with the comparison to other studies. In addition to data being taken
from other studies, without many details being given, the study makes no mention of the
movements of these species (other than a brief mention of large scale movements by turtles).
How far do the thresher sharks and tunas move or dive, to make these comparisons worthwhile?
If they are not residents and simply transients, then is the comparison valid? There are tracking
studies for both these species (although I don’t know if they are in the same area).
Overall there is certainly some useful information here, but at the moment I see several holes
(some of which could be filled) which make it difficult for me to be convinced that the mantas are
getting 90% of their diet from mesopelagic prey.

label_comment_4
I thank the authors for addressing the reviewer’s comments. I was certainly more convinced after
reading the revision, that mantas are getting a significant component of their diet from
mesopelagic sources. I still have some concerns.
My primary concern is still the fact that the mesopelagic source isotopes were taken a long way
from the study site. I completely understand that the authors did not have the power to sample at
their site….that doesn’t remove the issue however. Especially, as there is some recent evidence
suggesting more residential behavior at east pacific islands. I don’t see a way around this other
than perhaps making very clear in the discussion the potentially serious issue of assuming the
mesopelagic isotope source are representative of the study site.
I think the addition of some satellite telemetry would really strengthen the paper. When I read
one of the authors had data showing mantas diving deep, I was a lot more confident in their
conclusions. I assume they are preparing a separate paper, but even one diving plot would be
useful.
I do have a concern with their trophic position estimates. They are using surface zooplankton as
baseline but the mixing model suggests surface zooplankton is a minor component of the diet. Is
it a valid measure of ‘baseline’ when calculating trophic position?
I see no problem with comparing isoscapes with those from other predators in the area. However,
the authors state that the tunas and thresher sharks are transient. Presumably therefore, the
isotopic signature of their muscle is not representative of the study site as the turnover times are
going to be several months or longer?
Line 293. This statement is true for all animals!
Line 315 I am confused by this sentence. It implies (as written) that mantas also eat humbolt and
flying squid
Fig. 1. For the comparison of m.alfredi why do the authors use an estimate from Australia? There
is data from the central Pacific (McCauley et al. 2015. Mar. Biol.) which is much closer
geographically that a study site in Australia.

I thank the authors for responding to the second round of fairly extensive comments. They have
answered most of my concerns. I believe the movements of the mantas is key and I look forward
to their paper on movements. Personally, I was not convinced by the Stewart et al paper, as
mantas were only satellite tagged for short time periods (a few months) and some of those
locations have diving operations who report only seasonal presence of mantas. I am therefore not
that surprised that the authors own data (without having seen it) contradicts the Stewart et al
paper. I will say that the ‘residential or transient’ classification of the species by IUCN is
irrelevant to the present paper. The true behavioral pattern is really only of importance to the
interpretation of the results, not the legalities of how they are classified by IUCN.

Comments to the Author(s)
I thank the authors for responding to the second round of fairly extensive comments. They have
answered most of my concerns. I believe the movements of the mantas is key and I look forward
to their paper on movements. Personally, I was not convinced by the Stewart et al paper, as
mantas were only satellite tagged for short time periods (a few months) and some of those
locations have diving operations who report only seasonal presence of mantas. I am therefore not
that surprised that the authors own data (without having seen it) contradicts the Stewart et al
paper. I will say that the ‘residential or transient’ classification of the species by IUCN is
irrelevant to the present paper. The true behavioral pattern is really only of importance to the
interpretation of the results, not the legalities of how they are classified by IUCN.
Appendix A
We would like to extend our gratitude to the two anonymous Reviewers who provided
incredibly helpful comments.
Reply to reviewers comments (reviewers comments highlighted)
Even if feeding on fishes along with zooplankton indeed occurs in giant mantas, it is
inappropriate to represent mesopelagic diet sources of a filter feeder with fish only. Since
mesopelagic fish are themselves zooplanktivorous, their d13C and d15N can be expected to
differ by one full trophic level (1 DTDF) from zooplankton. This could be addressed by a
more thorough search of the literature to obtain representative mesopelagic zooplankton
samples; a brief search by this reviewer yielded possible data sources, from publications by
Hannides, Choy, Popp, and others, that report meso-zooplankton data in the North Pacific
Subtropical Gyre.
Accepted. Changed. We have now used:
(p. 3, lines 72-75) “Dietary information for Manta species is based mostly on
observational data, primarily gained from near-surface feeding events during daylight.
Zooplankton collected by plankton tows at the time of these events has been assumed to
represent the species’ diet.”
(p. 6, lines 158-164) “sources for all mixing models were constrained to surface
zooplankton from Isla de la Plata and assumed representative of mesopelagic sources from
other studies. There is strong isotopic coupling between mesopelagic zooplankton and
mesopelagic fishes (Valls et al., 2014), therefore, small mesopelagic fish (Cyclothone alba
(n=3), Cyema atrum (n=3) and Hygophum proximum (n=5)) from the North Pacific
Subtropical Gyre with equivalent trophic positions to primary and secondary copepod
consumers (2.1 – 2.9 (Hannides et al., 2009)) were used as a representative mesopelagic food
source.”
Also accepted that these other studies present mesopelagic zooplankton samples.
Hannides et al. (2009) presents bulk d15N data alongside amino acid specific stable isotope
results but unfortunately no bulk d13C information needed for the mixing model conducted
here. Similar to the Hannides publication, Popp et al. (2007) presents bulk nitrogen and
amino acid specific SIA results. In the methodology for this paper they do state samples
underwent bulk stable isotope analysis for both carbon and nitrogen but carbon values are
only given for tuna with carbon values for the mesopelagic zooplankton not appearing in
either the publication or the supplementary material. Olson et al. (2010) presents bulk stable
isotope data for zooplankton but these are from surface tows akin to what was done in this
study.
Surface zooplankton from Ecuador was used as an isotopic baseline as it was deemed
appropriate in relation to our question of interest: were visually observed M. birostris feeding
events in surface waters at this aggregation site a significant contributor to overall dietary
intake? Mesopelagic values exist for zooplankton in other worldwide locations, but the
sampling location of this study (Eastern equatorial Pacific) is uniquely characterised by high
levels of both coastal and equatorial upwelling. For representative mesopelagic sources,
values from Choy et al. 2015 were deemed more appropriate than mesopelagic zooplankton
values from other oceanic regions as the trophic positions of the fish being used as the
baseline were well understood and these fish would have been subject to similar productivity
and upwelling dynamics as the surface zooplankton collected at Isla de la Plata.
What was the accuracy of the measurements for this specific data? Accuracy estimates are
generally included with the results. The authors use arithmetic correction to account for lipids
in zooplankton. While this is a well-known method, there are also criticisms for its use. It
would be really useful to see how mixing model results varied assuming a) no lipid
correction, or b) some estimate of zooplankton isotopes after actual lipid removal.
Agreed and changed. We agree with the reviewer that it is important to use
appropriate diet tissue discrimination factors (DTDFs) given mixing model sensitivity to
these critical values. There are currently no experimentally determined DTDFs for manta rays
and there is still uncertainty regarding the necessity to correct d13C values when C:N ratios
are <3.5. This is a problem faced by all planktivorous elasmobranch stable isotope studies as
there have been limited controlled feeding experiments and methodology protocols published
which has hindered the resolution of these issues. To better account for this uncertainty,
trophic level estimates and mixing models were re-run using both currently available
experimentally determined DTDF values from elasmobranchs. Additionally, lipid normalised
and non-normalised surface zooplankton data were used in separate models to also test for
this effect. Trophic level estimates for both DTDFs and for multiple mixing models are all
now presented in the manuscript. Incorporating this uncertainty in appropriate DTDFs and
lipid normalisation protocol has produced added variability but overall results and ecological
interpretation of the data has remained unchanged. Average trophic level estimates still
support the hypothesis that M. birostris is a secondary consumer and gains the majority of its
diet from mesopelagic sources in this region.
(p. 7, lines 170-180) “separate mixing models were run incorporating experimentally
determined DTDFs from other elasmobranch species: Triakis semifasciata (1.7 ± 0.5 for 13C
and 3.7 ± 0.4 for 15N (Kim et al., 2012)) and large pelagic sharks Carcharias taurus and
Negaprion brevirostris (0.9 ± 0.33 for 13C and 2.29 ± 0.22 for 15N (Hussey et al., 2010)). To
account for the uncertainty in appropriate DTDF values and lipid normalisation of surface
zooplankton d13C four separate mixing models were run. Model 1 source inputs comprised of
mesopelagic fishes and lipid normalised surface zooplankton d13C values along with DTDFs
from large sharks (Hussey et al., 2010). Model 2 source inputs were mesopelagic fishes and
non-lipid normalised surface zooplankton d13C with the large shark DTDF. Models 3 and 4
comprised the same source inputs as model 1 and 2 respectively, but used DTDF values from
T. semifasciata (Kim et al., 2012).”
(p. 8, lines 199-200) “The average trophic position estimates for Manta birostris
elasmobranch specific d15N DTDFs of 3.7‰ and 2.3‰ was 3.2 (range 2.3-4.4) and 3.6 (range
2.2-5.6), respectively.”
(p. 8, lines 206-209) “Average enrichment between M. birostris and surface
zooplankton (lipid normalised) sampled off mainland Ecuador was 2.9‰ and 2.8‰ for d13C
and d15N values, respectively (figure 1). When surface zooplankton d13C was not normalised
the enrichment between zooplankton and M. birostris d13C was 3.7‰.”
(p. 8, lines 213-217) “Average credible intervals for these mixing models for surface
zooplankton were 23-31% whereas for mesopelagic sources it was 62-77% (table 2). All
mixing models found mesopelagic sources to generate a majority contribution in comparison
to surface zooplankton to the diet of M. birostris (figure 3).”
At the moment the authors are putting a lot of faith in one equation (where does this come
from?)
Accepted. Changed. The sentence has been reworded so it is now explicit. (p. 4, lines
130-131) “thus d13C values were normalised using an arithmetic correction for zooplankton
lipids”
Isoscapes for this region are available in Graham et al (2010) Isoscapes and Lorrain et al
(2014) Deep Sea Research II, and show appreciable variability in the region of study. Could
these isoscapes be combined with known extent of manta movements to make conjectures of
where mantas may be migrating from?
This is a really interesting avenue of research highlighted by the reviewer and is
something that we would like to pursue in the future. Higher POM d13C values are found in
equatorial regions of both the California and Peru upwelling systems in comparison to higher
latitudes in these same systems. Cross comparing isoscapes with M. birostris isotopic
compositions and movement data from satellite tracks would certainly be interesting but at
present, the low resolution information that bulk stable isotope currently provides due to the
lack of isotopic differentiation between the two hemispheres would make conclusions on
movement from bulk isotopic data highly speculative. Further biochemical analyses would
likely be needed such as fatty acid analysis and compound specific stable isotope analysis to
better characterise and distinguish between the north and south tropical pacific regions.
Zooplankton also shows considerable range of d13C and d15N values (Supplementary
Material), and this, along with potential inter-individual and inter-annual effects on manta
d13C and d15N values, could be discussed in further detail.
Accepted. Changed. Additional information on isotopic variability has been added to
the manuscript. In addition, with the number of potential causes of isotopic baseline
variability, the authors feel that further sample collection across multiple years and sites
would be needed to address mechanisms behind this variability in more detail. This
conclusion has also been added to the discussion section of the manuscript.
(p.11, lines 249-253) “Variations in manta rays SI values likely reflect a change in
primary producer composition, but also change in foraging strategies across time. Consistent
with the patchy nature of zooplankton in tropical oceans, manta rays may adapt their foraging
strategies/foraging habitat to available resources”
(p.11, lines 254-256) “Inter annual variability in SI values were found for both manta
rays and surface zooplankton. Enrichment in 13C and 15N seemed to coincide between the two
groups suggesting variations in primary producer composition.”
(p.12, lines 273-276) “To differentiate between the various mechanisms contributing
to isotopic variation in M. birostris in the eastern tropical Pacific, more data are needed on
the isotopic composition of available prey across larger horizontal and vertical areas where
individuals are likely to feed.”
Tagging data-There is no discussion of electronic tagging data that suggest mesopelagic
feeding in reef mantas (Braun et al 2014) and in giant mantas (Stewart et al. 2016). This
electronic tagging bears mention as it directly supports this study’s assertion of mesopelagic
resources in diet of giant mantas.
Agreed and changed.
(p. 10, lines 282-288) “Electronic tag studies on M. birostris, M. alfredi and closely
related Mobula tarapacana have shown that these rays, despite being predominantly surface
dwellers, dive to depths of ~1400m (A. Marshall, unpub data), 432m and 2000m respectively
(Braun et al., 2014, Thorrold et al., 2014). The dive-profiles from each of the studies suggest
that these species forage at depth in the deep scattering layers. In addition, video of M.
birostris taken at depth with a submersible vehicle confirms that individuals forage on
mesopelagic sources in the Mexican east Pacific region (Stewart et al., 2017).”
A key issue with the data is that they don’t collect the mesopelagic zooplankton from the
same area as their study, with isotopic values of plankton being quite variable.
Agreed and additional information has been added to the manuscript to make this
explicit. Unfortunately we could not collect mesopelagic zooplankton samples because we
could not sample at night and during the daytime mesopelagic zooplankton can sit anywhere
between 400-800m and we only had access to a small boat during field work in Ecuador.
(p. 6, lines 156-158) “There are no demersal, benthic or deep-sea bulk stable isotope
values available for zooplankton from coastal Ecuador and unfortunately, due to logistical
constraints we could not sample mesopelagic zooplankton from the region.”
Based on this manuscript, there is no data on residency times
Accepted. At present, residency times are not available, but are being worked up.
However, we appreciate it is important to give context in terms of suspected movements of
M. birostris in this area and unpublished recorded diving behaviour of individual M. birostris
from this region has now been added.
(p. 10, lines 282-285) “Electronic tag studies on M. birostris, M. alfredi and closely
related Mobula tarapacana have shown that these rays, despite being predominantly surface
dwellers, dive to depths of ~1400m (A. Marshall, unpub data)”
I felt the authors left out several key papers, including (strikingly) one on stable isotopes and
movements for this species in the eastern Pacific!
Accepted and changed.
Both Stewart 2016 papers are now referenced in the manuscript on p. 9 line 228 and
p. 11 line 288.
Much more details are needed on the mesopelagic zooplankton samples and other fishes and
turtles, used in the analyses. At the moment nothing is given. Were samples lipid extracted?
How were the C:N ratios different? What DTDF values were used? It’s very difficult to have
confidence in cross-species comparisons without this information, and this variability would
not be included in the Bayesian model.
How far do the thresher sharks and tunas move or dive, to make these comparisons
worthwhile? If they are not residents and simply transients, then is the comparison valid?
Accepted. Clarified.
Both Yellowfin Tuna and Thresher sharks are thought to be transient in this region.
However, the authors feel comparisons are valid as both species are commonly caught in
fisheries during the time when M. birostris aggregate in this near coastal location. The
yellowfin tuna isotopic values used here were collected from ~5° N (700km north of the main
study site in the current manuscript) to ~25° N with stock structure thought to be
homoegenous in the eastern Pacific (Ward et al. 1997). Yellowfin tuna are known to feed on
a diverse array of mesopelagic fishes and deep diving behaviour in this species is known to
be on average ~895m in this region (Schaefer et al. 2011, Olson et al. 2016). Thresher sharks
found south of the equator in the eastern Pacific occur between Columbia and Southern Chile
(Compagno, 2001). Off Mexico this species is known to inhabit daytime depths of ~150m but
its diving behaviour off mainland Ecuador is unknown. However, stomach contents from
thresher sharks off mainland Ecuador comprised species known to inhabit depths of up to
500m. The authors feel that given that yellowfin tuna and thresher sharks co-occur off
mainland Ecuador at simultaneous times of the year with manta rays, and that appropriate
baseline for coastal Ecuador was used, the isotopic comparison of multiple species used here
was valid.
(p. 7, lines 185-187) “The isotopic niche structure of other vertebrates that seasonally
co-occur with M. birostris in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and for which isotopic
information is available was compared”
Cross species comparisons were done qualitatively using Bayesian statistics to
determine confidence intervals to look at the isotopic overlap between these large species.
Further information on processing procedures and C:N ratios for the other large vertebrates
used in the qualitative comparison can also now be found in the electronic supplementary
material (2i). For the mixing model, the addition of co-occurring turtle, yellowfin tuna and
thresher sharks would have compromised the model as too many source contributions prevent
a unique solution. This exclusion from the mixing model has now been clarified in the
manuscript.
(p. 6, lines 152-155) “Co-occurring turtles, yellowfin tuna and thresher sharks were
not included in the mixing model as the number of source contributions needed to assess the
diet of all of these species as well M. birostris would have surpassed the number of isotopes
+1.”
The authors use a lot of ANOVA’s which increases the chance of type 2 errors. It would
seem like GLMs could be constructed to simultaneously account for sex, year etc
Accepted. Changed. As we have used categorical predicts, we have now performed
two way ANOVAs, which reduce the errors.
(p. 8, lines 194-199) “For M. birostris muscle tissue d13C and d15N values were -
16.8±1.1‰ and 10.6±1.5‰ respectively. Male (n=45) and female (n=30) d13C values were
indistinguishable from each other and across sampling years (2-way ANOVA: F3,62=1.924;
p=0.13) (table 1). d15N values were not affected by sex (p=0.35) but significantly differed
between biopsies taken in 2014 and 2012 and between 2014 and 2013 (2-way ANOVA:
F3,62= 16.27; p<0.05) (Tukey HSD, p<0.05).”
The feeding ecology, and even mechanics of whale sharks are very different from mantas.
Have there been any observations of mantas foraging on schooling fish?
Accepted. Changed.
(p. 11, lines 264-266) “While the diets of Manta spp. are poorly characterised there
are reports of individuals feeding on zooplankton and small to moderate sized fish
(Compagno and Last, 1999). These observations however were reported before the recent
taxonomic separation of M. birostris and M. alfredi so it is uncertain whether these findings
pertain to both or either species.”
(p. 11, lines 268-270) “Whale sharks have been observed to feed on mysid and
sergestid shrimps as well as ‘bait fish’ while via a continuous ram feeding mode which is
analogous to manta ray feeding mode (Fox et al., 2013, Rohner et al., 2013).”
M. alfredi are also found at oceanic islands
Accepted. Changed
(pp. 12-13, lines 295-300) “Manta birostris is often found in more pelagic locations,
such as around offshore islands, seamounts and in surface waters of continental shelves
(Marshall et al., 2009). In comparison, M. alfredi is a smaller more tropical species, and
while it does occur around oceanic islands it is more commonly found in coastal and reef
habitats, and is generally seen feeding on surface zooplankton, but occasionally, also on
demersal zooplankton (Couturier et al., 2013).”
g 10, line 29-32. I think this point should be made clearer. Although the manta population
appears to be generalist, that may be an artefact of it being made of individual specialists.
That may be what the authors mean, but I am not sure. This could be a valid (although not
confirmed) point.
Accepted. Changed.
(p. 13, lines 309-312) “The d13C composition of consumers reflects that of prey
availability within their habitats and while as a species M. birostris is considered a generalist
carnivore, large differences in d13C of ingested prey types occur among individuals that could
be indicative of individual specialists within this subpopulation.”

erall I think the authors did a good and thorough job addressing the issues in this study.
viding results from 4 mixing models, using 2 different DTDFs and addressing the
ential impact of lipid-normalized plankton were especially nice to see. While there are
l inherent limitations (e.g., lack of DTDFs, locally sampled meso prey), I believe the
hors now make use of the data and information available to them while recognizing
ential shortcomings and alternative explanations.
ow find the Methods and Results to be reasonable, based particularly on more thorough
roaches to mixing models. Aspects of the presentation of results in written form need to
addressed. I think the Discussion in particular needs substantial work. See comments
ow.
58: in the absence of complementary, confirmatory data, I think this statement has to make
uncertainty more clear (e.g., “dietary intake for this species may be of mesopelagic origin”).
-131: you may want to interpret your C/N ratios in the context of the following paper:

eworded.

dible intervals. This should be more explicit.

SCUSSION
ink the structure and content of the Discussion needs to be revisited. As it stands, most of the
cussion serves to address certain assumptions, mention sources of uncertainty, provide
rnative hypotheses, etc (See below for my very general breakdown of each paragraphs
tent):
22-228: diet info is limited
29-238: variation of N, potential horizontal and vertical movement effects
39-252: baseline effects on SI values
54-260: interannual variation in mantas and plankton
61-276: potential for higher TL feeding based on morphology and inter-specific comparisons
77-300: contrasting assumptions of manta feeding (surface zooplankton) with evidence of meso (results here as
as observations from electronic tags and submersibles).
01-316: isotopic niche; comparison to other species
17-328: future approaches to validate diet of mantas
29-336: conclusion
alize that much of this was in response to reviewer comments, and I think the authors have
e a good job stating various limitations and considerations in the Discussion. However, I
k the Discussion needs more description of the results of this study, assuming they ARE
rect. What does this finding mean for Mantas? If mesopelagic prey are important, how might
impact the distributions, fitness, etc of the species? Since the paper is framed in the abstract
intro as somewhat important for conservation and management, the reader needs to know:
at you found, in Discussion format (that unlike previous assumptions, Mantas may feed
p).
y this matters. Does it say anything new about Manta evolution/ecophysiology? Will it
act their migrations? May it affect their residency times at certain aggregations? Etc.
n provide the necessary qualifications, caveats, etc.
example, it seems that Mantas are an example of a large predator existing in relatively
ritionally depauperate regions (surface waters in tropical areas). This is somewhat analogous
xtremely high shark abundances on reefs with ‘inverted’ trophic pyramids. Recent work,
ng SIA, has shown that additional ecosystems must subsidize sharks on some reefs (e.g.
agic resources). Does this study suggest that Mantas are, and perhaps need to be, energetically
sidized by reliable mesopelagic resources? As the mesopelagic zone seems to be the next
ntier for open ocean fisheries, this study may provide an example of why the mesopelagic
e matters to megafauna, and show that in many cases we don’t fully appreciate the reliance of
dators on cryptic prey/habitats.
re specifically, I think Paragraphs 6 and 7 should immediately follow Paragraph 1, and should
expanded to include the reasons the authors think this finding is interesting AND why it is
ortant. Then follow with all the rest.
more specific comments on the Discussion below.
-233: not clear what the meaning is of the comparison with values from Gulf of California.
: not true. d15N varies as a result of trophic differences, AND/OR baseline effects.
-260: variation in SI values over time. Could this variation explain the Manta values, rather
n meso inputs? If you demonstrated that surface zooplankton cannot fully explain Manta
ues (for example, using a mixing model in which you used only surface zooplankton with
hest d13C and d15N values to represent surface zoopl), it would provide even more support that
e other diet source (based on your results, meso sources) must be important.
-260: concludes paragraph with an open statement about yellowfin tuna SI values. What does
mean for observed values in Mantas?
-263: “…may also be a factor”. This is confusing. Is this paragraph talking about the
sopelagic inputs your are proposing? About unknown higher trophic level prey? Do ‘baseline’
nges refer to horizontal/latitudinal baselines, baselines that vary with depth, or both? This and
previous paragraph need to be clearer about horizontal baseline versus vertical baseline
sus trophic differences.
-336: conclusion is somewhat vague and weak. What are the implications of what you found,
at does it explain/suggest, what needs to be done to support/refute/extend results found here?
ble 2: Meso exceeds surface inputs even if you use the lowest estimate for meso (0.62) and
hest for surface (0.38). This is potentially convincing and should be considered to be included
he text.
ure 3: Is there a reason for Dietary Proportion to be in the x-axis? This makes this figure a bit
fusing and difficult to process. As a dependent variable I think this would be more easily
cessed visually with proportion of diet on the y-axis. Should also say “Estimated dietery
portion”, or something similar, as these are estimates from mixing models.
o the key has 3 sources while each model only has 2. I understand that this is a product of
ain models using LN zooplankton and the others using bulk values. However it is confusing.
ggest something that clarifies: maybe a title over 1 and 3 (“Lipid-normalized plankton
ues”) and over 2 and 4 (“Bulk plankton values”)?
Appendix C
We would like thank reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments on this this
latest manuscript. We have endeavoured to address any outstanding issues and incorporate
suggestions that were made.
(reviewers comments highlighted)
Reviewer 1
57-58: in the absence of complementary, confirmatory data, I think this statement has to
make the uncertainty more clear (e.g., “dietary intake for this species may be of mesopelagic
origin”).
Agreed. Changed (57–58). “suggest that the majority of dietary intake for this species
are of mesopelagic origin.”
129-131: you may want to interpret your C/N ratios in the context of the following paper:
Carlisle AB, Litvin SY, Madigan DJ, Lyons K, Bigman J, Ibarra M & JJ Bizarro. 2016. Interactive
effects of urea and lipid content confound stable isotope results in elasmobranchs. Canadian Journal
of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. DOI: 10.1139/cjfas-2015-0584 Which found interesting results
for lipid extraction for SIA of batoids.
We thank the reviewer for bringing this paper to our attention. The lack of
standardised protocol for elasmobranch SIA studies means that there will inevitably be
differences in sample processing. Lipids were extracted from a different subsection of these
same samples, the results of which are currently being analysed for a separate fatty acid
analysis study. Average lipid content was found to be one of the lowest reported for any
elasmobranch species to date (~0.2 mg g-1, K. Burgess, unpub. data) and did not correlate
with C:N ratios. Manta birostris muscle was extremely lean, and following the
recommendations of Carlisle et al. (2016) for other lean batoids, lipid extraction was deemed
unnecessary as such low lipid content would not have affected isotopic compositions or C:N
ratios (Burgess & Bennett, 2016 (doi: 10.1111/jfb.13164)).
160: “isotopic coupling”, does this mean isotopic similarity?
Agreed. Changed (162–163) It has been reworded: “There is strong isotopic similarity
between mesopelagic zooplankton and mesopelagic fishes”
165: mesopelagic source values: are these means for the 11 individuals representing 3
species?
Agreed. Changed. We have clarified (166–168). “Overall mean d13C. and d15N values
from small mesopelagic fish species (C. alba, C. atrum and H. proximum) were -17.6±0.8‰
and 6.2±1.5‰ respectively [22]”.
181: “must…”…this isn’t really true, though such approaches are helpful. This sentence
should be reworded.
Agreed. Changed (186–188)“For inferences on species-interactions and the structure
of communities using biochemical analyses, it is helpful to place the focus species into
context with other co-occurring species [23].”
194: are these mean values? Needs to be clarified throughout when mean values are
presented.
Agreed. Changed. (199). “For M. birostris muscle tissue mean d13C and d15N values
were”
Also included in the methods section (127–128). “Throughout, results are presented as mean
and standard deviation unless otherwise stated.”
210-220: it is not clear how you ‘averaged’ mixing model results and especially mixing
model credible intervals. This should be more explicit.
Agreed. Clarified and changed.
(183–185) “To determine an overall estimate of the mean contribution to the diet of M.
birostris from mesopelagic and surface sources, the mean source contribution for surface
and mesopelagic prey from the four mixing models was averaged.”
(610–616) “Table 2. Mean (± s.d.) source contributions of surface zooplankton and
mesopelagic sources to M. birostris diet from 4 mixing models. Model 1 source inputs
comprised of mesopelagic fishes and lipid normalised surface zooplankton d13C values and
used DTDFs from large sharks [16]. Model 2 source inputs were mesopelagic fishes and
non-lipid normalised surface zooplankton d13C with the large shark DTDF [16]. Models 3
and 4 comprised the same source inputs as model 1 and 2 respectively, but used DTDF
values from T. semifasciata [17]. Also shown is the mean source contribution calculated from
all 4 mixing models.”
Table 2 has also been amended to show the mean source contribution estimates from each of
the four mixing models and also an overall mean from these four models.
217-220: provide in text the source contribution estimates from Model 4 since you are
making the point that it resulted in the highest overlap between surface and meso prey.
Agreed. Changed (224–227). “Model 3, which used an elasmobranch specific d15N
DTDF of 3.7% and lipid normalised surface zooplankton d13C values, had the highest
credible interval overlap of dietary contributions from mesopelagic sources (45-64%) and
surface zooplankton (32-57%) (figure 3, table S4).”
Model numbers 3 and 4 were also swapped to aid in shortening the descriptions of the models
as they are used multiple times in the methods, results and table captions. An additional table
of mixing model quartile results has now also been added to the electronic supplementary
material (table S4).
232-233: not clear what the meaning is of the comparison with values from Gulf of
California.
Agreed. Deleted.
239: not true. d15N varies as a result of trophic differences, AND/OR baseline effects.
Agreed. Changed (298–299). “Natural variation in consumer d15N can be a
consequence of a change in dominant primary producers at the base of a food web [49].”
Other sources of d15N are then discussed further in the manuscript (311–327)
254-260: variation in SI values over time. Could this variation explain the Manta values,
ratherthan meso inputs? If you demonstrated that surface zooplankton cannot fully explain
Mantavalues (for example, using a mixing model in which you used only surface zooplankton
with highest d13C and d15N values to represent surface zoopl), it would provide even more
support that some other diet source (based on your results, meso sources) must be important.
Agreed. Another mixing model incorporating the highest d13C and d15N values from
surface zooplankton and mesopelagic sources was run (Supplementary material, Table S4,
Model 5).
(220–221) All mixing models found mesopelagic sources to generate a majority
contribution in comparison to surface zooplankton to the diet of M. birostris (figure 3, Table
S4).
(ESM 1, 51–53) “In Model 5 (table S4), Surface zooplankton with enriched d13C was
found on average to contribute 31.3 ± 14.3 % to the diet of M. birostris, while surface
zooplankton with enriched d15N contributed 14.2 ± 7.8 % and mesopelagic fishes contributed
54.4 ± 8.3 %.”
258-260: concludes paragraph with an open statement about yellowfin tuna SI values. What
does this mean for observed values in Mantas?
Agreed. Added (303–306) “Therefore, it is possible that high d15N values of some M.
birostris reflect large home ranges that comprise Ecuadorian, and higher latitude waters that
are characterised by higher primary producer and subsequent zooplankton d15N values [49].
261-263: “…may also be a factor”. This is confusing. Is this paragraph talking about the
mesopelagic inputs your are proposing? About unknown higher trophic level prey? Do
‘baseline’changes refer to horizontal/latitudinal baselines, baselines that vary with depth, or
both? This and the previous paragraph need to be clearer about horizontal baseline versus
vertical baseline versus trophic differences.
Agreed. Clarified (306–310) “However, these recorded baseline changes occurred in
surface waters, and surface zooplankton are suspected not to comprise a majority of dietary
intake for M. birostris in this region. It is currently unknown if vertical baseline changes at
depth are similar to or coincide with horizontal baseline changes in surface waters in the
Eastern equatorial Pacific.”
(311–313) “While primary producer baseline changes likely account for some of the
variation in d15N values and trophic position of M. birostris, the targeting of higher trophic
level prey both in surface waters and at depth may also be a factor in high d15N values seen
in this study.”
329-336: conclusion is somewhat vague and weak. What are the implications of what you
found,what does it explain/suggest, what needs to be done to support/refute/extend results
found here?
Agreed. Conclusion expanded. (360–365) “collecting information on low- and mid-
trophic prey communities is challenging and current direct sampling methods are not
adequate to provide enough representative samples. Instead, we can use suitable values
gleaned from the literature and focus on marine top predators to monitor the health of pelagic
food webs as their feeding ecologies and spatial distributions provide a direct insight into
food web dynamics, oceanic productivity and critical megafauna habitats [63].”
(370–375) “This study, along with others, suggests that manta rays and other large
planktivorous elasmobranchs that live in these low latitude patchy marine systems, need to be
energetically subsidized by mesopelagic resources [55]. The mesopelagic zone is the next
frontier for open ocean fisheries [64], and it is concerning that we still do not fully understand
the reliance on this zone by marine megafauna that already face threats in well characterised
surface habitats [47].”
Table 2: Meso exceeds surface inputs even if you use the lowest estimate for meso (0.62)
and highest for surface (0.38). This is potentially convincing and should be considered to be
included in the text.
Agreed. Added (221–224) “The highest estimated source contribution for surface
zooplankton to the diet of M. birostris was 43%, which was still lower than the most
conservative estimate for mesopelagic source contribution (57%) (Model 3).”
Figure 3: Is there a reason for Dietary Proportion to be in the x-axis? This makes this figure a
bit confusing and difficult to process. As a dependent variable I think this would be more
easily processed visually with proportion of diet on the y-axis. Should also say “Estimated
dieteryproportion”, or something similar, as these are estimates from mixing models. Also the
key has 3 sources while each model only has 2. I understand that this is a product of certain
models using LN zooplankton and the others using bulk values. However it is confusing. I
suggest something that clarifies: maybe a title over 1 and 3 (“Lipid-normalized plankton
values”) and over 2 and 4 (“Bulk plankton values”)?
Agreed. Figure 3 edited
What does this finding mean for Mantas? If mesopelagic prey are important, how might
this impact the distributions, fitness, etc of the species? Since the paper is framed in the
abstract and intro as somewhat important for conservation and management, the reader needs
to know: What you found, in Discussion format (that unlike previous assumptions, Mantas
may feed deep).Why this matters. Does it say anything new about Manta
evolution/ecophysiology? Will it impact their migrations? May it affect their residency times
at certain aggregations? Etc.
Agreed. Some extra information on ecophysiology and evolution has been added to
the discussion.
(282–293) “Mesopelagic prey occurs in much cooler temperatures than those in surface
waters. It is thus expected that an ectotherm, such as manta ray, would exhibit compensatory
behaviour for body heat loss after foraging on those prey in cold waters. Studies on large
ectothermic planktivores such as the sunfish and the whale shark showed behavioural
indications of deep feeding, with time spent within mesopelagic depth involving body
temperature decrease always followed by a recovery time in warmer surface waters [45, 46].
Manta rays are commonly seen in surface waters or cleaning in shallow coral reef habitats
typically in tropical or sub-tropical regions [40, 47]. Off mainland Ecuador, M. birostris
aggregate around cleaning stations at Isla de la Plata, which is situated <40 km from a
continental shelf edge that descends to ~3000m [48]. It is possible that a driver behind
aggregative of M. birostris at this site relates to individuals undergoing thermal recovery in
warm surface waters after foraging at depth nearby.”
(245–249) “Planktivory as a feeding strategy has evolved independently in many vertebrate
groups including; whales [36], sharks and teleosts [37]. With adaptive radiation of
planktivorous megafauna species during the cenzoic era concurrent with changes in global
climate that included increased productivity along with amplified patchiness of marine
systems [38].”
The understanding of drivers of migration and residency times of manta rays is still in its
infancy. Given this, the patchiness of mesopelagic prey, and lack of deep sea sampling in this
region to determine where prey patches might be, interpretation of the current data with
inferences on migratory behaviour would be highly speculative.
In terms of effects on residency time, muscle is not an appropriate tissue to use in this
instance as it is representative of an average integrated dietary signal and can take up to a
year to reach isotopic equilibrium. Manta rays are only seasonally present at Isla de la Plata
and acoustic telemetry results from this aggregation site are currently being analysed. To
couple acoustic telemetry results with stable isotope analyses to assess residency times a
tissue with a much faster turnover time would be needed. At present the only validated fast
turnover tissues for elasmobranchs are blood plasma and liver which are extremely difficult
to sample from free swimming animals.
Then provide the necessary qualifications, caveats, etc.
For example, it seems that Mantas are an example of a large predator existing in relatively
nutritionally depauperate regions (surface waters in tropical areas). This is somewhat
analogous to extremely high shark abundances on reefs with ‘inverted’ trophic pyramids.
Recent work, using SIA, has shown that additional ecosystems must subsidize sharks on
some reefs (e.g.pelagic resources). Does this study suggest that Mantas are, and perhaps need
to be, energetically subsidized by reliable mesopelagic resources? As the mesopelagic zone
seems to be the next frontier for open ocean fisheries, this study may provide an example of
why the mesopelagic zone matters to megafauna, and show that in many cases we don’t fully
appreciate the reliance of predators on cryptic prey/habitats.
Agreed. Additional sentences added at the end of the conclusion to frame findings
from this study in a conservation context.
(370–375) “This study, along with others, suggests that manta rays and other large
planktivorous elasmobranchs that live in these low latitude patchy marine systems, need to be
energetically subsidized by mesopelagic resources [55]. The mesopelagic zone is the next
frontier for open ocean fisheries [64], and it is concerning that we still do not fully understand
the reliance on this zone by marine megafauna that already face threats in well characterised
surface habitats [47].”
More specifically, I think Paragraphs 6 and 7 should immediately follow Paragraph 1, and
should be expanded to include the reasons the authors think this finding is interesting AND
why it is important.
Agreed. Paragraphs moved and expanded (244–281).
(268–269) “The results from the mixing model in the current study are consistent with the
idea that this submersible footage may be indicative of a common event.”
(276–281) “Additionally, expected enrichments in <U+2206>13C and <U+2206>15N for large shark species
[17] occurred between M. birostris (a secondary consumer) and the thresher shark, a tertiary
level consumer that typically inhabits the upper regions of the water column but obtains the
majority of its diet from the mesopelagic environment [28]. These expected enrichments
indicate that both of these elasmobranch species are feeding within the same mesopelagic
food web.”
Reviewer 2
My primary concern is still the fact that the mesopelagic source isotopes were taken a long
way from the study site. I completely understand that the authors did not have the power to
sample at their site….that doesn’t remove the issue however… I don’t see a way around this
other than perhaps making very clear in the discussion the potentially serious issue of
assuming the mesopelagic isotope source are representative of the study site
Agreed. We have now made it very clear in the Discussion that mesopelagic sources
were meant to be representative of offshore mesopelagic sources, not solely of the study site,
which sits on the continental shelf surrounded by depths of 50-200m. Diving behaviour from
the tags has shown individuals to go to much deeper than that which would not be possible
unless they were offshore. Additional information has also been added on using a top down
approach for assessing ecosystem interactions using stable isotope analysis.
(164–166) “from the NPSG with equivalent trophic positions to primary and secondary
copepod consumers (2.1 – 2.9 [22]) were used as a representative offshore mesopelagic food
source.”
(360–366) “However, collecting information on low- and mid-trophic prey communities
is challenging and current direct sampling methods are not adequate to provide enough
representative samples. Instead, we can use suitable values gleaned from the literature and
focus on marine top predators to monitor the health of pelagic food webs as their feeding
ecologies and spatial distributions provide a direct insight into food web dynamics, oceanic
productivity and critical megafauna habitats [61].
(330–347). “A potential limitation of this study is the assumption that mesopelagic
isotope values from the NPSG are representative of mesopelagic sources, offshore of
mainland Ecuador and the broader Eastern Equatorial Pacific region, which M. birostris of
this sub-population feeds. There might be expected differences in isotopic values as the
NPSG is less productive than the coastal upwelling Eastern Boundary Current (EBC) system
off Ecuador, where a shallow thermocline facilitates enhanced nutrient supply [59]. Small
average differences in d13C (0.7‰) were been found between mesopelagic fishes collected in
the NPSG and another EBC (California), with larger differences occurring in d15N (8.5‰)
[60]. However, different species were collected between these two sites and there were
considerable differences in maximum sizes of mesopelagic fish sampled from California
(490mm) compared to those collected from the NSPG (277mm). Additionally, mean bulk
trophic position estimates for mesopelagic fish collected from the NSPG (2.2) were much
lower those for California (3.8) and this could have attributed to the overserved large
difference in d15N values between the two regions [60]. In another study, there was no
predictable difference in d15N values of northern fur seals that forage inshore (California) or
offshore (140–180° W, NPSG), however, northern fur seals are not mesopelagic feeders [61].
There is no current consensus whether isotopic values would differ between mesopelagic
sources in the NSPG and off mainland Ecuador given that there is no data for the latter.”
Especially, as there is some recent evidence suggesting more residential behavior at east
pacific islands.
I think the addition of some satellite telemetry would really strengthen the paper. When I read
one of the authors had data showing mantas diving deep, I was a lot more confident in their
conclusions. I assume they are preparing a separate paper, but even one diving plot would be
useful.
Unfortunately, this satellite tracking data is part of a separate project and is not
available for this publication. We have included information on the movements and diving
behaviour in its most general form to support the findings here.
(263–264) “these rays, despite being predominantly surface dwellers, dive to depths
of ~1400m (A. Marshall, unpub data)”.
We are aware that a recent paper by Stewart et al., (2016) showed restricted
movements of M. birostris off Mexico. However, restricted movements are not currently
recognised as the standard for this species (IUCN Red List, ‘Geographic range’). Manta
birostris was successfully added to Appendices I and II to the Convention on the
Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) in 2014, and additional information, albeit
unpublished, on its wide-ranging movements worldwide can be found in the proposal for this
species’ inclusion on the CMS appendices:
(http://www.cms.int/sites/default/files/document/1_5_manta_birostris_rev1_e.pdf)
A manuscript comprising satellite tagging results for M. birostris on a global scale is
also currently being prepared by a co-author of this paper. While we appreciate this is
unpublished data, this global analysis has found this is a migratory species that does not show
residency to specific areas. Manta birostris in Ecuador regularly make international
migrations and some tracks show them spending over 50% of their time in off shelf
environments.
I do have a concern with their trophic position estimates. They are using surface zooplankton
as baseline but the mixing model suggests surface zooplankton is a minor component of the
diet. Is it a valid measure of ‘baseline’ when calculating trophic position?
Agreed. Changed. While surface zooplankton likely comprise a minor part of M. birostris’
diet, with the suspected varying degrees reported in the manuscript (table 2, table S4), M.
birostris have been directly observed foraging on surface zooplankton off mainland Ecuador
and the authors felt that its inclusion as a nitrogen source for M. birostris was valid.
However, we appreciate that the initial d15N baseline used did not encompass suspected
mesopelagic feeding.
(142–147) “To account for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in baseline values, the
d15Nprimary used (7‰) was the average d15N value of surface zooplankton that was collected at
Isla de la Plata during 2013-2014 and mesopelagic fish species collected from the North
Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) in 2009-2011 [16]. An integer value of 2.5 was used, as
surface zooplankton tows and mesopelagic fish species comprised a mixture of primary
(TL=2) and secondary consumers (TL=3).”
Trophic position estimates have also been updated in the manuscript (204–206) and in the
electronic supplementary material (table S1). Mean trophic positions estimates with the new
baseline increased slightly (from 3.2-3.6 to 3.4-3.7) but with no accompanying change to
ecological interpretation of the data. The new trophic position estimates still support the
conclusion that M. birostris are at least secondary consumers in the E. tropical pacific.
I see no problem with comparing isoscapes with those from other predators in the area.
However, the authors state that the tunas and thresher sharks are transient. Presumably
therefore, the isotopic signature of their muscle is not representative of the study site as the
turnover times are going to be several months or longer?
Agreed. M. birostris and co-occurring higher level organisms featured here are
seasonal transients that were meant to provide an initial and simplified overview of food web
dynamics off mainland Ecuador. Muscle is the most reliable tissue to use for an average, low
resolution signal of diet but does have a slow turnover time. Muscle tissue turnover time in
elasmobranchs is ~240-360 days (Caut et a., 2009, MacNeil et al., 2006) and large teleosts
has a half-life of 167-255 days (Madigan et al., 2012). However, Figure 1 shows expected
enrichments of isotopic measurement between primary, secondary and tertiary consumers
from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific. This indicates that despite these sampled vertebrates
being transient and slightly differing tissue turnover times, muscle tissue was representative
of trophic interactions within this system.
(276–281) “Additionally, expected enrichments in <U+2206>13C and <U+2206>15N for large shark species
[17] occurred between M. birostris, a secondary consumer, and the thresher shark; a tertiary
consumer that typically inhabits the upper regions of the water column but obtains the
majority of its diet from the mesopelagic environment [28]. These expected enrichments
indicate that both of these elasmobranch species are feeding within the same mesopelagic
food web. “
Limitations of not being able to sample more prey items from this system (324–327, 345–
347), and general limitations of stable isotope analysis are also outlined in the Discussion:
(354–365) “the low resolution of bulk SIA precludes detailed dietary assessment from this
technique alone, and critical values such as isotopic incorporation rate and diet tissue
discrimination factors need to be determined experimentally for planktivorous elasmobranchs
to aid interpretation of SIA results. In addition, better biochemical characterisation of
potential prey sources, such as mesopelagic and demersal zooplankton, over various spatio-
temporal scales would assist in interpretations of unexpected biochemical profiles of
consumers. However, collecting information on low- and mid-trophic prey communities is
challenging and current direct sampling methods are not adequate to provide enough
representative samples. Instead, we can use suitable values gleaned from the literature and
focus on marine top predators to monitor the health of pelagic food webs as their feeding
ecologies and spatial distributions provide a direct insight into food web dynamics, oceanic
productivity and critical megafauna habitats [61].”
Line 293. This statement is true for all animals!
Agreed. Deleted.
Line 315 I am confused by this sentence. It implies (as written) that mantas also eat humbolt
and flying squid
Agreed. Clarified (276–281). “Additionally, expected enrichments in <U+2206>13C and <U+2206>15N
for large shark species [17] occurred between M. birostris, a secondary consumer, and the
thresher shark; a tertiary consumer that typically inhabits the upper regions of the water
column but obtains the majority of its diet from the mesopelagic environment [28]. These
expected enrichments indicate that both of these elasmobranch species are feeding within the
same mesopelagic food web. “
Fig. 1. For the comparison of m.alfredi why do the authors use an estimate from Australia?
There is data from the central Pacific (McCauley et al. 2015. Mar. Biol.) which is much
closer geographically that a study site in Australia.
Agreed. M. alfredi from E. Australia removed from figure 1. Comparisons between
M. alfredi and M. birostris are now just featured in the text.
(234-236) “Our SIA results placed M. birostris at a relative trophic position similar to that of
other mobulids; Mobula mobular (3.6) [29], Mobula thurstoni (3.3) [30] and M. alfredi (3)
[31]”
Further comparison with the data McCauley et al. (2015) was not attempted as this study did
not present d13C values and their mixing models were conducted using d34S and d15N.
