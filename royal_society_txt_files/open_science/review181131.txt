The content is technically correct. However, it is not placed in proper perspective. Some
comments are given below:
1. The names of the proposed group of transforms and the resulting analytic signals should be
suggestive that they are derived from the sine and cosine transforms.
2. Many signals can have same spectrum, and we know the reason for this fact. Now, one signal
is having sixteen different time-frequency distributions. What is the meaning of this revelation?
3. Some discussion on why we need the above transforms will be highly desirable.

The revised manuscript presents novel Fourier quadrature transforms and analytic signal
representations for nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis. The manuscript appears to
be improved considerably by incorporating suggestions made by the reviewers. Although the
language of the manuscript is in an acceptable level, it might be useful to get it read by a
language expert as there are always some grammatical errors. For example, in page 9, line 4 from
the bottom, delete "An" at the beginning of the sentence to start as "Estimation of...". Also, change
"a" to "the" in "...is a most important..." to read as "...is the most important...".

The content is technically correct. However, it is not placed in proper perspective. Some comments are
given below:
Response: Author would like to thank reviewer for providing comments to improve the manuscript.
1. The names of the proposed group of transforms and the resulting analytic signals should be
suggestive that they are derived from the sine and cosine transforms.
Response: The sine and cosine transforms are variants of the Fourier transform for odd and even signal,
respectively. Therefore, we designated the proposed transforms in continuous-time domain as “Fourier
cosine quadrature transforms (FCQT)” and “Fourier sine quadrature transform (FSQT)” and these
FCQT and FSQT are combinedly designated as the Fourier Quadrature Transforms (FQTs). In discrete-
time domain, due to four boundary conditions (even or odd two choices at both left and right end; two
choices of symmetric about a data point or the point halfway between two data points) there are sixteen
variants of discrete sine and cosine transforms (eight discrete FCQTs and discrete FSQTs). Now, as per
suggestion, we have designated eight analytic signals as DCTs based analytic signal representations
(DCT-ASRs) and another eight analytic signals as DSTs based analytic signal representations (DST-
ASRs), and combinedly designated as discrete Fourier quadrature analytic signal (FQAS)
representations. All changes are highlighted in the revised version of the manuscript.
2. Many signals can have same spectrum, and we know the reason for this fact. Now, one signal is
having sixteen different time-frequency distributions. What is the meaning of this revelation?
Response: There are two continuous-time sine and cosine transforms and in discrete-time domain, due
to four boundary conditions, there are sixteen variants of discrete sine and cosine transforms. Moreover,
there is main difference of boundary condition among DCTs and DSTs. Therefore, there is main
difference of boundary condition among sixteen time-frequency distributions produced by the proposed
method. As the DCTs present energy compaction and decorrelation property, and thus energy should
be concentrated more in the low frequency components of time-frequency plane. To obtain the definite
revelation of sixteen time-frequency distributions, we need to perform comprehensive study of each
time-frequency distribution and this would be future direction of research.
3. Some discussion on why we need the above transforms will be highly desirable.
Response: Many time-frequency-representation approaches such as the empirical mode decomposition
(EMD) algorithms and its variants, Fourier decomposition method (FDM), variational mode
decomposition (VMD) are primarily based on the Hilbert transform (HT) and Gabor analytic signal
(GAS) representation which are well-known and widely-used in numerous applications. Practically, the
HT and GAS are implemented using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) which is efficiently computed
using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. This study proposes sixteen FQTs as alternatives of the
HT, sixteen FQAS representations as alternatives of the GAS, and presents detailed simulation results
using DCT type-2 based FQT and FQAS which provides better results, e.g., in terms of accurate
instantaneous frequency estimation (Figure 2 and 3) and higher output SNR (Figure 5 c) in many but
limited applications considered in this work. Moreover, the proposed novel methodology produces
better results, provides alternative ways of time-series representation and analysis, advances the existing
Fourier decomposition method (FDM) which is useful many applications [1], and thus proposed
transforms and corresponding analytic signal representations are needed. Finally, as the DFT and DCTs
are widely used tools in numerous different sets of applications, so our future direction of research
would be to explore proposed FQTs and corresponding analytic signal representations in various
applications. This discussion is presented in the conclusion section of the revised version of the
manuscript.

Recently, a new technique for time-frequency analysis which is based on improved eigenvalue
decomposition and Wigner-Ville distribution has been proposed for cross-terms free time-frequency
representation for multicomponent non-stationary signals. Please see the following paper:
R.R. Sharma and R.B. Pachori, Improved eigenvalue decomposition-based approach for reducing cross-
erms in Wigner-Ville distribution, Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing, vol. 37, issue 08, pp. 3330-
3350, August 2018.
Authors should discuss this method in the Introduction part of the paper. Also, explain how your
proposed method is better than the above mentioned method can be explained.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper.
The above paper is based on the Wigner-Ville distribution which suffers from cross terms interference,
however they are reduced (but not eliminated) in the mentioned study. On the other hand, the Fourier
decomposition method (FDM) is based on the Fourier theory and zero-phase filtering [1,2]. The FDM
can decompose real as well as complex signals (which can be multichannel or multivariate) into a set
of desired number of Fourier intrinsic band functions (FIBFs) with desired cutoff frequencies.
In the other paper, authors have proposed a new method for time-frequency analysis using eigenvalue
decomposition of Hankel matrix for complex signals. Please see below paper for more information.

representation of complex signals, Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing, vol. 37, issue 08, pp. 3313-
3329, August 2018.
The paper needs to cite this paper and should mention about the extension of the presented approach
for time-frequency analysis for complex signals.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper.
As mentioned above, the FDM can produce time-frequency distribution (TFD) of complex signals, as
analytic FIBFs are obtained in FDM and for a complex signal sum of FIBFs is the original complex
signal.
Recently, authors have proposed a new approach for time-frequency analysis using Fourier-Bessel
series expansion based empirical wavelet transform and normalized Hilbert transform in the following
paper:
A. Bhattacharyya, L. Singh, and R.B. Pachori, Fourier-Bessel series expansion based empirical wavelet
ransform for analysis of non-stationary signals, Digital Signal Processing, vol. 78, pp. 185-196, July
2018.
Authors should discuss this approach and developed method in the manuscript.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper
The other paper in literature develops a new method for time-frequency distribution based on improved
eigenvalue decomposition and Hilbert transform.
R.R. Sharma and R.B. Pachori, Time-frequency representation using IEVDHM-HT with application to
classification of epileptic EEG signals, IET Science, Measurement & Technology, vol. 12, issue 01, pp.
72-82, January 2018.
How the presented method is better than the suggested method in this paper? Please mention it in the
paper.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper.
The FDM is computationally efficient due to FFT implementation, produces desired number of FIBFs
with required cutoff frequencies, however, these features are difficult to achieve using IEVDHM-HT.
In the literature, time-frequency analysis has been proposed for multivariate signals. Please see below
paper.
A. Bhattacharyya and R.B. Pachori, A multivariate approach for patient specific EEG seizure detection
using empirical wavelet transform, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, vol. 64, no. 09, pp.
2003-2015, September 2017.
How the presented method can be extended for multivariate signals. This can be included as a future
direction of this work with respect to the above mentioned paper.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper
as an example of time-frequency application. Thanks for suggestion, as already mentioned, presented
method i.e. FDM is valid for multichannel or multivariate signals, and future direction of research would
be to explore the application of FDM for patient specific EEG seizure detection.
In the literature, tunable-Q wavelet transform together with Wigner-Ville distribution has been studied
for improving Wigner-Ville distribution based time-frequency analysis in the following paper:
R.B. Pachori and A. Nishad, Cross-terms reduction in Wigner-Ville distribution using tunable-Q
wavelet transform, Signal Processing, vol. 120, pp. 288-304, March 2016.
How proposed method is different than this method for time-frequency analysis. Please mention in your
paper.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper
as an example of time-frequency method. Above paper is based on tunable-Q wavelet transform with
Wigner-Ville distribution for time-frequency analysis of signal, however proposed method is based on
the Fourier theory (i.e. DCTs, DSTs and DFT).
Fourier-Bessel series expansion based time-order representation has been proposed for time-frequency
analysis for speech signals in the following paper:
P. Jain and R.B. Pachori, Time-order representation based method for epoch detection from speech
signals, Journal of Intelligent Systems, vol. 21, issue 1, pp. 79-95, February 2012.
How your method is expected to be better than this method? Please explain in the paper.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper
as an example of time-frequency application for epoch detection from speech signals. The future
direction of research would be to explore the application of FDM for epoch detection from speech
signals.
In another method of time-frequency analysis, Fourier-Bessel series expansion based component
separation has been used together with Wigner-Ville distribution for improved time-frequency
representation in the below paper.
R.B. Pachori and P. Sircar, A new technique to reduce cross terms in the Wigner distribution, Digital
Signal Processing, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 466-474, March 2007.
Please explain your method with respect to the presented method in the above mentioned paper.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper
as an example of time-frequency method which reduces cross terms in the Wigner distribution. The
FDM is a different method for time-frequency representation than the Wigner distribution approach.
Various applications of the developed method have been studied. Same applications have been reported
n the below mentioned papers.
Recently, authors have proposed a new method for instantaneous fundamental frequency estimation
using eigenvalue decomposition of the Hankel matrix in the following paper:
P. Jain and R.B. Pachori, Event-based method for instantaneous fundamental frequency estimation from
voiced speech based on eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrix, IEEE/ACM Transactions on
Audio, Speech and Language Processing, vol. 22. issue 10, pp. 1467-1482, October 2014.
Authors should also discuss the above mentioned paper in the interpretation of the obtained results using
he proposed method.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper
as an example of time-frequency application for instantaneous fundamental frequency estimation from
voiced speech. Instantaneous fundamental frequency estimation results obtained from the FDM are
compared with suggested method.
The manuscript has also studied application of the proposed method for baseline wander removal.
Recently, a new method based on the eigenvalue decomposition has been proposed for the same
application. Please see the below reference.
R.R. Sharma and R.B. Pachori, Baseline wander and power line interference removal from ECG signals
using eigenvalue decomposition, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, vol. 45, pp. 33-49, August
2018.
Please discuss your obtained results for this application with reference to the above mentioned paper.
Response: As per suggestion, the above paper has been discussed in the introduction part of the paper
as an example of time-frequency application for Baseline wander and power line interference removal
from ECG signals, and we discussed the results obtained from the proposed method with respect to this
suggested paper.

The revised manuscript presents novel Fourier quadrature transforms and analytic signal representations
for nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis. The manuscript appears to be improved
considerably by incorporating suggestions made by the reviewers. Although the language of the
manuscript is in an acceptable level, it might be useful to get it read by a language expert as there are
always some grammatical errors. For example, in page 9, line 4 from the bottom, delete "An" at the
beginning of the sentence to start as "Estimation of...". Also, change "a" to "the" in"...is a most
mportant..." to read as "...is the most important...".
Response: Author would like to thank reviewer for providing comments on the proposed methods and
also for suggesting to improve the language of the paper. As suggested, we have got the revised
manuscript read by a language expert and filtered out such mistakes.
