Eco-friendly synthesis of VO2 with stripped pentavalent vanadium solution extracted from
vanadium-bearing shale by hydrothermal in high yield
Manuscript ID: RSOS-181116
After careful reading this manuscript, I cannot recommend this to be published in Royal society
open science at the current form. However, it can be published after major revision if the authors
addressed all the issues raised.
Major Revision:
1. The experimental methodologies and material preparation are not new. Hence, a clear
statement to the novelty of the work presented is necessary. Further, how did you choose 1073K
for 1 h (stripped vanadium) and 220° C for 8h (VO2)? Are it's optimized conditions?
2. The quality of fig. 3 (SEM pictures) is not sufficient for the publication
3. The electrode materials are characterized using a half-cell test configuration which is quite
routine. Hence, authors need to provide the full device characterization for making the
3
manuscript publishable.
4. The author had prepared their electrode material using 20 % acetylene black which will have a
massive impact on the electrochemical measurement, So, we can’t able to justify the true nature of
the VO2(B) as the cathode material.
5. The author needs to elaborate on the electrochemical method in the revised manuscript.
6. The mass loading of the electrode needs to be provided in the revised manuscript.
7. Surface area and pore size analysis plays a vital role in the electrochemical properties of any
material. Authors need to provide the BET analysis of the VO2 in the revised manuscript.
8. Long-term cyclic stability is one of the main aspects of electrode material to implement in the
practical applications.so author needs to perform cyclic stability in the revised manuscript.
9. The charge transfer kinetics and to evaluate the capacitive nature of the VO2 electrode material
EIS analysis need to be performed in the revised manuscript.
10. Some literature about novel energy storage devices should be cited in suitable places.

Comments on # RSOS-181116
Authors synthesized the VO2(B) nanorods by an efficient and eco-friendly
hydrothermal process with stripped vanadium solution. Various
characterization technique were used in order to find the structure,
morphology of the sample such as XRD, Raman spectrum, SEM to show the
as-synthesized VO2 is a pure phase. Further materials were tested for cathode
electrode in Li-ion batteries, which exhibit an initial specific capacity of 192.3
mAh/g and its capacity decreased to 95 mAh/g after 20 cycles.
[1] Authors should add clear TEM, HRTEM, SAED analysis of there
nanorod samples.
[2] What is the long term cyclic stability of the materials ?
[3] Detail analysis of XPS needed in order to support the supercapacitor
performance results.
[4] Have authors fabricated coin cell device or actual practical device?
Authors can add this data.

Point-by-point responses to the referees’ comments
Dear Editor and Reviewers,
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript. The
authors thank cordially the editor and two anonymous reviewers for giving us an opportunity to
improve the manuscript. These comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and
improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our research. We studied
your comments carefully and have made revisions thoroughly which we hope meet with your
approval. The specific corrections in the manuscript and the responds to the reviewer’s comments
are as follows:
Responses to Reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1: Authors synthesized the VO2(B) nanorods by an efficient and eco-friendly
hydrothermal process with stripped vanadium solution. Various characterization technique were
used in order to find the structure, morphology of the sample such as XRD, Raman spectrum,
SEM to show the as-synthesized VO2 is a pure phase. Further materials were tested for cathode
electrode in Li-ion batteries, which exhibit an initial specific capacity of 192.3 mAh/g and its
capacity decreased to 95 mAh/g after 20 cycles.
1. Authors should add clear TEM, HRTEM, SAED analysis of these nanorod samples.
Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. According to your advice, TEM, HRTEM,
SAED have been applied to analyze the microscopic morphology, electron diffraction, orientation
of the crystal plane and the direction of growth of the material (shown in Fig. 7).
2. What is the long term cyclic stability of the materials ?
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have added the long term cyclic stability test of the
materials and analyzed its performance (shown in Fig. 8a) in the revised manuscript.
3. Detail analysis of XPS needed in order to support the supercapacitor performance results.
Response: We agree with you that XPS could support the supercapacitor performance results.
XPS test of the material and detail analysis have been added (Fig. 5 in the revised manuscript) in
the revised manuscript.
4. Have authors fabricated coin cell device or actual practical device? Authors can add this data.
Response: Thanks for your constructive suggestion. I`m regret that we have not fabricated coin
cell device or actual practical device. Our research group just started the study on the synthesis
and electrochemical research of VO2, and this research will be carried out in the near future.
5. Some of the relevant literature data need to be added. For example, these important references
are missing in the manuscript. Journal of Alloys and Compounds 695, (2017) 154-161;
Microporous and Mesoporous Materials 244, (2017) 101-108; Applied Surface Science 418,
(2017) 2-8; RSC Advances 5 (2015), 80990-80997; European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry
2015 (11), 1973–1980. RSC Advances 5, (2015) 88796 – 88804; Journal of Physics and
Chemistry of Solids (2018), DOI: 10.1016/j.jpcs.2018.02.020
Response: Thanks for your recommendation to cite these papers describing the electrochemical
research. We read these papers carefully and have cited them in the revised manuscript.
Reviewer #2: After careful reading this manuscript, I cannot recommend this to be published in
Royal society open science at the current form. However, it can be published after major revision
if the authors addressed all the issues raised.
1.The experimental methodologies and material preparation are not new. Hence, a clear statement
to the novelty of the work presented is necessary. Further, how did you choose 1073K for 1 h
(stripped vanadium) and 220°C for 8h (VO2)? Are it's optimized conditions?
Response: Thank you very much for your careful review. Hydrothermal synthesis is commonly
used to synthesize VO2, but it is indeed that this method is the first time to be used to prepare VO2
(B) with stripped pentavalent vanadium solution. Besides, stripped pentavalent vanadium solution
is different from pure V2O5 as vanadium source because the former contains certain amounts of
impurities such as Fe, Al, P, Si. The synthesized VO2(B) obtained in this experiment is pure phase
material, indicating that stripped pentavalent solution with a certain amounts of impurities also can
be used to synthesize VO2, which has never been reported before.
The vanadium-bearing shale for the preparation of stripped pentavalent vanadium solution is
calcined at a temperature of 800 °C for 1 hour. Under this condition, vanadium can be effectively
leached from the ore, which have been intensively studied by our group. The synthesis condition
of 220 °C and 8 hours is obtained after the temperature and time exploration tests, which have
been sorted and added in the revised manuscript.
2. The quality of fig. 3 (SEM pictures) is not sufficient for the publication.
Response: Thank you very much for your careful review. We have replaced Fig. 6 by a new one
which is sufficient for the publication in the revised manuscript.
3. The electrode materials are characterized using a half-cell test configuration which is quite
routine. Hence, authors need to provide the full device characterization for making the
manuscript publishable.
Response: In the early literature review stage, we found that the half-cell is used to characterize
the electrode material, and the full battery is used to study the overall system properties of the
battery. What we want to investigate is the nature of the prepared VO2 (B) as an electrode material,
so the authors chose half-cell characterization.
4. The author had prepared their electrode material using 20 % acetylene black which will have a
massive impact on the electrochemical measurement, So, we can’t able to justify the true nature
of the VO2(B) as the cathode material.
Response: Because of acetylene black has the advantages of higher electronic conductivity, small
particle size, and isotropy, the migration rate of electrons in the battery can be increased.
Therefore, acetylene black is often used as a conductive agent for electrode materials. The choice
of adding 20% acetylene black in this experiment is the result of reference to a large amount of
relevant literatures.
5. The author needs to elaborate on the electrochemical method in the revised manuscript.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have elaborated on the electrochemical method in the
revised manuscript.
6. The mass loading of the electrode needs to be provided in the revised manuscript.
Response: Thank you very much for your careful review. The mass loading of the electrode has
been provided in the revised manuscript.
7. Surface area and pore size analysis plays a vital role in the electrochemical properties of any
material. Authors need to provide the BET analysis of the VO2 in the revised manuscript.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We added BET test of the material and analyzed effect of
surface area in the revised manuscript.
8. Long-term cyclic stability is one of the main aspects of electrode material to implement in the
practical applications.so author needs to perform cyclic stability in the revised manuscript.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We added the long term cyclic stability test of the material
and analyzed its performance (shown in Fig. 8a) in the revised manuscript.
9. The charge transfer kinetics and to evaluate the capacitive nature of the VO2 electrode material
EIS analysis need to be performed in the revised manuscript.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We added the EIS analysis (shown in Fig. 8e) of the
material to describe the charge transfer kinetics and to evaluate the capacitive nature of the VO2
electrode material in the revised manuscript.
10. Some literature about novel energy storage devices should be cited in suitable places.
