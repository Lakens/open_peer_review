This paper describes a method for preparing methoxime derivatives of aromatic aldehydes and
ketones. The difference of this from other oximatino methods lies in the use of a catalyst which
makes the process somewhat more efficient. Experiments were performed to find the best
catalyst, promoter, solvent and additives. Then the process was shown to work well and give
good yields (79-100 %) of oximes for a good range of aromatic carbonyl compounds. A
reasonable mechanism is also proposed. The research seems satisfactory, if a little humdrum.
Compounds have been satisfactorily characterised as judged by the spectroscopic details in the
text and the NMR spectra in the ESM. This will be an alternative to classic methods that might
be useful to preparative organic chemists on occasion. A number of points need attention:
Figure 1 shows 8 quite complex oxime-containing materials. The authors did not attempt to
prepare any of them, or anything of like complexity so 8 seem somewhat superfluous. 3 or 4
would be quite sufficient to make their point.
The linewidth of the text changes in an erratic way that is distracting and needs attention.
Most of the information in the “General Information” and “Materials” sections is quite standard
and most of this should be transferred to the ESM.
Compounds 2b-f, 2h, 2k-q, 2s-v are known compounds; their spectroscopic data is already in the
literature so there is no point in including it in the main text. The spectroscopic data for these
compounds should be transferred to the ESM.
Page 6, line 58 and elsewhere. It is mentioned that experiments showed no special protection
against moisture was needed. However, the reagent itself CeCl3.7H2O contains water so this
will already be present. It is fairly obvious, therefore, that protection against moisture would not
be needed.
The three column format for the references section makes them very difficult to read and check.
This is made worse by the fact that multiple references under one citation number appear. The
article is a straightforward paper not a review so I suggest omitting some for the 4extensive lists
and only giving leading references.

This manuscript describes an efficient CeCl3.7H2O-based catalytic method for the methoximation
of aromatic aldehydes and ketones under mild conditions and demonstrated that the system is
also operative on their aliphatic counterparts and for the synthesis of acetophenone oximes. This
efficacious reagent reduced substantially the reaction times, the amounts of MeONH2.HCl and
base required, and afforded very good to excellent product yields. In view of the importance of
the product, this work is a very important contribution in the field, and is of great interest to
organic chemist. I recommend the publication of this manuscript in Royal Society Open Science.

This manuscript details a method for transforming ketones and aldehydes into methoximes using
a Lewis acid catalyst. The method provides these useful derivatives in high yields in very short
reaction times. There are several applications for these compounds and this represents a useful
improvement over conventional Bronsted acid-mediated methods. Acceptance is recommended
provided that the following points may be adequately addressed.
The justification for choosing CeCl3 over MnCl2 should be expanded. Whereas MnCl2 is
substantially less expensive that the Ce salt, and both appear to function at a very similar efficient
(compare entries 13 & 14, Table 1) it appears to be perhaps more practical to favor MnCl2.
4
The authors tout the water tolerance of the reaction conditions, but the experimental procedure
describes significant lengths taken to dry both the solvent and the NaOAc additive. The authors
do a nice job addressing the tolerance of water as a component of the solvent mixture, but the
necessity to dry the NaOAc salt is not addressed. Is this really necessary? It would be quite
advantageous to report a transformation where no special precautions were take with any of the
reagents, and each was simply used as received from suppliers.
CeCl3 appears to deliver a significant rate enhancement. One advantage of such a catalyzed
reaction might be to carry out the transformation at lower temperature to avoid undesired side
reactions with sensitive molecules. Temperature studies are not reported in this manuscript, but
would be of great interest to some readers.
The authors measure the pH of solutions of MeONH2•HCl in EtOH with various amounts of
NaOAc, observing the different quantities of the salt yield a solution with very similar pH values.
This might be expected since this is effectively a buffer solution. The puzzling point is that the
authors claim that this demonstrates the “robustness of the method.” It is difficult to determine
what the authors are trying to state here, other than perhaps this protocol would tolerate errors in
weighing out the NaOAc. Perhaps this comment should be revised.
The experiments with conjugated carbonyls show some nice results on a more complex functional
group. The authors claim that these show that imination is faster than conjugate addition,
although a kinetic explanation for selectivity is not supported by the evidence. The observation
could also be a consequence of a thermodynamic preference for the imine product over the beta-
aminoketone product. Is there any evidence that eliminates thermodynamic control in this case?
If not, then this statement must be modified.
In other CeCl3-mediated transformations carried out in protic media it has been hypothesized
that the Ce may largely serve to enhance the acidity and hydrogen-bonding ability of the
solvents, forming effectively a Bronsted acid catalyst. In these mechanisms there is no direct
interaction between the Ce center and the carbonyl, as proposed in the mechanism shown in
Scheme 1. Can the authors really discount such a mechanism? Is there any direct evidence for a
Ce–O interaction? The authors have considered pH as a significant factor, but have not reported
measurements of the pH of solutions containing the CeCl3 additive. Adding these might provide
some additional insights.
The use of anti/syn terminology should be avoided for discussing geometric isomerism. The
absolute stereodescriptors E/Z are preferred to avoid ambiguity.
Finally, the referencing should be proofread. Some references that appear in the manuscript (e.g.,
ref 26f cited on page 6) do not correspond to any citation in the references section.

Comments to the Author:
This work represents a facile new method for the preparation of oxime ethers from aldehydes
and ketones. Depending on the substrate, this is a reaction that can be quick challenging at times,
especially with ketone substrates. The reported method provide high yields across the board,
often with relatively short reaction times. The high yields obtained with sterically hindered
ketones are especially notable.
Most of the comments provided by Reviewer #1 concern the formatting of the manuscript. While
appreciated, these are issues that can be addressed later or are part of the journal style (three
column reference section). I am ok with the "general information" and "materials" section being
kept in the experimental section. Likewise, I am ok with the spectral information for the known
compounds being kept in the main text. This will keep the reader from having to switch back and
forth between different documents. At the same time, paring down the references a bit is
probably warranted.
Reviewer #1 also seems to suggest that the authors should attempt to prepare some of the
compounds listed in Figure 1 using their method. A more reasonable suggestion would be to
attempt the transformation using an alpha-keto ester, isatin, and a 2-hydroxynaphthalene-1,4-
dione substate. This would give a bit more coverage of the oxime-containing subunits present in
Figure 1.
