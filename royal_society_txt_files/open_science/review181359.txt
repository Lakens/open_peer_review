Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This is a well-written paper and overall, it is a good piece of work with bambuterol and
terbutaline quantification. First derivative synchronous spectrofluoremetric method was applied
to determine bambuterol in presence of its degradation product terbutaline by choosing theses
wavelengths 260 nm and 290nm, respectively. The manuscript is adequate for publication after
major and minor revision.

in quality control laboratories”
Line 21: please replace “In terms og green analysis” with “In terms of
green analysis”

reference list.
11-Please reformate all references according to the reference style
mentioned in the guide for authors
- All the references have been corrected and reformatted by
referring to guide of authors.
12- References number 4 and 14 missing article title
- The required corrections have been made.
13- Reference number 11 missing author’s name
- The reference was revised and missing name was inserted.
14-There are many native fluorophores (NADH, FAD, Vitamins etc.,)
are available in blood and urine. How the authors can differentiate
their drug/degraded drug fluorescence from native fluorophores?
- Actually we didn’t make any investigations on biological
samples. The study was devoted to illustrate the usefulness of
synchronous scanning fluorescence spectroscopy for the
analysis of mixtures of fluorescent compounds. But as both
excitation and emission characteristics are included in the
spectrum by simultaneously scanning excitation and emission
wavelengths thereby holding a constant difference between
them, the selectivity for individual components is considerably
improved. A synchronous spectrum contains more information
than conventional single-excitation or single-emission spectra,
as it depends on both excitation and emission profiles of the
respective fluorescent components. The synchronous
fluorescence spectrum is, in fact, a spectral signature.
For example, if we talk about Riboflavin and NADH, their
excitation and emission is different from those of the
investigated compounds. For Riboflavin <U+03BB>ex/<U+03BB>em=270/525nm,
370/525nm and 450/525nm and two fluorescence areas of
NADH locate at<U+03BB>ex/<U+03BB>em=260/460nm and 350/460nm. Their
delta lambda will vary according to the difference between
exciation and emission. Hence, their synchronous spectra are
expected to be well resolved from both BAM and TEB if they
present in the same matrix.

15- In table 1: LOQ of BAM is 0.0701 and of TEB is 0.168 but not
0.071 and 0.169, respectively.
- LOQ for BAM and TEB has been corrected in table 1.
16-In table 2: please check calculations of mean, standard deviation, T
and F
- The table has been checked and corrected in regards to mean,
standard deviation, T and F.
17-In table 2 and table 4 reference number 5 refer to the method used
for comparison, what is it? Is it the method used for raw material or
method used for dosage form?
- The reference method adopted by British Pharmacopoeia (BP)
was for Bambuterol hydrochloride (pure material) in presence
of its related substances. There is no method in BP for the
dosage forms of BAM or TEB. We use this HPLC method for
both pure form and pharmaceutical preparations as we didn’t
find other suitable method that can determine both drugs
without using mass spectrometry. The only method which
could be applied in the literature is reference No.11, but the
paper is not clear and the points at which they measured BAM
and TEB weren’t mentioned in the manuscript.
18- In figure 4 the selected wave length is 290 nm but the title of
linearity in the data provided mentioning that the wavelength is 285nm
please specify, also the range in the title starting from 0.1 µg/ml but
the data showing that the starting concentration is 0.2 µg/ml so please
correct it. The linearity range is 0.2-4 µg/ml in the data provided but it
was written in the caption of the figure that the concentrations used are
in the range of 0.2-3.2 µg/ml. Please show in the figure the points used
in linearity (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2 and 4 µg/ml).
- The correct wavelength is 290 nm which is written throughout
the manuscript. This error has been corrected, and the linearity
range 0.2-4.0 µg/ml has also been corrected in the provided
data.
- The figure has been corrected to show all data in the linearity.
19- In figure 5: the linearity range is 0.2-6 µg/ml in the data provided
for BAM but it was written in the caption of the figure the
concentrations used are in the range of 0.4-6 µg/ml. Please show in the
figure the points used in linearity (0.2, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 4 and 6 µg/ml).
The line F in this figure represent concentration 6 µg/ml with intensity
equal to 100 according to the linearity in the data provided but this line
in the figure its intensity is about 95, please check it again.
- Our aim was to show the validity of measuring the drug at the
zero crossing point in different increasing concentrations so we
didn’t focus on the specific concentrations taken for
constructing calibration curve but now the figure has been
corrected to show all data in the linearity as required by the
reviewer.
20- In figure 9: concentration of BAM is 5 µg/ml and its intensity
should be 86.481 but in the figure it is about 70please check it
again.
- The required correction has been carried out to figure 9.
21- In figure 10: concentration of BAM is 2 µg/ml and its intensity
should be 45.519 but in the figure it is about 30please check it
again.
- The figure is corrected as required by the reviewer. Another
figure for BAM and TEB 3.2 µg/ml each in presence of their
synthetic mixture is now available in the provided data on
Dryad for more confirmation of the obtained results
Reviewer 2:
1- page 5: Line 25 unit of concentration (mg) is not true.
The unit has been corrected to <U+F06D>g/mL.
2- Page 8 : Line 21 there is a spelling mistake.
- The mistake has been corrected.
3- Table 3: How error% is calculated?
- It is calculated from the equation %error = % RSD/vn
4- Table (4): % Found is better described as recovery %
- It has been corrected as recovery % in table 4 and in all other
tables.
5- Statistical tables: number of samples (n) is not found.
Number of samples has been added in all statistical tables
6- Table (2): Amount found for concentration 1.06 should be
revised. Also means for both methods and S.D. of the proposed
one for BAM need revision.
- There was an error in typing the value. It is 1.60 as provided in
the data on Dryad. All the values have been checked and
corrected as instructed by the reviewer.
7- Table (3): check the RSD% for 0.4 µg/ml of BAM.
- The value of % RSD is 1.34 and it has been corrected in the
table.
