The advent of a variety of modern imaging techniques has facilitated a renewed interest in
comparative neuroanatomy in general, including the field of paleoneurology. However, as the
authors point out, there are difficulties associated with the use of fossil endocasts as proxies for
the true likeness of the brain, especially in some fishes, where the relationship between the size
and morphology of the brain and other neural structures and the surrounding neurocranium can
vary markedly.
In this study the authors have used CT scans of the brain from an Australian lungfish
Neoceratodus as a template to reconstruct the brain of an extinct lungfish Rhinodipterus. The key
to this study, it seems to me, is the assumption that in the Australian lungfish, the brain occupies
a very large proportion of the neurocranium. Indeed, the authors have shown that in their
Neoceratodus specimen, the brain occupies 80% of the neurocranium. The authors then use this
finding as justification for using the Neoceratodus brain to reconstruct the Rhinodipterus brain.
I think that this is an interesting study, and that I would be fantastic to be able to reconstruct the
braisn of extinct animals using methods such as those described in this paper. My concern with
the approach used here is the marked difference in size between the fossil specimen and the
specimen of Neoceratodus used. As the authors mention, the skull length for Rhinodipterus is 52
mm, whereas the skull length for Neoceratodus is just 9 mm. While the authors have previously
found that the brain occupies 80% of the neurocranium in this Neoceratodus specimen, is this
also the case for larger individuals? In many varied groups of fishes (e.g., cartilaginous fishes,
bony fishes and the coelacanth), the brain occupies a much larger proportion of the neurocranium
in smaller individuals compared to larger individuals than in adults (Bone and Moore, 2008.
Biology of Fishes, 3rd ed – see Fig. 11.15; Kotrschal et al, 1998. Rev Fish Biol Fish 8:373-408).
Furthermore, scans of a larger Neoceratodus individual (748 mm SL) available on the Digital Fish
Library website (http://www.digitalfishlibrary.org/library/ViewSpecies.php?id=271#) suggest
to me at least that the brain occupies considerably less than 80% of the neurocranium in this
specimen.
I know that the Australian lungfish is protected and that it can be very difficult to material from
this species. However, I feel that the size discrepancy between the specimens from the extant and
extinct species used in this study is too great, and as such we cannot be sure how well the size
and shape of the brain in Neoceratodus conforms to that of the neurocranium. I hope that the
authors can find a larger Neoceratodus specimen to scan, or find some other way around this
problem.
It may be worth contacting Professor Shaun Collin at the University of Western Australia
(http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/people/shaun.collin) regarding getting access to samples from
larger Neoceratodus specimens.

Clement, Strand, Nysjo, Long, and Ahlberg present a technique that allows for reconstruction of
the brain from fossil endocasts in lungfishes. As the closest relative to the tetrapods, lungfishes
represent a critical point in tetrapod brain evolution and much more work is needed on the brain
in this group of fishes. This study made used of previously published fossil endocasts from an
extinct lungfish and existing data on the brain/endocranial relationship in the extant
Neoceratodus to virtually reconstruct and predict brain morphology in Rhinodipterus. They
evaluate the utility of their brain warping technique, with a future goal of multitaxon
comparisons.
Overall, I found this to be a very well written, successful paper that made use of existing material
and emerging techniques. There are minor concerns with regards to novelty and intraspecific
variability, but I felt the author handled these sources of error well and made these limitations
very clear. I have very minor suggestions and questions that require clarification. Specific
comments and grammatical suggestions shown below.
Comments
Grammar
Pg. 3, line 4: fishes instead of fish
Pg. 3, line 56: Though in quotes, I would still avoid the use of ‘higher’ vertebrates, particularly as
there are a lot of arguments that show speciation of the actinopterygiians rivals that of
sarcopterygiians.
Pg. 7, line 52: I would change the word ‘unknowable’ to ‘currently unknown’
Structure
Pg. 4, line 3: I was a bit confused by the word ‘constrained’ – do the authors mean the
relationship between brain/crania is more evolutionarily constrained in tetrapods, or are they
simply stating the brain is more physically constrained (as in, more tightly packed) than it is in
fishes? If it is simply that the brain is more tightly packed into the crania, I would avoid the word
4
constrained, which has a lot of evolutionary implications and would need to be backed up from
the primary literature.
Pg. 4, line 11-16: I find the variation in endocranial occupancy very interesting, as the authors
suggest the brain occupies more than 80% of the cranial cavity in lungfishes. They provide similar
examples in fishes (ie, sharks and Latimeria) but I wonder if similar data exists for tetrapods?
More of a point of curiosity, but the authors claim that the brain/endocranial relationship is more
similar between lungfishes and tetrapods, so I wonder what proportion of the endocranial cavity
is occupied by the brain in amphibians, birds, and mammals?
Pg. 5, Methods: Was a contrast agent used prior to imaging Neoceratodus?
Pg. 5, Methods: My primary question while reading the methods was concerning the rationale for
choosing Neoceratodus and the comparison of a juvenile extant lungfish to what is purportedly
an adult extant species. There are known ontogenetic shifts in brain morphology in fishes (though
I don’t know of studies that have quantified ontogenetic shifts in the cranium, it can be assumed
there would be some corresponding shifts). However, I was very happy to see the authors
address both of these points in the Discussion. I might suggest a bit of further discussion
regarding known intraspecific variability in the brain in fishes generally, particularly as most
fishes experience lifelong postnatal growth (and lifelong neurogenesis) and ontogenetic shifts in
brain morphology. Although I was satisfied that Neoceratodus does not have major ontogenetic
brain shifts (from the author's earlier papers), this is not necessarily true of all species.
Pg. 6, Results: Is it possible to obtain an estimate of volumes of major brain regions from these
data? It seems this would be a next logical step in ascertaining the ancestral condition for the
lungfish brain morphotype.
Figure: I suggest an additional figure of a basic cladogram showing main phylogenetic
relationships in the early Sarcopterygiians. It would provide some contextual information
regarding where the lungfishes sit in vertebrate evolution, but also the interrelationships within
the group (and where the extinct groups may have been positioned).
Pg. 6, Line 54: “The mesencephalon in Neoceratodus was much smaller than the portion of the
cranial cavity housing it, and in both taxa it could have only been a small region of the brain.” –
I’m not sure you can say it ‘could have only been’ a small region of the brain. It’s possible the
tectal hemispheres filled the cranial space in Rhinodipterus, and this structure later recessed in
extant species, leaving behind the ancestral endocranial space.
Pg. 8, Discussion: My final query is regarding novelty. I do not question the novelty of the
technique used here at all, but as the cranial endocast of Rhinodipterus was previously published,
as is the spatial relationship between brain and endocranial cavity in Neoceratodus, this study
represents a smaller step forward in the field. If the authors are able to gather volumetric
information on major brain regions in Rhinodipterus, that would be a much more significant
advance. Nevertheless, I do find it to be an important step in comparative neuroscience, as
enabling a methodology that allows for brain reconstruction from lungfish fossils is critical to our
understanding of early tetrapod brain evolution.
Overall, I greatly enjoyed this paper and, with minor corrections, find it very suitable for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.

Dear Dr Clement:
I write you in regards to manuscript RSOS-160082 entitled "Let’s Do The Brain Warp Again:
Applying The Brain-Neurocranial Spatial Relationship In An Extant Lungfish To A Fossil
Endocast" which you submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
In view of the criticisms of the reviewers and editors, found at the bottom of this letter, your
manuscript has been rejected for publication.
Thank you for considering Royal Society Open Science for the publication of your research. I
hope this decision will not discourage you from submitting manuscripts in the future.
Yours sincerely,

Editor Comments to Author (Professor Kevin Padian):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
I have to admit that it is difficult to see why this paper is a substantial advance. As the reviewers
point out, the cranial anatomy of the Devonian sarcopterygian was already published. It is
laudable to compare it to a living sarcopterygian, and too bad that the only available one is a tiny
juvenile (about 10% of the average size of the species and 7.5% of the largest individuals).
However, merely pointing out similarities does not produce interesting results.
Moreover, this is a two-taxon comparison, which is of no interest in comparative biology (see for
example Eldredge & Cracraft 1980: Phylogenetic Patterns and the Evolutionary Process; Brooks
and McLennan 1991: Phylogeny, Ecology, and Behavior). Two-taxon comparisons cannot yield
information about symplesiomorphies and synapomorphies.
I wish to point out that the use of the term “fish” in this manuscript is indicative of the lack of
understanding of comparative biology. If you call anything that swims a “fish,” you are
characterizing it by plesiomorphies. Likewise, simply to compare superficially the anatomies of
two brain endocasts is to discuss plesiomorphies. This is why there is no real insight in this
paper.
The term “fish,” when used colloquially, should be restricted to actinopterygians, as many
authors have pointed out. It is no longer useful or informative to do otherwise. Your term is
“sarcopterygians” when you do not mean specifically “lungfishes + tetrapods.” Please adjust.
You assert that ontogenetic changes in the braincase of sarcopterygians are insignificant enough
6
to validate your comparison between a fossil (adult? Who knows?) specimen and an extant
specimen that is 7-10% adult size. I find this difficult to accept without a lot of evidence.
In the discussion the authors appear to suggest that if one could triangulate among crown-group
and total-group “templates,” the correct morphology of Rhinodipterus could be derived. This is a
fallacy. Please read Darwin (1859) for a justification why the common ancestor of two taxa need
not in any way embody an intermediate morphology between its descendants.
This paper could evince more interest if the differences in cranial features were interpreted
functionally (and developmentally, given the immature state of your Neoceratodus).
It is difficult to see what the illustrations are actually trying to communicate.
I am sorry but I don’t think this is enough of a contribution to be publishable. And to be taken
seriously it would be good to lose the cute title and provide something serious and informative
that describes the work.

Subject Editor Comments to Author:
The authors have answered most of the comments of the reviewers to their satisfaction, and mine
as well. The title is greatly improved, and I think will raise the interest level of the paper. The
authors qualify much better the potential difficulty with comparing the very small living lungfish
specimen to the Devonian one. They stress that the paper is about imaging, and so I think answer
the concern that one of the reviewers and an associate editor had about the novelty of the results.
Still problematic, in my view, is the use of the term “fish,” but the authors clarify this somewhat
in the introduction. By their usage, which is admittedly not uncommon among paleontologists
who work on non-tetrapods, “fish” is often used for all those groups (e.g., Neil Shubin’s Your
Inner Fish). Among osteichthyans, as they point out, sarcopterygians and actinopterygians are
quite different. This probably explains the second sentence of their abstract. It is parallel to the
use of the term “reptile” in the now-obsolete term “mammal-like reptile.”
So I am happy to have this paper go forward. But I should clarify that as Subject Editor for
Biology (not Associate Editor, sorry that is not clear on the website), I have to balance comments
from reviewers and associate editors, who sometimes communicate issues privately that they do
not transmit to the authors, and whose ratings sometimes do not correspond to the severity (one
way or another) of their comments, balanced across the board of the dozens of manuscripts in
various subjects that are handled each month. Authors, understandably, do not see all this, and
reviewers must call things as they see them. The occasional misunderstanding or confusion is of
course regrettable.
Congratulations on the acceptance of the paper, and I look forward to its publication.

Manuscript ID RSOS-160082
Resubmission
To Matt Allinson, Editorial Coordinator,
We appreciate the opportunity to resubmit our manuscript ID RSOS-160082 for consideration in
Royal Society Open Science.
This paper is not a two-taxon comparison, nor an attempt to identify symplesiomorphies in the
lungfish brain. We instead outline a novel methodology for virtually reconstructing gross brain
morphology in fossil taxa for which a cranial endocast is known. Through the application of X-ray
microtomography and 3D rendering software we can take the brain-neurocranial relationship in an
extant taxon (in this case, the Australian lungfish) and apply it to fossil taxa (in this case, the Late
Devonian lungfish Rhinodipterus kimberleyensis).
Using morphological landmarks and elastic deformation we can register the two datasets and ‘warp’
one to another. We then use our own ‘distance map’ software tool to both analyse and present the
data. While we present a reconstruction of the brain in a fossil taxon, the main purpose of the
project is the presentation of our new technique. We envisage that our method will have particular
significance for palaeoneurologists studying cranial endocasts across a wide range of taxa.
We hereby certify that none of the submitted material (nor portions thereof) have been previously
published or are under consideration for publication elsewhere. However, we have had prior
interaction with The Royal Society regarding this manuscript (please refer to manuscript ID RSOS-
160082). Please find our specific responses to the Associate Editor and two reviewers’ comments on
the following pages. Many of the comments were general in nature, but for the specific ones we

Comments to the Author:
I have to admit that it is difficult to see why this paper is a substantial advance. As the reviewers
point out, the cranial anatomy of the Devonian sarcopterygian was already published. It is laudable
to compare it to a living sarcopterygian, and too bad that the only available one is a tiny juvenile
(about 10% of the average size of the species and 7.5% of the largest individuals). However, merely
pointing out similarities does not produce interesting results.
Authors’ comment:
Unfortunately, we feel the Associate Editor may not have grasped the purpose of the
manuscript, as at no point do we simply “point out similarities” as results. The main aim of
the manuscript is to present a novel methodology developed to reconstruct the brain of a
Devonian lungfish, calculated using data from the extant Australian lungfish.
We are well aware of the size difference between our specimens, and discuss this issue, and
how ontogeny may influence our results in the Discussion section (see pages 7-9). We must
stress that the focus of the manuscript is broad and centres around a new technique
intended for use across the palaeoneurological community, not necessarily only concerning
the specific taxon used as an example.
Moreover, this is a two-taxon comparison, which is of no interest in comparative biology (see for
example Eldredge & Cracraft 1980: Phylogenetic Patterns and the Evolutionary Process; Brooks and
McLennan 1991: Phylogeny, Ecology, and Behavior). Two-taxon comparisons cannot yield
information about symplesiomorphies and synapomorphies.
Authors’ Comment: This paper is not a two-taxon comparison. The point of the new paper is
providing a new methodological approach for restoring endocasts of fossil organisms. For
the first time we use tomographic data from two taxa, and make the most accurate
restoration of early dipnoan brain morphology yet determined.
Furthermore, palaeontology has moved on enormously since Eldredge & Cracraft 1980 (35
years ago) and even Brooks and McLennan 1991 (15 years ago). Besides, the point of this
paper is not “phylogenetics” where two taxon comparisons are indeed not useful for
determining synapomorphies. Again, we feel this criticism implies that the manuscript was
not fully understood.
I wish to point out that the use of the term “fish” in this manuscript is indicative of the lack of
understanding of comparative biology. If you call anything that swims a “fish,” you are characterizing
it by plesiomorphies. Likewise, simply to compare superficially the anatomies of two brain endocasts
is to discuss plesiomorphies. This is why there is no real insight in this paper.
The term “fish,” when used colloquially, should be restricted to actinopterygians, as many authors
have pointed out. It is no longer useful or informative to do otherwise. Your term is
“sarcopterygians” when you do not mean specifically “lungfishes + tetrapods.” Please adjust.
Authors’ Comment: all of us, but especially Long and Ahlberg with their thirty years of
research experience on early vertebrates, know the definition of ‘fish’ and have never used
the simplistic definition suggested by the Associate Editor that a fish is “anything that
swims”! We more than anyone are aware of the paraphyly of the term ‘fish’ but use it as it is
published still uses the term fish even when describing ancient basal forms that are non-
actinopterygian or non-osteichthyan (e.g. Gai et al., Nature 2011 “A Fossil Jawless Fish From
China Foreshadows Early Jawed vertebrate Anatomy”). That the word ‘fish’ should be used
only for actinopterygians is the opinion of the Associate Editor, however it is not the norm as
seen from widespread use of the term in palaeontology.
Again we must stress that this paper is not about phylogenetics, but about a new method for
determining accurate brain-endocast relationships. We are therefore perplexed that the
Associate Editor raises queries concerning symplesiomorphies in the brain. This person has
clearly not understood the main points of the paper that the two expert reviewers did.
You assert that ontogenetic changes in the braincase of sarcopterygians are insignificant enough to
validate your comparison between a fossil (adult? Who knows?) specimen and an extant specimen
that is 7-10% adult size. I find this difficult to accept without a lot of evidence.
Authors’ comments: We very clearly acknowledge the size disparity between the two
specimens in the Methods section, and clearly raise this point again in the Discussion. Again,
this paper does not contain a comparison between taxa, instead it describes a new analytical
method developed to reconstruct brain morphology from fossil endocasts.
As we discuss in the paper, we understand there well may be significant differences in the
brain-endocranial relationship in lungfish through ontogeny, and we agree that differences
in size and ontogeny have a strong bearing on the interpretation of results. Of course the
inferences one may draw must take ontogeny into account when interpreting the results.
We do not claim to have definitively and perfectly reconstructed the brain of Rhinodipterus,
we instead present a new method from which to reconstruct using the data available to
researchers.
In the discussion the authors appear to suggest that if one could triangulate among crown-group and
total-group “templates,” the correct morphology of Rhinodipterus could be derived. This is a fallacy.
Please read Darwin (1859) for a justification why the common ancestor of two taxa need not in any
way embody an intermediate morphology between its descendants.
Authors’ comments: We find this to be another bizarre comment, as we simply outline in the
Discussion the problems associated with phylogenetic bracketing as applied to this particular
question. However we do believe that in the future as more taxa are studied and have this
method applied, we will likely be able to reconstruct gross brain morphology with greater
accuracy.
This paper could evince more interest if the differences in cranial features were interpreted
functionally (and developmentally, given the immature state of your Neoceratodus).
Authors’ comments: Again, we must stress that this paper was not a comparison of two taxa.
We developed a new method using our tomographic data from two taxa to warp 3D spatial
relationships using landmark data and elastic deformation. We then go on to use our
‘distance map’ software tool to analyse and present the data. A discussion concerning
functional morphology and inferred behavioural abilities in the dipnoan brain has already
been presented in previous papers by the same authors (Clement & Ahlberg 2014 PlosOne;
Clement et al. 2015 PlosOne) that were both clearly referenced in the current manuscript.
It is difficult to see what the illustrations are actually trying to communicate.
Authors’ comments: We believe the figure captions to be clear and concise. The original
Figure 1 illustrates the methodology used, and Figure 2 illustrates the brain-endocranial
cavity relationship as reconstructed for Rhinodipterus (a-c, distance between surfaces ‘heat
map’, d-f, the overlay relationship between brain and endocast, and g-I, the brain as
reconstructed for Rhinodipterus in this analysis). Again we feel by this comment that the
Associate Editor has misinterpreted the aims and methodology of this paper.
I am sorry but I don’t think this is enough of a contribution to be publishable. And to be taken
seriously it would be good to lose the cute title and provide something serious and informative that
describes the work.
Authors’ response: Concerning our original submission, we were amazed that the Royal
Society would allow an Associate Editor to overturn two perfectly good reviewer responses,
who both appeared to suggest the paper be accepted with minor corrections. Most
worryingly in this instance however, it seems the Associate Editor did not understand the
manuscript at all.
We had thought that the ‘cute’ title (i.e. memorable) would aid in raising the public profile of
Royal Society Open Science and help to raise greater media interest in the story. Such a title
in conjunction with the novel methods developed could have ensured widespread media
focus on the work. However, following on from this criticism we have updated the title to “A
New Methodological Approach for Reconstructing Brain Morphology: Applying The Brain-
Neurocranial Spatial Relationship In An Extant Lungfish To A Fossil Endocast” to prevent any
further misinterpretation (page 1, lines 1-4).

Comments to the Author(s)
The advent of a variety of modern imaging techniques has facilitated a renewed interest in
comparative neuroanatomy in general, including the field of paleoneurology.
However, as the authors point out, there are difficulties associated with the use of fossil endocasts
as proxies for the true likeness of the brain, especially in some fishes, where the relationship
between the size and morphology of the brain and other neural structures and the surrounding
neurocranium can vary markedly. In this study the authors have used CT scans of the brain from an
Australian lungfish Neoceratodus as a template to reconstruct the brain of an extinct lungfish
Rhinodipterus. The key to this study, it seems to me, is the assumption that in the
Australian lungfish, the brain occupies a very large proportion of the neurocranium.
Indeed, the authors have shown that in their Neoceratodus specimen, the brain occupies 80% of the
neurocranium. The authors then use this finding as justification for using the Neoceratodus brain to
reconstruct the Rhinodipterus brain.
I think that this is an interesting study, and that I would be fantastic to be able to reconstruct the
brains of extinct animals using methods such as those described in this paper. My concern with the
approach used here is the marked difference in size between the fossil specimen and the specimen
of Neoceratodus used. As the authors mention, the skull length for Rhinodipterus is 52 mm, whereas
the skull length for Neoceratodus is just 9 mm. While the authors have previously found that the
brain occupies 80% of the neurocranium in this Neoceratodus specimen, is this also the case for
larger individuals? In many varied groups of fishes (e.g., cartilaginous fishes, bony fishes and the
coelacanth), the brain occupies a much larger proportion of the neurocranium in smaller individuals
compared to larger individuals than in adults (Bone and Moore, 2008. Biology of Fishes, 3rd ed – see
Fig. 11.15; Kotrschal et al, 1998. Rev Fish Biol Fish 8:373-408). Furthermore, scans of a larger
Neoceratodus individual (748 mm SL) available on the Digital Fish Library website
(http://www.digitalfishlibrary.org/library/ViewSpecies.php?id=271#) suggest to me at least that the
brain occupies considerably less than 80% of the neurocranium in this specimen.
Authors’ Comment: Firstly, the comment that the assumption that the brain in Neoceratodus
occupies a very large proportion of the neurocranium is the key to this study not entirely
correct. We used the brain-endocranial relationship in Neoceratodus to reconstruct the
brain in Rhinodipterus as it is the closest living relative available. Whether the brain filled
much or little of the endocast is actually irrelevant for the methodology used. One may
indeed use a taxon with a large discrepancy in brain to endocast size and still apply our
technique. We are very clear stating that the brain reconstructed is done so using the
assumption that it has the same spatial relationship as the extant representative used.
We agree that there are size and ratio differences between adults and juvenile specimens,
but we believe we have dealt with these issues accordingly in the Discussion section (pages
7-9). Of course the brain in the juvenile Neoceratodus is in all likelihood different to what
actually existed inside the endocast of Rhinodipterus 385 million years ago, but we believe
we clearly identify these assumptions in the manuscript. What we have presented is a
method to reconstruct the gross morphology of the brain in a fossil taxon, with the
assumption that it has the same spatial proportions as the extant taxon used. In the absence
of discovering an actual fossilised brain, we instead use the data available to us to quantify
and qualify this relationship as best we can.
larger adult specimen more similar in scale to Rhinodipterus, we specifically wish to illustrate
the diffuse iodine computed tomography component of our methodology used in this paper.
The iodine is used as a contrasting agent to produce greater differentiation of soft tissues
prior to CT scanning.
I know that the Australian lungfish is protected and that it can be very difficult to material from this
species. However, I feel that the size discrepancy between the specimens from the extant and
extinct species used in this study is too great, and as such we cannot be sure how well the size and
shape of the brain in Neoceratodus conforms to that of the neurocranium. I hope that the authors
can find a larger Neoceratodus specimen to scan, or find some other way around this problem.
It may be worth contacting Professor Shaun Collin at the University of Western Australia
(http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/people/shaun.collin) regarding getting access to samples from larger
Neoceratodus specimens.
Authors’ Comment: We agree that the brain-endocranial space changes throughout
ontogeny, and that in an adult Neoceratodus the brain does not fill the endocast as much as
in younger individuals. It is a hope of the author’s that they will be able to source adult
Neoceratodus specimens in the future for an analysis of changes through ontogeny with
respect to the brain-endocranial spatial relationship, however this material is incredibly
difficult to source and is at this time outside the scope of the present study. Besides, the
purpose of the manuscript is to demonstrate the technique with which to reconstruct the
brain in a fossil taxon. Determining the most appropriate specimens to use to do so, and the
inferences drawn from these, will be the responsibility of future users of the technique.
Thank you for the suggestion of contacting Professor Shaun Collin in regards to potentially
sourcing additional material for future studies.

Comments to the Author(s)
Clement, Strand, Nysjo, Long, and Ahlberg present a technique that allows for reconstruction of the
brain from fossil endocasts in lungfishes. As the closest relative to the tetrapods, lungfishes
represent a critical point in tetrapod brain evolution and much more work is needed on the brain in
this group of fishes. This study made used of previously published fossil endocasts from an extinct
lungfish and existing data on the brain/endocranial relationship in the extant Neoceratodus to
virtually reconstruct and predict brain morphology in Rhinodipterus. They evaluate the utility of their
brain warping technique, with a future goal of multitaxon comparisons.
Overall, I found this to be a very well written, successful paper that made use of existing material
and emerging techniques. There are minor concerns with regards to novelty and intraspecific
variability, but I felt the author handled these sources of error well and made these limitations very
clear. I have very minor suggestions and questions that require clarification. Specific comments and
grammatical suggestions shown below.
Comments
Grammar
Pg. 3, line 4: fishes instead of fish
Authors’ Comment: amended (page. 3, line 63)
Pg. 3, line 56: Though in quotes, I would still avoid the use of ‘higher’ vertebrates, particularly as
there are a lot of arguments that show speciation of the actinopterygians rivals that of
sarcopterygians.
Authors’ Comment: we have removed the word ‘higher’ (page 3, line 94)
Pg. 7, line 52: I would change the word ‘unknowable’ to ‘currently unknown’
Authors’ Comment: we have replaced ‘unknowable’ with ‘unknown’ (page 7, line 229)
Structure
Pg. 4, line 3: I was a bit confused by the word ‘constrained’ – do the authors mean the relationship
between brain/crania is more evolutionarily constrained in tetrapods, or are they simply stating the
brain is more physically constrained (as in, more tightly packed) than it is in fishes? If it is simply that
the brain is more tightly packed into the crania, I would avoid the word constrained, which has a lot
of evolutionary implications and would need to be backed up from the primary literature.
Authors’ Comment: We meant that is was more physically constrained. We have since
replaced the text as ‘thought to be a better ‘fit’ and more tightly packed than those in fishes’
to clarify this (pages 3,4, lines 95-97)
Pg. 4, line 11-16: I find the variation in endocranial occupancy very interesting, as the authors
suggest the brain occupies more than 80% of the cranial cavity in lungfishes.
for tetrapods? More of a point of curiosity, but the authors claim that the brain/endocranial
relationship is more similar between lungfishes and tetrapods, so I wonder what proportion of the
endocranial cavity is occupied by the brain in amphibians, birds, and mammals?
Authors’ Comment: The references given in the Introduction (Rowe et al 2011 for mammals,
Witmer et al. 2008 for birds, crocodiles and nonavian dinosaurs, and Romer and Edinger
1942 for salamanders, frogs and fossil amphibians) are intended to illustrate the point that
there is often a close spatial relationship between the brain and endocast in these specific
groups listed. To clarify this further, the paragraph has been amended as follows “Generally,
the brain-neurocranial relationships in vertebrate taxa such as mammals (27) or reptiles and
birds (28) are thought to be ‘a better fit’ and more tightly packed in contrast to those in
fishes. Indeed, the physical growth of the brain in amphibians and reptiles is “a factor in
molding the skull” and their endocasts closely “reproduce many brain features” ((29), page
368-9). In fishes on the other hand…” We believe that further work is required to accurately
quantify brain-endocranial volumes across key vertebrate taxa rather than provide general
estimates for the amphibian, bird and mammal groups as a whole.
Pg. 5, Methods: Was a contrast agent used prior to imaging Neoceratodus?
Authors’ Comment: Yes, iodine was used as the contrasting agent. This had already been
mentioned in the methods section (page 5, line 139) “was immersed in 2% ethanolic iodine
for six weeks in order to enhance differential soft tissue contrast”, however we have now
also inserted “as a contrasting agent” here to make this clearer.
We also inserted the text “iodine treated” under the Tomographic methods section (page 5,
line 151) to reiterate that the specimen had been treated with a contrasting agent prior to
scanning.
Pg. 5, Methods: My primary question while reading the methods was concerning the rationale for
choosing Neoceratodus and the comparison of a juvenile extant lungfish to what is purportedly an
adult extant species. There are known ontogenetic shifts in brain morphology in fishes (though I
don’t know of studies that have quantified ontogenetic shifts in the cranium, it can be assumed
there would be some corresponding shifts).
However, I was very happy to see the authors address both of these points in the
Discussion. I might suggest a bit of further discussion regarding known intraspecific variability in the
brain in fishes generally, particularly as most fishes experience lifelong postnatal growth (and
lifelong neurogenesis) and ontogenetic shifts in brain morphology. Although I was satisfied that
Neoceratodus does not have major ontogenetic brain shifts (from the author's earlier papers), this is
not necessarily true of all species.
Authors’ Comment: We fully understand that there are ontogenetic shifts in brain
morphology in fishes, and that most often there will be smaller increases in brain size
compared to overall size increase. We believe we address these concerns (in previous
responses), but also in the Discussion section. Neoceratodus was chosen as the extant
representative as it is considered the closest living relative to Rhinodipterus.
We have included the following paragraph in the Discussion section to further address the
points raised by the reviewer “Indeed, we are well aware that brains scale allometrically
(negatively) with body size. We must stress that far from reconstructing the brain
morphology of Rhinodipterus flawlessly, this paper instead presents a methodology with
information from the closest extant species. With respect to lungfish, much further work is
required to quantify ontogenetic changes in the extant taxa (43), and establish how we can
interpret variability in brain morphology (whether this be due to evolutionary history,
ontogeny, individual variation or behavioural parameters) when applying this methodology
to fossil species.”
Pg. 6, Results: Is it possible to obtain an estimate of volumes of major brain regions from these data?
It seems this would be a next logical step in ascertaining the ancestral condition for the lungfish
brain morphotype.
Authors’ Comment: This would require an additional analysis and to completely revise the
method used for the image registration as the registration was optimised to match the
whole volumes. Significant further work would be required to calculate each of the brain
regions separately. Although this is a good suggestion for future work, it is currently beyond
the scope of this project.
Figure: I suggest an additional figure of a basic cladogram showing main phylogenetic relationships
in the early Sarcopterygians. It would provide some contextual information regarding where the
lungfishes sit in vertebrate evolution, but also the interrelationships within the group (and where the
extinct groups may have been positioned).
Authors’ Comment: thank you for this suggestion. We have now included an additional
figure (see Figure 1) containing the main phylogenetic relationships of early sarcopterygians.
Pg. 6, Line 54: “The mesencephalon in Neoceratodus was much smaller than the portion of the
cranial cavity housing it, and in both taxa it could have only been a small region of the brain.” – I’m
not sure you can say it ‘could have only been’ a small region of the brain. It’s possible the tectal
hemispheres filled the cranial space in Rhinodipterus, and this structure later recessed in extant
species, leaving behind the ancestral endocranial space.
Authors’ Comment: We have now updated the text to read “was much smaller than the
portion of the cranial cavity housing it, and is consequently the smallest brain region”
Pg. 8, Discussion: My final query is regarding novelty. I do not question the novelty of the technique
used here at all, but as the cranial endocast of Rhinodipterus was previously published, as is the
spatial relationship between brain and endocranial cavity in Neoceratodus, this study represents a
smaller step forward in the field. If the authors are able to gather volumetric information on major
brain regions in Rhinodipterus, that would be a much more significant advance. Nevertheless, I do
find it to be an important step in comparative neuroscience, as enabling a methodology that allows
for brain reconstruction from lungfish fossils is critical to our understanding of early tetrapod brain
evolution. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this paper and, with minor corrections, find it very suitable for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Authors’ Comment: We are not exactly sure what the Reviewer is suggesting here. Is it the
relative brain volume regions of the fossil endocast, the reconstructed brain of
Rhinodipterus or the condition in the living Neoceratodus that would provide the advance?
reconstructed Rhinodipterus brain (relative to the endocast) would require much additional
analysis and to completely revise the method used for the image registration. It would be
feasible to calculate the relative volume areas of the original endocast, however we fail to
appreciate how this would significantly improve the current paper (although it is a useful
suggestion for future work). And a more detailed examination of the brain-endocast
relationship in all extant lungfishes, (including Neoceratodus) is currently underway with
other co-authors.
