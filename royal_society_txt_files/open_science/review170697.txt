1. The language of the manuscript is not accepted, there are too many grammatical errors.
In page 3 line 9, “separation of adsorption” what does it mean?
In page 3 line 19 “when calcined them to burn off the adsorbed dyes” it is not a sentence.
In page 11 line 4 “complex” it is a noun not a verb.
In page 2 line 49, “lead” should be “lead to”
In page 2 line 57, “calcium carbonate is low-cost and abundant in nature” the sentence has
grammatical error.
2. Hesp plays an important role in the preparation of CaCO3. After the formation of
CaCO3, how to remove Hesp? If Hesp still exist in CaCO3, it can or cannot influence the
adsorption performance of CaCO3?
3. After the recycling experiment, how about the structure of CaCO3? SEM images and BET
data should be given.
4. The recycling experiment was carried out for 5 times, how about more times?
5. Table 1 shows a comparison of performance for different adsorbents, but the
performance of CaCO3 with different structure in references was not shown. The relevant
references about CaCO3 should be added.
6. In the discussion of the different adsorption capacity of CaCO3 for different dyes, does
steric effect need to be considered?

Reviewer 1
Q1:The language of the manuscript is not accepted, there are too many grammatical
errors.
Answer:We have carefully revised the grammatical errors in the revised manuscript
Q2:Hesp plays an important role in the preparation of CaCO3. After the formation of
CaCO3, how to remove Hesp? If Hesp still exist in CaCO3, it can or cannot influence
the adsorption performance of CaCO3?
Answer: The prepared CaCO3 MSs were rinsed thoroughly. However, Hesp was still
found in the obtained CaCO3 MSs. We used thermogravimetric analysis to determine
the content of Hesp in the obtained core-shell structured CaCO3 MSs.Result in Fig.S2
confirms that the content of Hesp in CaCO3 MSs is less than 1 weight %. Therfore,
the influence of Hesp on the adsorption performance of CaCO3 might be negligible.
Q3:After the recycling experiment, how about the structure of CaCO3? SEM images
and BET data should be given.
Answer: In the revised manuscript, we have added the SEM image (Fig. S3) and BET
data (Fig. S4) of these CaCO3 MSs which have been used for 5 recycling
experiments. It is clear that these CaCO3 MSs maintain their original structure well
after 5 recycling experiment, indicating the obtained core-shell CaCO3 MSs are
stable in the recycling experiments. Fig. S4 shows that BET surface area of CaCO3
MSs after 5 cycles have no obvious change.
Q4:The recycling experiment was carried out for 5 times, how about more times?
Answer: According to the reviewer’s comments, we have done the supplementery
experiment on the recycling experiment, and shown the results (Fig. S5) for 6-10th
cycle (adsorption-desorption) in the revised manuscript. It was found that the removal
efficiency has littlely declined to 93.86 % of CBB, 95.63 % of CR and 92.40 % of AB
after 10th cycle. This suggests that the obtained CaCO3 MSs are stable in the
recycling experiments and main the high removal efficiency for dyes.
Q5: Table 1 shows a comparison of performance for different adsorbents, but the
performance of CaCO3 with different structure in references was not shown. The
relevant references about CaCO3 should be added.
Answer: We have added the reported performance of CaCO3 in Table 1 in the revised
manuscript.
Q6: In the discussion of the different adsorption capacity of CaCO3 for different dyes,
does steric effect need to be considered?
Answer: Steric effect does affect the dye adsorption behavior of CaCO3 MSs. In the
adsorption of AB, it has more tertiary ammonium groups than quaternary ammonium
groups. Thus, CaCO3 MSs can efficiently adsorb AB molecules due to tertiary
ammonium groups. The adsorption time is quite long (28h) because of the exclusion
between quaternary ammonium groups and Ca2+ ions. Also, its bigger molecular size
will lead to steric effect which may obstruct the adsorption. We have addressed this in
the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 2
Q1:Abstract, should contain some important quantitative findings.
Introduction, first paragraph, need to put these references:
Carbohydrate polymers 113, 115-130 (2014).
Journal of hazardous materials 177 (1), 70-80 (2010).
Answer: We greatly thank the reviewer for pointing out these issues. We have added
some important quantitative findings in abstract and put the references in introduction
part of the revised manuscript.
