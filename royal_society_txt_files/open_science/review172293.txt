This paper is ground breaking and rich with new information about tooth development that has
strong bearing on the evolution in growth rates and physiology associated with the evolutionary
origins of mammals. The microscopic structure of the mineralized tissues of tooth (enamel and
dentine) has a physical relationship to cellular and tissue-level processes during dental
developmental. Thus the study of these microscopic structures can be used to infer rates of
dental development and other physiological properties. Tooth microstructure has been well
studied in living mammal groups as well as in many fossil members of the mammalian crown
group. However, our knowledge of tooth microstructure outside crown-group mammals is
spotty. This paper looks at the evolution of tooth microstructure in a series of fossil taxa that
bracket the origin of mammals. It is important both because it empirically documents the pattern
of microstructure in these extinct taxa and because it uses those patterns to evaluate what we
know about the evolution of skeletal growth, tooth replacement patterns, and their physiological
context.
I am strongly positive about the paper. The writing is very clear, the figures are fabulous, and the
text should be accessible to all scientific readers, regardless of whether they were previously
familiar with tooth microstructure or not.
I only have three comments:
3
1. Abstract: In contrast with the rest of the paper, the abstract is unlikely to be accessible to non-
specialists. I suggest switching the abstract with the final Summary, because the latter makes all
the same points in non-technical language.
2. Body mass correction (p. 9). In principle, the body mass regressions should be done using
phylogenetic correction in order to estimate the body mass-to-DSR –CER relationships. This
produces an estimate of the relationship between the variables that is unbiased by phylogenetic
similarity and thus maximizes the contribution of the underlying developmental relationship
between the two. You could make such a correction using either a regression of phylogenetically
independent contrasts or the PGLS method of Martins and Hansen (1997). A wide range of
software is available to do this, including the R statistical package. You can use the resulting
regression coefficients for the size correction steps on p. 10.
3. Figure 4: It would be useful to rearrange the parts in phylogenetic order (A Diademodon, B
Massetognathus, C. Irajatherium, D. Oligokyphus, E. Morganucodon). It would also be useful to
provide high-resolution versions of these and micrographs in the supplemental files.

This manuscript describes the first comprehensive measurements of diapsid-to-mammal
transitions in enamel periodicity. The data look very good, the analyses and interpretations are
justified by the data, and clearly explained. The manuscript is very well written, but could easily
be edited to be much shorter, both in terms of the topics introduced (and the amount of detail
4
given) and also in making Methods and Results sections more succinct without extraneous
discussion of points that should probably either be introduced in the Introduction or left to the
Discussion to discuss. However, I see that it gives nice, clear definitions of all concepts and so is
easy to read for someone new to the field, and so this is an argument to keep some of that text.
I have only minor suggestions or corrections to make:
Please be more specific in your figure references to parts within figures – if a first point refers to
A, then reference Figure 7A, and the second is pointing to B, then reference Figure 7B.
P5L10: change ‘one-on-one’ to ‘one-to-one’.
P5L47: change to “Tomes’ process”.
P7L50: add closing parenthesis.
P8L48: Length y does not exactly represent increase in crown height; crown height would
normally be measured perpendicular to the base of the tooth, and length y will run at an angle to
this vertical distance. It does represent the absolute length of extension of the EDJ, and so that is
how it should be described. (Similarly, Figure 3 caption.)
P12L27: I do not think the statistical analysis using individual tooth values is necessary, or
particularly valid, and would be worth leaving out of the manuscript as the results are
apparently essentially the same.
P12L45: The statistical tests using 1-day long-period periodicity rather than 2-day will of course
give the same results if all of these taxa have the same periodicity, and so are not a valuable
addition to the manuscript. Given your conclusions later about equivalency of periodicity in
enamel and dentine it is not necessary to give additional detail/discussion on the 1-day enamel
periodicity.
P12L55: isolated closing parenthesis.
P35L44: add ‘(green)’ when first referring to striae of Retzius.
Figure 3: what are the 3 lines on top left of figure that meet the outer enamel surface? If they are
intended to be indicative of cementum layers then you should give them a different colour or
omit them.
Figure 4: I’m not sure that A has to be twice the size of B-E; it could be cropped to the lower right
corner where incremental lines are clear, or the top half could also be cropped as the lines are not
very clear there. Also, it would be worth mirroring A and E to have cervix direction consistent
among figures. What does ‘soft focus’ in C mean? Does this mean out of focus so that both lines
are equally visible, but still somewhat out of focus because the two lines are not in the same plane
of focus?
Figure 5: it would be useful to indicate equivalent enamel incremental lines on this figure to show
more clearly the relationship to dentine incremental lines, i.e. do the same number of enamel and
dentine increments start at the EDJ over the same length? From the similarity in crown extension
rates it seems clear that they will line up nicely.
Figure 7: It would be worth drawing over some of the incremental lines and the EDJ and showing
the angle between them to more clearly illustrate your point, although I realise that the
incremental lines marked in B do not meet the EDJ in this image, and so perhaps a different part
of the tooth would be better.

Please accept my apologies for the time it has taken to get all the reviews for your paper returned.
All three reviewers propose accepting with minor revisions and two of the three have waived
anonymity. I am not sure what to make of the first comment in the attached PDF.... I hope you
will understand it.
In addition to their comments, and commending you for your excellent figures, I have one minor
textural query

are orientated obliquely from the crystallites of the prisms.

Dear Professors Collins and Padian,
Thank you for the opportunity to address the reviewers’ comments on our manuscript “Enamel
formation and growth in non-mammalian cynodonts”. We would firstly like to thank all three reviewers
for the time, care and attention they have paid to this review. All have provided a set of comments that
have improved the methodology, clarity and accuracy of the study, and we are very grateful for their

Altered to ‘oriented’ as suggested.

A well researched and executed paper.
P4 L17. Ameloblasts are displaced by their own secretions, and thus do not move per se, but are moved.
We have changed the wording of page 4, lines 9-11 to reflect this distinction.
P4 L16. This direction very much depends upon the shape of the Tomes process. Crystallite discontinuities
of keyhole prism morphologies are, for instance, common in primates.
We have left this sentence (page 4, lines 16-19) as is because we have not yet introduced the Tomes’
process.
P4 L17. This mythology perpetrated in the literature is not correct for all prism morphologies. The
keyhole pattern just mentioned is the product of a minimum of 3 cells. The statement would be true by
saying, "Each prism head, is..."
The sentence (from page 4, line 19) now reads “Each prism head…” as suggested.
P6 L11. Did I really use this term? Hypothalamic mediation most likely, by some neruendocrine
mechanism maybe, possibly using the SCN toolbox to manifest itself.
This terminology has been altered as suggested. The sentence beginning page 6, line 16) now reads “A
recent hypothesis suggests that they are the expression of a biorhythm underlying growth and bone
formation in mammals, mediated by the hypothalamus through a neuroendocrine mechanism.”
P7 L40. How was it that they were hydrated to begin with?
This sentence (page 8, lines 4-5) now reads “Specimens marked for sectioning were transferred
through graded concentrations of alcohol into acetone in order to ensure dehydration” to clarify this
question.
P8 L17. Linear or circular?
Linear. Corrected in manuscript (page 8, line 24).

This paper makes a major contribution that has broad implications. It is also very well written in such a
way that it will be accessible to a broad audience.
This paper is ground breaking and rich with new information about tooth development that has strong
bearing on the evolution in growth rates and physiology associated with the evolutionary origins of
mammals. The microscopic structure of the mineralized tissues of tooth (enamel and dentine) has a
physical relationship to cellular and tissue-level processes during dental developmental. Thus the study of
these microscopic structures can be used to infer rates of dental development and other physiological
properties. Tooth microstructure has been well studied in living mammal groups as well as in many fossil
members of the mammalian crown group. However, our knowledge of tooth microstructure outside
crown-group mammals is spotty. This paper looks at the evolution of tooth microstructure in a series of
fossil taxa that bracket the origin of mammals. It is important both because it empirically documents the
pattern of microstructure in these extinct taxa and because it uses those patterns to evaluate what we
know about the evolution of skeletal growth, tooth replacement patterns, and their physiological context.
I am strongly positive about the paper. The writing is very clear, the figures are fabulous, and the text
should be accessible to all scientific readers, regardless of whether they were previously familiar with
tooth microstructure or not.
We are grateful for the reviewer's positive comments!
I only have three comments:
1. Abstract: In contrast with the rest of the paper, the abstract is unlikely to be accessible to non-
specialists. I suggest switching the abstract with the final Summary, because the latter makes all the
same points in non-technical language.
At the suggestion of the reviewer, we have switched the final summary and the abstract to make the
abstract more clear to non-specialists.
2. Body mass correction (p. 9). In principle, the body mass regressions should be done using phylogenetic
correction in order to estimate the body mass-to-DSR –CER relationships. This produces an estimate of
the relationship between the variables that is unbiased by phylogenetic similarity and thus maximizes the
contribution of the underlying developmental relationship between the two. You could make such a
correction using either a regression of phylogenetically independent contrasts or the PGLS method of
Martins and Hansen (1997). A wide range of software is available to do this, including the R statistical
package. You can use the resulting regression coefficients for the size correction steps on p. 10.
We have now performed the body mass corrections using PGLS, as suggested by the reviewer, and re-
run subsequent analyses using the regression coefficients from these new PGLS regressions. We have
altered the Methods and Results sections, Figure 6, Table 2 and the Supplementary Material
accordingly. Major changes to the text occur on page 9, last paragraph; page 12, paragraph 2; page 13,
paragraph 1 and page 16, paragraph 2, although there are additional, small changes elsewhere. The
results of MANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests following the new PGLS size-correction were very similar
to those presented originally. The only important difference between the new analysis (following PGLS
correction) and the original analysis is that in the new analysis both mammaliamorphs and non-
probainognathians have significantly lower DSR than non-hypsodont mammals (while in the original
analysis there was no significant difference between mammaliamorphs and non-hypsodont mammals
with respect to DSR). We briefly mention this result on page 12, paragraph 2, and again in the
Discussion (page 16, paragraph 2), but since it has little impact on the main conclusions of the study
regarding differences between groups in crown extension rates (these differences remain the same as
in the original analyses), we do not devote long discussion to it.
3. Figure 4: It would be useful to rearrange the parts in phylogenetic order (A Diademodon, B
Massetognathus, C. Irajatherium, D. Oligokyphus, E. Morganucodon). It would also be useful to provide
high-resolution versions of these and micrographs in the supplemental files.
The images have been rearranged as suggested alongside changes suggested by Referee 3 regarding
this figure. High-resolution versions of the files have been uploaded to the Dryad depository
associated with this paper as the journal places a size restriction on files uploaded via the submission

Referee 3
Very good paper, is publishable with only minor clarifications.
This manuscript describes the first comprehensive measurements of diapsid-to-mammal transitions in
enamel periodicity. The data look very good, the analyses and interpretations are justified by the data,
and clearly explained. The manuscript is very well written, but could easily be edited to be much shorter,
both in terms of the topics introduced (and the amount of detail given) and also in making Methods and
Results sections more succinct without extraneous discussion of points that should probably either be
introduced in the Introduction or left to the Discussion to discuss. However, I see that it gives nice, clear
definitions of all concepts and so is easy to read for someone new to the field, and so this is an argument
to keep some of that text.
As the Reviewer 3 (and Reviewer 2) point out, one of the aims of this paper is to make this work
accessible to a broad audience. In particular, we seek to address both specialists in dental
microstructure and specialists in synapsid evolution, and there has hitherto been very little overlap
between these topics. We therefore think it is useful to go into both dental microstructure and
cynodont evolution in some detail, so that the entirety of the study is clear to those who may not be
so familiar with these topics. We hope that future work on the evolution of dental growth (whether
performed by us or by other researchers) will benefit from having available a fairly detailed summary
of existing knowledge on enamel growth in the early mammalian lineage. Nevertheless, we take the
reviewers point about extraneous detail in the Methods and Results and have removed several long
sentences from the end of the Methods section (in the last two paragraphs of page 10) and the second
paragraph of the Results section (page 12).
I have only minor suggestions or corrections to make:
Please be more specific in your figure references to parts within figures – if a first point refers to A, then
reference Figure 7A, and the second is pointing to B, then reference Figure 7B.
We have been more specific in our figure references where appropriate e.g. page 4, line 23; page 4,
line 30; page 5, line 32; page 6, line 30; page 13, line 14; page 14, line 12; page 16, line 25; page 16, line
29; page 16, line 34.
P5L10: change ‘one-on-one’ to ‘one-to-one’.
Corrected as suggested.
P5L47: change to “Tomes’ process”.
Corrected as suggested.
P7L50: add closing parenthesis.
Corrected as suggested.
P8L48: Length y does not exactly represent increase in crown height; crown height would normally be
measured perpendicular to the base of the tooth, and length y will run at an angle to this vertical
distance. It does represent the absolute length of extension of the EDJ, and so that is how it should be
described. (Similarly, Figure 3 caption.)
Corrected as suggested, both in main text and figure caption.
P12L27: I do not think the statistical analysis using individual tooth values is necessary, or particularly
valid, and would be worth leaving out of the manuscript as the results are apparently essentially the
same.
We agree that this is probably unnecessary extra detail, and have left out all mention of the individual
tooth values, i.e. all statistical analysis now refers to species average values. Methods and Results
sections have been altered accordingly e.g. last paragraph of Methods section, page 10.
P12L45: The statistical tests using 1-day long-period periodicity rather than 2-day will of course give the
same results if all of these taxa have the same periodicity, and so are not a valuable addition to the
manuscript. Given your conclusions later about equivalency of periodicity in enamel and dentine it is not
necessary to give additional detail/discussion on the 1-day enamel periodicity.
The 1-day periodicity assumption applies only to those taxa which are introduced for the first time in
this study (i.e. non-probainognathians and mammaliamorphs). Of course, as the reviewer says, so long
as the periodicity is the same for both groups we expect the same differences in growth rate when
comparing the two groups, regardless of whether they have 1- or 2-day periodicity. However, crown
mammal growth rates remain the same under both assumptions (their periodicity does not alter even
when we assume different periodicities in the cynodont groups) and so the relationships of the
cynodont species to crown groups have the potential to be slightly different under the different
assumptions for the cynodont enamel. The revised statistical analyses requested by Reviewer 2 (with
body mass corrected using PGLS) do, in fact, result in a slight difference between tests using 1-day and
tests using 2-day periodicity. Non-hypsodont mammals do not differ from mammaliamorphs in DSR
under a 1-day assumption, while there is a difference between the two groups with respect to DSR
under a 2-day periodicity assumption. This does not alter the main conclusions of the study in any
meaningful way, and the dentine tests do strongly suggest that the cynodonts have a 2-day
periodicity, so we do not discuss results under the 1-day assumption at great length. Nevertheless,
given that only eight cynodonts have been included in this study, and that there is no unequivocal (e.g.
radio-labelling) evidence for periodicities in non-mammals, we would like to remain open to the
possibility that the periodicity in cynodonts may be other than 2 days, and make statistics regarding an
alternative possibility available. We therefore retain the 1-day periodicity tests, but discussion of
these statistics is restricted to a single paragraph in the Results (top of page 13) and a single sentence
(starting page 16, line 18) in the Discussion.
P12L55: isolated closing parenthesis.
Corrected as suggested.
P35L44: add ‘(green)’ when first referring to striae of Retzius.
Added as suggested.
Figure 3: what are the 3 lines on top left of figure that meet the outer enamel surface? If they are
intended to be indicative of cementum layers then you should give them a different colour or omit them.
These are intended to be incremental lines of the enamel, some of which reach the surface. A
sentence has been added to the figure caption to clarify this.
Figure 4: I’m not sure that A has to be twice the size of B-E; it could be cropped to the lower right corner
where incremental lines are clear, or the top half could also be cropped as the lines are not very clear
there. Also, it would be worth mirroring A and E to have cervix direction consistent among figures. What
does ‘soft focus’ in C mean? Does this mean out of focus so that both lines are equally visible, but still
somewhat out of focus because the two lines are not in the same plane of focus?
Note that we have reordered the images in this figure following a suggestion from Reviewer 2. In
addition, we have cropped the top half of A (Diademodon) as suggested, and used mirror images of A
(Diademodon) and E (Irajatherium – now reordered to position C) to keep the cervix direction
consistent. Long- and short-period lines in C (Morganucodon – now reordered to position E) are not in
precisely the same plane within the section and so the image is taken slightly out of focus in order to
visualise both increment types. We have clarified this in the figure caption.
Figure 5: it would be useful to indicate equivalent enamel incremental lines on this figure to show more
clearly the relationship to dentine incremental lines, i.e. do the same number of enamel and dentine
increments start at the EDJ over the same length? From the similarity in crown extension rates it seems
clear that they will line up nicely.
We have indicated equivalent dentine and enamel lines, as the reviewer suggests. The figure caption
has been altered to explain this.
Figure 7: It would be worth drawing over some of the incremental lines and the EDJ and showing the
angle between them to more clearly illustrate your point, although I realise that the incremental lines
marked in B do not meet the EDJ in this image, and so perhaps a different part of the tooth would be
better.
We have drawn over some incremental lines and the EDJ in this figure, as the reviewer suggests.

1 Abstract
2 The early evolution of mammals is associated with the linked evolutionary origin of
3 diphyodont tooth replacement, rapid juvenile growth and determinate adult growth.
4 However, specific relationships among these characters during non-mammalian cynodont
5 evolution require further exploration. Here, polarised light microscopy revealed two orders
6 of incremental lines, resembling daily laminations of extant mammals, in histological
7 sections of enamel in eight non-mammalian cynodont species. Periodic increments in the
8 enamel of non-mammalian cynodonts take the form of laminations with daily secretion
9 rates similar to those of most non-hypsodont crown mammals. In the more basal non-
10 probainognathian groups, enamel extends veryextremely rapidly from cusp to cervix.
11 resulting in crown extension rates more similar to those of the derived dentition of
12 hypsodont crown mammals. In contrast, the enamel of mammaliamorphs is gradually
13 accreted, with slow rates of crown extension, more typical of the majority of non-hypsodont
14 crown mammals. These results are consistent with the reduction in dental replacement rate
15 across the non-mammalian cynodont lineage, with greater rates of crown extension
16 required in most non-probainognathians, and slower crown extension rates permitted in
17 mammaliamorphs and Exaeretodon, which have reduced patterns of dental replacement in
18 comparison with many non-probainognathians. The evolution of more mammal-like growth
19 patterns, with faster juvenile growth and more abruptly terminating adult growth, is linked
20 with this reduction in dental replacement rates and may provide an additional explanation
21 for the observed pattern in enamel growth rates. It is possible that the reduction in enamel
22 extension rates in mammaliamorphs reflects an underlying reduction in skeletal growth
23 rates at the time of postcanine formation, due to a more abruptly terminating pattern of
24 adult growth in these more mammal-like, crownward species. Commented [WD1]: At the suggestion of Referee 2, we
have switched the final summary and the abstract to

26 mammals. We compared two enamel growth measures, daily secretion rate (DSR) and
27 crown extension rate (CER), in crown mammals and diapsids and in two non-mammalian
28 cynodont groups, non-probainognathians and mammaliamorphs. CER was extremely high in
29 non-probainognathians; enamel extended rapidly in sheath-like layers, in comparison with
30 the gradual accretion of enamel in more crownward mammaliamorphs. This is consistent
31 with reduction in rates of dental replacement in mammaliamorphs, which would permit
32 slower crown extension, while greater replacement rates in non-probainognathians may
33 have required more rapid formation rates. Additionally, low rates of ameloblast
34 differentiation, which cause low CER, may be coupled with reduced osteoblast function. Low
35 CER in mammaliamorphs therefore suggests reduced rates of bone growth during
36 postcanine formation, consistent with more mammal-like abrupt termination of growth in
37 these animals in comparison with more stemward cynodonts.

41 Introduction
42 Periodic incremental markings in enamel and dentine represent a permanent record of
43 dental development, produced by the gradual accretion of dental hard tissue in amniote
44 teeth. Different orders of increment differ in temporal periodicity, ranging from sub-daily to
1 annual (reviewed in [1–4]), with rates of formation governed by biological rhythms of
2 differing duration. The use of these incremental markings to infer rates of dental growth and
3 to reconstruct life-history and ecology has become well-established in extant and extinct
4 mammals [3–15]. While similar studies of incremental markings, particularly using dentine,
5 have been extended to extant and extinct non-mammalian amniotes [16–26], there has
6 been relatively little investigation of the enamel increments of non-mammalian synapsids
7 beyond identification of the presence of periodic markings within the broader context of
8 describing synapsid enamel microstructure [19,23,27–29].
9 In this study, for the first time, we compare rates of enamel development inferred from
10 incremental markings in a range of non-mammalian cynodont species. We define Mammalia
11 as a crown group (all descendants of the last common ancestor of monotremes, marsupials,
12 and placentals [30]). Mammaliaformes is an apomorphy-based clade designating synapsids
13 with a dentary-squamosal jaw joint; Morganucodon is among its most basal known
14 members [30]. Mammaliamorpha is used here sensu Rowe [30] as the clade comprising the
15 last common ancestor of Tritylodontidae and crown Mammalia, and its descendants, and
16 thus includes Mammaliaformes. These relationships are illustrated in figure 1, following the
17 phylogeny of Ruta et al. [31]. Under these definitions, non-mammalian cynodonts include
18 both non-mammalian mammaliaforms and mammaliamorphs sensu Rowe [30].
19 Improving knowledge of rates of dental growth in non-mammalian cynodonts has the
20 potential to greatly enhance our understanding of a crucial transition in growth patterns and
21 dental characteristics at the base of the mammaliaform lineage. Diphyodonty, the single
22 replacement of antemolars and non-replacement of molars, is a major mammalian
23 apomorphy [32–37] and represents a reduction in the number of tooth replacements from
24 the basal amniote condition of polyphyodonty, or continuous alternating replacement of the
25 dentition throughout life [36, 38–40]. The mammaliaform Morganucodon is the most
26 anatomically plesiomorphic stem-mammal to have diphyodont tooth replacement [33,
27 36,37,41–45; see figure 1], and the origin of diphyodonty was likely permitted by the
28 evolution of placental mammal-like skeletal growth patterns in Morganucodon [46]. Both
29 rapid juvenile growth and a determinate pattern of adult growth, in which skeletal growth
30 ceases after a maximum size is reached, were likely necessary for the evolution of reduced
31 diphyodont tooth replacement; determinate growth reduces the requirement for larger
32 replacement teeth to fill an expanding jaw [36, 47,48], while rapid juvenile growth limits the
33 time period in which teeth of intermediate size are required [32,48].
34 The origins of diphyodonty and mammal-like skeletal growth patterns are linked with the
35 subsequent evolution of other important mammalian characteristics of the braincase,
36 olfactory cavity and dentition in more crownward mammaliaforms (figure 1). These features
37 include precise molar occlusion [32,47,49] in which it is important to maintain constant
38 relative positions of upper and lower dentitions. This might be compromised by multiple
39 replacements of teeth or more extended periods of jaw growth, and also depends on
40 possession of a true dentary condyle articulating with the squamosal. The evolution of
41 diphyodonty and mammal-like growth are also likely to be correlated with the origin (or,
42 more likely, multiple convergent origins [20,50]) of prismatic enamel, which may have
43 evolved to prevent propagation of cracks through enamel [51,52]. Rather than being
44 replaced, the permanent dentition would be required to last throughout the entire adult
1 lifetime of a diphyodont animal. In addition, the evolution of lactation [37,48], and
2 mammalian jaw closing mechanisms [32, 47, 49, 53] are linked with this transition towards
3 more mammal-like growth patterns and dentition. Thus investigation of growth, and
4 particularly of dental growth, across the cynodont-to-mammaliaform transition has the
5 potential to provide greater understanding of many aspects of the origin of mammalian
6 biology.
7 Previous studies have investigated growth patterns in non-mammalian cynodonts during this
8 crucial transition, chiefly using bone histology methods (e.g. [54–59]), assessment of
9 ontogenetic series (e.g. [60,61]), or comparison of size ranges of specimens (e.g.
10 [36,37,46,62]). In this study, we further explore the link between growth patterns and
11 dentition by investigating absolute rates of growth within the dentition itself, a method not
12 previously applied to these animals. We investigate enamel deposition and extension rates
13 in Morganucodon, the most plesiomorphic known diphyodont mammaliaform, in more
14 stemward cynodonts, and in crown mammals and diapsids, in order to assess at what point
15 in the cynodont lineage mammal-like patterns of enamel growth become evident.
16 Enamel microstructure in mammals and non-mammalian cynodonts
17 The development of mammalian enamel begins with the differentiation of ameloblasts over
18 the dentine horns, located under the future cusps of the tooth. Differentiating ameloblasts
19 extend towards the cervix (the constricted junction between the crown and the root) along
20 the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ), increasing the height of the tooth crown [63]. Ameloblast
21 and odontoblast differentiation is reciprocally induced (each cell type must receive signals
22 from the other in order to differentiate), and so dentine-secreting odontoblasts differentiate
23 almost simultaneously along the outer dentine surface of the EDJ [64,65]. During enamel
24 development, ameloblasts move are displaced progressively further from the EDJ towards
25 the future outer enamel surface, secreting enamelthrough the secretion of enamel matrix. Commented [WD2]: We have changed the wording
based on the suggestion of Referee 1
26 Initially, newly secreted enamel contains enamel specific proteins, which regulate the
27 growth of enamel apatite crystallites. Expansion of these crystallites and removal of organic
28 matrix then follows during the maturation phase [66,67], although the precise role of the
29 matrix protein amelogenin has recently been questioned [68].
30 A fundamental structural unit of mammalian enamel is the enamel prism. Prisms extend
31 without splitting or merging from close to the EDJ to close to the outer enamel surface and
32 are formed from bundles of long ribbon-like carbonato-apatite crystallites with long axes
33 running in the same longitudinal direction as the prism [69–72]. Each Each prism head is Commented [WD3]: We have left this sentence as is

34 produced by a single ameloblast and therefore traces the path of that ameloblast from the

36 paths, strengthening the enamel structure [70,73]. Between enamel prisms is interprismatic
37 enamel (figure 2, top panel), in which parallel crystallites are orientated obliquely from the Commented [WD5]: Corrected
38 crystallites of the prisms.
39 The structure which secretes enamel is a projection of the ameloblast known as the Tomes'
40 process. Initially, during enamel secretion, an ameloblast has a relatively flat secretory
41 surface. This is known as the proximal portion of the Tomes' process, and it secretes only
42 prismless enamel, with crystallites orientated in the same direction as interprismatic enamel
43 [74,75]. The ameloblast later develops an extended distal portion of the Tomes' process, as
44 an outgrowth of the proximal portion (figure 2, top panel). This has an associated enamel
1 secretory site distinct from the proximal secretory sites which are now located around the
2 base of the extended Tomes' process [15,72]. The proximal site secretes interprismatic
3 enamel to form an encircling pit into which the distal site secretes the prismatic enamel. The
4 distal portion of the Tomes' process regresses towards the end of enamel secretion, and a
5 layer of prismless enamel is formed close to the outer enamel surface [15,72]. Thus, thin
6 layers of prismless interprismatic enamel are often observed close to the EDJ and outer
7 enamel surface, with prismatic enamel between them.
8 The enamel of non-mammalian cynodonts differs from that of mammals as it lacks the
9 distinction between prismatic and interprismatic enamel. An exception to this is the
10 tritheledontid Pachygenelus which is reported to have a plesiomorphic prismatic enamel
11 structure [27,50]. A variety of terms have been applied to the enamel types observed in non-
12 mammalian cynodonts and in diapsids including <U+02BB>aprismatic', <U+02BB>non-prismatic', <U+02BB>pseudo-
13 prismatic' and <U+02BB>preprismatic' (reviewed in Sander [19]). In order to clarify the terminology of
14 prismatic structure in non-mammals, Sander [19] suggests that all enamel lacking prismatic
15 structure be referred to as <U+02BB>prismless', and this is the term we use throughout this study.
16 The prismless enamel of the majority of non-mammaliaform cynodonts, and also of
17 Morganucodon, is of a type identified as synapsid columnar enamel [20,76,77; see figure 1]
18 in which the enamel is arranged in parallel, non-decussating columns perpendicular to the
19 outer enamel surface [29,71,76]. This resembles the columnar enamel of many reptiles
20 [19,70]. These columns are elongate, with some extending almost to the outer enamel
21 surface, although others are discontinuous [71]. The ameloblasts of cynodonts are likely to
22 have followed a similar path to those of mammals, from EDJ to outer enamel surface.
23 However, hypotheses of amelogenesis in synapsids suggest that the mineralization front
24 lagged behind the secretion front during maturation of the enamel, so that there is not
25 necessarily a one-onto-one relationship between individual ameloblasts and columnar units Commented [WD6]: Corrected on advice from Referee
3
26 [71]. It is also likely that ameloblasts secreted enamel across a flat secretory surface and
27 lacked Tomes' processes with separate sites for prismatic and interprismatic enamel [71]. Formatted: Highlight
28 Periodic increments in mammalian enamel
29 Several different types of enamel increment, each with a consistent periodic repeat interval,
30 have been identified among extant mammals. These are illustrated in figure 2. Increments
31 form as the rhythmic changes in ameloblast secretion over different time scales alter the
32 mineral composition of enamel [78,79]. These can be divided into three basic types, sub-
33 daily or intradian, daily or short period, and supra-daily or long period. In primates, the daily
34 increments in enamel are cross striations [1,6], while in artiodactyls and perissodactyls, the
35 daily increments are laminations [15,80–83]. The supra-daily lines are referred to as striae of
36 Retzius or Retzius lines [4]. There have not been enough of studies of other mammals to
37 determine the periodicity of the various lines representing incremental growth, although
38 they have been identified in a wide range of mammals (e.g. [9,12,84,85]. In primates, daily
39 cross striations and striae of Retzius correspond with short- and long-period lines in dentine,
40 known as lines of von Ebner and Andreson, respectively [86–88].
41 Studies using vital labelling of forming enamel have demonstrated that cross-striations have
42 a 24 hour periodicity in primates [3,89,90], while laminations have been demonstrated to
43 have a daily periodicity in artiodactyls [14,15,80]. Under polarised light microscopy, cross-
1 striations appear as pairs of light and dark bands crossing enamel prisms perpendicularly,
2 parallel to the secretory face of the Tomes' process [78; see figure 2, top panel].
3 Laminations, despite their daily nature, differ from cross-striations in that they do not
4 necessarily cross enamel prisms perpendicularly, but rather follow a course parallel to the
5 striae of Retzius [3,14,15,80–82,91]. The daily nature of cross-striations is often used to infer
6 the rate and duration of formation of other enamel increments in both primates and other
7 mammals, in which they have also been assumed to be daily. Sub-daily lines (i.e., under 24
8 hours) have also been observed between cross-striations in primate enamel; they may have
9 a 12 hour rhythm, although their appearance can be variable and localised [3]. Alternatively,
10 what appear to be sub-daily lines in enamel with daily laminations may represent the same
11 circadian biorhythm expressed in the interprismatic enamel, offset by the distance between
12 the proximal and distal ends of the Tome’s’ process [15]. Commented [WD7]: Corrected.
13 Striae of Retzius (figure 2) are longer-period features than cross-striations, and represent Formatted: Highlight
14 successive positions of the forming front of enamel [3,78]. They originate from the lateral or Formatted: Highlight
15 shoulder region of the ameloblast [3, 92], and so cross the enamel prisms at an oblique
16 angle (in contrast to the perpendicular cross-striations). Striae of Retzius form successive
17 dome shapes over the dentine horn, and extend towards the cervix as enamel is gradually
18 accreted. In cuspal enamel the striae do not reach the outer enamel surface, but in lateral
19 enamel they manifest as perikymata (shallow grooves) on the enamel surface [5,78,93].
20 The number of cross-striations between adjacent pairs of striae of Retzius is known as the
21 repeat interval. It is consistent within an individual [94,95] in primates, but varies between,
22 and occasionally within, species [95,96]. Similarly, multiple laminations may be present
23 between adjacent striae of Retzius [81,84]. It is possible for the repeat interval of cross-
24 striations or laminations to be one, in which case striae of Retzius can themselves represent
25 daily intervals [10,14,15,80]. The biological mechanism underlying the formation of striae of
26 Retzius has not been fully established. They may reflect the interaction of two different
27 shorter-period rhythms [97,98], although this does not account for all variation in striae of
28 Retzius repeat intervals observed in extant primates [3]. Alternatively, they may represent
29 periodic intensification of the processes underlying cross-striation formation [99]. A recent
30 hypothesis suggests that they are the expression of a hormonally mediated biorhythm
31 underlying growth and bone formation in mammals, mediated by the hypothalamus through
32 a neuroendocrine mechanism [9]. Commented [WD8]: Text altered at the suggestion of
Referee 1
33 The mechanism by which laminations are produced is debated. Tafforeau et al. [81] suggest
34 that they represent three-dimensional alignments of cross-striations, while Smith [3] argues
35 that laminations and cross-striations are morphologically distinct, with laminations formed
36 across the entire secreting front of enamel. In the latter hypothesis, it is chiefly the
37 interprismatic growth regions which contribute to lamination formation, in contrast to the
38 process of prism cross-striation formation for which the prismatic growth regions are
39 responsible. This view of a separate origin of laminations from cross-striations is supported
40 by Kierdorf et al. [14], who find that lamination formation in the largely interprismatic inner
41 enamel of sheep is associated with the interprismatic growth region of the proximal Tomes'
42 process, rather than the prismatic enamel growth region of the distal Tomes' process (figure
43 2, top panel). Kierdorf et al. [15] also suggest that a similar explanation for lamination
44 formation holds in those regions of dwarf domesticated suid enamel where interprismatic
1 enamel dominates. However, in those regions where prismatic rather than interprismatic
2 enamel dominates, but where laminations are visible, alignment of cross-striations, as
3 described by Tafforeau et al. [81], may best explain the appearance of laminations. Thus the
4 two major explanations for lamination formation are not necessarily incompatible. Note
5 that, regardless of differing interpretations of the mechanism behind lamination formation,
6 all the above authors agree that laminations are daily in nature, and that laminations can be
7 used to calculate rates of enamel formation and crown formation times [3,14,15,81].
8 Periodic increments in non-mammalian cynodont enamel
9 Periodic increments have previously been reported in the enamel of several species of non-
10 mammalian synapsid. Grine et al. [27] found lines running parallel to the enamel surface in
11 both Diademodon and Thrinaxodon, and identified these bands as homologous with
12 mammalian striae of Retzius. Incremental lines identified as striae of Retzius have also been
13 reported in the enamel of Tritylodon [23,100]. Similar bands have been observed in the
14 tritylodontid Dinnebitodon [76: appendix], Massetognathus (Fig. 4 in [28]) and Exaeretodon
15 [29].
16 In this study we further investigate the incidence of such lines in a taxonomically broad
17 range of non-mammalian cynodonts, and use them to calculate rates of enamel secretion
18 and extension of the crown. We assess how dental growth rates changed throughout the
19 non-mammalian cynodont lineage, and how these changes may be linked with the evolution
20 of mammal-like skeletal growth patterns and reduced dental replacement, characteristics
21 which are a hallmark of the cynodont to mammaliaform transition.
22 Materials and Methods
23 Specimens
24 We sectioned teeth from both extinct non-mammalian cynodonts and from extinct and
25 extant crown crocodilians and mammals. The non-mammalian cynodont species
26 investigated were Thrinaxodon liorhinus, Diademodon sp., Scalenodon angustifrons,
27 Massetognathus pascuali, Exaeretodon riograndensis, Irajatherium hernandezi, Oligokyphus
28 sp. and Morganucodon watsoni. Table 1 details the species and tooth types sectioned. In
29 order to compare dental growth rates between species, we sectioned teeth from similar loci
30 (posterior lower postcanines) where possible, although the difficulty of obtaining rare fossil
31 specimens meant that in some cases we had to use teeth from upper postcanine loci (table
32 1). In Morganucodon and all extant mammals, almost all specimens sectioned were lower
33 second or third molars. The lack of differentiation between premolars and molars in non-
34 mammaliaform cynodonts made it difficult to section teeth directly homologous with m2 or
35 m3. Therefore, in non-mammaliaform cynodonts lower postcanines from the middle or
36 posterior of the tooth row were sectioned for most species (see table 1 for exceptions). All
37 the extant mammal and Morganucodon teeth sectioned were from the permanent
38 dentition, and in all other species the teeth sectioned were from adult-sized individuals.
39 Histological sectioning
40 Histological section preparation broadly followed the methods detailed in Reid et. al. [101].
41 The plane of section is important in the preparation of histological tooth sections; only by
42 sectioning through both the first and last formed enamel can the entire chronology of
1 enamel formation be captured in a single section. This requires the section to pass precisely
2 through the midline of a cusp, in the longitudinal plane, in order to ensure that the earliest
3 formed enamel at the tip of the dentine horn [3,102] is not obscured by later-formed
4 enamel in an obliquely cut section.
5 Teeth were sectioned longitudinally, from crown to cervix through the principal cusps in the
6 postcanines of all non-mammalian cynodonts. Varied tooth morphologies make it difficult to
7 homologise cusps across cynodont genera. Therefore, since it was not possible to take
8 sections through homologous locations in the teeth of these animals, sections were taken
9 through the largest cusp of each species. This maximises the length of EDJ which can be
10 observed in a section and, if the entire length is well-preserved in fossil specimens, allows a
11 maximum crown formation time to be calculated. Where the morphology of the tooth
12 permitted, multiple cusps were included in a section (table 1).
13 In addition, sections were taken through the principal cusps of teeth of two diapsid species
14 (the extant Crocodylus niloticus and an extinct Eocene crocodilian, Borealosuchus wilsoni)
15 and six crown mammal species (Canis familiaris, Tupaia tana, Panthera pardus, Procavia
16 capensis, Trichechus manatus and the extinct phenacodontid Ectocion sp. (table 1)). Commented [WD9]: Corrected.

19 vacuum, in equal parts of mixed acetone and polyester resin. They were then cleaned and
20 set in a second batch of polyester resin. This reinforces the tooth to prevent shattering
21 during the cutting phase of preparation. Three postcanines (UMZC T.480, UMZC T.485 and
22 UMZC T.486; all Diademodon specimens) had previously been set in resin by an unknown
23 method. These were sectioned using the same procedure as the other specimens, as
24 described below.
25 The teeth in resin were cut through the marked plane using a low speed saw (Microslice II
26 Annular Saw) with a 250 µm thick diamond wafering blade, to produce sections
27 approximately 800µm thick. In order to reduce their thickness, sections were mounted on
28 microscope slides and lapped using a PM2A lapping machine (Logitech Materials
29 Technologists Engineers) and 3 micron alumina powder until a thickness suitable for viewing
30 under a polarised light microscope (approximately 100µm depending on the section) was
31 attained. A 1 micron diamond polish was used to finish lapping the sections.
32 The sections were bathed in soapy water to remove any remaining polish, and cleaned in an
33 ultrasonic bath of distilled water. Each section was zero-bonded to the surface of a clean
34 glass microscope slide using a UV curing resin. Following further cleaning in an ultrasonic
35 bath, the sections were cleared using Histoclear®. Finally, the coverslip was mounted using
36 Histomount®, a histological mounting medium.
37 Imaging and measurements
38 Sections were visualised and photographed by transmitted linear polarized light microscopy Commented [WD11]: Corrected to clarify a question by
Referee 1
39 using an Olympus BX51 microscope mounted with a Q-Imaging Micro-Publisher 3.3 RTV
40 camera, or a Zeiss Axioplan 1 microscope mounted with a Canon A630 camera.
41 Measurements were taken using ImageJ 1.46 and Improvision Openlab 5.0.2 image analysis
42 software.
1 The periodic enamel increments in the non-mammalian cynodont specimens and in crown
2 mammal and diapsid specimens were used to calculate two important parameters of
3 enamel growth rates: daily secretion rate (DSR), the distance measured between two daily
4 lines, or the length of one daily increment, and crown extension rate (CER). Crown extension
5 rate (CER) is determined by the rate of ameloblast differentiation along the enamel-dentine
6 junction at the time of molar formation [12,13,72,103] and was calculated for crown
7 mammals using the method of cumulative prism lengths described by Risnes [104] and
8 modified by Dirks et al. [12], illustrated in figure 3. In our calculations in crown mammals, we
9 have assumed that cross striations are daily increments and striae of Retzius are long-period
10 increments. The distance along a prism from as close as possible the tip of the dentine horn
11 to a particular accentuated stria was measured. The mean DSR in this location was
12 calculated by measuring cross-striation lengths along this prism and closely neighbouring
13 prisms. Dividing the length of the prism from the EDJ to the accentuated line by the mean
14 DSR yields x days to form that length of prism (figure 3). The accentuated line (which
15 represents the forming front of enamel at a particular time) was followed back to its
16 intersection with the EDJ, and the length of EDJ (y µm) from this intersection to the tip of the
17 dentine horn was measured. Length y therefore represents the increase in crown heightEDJ
18 length along the EDJ after x days. Daily extension rate is therefore y/x. Starting with a new Commented [WD12]: Corrected.
19 prism intersecting the EDJ at the same point as the first accentuated line, this entire process
20 was repeated multiple times along the entire length of the EDJ. This allowed the crown
21 extension rate and daily secretion rate at different locations of the crown, from cusp to
22 cervix, to be calculated. The average CER from cusp to cervix was calculated as total length
23 of EDJ measured (Sy) divided by the total number of days (Sx). Average DSR for this length of
24 enamel was calculated as the overall mean cross-striation length measured. In those
25 sections in which measurements were taken from more than one cusp, a grand average CER,
26 and grand average DSR were taken for the entire tooth.
27 Increments of differing periods are clearly visible in the enamel of the non-mammalian
28 cynodonts and crocodilians, but differ somewhat from the increments of extant mammals,
29 more closely resembling the laminations found in the prismless enamel of extant mammals
30 [3]. We identified lines equivalent with daily cross-striations and striae of Retzius (see
31 Results section for this interpretation), which in non-mammalian cynodonts we will refer to
32 as <U+02BB>short-period incremental lines' and <U+02BB>long-period incremental lines' respectively. We used
33 these increments in an equivalent manner to the cross-striations and striae of Retzius in
34 extant mammals to calculate average DSR and average CER for all teeth, from animals in all
35 groups. Since it is difficult to follow the path of a single ameloblast in prismless enamel, such
36 as in that of the non-mammalian cynodonts or interprismatic enamel layers of crown
37 mammals, DSR measurements were taken between daily short-period lines at an orientation
38 perpendicular to the outer enamel surface, as this would be the most likely path taken by an
39 ameloblast producing prismless enamel.
40 Statistical analysis
41 Average daily secretion rate and average crown extension rate for all the non-mammalian
42 cynodont, extant mammal and diapsid species studied were compared with similar growth
43 rate measurements from additional crown mammal and diapsid species (Supplementary
44 Material, S1) taken from the literature (Supplementary Material, S2).
1 Body mass should be considered when assessing differences in growth rates between
2 species since there is a strong relationship between adult body mass and rates of body mass
3 growth in all major vertebrate groups, including mammals [105]. Larger crown mammals
4 also have larger teeth and jaws than smaller mammals. The area of the first molar has an
5 isometric or negatively allometric relationship with body length, which in turn is highly
6 correlated with body mass. Larger mammals have first molars that are either relatively small
7 or directly proportional to their body length, but allometric relationships vary between
8 clades [106]. We expect that these relationships mean that DSR and CER, which contribute
9 to tooth size and rate of growth, may also be correlated with body mass. In order to account
10 for the potential effect of differences in body mass on enamel growth rates between
11 species, we performed linear phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) regressions of
12 the log daily secretion rates and log crown extension rates of all species against log body
13 mass. This phylogenetic technique allows the growth variables to be adjusted for body mass
14 while also taking into account the non-independence of the data owing the shared
15 phylogenetic history of species [107,108]. The residuals from these PGLS regressions were
16 then used as body mass corrected DSR and body mass corrected CER in further analyses.
17 Body mass data for all species and details of the construction of the phylogenetic tree used
18 in PGLS analysis can be found in the Supplementary Material (S3 and S4). Commented [RO13]: Following advice from Reviewer
2, we have now performed size-correction using PGLS
19 In order to compare differences in enamel growth rates between different non-mammalian
20 cynodonts, crown mammals, and diapsids, species were sorted into five different groups:
21 mammaliamorphs (Morganucodon and Oligokyphus); non-probainognathian cynodonts
22 (Thrinaxodon, Diademodon, Scalenodon and Massetognathus); diapsids (Crocodylus,
23 Borealosuchus and Sphenodon), hypsodont crown mammals (Ovis aries [Catalonian breed],
24 Ovis aries [Soay breed] and Myotragus) and non-hypsodont crown mammals (all remaining
25 crown mammal species). Hypsodont and non-hypsodont mammals were included as
26 separate groups owing to the unusually high enamel growth rates in the former relative to
27 the latter (Supplementary Material, S1). It should be noted that while all non-mammalian
28 cynodont species are also non-hypsodont, throughout this study the term <U+02BB>non-hypsodont
29 mammals' refers only to those taxa in the crown group. Figure 1 illustrates the phylogenetic
30 relationships between diapsids, non-probainognathians, mammaliamorphs, and crown
31 mammals.
32 Exaeretodon was excluded from the analysis of these data because it showed a pattern of
33 enamel deposition unlike any other group of amniotes, extinct or extant (see Results).
34 Irajatherium appears to have a pattern of enamel growth intermediate between the non-
35 probainognathians and mammaliamorphs. Hence, we conducted separate tests, including
36 and excluding it in the mammaliamorph group or in the non-probainognathian group, in
37 order to probe its position.
38 Body mass corrected DSR and body mass corrected CER in the different groups were
39 compared in a MANOVA, following Box-Cox transformation of the variables for multivariate
40 normality [109]. The MANOVA was performed using the statistical program R v.2.15.13.4.4.
41 Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a generalised form of ANOVA in which
42 multiple dependent variables (transformed, body mass corrected DSR and transformed,
43 body mass corrected CER) can be compared between different groups [110]. We undertook
44 pairwise comparison of the different groups, and adjusted p-values for multiple comparisons
1 using false discovery rate (FDR) correction [111,112]. Since the two dependent variables
2 were relatively uncorrelated (pooled within-group correlation = 0.353),In addition, we
3 conducted separate univariate ANOVAs on each of these variables [110]. For each variable,
4 we performed pairwise comparisons of each group and corrected the significances of these
5 using FDR.
6 The main analysis was performed using the average DSR and CER of all teeth sectioned from
7 a species as a data point. Given the difficulty of obtaining rare fossil specimens for Commented [RO14]: Following a suggestion from
Reviewer 3, we have left out mention of the additional
8 sectioning, relatively low numbers of taxa were included in the mammaliamorph and non-

11 than using the average DSR and CER of all teeth sectioned from a species. Extant species
12 from which data from multiple teeth were available were treated in the same way. The
13 analysis was repeated using the average values of DSR and of CER from each species, and
14 hence with the smaller sample sizes for each group in order to assess whether increasing the
15 group sample sizes in this way affected overall interpretation of results. DIn addition,ue to
16 the small sample sizes of these groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test (a non-parametric analogue of
17 ANOVA), was also carried out separately on DSR and CER values in order to assess
18 differences between groups. This test was performed because although the assumption of
19 homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices was not violated in the MANOVA (Box's M was
20 not significant at a < 0.001 [108]), sample sizes were nevertheless small for some groups.
21 Dunn tests [113] were used to perform pairwise comparisons, and p-values were adjusted
22 for multiple comparisons using the FDR method.
23 Results
24 Enamel histology in non-mammalian cynodonts
25 We observed incremental lines in the enamel of all the non-mammalian cynodont species
26 we investigated. The increments formed regularly-spaced dark bands roughly parallel to the
27 enamel surface and EDJ, although in some species, notably the mammaliamorphs
28 Morganucodon and Oligokyphus, these bands formed a somewhat steeper angle with the
29 EDJ. These prominent dark bands are henceforth referred to as <U+02BB>long-period incremental
30 lines' and are marked with red arrows in figure 4. Fainter, dark sub-increments are visible
31 approximately at half the distance between pairs of long-period lines. These are referred to
32 as <U+02BB>short-period incremental lines' and are marked with black or white arrows in figure 4. In
33 all the cynodont species observed, one long-period increment (the distance between two
34 successive long-period lines) is composed of two short-period increments (the distance
35 between a short-period line and a long-period line).
36 The incremental lines in cynodont species (figure 4) differ from those most commonly
37 observed in extant mammals under light microscopy (e.g. Fig. 4 in [3]). Columnar cynodont
38 enamel lacks prisms, resulting in the absence of prism cross-striations, which usually cross
39 prisms perpendicularly in extant mammals [3]. However, cynodont incremental lines do
40 strongly resemble the laminations which may be found in the prismless surface enamel of
41 many extant mammals (Fig. 8 in [3]). These laminations have similar spacing to cross-
42 striations [3,15,82]. However, unlike cross-striations, laminations follow a course roughly
43 parallel to the striae of Retzius [14,15,80–82,91], which form successive dome-like layers
1 over the dentine horn in the cuspal enamel and extend towards the cervix, terminating at
2 the outer enamel surface in lateral enamel [5,78,93]. The incremental lines in cynodont
3 enamel also follow such a course (figure 4; figure 5). We suggest that the prominent, dark
4 long-period lines observed in cynodont enamel correspond with the striae of Retzius of
5 extant mammals, while the fainter short-period lines between them are homologous with
6 laminations, in other words, that there is a 2-day periodicity between the long-period lines,
7 with short-period lines representing one day of enamel secretion.
8 In the Discussion, we consider the possibility that the dark long-period lines actually have a
9 one-day periodicity (with the short-period lines being sub-daily), but conclude that this is
10 unlikely. Thus, unless stated otherwise, in all statistical analyses discussed below we base
11 our calculations of DSR and CER in cynodont enamel on the assumption that long-period
12 incremental lines have a 2-day periodicity.
13 Differences in enamel growth rates between groups
14 Figure 6 shows the differences between enamel deposition rates in different groups. The
15 majority of non-hypsodont crown mammals have a low DSR and CER, producing relatively
16 thin layers of enamel each day, which accrete gradually to form the crown of the tooth. In
17 contrast, hypsodont mammals develop their high-crowned teeth both by secreting thicker
18 layers of enamel each day, and extending enamel more rapidly along the EDJ. Diapsids have
19 low DSRs similar to those of non-hypsodont mammals, but have somewhat higher CERs.
20 Among cynodonts, the mammaliamorphs do not differ greatly from the non-hypsodont
21 mammalian pattern (although they do have relatively low DSRs in comparison to non-
22 hypsodont mammals), while non-probainognathian cynodonts differ in their much higher
23 CERs. Indeed, the CER values of most non-probainognathians exceed those of diapsids and
24 are comparable to those of hypsodont crown mammals. However, non-probainognathians
25 lack hypsodonty themselves and differ from high-crowned mammals in having low DSR
26 values, more similar to those of mammaliamorphs and non-hypsodont mammals. Thus non-
27 probainognathians resemble hypsodont mammals in having high CER, but resemble non-
28 hypsodont mammals in having low DSR. Irajatherium, a probainognathian tritheledontid,
29 shares a low DSR with all other cynodont species, but has a CER intermediate between the
30 rates of non-probainognathians and of mammaliamorphs. The derived traversodontid
31 Exaeretodon differs from all groups, extinct and extant in having both a low CER and a high
32 DSR.

37 p < 0.001) and confirms these differences between groups. Pairwise group comparison
38 shows that most groups differ significantly from one another (table 2a), although diapsids
39 show some overlap with other groups. Notably, there is no significant difference between
40 the mammaliamorph and non-hypsodont mammal groups (p = 0.4905; figure 6) but both
41 groups mammaliamorphs (p = 0.0163) and non-hypsodont mammals (p < 0.001) differ from
42 non-probainognathians (figure 6) (both with p < 0.001). Univariate ANOVAs performed
43 separately on body mass corrected and transformed DSR and CER were highly significant
44 (table 2b), and pairwise comparisons show that the difference between non-
1 probainognathians and mammaliamorphs and between non-probainognathians and non-
2 hypsodont mammals, is accounted for by differences in CER rather than DSR. Non-
3 probainognathians show a significant difference from mammaliamorphs the other two

5 significant difference from non-hypsodont mammals with respect to both growth measures

7 0.0189; table 2b), but their CERs do not differ significantly (p = 0.4438; table 2b). Hypsodont

11 mammals, while mammaliamorphs have low CER, similar to that of non-hypsodont
12 mammals. Both cynodont groups (mammaliamorphs and non-probainognathians) have

27 0.0816). Note that using species average values produces similar results (Supplementary
28 Material, S5.5).
29 All results reported above assume a 2-day periodicity between long-period lines (short-
30 period striations are assumed to be daily) as we consider this more likely than a possible
31 alternative interpretation of a 1-day periodicity between long-period lines (long-period lines
32 form in one day, with the short-period striations being sub-daily). However, in order to test
33 the effect of this assumption, we also calculated daily secretion rate (DSR) and crown
34 extension rate (CER) for all non-mammalian cynodont species assuming a 1-day periodicity
35 of long-period lines and repeated statistical tests under this assumption. As expected, under
36 a 1-day periodicity assumption, daily increments are twice as long as under a 2-day
37 periodicity assumption, and thus the crown extension rate is also roughly doubled, since the
38 time taken to cover a particular length of the EDJ is halved). Commented [WD17]: Corrected.

42 probainognathians, mammaliamorphs and non-hypsodont mammals is the same as for the
43 2-day periodicity assumption with respect to the important comparisons between non-
44 probainognathians, mammaliamorphs and non-hypsodont mammals (Supplementary
1 material, S6). Non-probainognathians differ from both mammaliamorphs (p = 0.0021) and
2 from non-hypsodont mammals (p = 0.0001) with respect to CER; non-hypsodont mammals
3 do not differ from mammaliamorphs with respect to CER (p = 0.3847). The only potentially
4 important difference under the 1-day periodicity assumption is that non-hypsodont
5 mammals do not differ from mammaliamorphs in DSR (p = 0.5489), while there is a
6 difference between the two groups with respect to DSR under a 2-day periodicity

10 Exaeretodon has a very unusual pattern of enamel growth, with high DSR, but low CER, and
11 appears to differ from all the groups included in this study (figure 6A). It was therefore
12 excluded from the statistical comparisons presented here.
13 Irajatherium, a probainognathian tritheledontid, appears to occupy an intermediate position
14 between the non-probainognathian group and the other probainognathians, Morganucodon
15 and Oligokyphus. It has a CER of 44.7 µm/day, compared to a mean CER of 86.0 µm/day in
16 non-probainognathians and 10.1 µm/day mean CER in mammaliamorphs. Repeating the
17 MANOVA including Irajatherium with mammaliamorphs in a <U+02BB>probainognathian group'
18 results in this probainognathian group still showing a significant difference from non-
19 probainognathians with respect to CER, and no significant difference from non-hypsodont
20 mammals with respect to CER (Supplementary Material, S8S7.1.2). Alternatively, including
21 Irajatherium in the non-probainognathian group also results in a significant difference
22 between non-probainognathians and mammaliamorphs with respect to CER, and no
23 significant difference from non-hypsodont mammals with respect to CER (Supplementary
24 Material, S8S7.2.2). These similar results, regardless of the group in which Irajatherium is
25 placed, reflect the intermediate enamel growth patterns of Irajatherium relative to non-
26 probainognathians and mammaliamorphs.
27 Discussion
28 We observed periodic incremental lines in histological thin sections of the enamel of all the
29 cynodont species in this study. This confirms previous observations of the presence of
30 incremental bands in the enamel of Thrinaxodon liorhinus [27], Diademodon sp. [27],
31 Massetognathus sp. [28], and Exaeretodon riograndensis [29], and provides evidence for
32 similar increments in the other species investigated (Scalenodon angustifrons, Irajatherium
33 hernandezi, Oligokyphus sp., and Morganucodon watsoni). We observed both short- and
34 long-period increments in cynodont enamel (figure 4), and consider these to be equivalent
35 to (respectively) the daily laminations and striae of Retzius of extant mammalian enamel.
36 Calculation of enamel growth rates from these increments shows that there is a very
37 pronounced difference in crown extension rate (CER) between more stemward non-
38 probainognathian cynodonts and more crownward mammaliamorphs.
39 The nature and periodicity of laminations in non-mammalian cynodont enamel
40 The appearance of daily markings as laminations rather than cross-striations in cynodont
41 enamel is consistent with current hypotheses concerning both the formation of laminations,
42 and the microstructure of non-mammalian cynodont enamel (figure 2). Smith [3] suggests
43 that the entire enamel-forming front of secretory ameloblasts is involved in the circadian
1 rhythm producing laminations, which therefore have a different topographic origin from
2 cross-striations. This is supported by evidence that laminations, although not restricted to
3 prismless enamel in extant mammals, are frequently found to be prominent in prismless
4 regions close to the EDJ and outer enamel surface [3,84,99]. These locations are formed
5 either before development of the distal portion of the Tomes' process, or after its
6 regression. Hence, cross-striations, which are produced perpendicular to prisms by one face
7 of the distal Tomes' process, are not formed [15,72].
8 Daily markings in these prismless regions instead take the form of laminations (figure 2, left
9 panel), produced from more proximal interprismatic enamel growth regions of the
10 ameloblast [15]. With the possible exception of Pachygenelus [50], the enamel of all the
11 non-mammalian cynodonts investigated to date is prismless [20,76,77]. Their ameloblasts
12 lacked Tomes' processes and enamel was produced across a flat secretory surface [71],
13 which would preclude the formation of cross-striations from distal secretory regions of the
14 ameloblast. Thus, the fact that daily markings take the form of laminations in non-
15 mammalian cynodonts is expected, given the hypothesised processes of enamel
16 development in these animals.
17 Uncertainty about 1- versus 2-day periodicity in enamel lamination is worth comment. If the
18 darker, long-period lines (figure 4) have 1-day periodicity, then the fainter, short-period lines
19 are sub-daily; if they represent a 2-day periodicity, then short-period lines are daily. Striae of
20 Retzius with multiple daily laminations between them have been observed: for example,
21 macaques have a 5-day periodicity between Retzius lines [84] while fossil and extant
22 rhinocerotids have a 7-day periodicity [81]. In contrast, enamel in which supra-daily lines are
23 not observed (i.e., striae of Retzius are indistinguishable from laminations with 1-day
24 periodicity) has also been shown to occur in other extant mammal groups such as cervines
25 [80], caprines [14], and suids [15].
26 In the enamel of domesticated dwarf Sus scrofa, which have periodic laminations of 1-day,
27 darker and broader incremental bands are successively followed by thinner and lighter
28 continuous incremental lines (Fig. 5 in [15]). Kierdorf et al. [15] suggest that these features
29 are formed simultaneously, with the darker, broader bands representing the forming front
30 of prismatic enamel produced by the distal Tomes' process, and the lighter incremental lines
31 representing the forming front of interprismatic enamel produced by the proximal part of
32 the Tomes' process. It could be possible to misinterpret these simultaneously produced, yet
33 spatially offset daily features; if the darker bands were designated as striae of Retzius and
34 the lighter as daily markings, a 2-day periodicity between the darker bands could be
35 erroneously surmised.
36 We consider it unlikely that such a situation has occurred in the non-mammalian cynodont
37 enamel. The long-period incremental lines and short-period incremental lines do not form
38 successive dark and light bands, but rather both types of line are distinct from, and darker
39 than, the surrounding matrix against which they appear (figure 4). Further, the ameloblasts
40 producing the prismless synapsid columnar enamel of these cynodont species lacked Tomes'
41 processes, and likely had flat secretory surfaces [71], so this mechanism of producing
42 simultaneously formed, spatially offset increments is extremely unlikely in non-mammalian
43 cynodonts.
1 Nevertheless, markings formed by sub-daily oscillation in ameloblast activity are also
2 occasionally visible between laminations [3,14,15], and misidentification of such sub-daily
3 markings for daily laminations could lead to underestimation of enamel growth rates.
4 However, these sub-daily markings are described as strongly resembling cross-striations
5 [14,15], and this is not the case for the short-period incremental lines of cynodont enamel,
6 which are laminar in appearance.
7 As a test of 1-day versus 2-day periodicity of the long-period incremental lines, we compared
8 the extension rates of enamel along the EDJ, assuming different periodicities, with extension
9 rates of dentine along the same length of EDJ in Diademodon (figure 5). The dentine of
10 Diademodon (and indeed all the other non-mammalian cynodonts in which increments were
11 observed) shows increments (figure 5) strongly resembling the lines of von Ebner which are
12 found in a broad taxonomic range of extant vertebrates [17,114,115], extinct dinosaurs
13 [18,26], and extinct synapsids [16, 23–25].
14 Periodic labelling in extant taxa shows that these lines accumulate daily [17, 115]. They
15 appear as alternating light and dark bands under polarised light [18] with an average width
16 of 16 µm in small mammal species [115], although smaller widths of 4 µm are known for
17 humans and macaques [115]. Of previously studied non-mammalian synapsids, lines of von
18 Ebner are approximately 20 µm in Diictodon [16], 13.7 µm in Tritylodon [23], 17.4 µm in
19 Lystrosaurus [24], and 18.8 µm in an unnamed dicynodont [25]. The average width of the
20 increments we measured in Diademodon (11.9 µm) is somewhat narrower than in these
21 other synapsids. However, data from the three dicynodont species are from enlarged tusks
22 which may be expected to show greater rates of growth, and Diademodon dentine
23 increment widths fall well within the range of von Ebner line widths of other extinct and
24 extant amniote taxa. We therefore consider them to represent daily dentine deposition in
25 common with other amniotes.
26 We calculated average extension rate along the EDJ of Diademodon specimen UMZC T.485
27 using dentine lines of von Ebner in an equivalent manner to the method described for using
28 daily enamel increments, and found it to be 88.3 µm/day. Average extension rate along the
29 same length of EDJ, but using enamel increments instead of dentine, yielded 179.2 µm/day
30 assuming a 1-day periodicity of long-period incremental lines and 89.3 µm/day assuming a
31 2-day periodicity. Clearly the enamel and dentine extension rates are closely in accordance
32 under the 2-day periodicity of enamel assumption, but not under the 1-day periodicity
33 assumption.
34 Therefore, since the short-period lines we observe in non-mammalian cynodont enamel do
35 not greatly resemble the sub-daily markings between laminations, and since assuming a 2-
36 day periodicity of long-period lines yields extension rates along the EDJ more in accord with
37 those found using dentine daily increments, we conclude that the short-period and long-
38 period incremental lines of cynodont enamel are, respectively, the equivalents of daily
39 laminations and striae of Retzius in extant mammals, and that long-period incremental lines
40 have 2-day periodicity across all non-mammalian cynodonts studied.
41 Why the periodicity of long-period increments should be 2 days consistently across the non-
42 mammalian cynodonts is unclear; it would certainly be interesting to investigate a greater
43 taxonomic sample of cynodonts and more basal synapsids to establish how widespread this
1 characteristic may be. In addition, future studies could further test this result by focussing
2 on periodic vital-labelling of, for example, crocodilian or lepidosaur teeth in order to
3 improve our understanding of periodicity in extinct and extant non-mammalian amniotes.
4 Differences in enamel growth rates of non-mammalian cynodonts
5 There is a striking difference in enamel growth rates between more stemward non-
6 probainognathian cynodonts and the more crownward mammaliamorphs, Oligokyphus and
7 Morganucodon. This is demonstrated in a MANOVA of daily secretion rates (DSR) and crown
8 extension rates (CER), corrected by body mass in a phylogenetic context, in which
9 mammaliamorphs are found to differ significantly in their crown extension rates from non-
10 probainognathians, but not from non-hypsodont crown mammals in their crown extension
11 rates, suggesting that a more placental mammal-like pattern of enamel extension was
12 present in mammaliamorphs. Daily secretion rate is lower in both non-probainognathian
13 and mammaliamorph groups in comparison to non-hypsodont mammals, although the
14 difference is much less marked than the difference in CER between non-probainognathians
15 and mammaliamorphs; average DSR of the non-hypsodont mammals is approximately twice
16 that of the cynodont groups, while CER is approximately ten times as fast in non-
17 probainognathians in comparison to mammaliamorphs (Supplementary Material, S5.2). Commented [RO20]: This is the only change in results
following PGLS body mass correction. It does not have a

20 probainognathians and mammaliamorphs (Fig. S6.2, Supplementary Material), although the
21 differences in DSR between the cynodont groups and non-hypsodont mammals are not
22 significant under this assumption.
23 Figure 6A and 6B, separate univariate ANOVAs (table 2b) and Kruskal-Wallis tests
24 (Supplementary Material, S4S5.5) on DSR and CER show the major difference between non-
25 probainognathians and mammaliamorphs to be in the much greater CERs of non-
26 probainognathians. The relatively slow crown extension rates of mammaliamorphs are
27 reflected in the large angle by which long-period lines approach the EDJ (figure 7, top panel).
28 A larger angle of inclination indicates a more gradual accretion of enamel from cusp to
29 cervix, more similar to that seen in extant mammals; a shorter length of EDJ has been
30 covered by enamel over a particular period of time [103; see figure 3]. This contrasts with
31 the appearance of non-probainognathian enamel, in which long-period lines form a very
32 small angle with the EDJ (figure 7, lower panel), indicating that enamel has been laid in very
33 rapidly-extending sheath-like layers across large areas of the crown surface, rather than by
34 gradual accretion. The difference in CER between these groups is very pronounced, with
35 mean CER in non-probainognathians over 8 times more rapid than mammaliamorphs.
36 Indeed, the CER values of non-probainognathians are more comparable with those of the
37 extremely rapidly extending hypsodonts than with either mammaliamorphs or non-
38 hypsodonts (table 2b; figure 6).
39 Enamel extension rates and skeletal growth in non-mammalian cynodonts
40 We suggest that this very pronounced difference in crown extension rates between
41 mammaliamorphs and non-probainognathians relates to the changes in skeletal growth
42 pattern and dental replacement that occurred during the origin of mammaliaforms (figure
43 1).
1 One important aspect of this transition is the origin of a reduced diphyodont pattern of
2 dental replacement, which is observed most basally in the mammaliaform Morganucodon
3 [33,36,37,42]. Both rapid juvenile growth and determinate, truncated adult growth restrict
4 the time at which the jaws are at an intermediate size and thus the evolution of these
5 growth characteristics are likely a necessary condition for the evolution of reduced
6 diphyodont tooth replacement [32,36,46–48]. Mammal-like skeletal growth patterns are
7 indeed observed in more crownward non-mammalian cynodonts such as Morganucodon
8 and to some extent in Oligokyphus [36,46,62], while it is likely that more stemward non-
9 mammalian cynodonts had more extended, less determinate adult growth periods
10 [36,37,116]. Bone microstructure studies show that growth is not <U+02BB>indeterminate' in these
11 more stemward cynodont species (since growth does reduce in rate and eventually ceases in
12 adulthood), and that there is variability in growth strategies of non-mammalian cynodonts
13 and therapsids [57,58,117]. However, overall, there is a trend towards more rapid, mammal-
14 like bone deposition in more crownward groups [57,58,118].
15 The more mammal-like growth patterns of the mammaliamorphs Morganucodon and
16 Oligokyphus, in comparison with more stemward non-probainognathians, may account for
17 the differences observed in crown extension rate of the enamel of these groups. There is a
18 connection between rates of enamel growth and skeletal bone growth; Bromage et al. [9]
19 demonstrated that a single bone lamella forms during the same time period as the repeat
20 interval (number of days of formation) of the enamel striae of Retzius. They suggest that this
21 time interval reflects a fundamental rhythm, termed the Havers-Halberg Oscillation, which
22 regulates osteoblast proliferation and secretion, setting the pace of skeletal growth. This
23 rhythm then has a secondary effect on ameloblast activity and enamel formation rates,
24 resulting in coupling between enamel and bone growth [9].
25 While Bromage et al. [9] did not specifically investigate the relationship between bone
26 growth and enamel extension rate (which relates to ameloblast differentiation and
27 proliferation along the EDJ), similar coupling between bone osteoblast and ameloblast
28 differentiation and proliferation may be plausible. This possibility of a link between skeletal
29 growth and enamel extension rates is supported by the much higher extension rates of
30 deciduous teeth in comparison with permanent teeth in extant mammals [103,119], which
31 could be explained as a reflection of higher underlying rates of bone growth at the time of
32 deciduous tooth formation. Shellis [103] shows that, in humans, the enamel extension rate
33 of deciduous teeth (averaged across all different tooth types) is approximately five times
34 higher than the extension rate of permanent teeth (averaged across all different tooth
35 types). The effect is even more pronounced when deciduous extension rates are compared
36 with only the permanent third molar; in this case average deciduous enamel extension rates
37 are approximately eight times greater [103]. The permanent third molar forms during late
38 adolescence or early adulthood when underlying somatic growth rates are considerably
39 slowed or have ceased, perhaps resulting in concomitantly greatly reduced crown extension
40 rates.
41 A similar effect may account for the difference in enamel extension rates observed between
42 non-probainognathians and mammaliamorphs. The lower crown extension rates of
43 mammaliamorphs may suggest that underlying skeletal growth rates were much reduced at
44 the time of postcanine formation due to more determinate patterns of adult growth, while
1 non-probainognathians may not have ceased skeletal growth so abruptly, resulting in higher
2 underlying growth rates during postcanine formation, even in large individuals. While this
3 may be a plausible explanation of the differences between these two groups of non-
4 mammalian cynodonts, further information on the relationship between enamel crown
5 extension rates and bone growth in extant species would be required to support this
6 hypothesis. Additionally, it could be interesting to investigate enamel growth rates in
7 deciduous teeth of Morganucodon, or in earlier generations of teeth in more stemward non-
8 mammalian cynodonts; these could potentially permit construction of a profile of dental
9 growth rates at different stages of development within a species, which could lead to
10 greater understanding of the origin of determinate skeletal growth patterns.
11 Enamel extension rates and dental replacement in non-mammalian cynodonts
12 Although we argue that differences in underlying skeletal growth pattern may give rise to
13 differences in enamel extension rate, we do not think it fully accounts for the very large
14 differences between groups. Non-probainognathians have extension rates on average ten
15 times greater than in mammaliamorphs, and yet the difference in adult skeletal growth
16 patterns was unlikely to have been quite so pronounced between these groups. Bone
17 histological studies of many therapsids suggest that non-probainognathian skeletal growth
18 was generally asymptotic, and ceased in adult animals [55,58,59,120], even if not necessarily
19 so abruptly as in Morganucodon. Thus adult non-probainognathians would also be expected
20 to show reduced growth rates, and the enamel extension rates of non-probainognathians
21 may not be expected to differ from those of adult mammaliamorphs to the extreme
22 observed in this study. Therefore, while we certainly do not exclude underlying skeletal
23 growth as a, possibly important, contributing influence on enamel growth, it seems unlikely
24 that underlying growth differences are the sole explanation for differences in enamel
25 extension between non-probainognathians and mammaliamorphs. Changes in tooth
26 replacement rates relating to the origin of diphyodonty (figure 1) may also explain the
27 differences observed in this study between the two groups of cynodonts. Reduction in the
28 number of dental replacements in mammaliamorphs (in comparison with the majority of
29 non-probainognathians) may have permitted a longer growth period of the tooth row, and
30 hence slower rates of crown extension in individual teeth.
31 Diphyodont tooth replacement, in which antemolars are replaced only once and molars are
32 unreplaced, occurs in nearly all extant mammals, and most basally in Morganucodon
33 [33,36,37,42]. Most non-mammalian cynodonts stemward of Morganucodon, including for
34 example Thrinaxodon [61] and Pachygenelus [121], have polyphyodont, alternate
35 replacement from anterior to posterior along the tooth row, often with non-replacement of
36 the anterior postcanines [36,37,61,116,122]. Gomphodontian cynodonts show a variety of
37 dental crown morphologies and replacement modes. An interesting specialised form is
38 Diademodon in which the number of replacements is reduced, although not to same extent
39 as in diphyodont mammals [123]. The anterior postcanines are not replaced, but are shed to
40 form a diastema, with new teeth erupting at the distal end of the tooth row to maintain
41 tooth number. Other teeth are replaced by those of more mesial morphological
42 characteristics [60,123]. However, this highly derived and unusual condition likely relates to
43 maintaining occlusion of their differentiated gomphodont dentition during growth, rather
44 than to the origin of mammalian growth patterns [33,60,123,124]. Regardless, posterior
1 postcanines are still replaced in Diademodon [123] as they are in basalmost traversodontid
2 taxa, such as Andescynodon [125] and Boreogomphodon [126]. However, a reduction in
3 dental replacements is observed in more derived traversodontids; notably taxa more
4 derived than Massetognathus, such as Exaeretodon, show no replacement of the
5 postcanines, but new postcanines are added to the toothrow distally and lost mesially
6 [127,128]. Exaeretodon also loses postcanines during its development towards adulthood
7 [128]. Replacement mode is therefore variable among non-probainognathians. While
8 derived traversodontids, such as Exaeretodon, show no vertical replacement of the
9 postcanines, the majority of members of the group used here (i.e., non-probainognathian
10 cynodonts) have multiple replacements of postcanines with this trait being most
11 pronounced in the basal forms, such as Thrinaxodon [61].
12 In more crownward taxa such as tritylodontids (e.g., Oligokyphus), replacement is reduced,
13 in a similar manner to the condition of Exaeretodon, such that postcanine teeth are not
14 replaced at all, but discarded mesially and added distally with a mesial displacement of the
15 tooth row [36,48,129]. This reduction in dental replacement (albeit not to diphyodonty) in
16 tritylodontids may be permitted by their somewhat more mammal-like skeletal growth
17 patterns; growth in Oligokyphus differed from the patterns of non-avian diapsids, and
18 approached the condition of Morganucodon or extant placental mammals, although it likely
19 had a more extended period of adult growth [46].
20 The variability in modes of replacement among non-probainognathians, particularly
21 between Thrinaxodon [61] and “partially” sectorial toothed cynodonts with gomphodont
22 dentitions such as Diademodon [60,123], and also Andescynodon [125] and
23 Boreogomphodon [126], make direct comparison of the numbers of replacements in each
24 species difficult. However, it is clear that the greatest numbers of replacements occur in the
25 basal epicynodont Thrinaxodon, with relatively high replacement also observed in
26 Diademodon. The greatest reductions in replacement are seen in the two mammaliamorph
27 species, Morganucodon and Oligokyphus [36,48,129], and in the derived traversodontid
28 Exaeretodon [127,128]. Since Exaeretodon was excluded from the main analysis, the
29 mammaliamorph group represents a reduction in dental replacement in comparison with
30 most members of the non-probainognathian group in this analysis.
31 The relatively higher rates of replacement in more stemward non-probainognathians may
32 explain the need for higher rates of crown extension (e.g. Thrinaxodon: mean CER= 91.1
33 µm/day) in these animals; higher rates of crown extension would reduce overall tooth
34 development time, allowing relatively more frequent replacements at a particular locus.
35 Among more crownward mammaliamorphs, replacement rates are reduced, permitting
36 longer overall development times for the dentition, and a decrease in crown extension rates
37 (Morganucodon: mean CER = 4.8 µm/day; Oligokyphus: mean CER = 12.8 µm/day). Notably,
38 among non-probainognathians, Exaeretodon, which also has reduced postcanine
39 replacement, crown extension is also low (mean CER = 22.7 µm/day), while Thrinaxodon
40 (mean CER = 91.1 µm/day) and Diademodon (mean CER = 98.8 µm/day), have the greatest
41 rates of crown extension (Thrinaxodon has the greatest extension rate when adjusted for
42 body size). This supports a link between dental replacement and crown extension rates.
43 Irajatherium
1 The tritheledontid Irajatherium appears to have rates of enamel extension somewhat
2 intermediate between those of non-probainognathians and mammaliamorphs (figure 6).
3 This suggests that this species may have had an intermediate pattern of skeletal growth, or
4 reduction in dental replacement relative to non-probainognathians such as Thrinaxodon
5 [61], or both.
6 Preliminary studies on bone histology in Irajatherium show a rapid early growth with annual
7 interruptions later in ontogeny [118], which may be consistent with an intermediate pattern
8 of skeletal growth. Tooth replacement data in Irajatherium is still limited but it has been
9 shown to have the alternate postcanine replacement with loss of the anterior postcanines
10 typical of many more stemward non-mammalian cynodonts [130,131]. To assess whether
11 the numbers of replacements are reduced relative to more stemward non-mammalian
12 cynodonts would require investigation of additional material. Thus, further study of dental
13 replacement rates and growth in Irajatherium could serve as a useful test of our hypothesis
14 regarding the link between enamel extension rates, skeletal growth and dental replacement
15 in non-mammalian cynodonts.
16 In figure 1 we follow the recent dated phylogeny of Ruta et al. [31] in which Tritylodontidae
17 is resolved as the sister group to Mammaliaformes, with brasilodontids and ictidosaurians
18 forming successive outgroups (but see also [132,133]) In this phylogeny the intermediate
19 crown development of the tritheledontid Irajatherium appears to be part of a trend from
20 rapidly extending enamel in more stemward taxa towards the gradually accreting enamel of
21 mammaliamorphs. If, however, ictidosaurians are resolved in a closer relationship to
22 mammaliaforms [134–136] then there may be no general trend towards gradual reduction
23 in enamel extension rates in successively more crownward groups, but possibly separate
24 reductions in tritylodontids and mammaliaforms. Nevertheless, the entire probainognathian
25 group would represent a reduction in enamel extension rates relative to non-
26 probainognathians, with an even greater reduction in Morganucodon. This would
27 demonstrate an evolutionary plasticity of enamel developmental rates with convergence on
28 reduced enamel extension rates in separate lineages within probainognathians.
29 Exaeretodon
30 Plasticity is also shown in the unusual pattern of DSR and CER of Exaeretodon riograndensis.
31 This highly derived species differs not only from other non-probainognathians (i.e., other
32 gomphodontians and the basal epicynodont Thrinaxodon), to which it is phylogenetically
33 most closely related, but also from non-hypsodont mammals, mammaliamorphs and
34 hypsodont mammals. It had a CER similar to those of non-hypsodont mammals, but much
35 greater DSR values, which are comparable with those of hypsodont mammals or
36 domesticated dwarf Sus scrofa (which are brachydont, but with relatively thick enamel). We
37 suggest that the high DSR of Exaeretodon may have been an adaptation to growing a much
38 thicker enamel layer than other non-mammalian cynodonts. Across all other non-
39 mammalian cynodont species, the enamel layer is very thin; maximum enamel thickness
40 ranges from 39 µm in Morganucodon to only 125 µm in Diademodon (mean = 89 µm;
41 Supplementary Material, S9S8). This compares with a maximum enamel thickness of 431 µm
42 in Exaeretodon. This is probably an additional adaptation for grinding in its highly specialised
43 and robust triturating dentition [124]. In order to achieve this greater enamel thickness,
44 higher DSR would be required, rather than CER, which contributes to increased crown height
1 in artiodactyls [15] and elephantids [13], but not necessarily to increased enamel thickness.
2 The reduction in CER in Exaeretodon in comparison to other non-probainognathians most
3 likely relates to the fact that it does not replace its postcanine teeth during ontogeny; rather
4 it loses anterior postcanines and adds new ones at the end of the tooth row in a similar
5 manner to tritylodontids [127,128,137]. It therefore has reduced dental replacement
6 patterns in comparison with other non-probainognathians and, like mammaliamorphs, also
7 shows reduced CER. Exaeretodon is therefore consistent with the hypothesis linking reduced
8 CER with reduced dental replacement. From bone histology, its growth appears similar to
9 the flexible growth strategy of other traversodontid cynodonts, although with more rapid
10 juvenile growth [117]. This trend towards increased juvenile bone deposition rates in
11 traversodontids parallels the trend seen from stemward non-mammalian cynodonts to more
12 crownward forms [57,58,117]. As in many non-mammalian cynodonts, growth slowed as the
13 individual matured [117]. It is possible that Exaeretodon had achieved a more mammal-like
14 pattern of growth than other traversodontids, with faster juvenile growth and more abrupt
15 termination of growth, as in mammaliaforms, which may also partially explain its reduced
16 CER. It is interesting to note that the mammaliamorph-like pattern of enamel deposition in
17 Exaeretodon is consistent with other derived traits of its skull and postcranial anatomy
18 which show similarities with mammaliamorphs [128]; Rowe [30] even positioned
19 Exaeretodon as the sister taxon of Mammaliamorpha, although it has since been shown that
20 this taxon is well nested within gomphodonts and such features are therefore mostly
21 convergent with mammaliamorphs [31,138].
22 Summary
23 Periodic increments in the enamel of non-mammalian cynodonts resemble the daily
24 laminations and longer-period striae of Retzius of crown mammals. We compared two
25 enamel growth measures, daily secretion rate (DSR) and crown extension rate (CER), in
26 crown mammals and diapsids and in two non-mammalian cynodont groups, non-
27 probainognathians and mammaliamorphs. CER was extremely high in non-
28 probainognathians; enamel extended rapidly in sheath-like layers, in comparison with the
29 gradual accretion of enamel in more crownward mammaliamorphs. This is consistent with
30 reduction in rates of dental replacement in mammaliamorphs, which would permit slower
31 crown extension, while greater replacement rates in non-probainognathians may have
32 required more rapid formation rates. Additionally, low rates of ameloblast differentiation,
33 which cause low CER, may be coupled with reduced osteoblast function. Low CER in
34 mammaliamorphs therefore suggests reduced rates of bone growth during postcanine
35 formation, consistent with more mammal-like abrupt termination of growth in these
36 animals in comparison with more stemward cynodonts.Periodic increments in the enamel of Commented [RO21]: Summary and Abstract have been
switched following a suggestion from Reviewer 2
37 non-mammalian cynodonts take the form of laminations with daily secretion rates similar to
38 those of most non-hypsodont crown mammals. In non-probainognathians, enamel extends
39 very rapidly from cusp to cervix resulting in crown extension rates more similar to those of
40 the derived dentition of hypsodont crown mammals. In contrast, the enamel of
41 mammaliamorphs is gradually accreted, with slow rates of crown extension, more typical of
42 the majority of non-hypsodont crown mammals. These results are consistent with the
43 reduction in dental replacement rate across the non-mammalian cynodont lineage, with
44 greater rates of crown extension required in most non-probainognathians, and slower rates
1 permitted in mammaliamorphs and Exaeretodon, which have reduced patterns of dental
2 replacement in comparison with many non-probainognathians. The evolution of more
3 mammal-like growth patterns, with faster juvenile growth and more abruptly terminating
4 adult growth is linked with this reduction in dental replacement rates and may provide an
5 additional explanation for the observed pattern in enamel growth rates. It is possible that
6 the reduction in enamel extension rates in mammaliamorphs reflects an underlying
7 reduction in skeletal growth rates at the time of postcanine formation, due to a more
8 abruptly terminating pattern of adult growth in these more crownward species.

14 The relationships between non-mammalian cynodonts investigated in this study, and the
15 acquisition of characteristics related to growth and dentition in these animals. Teeth were
16 sectioned from all species with the exception of Sinoconodon. In statistical tests non-
17 mammalian cynodonts were assigned to two different groups, non-probainognathians (red)
18 and mammaliamorphs (purple), and compared with diapsids, non-hypsodont crown
19 mammals and hypsodont mammals. Irajatherium was not assigned to any group as its
20 enamel showed a pattern of growth intermediate between non-probainognathians and
21 mammaliamorphs. Exaeretodon was excluded from statistical analyses due to its extremely
22 unusual pattern of enamel deposition. Phylogeny after Ruta et al. [31].

26 the EDJ. Cross-striations and laminations both have a daily periodicity, but laminations
27 follow a course parallel to the striae of Retzius, while cross-striations are formed
28 perpendicular to enamel prisms, and thus may be oblique to striae of Retzius. Enamel is
29 secreted by ameloblasts moving progressively further from the EDJ. Prismatic enamel is
30 produced by the distal Tomes' process (Red), and interprismatic enamel by more proximal
31 portions of the Tomes' process (Blue). In extant mammals the distal Tomes' process is
32 initially absent during early enamel development, and also regresses towards the end of
33 development. Thus, during these stages of development, enamel is produced across a
34 relatively flat, <U+02BB>proximal', secretory surface, forming regions of interprismatic enamel close
35 to the EDJ and outer enamel surface. Laminations are most frequently observed in these
36 interprismatic regions in extant mammals, forming in line with the flat secretory surface of
37 the ameloblasts. Lower frames of figure follow Smith [3].

1 to its intersection with the EDJ, the length of EDJ, y, from its intersection with stria B and its
2 intersection with prism A can be measured. Length y therefore represents the increase in
3 crown heightEDJ length after x days. Daily extension rate is therefore y/x. Selecting a new Commented [WD24]: Corrected.
4 prism, intersecting the EDJ at the same point as stria B, allows the process to be repeated in
5 an additive manner along the entire length of the EDJ.

20 Polarised light microscope image of incremental lines in the enamel (top) and dentine
21 (bottom) of a postcanine of the non-mammalian cynodont Diademodon sp. Red Coloured
22 arrows indicate daily lines of von Ebner in the dentine. Incremental lines in both the enamel
23 and dentine can be seen along the same length of enamel-dentine junction in this specimen,
24 and lines of the same colour indicate equivalent daily lines in the dentine and enamel. Scale Commented [RO27]: Equivalent dentine and enamel
lines are now indicated, as suggested by Reviewer 3.

29 Raw growth rates: average daily secretion rate (µm/day) vs. average crown extension rate
30 (µm/day). B) Body mass corrected growth rates: the residuals of log daily secretion rate
31 (µm/day) and log crown extension rate (µm/day) following phylogenetic generalised least
32 squares regression against log body mass. the standardised residuals of average daily
33 secretion rate (µm/day) and of average crown extension rate (µm/day) following linear
34 regression against log body mass. The growth rates of individual teeth were included as
35 separate data points, rather than using the species average.

13 Analysis of the differences between five groups of amniotes in two enamel growth rate
14 variables, DSR and CER. DSR and CER were calculated assuming a 2-day periodicity between
15 long-period lines in non-mammalian cynodonts. A) MANOVA comparing DSR and CER (both
16 body mass corrected using phylogenetic generalised least squares regression and
17 transformed) across the five groups, with pairwise comparison p-values adjusted by FDR. B)
18 Separate univariate ANOVAs on DSR and CER (both body mass corrected using phylogenetic
19 generalised least squares regression and transformed) across the five groups, with pairwise
20 comparison p-values adjusted by FDR. Exaeretodon and Irajatherium were excluded from
21 this analysis.
