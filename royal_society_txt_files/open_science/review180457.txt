This paper investigates the feasibility for electricity production by MFC from ethanol stillage of
food waste, also studied the microbial structure in the system. The topic is pretty interest. The
methods are novel, and the results are important, and overall, both of which were presented
satisfactorily. The data and results lead to a better understanding the effect and processes
mechanisms. I would like to recommend this paper be accepted for publication in your journal
after revision.
1. On Title: The authors should consider to edit the title, and I suggest it be as “Effect of
fermentation stillage of food waste on bioelectricity production and microbial community
structure in microbial fuel cells ”.
2. On Introduction: The authors should consider to present the prospective audience a more
better background information on waste recycling, for example, infomation in the following
articles: Pandey et al., Applied Energy, 2016, 168: 706-723; Wu et al., International
Biodeterioration & Biodegradation, 2017, 119: 429-436; Wu et al., Environmental Science and

142(9): C40150; Peng et al., Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 2014, 98(15): 6847-6858.
3. The results of high-throughput sequencing show that the electrochemically active
microorganisms are not the dominant strain. The authors should explain more on the reasons.
4. On “3.5 Microbial community structure of anode and cathode biofilms”: The authors are
suggested to compare biofilm development in MFCs with those in other reactors, for example,
those descripted or summarized by Suidan et al. (Water Science and Technology, 2003, 48(8): 89-
96), and by Yang et al. (Biotechnology Advances, 2010, 28(4): 531-540).
5. On Fig.4: The authors should explain more on the reasons that TOC is lower before MFC
treatment and higher after MFC treatment than COD.
6. The authors should consider to present data on the microbial community in MFCs fed with
pure substance, or discuss more in the context of literature. Are there any differences among
different substances? The authors are suggested to cite this publication in this topic: Pandey et
al., Applied Energy, 2016, 168: 706-723.
7. The authors should edit this manuscript more carefully.

The manuscript entitled “Effect of food waste ethanol fermentation stillage on bioelectricity
production from microbial fuel cells and its microbial community structure” by Ma et al.
describes the use of a single-chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC) to treat recycled stillage obtained
from food-waste ethanol-fermentation. Basically, this study was performed decently and well
organized. However, after careful evaluation, a major concern of this study is its novelty. Using
MFC for treating wastes or wastewater has been studied for decades. Different sources of
inoculum and different kind of wastes or wastewater would of course results in different energy
outputs. Without a detail study on their potential mechanisms would make this kind of studies
become routine. It is a pity that this study did observed some interesting phenomena but didn’t
go a step further to dig out their mechanisms. Therefore, with regrets, I may not be able to
recommend it for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

Appendix A
To whom it may concern,
We are submitting our manuscript with entitled " Effect of
fermentation stillage of food waste on bioelectricity production and
microbial community structure in microbial fuel cells”. It has words of
involves text (24pages), including 6 Figures and 1 table and reply to
the reviewers (6 pages).
All the authors agreed to publish the paper in “Royal Society Open
Science”. The manuscript is original work of authors, and has not been
submitted earlier to RSC Advances, this paper has never been
contributed simultaneously to any other journals.
This article used a single-chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC) to treat
recycled stillage obtained from food waste ethanol fermentation.
Corresponding TOC and COD removal efficiency exceeded 50% and
70%, respectively. Microbial community analysis by high-throughput
sequencing indicated that Advenella and Moheibacter occupied the
highest proportion among all genera at the anode instead of Geobacter.
The complicated accumulated components in stillage and potential
tetracyclines possibly influenced microbial communities.
We would be grateful if the manuscript can be reviewed and
considered for publication in “Royal Society Open Science”.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely yours,
Hongzhi Ma

One of the revived bio-electrochemical concept and
promising technology that is proposed to address these
aspects is microbial fuel cell (MFC), which principally
produce electricity from the anaerobic oxidation of
biodegradable organic substrates(Pandey et al., 2016).

Advenella exerted an inhibitory effect on Geobacter.
Composition of stillage was complicated, and accumulation
of harmful substances possibly induced inhibition. Stillage
presents low oxidation reduction potential and therefore
cannot produce an appropriate environment for Geobacter
