Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In this article Skinner et al presented the results of a study to investigate whether smoking affects
attractiveness of the face and whether the latter can be use to predict smoking status. The authors
used sets of prototype photos from identical twins who were discordant for smoking status and
asked volunteers (n=~580) to choose who was more attractive (Task1) or to choose who of the
twin pair was a smoker. The volunteers were recruited via a website. The authors used binomial
exact test to test for deviations of the null hypothesis of 50% chance of choosing either individual
of the pair as the attractive one. Using these prototype profiles the authors found that volunteers
selected more often the non-smoker as the attractive one (Task 1) (0.28 for male volunteers and
0.30 for females volunteers, respectively). The authors also found that volunteers more often
assigned the right smoking status to the individual of the twin pair (Task 2; 0.70 for both male
and female volunteers). The authors concluded that smoking affects the appearance of the skin
and that skin appearance can be used as a predictor of smoking status.
I have several questions about the study design and analysis.
1) The authors made four prototype photographs, namely: female smoker ,female non-smoker,
male smoker and male non-smoker using software to eliminate individual variations of light or
other technical variations. Using these prototypes the authors found significant deviations from
the null hypothesis of 50% chance. I wonder if the use of the software did not make the contrast
between smoker and non-smoker already so large that it was easy for the participant to score the
non-smoker as more attractive. In line with this, the results of the analysis of the exemplars
seemed more conservative than the one obtained from the prototype photos. Could the authors
comment on it?
2) In the methods the authors mentioned that every participant did 25 trials per task. If they were
about 580 participants per task that would mean that the data consisted of a file of 25 columns
and 580 rows (or 580 columns and 25 rows) with zeros and ones. However it is not clear to me
what the authors reported as mean response in the results section (mean response 0.28,
corresponding to 72%). Did the average four different mean responses (meaning per prototype?).
Could the authors clarify this? Why they use one test for the prototypes and another one for the
exemplar photographs? How the confidence interval s for the binomial tests were calculated?
This information is missing in the methods.
3) I am not sure that the author’s statement that the appearance is a marker of smoking status can
be made. It is well known that smokers have a worse life style than non-smokers. So looking less
attractive would not be the effect of only smoking but all associated life-style. Although the
authors reported similar profiles of risk factors associated with skin aging including BMI and
alcohol use between smokers and non-smokers, the authors did not correct for any of these
variables in the analysis. Could the authors comment on this?
4) Last but not least. An important caveat of this study is that the smoking status alone may be
not sufficient to investigate this question. Did the authors investigate how much did the twins
smoke? I would imagine that 1 or 2 cigarettes per day won’t make much difference. Could the
authors comment on this?
Minor comments
1) In the abstract the authors should mentioned the method they used.
2) The second paragraph of the introduction looks more like results.
3) The methods need to be clearer (at least the statistical analysis).
4) I would like to see the actual confidence intervals (The authors only provided bars which do
not really mean much in figure 2).
5) For clarity, it would be nice if the authors also provide footnotes to the figures of
supplementary material (red, green). Does the first bar of supplementary 1 mean that less than
3
10% of volunteers rate the smoker twins as attractive? Can the authors clarify this? Why the
authors have the a dotted line at 60%? Should not this be at 50%? This is confusing.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
Overall, I thought this was an excellently written paper conducted and reported to the highest
scientific standards. The topic was innovative and the results will be of interest to the tobacco
control research community and designers of interventions of smoking cessation.
I would find it useful to have stats results and indication of effect size in abstract results, if
possible.
The introduction was excellent. Concise and built the case for the research questions
convincingly.
Typo: heading for Table 1 should read ‘additional’.
Materials section: If 20 of the 23 twinsets were female, does this mean that male prototype was
derived from just three exemplars? Can the authors make this clear, and if this is true, can they
refer to any literature as to whether three is a suitable number to develop the male prototype? NB
- after reading the discussion, it’s clear this was the case and it’s suitably acknowledged.
However, I think it would be helpful to make this number clear in the material section, and also
to refer to literature (if it exists) that recommends the minimum number of exemplars that would
be used ideally to form prototype.
Participants: power analysis suggested 630 participants (315 female) would be recruited in each
task and yet recruitment stopped early in each case. Could the authors add a sentence in
discussion or results to explain – related to unexpected exclusions?
Creating prototypes section: Was the process of developing the smoker and non-smoker
prototypes conducted by a blinded experimenter? If not, is the process of developing the
4
prototype sufficiently automated/free of researcher degrees of freedom for this to be a minor
concern?
Analysis section: the primary analysis listed in the protocol v1 on OSF is the analysis provided in
the supplementary materials, and I could see no mention of the prototypes or the intended
analysis of them. It’s possible v1 was amended and I’m viewing the wrong version on OSF. I infer
that the amendment was a priori since the prototype stimuli were evidently included in the
experiment. Perhaps the authors could add an explanatory note?
Supplementary materials. Worth including Bayes factors based on power calculation to help
interpretation of failing to reject null?

This was an interesting study and I enjoyed reading the paper. My queries and concerns are
detailed below.
ABSTRACT
For the most part the abstract does a good job of summarising the study. However, I found the
description of the findings a little confusing (see my comments re. results). I wonder if it would
be possible to clarify this (both here and in results).
INTRODUCTION
The Introduction is effective but very short. This is reasonable as this research question is not
underpinned by a very large body of research. However, I think it would be enhanced by further
information about the heritability of smoking and the MZ differences design. For instance, the
rationale for the study - and perhaps for the number of discordant twin sets available - would be
stronger if we knew MZ concordance rates / e2 estimates for smoking.
METHOD
It was good to see that this study was pre-registered with the Open Science Framework. Initially
I was unsure why the use of prototypes was not included at this stage. You justify this later in
the paper but it might be worth addressing it straight away.
I would have liked you to explicitly explain why each participant was only asked to complete one
of the tasks. Also, did they get to choose which task they completed? In your Discussion you say
that in fact some participants may have done both. How could this have arisen i.e. what systems
did you have in place to avoid this?
On page 9, line 5, there is an 'i' missing from 'participant'.
Your sample size was appropriate, even after exclusions, and this is explained well.
RESULTS
I may be being dense here but these findings are confusing to me. I would really appreciate a
more detailed explanation of the different rationale and expectations for analyses by twin set and
analyses by participant. One set of analyses finds that smoking twins are no more likely to (a) be
perceived as smokers or (b) be seen as less attractive than their non-smoking co-twins. The
contradiction between this and the second (by participant) set of results is (for me) hard to
fathom. You do address it in paragraph 1 of your Discussion but I remain a little nonplussed. I
would appreciate further explanation and the presentation of a more compelling case for why
this makes sense.
DISCUSSION
Just a thought but is it possible that participants do better with prototypes than twin sets because
'smoking features' are more exaggerated in the prototypes?
Thanks again for an interesting manuscript.

Appendix A
Dear Professor Padian,
Thank you for the review comments for our manuscript, and for the opportunity to submit a revision.
We include below detailed responses to the points raised by the reviewers.
We particularly thank Reviewer 2 for spotting an inconsistency with our pre-registered study protocol.
The use of prototype, averaged faces was initially included in early drafts of our protocol, but was
removed in error before the protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework. This was an
honest mistake on our part, and we apologise for this. The use of the prototypes is clearly an
important element of our study, and we are keen to resolve this issue in a way that is in the spirit of
Open Science. As such, we propose re-working the manuscript so that it better reflects the registered
protocol, by including the exemplar results and analyses in the main manuscript rather than
Supplementary Materials, and making clear that the use of prototypes was not pre-registered in the
study protocol. We have made these changes in the revised manuscript. While they alter the body of
the manuscript somewhat, and we have been slightly more cautious in the way we present the
findings from the exemplar twin sets, they do not result in any substantial or qualitative changes to
the overall conclusions of the article, which are based on the prototype faces. This is a summary of the
changes made to address this issue –
i) Throughout: Labels for Task 1 and 2 swapped to align manuscript with protocol.
ii) Abstract (page 2): Minor changes to include use and results of exemplars.
iii) Introduction (pages 3 and 4): Last two paragraphs re-ordered to introduce use of prototypes.
iv) Design (page 5): Details of pre-registration updated to make clear use of prototypes was not pre-
registered.
v) Statistical Analysis section (pages 9 and 10): Updated to include analyses of exemplars.
vi) Results section (pages 11-14): Updated to include results of exemplars.
vii) Discussion (pages 17 and 18): First four paragraphs updated to discuss exemplar results and use
of prototypes.
viii) Supplementary Materials: Removed, as all information now in main manuscript.
We hope you agree this is an acceptable way forward. Apologies again for any inconvenience this
causes yourself and the reviewers.
Best regards,
Andy Skinner

1) The authors made four prototype photographs, namely: female smoker, female non-smoker, male
smoker and male non-smoker using software to eliminate individual variations of light or other
technical variations. Using these prototypes the authors found significant deviations from the null
hypothesis of 50% chance. I wonder if the use of the software did not make the contrast between
smoker and non-smoker already so large that it was easy for the participant to score the non-smoker
as more attractive. In line with this, the results of the analysis of the exemplars seemed more
conservative than the one obtained from the prototype photos. Could the authors comment on it?
Yes, there are two important points to note here:
Firstly, the process for producing the prototypes is in no way influenced by information about lifestyles
(e.g. smoking status). The exemplar faces are delineated with fiducial points that identify specific
facial features (e.g. outline of face, centres of pupils), and this delineation process is identical for
every exemplar for every prototype. The averaging process is then entirely automatic, and simply
applies the shape, colour and texture averaging transformations to collections of marked-up faces,
using no information about the individual themselves. Consequently, we would suggest any differences
between prototypes reflect real differences in appearance between the groups of exemplar faces used
to produce those prototypes (smoking status in this case), and that these differences are not
introduced, influenced or exaggerated in any way during the prototyping process as a result of
knowledge about lifestyles. We have extended our description in the Creating Prototypes section on
page 7 to make this clear.
Secondly, as the reviewer points out, the results for the exemplars (which we have now been moved
into the main manuscript to address Reviewer 2’s point 6) were more conservative than those for the
prototypes. As we have described in the Discussion on page 14, comparing exemplar sets is made
difficult because even small differences in pose, lighting and expression between twins in a set can
impact judgements of facial appearance. This was our rationale for using prototypes, as described in
the last paragraph of the Introduction on pages 3 and 4.
2) In the methods the authors mentioned that every participant did 25 trials per task. If they were
about 580 participants per task that would mean that the data consisted of a file of 25 columns and
580 rows (or 580 columns and 25 rows) with zeros and ones. However it is not clear to me what the
authors reported as mean response in the results section (mean response 0.28, corresponding to
72%). Did the average four different mean responses (meaning per prototype?). Could the authors
clarify this? Why they use one test for the prototypes and another one for the exemplar photographs?
How the confidence interval s for the binomial tests were calculated? This information is missing in the
methods.
Yes, this is essentially how the data file is formatted, with the exception that for each twin set there
are two columns – one for the twin set number and one for the participant’s response for that twin set
(0 = the non-smoking twin was selected, 1 = the smoking twin was selected). Prototypes are treated
as twin sets in the data file: twin set 1 is the male prototypes and twin set 2 is the female prototypes.
For each prototype set, the mean response was calculated by summing the participant responses in
the column for that prototype set and dividing by the total number of participants. We have clarified
this with additional text in the Statistical Analysis section on pages 8 and 9.
Different analyses were performed for prototypes and exemplars as these were asking different
questions. For the prototypes, we averaged smoking and non-smoking exemplars to make the
prototype sets, and we were interested in how participants chose between the two prototypes in each
set. For the exemplars, we were interested in how participants responded across a number of
exemplar sets (e.g. all female twin sets), and this requires a different kind of analysis.
95% confidence intervals for the binomial tests were calculated using:
CI = 1.96*sqrt[p(1-p) / n]
where p = mean response and n = number of participant responses
We have included this in the Statistical Analysis section on page 8.
3) I am not sure that the author’s statement that the appearance is a marker of smoking status can
be made. It is well known that smokers have a worse life style than non-smokers. So looking less
attractive would not be the effect of only smoking but all associated life-style. Although the authors
reported similar profiles of risk factors associated with skin aging including BMI and alcohol use
between smokers and non-smokers, the authors did not correct for any of these variables in the
analysis. Could the authors comment on this?
Now that we have included both the exemplars and prototypes in the main manuscript, to maintain
clarity and avoid redundancy, we would need an approach for correcting for these factors that would
work for both. One approach to correcting for these factors would be to use logistic regression.
However, with just 4 prototype sets, the total number of observations would be too few for logistic
regression to operate reliably (see Peduzzi P, Concato J, Kemper E, Holford TR, Feinstein AR (1996). A
simulation study of the number of events per variable in logistic regression analysis. Journal of Clinical
Epidemiology. 49 (12): 1373–9).
We would respectfully suggest that presenting these additional lifestyle data in the current format
offers greatest clarity in interpreting the results for exemplars and prototypes. We certainly agree that
looking for differences in these factors is important though, and have strengthened our analyses of
group differences in these factors by performing Bayesian paired sample t-tests for each factor, and
presenting the Bayes factors for these in Table 1. These support the findings from the original
statistical tests, in showing no evidence for differences in any of the lifestyle factors between the
smoking and non-smoking groups (if anything, they offer evidence for no differences between the
groups).
4) Last but not least. An important caveat of this study is that the smoking status alone may be not
sufficient to investigate this question. Did the authors investigate how much did the twins smoke? I
would imagine that 1 or 2 cigarettes per day won’t make much difference. Could the authors comment
on this?
Unfortunately, given the small number of exemplars available for this study, the analyses necessary to
explore this in detail would be considerably underpowered. However, we agree this is one of several
interesting questions that could be addressed in follow-on studies if more exemplars are available. We
have therefore included this as a limitation and a suggestion for future studies in the Discussion on
page 16.
Minor comments:
i) In the abstract the authors should mentioned the method they used.
Unfortunately, the word limit for the Method is very tight, and we don’t have room for any more detail,
but we have added clarification to the Method section as requested.
ii) The second paragraph of the introduction looks more like results.
We have reworked this paragraph to remove some of the numbers (without impacting the message),
so that it looks less like results.
iii) The methods need to be clearer (at least the statistical analysis).
As described above in points 1 and 2, we have added additional text to help clarify both the Creating
Prototypes and Statistical Analysis sections.
iv) I would like to see the actual confidence intervals (The authors only provided bars which do not
really mean much in figure 2).
Now that we have included exemplar results with confidence intervals in the main manuscript, there
are many more confidence intervals. We would suggest reporting these in the text of the manuscript is
a duplication, though if the Editor thinks necessary, we would be happy to include these, perhaps in
Supplementary Materials.
v) For clarity, it would be nice if the authors also provide footnotes to the figures of supplementary
material (red, green). Does the first bar of supplementary 1 mean that less than 10% of volunteers
rate the smoker twins as attractive? Can the authors clarify this? Why the authors have the a dotted
line at 60%? Should not this be at 50%? This is confusing.
We have moved these figures into the main manuscript and added information to clarify in the figure
legends. The dotted line should be at 50% - this was probably an error in converting to PDF. We
believe this is now corrected.
Reviewer: 2
1) I would find it useful to have stats results and indication of effect size in abstract results, if
possible.
In addressing point 6 below, we have moved the exemplar results and analyses into the main
manuscript. This has placed even more pressure on the very limited word count for the abstract, and
unfortunately, we have not been able to include details of results in the abstract.
2) Typo: heading for Table 1 should read ‘additional’.
Thank you – we’ve corrected this.
3) Materials section: If 20 of the 23 twinsets were female, does this mean that male prototype was
derived from just three exemplars? Can the authors make this clear, and if this is true, can they refer
to any literature as to whether three is a suitable number to develop the male prototype? NB - after
reading the discussion, it’s clear this was the case and it’s suitably acknowledged. However, I think it
would be helpful to make this number clear in the material section, and also to refer to literature (if it
exists) that recommends the minimum number of exemplars that would be used ideally to form
prototype.
As suggested, we have added details of the number of exemplars used to make the prototypes to the
Creating Prototypes section on page 7. And in the Discussion (page 16) we have included a reference
to a previous study exploring attractiveness of prototypes, which we think is a good starting point for
identifying the minimum number of exemplars to use to make a prototype.
4) Participants: power analysis suggested 630 participants (315 female) would be recruited in each
task and yet recruitment stopped early in each case. Could the authors add a sentence in discussion or
results to explain – related to unexpected exclusions?
Yes, we’ve added a brief section to the Results/Participants section on page 10 to explain.
5) Creating prototypes section: Was the process of developing the smoker and non-smoker prototypes
conducted by a blinded experimenter? If not, is the process of developing the prototype sufficiently
automated/free of researcher degrees of freedom for this to be a minor concern?
A good point. We’ve addressed this is response to Reviewer 1’s point 1. In summary, the processes
used to produce the prototypes are sufficiently automated for there to be no scope for researchers to
influence this in any meaningful way. We have updated the Creating Prototypes section on page 7 of
the manuscript to clarify this.
6) Analysis section: the primary analysis listed in the protocol v1 on OSF is the analysis provided in
the supplementary materials, and I could see no mention of the prototypes or the intended analysis of
them. It’s possible v1 was amended and I’m viewing the wrong version on OSF. I infer that the
amendment was a priori since the prototype stimuli were evidently included in the experiment.
Perhaps the authors could add an explanatory note?
Thank you for spotting this issue. This was an error on our part, and we have addressed as detailed
above in our response to the editor.
7) Supplementary materials. Worth including Bayes factors based on power calculation to help
interpretation of failing to reject null?
We have included Bayesian analyses for the exemplars, which we have moved to the Results section
of the main manuscript, on pages 10 and 11.
Appendix B
Dear Professor Viding,
Many thanks for accepting our article for publication in Royal Society Open Science. Thanks also for the
helpful comments and suggestions. We have addressed each of the points raised below. I would also like
to draw your attention to two points in particular if I may.
Firstly, in response to the reviewers’ comments that the findings of most interest are those relating to
prototypes, we have suggested modifying the title of the article slightly so that it is now ‘Smoking status
and attractiveness among exemplar and prototypical identical twins discordant for smoking’.
Secondly, on further examination of the consenting procedures for this study, it appears that, because
the study began some time ago before our lab had put in place procedures to support full open access to
data, we unfortunately do not have consent to make the data for this study fully open. We are, however,
able to make the data freely available from our institutional data repository on request. We have
therefore amended the text in the manuscript to refer readers to this repository, and have included a
DOI for the data (p10 para 2).
We hope these changes meet with your agreement, and look forward to hearing from you shortly.
Best regards,
Andy Skinner

1. I recommend noting clearly in para1 of the discussion which bits of the results match the pre-reg
protocol and which do not.
We have made clear which analyses were pre-registered and which were not in the beginning of the first
and second paragraphs of the Discussion (p14).
Reviewer: 1
2. The authors replied to my previous comments. However, from the results it is clear that the main
conclusion that attractiveness can be used to predict smoking behaviour is only valid for the prototype
photos. Therefore I really doubt that this has a clinical or behavioral impact.
We have updated the Abstract (p2 para4) and Conclusion (p17 para2) to make clear that the findings
from this study with greatest potential for informing behaviour change interventions are those relating to
the prototypes. We have also updated the title of the article to include reference to prototypes to reflect
that they were an important part of the study.
Reviewer: 3
3. (Abstract) For the most part the abstract does a good job of summarising the study. However, I found
the description of the findings a little confusing (see my comments re. results). I wonder if it would be
possible to clarify this (both here and in results).
Hopefully the changes to the description of the analyses and rationale for these in the Statistical Analysis
section (p9) have helped clarify this. We have also re-ordered the results section (p10-11) and reworked
the discussion of the findings slightly (p14 para 1).
4. (Introduction) The Introduction is effective but very short. This is reasonable as this research question
is not underpinned by a very large body of research. However, I think it would be enhanced by further
information about the heritability of smoking and the MZ differences design. For instance, the rationale
for the study - and perhaps for the number of discordant twin sets available - would be stronger if we
knew MZ concordance rates / e2 estimates for smoking.
We have added additional text to the Introduction to describe use of twin studies to determine
heritability of smoking, and explain the utility of twin studies in the current context (p3 para2).
5. (Method) It was good to see that this study was pre-registered with the Open Science Framework.
Initially I was unsure why the use of prototypes was not included at this stage. You justify this later in
the paper but it might be worth addressing it straight away.
We have added text to the end of the Introduction (p4 para1) to address this point at the beginning of
the article.
6. (Method) I would have liked you to explicitly explain why each participant was only asked to complete
one of the tasks. Also, did they get to choose which task they completed? In your Discussion you say
that in fact some participants may have done both. How could this have arisen i.e. what systems did you
have in place to avoid this?
We have added text (p5 para1) to explain that we used separate groups of participants for each task to
prevent demand characteristics influencing task performance. Participants did not get to choose tasks –
the tasks were made available on Prolific Academic at different times. We have added text to the
Discussion (p17 para2) to explain how completion of both tasks could have happened, and what should
be done in future to prevent this.
7. (Method) On page 9, line 5, there is an 'i' missing from 'participant'.
Thank you – we have corrected this.
8. (Results) I may be being dense here but these findings are confusing to me. I would really appreciate
a more detailed explanation of the different rationale and expectations for analyses by twin set and
analyses by participant. One set of analyses finds that smoking twins are no more likely to (a) be
perceived as smokers or (b) be seen as less attractive than their non-smoking co-twins. The
contradiction between this and the second (by participant) set of results is (for me) hard to fathom. You
do address it in paragraph 1 of your Discussion but I remain a little nonplussed. I would appreciate
further explanation and the presentation of a more compelling case for why this makes sense.
We have added additional text to the Statistical Analysis section (p9 para1) to describe these two
approaches and the rationale for using them. We have also made changes to the discussion of the
results of these analyses in the Discussion (p14 para1) to help clarify interpretation.
9. (Discussion) Just a thought but is it possible that participants do better with prototypes than twin sets
because 'smoking features' are more exaggerated in the prototypes?
In our opinion, with exemplars differences in facial appearance between smokers and non-smokers can
be masked by variations in factors that are difficult to control (e.g., lighting, pose, etc). The averaging
process essentially controls for many of these factors, and enables any differences in appearance due to
smoking to be more visible. Therefore, the smoking features are not exaggerated but are presented
after controlling for other factors. We have updated the wording of the Discussion (p14 para2) to
hopefully make this clear.
