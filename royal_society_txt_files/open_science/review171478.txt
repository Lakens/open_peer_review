This paper examines the interaction between regulatory focus and urban context prime. It
documents that under a big-city prime, promotion orientation is associated with a liberal bias in
the signal detection task, whereas prevention orientation is associated with a conservative bias.
However, under a small-city prime, individual differences of regulatory focus orientations are
insignificant. Overall, I think the finding is robust, but I have a few fundamental concerns on the
framing of the paper and the presentation of the regulatory focus theory.
1) First, I encourage the authors to review two articles that studied regulatory focus orientations
in the context of signal detection paradigms. The current paper should build on directly on these
two pieces.

2) The development of the group level regulatory focus effect is unnecessary and irrelevant. First,
it is not clear at all why the big vs. small urban context is related to promotion and prevention
orientations. Second, different contextual primes can entail different regulatory fit with the two
systems, without changing individuals’ regulatory systems (see Higgins, E. T. (2000). Making a
good decision: Value from fit. American Psychologist, 55(11), 1217–1230.) Importantly, your
research is essentially at the individual level.
3) The conceptualization of the urban context prime is not clear to me at all. What does the prime
entail? It could suggest so many things. For example, it might entail tightness vs. loss culture.

Please clarify how you infer the psychological meaning of the urban contextual prime. I’ll also
recommend you to conduct a pilot test to verify your theorization.
4) In the manuscript, you repeatedly assert that “people living in large cities behave differently
than those living in small cities.” How? On what meaningful dimensions? Of course, they would
have to behave differently in many ways as different environments afford different behaviors.
Which elements of the urban context that you seek to study? Is it the total population? the
density? Are you holding the national cultural environment constant? Further, what are the other
empirical findings that directly speak to your statement? The literature review needs to be more
precise and directly relevant to the hypotheses that you’re building.
Thank you for the opportunity to review your manuscript. Good luck with the further

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript poses a very interesting and important question: "Why do people in large cities
behave differently than those living in small cities?" There is a large literature studying outcomes
of the way people behave (crime, disease, income, etc.), but not behavior itself. Hence, the
question is interesting in that it aims at bridging results from sociology, economics, geography,
and complex systems disciplines, with results from psychology. The overview they present of the
studies related to "Regulatory Focus Theory", and how groups of people have also a regulatory
focus that affects the behavior of the individuals, is interesting and should be very informative to
scholars interested in understanding cities and urban phenomena. The manuscript is concise and
well-written.
The authors present their theory, which is that cities have, as a collective, a systemic regulatory
focus that affects the behavior of their individuals. In other words, they claim that the behavior of
individuals is determined by both an inherent regulatory focus, and an urban-induced regulatory
focus. The focus in both cases can be promotion-oriented or prevention-oriented. They then
explain their experimental design, and what they expect from it. They perform some simple
analyses of their results, which they claim stand as supportive evidence of their hypothesis.
I have, however, a number of general (more philosophical) and specific (more methodological)
concerns:
1) The first question is about the logic behind the assumption that large cities are more
"promotion-focused". While it is empirically true that larger cities have higher wages, more crime,
more diseases, more innovation, etc., the authors seem to immediately assume that this is
evidence of "promotion-focus" dynamics. This is a circular logic, and I would claim, is a circular
definition: "the pace of life in larger cities is faster because larger cities are promotion-focus, and
they are promotion-focus because the pace of life is faster". The authors say that "the dynamics of
the city gives rise to an urban regulatory focus, which in turn affects the city's dynamics and so
on in circular causality". But the collective trait which they are trying to propose, the "urban
regulatory focus" has to be clearly defined without invoking its effects. Otherwise, the risk is to
fall in circular thinking. This does not mean that the authors are wrong, but just that it would
4
benefit the reader if the authors more clearly explained what exactly is the collective level trait
they are proposing. How do you go to a city and measure it? How do you distinguish the
measurement of the "urban regulatory focus" of a city from the measurement of its effects (like
people walking and talking faster)? References the authors may find interesting (in case they
haven't read them yet) are all those from Jane Jacobs.
2) How would one falsify this theory? I fear there is a certain lack of concreteness in the
mechanisms behind the theory: Suppose I have my own "chronic" type of behavior, and I move
out to a large city. Suppose you measure a time later which type of regulatory focus I now have
acquired. Suppose I have changed my behavior (either to more promotion-oriented or more
preventive-oriented). How would you disprove the hypothesis that it was the city that changed
me? If I tell you that what changed me was my workplace environment, you'll answer me that
my workplace environment exists the way it is because of the city. And I can hardly think of an
argument that would discard the city in favor of another effect, given that almost all social
phenomena are urban. And if the urban effect is the sum of all lower-level effects (the regulatory
focus of the family, circle of friends, the workplace, the neighborhood), so what is the use of
proposing such general urban effect? At the end, the theory has a certain flavor for "explaining
everything", and thus, it has the flavor for being a bad scientific theory. Again, this is a point to
expand on in future writings.
3) More specific, there is a certain contradiction in the results presented, which would be nice if
the authors could elaborate or explain better: According to the experiment, promotion-focus cities
induce a reinforcement in both promotion-focus and prevention-focus individuals. Hence,
wouldn't this mean that cities that start as "promotion-focus", by the fact of increasing the
prevention-focused degree of many individuals, will become therefore less "promotion-focused"
cities?
4) The experiment is nice, but I have some concerns for the reach of its implications. Some
methodological considerations were missing that are typical of experimental designs such as this
one. Some of them include:
- power calculations undertaken to ensure that sample sizes were adequate to
test the hypothesis considered;
- descriptive statistics of the subjects (how many did "what" and responded "how"?);
- A discussion about the "internal validity" of the experiment;
- A discussion about the "external validity" of the experiment;
- A clear discussion for why the 3-minute video that the authors present to the subjects is the
most significant and representative collective trait to which individuals are exposed to when they
live in a city (for example, why did they remove the audio? The city is typically considered a
place of social interaction... in what sense a video substitutes urban interaction?);
- The authors did not publish the questionnaire used;
- They did not published the video of cities they presented to the experimental subjects.
5) Also on a methodological note, the reader would benefit from having the results presented in
regression tables. And the figures that are already in the manuscript should include standard
errors. It is difficult to properly assess causal effects in an experiment without a estimation of the
errors.
6) Another (minor) suggestion is to be careful about the images showed. A simple google search
revealed that one of them (Fig. 2) requires a permission to be shown
(http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-next-new-look-and-river-island-clothes-shops-along-
oxford-street-london-29897246.html). In general, I consider these photos completely unnecessary.
7) There finally a question about how would the authors reconcile their results with the results of
5
Arcaute, E., Hatna, E., Ferguson, P., Youn, H., Johansson, A., & Batty, M. (2015). Constructing
cities, deconstructing scaling laws. Journal of The Royal Society Interface, 12(102), 20140745, in
which they show that the urban scaling laws depend strongly on the spatial delineation of the
city boundaries. How come the delineation changes the behavioral effects of cities?
In conclusion, I think the paper contributes to the literature on cities with an important question.
Precisely because it is an important and deep question, the conceptual and experimental
framework they propose fall too short. Hope my comments are useful.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Anastasia Christakou):
Thank you for the opportunity to review your manuscript. I hope you find the reviewers'
comment helpful in improving the manuscript.
In summary, the reviewers felt that the treatment of the data was reasonable, but the theoretical
framing of the work needs significant improvement.
Of particular concern is the distance between the empirical paradigm employed and the broad
and under-specified constructs to which the data is purported to speak. The theory proposed is
not straightforwardly falsifiable, which significantly reduces its utility for the field.
One solution may be that the theoretical framework is reworked, embedded more coherently in
existing literature, and potentially reduced in scope so as to increase its specificity.
I hope you find this review process helpful in further developing your manuscript.

I appreciated very much all the work that went into the revision. My remaining question is to
clarify the sequence of the measurement. Does the measurement of chronic RFQ scale come
before or after the city prime? If it comes after the prime, please acknowledge that it is a major
limitation of the paper and the prime doesn't change the RFQ score.

ar Dr. Christakou,
would like to thank you for your comments. In keeping with your advice that “the theoretical
ming of the work needs significant improvement”, we have made a strategic decision from the
nt of view of our theoretical conceptualization. We have decided to omit the idea of
motion-focused cities and prevention-focused cities, and limit the scope of our theoretical
lysis to large cities and small cities. We agree with the reviewers that the logic of associating
e cities with a promotion focus is not straightforward, nor is the idea that a small city is a
vention-focused city. In future papers we will try to develop and reshape the concept of
motion-focused cities and prevention-focused cities. Thus, in the revised paper we talk about
urban context as a factor that can affect behavior of individuals living in cities. The context
nterest is that of a large city (instead of a promotion-focused city) and a small city (instead of
evention-focused city). By so doing, we shorten “the distance between the empirical
adigm employed and the broad and under-specified constructs to which the data are purported
peak” (in your words). Moreover, by reducing the scope of our theory, we believe that we
ke it easier to project from our empirical results to theoretical conclusions.
Below, you can find our response to the comments of the reviewers. We hope that you
l find our handling of the comments complete, and that you will find our paper suitable for
lication.

<U+F0B7> The development of the group level regulatory focus effect: in line with the reviewer’s
comment, this issue was omitted.
<U+F0B7> We agree with the reviewer that the logic of associating large cities with a promotion
focus is not straightforward, nor is the idea that a small city is a prevention-focused city.
Hence, we have made a strategic decision from the point of view of our theoretical
conceptualization. We have decided to omit the idea of promotion-focused cities and
prevention-focused cities, and limit the scope of our theoretical analysis to large cities
and small cities. In future papers we will try to develop and reshape the concept of
promotion-focused cities and prevention-focused cities. Thus, in the revised paper we
talk about the urban context as a factor that can affect behavior of individuals living in
cities. The context of interest is that of a large city (instead of a promotion-focused city)
and a small city (instead of a prevention-focused city).
mment 3
<U+F0B7> We hope that the decision to talk about large cities versus small cities (instead of
promotion-focused cities versus prevention-focused cites, respectively) makes it easier to
understand the priming procedure. In one video participants were exposed to a sequence
of scenes from a big, vibrant city (large streets, lots of people rushing here and there,
heavy traffic). In the other video, participants were exposed to scenes from a small, slow-
paced city (small streets, sparse traffic on the roads, people walking slowly). This is
exactly the urban context we are talking about – a big city context versus a small city
context.
<U+F0B7> The reviewer also recommends conducting a pilot test to verify our theorization, and
more specifically, the conceptualization of the urban context prime. So here is what we
did. Sixty-three student volunteers (other than the participants in the main study) took
part in a session in which each participant watched two videos (those that were used in
the main study). The first video (Video 1) depicted streets full of people, heavy traffic,
and the like (a big city context). The second video (Video 2) portrayed small streets,
sparse traffic, and the like (a small city context). Next, participants were asked for their
opinion about the two cities that were shown in the videos. The questions and the
percentage choosing each option are shown below. Statistical significance is denoted by
an asterisk.
1. In which city is the population larger?
Video 1 Video 2
[86]* [14] <U+03C7>2 (1) = 32.143, p < .01
2. In which city is the pace of life slower and more relaxed?
Video 1 Video 2
[3] [97]* <U+03C7>2 (1) = 55.254, p < .01
It can be seen that 86% of respondents associated Video 1 with a big-city context, which
means that they also associated Video 2 with a small-city context. Furthermore, 97% of
respondents associated Video 2 with a slow-paced urban context, which means that they
also associated Video 1 with a fast-paced urban context. Taken together, these findings
confirmed that both video clips were perceived by the participants as we meant them to
be perceived, thus strengthening the internal validity of our study. These results were
added to the revised manuscript.
mment 4
<U+F0B7> As to the question of how people behave differently in large versus small cities, the main
finding (and we talk about it in detail in our paper) is that people in large cities, produce
more, spend more, do more business, take more risks, work faster, walk faster, and in
general, pace of life is faster.
<U+F0B7> With respect to the question which elements of the urban context we seek to study, the
answer is that we decided to focus on city size and pace of life. More specifically, we
focused on big cities with a large population and a fast pace of life versus small cities
with a slow pace of life. Here it is worth emphasizing that pace of life in cities is
associated with city size. The bigger the city, the faster life is.
<U+F0B7> Regarding the comment about the national cultural environment – from an external
validity perspective, it is noteworthy that in the present work we focused on the North
American culture, and more specifically, on American cities and American way of life.
Thus, it has to be acknowledged that our findings might be limited in generalizability and
not be applicable to other cultures (e.g., Japanese cities and Japanese way of life). This
can be a direction for future research. A relevant comment has been added
<U+F0B7> Regarding the question about the other empirical findings that directly speak to our
statement, please refer to our statistical analysis, which is very detailed.
<U+F0B7> Regarding the literature review – we focused on regulatory focus theory at the individual
level in accordance with the reviewer’s comments to ignore irrelevant topics such as the
collective regulatory focus. Moreover, we limited our literature review to the impact of
city size and pace of life on behavior, while leaving other characteristics of the urban
context (such as the cultural environment) for future research.

mment 1
<U+F0B7> Here the reviewer talks about the logic behind the assumption that large cities are more
“promotion-focused”. In response to this comment, we agree with the reviewer that the
logic of associating large cities with a promotion focus is not straightforward, nor is the
idea that a small city is a prevention-focused city. Hence, we have made a strategic
decision from the point of view of our theoretical conceptualization. We have decided to
omit the idea of promotion-focused cities and prevention-focused cities, and limit the
scope of our theoretical analysis to large cities and small cities. In future papers we will
try to develop and reshape the concept of promotion-focused cities and prevention-
focused cities. Thus, in the revised paper we talk about the urban context as a factor that
can affect behavior of individuals living in cities. The context of interest is that of a large
city (instead of a promotion-focused city) and a small city (instead of a prevention-
focused city). Most importantly, by investigating how behavior is influenced by the urban
context (rather than by the city’s regulatory focus) we eliminate the problem of circular
thinking.
<U+F0B7> A reference to the classic book by Jane Jacobs (1961) has been made.
mment 2
<U+F0B7> Here the reviewer asks “How would one falsify the theory?” and further “…what is the
use of proposing such general urban effect?” The decision to focus on the impact of the
urban context (city size and pace of life) on behavior helps us, we believe, both to
overcome the obstacle of not being able to falsify our theory, and also to get over the
hurdle of dealing with too large a general urban effect. Since we talk about city size and
pace of life (for example, walking speed in the city streets), it becomes plausible to
falsify our ideas simply by examining the relation between the magnitude of population
on one hand, and promotion- and prevention-focused behavior (risk seeking versus risk
aversion) on the other hand, and also between walking speed and promotion- and
prevention-focused behavior. Thus, focusing on the urban context (city size, pace of life)
and its impact on behavior enables us to examine our hypotheses in a much narrower
perspective, and more importantly, this can be done irrespective of other aspects
mentioned by the reviewer, such as the workplace environment. In future papers, we plan
to analyze the impact of various urban phenomena on behavior, including economic
performance of cities (e.g. gross domestic product per capita), arts and culture (e.g.,
number of museums per population), and the like. An interesting question would be how
these aspects of urban life affect those living in a city, and as the reviewer said “this is a
point to expand on in future writings”.
mment 3
<U+F0B7> We refer to this comment but from the point of view of large cities versus small cities
(instead of promotion-focused cities versus prevention focused cities, respectively).
Presented is a conceptual framework for modeling the dynamic relationship between the
urban environment and the people living in it. We maintain that the way the city affects,
and is affected by, the city residents is a result of a causal interaction between the city
residents’ regulatory focus and the urban context. Our findings suggest that a large city
context encourages extreme and polarized behaviors. Vibrant cities with a large
population and a fast pace of life push individuals in a promotion focus to behave in a
more promotion-focused manner. But these cities also push individuals in a prevention
focus to behave in a more prevention-oriented manner. The former effect strengthens the
vibrant atmosphere of the city, whereas the latter weakens it. Here is why. When living in
a big, vibrant city, promotion-focused individuals, who are predisposed to take risk, take
even bigger risks (do more business, open more restaurants and bars, and the like). This
in turn intensifies the pace of life in the urban environment. However, prevention-focused
individuals, who are predisposed to avoid risk, show greater risk aversion, and if we
follow the rationale above, this slows down the pace of life in the urban environment.
Thus, in a city, there are two competing dynamics, one dominated by the effect of the
urban context on promotion-focused individuals, and another dominated by the effect of
the urban context on prevention-focused individuals. The interesting question is which of
the two dynamics will prevail. Here is what we suggest. Promotion-focused individuals
are attracted to and prefer to live in large and vibrant cities, whereas prevention-focused
individuals are attracted to and prefer to live in small and slow-paced cities. Thus, in big
cities the proportion of promotion-focused inhabitants is likely to be higher than that of
prevention-focused inhabitants, which is good enough a reason to conclude that the
prevailing dynamics would be the one dominated by the effect of the urban context on
promotion-focused individuals. This topic deserves further investigation, especially the
proposition that promotion-focused individuals prefer to live in big cities, whereas
prevention-focused ones prefer to live in small cities. It is noteworthy that we currently
have data from our lab that support this proposition. To summarize, if indeed the
prevailing dynamics in vibrant cities is the one between the urban context and promotion-
focused individuals, then, this may account for some of the more rampant and interesting
psycho-social phenomena in the cities of today. For example, this may explain why in
vibrant cities people take more risk, do more business, produce and spend more, and even
walk faster. This was added to the revised manuscript.

<U+F0B7> Regarding descriptive statistics: we had 201 participants, each of whom with their own
response bias. This cannot be summarized with how many did what and responded how,
because each response was unique to the responding individual. Excel worksheets with
all the data have been uploaded to the journal’s site. We would like to emphasize,
however, that in the Results section, the reviewer can find all the data that emerged from
the multiple regression analysis, simple slope analysis included, and also descriptive
statistics, based on median split procedure, aimed at illustrating the results of the
regression. All descriptive statistics are accompanied with relevant figures.
<U+F0B7> Internal validity: we emphasized four points in the revised paper regarding this issue.
First, the videos showed no features by which to identify the cities. We wanted to avoid
confounds due to preconceptions and stereotypes that could have biased the participants’
experience of the city. Second, the soundtrack (background music) was muted to avoid a
confounding effect due to priming modality. We wanted to make sure that the visual
information would be the sole priming means. In any other case, we would not have been
able to rule out the possibility that the music was responsible for any obtained
experimental effects. Third, the videos were downloaded from YouTube and no editing
was undertaken except for equating the duration of the streams (three minutes each).
Fourth (reported in the revised version of our paper), we conducted a pilot test to verify
the conceptualization of the urban context prime. Sixty-three student volunteers (other
than the participants in the main study) took part in a session in which each participant
watched two videos (those that were used in the main study). The first video (Video 1)
depicted streets full of people, heavy traffic, and the like (a big city context). The second
video (Video 2) portrayed small streets, sparse traffic, and the like (a small city context).
Next, participants were asked for their opinion about the two cities that were shown in the
videos. The questions and the percentage choosing each option are shown below.
Statistical significance is denoted by an asterisk.
1. In which city is the population larger?
Video 1 Video 2
[86]* [14] <U+03C7>2 (1) = 32.143, p < .01
2. In which city is the pace of life slower and more relaxed?
Video 1 Video 2
[3] [97]* <U+03C7>2 (1) = 55.254, p < .01
It can be seen that 86% of respondents associated Video 1 with a big-city context, which
means that they also associated Video 2 with a small-city context. Furthermore, 97% of
respondents associated Video 2 with a slow-paced urban context, which means that they
also associated Video 1 with a fast-paced urban context. Taken together, these findings
confirmed that both video clips were perceived by the participants as we meant them to
be perceived, thus strengthening the internal validity of our study. Of particular
importance, the data in the present study came from observations of behavior in a
manipulated urban context. A methodology based on experimental manipulation reduces
the possibility of alternative explanations and confounds in the study. Furthermore, as we
directly tested the hypothesized causal direction between urban context and behavior, our
methodology provides support for a causal account, namely, that the urban context was
responsible for the behavioral differences observed. By demonstrating that the urban
context affects the likelihood of one’s behaving in a promotion- or prevention-oriented
manner, the empirical findings reported here strongly support the concept that cities are
powerful regulatory systems, and as such they affect motivation and thus the way people
regulate their behavior.
<U+F0B7> From an external validity perspective, it is noteworthy that in the present work we
focused on the North American culture, and more specifically, on American cities and
American way of life. Thus, it has to be acknowledged that our findings might be limited
in generalizability and not be applicable to other cultures (e.g., Japanese cities and
Japanese way of life). This can be a direction for future research. We refer to this in our
revised paper. Furthermore, there is always the question whether data from a laboratory
experiment apply in the everyday real world. Our manipulation was based on video clips
that showed real cities and scenes from real life in a city (people walking in the streets,
shopping, sitting in a coffee shop, eating in a restaurant, drinking in a bar, and the like).
These scenes conveyed a real sense of either a vibrant city or a slow-paced city, which
was confirmed as described here above in the section on internal validity. We are
planning on a field study to further explore our ideas.
<U+F0B7> The video clips: We used a video-based experimental priming technique to make
participants momentarily experience either a big city context or a small city context. One
group was primed with a video showing large, busy streets full of people, heavy traffic,
high-rise luxury towers, arts and cultural events, street performances, fancy restaurants, a
vibrant night life scene, and in general a fast-paced, hectic urban environment. The
second group was primed with a video showing relatively small, tranquil streets, people
slowly walking while looking at display windows, some hanging out in local cafes, others
riding bicycles for recreation, and in general a slow-paced, leisurely urban setting. As
noted above, the soundtrack (background music) was muted to avoid a confounding
effect due to priming modality. We wanted to make sure that the visual information
would be the sole priming means. In any other case, we would not have been able to rule
out the possibility that the music was responsible for any obtained experimental effects.
These videos were not supposed to substitute for the urban interaction, but rather to make
participants momentarily experience a specific urban context, which they actually did
(see section on internal validity above).
<U+F0B7> The questionnaire: added to the revised manuscript. See Appendix.
<U+F0B7> Video clips: will be delivered upon request.

<U+F0B7> Presentation of the results – results from a multiple regression analysis (and a simple
slope analysis) are presented in our paper as many other papers do. For example, see
Higgins et al. (2001), and also Faddegon et al. (2008). Not only did we present the results
of the multiple regression analysis and simple slope analysis as most researchers do, but
we also illustrated the results using a median split procedure which is an additional means
of presenting the results to the readers. We do not use regression tables to present the
results, nor does Higgins in his papers.
<U+F0B7> Regarding the error bars in the figures, we would like to clarify: the analysis we based
our conclusions upon is the multiple regression. The figures were meant to make it easier
for the reader to understand the results. These figures are based on median split procedure
and as such they do not include error bars. These are just an illustration of the results. The
analysis readers should be focusing on is the multiple regression analysis and the simple
slope analysis where all data are presented.
mment 6
<U+F0B7> Photos have been removed.
mment 7
<U+F0B7> In our analysis of cities, we distinguish between a big city context and a small city
context. The former reflects on large, vibrant cities with a huge population and a fast pace
of life, whereas the latter on small cities with a slow pace of life. However, even large,
vibrant cities have relaxed and tranquil neighborhoods, generally in the outer circles of
the city. Thus, the urban context we talk about in the present work in the one that
represents the center of the city. It is the city center where differences in pace of life (if
exist) can be seen clearly. This point has been added to our revised paper.

more, spend more, do more business, take more risks, work faster, walk faster, and in
general, pace of life is faster.
<U+F0B7> With respect to the question which elements of the urban context we seek to study, the
answer is that we decided to focus on city size and pace of life. More specifically, we
focused on big cities with a large population and a fast pace of life versus small cities
with a slow pace of life. Here it is worth emphasizing that pace of life in cities is
associated with city size. The bigger the city, the faster life is.
<U+F0B7> Regarding the comment about the national cultural environment – from an external
validity perspective, it is noteworthy that in the present work we focused on the North
American culture, and more specifically, on American cities and American way of life.
Thus, it has to be acknowledged that our findings might be limited in generalizability and
not be applicable to other cultures (e.g., Japanese cities and Japanese way of life). This
can be a direction for future research. A relevant comment has been added
<U+F0B7> Regarding the question about the other empirical findings that directly speak to our
statement, please refer to our statistical analysis, which is very detailed.
<U+F0B7> Regarding the literature review – we focused on regulatory focus theory at the individual
level in accordance with the reviewer’s comments to ignore irrelevant topics such as the
collective regulatory focus. Moreover, we limited our literature review to the impact of
city size and pace of life on behavior, while leaving other characteristics of the urban
context (such as the cultural environment) for future research.

<U+F0B7> Here the reviewer talks about the logic behind the assumption that large cities are more
“promotion-focused”. In response to this comment, we agree with the reviewer that the
logic of associating large cities with a promotion focus is not straightforward, nor is the
idea that a small city is a prevention-focused city. Hence, we have made a strategic
decision from the point of view of our theoretical conceptualization. We have decided to
omit the idea of promotion-focused cities and prevention-focused cities, and limit the
scope of our theoretical analysis to large cities and small cities. In future papers we will
try to develop and reshape the concept of promotion-focused cities and prevention-
focused cities. Thus, in the revised paper we talk about the urban context as a factor that
can affect behavior of individuals living in cities. The context of interest is that of a large
city (instead of a promotion-focused city) and a small city (instead of a prevention-
focused city). Most importantly, by investigating how behavior is influenced by the urban
context (rather than by the city’s regulatory focus) we eliminate the problem of circular
thinking.
<U+F0B7> A reference to the classic book by Jane Jacobs (1961) has been made.

<U+F0B7> Here the reviewer asks “How would one falsify the theory?” and further “…what is the
use of proposing such general urban effect?” The decision to focus on the impact of the
urban context (city size and pace of life) on behavior helps us, we believe, both to
overcome the obstacle of not being able to falsify our theory, and also to get over the
hurdle of dealing with too large a general urban effect. Since we talk about city size and
pace of life (for example, walking speed in the city streets), it becomes plausible to
falsify our ideas simply by examining the relation between the magnitude of population
on one hand, and promotion- and prevention-focused behavior (risk seeking versus risk
aversion) on the other hand, and also between walking speed and promotion- and
prevention-focused behavior. Thus, focusing on the urban context (city size, pace of life)
and its impact on behavior enables us to examine our hypotheses in a much narrower
perspective, and more importantly, this can be done irrespective of other aspects
mentioned by the reviewer, such as the workplace environment. In future papers, we plan
to analyze the impact of various urban phenomena on behavior, including economic
performance of cities (e.g. gross domestic product per capita), arts and culture (e.g.,
number of museums per population), and the like. An interesting question would be how
these aspects of urban life affect those living in a city, and as the reviewer said “this is a
point to expand on in future writings”.

<U+F0B7> We refer to this comment but from the point of view of large cities versus small cities
(instead of promotion-focused cities versus prevention focused cities, respectively).
Presented is a conceptual framework for modeling the dynamic relationship between the
urban environment and the people living in it. We maintain that the way the city affects,
and is affected by, the city residents is a result of a causal interaction between the city
residents’ regulatory focus and the urban context. Our findings suggest that a large city
context encourages extreme and polarized behaviors. Vibrant cities with a large
population and a fast pace of life push individuals in a promotion focus to behave in a
more promotion-focused manner. But these cities also push individuals in a prevention
focus to behave in a more prevention-oriented manner. The former effect strengthens the
vibrant atmosphere of the city, whereas the latter weakens it. Here is why. When living in
a big, vibrant city, promotion-focused individuals, who are predisposed to take risk, take
even bigger risks (do more business, open more restaurants and bars, and the like). This
in turn intensifies the pace of life in the urban environment. However, prevention-focused
individuals, who are predisposed to avoid risk, show greater risk aversion, and if we
follow the rationale above, this slows down the pace of life in the urban environment.
Thus, in a city, there are two competing dynamics, one dominated by the effect of the
urban context on promotion-focused individuals, and another dominated by the effect of
the urban context on prevention-focused individuals. The interesting question is which of
the two dynamics will prevail. Here is what we suggest. Promotion-focused individuals
are attracted to and prefer to live in large and vibrant cities, whereas prevention-focused
individuals are attracted to and prefer to live in small and slow-paced cities. Thus, in big
cities the proportion of promotion-focused inhabitants is likely to be higher than that of
prevention-focused inhabitants, which is good enough a reason to conclude that the
prevailing dynamics would be the one dominated by the effect of the urban context on
promotion-focused individuals. This topic deserves further investigation, especially the
proposition that promotion-focused individuals prefer to live in big cities, whereas
prevention-focused ones prefer to live in small cities. It is noteworthy that we currently
have data from our lab that support this proposition. To summarize, if indeed the
prevailing dynamics in vibrant cities is the one between the urban context and promotion-
focused individuals, then, this may account for some of the more rampant and interesting
psycho-social phenomena in the cities of today. For example, this may explain why in
vibrant cities people take more risk, do more business, produce and spend more, and even
walk faster. This was added to the revised manuscript.

<U+F0B7> Regarding descriptive statistics: we had 201 participants, each of whom with their own
response bias. This cannot be summarized with how many did what and responded how,
because each response was unique to the responding individual. Excel worksheets with
all the data have been uploaded to the journal’s site. We would like to emphasize,
however, that in the Results section, the reviewer can find all the data that emerged from
the multiple regression analysis, simple slope analysis included, and also descriptive
statistics, based on median split procedure, aimed at illustrating the results of the
regression. All descriptive statistics are accompanied with relevant figures.
<U+F0B7> Internal validity: we emphasized four points in the revised paper regarding this issue.
First, the videos showed no features by which to identify the cities. We wanted to avoid
confounds due to preconceptions and stereotypes that could have biased the participants’
experience of the city. Second, the soundtrack (background music) was muted to avoid a
confounding effect due to priming modality. We wanted to make sure that the visual
information would be the sole priming means. In any other case, we would not have been
able to rule out the possibility that the music was responsible for any obtained
experimental effects. Third, the videos were downloaded from YouTube and no editing
was undertaken except for equating the duration of the streams (three minutes each).
Fourth (reported in the revised version of our paper), we conducted a pilot test to verify
the conceptualization of the urban context prime. Sixty-three student volunteers (other
than the participants in the main study) took part in a session in which each participant
watched two videos (those that were used in the main study). The first video (Video 1)
depicted streets full of people, heavy traffic, and the like (a big city context). The second
video (Video 2) portrayed small streets, sparse traffic, and the like (a small city context).
Next, participants were asked for their opinion about the two cities that were shown in the
videos. The questions and the percentage choosing each option are shown below.
Statistical significance is denoted by an asterisk.
1. In which city is the population larger?
Video 1 Video 2
[86]* [14] <U+03C7>2 (1) = 32.143, p < .01
2. In which city is the pace of life slower and more relaxed?
Video 1 Video 2
[3] [97]* <U+03C7>2 (1) = 55.254, p < .01
It can be seen that 86% of respondents associated Video 1 with a big-city context, which
means that they also associated Video 2 with a small-city context. Furthermore, 97% of
respondents associated Video 2 with a slow-paced urban context, which means that they
also associated Video 1 with a fast-paced urban context. Taken together, these findings
confirmed that both video clips were perceived by the participants as we meant them to
be perceived, thus strengthening the internal validity of our study. Of particular
importance, the data in the present study came from observations of behavior in a
manipulated urban context. A methodology based on experimental manipulation reduces
the possibility of alternative explanations and confounds in the study. Furthermore, as we
directly tested the hypothesized causal direction between urban context and behavior, our
methodology provides support for a causal account, namely, that the urban context was
responsible for the behavioral differences observed. By demonstrating that the urban
context affects the likelihood of one’s behaving in a promotion- or prevention-oriented
manner, the empirical findings reported here strongly support the concept that cities are
powerful regulatory systems, and as such they affect motivation and thus the way people
regulate their behavior.
<U+F0B7> From an external validity perspective, it is noteworthy that in the present work we
focused on the North American culture, and more specifically, on American cities and
American way of life. Thus, it has to be acknowledged that our findings might be limited
in generalizability and not be applicable to other cultures (e.g., Japanese cities and
Japanese way of life). This can be a direction for future research. We refer to this in our
revised paper. Furthermore, there is always the question whether data from a laboratory
experiment apply in the everyday real world. Our manipulation was based on video clips
that showed real cities and scenes from real life in a city (people walking in the streets,
shopping, sitting in a coffee shop, eating in a restaurant, drinking in a bar, and the like).
These scenes conveyed a real sense of either a vibrant city or a slow-paced city, which
was confirmed as described here above in the section on internal validity. We are
planning on a field study to further explore our ideas.
<U+F0B7> The video clips: We used a video-based experimental priming technique to make
participants momentarily experience either a big city context or a small city context. One
group was primed with a video showing large, busy streets full of people, heavy traffic,
high-rise luxury towers, arts and cultural events, street performances, fancy restaurants, a
vibrant night life scene, and in general a fast-paced, hectic urban environment. The
second group was primed with a video showing relatively small, tranquil streets, people
slowly walking while looking at display windows, some hanging out in local cafes, others
riding bicycles for recreation, and in general a slow-paced, leisurely urban setting. As
noted above, the soundtrack (background music) was muted to avoid a confounding
effect due to priming modality. We wanted to make sure that the visual information
would be the sole priming means. In any other case, we would not have been able to rule
out the possibility that the music was responsible for any obtained experimental effects.
These videos were not supposed to substitute for the urban interaction, but rather to make
participants momentarily experience a specific urban context, which they actually did
(see section on internal validity above).

<U+F0B7> Presentation of the results – results from a multiple regression analysis (and a simple
slope analysis) are presented in our paper as many other papers do. For example, see
Higgins et al. (2001), and also Faddegon et al. (2008). Not only did we present the results
of the multiple regression analysis and simple slope analysis as most researchers do, but
we also illustrated the results using a median split procedure which is an additional means
of presenting the results to the readers. We do not use regression tables to present the
results, nor does Higgins in his papers.
<U+F0B7> Regarding the error bars in the figures, we would like to clarify: the analysis we based
our conclusions upon is the multiple regression. The figures were meant to make it easier
for the reader to understand the results. These figures are based on median split procedure
and as such they do not include error bars. These are just an illustration of the results. The
analysis readers should be focusing on is the multiple regression analysis and the simple
slope analysis where all data are presented.

<U+F0B7> In our analysis of cities, we distinguish between a big city context and a small city
context. The former reflects on large, vibrant cities with a huge population and a fast pace
of life, whereas the latter on small cities with a slow pace of life. However, even large,
vibrant cities have relaxed and tranquil neighborhoods, generally in the outer circles of
the city. Thus, the urban context we talk about in the present work in the one that
represents the center of the city. It is the city center where differences in pace of life (if
exist) can be seen clearly. This point has been added to our revised paper.

hough there is a lot of research showing that people living in big cities behave differently than
se living in small cities, the question remains: why? Why is there a connection between city
and human behavior? In the study reported here, the participants’ chronic regulatory focus
first measured, after which an experimental priming technique was used to make participants
porarily experience either a big-city context or small-city context. Next, behavior was
essed by observing the participants’ performance on a signal detection task. Empirical
dence is presented that a big-city context is likely to encourage extreme and polarized
aviors, whereas a small-city context is likely to encourage more moderate and less polarized
avioral responses.

preciated very much all the work that went into the revision. My remaining question is to
ify the sequence of the measurement. Does the measurement of chronic RFQ scale come
ore or after the city prime? If it comes after the prime, please acknowledge that it is a major
itation of the paper and the prime doesn't change the RFQ score.

measurement of the chronic regulatory focus was made before the priming. To avoid any
biguity, this is emphasized in our paper: “There is evidence suggesting that people who live in
e cities behave differently than those living in smaller cities [1,30]. But the question remains,
y is this so? To address this issue, a three-step procedure has been applied. First, the
ticipants’ chronic regulatory focus was measured. Second, an experimental priming technique
used to make participants temporarily experience either a big-city context or small-city
text. Third, behavior was assessed by observing the participants’ performance on a signal
ection task. We hypothesized that the experience of a big-city context would encourage
ticipants to engage in promotion-focused behaviors, whereas the experience of a small-city
text would discourage participants from displaying promotion-focused behaviors.”
