Review: RSOS-160723
Title: Increasing cognitive load attenuates right arm swing in healthy human walking.
This manuscript describes the effects of a cognitive dual task on arm swing asymmetry in
different age groups. With increasing cognitive load, arm swing asymmetry increases, with a
reduction of right arm swing compared to left arm swing.
1. I am not convinced by the findings the authors present. They leave out 36 subjects,
because these have initial asymmetry. However, it is unclear why this would exclude these
subjects, and, as such, how valid the findings are. The discussion regarding this topic also fails to
satisfy; the fact that no ceiling effects were present actually makes me want to see the subjects
included. Also the fact that “no consistent effects were seen”, makes one doubt why these were
not included… Maybe the effects are just not as strong?
2. The statement in the introduction that this was “only to a nonsignificant degree” does not
seem correct for reference 5? Also, significant effects seem to have been found by Mirelman et al.
Thus, as far as I can see, the introduction provides a false rationale for this study by saying that
these studies may have been underpowered.
3
3. Introduction: how can dual tasking at the same time unmask things about higher control
and about CPG’s??
4. Introduction: it is not exactly clear to me what the authors want to learn from this
experiment; so what if dual tasking influences ASI (which has already been shown..) It indeed
may suggest a cortical involvement in arm swing… which has also already been shown using
more direct methods. So what was the purpose of this study? This is not exactly clear to me.
5. Moreover, the discussion seems rather long (especially compared to the rather short
introduction), and speculative.

The study reported in this manuscript investigates how cognitive load induced by a colour
Stroop task impacts on arm swing asymmetry during walking on a treadmill in adults of different
age groups.
While exploring the intricate interaction between the walking body and the brain is very
interesting, the study’s motivation did not become very clear nor did I find the results
particularly convincing. At present, the motivation seems to be based purely on the fact that
someone else has done this before but didn’t get a very clear result while this study now obtains a
significant result (at least for the oldest age group), showing that right arm movement decreases
with increasing cognitive load.
Please could the authors be far more explicit in what they wanted to investigate and why the
Stroop task was the ideal task for this? Why do the authors think that they would have a better
chance to unveil underlying neural mechanisms with their task than previous studies? This
should include some background information about how this task relates to lateralised processes
in cognition; which cortical areas it involves; how such cortical areas are thought to be crucial in
walking and why; how cognitive performance in the STROOP task changes with age and gender,
including changes in cortical network recruitments; why one would expect increase in
lateralisation for a cognitive task to increase lateralisation in arm swing but not lower limb
kinematics; and how this is related to automated walking and the central pattern generator.
4
To establish a clear link between cognitive load and arm swing, the data would also need to be
analysed more extensively: Where are the behavioural data and how do they relate to the
observed changes in arm swing? Were men generally more affected by incongruency in the
STROOP task than women within the current study (except for the oldest cohort), and could this
be the reason why women showed less asymmetry in arm swing?
Is there a direct correlation between STROOP impact and arm swing impact irrespective of a
person’s age? How do the changes in arm swing relate to changes in lower limb kinematics, i.e. is
it simply because someone got generally slower, asymmetries are more pronounced? How might
the effect be amplified by walking on a treadmill which doesn't allow to adjust walking speed
that easily?
Given that increased cognitive load is thought to affect general walking speed and step timing as
much as spatial stride-to-stride variability, please could these data be added? These data are
critical if one wants to discuss possible impact on central pattern generator (CPG) rhythms as
attempted in the discussion (pages 10 to 12). Also, might stride time have been affected by
stimulus presentation time and how would this confound the interpretation of the data?

Comments to the Author:
Three expert reviewers have evaluated your paper on the effects of a distracting cognitive task on
arm swing asymmetry. While one reviewer who had seen the paper previously at RSPB is now
satisfied with the revisions, two additional reviewers raise concerns about the strength of the
scientific contribution considering the number of subjects excluded and the unclear rationale for
the specific approach and analysis. Both of the critical reviewers raised concerns about lack of
clarity in the introduction in providing a clear motivation for the study, as well as concerns about
overly speculative interpretation in the discussion. We will consider a resubmitted version of the
if the authors extensively revise the manuscript to fully address these points, making the
rationale and novel contribution of the study clear, and providing a clear interpretation of the
results that is fully justified by the experimental data and analysis presented.

Comments to the Author:
Your manuscript has been reviewed again by two previous reviewers who suggested major
revisions. While one of these reviewers is now satisfied with the revised paper, the 2nd remains
critical of the authors' exclusion criteria for subjects with a baseline ASI outside -20 to +20.
While I can understand the reviewer's concern that this may limit the generality of the findings in
some respects, I see that the authors have clearly explained their rationale for the exclusion and
provided a detailed discussion of this within the manuscript, along with supporting
supplementary figures that include all subjects. Based on this, I suggest that the main findings are
scientifically sound as presented, and the paper is suitable for publication in RSOS.
I do request a few additional minor revisions:
1. I suggest the authors move some of the explanation of the rationale behind the exclusion
criteria to the methods section, adding additional clarification to the brief explanation on page 7
lines 39-43. This section of the methods is currently too brief and doesn’t provide a clear rationale
for the exclusion, and it may be confusing to a reader to wait until the end of the discussion for
this key information. The relevant discussion section can then focus on the post-hoc
interpretation of the supplementary data in comparison to the main findings.
2. Please clarify the labeling on the supplementary figures. Currently, the three different
groupings in SI Figure 1 are not explained. I presume it represents the included subjects in the
middle, and excluded subjects below and above with arm swing asymmetry outside the inclusion
range. However, this should be clearly labeled and stated.

3. Please ensure that the supporting data are archived in a suitable public research data
repository such as data dryad.org, which provides a unique DOI and permanent citation record,
rather than just a dropbox link. In addition to the data file, the authors should include a metadata
description of what is contained in the file (as it is rather large and complex).

Professor Kevin Padian
Royal Society Open Science
Dear Professor Padian,
Many thanks for the thorough and useful review of our manuscript, which we resubmit with significant
improvements.
Some of the criticism from reviewer 2 and perhaps reviewer 3 seems to stem from a potential
misunderstanding of the arm swing symmetry metrics used in this study and those of previous
authors. While this is specifically addressed in the discussion, it is clear that a description of absolute
and directional arm swing indices would strengthen the introduction and we have added a section
which explicitly clarifies how using a directional ASI makes this study different to those performed
previously. As this point is so crucial, we will deal with it first and then return to the reviewers’ points in
order.
Arm swing asymmetry indices.
Plate et al. and Mirelman et al. investigated arm swing symmetry under cognitive load. They used an
absolute asymmetry index for their primary outcomes, i.e.:
<U+0001D43F><U+0001D43F>-<U+0001D445><U+0001D445>
ABS <U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434> = <U+FFFD> <U+FFFD> ×100
<U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A>(<U+0001D43F><U+0001D43F>,<U+0001D445><U+0001D445>)
which gives a scale between 0 and 100 along which asymmetry with predominance in either direction
increases away from 0 (identical amplitudes on both sides). This scale is agnostic to the direction of
asymmetry. Using the absolute ASI in this way only allows the hypothesis “does x increase arm swing
asymmetry (irrespective of direction)”. The significant findings of Mirelman et al., Kuhtz-Buschbeck et
al. and Riley et al. relate only to this directionless asymmetry.
<U+0001D43F><U+0001D43F> - <U+0001D445><U+0001D445>
<U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434> = <U+FFFD> <U+FFFD> ×100
<U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A><U+0001D45A>(<U+0001D43F><U+0001D43F>, <U+0001D445><U+0001D445>)
Plate et al also describe directional ASI as a secondary outcome, i.e. where 0 also indicates identical
amplitudes on both sides, but the scale runs from -100 (maximal right-dominant asymmetry) to 100
(maximal left-dominant asymmetry). While their primary focus was also on absolute ASI, they state
that an ANOVA assessing directional ASI between a Stroop task and a counting task at preferred
speed confirmed as significant an increase (i.e. increase in left dominance) between the two
conditions, although it is not clear which conditions were included in this ANOVA and they do not
explicitly state the results of post-hoc t-tests. We have clarified this in the introduction as follows:
“The large majority of studies investigating arm swing symmetry examine the effect of walking
conditions or disease states on an absolute arm swing symmetry index (ASI) calculated from a range
of base parameters including sagittal shoulder angles or wrist trajectories, with most indices a
variation on this calculation, in which L is the parameter of interest (e.g. sagittal shoulder angle) on
the left and R that on the right:

which gives a scale of 0 (symmetrical) to 100 (maximally asymmetrical). Importantly, such metrics are
agnostic to the direction of asymmetry and, as such, preclude the study of lateralised effects. When
lateralised effects are sought, the absolute term is dropped, giving a scale of -100 (maximal right-
dominant asymmetry) to 100 (maximum left-dominant asymmetry), with 0 representing perfect
symmetry:

<U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434><U+0001D434> = <U+FFFD> <U+FFFD> ×100

Intriguingly, studies of healthy walkers consistently describe a tendency for arm swing movements to
be larger on the left [8,10–12]. Plate et al recently investigated the effect of a serial subtraction task
and a Stroop colour/word naming task during treadmill walking. While their main interest was absolute
asymmetry changes, they noted that the Stroop task was associated with significantly more left-
lateralised arm swing in healthy older walkers than the subtraction task.[8]”
When the distinction between absolute and directional is understood, the rationale for the present
study becomes clear: previous authors consistently describe increases in absolute asymmetry under
cognitive load that are higher in elderly and patient groups. We wanted to build on these suggestive
results and firmly establish whether increasing Stroop task difficulty indeed results in a shift in
directional asymmetry to the left, confirming a surprising laterality effect in an everyday human
behaviour. Furthermore, we aimed to clearly establish if cognitive load was directly implicated in the
observed effect by applying a two “dose” paradigm of low and high difficulty in different age groups
known to be differentially susceptible to the Stroop task.
Reviewer 1
We thank Reviewer 1 for his extremely constructive comments and suggestions during the two rounds
of review. I personally have never experienced such thorough and helpful contributions from a
referee. The manuscript benefited enormously from his input.
Reviewer 2
1. I am not convinced by the findings the authors present. They leave out 36 subjects, because
these have initial asymmetry. However, it is unclear why this would exclude these subjects,
and, as such, how valid the findings are. The discussion regarding this topic also fails to
satisfy; the fact that no ceiling effects were present actually makes me want to see the
subjects included. Also the fact that “no consistent effects were seen”, makes one doubt why
these were not included… Maybe the effects are just not as strong?
Response: We defined a priori exclusion criteria for this study, including the prerequisite that subjects
displaying large degrees of arm swing asymmetry in either direction would not be entered into the
analysis. Piloting of this paradigm convinced us that baseline asymmetry was quite common and that
a cutoff would likely be necessary to test our hypothesis. We hesitated to take a cutoff ASI value from
the literature based on a fundamentally different parameter (sagittal angles vs our 3D trajectories) and
Lewek et al, while using the same measure of arm swing, used an absolute asymmetry angle. In their
study, they proposed a cutoff for “non-pathological” arm swing asymmetry (absolute ASI) of 2.4 times
their mean ASI which we calculate to be 9.46 for normal walking (their Table 2). As we can anticipate
that the majority of the absolute asymmetry was coming from left-dominant swing, this also gives a
value around 20. Ultimately we used our own data (doi:10.1089/neu.2016.4554, Figure 2) in which we
observed a ceiling effect in a group of three of 12 healthy controls who began with arm swing over 20
ASI. As agreed during the first round of review, we transparently present these excluded data as
supplementary figures to allow readers to draw their own conclusions.
In response to the reviewer’s comments we analysed the variance and response of the three groups
(the main cohort and the two excluded groups) – this revealed that a ceiling effect probably was
present, although multiple factors are probably at play here. We have updated the relevant part of the
discussion to reflect this.
“ASI is highly variable between individuals and this motivated our decision to exclude a priori from our
analysis those with marked baseline asymmetry, with the rationale that any dual-task response may
be masked by a ceiling effect if individuals exhibiting highly asymmetrical arm swing during NW were
included. However, determining an appropriate cut-off value for exclusion is difficult for a number of
reasons, especially as a degree of left-dominant asymmetry appears to be physiological during
normal treadmill walking.[8,10,35,45] The approaches taken by different research groups to calculate
ASI are diverse, with various two-dimensional sagittal metrics most commonly used in conjunction
with two competing calculations; the ASI and asymmetry angle[68,69]. Furthermore, an absolute, non-
directional ASI is used by many authors whose hypotheses do not investigate laterality. Unfortunately,
the only study using comparable, three-dimensional trajectories to describe asymmetry[9] is of limited
usefulness in informing cut-off values in our cohort as it featured overground walking and used an
absolute asymmetry angle. We therefore referred to data from a previous study in our laboratory[10],
in which three of 12 healthy control subjects who exhibited normal walking ASI values of +20 or more
showed evidence of a ceiling effect under cognitive loading, to set inclusion baseline ASI values of -
20 to +20.
This approach proved justified as no consistent dual-task effect was observed amongst the 28
subjects excluded for baseline ASI values over 20 (Supplementary Figure 1). Individual responses
were highly variable (Supplementary Figure 2). Only 36% of individuals in this group showed an ASI
shift between NW and Stroophard of > 10, compared to 46% of those in the included group
(Supplementary Figure 2). This fact, and the observation that variance was 13% smaller in the group
with ASI over 20 compared to the included group, suggest that a ceiling effect indeed contributed to
the findings observed in this group. The eight individuals with strongly right-dominant asymmetry
during NW (< -20) showed no common response to cognitive load (Supplementary Figures 1 & 2).
Some healthy individuals may exhibit marked baseline asymmetry due to acquired atypical gait
patterns[70] and the possibility exists that some baseline asymmetry may have been a subclinical
manifestation of neurological or musculoskeletal disease in our participants. Both causes of
asymmetry may result in different responses to cognitive load.”
2. The statement in the introduction that this was “only to a nonsignificant degree” does not
seem correct for reference 5? Also, significant effects seem to have been found by Mirelman et
al. Thus, as far as I can see, the introduction provides a false rationale for this study by saying
that these studies may have been underpowered.
Response: Please see the above points regarding asymmetry indices. We concede that we may have
misrepresented the findings of Plate et al. and have updated the manuscript to correct this. As
discussed earlier, Mirelman et al and other authors used a non-directional ASI.
3. Introduction: how can dual tasking at the same time unmask things about higher control
and about CPG’s??
Response: We assume that arm swing is the product of both supraspinal and CPG influences. If the
Stroop task reliably modulates the degree of supraspinal control being exerted on the cervical CPGs,
then comparison of, for instance, reflex or TMS experiments on the left and right side with and without
the Stroop task may provide information on the relative contributions of the brain and the spinal cord
in locomotor movements. We have updated the introduction as follows:
“If performing the Stroop task while walking is indeed associated with differential responses in the left
and right arms, deliberate modulation of arm swing asymmetry in this way may provide information on
the role of both higher centres and spinal networks in the control of locomotor arm movements.
Attributes of the hitherto elusive human CPG may be studied by, for instance, assessing the phase
dependent characteristics of spinal reflexes[23] with and without the Stroop task or assessing the
magnitude of the Stroop effect on arm swing in patients with spinal or brain lesions.[9,10,25]”
4. Introduction: it is not exactly clear to me what the authors want to learn from this
experiment; so what if dual tasking influences ASI (which has already been shown..) It indeed
may suggest a cortical involvement in arm swing… which has also already been shown using
more direct methods. So what was the purpose of this study? This is not exactly clear to me.
Response: In addition to wholly reformulating the introduction, we have summarised this as follows:
We aimed to build on the suggestive findings of Plate et al. by confirming the presence of a lateralised
effect of the Stroop task on arm swing in a large cohort of healthy individuals and establishing
whether left or right swing amplitudes are affected. We utilise a modified version of the traditional
Stroop task[26] using a pseudorandomised presentation frequency, designed to eliminate any
entrainment of rhythmic gait parameters and encourage constant attention.
5. Moreover, the discussion seems rather long (especially compared to the rather short
introduction), and speculative.
Reponse: We have removed some of the more speculative elements of the discussion and
lengthened the introduction (see above) to clarify the purpose of this experiment.
Reviewer 3
Comments to the Author(s)
The study reported in this manuscript investigates how cognitive load induced by a colour
Stroop task impacts on arm swing asymmetry during walking on a treadmill in adults of
different age groups.
While exploring the intricate interaction between the walking body and the brain is very
interesting, the study’s motivation did not become very clear nor did I find the results
particularly convincing. At present, the motivation seems to be based purely on the fact that
someone else has done this before but didn’t get a very clear result while this study now
obtains a significant result (at least for the oldest age group), showing that right arm
movement decreases with increasing cognitive load.
1. Please could the authors be far more explicit in what they wanted to investigate and
why the Stroop task was the ideal task for this?
Response: Please see response to Review 2, point 4. The Stoop task is extremely well established,
easy to implement and most authors concur that it utilises left-lateralised brain structures.
2. Why do the authors think that they would have a better chance to unveil underlying
neural mechanisms with their task than previous studies?
The only previous study to examine this effect did so in passing (Plate et al. 2015). In their
experiment, the Stoop task was associated with significantly more left-dominant arm swing than a
serial subtraction task. We were concerned that the regularity of the presentation of the Stroop stimuli
may lead to entrainment of leg / and or arm rhythmicity and thus developed a paradigm to minimise
this. Furthermore, the unpredictability of simuli means that the brain is constantly anticipating the next
stimulus and that cognitive-motor interference is consistent rather than pulsatile. We clarify this in the
introduction;
“We utilise a modified version of the traditional Stroop task[26] using a pseudorandomised
presentation frequency, designed to eliminate any entrainment of rhythmic gait parameters and
encourage constant attention.”
and methods:
“To avoid potential entrainment of temporal gait parameters and to encourage constant attention,
stimulus duration was adjusted so that no more than two sequential stimuli had a duration within
200ms of that of the previous stimulus, although mean stimulus frequency was maintained at 1Hz
over the trial.”
3. This should include some background information about how this task relates to
lateralised processes in cognition; which cortical areas it involves; how such cortical
areas are thought to be crucial in walking and why; how cognitive performance in the
STROOP task changes with age and gender, including changes in cortical network
recruitments; why one would expect increase in lateralisation for a cognitive task to
increase lateralisation in arm swing but not lower limb kinematics; and how this is
related to automated walking and the central pattern generator.
We have added the following section to the introduction:
“The Stroop task, in which a participant must state the colour in which a colour-word is presented
while suppressing its conflicting, written form, depends upon a number of brain structures critical for
cognitive control, including prefrontal, cingulate and basal ganglia networks, [11–14] some of which
are also common to the control of gait [15–18] and arm swing.[9,19]
As the Stroop task is predominantly a language exercise, its neural substrates are understood to be
substantially lateralised, with left hemisphere structures activated more strongly than those on the
right.[11,20] Cognitive-motor interference primarily in the left brain may therefore be responsible for
the observed lateralised effect of the Stroop task on arm swing. While cognitive dual tasks, including
the Stroop task, have been shown to have bilateral effects on lower limb kinematics[21], similar,
unilateral effects either do not arise in the legs or are compensated for due to the need for maintaining
symmetry for forward progression. The lumbar central pattern generator (CPG) may also be less
susceptible to modulation of supraspinal influence than its cervical subsidiary involved in rhythmic arm
movements.[4,22,23] In contrast to lower limb locomotor movements, arm swing may marginally
increase the efficiency of gait but is not necessary for walking[2,24] and thus it is reasonable to
assume that a lateralised response to interference from unilateral cognitive loading is more likely to
manifest here. Confirmation of such measurably lateralised cognitive-motor interference in such a
ubiquitous activity would be surprising and a potentially useful tool for the study of human motor
control in health and disease.”
4. To establish a clear link between cognitive load and arm swing, the data would also
need to be analysed more extensively: Where are the behavioural data and how do
they relate to the observed changes in arm swing? Were men generally more affected
by incongruency in the STROOP task than women within the current study (except for
the oldest cohort), and could this be the reason why women showed less asymmetry in
arm swing?
Response: We have added performance data for the Stroop task. The data is supportive of the ASI
results. A new figure has been added (Fig 2). The following has been added to the results:
Performance in both the congruent and incongruent Stroop tasks became worse with age (Figure 2a,
b). Errors were rare in the congruent task, with no 20-39 year olds making more than five mistakes.
Males made more mistakes than their female counterparts in the congruent task. In the two younger
age groups, men were more likely to make more than five errors during the incongruent task than
women, but women’s performance deteriorated significantly over 60 years of age during this task, in
which 89.3% of older females and 80% of older males made more than 5 errors.
5. Is there a direct correlation between Stroop impact and arm swing impact irrespective
of a person’s age?
The following has been added to the results section and a new figure added (Fig 2b):
“Overall, ASI did not correlate with Stroop performance (rho .114, p=0.071) but there was a significant
correlation in males (rho .198, p=0.042; Figure 2c).”
6. How do the changes in arm swing relate to changes in lower limb kinematics, i.e. is it
simply because someone got generally slower, asymmetries are more pronounced?
How might the effect be amplified by walking on a treadmill which doesn't allow to
adjust walking speed that easily?
In this experiment, treadmill speed was fixed (see Methods). Some dual-task experiments have
suggested that step length decreases under fixed-speed dual-task methodologies but this effect was
small and inconsistent in Al-Yahya’s meta-analysis. We did not observe this (Supplementary Table 1)
in our cohort. While an increase in markers of gait instability (variability and absolute asymmetry
indices) may be expected with slower speed (or a decrease in step length), we see no reason why
changes in lower limb kinematics should systematically cause directional asymmetry. This is
especially true as walking speed was constrained in this experiment and therefore no reduced-speed
asymmetry could be evoked.
7. Given that increased cognitive load is thought to affect general walking speed and step
timing as much as spatial stride-to-stride variability, please could these data be
added? These data are critical if one wants to discuss possible impact on central
pattern generator (CPG) rhythms as attempted in the discussion (pages 10 to 12).
These data are available in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 3 and mentioned in
the first paragraph of the discussion. Also, again, walking speed was fixed, therefore any potential
speed-related effects were suppressed.
8. Also, might stride time have been affected by stimulus presentation time and how
would this confound the interpretation of the data?
Please see the response to point 2. We went to great lengths to design a version of the Stroop task
that does not permit stimulus entrainment. The fact that stride time and stride time variability were
unaffected by the walking condition suggests that this was successful. To indicate this we have added
a sentence to the results section:
“Stride time and stride time variability was unaffected by condition or age group.”
Once again, the authors thank the reviewers for their time and expertise in reviewing this manuscript.
We hope we have satisfied the remaining concerns of reviewers 2 and 3 and that the manuscript is
now acceptable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

Dear Professor Padian,
Please find below our final revisions. We hope you find them adequate to proceed with publication of
our manuscript.
Editorial revisions:
I do request a few additional minor revisions:
1. I suggest the authors move some of the explanation of the rationale
behind the exclusion criteria to the methods section, adding
additional clarification to the brief explanation on page 7 lines 39-
43. This section of the methods is currently too brief and doesn’t
provide a clear rationale for the exclusion, and it may be confusing
to a reader to wait until the end of the discussion for this key
information. The relevant discussion section can then focus on the
post-hoc interpretation of the supplementary data in comparison to
the main findings.
We have edited the two sections to incorporate this suggestion, which indeed improves the flow of the
manuscript.
The relevant section in the methods now reads:
ASI during normal treadmill walking varies considerably between individuals and this motivated our decision to
exclude a priori from our analysis those with marked baseline asymmetry, with the rationale that any dual-task
response may be masked by a ceiling effect if individuals exhibiting highly asymmetrical arm swing during NW
were included. Based on observations in a pilot cohort,[10] we therefore excluded subjects exhibiting
significant asymmetry to either the left or the right during NW, defined as an ASI of <-20 or >20.
While that in the discussion now reads:
Excluded subjects
Determining an appropriate cut-off value for exclusion in experiments measuring ASI is difficult for a number
of reasons, especially as a degree of left-dominant asymmetry appears to be physiological during normal
treadmill walking.[8,10,35,45] The approaches taken by different research groups to calculate ASI are diverse,
with various two-dimensional sagittal metrics most commonly used in conjunction with two competing
calculations; the ASI and asymmetry angle[66,67]. Furthermore, an absolute, non-directional ASI is used by
many authors whose hypotheses do not investigate laterality. Unfortunately, the only study using comparable,
three-dimensional trajectories to describe asymmetry[9] is of limited usefulness in informing cut-off values in
our cohort as it featured overground walking and used an absolute asymmetry angle. We therefore referred to
data from a previous study in our laboratory[10], in which three of 12 healthy control subjects who exhibited
normal walking ASI values of +20 or more showed evidence of a ceiling effect under cognitive loading, to set
inclusion baseline ASI values of -20 to +20.
2. Please clarify the labeling on the supplementary figures. Currently,
the three different groupings in SI Figure 1 are not explained. I
presume it represents the included subjects in the middle, and
excluded subjects below and above with arm swing asymmetry outside
the inclusion range. However, this should be clearly labeled and
stated.
The legends for these figures now read as follows:
Supplementary Figure 1. Effect of cognitive load on ASI for the entire cohort (n = 119), separated into three
groups based on inclusion status. Only individuals exhibiting an ASI between -20 and 20 were included in the
final analysis. Low baseline ASI; excluded group exhibiting a right-dominant ASI during normal walking of < -20
(n=8). High baseline ASI; excluded group exhibiting a left-dominant ASI during normal walking of > 20 (n=28).
ASI is given as the mean value per gait cycle over a trial of 45 seconds (approximately 42 gait cycles at 4kmh-1).
Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. ASI; arm swing symmetry index.
Supplementary Figure 2. Changes in ASI in individuals under increasing cognitive load for the entire cohort
(n=119), including excluded groups. ASI is given as the mean value per gait cycle over a trial of 45 seconds
(approximately 42 gait cycles at 4kmh-1). Individuals’ ASI values in the three different trials are linked with a
dotted line. Individuals with an ASI less than -20 or more than 20 during normal walking were excluded from
the final analysis. The ASI of these individuals during the incongruent Stroop task are indicated by a + (ASI
during normal walking > 20) or a – (ASI during normal walking < -20).
And Supplementary Figure 1 itself has been edited to include labels for the three groups based on
inclusion status.
3. Please ensure that the supporting data are archived in a
suitable public research data repository such as data dryad.org,
which provides a unique DOI and permanent citation record, rather
than just a dropbox link. In addition to the data file, the authors
should include a metadata description of what is contained in the
file (as it is rather large and complex).
We have created a datadryad deposit at http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2kd0b including the
presentations used in the study, the final data and a readme file explaining data headings etc.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this revision, the authors have answered all my questions
satisfactorily, and I'd like to congratulate them to their nice work.
Before publication, they might wish to modify the final manuscript in a few
places to shorten excessively long sentences. Also, please see:
p39 line 7: I'd change ""it is unclear whether...." into "It remains,
however, unclear whether ..."
p39 line 47: "on the role of both higher centres..." - add "cortical" for
non-neuropsychology readers
p43 line 30: change "Methods" for "Background" as formula has moved
We have incorporated all of these sensible suggestions into the manuscript.
We trust that these improvements to the manuscript mean it is now suitable for publication in RSOS.
We thank the editor, editorial staff and reviewers for a very rewarding and professional peer-review
process.
Yours sincerely,
