This is an exciting and well executed study investigating the concept of the extended self in
adolescent chimpanzees. I’ve reviewed a previous version of the study and am delighted to see
that many of my previous comments have been helpful in revising this paper to a high standard.
One of its strengths is the design of the eight conditions, ruling out just seeing stickers, or just
seeing a familiar face as explanations for the high performance by the chimpanzees in the delay
conditions. The analyses now make explicit comparisons across conditions, and there is
discussion about what this means. There are data presented from the mirror and live pretests,
indicating that the 3 successful chimpanzees were 100% successful in these pretests.
The methods are well specified, and reliability for mutually exclusive behavioural codes was
found to be excellent.
I really liked the discussion about contingency testing, and think that the point could be put into
stronger phylogenetic perspective with the inclusion of some reports on contingency detection
but not contingency testing in capuchin monkeys (by Paukner), and contingency testing as a
possible learning mechanism underlying successful performance in MSR by apes and human
children (e.g., Bard et al., 2006 for the former and Kartner & Keller, Monographs of the SRCD for
the latter).
I would like the authors to include some discussion about issues involving marking with human
children, and to have a more confident presentation about not using surreptitious marking or
anaesthesia in their subjects (lines 342-366). Part of this discussion should also rely on how many
stickers remained after 2 minutes without any visual feedback (I didn’t see these data). In
contrast to the impression of these paragraphs, the authors did have a MSR type test with the
mirror pretest, and with the live video test (a point which they could highlight more in this
discussion).

This is the first report of delayed MSR in chimpanzees. Though the sample is relatively small, the
results are nonetheless convincing and worth publishing with only minor revision. I have just a
few comments.
(1) My only comment is on the statistics. It was not obvious to me why the authors chose to
perform analyses on the individual chimpanzee performance across the different test conditions
instead of performing a non-parametric repeated measures test (like Friedman). I think this
would be useful and place the results within statistical framework that is far more familiar to
scientists than the rather obtuse statistical tests performed. Indeed, a graph with the simple the
mean proportion of responses (+/- s.e.) across all conditions for the entire sample would be nice
to include. Don’t get me wrong, I like the presentation of individual data but this some more
group summary statistics and analyses would strengthen the manuscript.
(2) I respectfully disagree with the authors comments in the Discussion beginning on line
342. So what of the chimpanzees know they have been marked? Why is this a problem or
limitation? I would suggest that the simple fact they know they have been marked and still use
the mirror or video images to guide their behavior, is an even more powerful demonstration that
they understand the property of mirror and how to use it to again information about self. I would
also be willing to bet that this same supposed limitation could be equally applied to monkeys and
they would still fail the test.
(3) Lastly, two individuals failed, at least according to the criteria used by the authors and
their discussion of why they failed was a little weak. Can the authors offer some more concrete
ideas and possible explanations for these results?

Point-by-Point Responses to the Reviewers
We are grateful to the reviewers for their constructive comments. As indicated in the
responses that follow, we have taken the reviewers’ comments and suggestions into
account in the revised version of the manuscript.
We have also confirmed that all of the ending statements (i.e., ethics, data accessibility,
competing interests, authors’ contributions, acknowledgements, and funding statements)
follow the guidelines of the journal.
We have revised our manuscript as follows.
Reviewer 1
Comment
I really liked the discussion about contingency testing, and think that the point could be
put into stronger phylogenetic perspective with the inclusion of some reports on
contingency detection but not contingency testing in capuchin monkeys (by Paukner),
and contingency testing as a possible learning mechanism underlying successful
performance in MSR by apes and human children (e.g., Bard et al., 2006 for the former
and Kartner & Keller, Monographs of the SRCD for the latter).
Response
We have inserted additional discussion about contingency testing, citing Paukner’s
studies, Bard et al., 2006, and Kartner et al., 2012, as follows:
“Previous studies have shown that contingency checking behavior is a possible learning
mechanism underlying successful performance in mirror self-recognition by apes [13]
and human children [25]. In addition, capuchin monkeys were able to detect
contingency but did not engage in active contingency checking behavior nor showed
evidence of mirror self-recognition [26, 27]. Therefore, the emergence of contingency
checking behavior can be considered as an important sign of self-recognition in mirror
or video images from both ontogenetic and phylogenetic perspectives.” (Lines 319–326)
Comment
I would like the authors to include some discussion about issues involving marking with
human children, and to have a more confident presentation about not using surreptitious
marking or anaesthesia in their subjects (lines 342-366). Part of this discussion should
also rely on how many stickers remained after 2 minutes without any visual feedback (I
didn’t see these data). In contrast to the impression of these paragraphs, the authors
did have a MSR type test with the mirror pretest, and with the live video test (a point
which they could highlight more in this discussion).
Response
We have included additional discussion about issues involved with marking in human
children, and we have also inserted some additional statements to present a more clear
presentation of the overt marking procedure. In addition, we have added a sentence in
the Discussion to illustrate the fact that we carried out an MSR type test and test with
live video. Finally, the data for the number of stickers that remained after 2 minutes
without any visual feedback are available in Dryad open repository as stated in the
“Data, code and materials” section of the paper.
We have added the following text:
“With that said, some evidence suggests that surreptitious marking or anesthesia is not a
necessary condition for testing self-recognition. Fully informing the subjects about the
placement of a mark did not enhance performance in a mirror self-recognition task in
human infants [13]. Monkeys who were trained to touch a mark in an operant
conditioning paradigm still failed to pass the mark test for mirror self-recognition [31]
Our data were consistent with these findings. That is, the three chimpanzees who
showed positive evidence in the delayed condition also showed positive evidence (i.e.,
removal of stickers) in all of the mirror and live video conditions that were conducted as
pre-tests. As suggested by Bard et al. [13], we consider that overt marking, without the
need for anesthesia and isolation at testing, is a useful method for future comparative
and developmental studies.” (Lines 387–398)
Reviewer 2
Comment
My only comment is on the statistics. It was not obvious to me why the authors chose
to perform analyses on the individual chimpanzee performance across the different test
conditions instead of performing a non-parametric repeated measures test (like
Friedman). I think this would be useful and place the results within statistical
framework that is far more familiar to scientists than the rather obtuse statistical tests
performed. Indeed, a graph with the simple the mean proportion of responses (+/- s.e.)
across all conditions for the entire sample would be nice to include. Don’t get me wrong,
I like the presentation of individual data but this some more group summary statistics
and analyses would strengthen the manuscript.
Response
According to the reviewer’s comment, we have conducted a Friedman test and added
some sentences to the Results section to describe the group summary statistics, as
follows:
“The proportion of stickers removed across the eight conditions among the five subject
chimpanzees was not significantly different on the group level (Friedman test, p = 0.36).
However, there were statistically significant differences in the proportion of stickers
removed while watching the monitor across the eight conditions (Friedman test, p =
0.008) and the proportion of time spent engaging in self-directed behavior while
watching the monitor across the eight conditions (Friedman test, p = 0.018) on the
group level (Fig. 2). Because there were large individual differences in the chimpanzees’
responses, below we describe the results further on an individual level.” (Lines 246–
253)
Comment
I respectfully disagree with the authors comments in the Discussion beginning on line
342. So what of the chimpanzees know they have been marked? Why is this a problem or
limitation? I would suggest that the simple fact they know they have been marked and
still use the mirror or video images to guide their behavior, is an even more powerful
demonstration that they understand the property of mirror and how to use it to again
information about self. I would also be willing to bet that this same supposed limitation
could be equally applied to monkeys and they would still fail the test.
Response
Reviewer 1 provided a similar comment. We have added to the discussion accordingly.
Please see our response to Reviewer 1’s second comment.
Comment
Lastly, two individuals failed, at least according to the criteria used by the authors and
their discussion of why they failed was a little weak. Can the authors offer some more
concrete ideas and possible explanations for these results?
Response
We have provided additional discussion about the two chimpanzees who failed to pass
our test, according to the reviewer’s comment, as follows:
“However, the two chimpanzees easily removed the visible stickers that were placed on
their arms and legs. Therefore, the fact that these two individuals did not remove the
stickers that were placed on non-visible parts of their face cannot be ascribed to simple
lack of motivation to remove the stickers. There may be individual variations in the
depth of the level of self-recognition in chimpanzees. Alternatively, subtle differences in
the rearing environment may have led to the varied performance in this task.” (Lines
340–346)
