GENERAL COMMENTS
This is an interesting study, which adds to our current understanding of the mechanical structure
of Achilles tendon moment arms (ATMAs) among normative adult populations. The aim of this
study was to determine if the 2D length of the ATMA in the dorsi/plantar flexion degree of
freedom of the ankle joint (i.e., talocrural articulation) was dependent on whether the ankle joint
is placed into an inversion and/or eversion posture.
I feel it the authors are more consistent with their terminology, more appropriately address their
limitations and are more thoughtful with their conclusions, this nice research can and should be
considered for publication.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an inverted or everted foot position on the
Achilles tendon (AT) moment arm during ankle joint plantarflexion. The authors explain that the
main rationale is that the AT moment arm during plantarflexion is well established, but the effect
of inversion and eversion on the AT moment arm has not been studied extensively.
The paper is well-written and technically sound using standard and current techniques to
measure moment arms. However, the effect of inversion/eversion on the ankle joint axis is well
known and as the authors explain, although previous studies have shown that foot
inversion/eversion has an effect on the axis of the ankle joint (Leardini et al. 1999; Lundberg et al.
1989), the angle between the ankle joint axis and the frontal plane remained nearly constant. This
would mean that “the distance between the ankle joint axis and the AT can be assumed to be the
same regardless of the inversion or eversion position of the foot.” (page 5 lines 4-6), in other
words, the AT moment arm is not affected. For this reason, it was not very surprising that the
results show that “plantarflexion AT moment arm is similar regardless of the inversion/eversion
position of the foot indicating that the location of ankle joint axis with respect to the AT is not
dependent on calcaneal inversion and eversion” as this would be expected.
I suppose that the work does provide some explicit evidence that the AT moment arm is indeed
4
not affected as expected, by directly measuring it during inverted/everted foot positions. This
was not done specifically before so the work does provide confirmation although the results are
predictable and expected based on previous work.
Other general issues:
‘Plantarflexion AT moment arm’: I don’t understand why the AT moment arm is defined as
‘Plantarflexion AT moment arm’ throughout the manuscript. The moment arm is a mechanical
quantity defined in relation to an axis of joint rotation or a centre of rotation in 3D or 2D. I would
simply use the term ‘AT moment arm during ankle joint plantarflexion’ or simply ‘AT moment
arm’
Why is the label in Figure 2 entitled ‘Frontal plane Achilles tendon moment arm’? Is the moment
arm in relation to the frontal plane?

Your paper reporting measures of the human plantar flexion Achilles tendon moment arm has
been evaluated by two experts. The reviewers suggest that the paper is technically sound and
makes a valuable contribution to the literature. They do suggest some revisions to the text to
clarify the terminology and make the limitations of the study clear. It should be possible to
address these concerns with relatively minor revisions to the text. I’m happy to recommend the

Appendix A
Point-by-point response to reviewers
Reviewer: 1
1. Ankle joint, also known as talocrural joint.
“Ankle joint” was changed to “talocrural joint” throughout the document.
2. Rotation axis of the tibia and talus bodies (i.e. talocrural articulation)
Rewritten to “rotational axis of the articulation between the bodies of the tibia and
the talus”.
3. For the estimation of musculo-tendon forces.
Rewritten as suggested.
4. Size of an ATMA is dependent on the 3D orientation of the talocural flexion/extension
axis and Achilles tendon. Muscle activation and joint postures will influence the two
aforementioned variables.
Sentence was rewritten to include this information.
5. Please explain mechanically why the TE and CoR methods would estimate different
ATMA lengths. Leading into your discussion, how would both methods compare to 3D in
vivo estimates.
A paragraph was added explaining the assumptions of the TE and COR method. A
comparison of the COR method to 3D approaches was included in the discussion.
6. What is said with the ankle joint axis does not make sense. I think what you mean is the
translation of the talus body away from the tibia.
Sentence was rewritten to include information about AT curvature and talocrural
joint axis translation.
7. The ATMA, with the plantarflexion muscle group can generate a plantar flexion, however
the MA is about the flexion/extension axis of the talus or if you like the dorsi/plantar
flexor degree of freedom of the ankle. Please change terminology through the
document.
“Plantarflexion AT moment arm” was changed to “AT moment arm” throughout
the document.
8. Was an a priori power analysis conducted for your choice of 11 adult participants?
An a priori power analysis was not performed for this study. A post hoc analysis
is not very meaningful but would indicate that the study was underpowered with a
statistical power of 0.08 and an estimated effect size of 0.11. However, a sample
size of 270 participants would be required to achieve a statistical power of 0.8 for
the given effect size.
9. Later in the discussion and more importantly to your conclusions, you need to limit your
conclusions to a) adult populations and b) populations without body food deformities
and/or c) lower musculoskeletal pathologies (i.e. cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s,
osteoarthritis, etc.).
Corresponding additions were made in the introduction, discussion and
conclusion sections.
10. You need to be clearer in your methods that CoR is a 2D estimation method and why it
is 2D estimation method.
An additional statement was added in the sub-section “Determination of Achilles
tendon moment arm”.
11. Flat foot position? Do you mean neutral? Please be consistent with your terminology
through the paper.
Rewritten to “neutral foot position”.
12. Please report the mean (stdevs) for the inversion and eversion methods in text.
Information was included in the text as suggested.
13. You will need to make a comment on how your results may or may not have changed if
a 3D ATMA method was used.
The 2D nature of the COR method was emphasised again in the first paragraph of
the discussion and a statement regarding 2D vs 3D results was added to the last
paragraph of the discussion.
14. You did not measure the anatomical orientation of the calcaneus or talus, thus cannot
make these statements. This is a question for future research.
Sentence was rewritten and a statement regarding future research on the location
of the talocrural axis with respect to the subtalar joint axis added.
15. Limitations section: What would your results look like if a paediatric and/or pathological
population was tested? As the morphology of the talus body would not look like an
adult’s talus, one would assume the flexion/extension axes and ATMA in 3D would
indeed be affected? Speculation, but certainly worth recommending for future research.
This is indeed an interesting aspect to consider. We have added a statement at
the end of the conclusions but feel that a wider discussion of this issue is beyond
the scope of the manuscript, especially in view of the core disciplines of Royal
Society Open Science.
16. Conclusion(s): be clear this was ATMA estimated with CoR or a 2D CoR method. You
also need to be clear that these results are only valid for adult, non-pathological
populations.
Corresponding additions were made in the conclusions section.
17. It appears that as per what the statistical analysis identified mean ATMA lengths did not
differ between neutral, eversion and inversion calcaneal postures. There does seem to
be a few participants that differed by up to 1 cm between neutral eversion, neutral
inversion, which would be practically meaningful. For the participants designated with a
plus sign, a small square and a triangle, why did they display ATMA changes (~1 cm)
between joint postures that appear to be different to mean changes of the group?
We included a comment on this aspect of the results and provide an explanation
in the third paragraph of the discussion section.

1. ‘Plantarflexion AT moment arm’: I don’t understand why the AT moment arm is defined
as ‘Plantarflexion AT moment arm’ throughout the manuscript. The moment arm is a
mechanical quantity defined in relation to an axis of joint rotation or a centre of rotation
in 3D or 2D. I would simply use the term ‘AT moment arm during ankle joint
plantarflexion’ or simply ‘AT moment arm’.
“Plantarflexion AT moment arm” was changed to “AT moment arm” throughout
the document. This description was originally chosen to avoid confusion because
the triceps surae does not only contribute to plantarflexion but also to inversion
and eversion of the foot.
2. Why is the label in Figure 2 entitled ‘Frontal plane Achilles tendon moment arm’? Is the
moment arm in relation to the frontal plane?
Corrected to “Achilles tendon moment arm”.
