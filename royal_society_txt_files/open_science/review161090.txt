I consider this paper very important because it focus on an endangered large carnivore that may
experience threats in their populations, even in areas that are still considered as potentially
favourable to the presence of high density populations. Moreover, as correctly highlighted by the
authors, it is crucial to assess large carnivore population trends, demography and threats outside
of protected areas, such as the case of leopards in South African private land.
The study is relatively simple but well-done, and its main interest is in the fact that the authors
have been able to highlight the problems that large carnivores may experience outside protected
areas.

Strengths:
Statistically appropriate use of capture-recapture models with camera trap data to describe a
decline in leopard density. The paper is well written.
Weaknesses:
This study did not conduct 24 camera trap surveys as the abstract states, it conducted one survey
with 24 trap stations,
3
The area studied was quite small ( 59 to 73 km2) and was not held constant across years of study:
these issues limit the inference that can validly be drawn from highly localized changes in
density.
With only 8 individuals under study and only 4 known mortalities, inferences about the relative
importance of different causes of death are not credible.
The discussion therefore goes far beyond the limited scope of inference that would be supported
by these data. I would suggest that the data on density are better suited to a brief note in a more
specialist journal, with more cautious inferences, and no inferences about cause-specific mortality
from a sample of 4 deaths.

This is a very well written manuscript that presents valuable data on the demographics of a
leopard population in northern South Africa. I only some suggestions for minor editorial
revisions, outlined below.
Abstract, second sentence: Replace “on” with “in” “...uncertainty in population trends...”
Section 2.1 Although I find it correct to use the past tense in the first sentence, since it refers to the
study, I would argue that the rest of this section should be written in the present tense, i.e.
“...elevation varies from...”, “Climate is characterized...” and so on
Page 4, first paragraph. Although it later becomes obvious that there is really only one survey, i.e.
the cameras ran for the duration of the study period, this is not obvious here. I would recommend
to combine the sentences on rows 12-14: “The cameras ran continuously between 01/01/2012 and
02/01/2016, with the minimal delay between captures (approximately one second) (Table A2).”
4
Perhaps also consider to alter the data format to avoid confusing of days and months (e.g. “1
January 2012)”
Page 5, first paragraph. Although the ethical permit for the study is mentioned at the end of the
manuscript, perhaps mention it briefly here as well, at least state that the captures were done
following appropriate ethical and administrative permits.
References. A not exhaustive check of the references gave a couple of erros (e.g., ref 14 is missing
one author, and ref 19 has two authors that were not part of the publication [Pettorelli and
Penteriani]. I would recommend a careful and thorough revision of the references.
Figure caption, figure 1: since there was really only one continuous survey, perheps use singular
instead, or delete the word “surveys” altogether
Figure caption, figure 2: Here the term “Surveys” are used again. I would recommend that the
use of the term is explained here, since normally it designates discrete sampling events (either in
space or time), not temporal divisions of a continuous sampling period.
Table 2. I find these data quite illuminating, and worth a wider description in the text. For
instance, the beta values indicate an average loss of 1 ad male every 3 years, 1 ad female every 1.5
years, and approx 1 animal every 6 months. What does this rate of population reduction, given
the estimated population sizes, say about the longevity of the population given current
conditions? Also, since the slope is really the most interesting part of these regressions (the
intercept is largely defined by the pop size estimate, and are not even mentioned here, which I
think is completely appropriate), I would argue that the beta evaluation would be more
appropriate to report than the variance test, i.e. the t, df (or SE) and p for the beta coefficient.

Comments to the Author:
This is an important short paper for conservation purposes, notably as it documents
anthropogenic causes of mortality, and highlights how trophy hunting potentially exacerbates an
already bad situation. In addition to the referees' comments, I would like to see a little more
background on how certain factors affect the survey results, notably home range (what is it,
typically?) and population structure (the authors say they assessed this but some general
background for readers on what constitutes a leopard "population" and how this relates to the
animals in the study area, would be helpful). This, together with some better caveats on the
limitations of the data set, may help to address Referee 2's comments. Notably these:

"The area studied was quite small ( 59 to 73 km2) and was not held constant across years of study:
these issues limit the inference that can validly be drawn from highly localized changes in
density... With only 8 individuals under study and only 4 known mortalities, inferences about the
relative importance of different causes of death are not credible."
I don't think these are fatal flaws in the study, but these limitations do need to be explicitly
identified, and the scope of the paper's conclusions reduced accordingly. The importance of this
paper is less in the density estimates (which have limited value in light of the issues above) and
more in the message for conservation managers regarding general decline and sources of
mortality.

4 Abstract
5 Data on the population dynamics and threats to large carnivores are vital to conservation
6 efforts, but these are hampered by a paucity of studies. For some species, such as the
7 leopard (Panthera pardus), there is such uncertainty on population trends that leopard
8 trophy hunting was banned in South Africa in 2016 while further data on leopard
9 abundance are collected. We present one of the first assessments of leopard population
10 dynamics, and identify the key threats to a population of leopards outside of protected
11 areas in South Africa. We conducted 24 camera trap surveys between 2012 and 2016 in
12 the Soutpansberg Mountains, and drew on a previous estimate of leopard population
13
density for the region from 2008. In each survey we estimated the population density
14
15
and assessed population structure. We fitted eight leopards with GPS collars to assess
16 threats to the population. Leopard population density declined by 66%, from 10.73 to
17 3.65 leopards per 100 km² in 2008 and 2016 respectively. Collared leopards had a high
18 mortality rate due to illegal human activity. While improving the management of trophy
19 hunting is important, we suggest that mitigating human-wildlife conflict could have a
20 bigger impact on carnivore conservation.

28 1. Introduction
29 Large mammalian carnivores are incredibly important to human societies. People tell
30 stories about large carnivores in traditional fables, their likenesses inspire artwork, they
31 play roles in witchcraft, and their products are used in traditional rituals and medicine [1].
32 They are among the most sought after species by tourists [2, 3] and they are of great
33 economic significance through the tourism and hunting industries [4, 5]. Carnivores are
34 also incredibly important to ecosystems and environments. As apex predators, the
35
extirpation of carnivores can trigger trophic cascades that can reduce biodiversity [6],
36
37
increase the transmission of infectious diseases to humans [7], increase crop damage
38 [8], reduce carbon sequestration [9], and even modify river morphology [10]. But despite
39 their value, 59% of large carnivores are now threatened with extinction [11], and this will
40 be exacerbated as humans continue to modify the environment [12]. Carnivores
41 frequently come into conflict with humans [13, 14], and anthropogenic threats such as
42 persecution [15], loss of habitat, and decline in prey base [16] have led to massive
43 population declines and range contractions for most large carnivores [17].
44
45 On average, large carnivore species have lost 53% of their historic range [17]. For some
46 species this range loss has been much greater, with the leopard (Panthera pardus)
47 having lost 63-75% of its historic range worldwide [18] and 80% of its past range in
48
South Africa [19], the most extensive decline in southern Africa [18]. As a consequence,
49
50 the leopard has recently been uplisted to Vulnerable on both the global IUCN Red List
51 [20] and the Red List of Mammals of South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho [21],
52 highlighting an increasing concern over its conservation status.
53
54 Although it is clear that the range of leopards is contracting, there is a dearth of long-
55 term data on population size and threats faced by leopards [18]. Insufficient data also
56 hinders the management of other carnivores such as the brown hyaena (Hyaena

3 brunnea) [22] and black-footed cat (Felis nigripes) [23]. In South Africa, there is an
4
urgent need to determine the population trends of leopards to inform leopard
5
6 management [24], and there is such uncertainty about the abundance of leopards that
7 leopard trophy hunting was banned in South Africa in 2016 while robust data are sought
8 in order to allow hunting quotas to be set at sustainable levels [18]. This is especially
9 pertinent given the high degree of public scrutiny on trophy hunting of large carnivores in
10 Africa [25] in the wake of the recent controversial hunt of Cecil the lion (Panthera leo) in
11 Zimbabwe [26]. Research that assists leopard management is considered a priority [27],
12 such as determining the population density and trends, demography, and identifying any
13 threats to the population [24, 28].
14
15 Assessing leopard population trends, demography and threats is particularly important
16 outside of state protected areas, such as on private land. In South Africa 68% of
17
remaining leopard habitat is outside of legally protected areas [19], and leopard
18
19 conservation efforts should be focused outside of protected areas [19], where leopards
20 are most at risk [29]. Furthermore, leopard management strategies are focused on
21 regulating legal and illegal utilization of leopards, most of which occurs outside protected
22 areas. One area likely to be of great importance to leopard conservation is the
23 Soutpansberg Mountains in South Africa, of which very little is formally protected [30].
24 The Soutpansberg Mountains are a biodiversity hotspot [31], supporting high species
25 diversity [32, 33] including in 2008 one of the highest reported densities of leopards in
26 Africa [34]. The current population density, population trends, changes in leopard
27 demography, and threats to this leopard population are, however, unknown. We present
28 the first estimates of trends in leopard population density and abundance in the
29 Soutpansberg Mountains as a case study to inform future research and management
30
focusing on large carnivore population dynamics. We also assess changes in the
31
32 demographics of the population, and identify key threats.

38
39 2.1. Study area
40
41 The study was conducted in the western Soutpansberg Mountains, Limpopo Province,
42 South Africa. The mountains cover an area of 6,800 km² [33] and study site (central
43 coordinates S29.44031° E23.02217°) elevation varied from 750 m to 1,748 m above sea
44
level [35]. Climate was characterized by a warm, wet season (October to March) and a
45
46
cool, dry season (April to September) [36]. Land uses included a private nature reserve,
47 ecotourism, hunting, and farming of livestock, game and crops. Most of the land was
48 privately owned, but community owned land was also present within the area.

52 2.2. Spatially explicit capture recapture
53
54 An array of Reconyx Hyperfire HC500 and HC600 camera traps was established to
55 estimate trends in leopard population density and demography. Forty-eight camera traps
56 were placed in pairs at 23 camera trap stations across the study site, encompassing the

4
locations throughout study, but five stations were relocated due to the withdrawal of one
5
6 landowner in 2013 (Figure 1, Table A1), reducing the area covered by the cameras from
7 73 km² to 59 km². Camera trap stations were situated on roads, drainage lines, and
8 game trails where leopard signs had been recorded, to maximize the probability of
9 photographing leopards. A maximum spacing of 3 km between camera traps stations
10 was used [34] to ensure that there were no gaps in the array large enough to
11 encompass the entire home range of an adult female leopard, so that all individuals had
12 a capture probability greater than zero [37, 38]. Camera traps were mounted on trees or
13 poles approximately 40 cm above the ground. Vegetation was cleared at regular
14 intervals from around the cameras to reduce the number of false photographic captures.
15 The cameras ran continuously, with the minimum delay between captures
16 (approximately one second). Camera trap surveys were conducted between 01/01/2012
17
and 02/01/2016 (Table A2). Each camera trap was visited every two to four weeks to
18
19 change batteries, ensure that the cameras remained operational, and to download the
20 photographs. Individual leopards were identified from photographs using their unique
21 coat pattern, and were allocated into adult male, adult female, and juvenile categories
22 using body size, the appearance of external genitalia, and secondary sexual
23 characteristics such as build and the dewlap [39]. Adults were defined as at least two
24 years old, and sub-adults were excluded from density estimation [34].
25
26 Camera trap data were analysed following [34] in order to enable comparisons. Data on
27 the locations and trapping occasions on which individual leopards were captured were
28 used to create a spatially explicit capture-recapture model [40] employing a Bayesian
29 framework [41] to estimate leopard density using SPACECAP v 1.0.1 [42] in R v 3.3.0
30
[43]. The duration of each trapping occasion was set at 24 hours and the dataset was
31
32 divided up into 24 study periods, each lasting 60 days, with each study period separated
33 by 1 day (Table A2). A state space pixel size of 0.25 km² was used, and a buffer of 20
34 km around the camera traps was employed to encompass the home ranges of all
35 leopards that were photographed [44]. Potential home range centers were scored as
36 unsuitable habitat when they overlapped with urban areas. Spatial capture recapture
37 models were constructed using the Bernoulli encounter process and half normal
38 detection function. Between 100,000 and 200,000 iterations were used in the Markov-
39 chain Monte Carlo simulation, along with a burn-in of 50,000-80,000 iterations, a thinning
40 rate of 5-10, and data augmentation of 200-700 individuals. Model parameters were
41 adjusted until convergence was good (Geweke z-scores were between -1.6 and 1.6)
42
[45], Bayesian P-values did not approach 0 or 1 [46], and data augmentation, state
43
space extent and sample size were sufficiently large (see S3 Table) [42]. Population
44
45 structure was assessed by summing the number of unique individuals of each age sex
46 class photographed in each survey. Trends in population density and demography were
47 analysed using linear regression, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to assess
48 differences in the number of surveys for which adult males and adult females remained
49 present, using R v 3.3.0. All data underlying the analyses are publically available [47].

7 adult leopards (Table 1). The collars recorded the coordinates of the study animals at
8 200-minute intervals and were fitted with activity sensors that triggered a mortality signal
9 when no movement was detected for 24 hours. The data were transmitted to the users
10 by UHF radio link, and also over the mobile GSM network by SMS, enabling the study
11 animals to be located quickly after death to determine the cause. The collars were also
12 fitted with VHF transmitters to enable locating of collared animals in real time. Collars

21
22 3.1. Population dynamics
23
24 A total of 16 adult male leopards and 28 adult females were photographed. Twenty-one
25 sub-adults were also recorded, of which three became adult males and one an adult
26 female during the course of the study. The mean adult male to adult female sex ratio
27 was 1:1.65. The tenure of each individual leopard is shown in Figure 2. There was no
28 difference in the number of surveys for which adult males and adult females remained
29 present (W = 276.5, df = 1, P = 0.5276). The number of adult males identified in each
30 study period remained stable, while the number of adult females, cubs and total number
31
of leopards declined significantly between 2012 and 2016 (Figure 3, Table 2).
32
33
34 Leopard density in the Soutpansberg ranged from 6.55 in 2012 to 3.65 in 2016 (Table
35 A2). Leopard density declined linearly across the study (F(1,22) = 22.04, P < 0.001, R² =
36 0.501) with a decline of 44% over approximately four years (a reduction of 0.75 leopards
37 per 100 km2 every year). Incorporating the density estimate available in [34] produced a
38 similar model (F(1,22) = 57.66, P < 0.001, R² = 0.715), but indicated a 66% decline over a
39 period just over seven and a half years (0.87 leopards 100 km2 per year).
40
41
42
43 3.2. Individual monitoring
44
45 Only two of eight leopards collared (25.0%) survived to the end of the 455-day collaring
46 period. Three were killed by snares (37.5%) and one was shot without a permit for
47 perceived cattle predation (12.5%). Two collared leopards went missing (25%),
48
suspected dead, since they disappeared from the camera trap photographs at the same
49
50
time.

54 4. Discussion
55 Leopard population density in the western Soutpansberg in 2012 (6.55 animals per 100
56 km²) was similar to published values at other sites [49-51], but by 2016 had dropped
57

1
2
3 substantially to 3.65 animals per 100 km². This also contrasts with the relatively high
4
densities reported for the area in 2008 [34]. The density of leopards in the Soutpansberg
5
6 Mountains has decreased by 44% since 2012 and by 66% since 2008, an extremely
7 rapid decline. If this trend continues at the same rate, the population will essentially
8 disappear from the Soutpansberg Mountains before 2020.
9
10 There are very few other studies of population trends of leopards with which to compare
11 this decline [18, 24]. The only other comparable study estimated a 56% increase in the
12 density of leopards in Phinda Private Game Reserve, South Africa, over four years due
13 to management interventions [52]. Nevertheless, studies on lions [53] and on black-
14 backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis) [54] have
15 noted similar trends where populations have been monitored over multiple years,
16 suggesting the declines in the density of African carnivores exemplify global trends [17].
17
18
19 The decline observed in leopard density appeared to be driven by a decrease in the
20 number of adult females, while the number of adult males was more stable. Although
21 sub-adults were excluded from the density estimates, the number of sub-adults
22 photographed also declined over the course of the study, most likely linked to the decline
23 in adult females photographed. Low sub-adult survival rates would reinforce the
24 population decline, making a future recovery less likely without compensatory
25 immigration. The reasons why the number of males photographed per survey remained
26 stable while the number of females and sub-adults photographed was declining is not
27 clear, as we did not expect the main threats to the population to affect adult males less
28 than adult females. Declines in the number of adult males could have been masked by
29 the maturation of sub-adults into adult males; during the course of the study three sub-
30
adults matured into adult males, while only one sub-adult matured into an adult female.
31
32 Furthermore, only three adult males were photographed the final two surveys, the lowest
33 level of all 24 surveys. Continued monitoring will allow determination of whether a
34 negative trend in the number of adult males is also evident in the population.
35
36 The death of six collared leopards over the 455-day period for which each collar was
37 deployed indicated a very high rate of mortality. Death was the most likely explanation
38 for the collared leopards that went missing, as we stopped receiving data from their
39 collars at the same time as they stopped appearing in images on the camera traps.
40 Emigration or collar failure are thus unlikely. Instead it is probable that they died either in
41 an area where the signals would be obscured (such as in a cave), or the collars were
42
destroyed deliberately, indicating anthropogenic mortality. Illegal hunting was the sole
43
cause of the known deaths of collared leopards. Furthermore, local conservation actions
44
45 are known to have prevented poisoning of one collared leopard following a livestock
46 predation event, without which mortality rates would have been higher.
47
48 Our data indicate that illegal human activity is the primary cause of leopard mortality in
49 the study area, often in retaliation to perceived livestock predation or for bushmeat, and
50 this is driving steep declines in the leopard population. Anthropogenic mortality is often
51 the biggest threat to leopards outside of protected areas [14] and similar results have
52 been reported for other large carnivores [29, 55, 56]. The sex ratio was similar to other
53 sites [49, 57], and was not indicative of overexploitation of males through trophy hunting
54 [58]. As reported in the Waterberg District Municipality in South Africa [59, 60], legal
55
mechanisms of leopard removal such as trophy hunting and damage causing animal
56
removals appear to be less important threats to the leopard population than illegal

3 activities such as snaring [14] in the Soutpansberg. Snaring can be a serious threat to
4
large carnivores, and additional research is required to fully understand the impact of this
5
6 on large felids [61].
7
8 In this case study, the leading causes of leopard mortality were snaring, shooting and
9 poisoning, either in response to the perceived risk of livestock predation or poaching for
10 bushmeat or animal parts. In this case we thus recommend increasing efforts to engage
11 with local communities to reduce the level of these activities, for example through
12 education [62] and enhancing livestock husbandry [63, 64]. Efforts to reduce human-
13 carnivore conflict can be very successful at promoting the recovery of leopard
14 populations [52]. Further investigations, drawing on approaches from the social sciences
15 [65], into the underlying causes of illegal activity leading to leopard mortality should also
16 be undertaken in order to guide conservation actions. Effective strategies for managing
17
damage causing animals should also be developed and adhered to [24], such as the
18
19 draft national norms and standards recently published for South Africa [66].
20
21 Although retaliatory killings may present the largest threats to leopard populations
22 outside protected areas [60], this study calls into question the sustainability of additive
23 off take through legal mechanisms of leopard removals such as trophy hunting and
24 damage causing animal destruction permits [67]. Furthermore, trophy hunting of large
25 carnivores can be associated with elevated levels of human-wildlife conflict and
26 increased mortality from persecution [68]. Declines in leopard density may also increase
27 human-wildlife conflict through the mesopredator release effect [69] since caracals
28 (Caracal caracal), black-backed jackals, and baboons are responsible for significant
29 agricultural damage [70]. Since leopards cause less livestock damage than farmers
30
perceive [71], this would result in elevated levels of livestock and crop damage and
31
32 increased retaliatory killing.
33
34 In some cases, trophy hunting can be the main driver of population declines [52, 55],
35 and improved management of leopard trophy hunting is urgently required [24]. Before
36 the national ban on trophy hunting leopards came into effect in 2016 [18] leopards were
37 over-harvested in South Africa [72], which was partly responsible for predicted
38 population declines [60]. An adaptive management system for managing leopards in
39 South Africa is currently being developed, and much effort to date has centered on the
40 regulation of leopard trophy hunting [73]. Under the new adaptive management system,
41 before the trophy hunting ban female leopards were removed from hunting quotas and
42
leopard hunting effort was spread across leopard hunting zones [72] in relation to
43
leopard habitat suitability [19]. If the ban is lifted we recommend closure of the hunting
44
45 zones [72] in which leopard populations are declining until the population has recovered.
46 Such an approach will require intensive monitoring. In order to assess trends in
47 carnivore population density we advocate conducting multiple surveys over several
48 years, as this mitigates the problem of variation in estimates and enables determination
49 of population trends with a high degree of confidence. Few other studies have attempted
50 this, with most calculating a single point estimate [34, 49, 50] rather than conducting
51 multiple surveys over time [but see 52, 54].

4 5. Conclusions
5 The density of leopards in the case study declined by 66% over seven and a half years.
6 The number of adult males was relatively stable, while the number of adult females and
7 cubs declined over the course of the study. Illegal anthropogenic threats such as
8 snaring, shooting and poisoning was the main threat to the population. To date much
9 attention has focused on improving trophy hunting of large carnivores, but our data
10 suggest that and the importance of other sources of anthropogenic mortality should not
11
be overlooked, and efforts to mitigate these threats could have a bigger impact on the
12
conservation status of large carnivores than improving legal trophy hunting.

Re: Manuscript RSOS-161090
Dear Drs Power and Padian,
Thank you for your feedback and for passing on the comments from the reviewers on our
manuscript RSOS-161090 entitled "Population dynamics and threats to an apex predator
outside protected areas: Implications for carnivore management". We are delighted that it
has been accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science, subject to minor
revisions.
We provide responses (in red) to the queries and suggestions below, and have attempted
to incorporate the recommendations of the reviewers into the revised manuscript.
We feel that these changes have improved the paper and are grateful for the suggestions.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require any additional information.
Yours sincerely,
Dr Sam Williams
Comments to the Author:
This is an important short paper for conservation purposes, notably as it documents
anthropogenic causes of mortality, and highlights how trophy hunting potentially
exacerbates an already bad situation. In addition to the referees' comments, I would like
to see a little more background on how certain factors affect the survey results, notably
home range (what is it, typically?) and population structure (the authors say they assessed
this but some general background for readers on what constitutes a leopard "population"
and how this relates to the animals in the study area, would be helpful). This, together
with some better caveats on the limitations of the data set, may help to address Referee
2's comments. Notably these:
We have added information on the home range size of female leopards (lines 155-158).
We have also added background on leopard populations (lines 105-108, 342-346, 377-
383).
"The area studied was quite small (59 to 73 km2) and was not held constant across years
of study: these issues limit the inference that can validly be drawn from highly localized
changes in density... With only 8 individuals under study and only 4 known mortalities,
inferences about the relative importance of different causes of death are not credible."
I don't think these are fatal flaws in the study, but these limitations do need to be
explicitly identified, and the scope of the paper's conclusions reduced accordingly. The
importance of this paper is less in the density estimates (which have limited value in light
of the issues above) and more in the message for conservation managers regarding general
decline and sources of mortality.
We accept that it is unfortunate that the size of the study area did not remain constant
over the course of the study, but access permissions to certain properties meant that this
was not feasible. We have taken greater care to highlight the limitations of our study in
the revisions of our manuscript (line 385-388, 398-400, 464).

Comments to the Author(s)
I consider this paper very important because it focus on an endangered large carnivore
that may experience threats in their populations, even in areas that are still considered as
potentially favourable to the presence of high density populations. Moreover, as correctly
highlighted by the authors, it is crucial to assess large carnivore population trends,
demography and threats outside of protected areas, such as the case of leopards in South
African private land.
The study is relatively simple but well-done, and its main interest is in the fact that the
authors have been able to highlight the problems that large carnivores may experience
outside protected areas.
All my suggestions/changes are reported as comments within the PDf file (attached to
this revision)
We thank the reviewer for their very positive comments on our manuscript. We have
copied their comments from the pdf to highlights our responses below.

I would start with this section, then continue with ecotourism and, finally, talk about
their iamportance for human society/people culture. This is probably a better starting for
this journal
We have revised the order of the sentences in the opening paragraph as suggested (lines
50-58).
You need to add a section on statystical analyses
We have added the section as suggested (section 2.4, lines 260-283)
You should clarify why you specifically focused here on the home range of adult females
only
We have added detail on why we focussed on the home range size of female leopards, and
provided information on the size of female leopard home ranges (lines 156-158).
Vegetation was cleared at regular intervals from around the cameras to reduce the
number of false photographic captures.
We have deleted this sentence as suggested.
More specific information on the drop-off device e.g. brand, how it works,... are
necessary here
We provided further information on the manufacturer and operation of the drop-off
device (lines 182-258)
number of adult females…”
I would suggest to expand this section, even speculations are only possible. Is there any
trait in the life-history of males vs. females that could explain that only the number of
females declined? For example, might movements within the home range, home range
shifts or reproduction affect the results you got by camaras? Not all readers will be
familiar with the study species, and more details are important to support your results
We are reluctant to speculate too much given the limits of our data. Nevertheless, we
have added some further discussion of this topic (lines 377-383).
Without more details in the map, this figure is not really necessary. Moreover, it is not
clear where is your study are within the square on the left of the colour image, it seems
like there are three areas
The figure is much clearer when viewed at full resolution and we suspect that the
confusion relates to the lower resolution of the image in the review pdf.
This table [Table 1] is not really necessary within the main text, I would suggest to
present it as a Supplemental File
We have moved Table 1 to Supplementary Information, and renamed it Table A3. The
only remaining table in the manuscript (previously called Table 2) has now been renamed
Table 1.
I am not sure if this is a mistake, but the sample size is F1,22 within the text, whereas
here is reported F1,21. Is this correct? Because there is no information on statistical
procedures, it is quite difficult to follow these results
Thank you for pointing out this mistake. We have corrected F(1,21) to F(1,22) in Table 1
(formerly labelled Table 2). We have also corrected F(1,22) to F(1,23) on line 324.

Comments to the Author(s)
Strengths:
Statistically appropriate use of capture-recapture models with camera trap data to
describe a decline in leopard density. The paper is well written.
Weaknesses:
This study did not conduct 24 camera trap surveys as the abstract states, it conducted one
survey with 24 trap stations,
can be used to estimate animal density at different points in time, in addition to at
different geographical locations. Nevertheless, we have replaced survey with sampling
period throughout the manuscript to avoid confusion.
The area studied was quite small ( 59 to 73 km2) and was not held constant across years of
study: these issues limit the inference that can validly be drawn from highly localized
changes in density.
We accept that the area covered by the camera trapping array could be larger, and it was
unfortunate that we were forced to relocate 5 of the 23 camera stations part way through
the study due to the withdrawal of one landowner. Although the survey area is larger
than many published studies we have nevertheless ensured that the conclusions we have
drawn are consistent with the scope of our sampling area (line 385-388, 398-400, 464).
With only 8 individuals under study and only 4 known mortalities, inferences about the
relative importance of different causes of death are not credible. The discussion therefore
goes far beyond the limited scope of inference that would be supported by these data. I
would suggest that the data on density are better suited to a brief note in a more specialist
journal, with more cautious inferences, and no inferences about cause-specific mortality
from a sample of 4 deaths.
We have taken greater care to highlight the limitations of our study in the revisions of
our manuscript (line 385-388, 398-400, 464).

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very well written manuscript that presents valuable data on the demographics of
a leopard population in northern South Africa. I only some suggestions for minor
editorial revisions, outlined below.
We thank the reviewer for their very positive comments on the manuscript.
Abstract, second sentence: Replace “on” with “in” “...uncertainty in population trends...”
We have amended this word (line 32).
Section 2.1 Although I find it correct to use the past tense in the first sentence, since it
refers to the study, I would argue that the rest of this section should be written in the
present tense, i.e. “...elevation varies from...”, “Climate is characterized...” and so on
the first sentence (lines 131-134).
Page 4, first paragraph. Although it later becomes obvious that there is really only one
survey, i.e. the cameras ran for the duration of the study period, this is not obvious here. I
would recommend to combine the sentences on rows 12-14: “The cameras ran
continuously between 01/01/2012 and 02/01/2016, with the minimal delay between
captures (approximately one second) (Table A2).” Perhaps also consider to alter the data
format to avoid confusing of days and months (e.g. “1 January 2012)”
We have changed the text as suggested (line 160). We also changed the date format to
YYYY-MM-DD throughout the manuscript and associated files to avoid confusion.
Page 5, first paragraph. Although the ethical permit for the study is mentioned at the end
of the manuscript, perhaps mention it briefly here as well, at least state that the captures
were done following appropriate ethical and administrative permits.
We have added the information on permits at the location suggested (lines 185-258).
References. A not exhaustive check of the references gave a couple of erros (e.g., ref 14 is
missing one author, and ref 19 has two authors that were not part of the publication
[Pettorelli and Penteriani]. I would recommend a careful and thorough revision of the
references.
We have corrected the references listed, and checked the rest of the bibliography for
errors.
Figure caption, figure 1: since there was really only one continuous survey, perheps use
singular instead, or delete the word “surveys” altogether
Throughout the manuscript we have replaced the term survey with sampling period to
remove the confusion.
Figure caption, figure 2: Here the term “Surveys” are used again. I would recommend that
the use of the term is explained here, since normally it designates discrete sampling
events (either in space or time), not temporal divisions of a continuous sampling period.
As above, we have replaced the term survey with sampling period.
Table 2. I find these data quite illuminating, and worth a wider description in the text.
For instance, the beta values indicate an average loss of 1 ad male every 3 years, 1 ad
female every 1.5 years, and approx 1 animal every 6 months. What does this rate of
population reduction, given the estimated population sizes, say about the longevity of the
population given current conditions? Also, since the slope is really the most interesting
not even mentioned here, which I think is completely appropriate), I would argue that
the beta evaluation would be more appropriate to report than the variance test, i.e. the t,
df (or SE) and p for the beta coefficient.
The first paragraph of the discussion discusses the implications of the population trends.
We have updated Table 2 (now renamed Table 1) to also include the standard error, t and
P values in addition to the estimate for the coefficients.
