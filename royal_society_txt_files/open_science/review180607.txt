Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The title is innovate and informative. Similarly, the abstract also gives a good summary.
However, in the Line 30-31, I think the author should clearly clarify if the offspring vigour of C.
virgata was also studied under different precipitation regimes?
Introduction part gives a good review on current state, such as the trade-off, seed traits and
advance of reproductive strategy.
The title is reproductive strategy of this species, but the author stated the trade-off at the
beginning of the second section in introduction. I think the author should explain or add some
references here.
Line 46-51 I thin authors need add reference into the first graph in introduction.
Line 48 delete one “variable”
Line 67-69 “C. virgata is, therefore, a valuable species for promising grass species in salinity-
alkalinity and drought-stressed environments”. This sentence should be add a reference.
Materials and methods are acceptable. My question is why you chose this species, before the
experiment, did you have some pre-experiment or according to the other reports?
Line 90 the sentence: respectively than the average baseline on the data from the Songnen
grassland, should be: respectively, than the average baseline on the data from the Songnen
grassland.
Line 94 should delete “the”.
Line 110-111 The sentence: The seed number of each plant was approximated by dividing the
seed yield by the mean seed size. How the author calculates the seed size?
Line 93-94 The final number of pipe was 4 for each precipitation level, giving 20 individuals. In
fact, the author mentioned there were 8 pipes. But what of the pipe number?
Results and discussion are clear, supported by the data.
Line 188 The spike number includes two parts in this study, while if in other environment the
spike number will different?
Line 204-205 The sentence: “This indicates that precipitation is the vital factor that affects this
species’growth and reproduction. Did author research on other factors, for example nitrogen,
temperature or extreme weather? Or the author want to say: precipitaion is one of the vital factor
that affects this species.
Reference P 13-17 Please check the format of the journal and revised the references as the journal
requirement. In addition, you can delete some older ones if they are not so important.

The author showed the reproductive strategy in Chloris virgata under different precipitation
conditions. C. virgata is so important in recovering bare patches of alkaline soil in Songnen plain.
Overall, I think the aim of the paper is interesting and worth pursuing. However, there are still
some flaws need further work (particularly the results and discussion) and clarification. I suggest
this paper can be published after revision.
1. Line 27-31 These sentences not good, needs to rewrite it.
2. Line 39-40. The conclusion too general, needs further more work on it.
3. Line 104 “all the spikes from each plant put into individual paper bags” should be: all the
spikes from each plant were put into individual paper bags.
4. Line 109 Is seed weight right?
5. Line 98-111 The authors mentioned that spike weight, seed weight, seed size. However, seed
mass and spike mass were only mentioned in the figures? Why?
6. In the data analysis, please list the indicators that used to analyze the allometric relationship.
Move “All analyses were…USA)” to the end of this section.
6. How to calculate seed mass and non-seed mass?.
7. Figure 4 Seed weight and non-seed weight were listed in the figure. However, both of them
cannot find in the legend.
8. Please showed the results of mean 1 SD in some figures and tables.
9. In discussion, there are some results that are not discussed, for example, those presented in
figure 1. These findings are quite interesting, particularly looking at the numbers of reproductive
vs non-reproductive tillers. Why?
10. Line 177. Move this sub-title below the “Disscussion”.
11. Line 246. Does not this conclusion from your experiment? If yes, delete ref. If not, need to
summary your results and get a new one.
Please revise the reference style according to the journal requirements.
12. Figure 1. Need to indicate the meaning of L, T, H in the legend. And, the X and Y-axis’ labs
were too small. Revise these flaws throughout the paper.
13. Figure 4. Move texts “there were four… 20 individuals” to Data analysis section.

2. The title is reproductive strategy of this species, but the
author stated the trade-off at the beginning of the second

# We have revised it in the manuscript.
Trade-off is one of the fundamental features for plants and exists
in ecological strategies (She et al., 2017).
3. Line 46-51 I think authors need add reference into the first

# We have added reference into the first graph in introduction.

6. Materials and methods are acceptable. My question is

Comments to the Author(s)
The author showed the reproductive strategy in Chloris virgata
under different precipitation conditions. C. virgata is so important
in recovering bare patches of alkaline soil in Songnen plain.
Overall, I think the aim of the paper is interesting and worth
pursuing. However, there are still some flaws need further work
(particularly the results and discussion) and clarification. I
suggest this
1. Line 27-31 These sentences not good, needs to rewrite it.
# We have rewritten it.
Total 20 individuals for each treatment were analyzed to
compare tiller number, spike traits, seed traits, the relationship
between seed size and seed number, and so on. In addition, the
effects of different precipitation regimes on offspring vigour of
C. virgata were also studied.
2. Line 39-40. The conclusion too general, needs further
more work on it.
# Thanks for your good advice. We have revised it in the
manuscript.
These findings showed that different precipitation regimes
affected reproductive strategy of C. virgata. C. virgata will not
benefit from low precipitation, while typical and high precipitation
will improve seed traits and offspring vigour of this species.
3. Line 104 “all the spikes from each plant put into individual
paper bags” should be: all the spikes from each plant were
put into individual paper bags.
# We have revised it.
4. Line 109 Is seed weight right?
# Thanks for your valuable advice. It should be seed mass.
5. Line 98-111 The authors mentioned that spike weight,
seed weight, seed size. However, seed mass and spike
mass were only mentioned in the figures? Why?
# We have rewritten all the indicators in the manuscript.
6. In the data analysis, please list the indicators that used to
analyze the allometric relationship. Move “All analyses
were…USA)” to the end of this section.
# Thank you for your advice. We revised them.
7. How to calculate seed mass and non-seed mass?
# Thanks for the reviewer. We have listed them in material and
methods part.
Seed mass: mass of seed produced by a plant;
Non-seed mas: total above-ground mass excluding seed mass.
8. Figure 4 Seed weight and non-seed weight were listed in
the figure. However, both of them cannot find in the legend.
# We have revised them. We used seed mass and non-seed
mass in the whole manuscript and deleted all seed weight and
non-seed weight.
9. Please showed the results of mean 1 SD in some figures
and tables.
# We have drew the pictures and tables again. But the pictures
looked not so better because the number was 20, which made
SD was a little higher. So I kept the pictures with s.e. also. In fact,
we also use s.e. in data analysis because the sample number is
big in ecology.
And we remain the pictures and tables with s.e.
10. In discussion, there are some results that are not
discussed, for example, those presented in figure 1. These
findings are quite interesting, particularly looking at the
numbers of reproductive vs non-reproductive tillers. Why?
# We have discussed them in the manuscript.
11. Line 177. Move this sub-title below the “Disscussion”.
# We have revised it.
12. Line 246. Does not this conclusion from your experiment?
If yes, delete ref. If not, need to summary your results and
get a new one.
# We have deleted the reference according to your advice.
13. Please revise the reference style according to the
journal requirements.
# We have revised the reference style in content and reference
according to the journal requirements.
14. Figure 1. Need to indicate the meaning of L, T, H in the
legend. And, the X and Y-axis’ labs were too small. Revise
these flaws throughout the paper.
# We have revised them in the material and methods part and
results part, also in the results.
There were three treatments, corresponding to 120 (L: low), 200
(T: typical), and 280 (H: high) mm precipitation.
