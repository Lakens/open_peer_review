This study explores the importance of considering indirect indirections while modeling airborne
transmitting infections through contact networks. The contact network is realistic as it is based on
data from social media app momo. The study finds that the inclusion of indirect links increases
disease diffusion through contact networks. Although these results are obvious, I find the results
on LST and LDT networks particularly interesting since they indicate that the impact of indirect
links on disease diffusion is more complex than just increasing network’s link density.
I enjoyed reading the manuscript and think it makes an important contribution to the literature. I
have a few comments to help improve the clarity of the results presented in the study.
Abstract:
(1) I suggest mentioning the exciting result that indirect links increase diffusion even if
underlying connectivity in the SPST and SPDT network is the same.
(2) I also agree with previous reviewers that abstract could focus on how (a) SPDT models are
more realistic for airborne disease and/or (b) diffusion dynamics of an airborne disease cannot be
reproduced by the current SPST models.
(3) Please note that clarifying the superiority of SPDT over SPST for airborne transmission is
important. The current phrasing makes it seem that the SPST model is inadequate for all
infectious diseases which is certainly not true. For example, the SPST model is adequate for
sexually transmitted disease, infectious diseases that spread by physical contact, etc.
(4) What does increasing the dynamics of disease imply? Do the authors mean increase disease
“diffusion rate” instead?
(5) “networks with low link densities”. Unless I misunderstood, this statement is referring to the
sparse SPDT/SPST networks. Based on the results, I don’t see how sparse SPDT model
“particularly” increases disease diffusion. For instance, results (page 10 line 50) states that “the
impact of SPDT model becomes stronger in the dense DDT network). The impact of DDT
networks is also much higher in Figure 7 compared with SDT networks. Please clarify.
Introduction:
(6) It would be useful to discuss how the current model formulation conceptually differs from
previous SPDT model in the literature by Richardson and Gorochowski (2015).
(7) Page 5, line 38-39: How exactly were the links reconstructed for missing days? By repeating
the same links as the last available day with movement data, or by taking an “average” link
behavior over all days where the data were available?
Methods:
(8) How is amplification calculated? It does not appear to be simply = (disease outcome for SPDT
models/ disease outcome for SPST model) because in that case amplification by dense SPDT
model will be more than sparse SPDT model (Figure 4A)? Please clarify and mention the
calculations in the main text.
3
Results:
(9) Page 9, line 57-58: I wouldn’t consider Re for dense SPDT model to be strong compared to
dense SPST model, because the interquartile ranges of DST and DDT overlap for all values of rt in
Figure 4C. Is there perhaps another explanation for why outbreak sizes are amplified up to 4.3
times in the dense networks?
Discussion:
(10) It’s strange to see new results (Figures 8 and 9) being introduced in the discussion section.
Please move these to the results section.
Minor comments:
(1) Page 5, Line 7: “Contrasting disease”. Shouldn’t it be “contracting a disease”?
(2) Page 6, line 33-34: It is mentioned here that sparse SPST and SPDT networks will be denoted
as SST and SDT, yet the acronym usage is reverted back to SPST and SPDT in the same paragraph
and rest of the paper. Please be consistent in the usage of acronyms. If there is a difference
between SPST(SPDT) and SST(SPST), please clearly state the distinction.
(3) Page 7, line 45-46: “continuous reduction dies out the disease”. It is unclear what this means.
Please rephrase.
(4)
(5) Page 8, line 46: remove period after rt
(6) Page 8, line 47: It is unclear what “the same changes” mean with regards to the previous
statement.
(7) Figure 3 legend: spst and spdt should be in upper case. Also, these are referred to as SST and
SDT networks in the text. Please be consistent with the acronym usage.
(8) Figure 3C and D: What does the solid red line labeled as spdt represent? Where is it in the
figure?
(9) Figure 2 and 3: It will be easier to follow these figures if the same coloring scheme for rt values
is followed for all figures.
(10) Figure 4: Please change the y-axis label of 4A to “outbreak size” so that it is consistent with
the rest of the figures. “Total number of infections” can be mentioned in brackets as a definition.

Below are minor comments.
Abstract:
I much preferred the previous abstract. It was easier to read and had a nice flow to it. This
abstract needs cleaning up. i.e.
“Most of the current diffusion models only consider direct interactions among individuals to
build underlying infectious items transmission networks.”
1) I think it was fine to refer to these other models as “network models”.
2) “to build underlying infectious items transmission networks” is not clear. I think what you are
trying to say (which I agree with) is that ‘Most network models only consider direct contacts
capable of transmitting disease’
P 2. L41-52. There are a lot of abbreviations introduced, but not defined. I feel like much of this
should be in the methods section.
P 3 Line 16, Fig1 : define ‘L’ in the text (as the blue circle) and in the figure. Or leave it out
completely.
P 3. 57. Change ‘directed transmission’ to ‘direct transmission’
P 4. L7 “we integrate…” This sentence needs clarifying.
P4. 7-14. You use ‘proximity’ and ‘location L’ to represent the same think. Just use one.
P4. L42. change ‘an SPDT links’ to ‘SPDT links’. Make this change elsewhere as well (ie pg 5 L20,
‘an SPDT to a SPDT’).
P4. (2.8) Does ‘E’, overall exposure, include both direct and indirect links? As it is written, it looks
like it only includes indirect links. Please clarify. Should E not include both E_d and E_l?
P4. L59. This is the first time you have mentioned virus. Until this point you have kept the
infectious agent general. I would suggest continuing to do so, or state that you are modelling
viral dynamics earlier.
5
P5 L24-26. “When the host user’s last…” This is an important sentence and needs cleaning up/
clarification.
P5 L 26-17. Perhaps change “of last update” to “for up to 200 min since the last update” (?)
P5. L 49-50. ‘diffusion behaviours of SPDT model comparing to SPST model’. change to: ‘of the
SPDT model’ or ‘of SPDT models”… etc.
P6. Under Characterizing Metrics. The first sentence needs clarifying. I would not refer to I_n
and I_p as parameters. Also, what is the symbol for individuals recovered? Is this I_r (which you
use below?). Do the subscripts ‘n’ and ‘p’ implicitly represent time (simulation day)? Also can
you elaborate on how you take the average of Rt to get Re.
P7. L11. Is ‘r_t’ the same as ‘r’ defined above. Is the ‘t’ subscript indicative of decay time? I think
you may have confused decay rate with the lifespan of a particle. I would think that as particles
decay more quickly (ie the largest rate r_t=60), you would have fewer particles lingering about,
since they are decaying quickly. I am assuming that r_t is the lifespan, and r is the rate. Make this
clean and relabel the figure.
P9 L10-12. “…reaches to the individuals,…”
change to “reaches the higher degree individuals”
P9 L55 subscript on R missing.
P11 consider using different symbol for recovery and infectivity. You use \sigma for both. (see
top of P11 and (3.1). This becomes more confusing later on in your discussion on P14.

Response to the major comments of reviewer 1:
We are grateful and thank the reviewer 1 for spending time and making kind effort to review
our manuscripts. The comments are very helpful to improve our manuscripts. We have
explained our response to every comment based on our experiment results and relevant
literature. The comments are marked by blue colour and response is started with ‘Response’
word. The relevant changes in the text of our manuscript are quoted here with ‘…..’.
Abstract:
Comment-1: I suggest mentioning the exciting result that indirect links increase
diffusion even if underlying connectivity in the SPST and SPDT network is the
same.
Response: Thanks to the reviewer 1 for noticing the important point of our results. We have
included this important finding in the abstract of our manuscript. The relevant text is as follows:
‘Importantly, we also find that the diffusion dynamics including indirect links are not
reproducible by the current SPST models, even if both SPDT and SPST networks assume
the same underlying connectivity.’
Comment-2: I also agree with previous reviewers that abstract could focus on how (a) SPDT
models are more realistic for airborne disease and/or (b) diffusion dynamics of an airborne
disease cannot be reproduced by the current SPST models.
Response: This very important to reflect the finding of experiment. We would like to thank
reviewer 1 for addressing these issues. We have revised our abstract and included the
following arguments in the abstract.
‘By making the underlying connectivity denser and stronger due to the inclusion of indirect
transmissions, SPDT models are more realistic than SPST models that are in current studies
of various airborne diseases outbreaks.’
‘Importantly, we also find that the diffusion dynamics including indirect links are not
reproducible by the current SPST models, even if both SPDT and SPST networks assume the
same underlying connectivity. This is because the transmission dynamics of indirect links are
different from that of direct links.’
Comment-3: Please note that clarifying the superiority of SPDT over SPST for airborne
transmission is important. The current phrasing makes it seem that the SPST model is
inadequate for all infectious diseases which is certainly not true. For example, the SPST
model is adequate for sexually transmitted disease, infectious diseases that spread by
physical contact, etc.
Response: We have clarified this point rewriting our abstract as follows:
‘By making the underlying connectivity denser and stronger due to the inclusion of indirect
transmissions, SPDT models are more realistic than SPST models that are in current studies
of various airborne diseases outbreaks.’
Comment-4: What does increasing the dynamics of disease imply? Do the authors mean
increase disease “diffusion rate” instead?
Response: We have addressed this important comment and revised the text in abstract. Our
modified text is as follows:
‘The SPDT model significantly increases diffusion dynamics with a high rate of disease
transmission.’
Comment-5: “networks with low link densities”. Unless I misunderstood, this statement is
referring to the sparse SPDT/SPST networks. Based on the results, I don’t see how sparse
SPDT model “particularly” increases disease diffusion. For instance, results (page 10 line
50) states that “the impact of SPDT model becomes stronger in the dense DDT network).
The impact of DDT networks is also much higher in Figure 7 compared with SDT networks.
Please clarify.
Response: As this is not a key result of our experiments, we have removed this point from
the Abstract to avoid confusion.
Introduction:
Comment-6: It would be useful to discuss how the current model formulation conceptually
differs from previous SPDT model in the literature by Richardson and Gorochowski (2015).
Response: We would like to thank reviewer 1 for suggesting to include clarification on how the
proposed model differs from the previous SPDT model. We have clarified this point including
the corresponding argument. We have included the following text in 1st paragraph of Section
5.1 on p.14.
‘To our knowledge, the work of [16] has only considered the individual-level indirect
transmissions in diffusion phenomena. This model focused on environmental factors affecting
indirect transmission of infectious agents and the corresponding diffusion dynamics. In the
airborne disease spreading, however, we need to focus on individual movement behaviours
as well as their susceptibility and infectivity to the infectious agent. Moreover, this study did
not consider how the network properties and their impacts are changed by including indirect
transmission.’
Comment - 9 (Page 5, line 38-39): How exactly were the links reconstructed for missing days?
By repeating the same links as the last available day with movement data, or by taking an
“average” link behavior over all days where the data were available?
Response: This is the main mechanism to build our contact networks. Thanks to reviewer 1
for advising to add more explanation. In this process, all links from available days are picked
up and place to a random missing days. In this way, all missing day are filled up. This
preserves the randomness of link creation in reality. The revised text is in 2nd paragraph in
Section 3.2 of p.5 as follows:
‘In this process, all links of a day picked randomly from available days are copied to a
random missing day.’
Methods:
Comment-8: How is amplification calculated? It does not appear to be simply = (disease
outcome for SPDT models/ disease outcome for SPST model) because in that case
amplification by dense SPDT model will be more than sparse SPDT model (Figure 4A)?
Please clarify and mention the calculations in the main text.
Response: We have calculated the amplification for outbreak sizes. This is the ratio between
the outbreak size in SPDT model and the outbreak size in SPST model. The revised the text
in the 1st paragraph of Section 4.2 on p.8.
‘The amplification in outbreak size with the SPDT model is up to 5.6 times for sparse
networks and 4.3 times for dense networks at rt=60 min (Fig.4B).’
Results:
Commnet-9 (Page 9, line 57-58): I wouldn’t consider Re for dense SPDT model to be strong
compared to dense SPST model, because the interquartile ranges of DST and DDT overlap
for all values of rt in Figure 4C. Is there perhaps another explanation for why outbreak sizes
are amplified up to 4.3 times in the dense networks?
Response: We agree with Reviewer 1 that outbreak sizes are not only amplified in SPDT
model due to Re. Number of higher degree individuals and stronger underlying connectivity
are the key factors to amplify the diffusion in SPDT model. The variation in initial Rt also
influences the amplification in SPDT model. It is explained in the 2nd paragraph of Section
4.2 of our manuscript on p.9.
‘the disease gradually reaches to the higher degree individuals’
‘In the SST network, $I_p$ could not grow for any value of $r_t$ due to very small initial
$R_t$ and lack of connectivity for considering only direct links’
Discussion:
Comment-10: It’s strange to see new results (Figures 8 and 9) being introduced in the
discussion section. Please move these to the results section.
Response: Agreed, we have moved it to the results section.
Response to the minor comments of Reviewer 1:
Comment-1 ( Page 5, Line 7) : “Contrasting disease”. Shouldn’t it be “contracting a
disease”?
Response: We have replaced ‘Contrasting disease’ with ‘Contracting a disease’.
Comment-2 ( Page 6, line 33-34): It is mentioned here that sparse SPST and SPDT
networks will be denoted as SST and SDT, yet the acronym usage is reverted back to SPST
and SPDT in the same paragraph and rest of the paper. Please be consistent in the usage of
acronyms. If there is a difference between SPST(SPDT) and SST(SPST), please clearly
state the distinction.
Response: We would like to thank Reviewer 1 for suggesting clarifying networks definition.
SST, SDT, DST, DDT, LST and LDT networks are the different types of SPST and SPDT
networks. In this paper, SPST network means network with direct links while SPDT networks
mean network with both direct and indirect links. The SPST and SPDT networks are
conceptual network definition. We have included an explanation in the 2nd paragraph of
Section – 3.2 on p.5 of the manuscript.
“In this paper, Sparse SPDT network is denoted as SDT network and Sparse SPST network
as SST network. However, SPDT network mean any network with both direct and indirect links
while SPST network mean network with direct links only.”
Comment-3 (Page 7, line 45-46): “continuous reduction dies out the disease”. It is unclear
what this means. Please rephrase.
Response: We have revised the text “continuous reduction dies out the disease” as “disease
dies out if it continuously reduces” in Section 3.5 on p.6 of our manuscript.
Comment-4 ( Page 8, line 39): the interaction <U+F0E0> an interaction
Response: We have updated our manuscript according to advice.
Comment-5 (Page 8, line 46): remove period after rt
Response: We have removed it.
Comment-6 (Page 8, line 47): It is unclear what “the same changes” mean with regards to
the previous statement.
Response: Thanks to Reviewer 1 for noticing this. We have found that this is a redundant
line added by mistaken. We have removed it.
Comment-7: Figure 3 legend: spst and spdt should be in upper case. Also, these are
referred to as SST and SDT networks in the text. Please be consistent with the acronym
usage.
Response: We have updated the legend and replaced the SST and SDT with SPST and
SPDT. We want to discus SPST and SPDT model in general. Thus, SST and SDT is
removed.
Comment-8: Figure 3C and D: What does the solid red line labeled as spdt represent?
Where is it in the figure?
Response: We have added text in the caption what is meant by these. The included text in
the caption of Figure 3 of our manuscript of p.8 is as follows:
`SPST (dashed line) and SPDT (solid lines) networks properties: A) degree distribution in
static networks, B) clustering co-efficient distribution in static networks, C) daily average
degree in dynamic networks, and D) daily average clustering co-efficient in dynamic
networks’
Comment-9: Figure 2 and 3: It will be easier to follow these figures if the same coloring
scheme for rt values is followed for all figures.
Response: We have updated the colours for the lines to be consistent in Figures 2 and 3.
Comment-10: Figure 4: Please change the y-axis label of 4A to “outbreak size” so that it is
consistent with the rest of the figures. “Total number of infections” can be mentioned in
brackets as a definition.
Response: We have changed the Y-axis label of Figure 4A to “outbreak size”.
Reviewer 2:
Below are minor comments.
Abstract:
I much preferred the previous abstract. It was easier to read and had a nice flow to it. This
abstract needs cleaning up. i.e.
“Most of the current diffusion models only consider direct interactions among individuals to
build underlying infectious items transmission networks.”
1) I think it was fine to refer to these other models as “network models”.
2) “to build underlying infectious items transmission networks” is not clear. I think what you
are trying to say (which I agree with) is that ‘Most network models only consider direct
contacts capable of transmitting disease’
P 2. L41-52. There are a lot of abbreviations introduced, but not defined. I feel like much of
this should be in the methods section.
P 3 Line 16, Fig1 : define ‘L’ in the text (as the blue circle) and in the figure. Or leave it out
completely.
P 3. 57. Change ‘directed transmission’ to ‘direct transmission’
P 4. L7 “we integrate…” This sentence needs clarifying.
P4. 7-14. You use ‘proximity’ and ‘location L’ to represent the same think. Just use one.
P4. L42. change ‘an SPDT links’ to ‘SPDT links’. Make this change elsewhere as well (ie pg
5 L20, ‘an SPDT to a SPDT’).
P4. (2.8) Does ‘E’, overall exposure, include both direct and indirect links? As it is written, it
looks like it only includes indirect links. Please clarify. Should E not include both E_d and
E_l?
P4. L59. This is the first time you have mentioned virus. Until this point you have kept the
infectious agent general. I would suggest continuing to do so, or state that you are modelling
viral dynamics earlier.
P5 L24-26. “When the host user’s last…” This is an important sentence and needs cleaning
up/ clarification.
P5 L 26-17. Perhaps change “of last update” to “for up to 200 min since the last update” (?)
P5. L 49-50. ‘diffusion behaviours of SPDT model comparing to SPST model’. change to: ‘of
the SPDT model’ or ‘of SPDT models”… etc.
P6. Under Characterizing Metrics. The first sentence needs clarifying. I would not refer
to I_n and I_p as parameters. Also, what is the symbol for individuals recovered? Is this I_r
(which you use below?). Do the subscripts ‘n’ and ‘p’ implicitly represent time (simulation
day)? Also can you elaborate on how you take the average of Rt to get Re.
P7. L11. Is ‘r_t’ the same as ‘r’ defined above. Is the ‘t’ subscript indicative of decay time? I
think you may have confused decay rate with the lifespan of a particle. I would think that as
particles decay more quickly (ie the largest rate r_t=60), you would have fewer particles
lingering about, since they are decaying quickly. I am assuming that r_t is the lifespan, and r
is the rate. Make this clean and relabel the figure.
P9 L10-12. “…reaches to the individuals,…”
change to “reaches the higher degree individuals”
P9 L55 subscript on R missing.
P11 consider using different symbol for recovery and infectivity. You use \sigma for both.
(see top of P11 and (3.1). This becomes more confusing later on in your discussion on P14.
Our response to Reviewer 2
Abstract:
Comment-1: I much preferred the previous abstract. It was easier to read and had a nice
flow to it. This abstract needs cleaning up. i.e.
“Most of the current diffusion models only consider direct interactions among individuals to
build underlying infectious items transmission networks.”
i) I think it was fine to refer to these other models as “network models”.
ii) “to build underlying infectious items transmission networks” is not clear. I think what you
are trying to say (which I agree with) is that ‘Most network models only consider direct
contacts capable of transmitting disease’
Response: We would like to thank Reviewer 2 for addressing these important issues. We
have updated the abstract according to the suggestions. The revised Abstract of our
manuscript as follow:
‘Interaction patterns at the individual level influence the behaviour of diffusion over contact
networks. Most of the current diffusion models only consider direct interactions, capable of
transferring infectious items among individuals, to build transmission networks of diffusion.
However, delayed indirect interactions, where a susceptible individual interacts with infectious
items after the infected individual has left the interaction space, can also cause transmission
events. We define a diffusion model called the same place different time transmission (SPDT)
based diffusion that considers transmission links for these indirect interactions. Our SPDT
model changes the network dynamics where the connectivity among individuals varies with
the decay rates of link infectivity. We investigate SPDT diffusion behaviours by simulating
airborne disease spreading on data-driven contact networks. The SPDT model significantly
increases diffusion dynamics with a high rate of disease transmission. By making the
underlying connectivity denser and stronger due to the inclusion of indirect transmissions,
SPDT models are more realistic than SPST models for the study of various airborne diseases
outbreaks. Importantly, we also find that the diffusion dynamics including indirect links are not
reproducible by the current SPST models, even if both SPDT and SPST networks assume the
same underlying connectivity. This is because the transmission dynamics of indirect links are
different to those of direct links. The outcomes of this paper highlight the importance of the
indirect links for predicting outbreaks.’
Comment-2 ( P 2. L41-52): There are a lot of abbreviations introduced, but not defined. I feel
like much of this should be in the methods section.
Response: Thanks to Reviewer 2 for suggesting to clarify the abbreviations of contact
networks names used in our experiment. We have revised the text of Section 3.2 on p.5 to
make clearer the definition of constructed networks. We have included some of them here.
‘The above constructed networks show low link densities as users often appear in the system
for an average of 3-4 days and then disappear for the remainder of the data collection period.
This is characterised by the limitations of the collection system and user's behaviours when
using the social networking App. Thus, these networks are called Sparse SPDT network and
Sparse SPST network which capture partial snapshots of real-world social contact networks.
In this paper, Sparse SPDT network is denoted as SDT network and Sparse SPST network
as SST network.’
We reconstruct a Dense SPDT network (DDT network) repeating links from available days of
a user to the missing days for that user [2, 3]. In this process, all links of a day picked randomly
from available days are copied to a random missing day. Thus, the DDT network has links for
every day for each user. Then, the corresponding Dense SPST network (DST network) is built
excluding indirect links from the DDT network.’
We create two networks, LDT and LST, which maintain the same link densities and the same
underlying social structure as that of the DDT network.’
Comment-3 (P 3 Line 16): Fig1 : define ‘L’ in the text (as the blue circle) and in the figure. Or
leave it out completely.
Response: We have updated Figure 1 and the corresponding text as follows in Section 2 on
p.3.
‘In this particular scenario, an infected individual A (host individual), red circle, arrives at
location L, blue dashed circle’
Comment-4 (P 3. 57): Change ‘directed transmission’ to ‘direct transmission’
Response: We have replaced ‘directed transmission’ with ‘direct transmission’
Comment-5 (P 4. L7 ): “we integrate…” This sentence needs clarifying.
Response: We have revised the text in the 3rd paragraph of Section 2 on p.3 of our
manuscript.
We combine a method with the SPDT model to assess the probability of contracting disease
through an SPDT link (also called SPDT link infectivity) using generic assumptions’
Comment-6 (P4. 7-14): You use ‘proximity’ and ‘location L’ to represent the same think. Just
use one.
Response: We have updated the relevant text in 4th paragraph of Section 2 on p.4 of our
manuscript. The revised text is as follows:
‘Suppose that an infected individual A appears at a location L at time ts and deposits
airborne infectious particles into the air of L with a rate g (particles/s)’
Comment-7 (P4. L42): change ‘an SPDT links’ to ‘SPDT links’. Make this change
elsewhere as well (ie pg 5 L20, ‘an SPDT to a SPDT’).
Response: We have revised the text accordingly
Comment-8 (P4, 2.8): Does ‘E’, overall exposure, include both direct and indirect links? As it
is written, it looks like it only includes indirect links. Please clarify. Should E not include both
E_d and E_l?
Response: We would like to thank Reviewer 2 for seeking clarification for this import point. E
is the summation of El while it is consisted of Ed and Ei . Therefore, E is consisted of both direct
and indirect exposure. We have added some extra explanation to clarify it in 4th paragraph of
Section 2 on p.4 of our manuscript. The revised text is as follows:
‘where Elk is the received exposure for kth SPDT link which have direct and/or indirect
components’
Comment-9 (P4. L59): This is the first time you have mentioned virus. Until this point you
have kept the infectious agent general. I would suggest continuing to do so, or state that you
are modelling viral dynamics earlier.
Response: We have revised the text according to the suggestion. The last line of Section 2
on p.4 as follows:
‘This value depends on both the disease type and the infectiousness of particles’
Comment-10 (P5 L24-26): “When the host user’s last…” This is an important sentence and
needs cleaning up/ clarification.
Response: We have rewritten the corresponding text in 1st paragraph of Section 3.2 on p.5
as follows:
When the last update of the host user's is made from more than 20 metres distance of his
first update of the current location or after 30 minutes of his immediate previous update, a
new link creation process is started at the new location.’
Comment-11 (P5 L 26-17): Perhaps change “of last update” to “for up to 200 min since the
last update” (?)
Response: We have agreed with the Reviewer 2 and updated the relevant text in our
manuscript as follows in 1st paragraph of Section 3.2 on p.5:
‘However, the link creation is continued at the previous location for up to 200 minutes since
the last update of the host user’
Comment-12 (P5. L 49-50): ‘diffusion behaviours of SPDT model comparing to SPST
model’. change to: ‘of the SPDT model’ or ‘of SPDT models”… etc.
Response: We have made the suggested change in our manuscript.
Comment-13 P6: Under Characterizing Metrics. The first sentence needs clarifying. I would
not refer to I_n and I_p as parameters. Also, what is the symbol for individuals recovered?
Is this I_r (which you use below?). Do the subscripts ‘n’ and ‘p’ implicitly represent time
(simulation day)? Also can you elaborate on how you take the average of Rt to get Re.
Response: We would like to thank Reviewer 2 for noticing these important points regarding
the characterising metrics in our manuscript. The subscripts ‘n’ and ‘p’ presents new infection
and prevalence infection in the system. We have explained the calculation of Re from Rt. We
have revised the text reflecting this in Section 3.5 on p.6.
We have collected the following values of disease incidents at each day of simulation to
characterize diffusion dynamics in the networks: number of infections In(t) caused at a
simulation day t, number of infected individuals Ir(t) recovered from infection and current
number of infected individuals Ip(t) (disease prevalence) in the system on a simulation day t.’
‘Then, we find the average Re of Rt summing Rt and dividing by the number of simulation
days. The value of Re represents the overall strength of a disease to diffuse on the contact
networks.’
Comment-14 (P7. L11): Is ‘r_t’ the same as ‘r’ defined above. Is the ‘t’ subscript indicative of
decay time? I think you may have confused decay rate with the lifespan of a particle. I would
think that as particles decay more quickly (ie the largest rate r_t=60), you would have fewer
particles lingering about, since they are decaying quickly. I am assuming that r_t is the
lifespan, and r is the rate. Make this clean and relabel the figure.
Response: We have revised the text to reflect the suggestion of Reviewer 2. In our
experiment, rt is the time corresponding to a r. In fact, through the value of rt we represents r
as rt is more convenient to read while r is very small fractional value and reduces readability.
We have defined the rt in the caption of Figure 2 on p.7 of our manuscript. So that reader can
understand how rt relates r.
‘Particles concentrations for various particles decay rates rt, where rt =1/60r min and r is the
proportion of particles is decayed per second, at a visited location when A) an infected
individual is present at the location over 200 min and B) the infected individual has left the
location after staying 200 min’
P9 L10-12. “…reaches to the individuals,…”
change to “reaches the higher degree individuals”
Response: We have replaced the text according to the suggestion of Reviewer 2.
P9 L55 subscript on R missing.
Response: We have fixed it.
P11 consider using different symbol for recovery and infectivity. You use \sigma for both.
(see top of P11 and (3.1). This becomes more confusing later on in your discussion on P14.
Response: We have fixed it. We have used \tau for recovery rate and \sigma for infectivity.
