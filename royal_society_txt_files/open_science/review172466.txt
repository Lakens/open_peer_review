The manuscript reported the interesting and potentially useful synergistic antibacterial activity of
the compounds along with penicillin G to kill the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The compounds were isolated from a deep sea fungus strain cultured in lab and were
characterized by NMR and MS for structures. The synergistic antibacterial activity with penicillin
G was investigated carefully with controls. I suggest a minor revision of the manuscript before
consideration of publication with the following comments:
(1) It looks that the last paragraph of the introduction section is not well connected with the
paragraphs above. The authors may consider providing more descriptions to justify why using
deep see organisms can give better chance to achieve the antibotic aims than other possible
choices of organisms.
(2) The synergistic antibacterial activity is very interesting. It seems that the authors only tried
one combination of concentrations for each compound. I think there may be an optimized
concentration ratio for the synergistic antibacterial activity. This ratio could be useful to indicate
some clue mechanism of action. I recommend an additional test to find the optimized
concentration ratio for compound 4 and penicillin G.
(3) It's interesting to me that compound 3 does not have activity compared with compound 4,
while the two compounds are only different in one chira carbon. Is there any explanation for this
pehnomenon? Or is any literature reference studying such a similar structure-activity
relationship?

Point-By-Point responses to reviewer comments
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript requires corrections:
<b>Introduction</b>
• page 2, line 5 is: …osmoticlysis…, should be: …osmotic lysis…
Response: The mistake has been revised in the new version (Page2, Line2).
• Authors should explain, why <i>Penicillium biourgeianum</i> DFFSCS023 was chosen for
this research?
Response: The reason for choosing fungus Penicillium biourgeianum DFFSCS023 was
described in the information section: …Our long-term search on new anti-bacterial agents from
deep-sea fungi found that the extract of Penicillium biourgeianum DFFSCS023 exhibited good
antibacterial activity against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). ..
• In this section, authors should describe the purpose of their research.
Response: The purpose of the research has been revised and added in the new context (Page2,
Line 19-32).
<b><b><b>Materials and methods</b></b></b>
• page 3, line 50 is: …. Methicillin-sensitive…, should be: … methicillin-sensitive…
Response: The mistake has been corrected in the new manuscript (Page4, Line4).
<b>Subsection 2.5</b>
• Is written: The in vitro antimicrobial activities of the compound 4, 5 and 6 against MSSA and
MRSA were respectively determined…. – here is inaccuracy, because Figure 3A shows that
compounds 8 and 9 were also used in MSSA. Why antibacterial activities of compounds 8 and 9
were not specified for MRSA?
Response: Because this study focused to report the biological activity of penicillenols A1, A2,
B1, and B2. (Compounds 8 and 9 do not belong to penicillenols family, and didn’t exhibit
anti-MRSA.)
• Authors should explain, why the concentration of 40 µg/mL of each compound was used in
time-kill curve assay?
Response: Compound 4, 5, 6 were nominated as penicillenol A2, penicillenol B1 and
penicillenol B2, respectively; and their molecular weight are similar to each other. We referred to
previous studies about penicillin antibacterial study, the concentration between 20 µg/mL and 100
µg/mL were widely used. As a result, the antibiotics’ concentration in the range (20-100 µg/mL)
was used.
<b>Subsection 2.6</b>
• Is written: ….diluted MRSA cultures were respectively supplied with 80 µg/mL of compound
4 alone…. – here is inaccuracy, because Figures 4 and 5 show that compounds 5 and 6 were also
used.
Response: The mistake has been corrected as …The synergetic antibacterial effect of
compounds 5 and 6 were determined as 4… in the revised manuscript (Page4, Line27-28).
• Authors should explain, why the concentration of 80 µg/mL of compound was used?
Response: This study used three different concentrations: 40, 60 and 80 µg/mL (in the range
of 20-100 µg/mL that commonly used in antibacterial test); and then we discovered that 80 µg/mL
of compound exhibited stronger synergetic antibacterial effect than other concentrations. As a
result, this concentration was highlighted.
• Authors should explain, which method was used to determine the synergistic antibacterial
effect, time-kill curve assay or Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion method or both methods?
Response: Plate counts and Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion methods were used to determine the
synergistic antibacterial effect, which has been described in the last paragraph of page 9 (from
Page9, Line16 to Page10, Line2).
<b>Results and discussion</b>
• Figure 1 is not listed in the manuscript text.
Response: Figure 1 has been listed in the new content.
• is: …. Fig.2…, should be: … Figure 2…
Response: Thanks. “…Fig. 2…” has been corrected as “…Figure 2…” in the new version.
• page 8, line 10 is:
Response: Thanks. “…. on methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)…”, has been
corrected as “… on MSSA…”.
• page 8, line 23 is written: …containing 40 µg of the compounds… - in subsection 2.7 is
written that the concentration of 40 µg or 80 µg was used. Both concentration were used? Explain
it, please.
Response: Actually, we have used the both concentrations in the experiment of Figure S1. Due to
the generated outcomes (40 µg and 80 µg) of Figure S1 were same, we only used one of the results
(40 µg) to present.
• page 8, lines 26-30 – why the results for MRSA are not described?
Response: We all know that MRSA is more difficult to deal with than MSSA. Figure S1 that
all the zone diameters were too small against MSSA, so we think it is not necessary to described
the MRSA.
• page 8, lines 47-48 is written: …This could be caused by MRSA produced lactamases, which
destroyed the lactam ring of compounds…- is it true that these compounds contain a lactim ring?
Response: The chemical structure of compound 4 (as shown below) fragment in blue color is
a <U+03B3>-lactam ring.
• page 10, lines 34-34 – why only the synergistic effect between compound 4 and antibiotics
was described? Why the results for the other components (5, 6) have not been described?
Response: The production of penicillenols in the fermentation process of the Penicillium
biourgeianum DFFSCS023 was very low. To save cost, we chose to only use compound 4 for
synergistic test.
• Discussion is very poor - Authors did not refer to the results of other researchers.
Response: There is very few study about the antibacterial activity of penicillenols, and there is
no published study about the synergistic effect between penicillenol and antibiotics. We have
re-written the discussion section and compared with certain related studies (marked yellow) (from
Page10, Lines21 to Page11, Lines4).

• Is written : …et al…. - enter the names of authors
Response: All names of authors have been clearly presented in References in the revised
manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript reported the interesting and potentially useful synergistic antibacterial activity of
the compounds along with penicillin G to kill the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The
compounds were isolated from a deep sea fungus strain cultured in lab and were characterized by
NMR and MS for structures. The synergistic antibacterial activity with penicillin G was
investigated carefully with controls. I suggest a minor revision of the manuscript before
consideration of publication with the following comments:
(1) It looks that the last paragraph of the introduction section is not well connected with the
paragraphs above. The authors may consider providing more descriptions to justify why using
deep sea organisms can give better chance to achieve the antibiotic aims than other possible
choices of organisms.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The last paragraph of the introduction section was
revised (Page2, Lines19-32).
“We found the extract of Penicillium biourgeianum DFFSCS023 exhibited antibacterial effect
against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) through our long-term search for
new anti-bacterial agents from deep-sea fungi. The continental world is running out of antibiotics
because bacteria become resistant in a short time. This could be the antibiotics we used were
derived from continental species. We speculated that the deep-sea derived antibiotics could reduce
bacterial resistance and also have effective antibacterial outcome, which will help us a lot for
microbicides development. Photochemistry research of P. biourgeianum DFFSCS023 extract
concluded that this deep-sea fungus produced 14 compounds (1-14) including one novel unknown
compound (1). Compound 4 exhibited potential antibacterial activity against MSSA in this study).
The combination with beta-lactam antibiotics could significantly reduce MRSA survival. Herein
we report the isolation, elucidation and anti-bacterial activity of those compounds”
(2) The synergistic antibacterial activity is very interesting. It seems that the authors only tried one
combination of concentrations for each compound. I think there may be an optimized
concentration ratio for the synergistic antibacterial activity. This ratio could be useful to indicate
some clue mechanism of action. I recommend an additional test to find the optimized
concentration ratio for compound 4 and penicillin G.
Response: The penicillenol compounds are difficult to be isolated, and they are low-yield. The
isolation and identification of penicillenol compounds have taken a lot works. Based on a
consideration of saving budget, we only chose fixed concentrations of these compounds to carry
out the biological experiments according to the preliminary report of MIC (minimum inhibitory
concentration) measurements. This project has been finished almost one year, we have no
resources at present to continue the test for optimizing concentration ratio. However, your
suggestion is very valuable, we will discuss for future study.
(3) It's interesting to me that compound 3 does not have activity compared with compound 4,
while the two compounds are only different in one chira carbon. Is there any explanation for this
phenomenon? Or is any literature reference studying such a similar structure-activity relationship?
Response: Wang J. et al. (2017) generated the similar result that penicillenols A1(3) and A2(4)
(isolated from another deep-sea fungus Aspergillus restrictus), exhibited different anti-bacterial
activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 strain with MIC values of 100 and 12.5
µg/mL, respectively. The different configurations of two compounds could have an effect on the
connection with binding receptor.
