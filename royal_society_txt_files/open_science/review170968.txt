Review of avoidance of biological contaminants... in chimpanzees
Val Curtis, LSHTM
This is an excellent paper, sharp, to the point, clearly written and a major contribution to the field
of disease avoidance behaviour in Animalia. I particularly welcome the authors’ making
connections between the human and other primate literature, and their use of the word ‘disgust’
for this adaptive system that orchestrates a behavioural response to potential infection threats.
I have only minor issues:
1/The English needs a small amount of work. In particular, there should be far more commas to
aid readability. The para after line 187 could be streamlined, as it is hard to follow.
2/I would like a brief examination of whether there could have been any effects of learning as
different/same chimps carried out different/same experiments.
3/It might be more consistent to use error bars in fig 3.

Overall, this is a well-designed project, examining an important new area in animal behavior in a
manner that interdigitates well with an extensive literature on humans. I recommend that the
paper be accepted following minor revision.
The authors sought to examine whether cues of potentially pathogen-bearing conspecific body
products would lead to behavioral avoidance of foodstuffs located in proximity to the cue.
Visual, olfactory, and tactile cues were experimentally manipulated independent of each other.
Of these, the clearest indications of behavioral avoidance were elicited by the tactile cues. More
subtle patterns of avoidance were discernable, depending on the dependent measures used, in
the visual and olfactory conditions. The methods employed appear sound, the analyses appear
appropriate for the data (although this is not my area of expertise), and the writing is clear and
logical. My suggestions below concern some modifications that would make the paper more
transparent, and would highlight some possibilities that are overlooked at present.
In the main text, the authors are quite forthright in stating when their predictions were not
supported, and similarly do a good job of pointing out trends while still underscoring analytic
significance. The abstract, however, is less transparent, as it gives the impression of unequivocal
patterns in the results. In fact, while the tactile experiment produced very clear, unambiguous
results supporting the predicted pattern of behavioral avoidance (of tactile cues of the presence of
feces), the other two experiments produced much more mixed results, with no significant
differences between experimental and control conditions along the principal axes of comparison,
the differences only appearing with regard to secondary avenues for assessing behavior. I
therefore think that, in the abstract, the sentence “Our results show increased latencies to feed…”
should be prefaced by a qualifying caveat, perhaps as follows: “Although results in two of three
experiments were mixed, overall, our results show…”
At present, the authors’ discussion of the various factors that may have influenced outcome
behaviors is relatively brief. I have a number of thoughts on this. First, by virtue of their captive
status, were the experimental animals routinely exposed to conspecific feces to a greater extent
than would be true in the wild? Presumably, in the wild, greater mobility, and frequent changes
of feeding and nesting sites, are such as to entail lower exposure than would be true even in a
well-maintained captive facility. If so, then the experimental animals may be more habituated to
feeding in proximity to feces than would be true in the wild. Presumably this would be less true
of blood than of feces, as keepers likely adjust the composition of the captive groups so as to
reduce agonistic conflict relative to that which would occur in the wild. I cannot judge the
likelihood of differences between wild and captive settings with regard to exposure to semen, but
perhaps the authors have relevant information in this regard.
Second, the tactile experiment is interesting, and directly parallels a prior study of humans. A
priori, we might expect chimpanzees to be at least as sensitive, if not more, to visual and olfactory
cues of contaminants than to tactile cues, since the former afford true avoidance, whereas the
experience of the latter indicates that contact has already occurred. That the results are least
ambiguous in the tactile experiment therefore makes it incumbent upon the authors to discuss
4
various possible explanations. (Here I suggest one such possibility, but the authors should not
rely on this alone.) Perhaps the tactile result simply reflects neophobia, or even merely surprise.
The authors note that the dough “was kept in an icebox until experimentation”. The chimps may
rarely encounter cold things, and might be particularly surprised to discover something cold
inside a box (as opposed, say, to a cold treat with which they are familiar, cold water, etc.). In
short, what can the authors tell us about the quotidian experiences of the experimental animals
that might bear on the results of the tactile experiment?

rofessor Kevin Padian and Ms Alice Power,
ank you and the reviewers for the constructive comments on our earlier submission of the
cript, “Avoidance of biological contaminants through sight, smell and touch in chimpanzees” for
eration in Royal Society Open Science.
onse to the reviewers’ comments, we have made a few changes to the revised version of the
cript. To briefly summarise the changes we have made, in response to Reviewer 1’s comments,
nducted new analyses to test for potential effects of learning in our contaminant avoidance
ments (- and did not observe any), and we have now included a few sentences of reflection on the
tions of our work and perspectives for future research. In response to Reviewer 2’s comments, we
pdated our abstract, to be more transparent, and discussed the potential effect of surprise on
avoidance in our tactile experiments.
sponses to the reviewers’ comments are inserted after each comment below in blue text.
