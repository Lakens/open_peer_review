This paper studies the effect of non-constant diffusion rate in pattern formation in spatial
ecological public goods games. The topic and their results are very interesting, but I have some
major concerns.
Major 1
For bacterial diffusion model, the authors assume that cooperator diffusion rate is constant and
that defector diffusion rate increases as f (fraction of cooperator) and rho (total density) approach
1/2. They provide some explanations why this mimics bacterial diffusion, which I could not
understand at all.
Generally speaking, there are many species of bacteria and calling it bacterial diffusion model
might be too much. Different bacteria species produce different patterns.
Major 2
Cooperator diffusion rate is set constant throughout the paper. This is probably much stronger
assumption than the authors supposed. If cooperators in different postions have different
diffusion rates, we cannot rescale them as unity without loss of generality. So the family of
systems studied in this paper contains very special cases only.
Since the system is very complicated, I do not insist to redo the whole analysis. However, some
sentences, particularly in Section 4, are claiming far more than the present analysis can suggest.
Texts should be modified or weakened accordingly.
Major 3
Figure 2 must be comparable with Figure 1. I have once worked with this system,
so I know that numerical treatment of this system is quite sensitive.
Patterns could be different in Crank-Nicholson and Euler methods.
Thus, the comparison with the baseline case is important. See my comments below.

Coexistence in r=2.32 with constant diffusion rate is quite unlikely.

Summary:
The authors present an interesting and relevant extension to the dynamics of spatial ecological
public goods games. Their work is a direct extension of earlier work by Wakano et al PNAS
(2009) to non-constant diffusion. In a very thorough manner the authors investigate the pattern
formation process for a number of functional forms for the dependence of diffusion on
population density or frequency of cooperators. Particular emphasis is placed on two biologically
motivated scenarios relating to bacterial and human migration, which result in distinctly different
spatial patterns. Overall the study makes an interesting contribution with a number of smaller
points that would help to improve the accessibility of the manuscript.
Minor points:
- p3,l56: the carrying capacity is not 1! Instead, 1 is the maximum density, which represents a
hard non-sustainable upper limit.
- p4,l12: explain/motivate lower bound of 2 for S. The 'group' size can be S=1.
- p4,l21: identifying w as 'space' is misleading given that explicit spatial dimensions are
introduced shortly afterwards. Maybe use 'reproductive opportunities'?
4
- p4,l46f: it might be worth pointing out that the PDE is actually a continuum limit of a meta-
population with sub-populations arranged in a lattice and connected by migration (diffusion) but
not through interactions.
- p6,l6-49: the analysis of different functional forms of the diffusion is interesting but a bit
exhaustive. Maybe relegate to an appendix?
- p6,l57: it would be helpful if the approximation was briefly explained.
- eq.2.7/8: the N[...] is not really needed and can be easily evaluated to make the equations more
easily accessible.
- p7,l8: what is the evidence for humans to avoid high densities, i.e. high mobility? The process of
urbanization is clearly happening but this suggests a complementary 'ruralization'.
- p8,l8f: see note above (p6,l6-49)
- p8,l19: explain meaning of 'surface area' as there is no boundary between cooperator and
defector domains.
- p8,l21: The sentence 'The striped patterns due to (1-f) boost up cooperation from low fractions.'
is hard to understand because diffusion of cooperators is constant and the origin of the 1-f term
remains unclear.
- fig4: much more illustrative than fig3 because it demonstrates the robustness of patterns.
- p8,l46f: what about the average population density? Is it indeed higher in stripped than in
dotted patterns as this suggests? This is a key question and fig.C2 points in that direction but
certainly deserves to be covered in the main text.
- p8: the first paragraph of the discussion is a bit repetitive.
- p10,l10f: this paragraph sketches interesting potential links but remains rather vague and
speculative. Less examples but more specific ties to the presented model and results would be
preferable.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper studies the e<U+FB00>ect of non-constant di<U+FB00>usion rate in pattern
formation in spatial ecological public goods games. The topic and their
results are very interesting, but I have some major concerns.
We thank the referee for the thorough review of our manuscript and
constructive comments. In our revision we have addressed all the below
concerns, we hope in a satisfactory manner.
Major 1
For bacterial di<U+FB00>usion model, the authors assume that cooperator di<U+FB00>usion
rate is constant and that defector di<U+FB00>usion rate increases as f (fraction of
cooperator) and rho (total density) approach 1/2. They provide some
explanations why this mimics bacterial di<U+FB00>usion, which I could not
understand at all.
Generally speaking, there are many species of bacteria and calling it
bacterial di<U+FB00>usion model might be too much. Di<U+FB00>erent bacteria species
produce di<U+FB00>erent patterns.
- As we introduced in Eq. (2.5), the density dependent function g(f,
\rho) can take any form. Since there are many possibilities for formulating
the function, we intend to formulate two di<U+FB00>erent density dependencies that
may be observed in reality as concrete examples for showing di<U+FB00>erent
pattern formations. We do not intend to insist that our formulation for
bacterial di<U+FB00>usion explain general bacterial di<U+FB00>usion. We have formulated
the current model according to one particular experimental paper and the
di<U+FB00>usion function derived from therein.
As per your comment, we toned down our general claim and explicitly
mention that the bacterial di<U+FB00>usion is one possible example inspired by the
conventional bacterial growth model and related experiments below Eq.
(2.5): “As possible concrete examples, we develop two relevant
formulations; one inspired by bacterial di<U+FB00>usion on a petri dish and the
second inspired by human migration studies” We now also add more
explanation for the new Eq. (2.6): "These mobility patterns can be described
by a subset of functions described in Fig 2 (a). For the di<U+FB00>usion sketched
from the bacterial movement, we look at the experiment results and its
modeling [36,47]. In the model, bacteria grow by consuming nutrients and
spread by di<U+FB00>using in space.
The results have shown that the bacteria grow faster when nutrients are in
abundance and slower when the bacterial density is too low.
From this experimental result, we interpret that bacterial productivity is ---
fast, when nutrients are abundant and slow, when bacterial concentrations
are too low. ”
Major 2
Cooperator di<U+FB00>usion rate is set constant throughout the paper. This is
probably much stronger assumption than the authors supposed. If
cooperators in di<U+FB00>erent postions have di<U+FB00>erent di<U+FB00>usion rates, we cannot
rescale them as unity without loss of generality. So the family of systems
studied in this paper contains very special cases only.
Since the system is very complicated, I do not insist to redo the whole
analysis. However, some sentences, particularly in Section 4, are claiming
far more than the present analysis can suggest. Texts should be modified or
weakened accordingly.
Taking your suggestion into account, we explicitly mention our strong
assumption and, accordingly, tone down our claims towards generality:
“While it is clear that pattern formation is possible due to the higher
di<U+FB00>usion coe<U+FB03>cient of the inhibitor, we have provided a biologically
meaningful reason for this di<U+FB00>usion disparity between activators and
inhibitors at a given assumption for the constant di<U+FB00>usion of cooperators.”,
“In this context, despite our strong assumption for the constant di<U+FB00>usion of
cooperators, our finding may support the reason why we frequently observe
dotted patterns in nature when the population gets stressed, either via
extrinsic causes such as the environment or the population composition
(e.g. increase in defectors) [63].”
Major 3
Figure 2 must be comparable with Figure 1. I have once worked with this
system,so I know that numerical treatment of this system is quite sensitive.
Patterns could be di<U+FB00>erent in Crank-Nicholson and Euler methods.
Thus, the comparison with the baseline case is important. See my
comments below.
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have reproduced the fig.
1 for showing the overall dynamics in the spatial public goods game, which
kind of patterns are obtained in each region. In the main text, on the other
hand, we have focused more on the comparison of two density dependent
di<U+FB00>usions and have excluded the constant di<U+FB00>usion coe<U+FB03>cient. However, as
you pointed out, it would be important to compare the density dependent
results with the constant di<U+FB00>usion results, as well. Accordingly, we added a
new panel in each figure to compare the results (we also used the forward
Euler method to get the results of the constant di<U+FB00>usion to prevent the
di<U+FB00>erence arise from using di<U+FB00>erent methods itself.). For the robustness of
results for using two di<U+FB00>erent algorithms, the Crank-Nicolson and the
forward Euler methods, we get the same trend in stationary patterns
agreeing with the work by Wakano et al PNAS (2009).
Other Comments:
All figures
It is better to mention which snapshot pattern is stationay and which one is
dynamic.
We added an explanation “chaos patterns are dynamic while others
are stationary patterns.” in the caption of Fig. 1.
Fig.2
I do not see why r=2.32 is used. This parameter is not shown in Fig 1
(baseline constant di<U+FB00>usion model), so readers cannot directly compare. It is
very important to check if the authors' implementation of non-constant
di<U+FB00>usion is working good or not.
We have used r=2.32 to clearly see the di<U+FB00>erent pattern formations for
di<U+FB00>erent density dependencies. For comparing the baseline constant
di<U+FB00>usion model, we added a new panel for the results from the constant
di<U+FB00>usion.
I also do not understand the orange box at right-bottom in Fig.2b. Is this
coexistence? Extinction?
Coexistence in r=2.32 with constant di<U+FB00>usion rate is quite unlikely.
We have not inserted the figure for the constant di<U+FB00>usion result in Fig.
2b to focus on comparisons between density dependent functions only.
Again, taking your suggestion into account, we also added a panel for the
constant di<U+FB00>usion, and it is coexistence. In Fig1., even for r=2.28 and D=10,
the striped pattern emerges, and the coexistence for r=2.32 and D=20
makes sense.
above (2.7) v w f = \rho (1-\rho) f (1-f) from (2.2) I do not understand this
part. From where do we get this equation?
Do you mean v w f = (defector productivity) ?
Approximately defector productivity can be written as vwf, and it can
be rewritten by <U+03C1>(1 - <U+03C1>)f (1 - f ) from the definition of f and \rho. We more
explicitly wrote the sentence: “Defectors mobility is thus a function of their
productivity, approximated as vwf equivalent to <U+03C1>(1 - <U+03C1>)f (1 - f ) from f = u
and <U+03C1> = u + v,…”. Also as per the second referee’s comment we now
explain the approximation itself.

"Slow movement in ...." -> "Slow movement OF DEFECTORS in ..."
Thank you. We have made the change.

Comments to the Author(s)
Summary:
The authors present an interesting and relevant extension to the dynamics
of spatial ecological public goods games. Their work is a direct extension of
earlier work by Wakano et al PNAS (2009) to non-constant di<U+FB00>usion. In a
very thorough manner the authors investigate the pattern formation process
for a number of functional forms for the dependence of di<U+FB00>usion on
population density or frequency of cooperators. Particular emphasis is
placed on two biologically motivated scenarios relating to bacterial and
human migration, which result in distinctly di<U+FB00>erent spatial patterns. Overall
the study makes an interesting contribution with a number of smaller points
that would help to improve the accessibility of the manuscript.
We thank the referee for providing a thorough review of our
manuscript and for constructive comments. The suggestions have helped
us improve the manuscript immensely.
Minor points:
p3,l56: the carrying capacity is not 1! Instead, 1 is the maximum density,
which represents a hard non-sustainable upper limit.
As you correctly pointed out, it is a maximum density. Accordingly, we
have changed the statement. Instead of "carrying capacity” we use
“maximum density”.
p4,l12: explain/motivate lower bound of 2 for S. The 'group' size can be
S=1.
We provide an explanation for the lower bound 2 above Eq (1): “The
lower bound 2 is natural because we need at least two individuals to
interact. If there is only one individual, there is no interaction, the game is
not played.”
p4,l21: identifying w as 'space' is misleading given that explicit spatial
dimensions are introduced shortly afterwards. Maybe use 'reproductive
opportunities’?
Thank you. Now we explicitly mention “reproductive opportunity”
instead of “space” to avoid misleading the readers.
p4,l46f: it might be worth pointing out that the PDE is actually a continuum
limit of a meta-population with sub-populations arranged in a lattice and
connected by migration (di<U+FB00>usion) but not through interactions.
We are grateful for pointing this out. Above Eq. (2.4), we restate and
add an explanation for this: “To include spatial dynamics, we envision
subpopulations spatially arranged on a two-dimensional lattice. In each
patch, the dynamics of the subpopulation is described by Eq (2.2), and
individuals, cooperators and defectors, randomly move between adjacent
patches. There is no game interaction between individuals who live in
di<U+FB00>erent patches. By taking the continuum limit of this spatially structured
subpopulations, we can get the changes of densities over time”
p6,l6-49: the analysis of di<U+FB00>erent functional forms of the di<U+FB00>usion is
interesting but a bit exhaustive. Maybe relegate to an appendix?
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we fully agree with you.
At the same time, we would like to take an approach from the general
formula to specific cases. As a compromise we have now massively
simplified the explanation for the general case and focus on the two
concrete examples.The motivation is captured below Eq. (2.5) as: “Since
two distinctly di<U+FB00>erent directions of pattern formation are observed by the
density dependent di<U+FB00>usions, we take a closer look at two representative
density dependent di<U+FB00>usion formulations instead of tracking all functional
forms. As concrete examples, we develop two relevant formulations which
can be inspired by real bacterial di<U+FB00>usion on a petri dish and human
migration”
p6,l57: it would be helpful if the approximation was briefly explained.
We carefully guess you meant the page 5. We added more explanation
for new Eq. (2.6): "These mobility patterns can be described by a subset of
functions described in Fig 2 (a). For the di<U+FB00>usion sketched from the
bacterial movement, we look at the experiment results and its modeling
[36,47]. In the model, bacteria grow by consuming nutrients and spread by
di<U+FB00>using in space.The results have shown that the bacteria grow faster
when nutrients are in abundance and slower when the bacterial density is
too low. From this experimental result, we interpret that bacterial
productivity is --- fast, when nutrients are abundant and slow, when
bacterial concentrations are too low.”
eq.2.7/8: the N[...] is not really needed and can be easily evaluated to make
the equations more easily accessible.
We directly wrote the equations without N[…] notation. Accordingly,
new Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7) have been edited.
p7,l8: what is the evidence for humans to avoid high densities, i.e. high
mobility? The process of urbanization is clearly happening but this suggests
a complementary ‘ruralization’.
Thanks a lot for pointing this fact out. The reference [37] has shown
that even humans prefer to stay longer in the moderate density, thus
strong spatial segregation—representing urbanization and ruralization at
the same time—can be induced when each individual pursues their own
utility. Thus indeed, our suggested density dependent di<U+FB00>usion, high
mobility in high density, can explain the human mobility including
ruralization. We now include a sentence towards this hypothesis.
p8,l8f: see note above (p6,l6-49)
We believe the comment refers to Fig. 2. As mentioned above, we
approach from the general scheme to specific cases. Hence, we would
like to keep the figure but simplify the statements and focus on two
di<U+FB00>erent density dependent di<U+FB00>usions.
p8,l19: explain meaning of 'surface area' as there is no boundary between
cooperator and defector domains.
Indeed. We meant the domain between subpopulations. So far, we
have cut down on this part to avoid exhaustive explanation for the general
di<U+FB00>usion formulations part.
p8,l21: The sentence 'The striped patterns due to (1-f) boost up cooperation
from low fractions.' is hard to understand because di<U+FB00>usion of cooperators
is constant and the origin of the 1-f term remains unclear.
If the populations have low f (fraction of cooperators), defectors move
faster when it contains (1-f) term in the formula of g(f, \rho). Since the
population with a faster movement of defectors is rescued forming the
pattern, we had made the above statement. As a part of reducing the
explanation on general di<U+FB00>usion functions, this statement has also been
removed.
fig4: much more illustrative than fig3 because it demonstrates the
robustness of patterns.
Thank you.
p8,l46f: what about the average population density? Is it indeed higher in
stripped than in dotted patterns as this suggests? This is a key question
and fig.C2 points in that direction but certainly deserves to be covered in
the main text.
We agree with your comment. We measure several quantities of
patterns to figure out the underlying mechanisms. While the dotted and
striped patterns do show distinct properties, the exact mechanisms
underlying their generation are hard to decipher. Thus, in the main text, we
emphasis the di<U+FB00>erent pattern formations under di<U+FB00>usion behaviour while
relegating the detailed analysis of patterns to the Appendix. As a
compromise we have mentioned it more clearly in the main text:
“Furthermore, we analyze the average quantities of patterns for each case,
see Appendix 4. Interestingly and counterintuitively, for $r<\rhopf$, we
observe the higher cooperator fraction in the striped patterns than the
dotted patterns.
p8: the first paragraph of the discussion is a bit repetitive.
Thank you. In rephrasing the discussion we have removed the
redundancy.
p10,l10f: this paragraph sketches interesting potential links but remains
rather vague and speculative. Less examples but more specific ties to the
presented model and results would be preferable.
We aim to make use of this paragraph to justify why we had chosen to
pursue the line of thought—the extension of di<U+FB00>usion dynamics. Firstly, we
highlight why it makes sense that defectors have a higher di<U+FB00>usion
coe<U+FB03>cient than cooperators. This needs to be highlighted as an essential
requirement for pattern formation; the inhibitors show higher di<U+FB00>usion than
the activators. Secondly, we highlight the reason why it is crucial to
consider density-dependent di<U+FB00>usion coe<U+FB03>cients. The way we wrote the
paragraph, it might have seemed more like a collection of examples.
Taking into account this comment, we now explicitly mention the reason
why we focus on the examples (sentences after reference [51]).
We hope the changes we have made to the manuscript are acceptable to
the reviewers and we thank them again for their e<U+FB00>orts in helping us
improve the manuscript.
