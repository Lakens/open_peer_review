Overview:
In the present manuscript the authors investigate in which US regions introduction of Bsal is
most likely. (Increased) surveillance of those high risk areas should be an absolute priority.
The emergence of Bsal is indeed a sobering event for salamander biodiversity and introduction
of Bsal in the United States would be a catastrophy. I commend the authors for attempting this
project. Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript.
I am not particularly acquainted with using computer models the asses disease risk. However,
when reading the manuscript, I felt that the manuscript has some shortcomings, even after the
authors have done a serious effort to meet the comments of the other referees.
Major remarks:
I have major concerns about several assumptions made (as mentionned by the authors is the
discussion): essential information on Bsal ecology, vectors, reservoirs, the prevalance of Bsal in
traded amphibians is lacking and makes it difficult to make a profound risk assesment.
Regarding the relative potential of a Bsal introduction event:
Currently, we have no idea what percentage of the imported salamanders (at customs)-
salamanders in pet shops is Bsal positive. We have no idea what percentage of hobby-kept
amphibians is Bsal positive. In particular hobby-kept amphibians are known to harbour
amphibian EIDs (Ranavirus, Bd, Bsal) and, unfortunately, in Europe trade at amphibian fairs is
unregulated. Is it regulated in the US? Screening of hobby-kept amphibians would be an
important fisrt step. It is unfortunate that possible spread of Bsal via fairs and among hobbyist
was not taken into account.
A joint study of the Dutch RAVON and Gent University, evaluating the possible pathways of
Bsal to and across the Netherlands, identified several prerequisites for the introduction of chytrid
fungi in a country and spread into the environment: i) presence of the pathogen in the land of
export, ii) survival of the pathogen during transport, iii) survival of the pathogen at the final
destination either on the amphibian host, water or soil and iv) release of the pathogen in the
immediate environment of wild amphibians, v) infection of free-living amphibians and vi)
establishment and maintainance of the pathogen in natural amphibian populations (Spitzen-van
der Sluijs et al., 2015). For spread of Bsal into the wild, e.g. via untreated waste water or release
of Bsal positive amphibians, conditions (not only temperature) must be optimal before Bsal can
establish and maintain within wild salamander populations.

Line 147: ‘Greater species richness may increase the number of available hosts or add reservoir
species, both of which may amplify disease transmision. Species richness may be an important
predictor of the consequences of Bsal introductions’.
It is true that the complexity of the amphibian community may affect disease risk. However, it is
known that increased species richness, of both hosts and non-hosts, will reduce the impact of at
least, Bd (and probably also Bsal) (infection prevalence and intensity), by affecting host-pathogen
contact rates and transmission (see for example Venesky et al., 2014). This is known as the
‘dilution effect’: increased species richness may work as a buffer against rapid transmission of
EIDs.
Line 177-179: Identification of risk areas for the introduction of Bsal is an important step to
prevent or limit worse. However, the Bsal outbreaks in the Netherlands and Belgium occured in
areas far away from major airports and large cities with numerous pet stores…

Review of Richgels et al. submission to Royal Society Open Science.
First, although it was not specified in my invitation to review, I presume that I am seeing a
revision that has been made in response to the reviews included in the pdf I downloaded. I have
worked to both assess the paper on its merits and to assess the extent to which the authors have
responded to the reviews presented.
This paper presents a risk model for the newly emerged amphibian disease Bsal in the US. There
is a lot of concern about this disease reaching the US, and new federal regulations on the trade in
salamanders are rumored to be in the works.
4
Many of the criticisms made by the earlier reviewers focus on the data used to parameterize the
models developed in this manuscript. I agree with the reviewers that data used are coarse and
based on several assumptions. Thus, the use of additional or finer scale data would inevitably
change the results. It’s important to note, however, that the data required to build better models
don’t exist. This is a new disease and one that we know very little about.
The question, then, is whether there is a compelling case to use imperfect data to make broad
predictions. I believe that there is. The concern expressed about this species’ potential to invade
the US, and the potential consequences if it does, are enormous. While more data would be very
useful, it is also appropriate to take the data that are presently available and build a set of ‘best
possible’ predictions of the likelihood and consequences of invasion. The predictions presented
here are in a form that is needed by policy makers, and I believe that the manuscript does a
reasonable job of specifying the caveats. Thus, this manuscript helps to describe the risks of this
species based on what we currently know. It will undoubtedly be updated as more is learned, but
this is a developing issue for which policy is currently needed.
I believe that the concerns of the reviewers have been adequately addressed. Many address the
data used, which I have commented on above. Others address the novelty of this work. While it is
not the first attempt to model the potential spread of Bsal in the US, it is novel for its different
approach, and I believe that the immediacy of the Bsal threat, and the interest that has been
shown in it by regulators, justifies additional work. I don’t think that the citation rate of this
paper will suffer from the previous work having been published.
I have two main concerns, each of which can be readily addressed.
First, I think the manuscript needs a better description of how the authors assume trade vector
could lead to an invasion. The authors don’t specifically describe how proximity to a place of
import affects risk of Bsal release. The assumption (I believe) is that the importer will be located
close to the port, and that the arrival of the organism at the port, transport to the importer, and
maintenance of the organism at the importer, will lead to elevated risks of disease risk compared
to regions without ports. Likewise, I believe that the assumption which leads the authors to use
pet stores as a proxy for risk arises from the possibility of consumers releasing a diseased
organism, or the disease itself, into the local environment. These both seem like reasonable
assumptions, but I think that they should be spelled out. Likewise, the complicating factor of the
internet trade, which has become a huge factor in the overall pet trade, should at least be
mentioned.
Second, although there is information here that will help decision makers, there is little specific
guidance for those decision makers. A couple of points about this: 1) eradicating or quarantining
this disease should it become established is likely to be impossible. This is mentioned, but not
explored in the context of policy. I believe that it leads to a recommendation that, to prevent Bsal
invasion, all organisms that could carry it should be prevented from import. I was surprised that
the authors did not present import restrictions as a policy alternative. 2) different policy makers
will be concerned about different types of risk. For example, if a policy maker is concerned
primarily about the risk of biodiversity loss over the long term, they would only be interested in
the maps of where Bsal is likely to have an impact, and could ignore the risk of introduction.
Likewise, a policy maker who concentrates narrowly on the trade may be most concerned with
the threat of introduction. I think that briefly exploring these issues would make the manuscript
both richer and more useful.
Some very minor comments:
Lines 66-67: All predictions are “assumption dependent”. Perhaps change this to “highlight areas
where there is disagreement”, or something similar.

Line 68: I think the nature of EIDs is that decision makers Always have to act in the face of
uncertainty.
Line 70: “decision” (not “decisions”).
Line 134: consequences were determined.

Abstract: A newly identified fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), is
responsible for mass mortality events and severe population declines in European salamanders.
The eastern USA has the highest diversity of salamanders in the world and the introduction of
this pathogen is likely to be devastating. Although data is inevitably limited for new pathogens,
disease risk assessments utilize best available data to inform management decisions. Using
characteristics of Bsal ecology, spatial data on imports and pet trade establishments, and
salamander species diversity, we identify high risk areas with both a high likelihood of
introduction and severe consequences for local salamanders. We predict that the Pacific coast,
southern Appalachian Mountains, and mid-Atlantic regions will have the highest relative risk
from Bsal. Management of invasive pathogens becomes difficult once they are established in
wildlife populations, therefore, early detection through surveillance of high risk areas is a priority
for preventing the next crisis for North American salamanders.

not particularly acquainted with using computer models the asses disease risk. However, when
ding the manuscript, I felt that the manuscript has some shortcomings, even after the authors have
e a serious effort to meet the comments of the other referees.
or remarks:
ve major concerns about several assumptions made (as mentioned by the authors is the discussion):
ential information on Bsal ecology, vectors, reservoirs, the prevalence of Bsal in traded amphibians is
ing and makes it difficult to make a profound risk assessment.
ponse: We agree that currently there is little known about Bsal and that we had to make some
umptions to complete this risk assessment. We followed the World Organization for Animal Health
ase risk assessment framework that highlights the need to make use of best available data for
ision making in the face of emerging diseases. Since prevention remains the best available option for
ing wildlife pathogens, waiting until all data is available and published on an emerging pathogen and
ly susceptible hosts (and therefore the need for fewer assumptions) may be realistically too late to
decision makers make a decision aimed at prevention.
arding the relative potential of a Bsal introduction event:
rently, we have no idea what percentage of the imported salamanders (at customs)-salamanders in
shops is Bsal positive. We have no idea what percentage of hobby-kept amphibians is Bsal positive.
articular hobby-kept amphibians are known to harbour amphibian EIDs (Ranavirus, Bd, Bsal) and,
ortunately, in Europe trade at amphibian fairs is unregulated. Is it regulated in the US? Screening of
by-kept amphibians would be an important first step. It is unfortunate that possible spread of Bsal via
and among hobbyist was not taken into account.
ponse: While there are hobbyists and hobby fairs in the U.S., we believe that they constitute a
ller fraction of amphibian trade than in Europe. As the reviewer points out, they are mostly
egulated and thus no data is available to incorporate into our risk assessment. We have tried to stress
this assessment only captures risk from one (though the most likely by volume) of many potential
oduction routes (lines 233-239).
int study of the Dutch RAVON and Gent University, evaluating the possible pathways of Bsal to and
oss the Netherlands, identified several prerequisites for the introduction of chytrid fungi in a country
spread into the environment: i) presence of the pathogen in the land of export, ii) survival of the
hogen during transport, iii) survival of the pathogen at the final destination either on the amphibian
t, water or soil and iv) release of the pathogen in the immediate environment of wild amphibians, v)
ction of free-living amphibians and vi) establishment and maintainance of the pathogen in natural
phibian populations (Spitzen-van der Sluijs et al., 2015). For spread of Bsal into the wild, e.g. via
eated waste water or release of Bsal positive amphibians, conditions (not only temperature) must be
mal before Bsal can establish and maintain within wild salamander populations.
ponse: We agree, however as the reviewer stated, information on each of these steps is lacking. We
de an assumption that the risk of Bsal introduction (e.g. the completion of all of these steps) is linearly
ted to the proxy variables of volume of trade through imports and number of pet stores. While this is a
plification of the invasion process, it is the only step of the process that currently has available data for
pathogen.
en high volumes of trade, even very small probabilities for each invasion step still results in at least
introduction event. For example, given a low probability that at least one event will occur (say 1 in
000 imports get released) but high volumes of imports (say 10e6 per year). The probability that an
phibian is released is calculated by 1 - (1 -p)^N, thus (1 - (1-0.0001)^10e6 = 1. We did model the risk
sal using estimated probabilities for each invasion step along with the qualitative analysis presented
e. We chose not to publish the quantitative results due to the large amount of missing information and
ertainty surrounding estimated probabilities. However, the results showed that given the high volume
ade in the US, introduction of Bsal in the next 10 years had a probability of 1 and was driven primarily
he volume of trade. Thus, we are fairly confident in our assumption of a linear relationship between
me of imports and risk of Bsal. We have clarified this assumption in line 107-110.
agree that more than temperature will determine suitable habitat for Bsal. However, the habitat
racteristics needed for Bsal to establish besides temperature are yet undescribed. We discuss this in
253-257.

true that the complexity of the amphibian community may affect disease risk. However, it is known
increased species richness, of both hosts and non-hosts, will reduce the impact of at least, Bd (and
bably also Bsal) (infection prevalence and intensity), by affecting host-pathogen contact rates and
smission (see for example Venesky et al., 2014). This is known as the ‘dilution effect’: increased
cies richness may work as a buffer against rapid transmission of EIDs.
ponse: You are correct that species diversity could reduce impacts on specific focal species, i.e. that
individual load for each animal may be reduced by the addition of less competent species to the
munity (i.e. the dilution effect). However, even if disease burden is reduced on individual animals,
cally adding additional host species still raises the community wide pathogen load if that pathogen is a
eralist, i.e. equal or greater transmission among than within species (Holt 2003). Additionally,
phibian species richness for Bd in the US tends to amplify disease, as the added species are often
-native reservoir hosts (e.g. American Bullfrogs, Peterson and McKenzie 2014). We have clarified the
ement (lines 155-158).
177-179: Identification of risk areas for the introduction of Bsal is an important step to prevent or limit

ponse: The US and the Netherlands and Belgium are on very different spatial scales. The area of the
herlands (41,543 sq. km) is smaller than the largest US county (San Bernardino, CA = 51,947 sq. km;
ipedia). Here we’re working on much larger spatial scales, more equivalent to a European wide risk
essment than any particular European country. For example, we incorporated risk up to 260 km (10
rs of hypothesized spread) from an introduction location. A similar spatial scale in Europe, such as
e volumes of trade through Schiphol Amsterdam Airport would include Brussels, Belgium and most of
Netherlands as an area of high risk.

mments to the Author(s)
iew of Richgels et al. submission to Royal Society Open Science.
t, although it was not specified in my invitation to review, I presume that I am seeing a revision that
been made in response to the reviews included in the pdf I downloaded. I have worked to both
ess the paper on its merits and to assess the extent to which the authors have responded to the
ews presented.
paper presents a risk model for the newly emerged amphibian disease Bsal in the US. There is a lot
oncern about this disease reaching the US, and new federal regulations on the trade in salamanders
rumored to be in the works.
ny of the criticisms made by the earlier reviewers focus on the data used to parameterize the models
eloped in this manuscript. I agree with the reviewers that data used are coarse and based on several
umptions. Thus, the use of additional or finer scale data would inevitably change the results. It’s
ortant to note, however, that the data required to build better models don’t exist. This is a new disease
one that we know very little about.
question, then, is whether there is a compelling case to use imperfect data to make broad
dictions. I believe that there is. The concern expressed about this species’ potential to invade the US,
the potential consequences if it does, are enormous. While more data would be very useful, it is also
ropriate to take the data that are presently available and build a set of ‘best possible’ predictions of
likelihood and consequences of invasion. The predictions presented here are in a form that is needed
olicy makers, and I believe that the manuscript does a reasonable job of specifying the caveats.
s, this manuscript helps to describe the risks of this species based on what we currently know. It will
oubtedly be updated as more is learned, but this is a developing issue for which policy is currently
ded.
lieve that the concerns of the reviewers have been adequately addressed. Many address the data
d, which I have commented on above. Others address the novelty of this work. While it is not the first
mpt to model the potential spread of Bsal in the US, it is novel for its different approach, and I believe
the immediacy of the Bsal threat, and the interest that has been shown in it by regulators, justifies
itional work. I don’t think that the citation rate of this paper will suffer from the previous work having
n published.
ponse: Yes, the reviewer does an excellent job summarizing why we think this paper is important and
we have pushed forward with a modeling framework in the face of imperfect data and high
ertainty.
ve two main concerns, each of which can be readily addressed.
t, I think the manuscript needs a better description of how the authors assume trade vector could lead
n invasion. The authors don’t specifically describe how proximity to a place of import affects risk of
l release. The assumption (I believe) is that the importer will be located close to the port, and that the
val of the organism at the port, transport to the importer, and maintenance of the organism at the
orter, will lead to elevated risks of disease risk compared to regions without ports. Likewise, I believe
the assumption which leads the authors to use pet stores as a proxy for risk arises from the
sibility of consumers releasing a diseased organism, or the disease itself, into the local environment.
se both seem like reasonable assumptions, but I think that they should be spelled out. Likewise, the
plicating factor of the internet trade, which has become a huge factor in the overall pet trade, should
ast be mentioned.
ponse: Yes the reviewer is correct. We assumed a linear relationship between the proximity to high
me of imports or number of stores and disease risk (see response to reviewer #1 above). This is
en almost exclusively by the probability of introduction being most strongly affected by the volume of
e (i.e. number of opportunities for a pathogen release to happen). We have clarified this assumption
nes 107-110. The pet store factor incorporates the physical location of importers and internet sellers
reported on their tax forms), but as the reviewer points out, would not include the final location of
s - such that amphibians sold and shipped long distances within the US are unaccounted for. We
e added this uncertainty to our discussion in line 233-239.
ond, although there is information here that will help decision makers, there is little specific guidance
hose decision makers. A couple of points about this: 1) eradicating or quarantining this disease
uld it become established is likely to be impossible. This is mentioned, but not explored in the context
olicy. I believe that it leads to a recommendation that, to prevent Bsal invasion, all organisms that
ld carry it should be prevented from import. I was surprised that the authors did not present import
rictions as a policy alternative. 2) different policy makers will be concerned about different types of
. For example, if a policy maker is concerned primarily about the risk of biodiversity loss over the long
, they would only be interested in the maps of where Bsal is likely to have an impact, and could
re the risk of introduction. Likewise, a policy maker who concentrates narrowly on the trade may be
st concerned with the threat of introduction. I think that briefly exploring these issues would make the
nuscript both richer and more useful.
ponse: For your first point, we did recommend import restrictions and health certificates as the best
vention policy and have strengthened this language throughout (lines 27-30 and 265-270). The
ewer raises a valid point that we could discuss the utility of the two-part risk assessment to decision
ers. We have added this to the discussion (lines 281-283).
e very minor comments:
s 66-67: All predictions are “assumption dependent”. Perhaps change this to “highlight areas where
e is disagreement”, or something similar.
ponse: Done. Changed to “More importantly, presenting multiple approaches to estimate potential
ribution of pathogen invasion will increase overall confidence in predicted areas of agreement and
light areas of disagreement, where the effect of underlying assumptions on risk predictions can be
ed should introduction of Bsal occur.”
68: I think the nature of EIDs is that decision makers Always have to act in the face of uncertainty.
ponse: Agreed, we’ve changed the wording to “Emerging infectious diseases necessitate that
ision makers make decisions in the face of uncertainty“.
70: “decision” (not “decisions”).
ponse: Done.
134: consequences were determined.
ponse: Done.
