In this manuscript, the authors report a large experiment (N=501) exploring the effect of
community size and religiosity on donations and cheating. The results show that donations to
both religious and non-religious institutions are motivated by reputational concerns. The same
result does not hold in the domain of cheating. Furthermore, neither donations nor cheating are
driven by fear of divine punishment.
Overall, the paper is interesting, and I think that a revised version of it can be published. Below is
my list of comments, in order of appearance.
Introduction
- There are some recent experiments looking at the effect of group size on cooperation that I think
should be mentioned (https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07937;
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131419;
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41988-3). These experiments are particularly
relevant because, as in the current manuscript, they look at the effect of group size on cooperation
in the aseptic setting of a laboratory experiment, rather than in the field. There are also studies
looking at group size effect on cooperation using computer simulations, which might be
mentioned (https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.84.047102).
- I am pretty sure that there is quite a lot of literature looking at the correlation between
religiosity and pro sociality. This literature should be reviewed.
- The presentation would be clearer if the authors spell out their hypotheses. They could call them
H1, H2, etc.
Participants
- The fact that participants were selected at random in public areas does not imply that the
sample is representative. For example, if one selects people during the morning, then one does
not have represented people who usually go out in the evening and nights. And so on. Plus, it is
really unlikely that people choose other people really at random. This is not a big issue, though,
just eliminate any reference to representative samples.
Method
- The description of the method is very confusing: the terminology Experiment 1 and Experiment
2 makes readers think that these are actually two different experiments. They are not. They are
actually the same experiments with two stages. They should be call Stage 1 and Stage 2.
- Please include more details about the measures of religiosity. Since these are important
measures, detailed should be included in the main text and not in the SM.
Results
- Since recent meta-analyses show that women donate more than men
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26913619;
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176518301952), I think that the
authors should discuss gender differences in donations in more details, and relate this with
earlier research
- Since recent meta-analyses show that women are more honest than men
(http://journal.sjdm.org/18/18619a/jdm18619a.html; https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-
66786-001), I think that the authors should discuss gender differences in cheating in more details,
and relate this with earlier research
- The analysis would be more convincing if the authors add an interaction term to look at
3
potential differences in the donation game vs the cheating game. It is not indeed very clear that
some results (e.g., the relation between community size and donation/cheating) hold in one cases
but not in the other one.
Discussion
- “We also detected the majority donated all the money to the institutions in our free donation
experiment, in contrast to findings that people donate between half to nothing in some other
public goods game experiments or dictator games [12,46,47]”. This is not very surprising:
donating to an institution is very different from donating to another person in the dictator game.
- “cooperate in an uncalculating decision-making to signal their generosity for reputation
concerns, behaving in a calculating way is generally perceived as a sign of doubt or uncertainty
[48,49]”. Another paper in support of the fact that uncalculating decision-making is a signal of
altruism: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804316300878
General comment
- Please revise your English. I’ve noticed several typos and mistakes.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this manuscript, the authors conduct two donation experiments (free donation game and dice
allocation game) on a large naturalistic sample of 501 people in 17 communities, with varying
religions or none, ranging from small villages to large cities. The authors want to know whether
people in small, stable communities are more cooperative than people in large, less stable
communities. They make four predictions and test them. The results show that donations to both
religious and non-religious institutions are being motivated by reputational considerations.
Besides, fear of divine punishment is not the more salient motive for cooperative behavior.
Overall, this is an interesting study. However, there are some remaining issues with the
manuscript, requiring some answers.
Major issues:
1) First, I suggest the authors explain why the number of rounds of two games is set to 2. Are the
4
environments of these two rounds the same? Are onlookers consistent?
2) The authors claim that reputational considerations can be more salient in small communities
where the people have the opportunity to get to know each other. But in my opinion, it's not just
reputation that works here. There are also other factors, such as kin selection. I believe that
excluding the influence of other factors will lead to a better understanding of the present results.
3) In the experimental design stage for free donation game, the whole game process is observable
to onlookers. I have some questions. Is the onlooker a game participant or a passer-by? Are these
onlookers familiar with the game player? Are game designers included?
4) For Dice allocation game, the authors design that the dices were unobservable by anyone
except the participant. Thus I want to know how the authors record the number of the
participants who cheated in the game.
5) How can the authors draw the following conclusion: People with higher self-reported
religiosity were more likely to donate all the money (line 12 of page 16)? What does self-reported
religiosity mean? I didn't find it again in the article.
6) In figure 3, the authors only compare the proportion of donating all in smaller communities
and large communities, and claim that those in smaller communities donating all 13.8% are more
than those in large communities. However, for other donations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), large communities
have more advantages than smaller communities. I think that it is better for authors to describe
these results and explain them.
7) In the manuscript, the authors mention divine punishment. It would be interesting to discuss
the relationship between divine punishment and the costly punishment (e.g., New J. Phys. 16
(2014) 083016, Phys. Rev. E 92 (2015) 012819, and PLoS Comput. Biol. 14 (2018) e1006347).
Minor issues:
1) In lines 37&38 of page 5, there should be a space between “[13],” and “but”.
2) In lines 14&15 of page 8, there should be a space between “1).” and “This”.
3) In lines 12&13 of page 12, “All the dice were…”should be changed to “All the dices were…”.
4) In lines 22&23 of page 13, “Akaike Information Criterion (AICc)” should be changed to
“Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)”.
5) In lines 33&34 of page 13, “in R3.4.1[42],including …” should be changed to “in R3.4.1[42],
including …”.
6) In Table 2 “n=1002”, while in Figure 5 “N=1002”. Are "n" and "N" are two different variables?
7) In lines 3&4 of page 24, “individuals’ biological market value, which underlie how to choose
partners[50,51].” should be changed to “individuals’ biological market value, which underlies
how to choose partners [50, 51].”.
8) In line 51 of page 24, “Reputational concern rather than fear of supernatural monitoring,
appear to be a more…” should be changed to “Reputational concern rather than fear of
supernatural monitoring, appears to be a more…”.
9) In lines 27&28 of page 25, “Our findings chimes with other work…” should be changed to
“Our findings chime with other work…”.
10) Finally, the format of references needs careful revision. For example, refs. 1, 13, 14, 17, 19, 22.

Answer to reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer: 1
In this manuscript, the authors report a large experiment (N=501) exploring the effect
of community size and religiosity on donations and cheating. The results show that
donations to both religious and non-religious institutions are motivated by
reputational concerns. The same result does not hold in the domain of cheating.
Furthermore, neither donations nor cheating are driven by fear of divine punishment.
Overall, the paper is interesting, and I think that a revised version of it can be
published. Below is my list of comments, in order of appearance.
Introduction
- There are some recent experiments looking at the effect of group size on cooperation
that I think should be mentioned
(https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07937; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?i
d=10.1371/journal.pone.0131419; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-
41988-3). These experiments are particularly relevant because, as in the current
manuscript, they look at the effect of group size on cooperation in the aseptic setting
of a laboratory experiment, rather than in the field. There are also studies looking at
group size effect on cooperation using computer simulations, which might be
mentioned (https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.84.047102).
Response: we thank reviewer 1 for helpful comments and suggestions. We have
cited the suggested paper.
- I am pretty sure that there is quite a lot of literature looking at the correlation
between religiosity and pro sociality. This literature should be reviewed.
Response: we have added references in Introduction section : “Multiple facets of
religion have emphasized its role as drivers of prosociality [27–31], but empirical
findings on the relationship between religiosity and prosocial behaviour are mixed
[32–35].”
- The presentation would be clearer if the authors spell out their hypotheses. They
could call them H1, H2, etc.
Response: we have added H1, H2, H3, H4 in the end of Introduction section and
echoed them in our results section.
Participants
- The fact that participants were selected at random in public areas does not imply that
the sample is representative. For example, if one selects people during the morning,
then one does not have represented people who usually go out in the evening and
nights. And so on. Plus, it is really unlikely that people choose other people really at
random. This is not a big issue, though, just eliminate any reference to representative
samples.
Response: we have deleted any words about “representative” in 2.1 Participants
section.
Method
- The description of the method is very confusing: the terminology Experiment 1 and
Experiment 2 makes readers think that these are actually two different experiments.
They are not. They are actually the same experiments with two stages. They should be
call Stage 1 and Stage 2.
Response: we have changed the terminology Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 to
“free donation game” and “dice allocation game” to make it more clear, which
means two games of one experiment. We didn’t call them Stage 1 and Stage 2 given
we call stage1 as “Choosing institutions” and stage2 as “Experiment” (As shown in
Figure 1).
- Please include more details about the measures of religiosity. Since these are
important measures, detailed should be included in the main text and not in the SM.
Response: we have added the description of the measures of religiosity as “For
measuring the religiosity, we asked about the importance of religion…… along
with the geographical distance between experiment location and the religious
institution they chose” in the end of 2.2 Measures and procedure;
At the beginning of 2.3 Statistical analysis we added “Variables measuring
participants’ religiosity are named as “Importance of religion” …… “Religious
institution distance”;
Moreover, we move our PCA of religiosity to main text as Table 1.
Results
- Since recent meta-analyses show that women donate more than men
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26913619; https://www.sciencedirect.com/sci
ence/article/pii/S0165176518301952), I think that the authors should discuss gender
differences in donations in more details, and relate this with earlier research
Response: we have discussed gender differences and added suggested literatures in
discussion section as “Furthermore, some previous studies revealed substantial
gender differences in donation behaviour…… gender difference in generosity”.
- Since recent meta-analyses show that women are more honest than men
(http://journal.sjdm.org/18/18619a/jdm18619a.html; https://psycnet.apa.org/record/20
18-66786-001), I think that the authors should discuss gender differences in cheating
in more details, and relate this with earlier research
Response: we have discussed gender differences in dice allocation game and added
suggested literatures in discussion section as “Likewise, in contrast to findings that
females…… not gender factor of individual level”.
- The analysis would be more convincing if the authors add an interaction term to
look at potential differences in the donation game vs the cheating game. It is not
indeed very clear that some results (e.g., the relation between community size and
donation/cheating) hold in one case but not in the other one.
Response: I am afraid we could only discuss these two games respectively, for in
our dice allocation game, as experimenter we have no information of whether each
individual is cheating or not, what we know and have analysis on is the level of
honesty of the whole community—comparing the distribution of each dice number
of the community to the theoretical distribution, which is, if all participants
reported honestly, then each number should appear with an equal probability of
1/6. Thus, the dice allocation game analyses in community level.
Whereas, the free donation game analyses are in individual level because we focus
on their individual division decision. Hence, we could not add an interaction term
in the analysis. Thus, we could not address the relation between community size
and donation/ cheating.
Discussion
- “We also detected the majority donated all the money to the institutions in our free
donation experiment, in contrast to findings that people donate between half to
nothing in some other public goods game experiments or dictator games [12,46,47]”.
This is not very surprising: donating to an institution is very different from donating
to another person in the dictator game.
Response: we have deleted this sentence.
- “cooperate in an uncalculating decision-making to signal their generosity for
reputation concerns, behaving in a calculating way is generally perceived as a sign of
doubt or uncertainty [48,49]”. Another paper in support of the fact that uncalculating
decision-making is a signal of
altruism: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804316300878
Response: we have added the ref to this discussion part.
General comment
- Please revise your English. I’ve noticed several typos and mistakes.
Response: we have proofread the whole paper and revised these grammatical
mistakes.
Reviewer: 2
In this manuscript, the authors conduct two donation experiments (free donation game
and dice allocation game) on a large naturalistic sample of 501 people in 17
communities, with varying religions or none, ranging from small villages to large
cities. The authors want to know whether people in small, stable communities are
more cooperative than people in large, less stable communities. They make four
predictions and test them. The results show that donations to both religious and non-
religious institutions are being motivated by reputational considerations. Besides, fear
of divine punishment is not the more salient motive for cooperative behavior. Overall,
this is an interesting study. However, there are some remaining issues with the
manuscript, requiring some answers.
Major issues:
1) First, I suggest the authors explain why the number of rounds of two games is
set to 2. Are the environments of these two rounds the same? Are onlookers
consistent?
Response: we asked the players to select two institutions to which they would like to
donate money before the gameplay. All participants undertook two games ( free
donation game and dice allocation game ), which were each performed twice, once
for each institution they selected. So that there are two rounds of two games.
Onlookers varied between rounds, apart from which the environments of these two
rounds were the same. We have added more details about calculation of onlookers
in our 2.2.1 Free donation game as “The number of onlookers……”
2) The authors claim that reputational considerations can be more salient in small
communities where the people have the opportunity to get to know each other. But in
my opinion, it's not just reputation that works here. There are also other factors, such
as kin selection. I believe that excluding the influence of other factors will lead to a
better understanding of the present results.
Response: we conducted two games, one free donation game in public and one dice
allocation in private to see their reputational considerations because in private
situation the participants shouldn't care their reputation since no one would know
if s/he cheated or not, whilst in public situation they had onlookers around so that
reputation could be more important consideration.
The local institution they donated to could benefit their kin but the effect could be
diluted by people who aren’t, so that kin selection would not be as important as
reputation.
We also referred to some relevant literatures ( such as Henrich J et al. 2010
Markets, religion, community size, and the evolution of fairness and punishment.
Science 327, 1480–1484 ), in which community size is also as a key predictor of
results of game experiment, other factors, such as kinship, reciprocity, or status
differences were not considered in their anonymous games. Here, donation objects
of our two games are institutions, which means who will benefit from the money
donated by donors depends entirely on institution, so the beneficiary is totally
anonymous to donors.
3) In the experimental design stage for free donation game, the whole game
process is observable to onlookers. I have some questions. Is the onlooker a game
participant or a passer-by? Are these onlookers familiar with the game player? Are
game designers included?
Response: we have added the explanation in 2.2.1 Free donation game as “The
number of onlookers, any passerby and subsequent or previous participant who was
around and watching, was recorded at the time of the participants were making
their donation decisions. We experimenters weren’t included as onlookers”
We also added the description of onlookers’ familiar with the game player at the
beginning of Results section as “ Participants in small communities have lived
there for much longer than those in big communities across our study sites, which
we assume is greatly increasing the likelihood that onlookers are familiar with or
previously interact with participants in small communities.”…
4) For Dice allocation game, the authors design that the dices were unobservable
by anyone except the participant. Thus I want to know how the authors record the
number of the participants who cheated in the game.
Response: Participants were asked to roll a dice in a cup, where only they could see
the result of the throw, and then report it to the experimenters. Because only
participants could see the result of the dice throw, they had the opportunity to cheat,
if they chose to do so, without detection and therefore without reputational
concerns becoming an issue.
As experimenter we have no information of whether each individual is cheating or
not, what we did is to compare the distribution of each dice number of the
community to the theoretical distribution (which is 1/6) to show the level of honesty
of the community, the same setting as ref Gächter et al 2016.
5) How can the authors draw the following conclusion: People with higher self-
reported religiosity were more likely to donate all the money (line 12 of page 16)?
What does self-reported religiosity mean? I didn't find it again in the article.
Response: we have replaced phrase of “self-reported religiosity” to “degree of
participation in public religious practice”, which is one of our component factors
( named as “Religious practice” ) of religiosity in PCA results.
6) In figure 3, the authors only compare the proportion of donating all in smaller
communities and large communities, and claim that those in smaller communities
donating all 13.8% are more than those in large communities. However, for other
donations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), large communities have more advantages than smaller
communities. I think that it is better for authors to describe these results and explain
them.
Response: We have added this analysis in supplementary Table 7, which contains a
binomial component predicting whether donating their full stake to institution and
a count component (here, with a poisson distribution) predicting the magnitude of
money donated for those who didn’t donate all.
We explained it in Results section as “Results are robust when using the donation
magnitude of those who didn’t donate the full stake as dependent variable (see
Table S7). Living in large communities and conducting more religious practice are
reliably associated with higher donation amounts, but belief in divine punishment
and reward has no overall effect”.
7) In the manuscript, the authors mention divine punishment. It would be
interesting to discuss the relationship between divine punishment and the costly
punishment (e.g., New J. Phys. 16 (2014) 083016, Phys. Rev. E 92 (2015) 012819,
and PLoS Comput. Biol. 14 (2018) e1006347).
Response: we have added these suggested references and discussed more about it in
our Discussion section as “Although theoretical modeling and lab experiments
demonstrate …… costly punishment in addressing common-pool resource or
collective actions dilemmas [79–83]”.
Minor issues:
1) In lines 37&38 of page 5, there should be a space between “[13],” and “but”.
2) In lines 14&15 of page 8, there should be a space between “1).” and “This”.
3) In lines 12&13 of page 12, “All the dice were…”should be changed to “All the
dices were…”.
4) In lines 22&23 of page 13, “Akaike Information Criterion (AICc)” should be
changed to “Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)”.
5) In lines 33&34 of page 13, “in R3.4.1[42],including …” should be changed to
“in R3.4.1[42], including …”.
6) In Table 2 “n=1002”, while in Figure 5 “N=1002”. Are "n" and "N" are two
different variables?
7) In lines 3&4 of page 24, “individuals’ biological market value, which underlie
how to choose partners[50,51].” should be changed to “individuals’ biological market
value, which underlies how to choose partners [50, 51].”.
8) In line 51 of page 24, “Reputational concern rather than fear of supernatural
monitoring, appear to be a more…” should be changed to “Reputational concern
rather than fear of supernatural monitoring, appears to be a more…”.
9) In lines 27&28 of page 25, “Our findings chimes with other work…” should be
changed to “Our findings chime with other work…”.
10) Finally, the format of references needs careful revision. For example, refs. 1,
13, 14, 17, 19, 22.
Response: we made all the changes in wording suggested.
For the 4th issue, we used second-order Akaike Information Criterion to explain
the full name of AICc, which is used for our dice allocation game analysis given
small sample size (17 community level data).
