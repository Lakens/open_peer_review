The paper reports the synthesis of zeolites Na-A and Na-X from tablet compressed and calcinated
coal fly ash. The authors used tablet compression to encourage the contact of coal fly ash with
alkalis and to intensify the calcination, so that even when Na2CO3 was used to replace the
conventional used NaOH, the Al and Si species can be completely converted into precursors for
synthesis of zeolites through hydrothermal crystallization. To my opinion, this is an original
work publishable in Royal Society Open Science. The following should be improved during the
revision.
1. I didn’t find the any discussion on the final yield and Si/Al ratio of the synthesized Na-A and
Na-X. These must be discussed in the manuscript.
2. It is technically correct to use XRD to identify products after hydrothermal synthesis, the Si and
Al precursors in coal fly ash and after calcination. The authors are also suggested to provide
associated references or PDF card numbers to support the assignments of the observed XRD
peaks.
3. The authors are suggested to compare the results with previous reports. This will make the
findings more attractive and significant.
4. The authors claimed that “The peak at 561 cm-1 confirms the presence of distorted double
(DDR-5).” This is not clear. The correct term should “The peak at 561 cm-1 can be attributed to
the vibration of distorted double five-membered-ring (DDR-5) present in the high silica
ferrierite(FER) framework.”
5. While discussing the BET surface area of Na-X and Na-A, the authors claimed that “The
organic measured BET surface area of Na-X sample is bigger than that of Na-X synthesized with
structure-directing reagents which will block some of the channels.” This claim is confusing and
should be revised.
6. Curves and photos in Figures 6 ,7 and 8 should be assigned to either Na-A or Na-X.
7. There are some typos in the manuscript (eg. On the bottom of Page 8, “the peaks of Na-X gets
intensified and sharpened and those of Na-A disappears completely”). These should be corrected
before resubmission.

It’s of great interest to develop new routes that can synthesis zeolites from low cost raw materials.
In this work, Hu and coworkers presented a thorough investigation on the synthesis of zeolites
Na-A and Na-X. They used tablet compression to enhance the contact with Na2CO3 for the
calcination and activation of Si and Al contents in coal fly ash for the hydrothermal synthesis of
zeolite Na-A and Na-X. By carefully reading, I found it may be publishable if the authors can
address the following.
1. On page 1, right above the keywords, the abbreviated terms such as SEM, BET, FT-IR and TGA
were used before definition.
2. References or PDF card numbers should be provided to support the assignment of
characteristic peaks of mullite, quartz, sodium aluminum silicate, sodium silicate, Na-A, sodalite
and Na-X in Figures 1-5.
3. It’s odd that the authors used several terms, namely IR, FTIR and FT-IR, to discuss the infrared
spectrum of Na-A and Na-X. Revisions should be made to unify these terms.
4. The authors mentioned “The peak at 561 cm-1 confirms the presence of distorted double (DDR-
5)” on page 10, 2 lines from the bottom. The term is not complete in the current version and
should be revised.
5. The authors showed the Si/Al ratio in Table 1, but the Si/Al ratio and product yields of the
synthesized Na-A and Na-X were not discussed. This should be discussed the context.
6. Though the results on synthesis of Na-A and Na-X from tablet-compression intensified
calcinated CFA are very promising, the authors are still suggested to discuss their potential
industrial applications.

Point-to-Point Response to the Reviewers’ Comments
Response to Reviewer #1:
1. I didn’t find the any discussion on the final yield and Si/Al ratio of the synthesized Na-A and Na-X. These must be discussed in
the manuscript.
Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing these out. The following were added to Page 10:
“With these setups, the yields of Na-A and Na-X are ~68% and ~62%, respectively. The relative low yield of Na-X is due to the
introduction of silica sol to get phase-pure Na-X.(Kongnoo et al. 2017)”
“We then characterized the chemical composition of synthesized Na-A and Na-X samples with XRF. The result of XRF on Na-A
sample indicates that it contains 44.64 % SiO2, 37.29 % Al2O3, 18.22 % Na2O, 3.80 % CaO, 3.36 % Fe2O3, 3.06 % TiO2, 0.55 %
MgO and 0.41 % K2O and the corresponding Si/Al molar ratio is 1.48 and is typical for commercial Na-A, while that for the Na-X
sample is 5.12.(Ameh et al. 2017; Ameh et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2016) The high Si/Al molar ratio of Na-X is due to the
introduction of silica sol to get phase-pure Na-X. (Kongnoo et al. 2017)”
2. It is technically correct to use XRD to identify products after hydrothermal synthesis, the Si and Al precursors in coal fly ash
and after calcination. The authors are also suggested to provide associated references or PDF card numbers to support the
assignments of the observed XRD peaks.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. PDF card No.s were included in the figure captions now.
3. The authors are suggested to compare the results with previous reports. This will make the findings more attractive and
significant.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We compared those results published previously when convenient.
4. The authors claimed that “The peak at 561 cm-1 confirms the presence of distorted double (DDR-5).” This is not clear. The
correct term should “The peak at 561 cm-1 can be attributed to the vibration of distorted double five-membered-ring (DDR-5)
present in the high silica ferrierite(FER) framework.”
Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have revised the term accordingly.
5. While discussing the BET surface area of Na-X and Na-A, the authors claimed that “The organic measured BET surface area of
Na-X sample is bigger than that of Na-X synthesized with structure-directing reagents which will block some of the channels.”
This claim is confusing and should be revised.
Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this typo out, we have revised the term to “The measured BET surface area of Na-X
sample is bigger than that of Na-X synthesized with structure-directing reagents which will block some of the channels.”.
6. Curves and photos in Figures 6 ,7 and 8 should be assigned to either Na-A or Na-X.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have revised the captions of Figures 6-8 accordingly.
7. There are some typos in the manuscript (eg. On the bottom of Page 8, “the peaks of Na-X gets intensified and sharpened and
those of Na-A disappears completely”). These should be corrected before resubmission.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have checked the language carefully and corrected most of them.
Response to Reviewer #2:
1. On page 1, right above the keywords, the abbreviated terms such as SEM, BET, FT-IR and TGA were used before definition.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. We revised this term to “The composition, morphology, surface area,
vibration spectrum and thermogravimetry of synthesized Na-A and Na-X were further characterized.”.
2. References or PDF card numbers should be provided to support the assignment of characteristic peaks of mullite, quartz,
sodium aluminum silicate, sodium silicate, Na-A, sodalite and Na-X in Figures 1-5.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Figure captions were revised to include the PDF card numbers.
3. It’s odd that the authors used several terms, namely IR, FTIR and FT-IR, to discuss the infrared spectrum of Na-A and Na-X.
Revisions should be made to unify these terms.
Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing these out, we have made revisions accordingly.
4. The authors mentioned “The peak at 561 cm-1 confirms the presence of distorted double (DDR-5)” on page 10, 2 lines from the
bottom. The term is not complete in the current version and should be revised.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. We have revised the term to “The peak at 561 cm-1 can be
attributed to the vibration of distorted double five-membered-ring (DDR-5) present in the high silica ferrierite (FER) framework.”.
5. The authors showed the Si/Al ratio in Table 1, but the Si/Al ratio and product yields of the synthesized Na-A and Na-X were
not discussed. This should be discussed the context.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. The following were added to Page 10:
“With these setups, the yields of Na-A and Na-X are ~68% and ~62%, respectively. The relative low yield of Na-X is due to the

6. Though the results on synthesis of Na-A and Na-X from tablet-compression intensified calcinated CFA are very promising, the
authors are still suggested to discuss their potential industrial applications.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and added the following to Page 14 to address this:
“In this sense, zeolites synthesized can principally be used as adsorbents for gas separation, wastewater treatment and soil
remediation, as heterogeneous Lewis/Bronsted acid catalysts for conversion of chemicals, as support materials for stabilization
and dispersion of catalytic reaction centers, as cation-exchange materials for resource recovery as well as other industrial
applications where Na-A and Na-X play a role.”
