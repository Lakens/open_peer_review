Comments to the Author(s)
The premise of this paper is to examine the vitrification process for fish embryos at a molecular
level. Much of the paper is an analysis of bulk water and nucleation processes. Although I cannot
speak to this aspect of the paper, it seems like a good and accurate way to understand the
freezing process. However the authors then couple this method to fish embryo cryopreservation,
and this is where I think they get into trouble. This is because date, no fish embryo has ever been
successfully cryopreserved by any method. By this I mean survive post-thaw and grow into a
fish. What is in the literature suggesting this has been successful has never been repeated,
suggesting a lack of integrity of the process.
The reasons that fish embryos have not been successfully cryopreserved are the very low
cryoprotectant permeability of the yolk, relatively low water permeability of the yolk, variable
compartments with different permeabilities and the HUGE volume of fish embryos that cause the
issue. Additionally, their membranes are rectifying, moving water easily in one direction, but not
the other, so rehydration is an enormous issue. Fish embryos can often survive vitrification
solutions, because they are not permeating… thus relatively non-toxic. The yolk of the fish
embryo is impermeable to most cryoprotectants, except methanol. The solutions outside the
embryo may vitrify, but little within the embryo will unless you pull out most of the water via
external dehydration (but generally that will kill the embryo).
I suggest that the authors change the title to “Avoiding ice nucleation when cooling biological
organisms” and keep the paper a general discussion about vitrification of biological material.
Further, I suggest that the authors completely change the introduction, because none of the
vitrification solutions they discuss will permeate the yolk of the fish embryo, except the
methanol, and who knows whether this is sufficient?
Ln 31 to 36 “their tough external protective layers” to be crystal clear. Fish had touch membranes
that act as mechanical barriers, but are permeable, such as the chorion. However, unlike the
chorion the yolk syncytial layer and other embryonic layers protecting the yolk are impermeable
to cryoprotectants. Moreover, it is not salt that causes the problem it is the low Ps of the yolk,
relatively low Lp yolk, variable compartments with different permeabilities and the HUGE
volume of fish embryos that cause the issue. The authors need to add references for many of their
statements, they make it sound like common knowledge, suggesting a lack of knowledge of the
literature.

Comments to the Author(s)
The topic of the paper is very important and of interest to the wide scientific community.
Neutron diffraction is a powerful approach to gain insight into the structural properties of
hydrogen bonded liquids, and in particular water. The study is very interesting but in its current
form the results of the work are difficult to understand in places and some of the assumptions
and conclusions which are made are not presented with enough clarity and detail to be
convincing. In part, this is a result of the manuscript being too brief in certain sections. Below are
a number of general comments about the work which, if addressed, could potentially make the
work more easily understood. But more importantly, by adding more information, the author’s
methodology and reasoning would be better presented. In doing this, the reader would be better
equipped to judge whether the work is ‘scientifically sound’-the main goal of the journal.
General comments:
The results in figure 1 are potentially very interesting, but in their current form in the manuscript
there is insufficient detail to understand them. I would suggest the authors expand on how the
experiments were completed to obtain the images in Figure 1. The experiments may well be
routine to the authors, but they will not be for all readers. If the authors wish to justify their
choice of cryoprotectant solutions based on the results in Figure 1, it is really important that they
are clearly presented. For example, why does opaqueness signal ice formation? How can other
processes be excluded, e.g. denaturing, aggregation? Or is the opaqueness a measure of the
aggregation which occurs due to the presence of ice formation? Can the authors expand on their
assumption that transparency is a measure of the degree of verification during cooling? Have
they completed control experiments with systems which are known to vitrify upon cooling and
appear transparent or can they point to such evidence in the literature. In summary, I found
Figure 1 and the accompanying text very difficult to understand and it did not get the paper off
to a good start.
One alternative solution might be to remove Figure 1 and simply introduce the cryoprotectant
solutions as interesting and important in their own right, referring to previous publications if
appropriate. However, I would encourage the former approach, as the results of Figure 1 add
value to the paper, as they go beyond previous work which has only used neutron diffraction to
study cryoprotectant solutions (e.g. sarcosine, glycerol, trehalose studies).
In the sample preparation method the authors could expand on the timescales involved when
‘container was quickly withdrawn and loaded into the temperature insert’………and ‘’’ the
temperature of the insert was quickly reduced to 77K…’. Was this a matter of minutes? Was it the
4
same for each sample? It might be helpful to include a temperature protocol figure e.g. see Nature
communications, 4, 2844 (2013)
Figure 4 reveals the main outcome of the work. The result is very interesting but it would be
more valuable if the authors used their data to go beyond one snapshot of the system. If water is
confined to small volumes in the cryoprotectant solution, what are the dimensions of these
volumes? Do the nanoclusters of water vary in size over a wide range? Are isolated water
molecules present or are clusters more prevalent? In summary, it would be interesting to have
more quantitative insight into the hydrogen bonding of water in the system, as this is the beauty
of using the neutron diffraction/epsr approach. I’m afraid that with only one snapshot, critics
will be sceptical.
Specific comments/questions:
-Can the authors justify the statement that ‘Preservation of fish embyros represents one of the
most important unsolved problems in cryobiology’.
-Why is ice with a dimension of 10 nm a ‘microcrystal’? (page 3)
-Do the authors have or is there any published data on the freezing point of the cryoprotective
solutions tested? Have any micro-calorimetry studies been completed?

Comments to the Author(s)
As I stated previously, this paper seems like an excellent description of the behavior of water
during the vitrification process. The issues that I had, and still have, are related to the biological
assumptions of the paper.
One particular problem I have with papers on the cryopreservation of fish embryos is that
authors generally do not move in a stepwise fashion trying to reveal the physical and biological
issues of their fish model. Some papers only deal with a myriad of solutions examining toxicity
while other ones deal just with freezing. This paper falls more into the later category
concentrating on freezing but with a lack of permeability and toxicity data or reference to them.
You cannot do one without the other. There is no data on the permeability of the carp shown or
referred to here to determine how much water they were pulling out of the embryo with their
cryoprotectants over the 5 or so min of exposure. They do mention previous work (ref #9) on
using alcalase to permeabilize the carp chorion, but the chorion is not necessarily a barrier to
water or cryoprotectants, it is more a mechanical protection (except in the case of salmonids). So
it is not the problem. Water permeability is generally low in fish embryos, at least in zebrafish
embryos, but it is the surface to volume, or physical size of the embryo, which causes much of the
issues of water getting out. Pair that with complex permeability of the yolk and blastoderm and
that creates a lot of assumptions to make without real data. They do add methanol in the cocktail
to permeate the yolk, but generally, anything above 10% methanol is toxic to fish embryos. It
would be particularly important to show the toxicity of these solutions to their fish embryos,
which I do not see in this paper. Permeability and toxicity are key elements to success, and I
understand that they are using the fish embryo as a model for their chemistry, but why do a
whole paper on a process with potentially dead tissue? Although these authors show three really
8
nice images of the embryos in various stages of success of vitrification, these data are somewhat
meaningless because I believe the embryos in all cases are dead because of either lethal ice
formation as in Fig. 1a and b or toxicity to methanol as in Fig 1 c.

Dear Emilie,
We have considered your comments and made the following changes accordingly. The changes are
highlighted in yellow in the revised manuscript:-
“We note that reference 9 (Survival of common carp Cyprinus Carpio embryos after chorion
modification by alcalase and following incubation in vitrifying solutions), on which much of your
paper is based is not easily available online. We therefore ask that you explicitly state in your revised
manuscript that embryos do not survive vitrification but that as you state " the embryo could
apparently survive treatment (i.e. did not show ice formation with vitrification) with the present
cryoprotective solution (samples 4-7) and that this same solution also does not show ice formation
when rapidly cooled to 77K on its own. Other solutions that DID show ice formation in the common
carp embryos also showed ice formation when rapidly cooled (samples 3,8,9)."”
Our response: This point is now may made in a new paragraph, under “Concluding remarks” at the
very end of the paper.
“You should also include hatching and survival data to show that the embryos continued to develop
normally, rather than simply staying intact after exposure to the solution.”
Our response: These data are now included in an extended second paragraph on Page 3.
“Please also include full details of animal care of fish and of ethical approval for the study, if this was
obtained and detail the developmental stage of the embryo on exposure to vitrification.”
Our response: A separate ethical statement that covers these issues is added at the end of the
paper.
“Our advisor acknowledges that vitrification of embryos is very challenging and commends your
efforts they feel your manuscript would be much improved if you more fully acknowledged the
limitations of this work so that you basically say to readers 'this is a hard problem, we think the
embryos were intact when they went into the vitrifaction process, and may be intact in the frozen
state in one scenario (Fig 1 c), and now we are going to look at water under these three scenarios to
perhaps better get a feeling of how we might overcome the severe issues with thawing.'”
Our response: The extra paragraph at the very end of the paper, already alluded to, now also makes
these additional points.
In addition, the source of funding for one of the investigators (BD) is now acknowledged.
We hope you will deem these changes a satisfactory response to your queries.
Yours sincerely,
Alan K. Soper
