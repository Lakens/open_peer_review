General comments
In their manuscript Hobeika and colleagues investigated the effect of social interaction in the
immediate reshaping of the PPS. They took advantage of a widely used paradigm, slightly
manipulated to answer their research question.
The results showed that only during collaboration with a partner the boundaries pf the PPS
expand in the right hemispace.
The idea is very interesting and the study very well designed.
Incredibly clear and detailed methods section. It is the first manuscript I read in my life where I
do not need to read the methods section twice to grasp the whole methodology. I really thank the
authors for their clarity.
I have some comments that I am listing below, and that I would like the authors to address before
recommending the manuscript for publication.
Major
It is not clear to me why the analyses use the hemispace variable (left vs right) instead of the side
where the confederate was sitting. In line with Teneggi’s study, I would expect the PPS to expand
after cooperative activity towards the side of the confederate. Therefore I would expect an initial
analysis to investigate this hypothesis. Could authors please justify the choice of analysing the
hemispaces instead of the confederate location? I do understand that given that lateral PPS is
asymmetric for right-handers, it makes sense to analyse separately each hemispace. But why not
considering whether in that hemispace there was a confederate sitting or not?
I could not find clear hypotheses about the modulation of the PPS in each hemispace based on the
confederate presence. Without some hypotheses, the analyses presented by the authors sound
quite post-hoc.
Figure 2. In the RH participants performed differently when in dyad as compared to when in
isolation. In the “dyad” graph authors report that “The significant decrease of RTs corresponding
to the critical delay at which sound starts to boost tactile processing is indicated by means of red
asterisks.” How did authors decide that the boundaries of PPS is between T4 and T3, and not for
example between T8 and T6, where another significant difference in RTs was found?
I did not find really exhaustive the explanation of the PPS expansion in the right hemispace
during collaborative activity. Could authors please try to speculate more about why the right and
not the left hemispace is reshaped during a collaborative interaction?
And also, why not the hemispace where the confederate was sitting?

This paper investigates an audiotactile interaction task for stimuli in or out peripersonal space
(PPS) presented in a social context. Participants had to detect as fast as possible a tactile stimulus
while task-irrelevant looming sounds were presented, when they were paired as collaborative or
competitive dyads, or in the presence of an inactive individual. Results suggest that PPS extended
when participants collaborated with a partner, obviously to adapt individual motor control to an
interaction with a social context. This underlines the effect of the need to interact with others on
low-level spatial perception.
The papers presents a well conducted study with interesting outcome. There is several points that
need to be considered before publication. First, the originality of the study is mitigated by the
lack of quotation of publications that are relevant with respect to the research topic. In particular,
one paper (and a chapter) has addressed the same issue and needs to be quoted and discussed.

the group of Iachini have been evaded:

The second point is that the data analysis should consider all variables. The statistical analysis
should be performed including the side effect and I recommend performing a 3 way Anova
including Condition x Side x SOA.
The third point is that the interpretation of the data are in some aspects overinterpreting the
results. It is indeed no fully obvious that in Exp 1 “… results show that PPS right boundaries
were farther away when participants were performing the task together with another individual
than when they were isolated. “
- The comparisons are made only between SOAs, which cannot guaranty against artefacts in the
context of multiple comparisons. It is thus important to show that RT also changes across
conditions for similar SOA.
- The fact that there is no effect of the location of the confederate (right or left) on the extent of
right PPS weakened the interpretation that is proposed. What is observed is that, in both the
individual and social conditions, there is a decreasing slope of RT depending on the distance, but
with non-equivalent local effects. The slope is steeper in the social condition (which could be
tested), claiming for a boost of RT in the social context. However, the lack of effect on the left side
makes the interpretation of the results difficult. Furthermore, the boost effect is observed both
sides in the competition condition. Accordingly, claiming that “PPS extent is sensitive to a high-
level social instruction of collaboration” seems overstepping, considering that this is actual only
on the right side (Exp1). Although the conclusions should be tempered, the fact that the effect
was not observed on the left side could be related to the fact that the response was always
delivered with the right hand. A control experiment with the response provided by the left hand
could be valuable to better understand the articulation of the effects reported. It is also not clear
why a side by side condition will produce an extension of PPS. Extension of PPS was obtained in
a social context when two facing confederates performed a collaborative task (Teneggi et al. 2013;
Coello et al., 2018). Perhaps, this could be argued.
Minor points
Method
- What is the role of the visual target ? How long was it displayed ?
- Concerning the conditions, there is 2 contexts (isolated, social), 2 directions (right, left ) and 11
time delays. I thus wouldn’t say that there is 22 conditions (but 44), with 10 trials in each. Also,
the authors mention 22 conditions with 10 target stimuli in each, it is thus not clear why there is
440 trials.
- Concerning the seating condition, (left/right) it must be indicated if this condition was
within/between subjects.
Figure 1 shows an exact location for T1 to T9 according to the participant. How were these
location determined (time to contact ?), were they perceived similarly by all participants (it is
indicated that” The absolute distance estimation of sound sources is usually a difficult task for
non-familiar stimuli in absence of reference, in which participants are not accurate). It would be
interested to have an information concerning at which distance multisensory integration occurs
for each participant.
- Page 7. “RTs were significantly faster when the tactile stimulus occurred at T4 compared to
5
when the tactile stimulus occurred at T5”. This is counterintuitive and seems the opposite to
what is reported Figure 2.

Appendix A
We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewers for their comments. Thanks to them, we have
understood that one of the main experimental condition of the study, i.e. the effect of the partner position
n space, was confusing. We have modified the manuscript to clarify the theoretical importance of this factor.
We also modified the name of this factor for the statistical analysis throughout the manuscript. It was
previously called “ SEATING”, and is now called “PARTNER POSITION”.

1) It is not clear to me why the analyses use the hemispace variable (left vs right) instead of the
ide where the confederate was sitting. In line with Teneggi’s study, I would expect the PPS to
expand after cooperative activity towards the side of the confederate. Therefore I would expect an
nitial analysis to investigate this hypothesis. Could authors please justify the choice of analysing
he hemispaces instead of the confederate location? I do understand that given that lateral PPS is
asymmetric for right-handers, it makes sense to analyse separately each hemispace. But why not
considering whether in that hemispace there was a confederate sitting or not? I could not find
clear hypotheses about the modulation of the PPS in each hemispace based on the confederate
presence. Without some hypotheses, the analyses presented by the authors sound quite post-hoc.
n our study, we wanted to examine if the presence of a cooperative, competitive or inactive partner
modulates lateral PPS. We expected that we would observe a modulation of PPS boundaries in social
ontexts, and this modulation would be dependent of the valence of the interaction. In line with Tennegi et
al (2013) we predicted that PPS would expend in presence of a cooperative partner, and contract in
presence of a competitive one. As reviewer 1, we expected this expansion to be observed only in the
direction of the partner. We added this hypothesis on the last but one paragraph of the introduction (lines
97-112)
n order to test this hypothesis, we included 4 experimental factors in the experiments. There were three
within subject factors: HEMISPACE (2 levels: Left/Right), which corresponds to the location of the sound
ource in space, SOCIAL CONDITION (2 levels: Isolated/In Dyad), which refers to the fact that participants
performed the task alone or in presence of a partner; and DELAY (8 levels: T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9),
which refers to the delay between the sound onset and the time of tactile delivery, and is related to the
distance of the sound source in space. There was one between subject factor: the PARTNER POSITION (2
evels: Left/Right) which corresponds to the fact that the partner could be seated at the left or the right
ide of the participant in the dyad condition.
1
n line with previous work, we expected lateral PPS to be asymmetrical for right-handers participants
Hobeika et al. 2018), with a larger PPS in the left hemispace than in the right hemispace. This asymmetry
was replicated in the current study. Thus, as audiotactile integration is different in left and right
hemispaces when participants are alone, we tested its social modulation separately in the two
hemispaces. This choice allowed to increase the statistical power of the analysis, considering the large
number of conditions in the experiments. We performed an ANOVA on the data obtained in each
hemispace, including the within subjects factors SOCIAL CONDITION and DELAY, and the between
ubjects factor PARTNER POSITION.
The analysis tested if potential PPS social modulations were in direction of the partner, by including the
actor PARTNER POSITION. There was no main effect of the factor PARTNER POSITION, and no
nteraction of this factor with the SOCIAL CONDITION. Therefore, we obtained the surprising result that
PPS was modulated in collaborative contexts only in the right hemispace, and independently of the
partner position.
2) Figure 2. In the RH participants performed differently when in dyad as compared to when in
solation. In the “dyad” graph authors report that “The significant decrease of RTs corresponding
o the critical delay at which sound starts to boost tactile processing is indicated by means of red
asterisks.” How did authors decide that the boundaries of PPS is between T4 and T3, and not for
example between T8 and T6, where another significant difference in RTs was found?
PPS is the space close to the body coded by multisensory neurons. Multisensory integration leads to a
aster detection of stimuli. Thus, multisensory events occurring in the PPS are detected faster than outside
he PPS.
To determine the boundary of PPS in space, we take the furthest distance from participants’ body at which
he presence of a sound boosted tactile detection. Reaction times further decrease after the first boost, as
he sound comes closer within PPS: the distance between the auditory and the tactile stimulus continues
o influence tactile reaction time. The closer the two sensory stimuli, the stronger the multisensory boost
of the detection times is.
This explanation is in the manuscript in the last paragraph of the introduction, lines 116-121: “As such,
participants perceived the sound source at different distances from their body when they processed the
actile stimulus (from the farthest distance at T1 to the closest distance at T9). As the delay increased,
he looming sound was perceived as closer. It is now well established that a sound speeds up tactile
detection when located near, but not far from, the body, i.e. within PPS [32,33]. Consequently, we
ought for the distance from participants’ body, at which sound starts to boost tactile RTs as a proxy
of PPS boundaries.”
3) I did not find really exhaustive the explanation of the PPS expansion in the right hemispace
during collaborative activity. Could authors please try to speculate more about why the right and
not the left hemispace is reshaped during a collaborative interaction? And also, why not the
hemispace where the confederate was sitting?
We have speculated more about the possible interpretation of the asymmetry in the social modulation of
PPS in the discussion, lines 419-430:
« Second, our experiments used looming sounds. A looming event is the sign of possible body threats,
and can elicit the production of defensive behaviours [52–54]. PPS modulations in our experiments
2
may be linked to defensive/protective behaviours [31]. In isolation, right-handers PPS is larger in the
hemispace of their non-dominant hand, where actions implementation is slower and less precise, and
hus requires a larger protection margin [30]. In the collaborative experiment, the PPS extension of
he right hemispace could be the mark of an extended protection space for the group. Individuals may
enlarge their defensive action space in the hemispace of their dominant hand in order to be able to use
t to defend a group member. This proposal is speculative, but it is consistent with a study suggesting
hat the area of defensive reactions at potential threats could increase in the presence of another
ndividual [43]. The absence of extension in the left hemispace may be linked to a ceiling effect: since
he left PPS is already larger for right-handed individuals, it may not require to be further enlarged in
ocial conditions. »

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper investigates an audiotactile interaction task for stimuli in or out peripersonal space
PPS) presented in a social context. Participants had to detect as fast as possible a tactile stimulus
while task-irrelevant looming sounds were presented, when they were paired as collaborative or
competitive dyads, or in the presence of an inactive individual. Results suggest that PPS extended
when participants collaborated with a partner, obviously to adapt individual motor control to an
nteraction with a social context. This underlines the effect of the need to interact with others on
ow-level spatial perception.
1) The papers presents a well conducted study with interesting outcome. There is several points
hat need to be considered before publication. First, the originality of the study is mitigated by the
ack of quotation of publications that are relevant with respect to the research topic. In particular,
one paper (and a chapter) has addressed the same issue and needs to be quoted and discussed.

Thank you for this remark. We are aware that there are several published studies on the management of
pace in social contexts. However, just few of those studies specifically concentrate on multisensory
ntegration related to social context, as Heed et al. 2010, Tennegi et al. 2013 and Pellencin et al 2017. We
ocus the manuscript’s introduction on the literature about the link between multisensory integration and
he space close to the body to avoid misconceptions, and we have clarified this in the manuscript.
Peripersonal space, which is coded by multisensory neurons, is usually depicted as the space around the
body coded in motor terms for the purpose of defensive actions, or for the implementation of reaching
actions. Multiple methodologies have been developed to study peripersonal space based on those
haracteristics. They can be divided in three main categories: multisensory integration based methods,
eaching space based methods and defensive function based methods. However, there is no consensus on
whether those methods are related to the same cognitive phenomenon, and whether there is a unique
epresentation of the peripersonal space. De Vignemont and Iannetti (2014) argue for the possibility of
wo different peripersonal spaces, distinguishing for defensive actions and reaching actions. Cléry and
olleagues (2014) also support the idea that there could be two different neural systems to support safety
actions and reaching actions.
Lastly, peripersonal space is usually discussed in regards to the large literature of social psychology on
personal space, i.e. the space near the body in which others cannot intrude without causing discomfort.
Personal space is measured with high-level cognitive tasks, in which participants evaluate the distance
between them and others with which they feel comfortable to interact, for example to have a
onversation. Again, there is no consensus on the fact that personal space and peripersonal space rely on
4
he same mechanisms. As an example, Patané et al (2017) found distinct modulations of personal space
and reachability space after a collaborative task.
The articles suggested by the reviewer are studies on reaching space and the social personal space. We do
not want to emphasize on this literature in the introduction to avoid confusion between the concepts.
However, we agree with the reviewer that it is important to refer to this literature. In this new version of
he manuscript, we refer to the literature on social influence on space processing in the introduction and
n the discussion, where we have added and briefly discussed several of the suggested references.
2) The second point is that the data analysis should consider all variables. The statistical analysis
hould be performed including the side effect and I recommend performing a 3 way Anova
ncluding Condition x Side x SOA.
Thanks a lot for pointing out that the analysis did not emphasize enough all the factors taken into account.
The first reviewer also made this remark (see point 1). The presentation of our manuscript was indeed
not clear enough to understand that the side effect was included in the performed analyses. This has been
orrected.
3) The third point is that the interpretation of the data are in some aspects overinterpreting the
esults. It is indeed no fully obvious that in Exp 1 “… results show that PPS right boundaries were
arther away when participants were performing the task together with another individual than
when they were isolated. “
The comparisons are made only between SOAs, which cannot guaranty against artefacts in the
context of multiple comparisons. It is thus important to show that RTs also changes across
conditions for similar SOA.
n the collaborative experiment, the anova revealed a significant interaction between the Social Condition
isolated/alone) and the Delay (8 levels) in the right hemispace. To understand this interaction, we
performed Newman-Keuls’ post-hoc tests. Newman Keuls’ post-hoc tests correct for multiple
omparisons, thus diminish the probability of observing false positive.
We hypothesized that this significant interaction could be due to a difference in PPS extent
between the isolated and dyad conditions. Thus, we determined PPS extent on both social conditions by
ooking at speed up effects within each condition (based on previous studies analysis like Canzoneri et al
2012). The analysis revealed a difference in PPS extent. Then, we looked at differences in RTs between the
ocial conditions, for each delay separately. We found no significant differences of RTs across social
onditions.
We agree with the reviewer that significant differences of RTs for similar delays across social
onditions would be an important argument to support our conclusion. However, in the absence of
ignificant differences of RTs across social conditions, the comparison of RTs within each social condition
s the best way to explain the significant interaction between the social conditions and the delays.
The fact that there is no effect of the location of the confederate (right or left) on the extent of
ight PPS weakened the interpretation that is proposed. What is observed is that, in both the
ndividual and social conditions, there is a decreasing slope of RT depending on the distance, but
with non-equivalent local effects. The slope is steeper in the social condition (which could be
ested), claiming for a boost of RT in the social context. However, the lack of effect on the left side
makes the interpretation of the results difficult. Furthermore, the boost effect is observed both
ides in the competition condition. Accordingly, claiming that “PPS extent is sensitive to a high-
evel social instruction of collaboration” seems overstepping, considering that this is actual only on
he right side (Exp1). Although the conclusions should be tempered, the fact that the effect was not
observed on the left side could be related to the fact that the response was always delivered with
5
he right hand. A control experiment with the response provided by the left hand could be valuable
o better understand the articulation of the effects reported. It is also not clear why a side by side
condition will produce an extension of PPS. Extension of PPS was obtained in a social context when
wo facing confederates performed a collaborative task (Teneggi et al. 2013; Coello et al., 2018).
Perhaps, this could be argued.
We agree that the present results are puzzling and can be seen as controversial at first. However, taking
an approach considering the asymmetry of PPS for right-handers, and the potential functional role of PPS,
we can propose a congruent explanation to these findings. Here are some answers to the duly justified
omments of the reviewer:
> The fact that there is no effect of the location of the confederate (right or left) on the extent of
ight PPS weakened the interpretation that is proposed.
The fact that the PPS modulation is not dependent of the partner position is clearly surprising, but to our
opinion it does no weakened the results. On the contrary, we think that this result can lead to new
nterpretations of results of PPS in social contexts, and to new theoretical approaches on the management
of space in social contexts. For example, Teneggi et al. (2012) argue that in a cooperative context, PPS
extend to include the partner. This hypothesis does not stand if the extension is not dependent of the
partner position.
Experiments on social modulations of PPS always place two individuals facing each others, and measure
PPS extent in one direction only: in the frontal space where the confederate is located. Thus, it is not
possible to conclude if PPS modulations are in the direction of the confederate, or changes in the front
whatever the partner position. Our study is the first to tackle this question. We have better explained this
n the last but one paragraph of the introduction, lines 97-112.
> What is observed is that, in both the individual and social conditions, there is a decreasing slope
of RT depending on the distance, but with non-equivalent local effects. The slope is steeper in the
ocial condition (which could be tested), claiming for a boost of RT in the social context.
Here the reviewer suggests to model RTs with lines, and to compare their slopes. However, in our
experiments, RTs modulations in space do not follow a linear decrease. We actually observe a plateau for
ar distances, then boosts of RTs at critical closer distances.
> However, the lack of effect on the left side makes the interpretation of the results difficult
A previous study demonstrated that lateral PPS is asymmetrical for right-handers, with a larger extent in
he left side than the right side (Hobeika et al 2018). Considering this natural asymmetry of PPS extent for
ight-handed participants when doing the task alone, it is not surprising to find an anisotropy in the
modulation of PPS in social contexts. We hypothesize that the left side being naturally larger, does not
equire to be further enlarged in social conditions (lines 431-442).
> Furthermore, the boost effect is observed both sides in the competition condition.
We do not see this result as weakening the interpretation that PPS extent is sensitive to a high-level social
nstruction of collaboration. To the opposite, we think this provides evidence that inducing a competitive
ontext does not impact PPS definition but just globally boosts reaction times, leaving the individual
patial definition of PPS unchanged.
> Although the conclusions should be tempered, the fact that the effect was not observed on the
eft side could be related to the fact that the response was always delivered with the right hand. A
ontrol experiment with the response provided by the left hand could be valuable to better
understand the articulation of the effects reported.
6
n the present study, participants received tactile simulations on one hand and responded with the other
hand. Previous findings suggest that peri-hand PPS merges with peri-trunk PPS when hands are located
near the body (Serino et al. 2015). Our aim was therefore to study peri-trunk PPS by applying tactile
timulation on the non-dominant hand, with both hands positioned in contact with the trunk. However,
we cannot exclude the possibility that the present results are somehow associated to the peri-hand PPS of
he non-dominant hand. An experiment using the left hand would not be the ideal control, as the task is
based on speed-up effects and right-handers individuals are slower to respond with the left hand.
However, following this remark, we have added more precision in the text, lines 121-125: “. In order to
measure PPS of participants’ trunk, participants were instructed to keep their hands aligned with their
mid-sagittal plane and in contact to their body [34]. With this instruction, the paradigm aimed at
measuring PPS of participants’ trunk [34]. However, we can not exclude the possibility that our
measure is somehow associated to the peri-hand PPS of the responding hand.”
> It is also not clear why a side by side condition will produce an extension of PPS. Extension of
PPS was obtained in a social context when two facing confederates performed a collaborative task
Teneggi et al. 2013; Coello et al., 2018). Perhaps, this could be argued.
Seating side by side a more neutral, less confrontational organization than face to face, that individuals
pontaneously adopt to collaborate (Sommers R., 1965). Thus, this configuration is prone to highlighting a
eorganization of the action space when individuals collaborate.
To our knowledge, there is no published study on PPS modulation in participants seated side by side.
However, we describe in the introduction one experiment where the processing of stimuli in space is
modulated for collaborating individuals seated side by side (second paragraph 2, lines 47-57). Following
he comment of reviewer 1, we have also speculated more on why a side by side configuration would
produce an extension of PPS (see discussion, paragraph 5 line 394-409 and paragraph 7, lines 419-430).
Minor points
Method
What is the role of the visual target? How long was it displayed?
Because we wanted to avoid interactions between eye position and sound processing (e.g. Gruters et al
2017), we used a visual target to control for the gaze direction and visual stimulation of participants. The
visual target was displayed during the whole duration of the experiment. Those information have been
added in the manuscript lines 134-136.
« To control for the visual stimulation and gaze direction, participants were instructed to fix a permanent
visual target located at 65cm in front of them ”
Concerning the conditions, there is 2 contexts (isolated, social), 2 directions (right, left ) and 11
ime delays. I thus wouldn’t say that there is 22 conditions (but 44), with 10 trials in each. Also, the
authors mention 22 conditions with 10 target stimuli in each, it is thus not clear why there is 440
rials.
Thank you for your attention. This mistake is now corrected. There are indeed 44 conditions.
Concerning the seating condition, (left/right) it must be indicated if this condition was
within/between subjects.

Figure 1 shows an exact location for T1 to T9 according to the participant. How were these
ocation determined (time to contact ?), were they perceived similarly by all participants (it is
ndicated that” The absolute distance estimation of sound sources is usually a difficult task for
non-familiar stimuli in absence of reference, in which participants are not accurate). It would be
nterested to have an information concerning at which distance multisensory integration occurs
or each participant.
The exact locations of the sound source in space for T1 to T9 correspond to the theoretical distances used
o create the looming sound, based on physical laws of sound propagation.
The looming sound were synthetized using the Spat library of the Max/MSP(6.1.8) environment. The
echnique uses the Head-Related Transfer Function filters (or HRTF) that characterize the transformation
of the signal during its propagation from a particular point in space to the entrance of the listener’s ear
anals. The HRTFs convey all the above described acoustical cues linked to interaural differences as well
as to spectral cues caused by the diffraction on the listener’s torso, head and pinnae. In addition to HRTFs,
he reflections and the reverberation of the room are added, and the sound intensity of the direct sound is
modulated to create a perception of moving sound in three dimensions.
The following table depicts the theoretical correspondences between time delays and distances from
participants’ body. As we point out in the manuscript, the absolute distance estimation of stationary sound
ources is usually a difficult task, in which participants are not accurate for non-familiar sounds. However,
participants are accurate in the comparison of distances between two sources at different distances. In
our task, we are using looming sounds, and compare the effect of continuously varying sound distances. As
distance perception in depth is accurate for relative comparison but not in term of absolute distance, we
decided to present the results in terms of delay from the sound onset and not in terms of geometrical
distances. We emphasized on this point in the manuscript to explain that we do not give a metric of PPS
extent in space, as it could be misleading, but we added the theoretical range of distance in the third
paragraph of the methods, line 157 - 158.
We agree that having information about participants’ absolute distances estimation could be interesting.
However, there is no efficient and reliable method that can be easily and rapidly used to test it.
Nevertheless, we systematically checked that the sound was perceived as looming towards participants’
body.

reported Figure 2.

Thank you again for your attentive reading. This was indeed a mistake. RTs were actually faster when the
actile occurred at T5 compared to T4. We corrected this in the manuscript.
