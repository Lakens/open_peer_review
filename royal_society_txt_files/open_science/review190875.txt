The paper by Eriksson et al. presents highly interesting data on the influence of olfactory input on
central neuropil volumes in a butterfly, by separating the influence of sensory input from
behavioural and cognitive activity. The authors convincingly show that AL volumes are
influenced by antennal sensory input, whereas mushroom body calyces, serving as secondary
olfactory centre, are not. They show thus that earlier described experience-dependent changes in
mushroom body calyces are most likely not due to sensory input alone, but caused by cognitive
or behavioural activity.
The paper is very well written and illustrated and I only have a few minor comments as detailed
below.
Line 54: …olfactory cues…
Line 136: what do you mean with “simultaneously filled”? Do you mean that individual insects
hatching at the same time were randomly attributed to on of three experimental groups?
Material and methods: it took me a while to understand what the difference between control and
baseline group was. The easiest thing to clarify this would be to simply change to control group
(instead of groups) in line 153 (or include age for each group to clarify?)
Line 183/84: Your point 3 is incomplete: I would mention that lack of olfactory input prevented
expansion of the ipsilateral AL and reduced the expansion of the contralateral AL significantly.

This study shows convincingly that the mechanisms underlying the growth of antennal lobes and
mushroom bodies differ, and that olfactory input seems a main factor of AL development during
early adulthood of the Comma butterfly. In my opinion, there are a few points that should be
addressed:
1. Some aspects of the Methods section should be clarified or completed. For example, were the
animals used for axonal tracing the same as those of the ‘baseline group’ in the second
experiment? If not, how old were they? In the Results and figures, the ‘baseline group’ is actually
referred to as ‘newly eclosed’ animals: please use only one name for this group throughout the
manuscript. In that same experiment, it is said that the control group underwent no further
treatment following immobilization, but it did as it was exposed to the same olfactory context as
the treated one. Finally, what was the delay between wax treatment and exposure to the olfactory
context?
2. The sample size differs, within the ‘olfactory blockage’ group, for measurements of AL and MB
volumes (18 and 20, respectively), and as shown by the raw data, in some brains only the ALs
were measured, and only the MBs in others (probably due to technical reasons). This might
introduce a possible bias, as comparing the growth patterns of ALs and MBs should be based on
measurements performed in the same brains. I suggest to exclude the brains whose analysis was
incomplete from the dataset.
3. Olfactory blocking has a specific meaning in the field of behavioural studies (see e.g. Guerrieri
et al 2005), so I recommend avoiding its use in the present study. I suggest ‘blockade of olfactory
input’ or ‘olfactory blockade’ instead.
l.80: It is not clear to me why the authors mention the calyx as the input region and the lobes as
the main processing region – the lobes are the main output region, and there is quite some
processing occurring in the calyces, so unless I am missing strong arguments to maintain this
dichotomy, I’d rather oppose the calyx and lobes as input and output regions, rather than
involved or not in information processing.
l.277: what is a ‘neutral’ environment? Do you mean less complex? Comparatively poorer in
terms of sensory stimuli? Please clarify.
4
l. 306-310: the ‘cognitive challenge’ in the cited studies was the establishment of an olfactory
associative memory. In the present experiment, it is likely that butterflies have established such a
memory as they were fed while smelling specific plant odorants during several days, even if they
were immobilized (which was actually the case in the bee study). Thus, the hypothesis that MGD
would not be affected in this experiment seems to lack strong support, while the opposite seems
more likely. I suggest to modify that part of the manuscript accordingly.
l.316-317: why do the authors consider that the lack of AL expansion on the treated side indicate
that expansion later in life is unlikely? I fail to see the logic, here - although it is clear that in many
insect species the first days or week of adult life is a critical period for experience-dependent
neuropilar growth (see e.g. Groh & Meinertzhagen, 2010; Cabirol et al. 2017)

Line 54: …olfactory cues… Fixed
Line 136: what do you mean with “simultaneously filled”? Do you mean that individual insects hatching at the same time
were randomly attributed to on of three experimental groups?
Yes, exactly. As the phrasing was a bit unclear, the two last sentences of that paragraph are now merged and we hope that
he change will make it clearer as to what we want to express.
Immobilization was conducted one hour after eclosion, allowing wings to inflate and cuticle to harden before being
handled, and butterflies were then haphazardly assigned to one out of three treatment groups.)
Material and methods: it took me a while to understand what the difference between control and baseline group was. The
asiest thing to clarify this would be to simply change to control group (instead of groups) in line 153 (or include age for each
roup to clarify?)
The s in groups on line 153 was there because we were referring to both the olfactory blockage group and the control
roup at the same time, but the sentence is now changed so that it is more clear which groups we really are talking about
here. We also added the age at which animals of the baseline group were sacrificed on line 151/152. Please note that we
lso changed “baseline” to “newly eclosed” as reviewer 2 pointed out our inconsistent terminology.
Line 183/84: Your point 3 is incomplete: I would mention that lack of olfactory input prevented expansion of the ipsilateral
AL and reduced the expansion of the contralateral AL significantly.
t was our intention that point 2 would make it clear that lack of olfactory input prevented expansion of ipsilateral AL, but
we agree that your suggestion greatly improves clarity here.
Line 195/196: and projecting further to the lateral horn? Yes, changed to “and projecting further to the…”
Line 198: “expression” is misleading, rather use something like “strong staining”? Changed “expression” to “fluorescent
taining”
Result part on antennal lobes page 11: You don’t mention in the text, that also the contralateral AL of the blockage group is
ignificantly smaller than the AL in control insects. As you discuss that point later, it would be good to mention this here
lready (even if it is mentioned in the figure legend).
t is mentioned in a sentence on line 221-224 that AL of the untreated hemisphere among olfactory blockage animals are
maller than the AL of control animals, but as it is quite hidden in the text we added a sentence to the final comment (line
26-228) on this result so that it now reflects the effects on both contra- and ipsilateral AL. We agree that it is better this
way as it makes that part of the results more visible, thank you for bringing it to our attention.

First paragraph on page 15 (Lines 306-308): you might want to mention that MGD density and MB volume can also decrease
when social insects live in confined conditions (reviewed in Groh and Meinertzhagen, Front Biosci 2:268-288, 2010). Thank
ou for bringing this fact and very nice paper to our attention. The whole subject of MGD is fascinating and there are
many aspects which could have affected the MGD of our samples, but as we did not measure MGD we did not want to
idetrack the discussion too much. Although Polygonia c-album is not a particularly social species it is still possible, and
erhaps even likely, that social interactions -or lack thereof- could affect their calycal MGD. However, we intentionally
wanted this section of the discussion to be quite brief as to not divert too much focus into MGD and instead allow more
oom for discussing the physical aspects we did measure.

Comments to the Author(s)
This study shows convincingly that the mechanisms underlying the growth of antennal lobes and mushroom bodies differ,
nd that olfactory input seems a main factor of AL development during early adulthood of the Comma butterfly. In my
pinion, there are a few points that should be addressed:
. Some aspects of the Methods section should be clarified or completed. For example, were the animals used for axonal
racing the same as those of the ‘baseline group’ in the second experiment? If not, how old were they? No, they were not the
ame animals as the tracing and olfactory blocking experiments were two separate experiments, but females from the
ame population and age were used in both experiments, which is now clarified.
n the Results and figures, the ‘baseline group’ is actually referred to as ‘newly eclosed’ animals: please use only one name
or this group throughout the manuscript. We used baseline throughout earlier versions of the manuscript and honestly just
missed to change it in the methods section, we have now changed it to newly eclosed and greatly appreciate that you
potted this mistake so we could fix it.
n that same experiment, it is said that the control group underwent no further treatment following immobilization, but it did
s it was exposed to the same olfactory context as the treated one. We agree that it is a bit confusing and have changed the
entence accordingly.
Finally, what was the delay between wax treatment and exposure to the olfactory context? The delay was minimal, just a few
minutes, we added a sentence stating this at the end of that paragraph.
. The sample size differs, within the ‘olfactory blockage’ group, for measurements of AL and MB volumes (18 and 20,
espectively), and as shown by the raw data, in some brains only the ALs were measured, and only the MBs in others
probably due to technical reasons). This might introduce a possible bias, as comparing the growth patterns of ALs and MBs
hould be based on measurements performed in the same brains. I suggest to exclude the brains whose analysis was
ncomplete from the dataset. You are right, we have removed all individuals of which we were not able to reconstruct both
ALs an calyces from the whole dataset, including two individuals from the control group where one only had
measurements from the AL and the other only from calyces.
. Olfactory blocking has a specific meaning in the field of behavioural studies (see e.g. Guerrieri et al 2005), so I
ecommend avoiding its use in the present study. I suggest ‘blockade of olfactory input’ or ‘olfactory blockade’ instead.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention and we have changed blocking to blockage in all of the appropriate places,
nd hope that this is a satisfying solution.
.80: It is not clear to me why the authors mention the calyx as the input region and the lobes as the main processing region –
he lobes are the main output region, and there is quite some processing occurring in the calyces, so unless I am missing
trong arguments to maintain this dichotomy, I’d rather oppose the calyx and lobes as input and output regions, rather than
nvolved or not in information processing. You are right, we now changed it to output region instead of main processing.
.277: what is a ‘neutral’ environment? Do you mean less complex? Comparatively poorer in terms of sensory stimuli? Please
larify. We do mean less complex/comparatively poorer in terms of olfactory stimuli, as those details are explained in the
ited paper, but also realize that we should be more precise here. The sentence is now changed so it instead reads “…had
arger calyces than females that were kept in an environment with a more neutral odour profile”. Thank you for bringing it
o our attention.
. 306-310: the ‘cognitive challenge’ in the cited studies was the establishment of an olfactory associative memory. In the
resent experiment, it is likely that butterflies have established such a memory as they were fed while smelling specific plant
dorants during several days, even if they were immobilized (which was actually the case in the bee study). Thus, the
ypothesis that MGD would not be affected in this experiment seems to lack strong support, while the opposite seems more
ikely. I suggest to modify that part of the manuscript accordingly.
We agree that we lack support that MGD would not be affected and we modified the text accordingly.
.316-317: why do the authors consider that the lack of AL expansion on the treated side indicate that expansion later in life is
nlikely? I fail to see the logic, here - although it is clear that in many insect species the first days or week of adult life is a
ritical period for experience-dependent neuropilar growth (see e.g. Groh & Meinertzhagen, 2010; Cabirol et al. 2017)
That is because we are talking about innate ontogenetic growth as opposed to growth triggered by sensory input. Our
easoning is that we find it unlikely that such growth would suddenly occur in females older than 7 days when it has been
bsent during the full first week after eclosion. As we stopped our measurements after 7 days we can of course not say
with certainty that no innate ontogenetic growth would occur in older adults, but we fail to see a likely scenario where this
would occur. If we were to reverse the blockade of olfactory input so that the antenna would start receiving olfactory
nput, however, we would expect growth to occur at any age. We would also expect ALs of untreated and fully functioning
ntennae to continue increasing in volume throughout the natural life of the butterfly, albeit probably at a slower pace in
lder butterflies.
However, we appreciate your comment and have changed the sentence as to state more clearly that we are referring to
nnate experience-independent ontogenetic growth.
