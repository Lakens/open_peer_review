The authors document an apparent hoverfly migration along the central California coast. This
would be the first such migration reported for the western US and thus important to include in
the literature. The paper is overall very well written. Below are a few minor issues and a
suggestion for an improvement.
Page 4, final line: you probably meant the West Coast, not East Coast.
Page 8, line 40: This sentence is awkwardly worded and on line 47 “where” should be “were”. It
would be helpful to state here that observed European hoverfly migrations include multiple
species, if that is true.
High numbers observed in 2017 could be due to good overwintering conditions, as described,
and it could also be related to specific weather patterns. It would be nice to compare weather
conditions on the days before the observed 2017 migration to those in 2018. Is there any evidence
of poor conditions at high altitudes that might have brought the hoverflies to ground? For
example, frontal passage or storms in the preceding day or two could have altered wind direction
aloft, and without those conditions in 2018 similar numbers would not have been observed at
ground level. Alternatively, storm conditions may have delayed and concentrated movement
leading to the 13 April observation. Historical weather data are available for specific locations
from Wunderground, and from NOAA.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
5
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry

This short manuscript provides evidence for a novel hoverfly migration. Both reviewers are of the
view that this represents an important insight to a data poor area. They provide a few minor
suggestions to further improve the manuscript.

Dear Dr Shepard,
We were pleased that both reviewers shared the view that our work represents an
important insight into a data poor area. We have addressed the minor suggestions of
reviewer 1 (see below) and I hope that you now find our manuscript ready for
publication.
Sincerely yours,

Page 4, final line: you probably meant the West Coast, not East Coast.
Correct. This has now been changed.
Page 8, line 40: This sentence is awkwardly worded and on line 47 “where” should
be “were”. It would be helpful to state here that observed European hoverfly
migrations include multiple species, if that is true.
We have changed this sentence to read:
“However, our evidence does not rule out the presence of multiple species, a
scenario that may be likely given the diversity of hoverflies found in North America,
the prevalence of migratory life histories within the family and the mix of species
often found during migrations in Europe.”
High numbers observed in 2017 could be due to good overwintering conditions, as
described, and it could also be related to specific weather patterns. It would be nice
to compare weather conditions on the days before the observed 2017 migration to
those in 2018. Is there any evidence of poor conditions at high altitudes that might
have brought the hoverflies to ground? For example, frontal passage or storms in the
preceding day or two could have altered wind direction aloft, and without those
conditions in 2018 similar numbers would not have been observed at ground level.
Alternatively, storm conditions may have delayed and concentrated movement
leading to the 20 April observation. Historical weather data are available for specific
locations from Wunderground, and from NOAA.
We thank reviewer 1 for their suggestion. We have used Wunderground and the US
Divisional Climate Data website (https://wrcc.dri.edu/spi/divplot2map.html) to check
weather data spanning the 2017 migration event.
We have updated our text to include this information in the relevant locations:
“For example, during the first part of 2017, Central Coast California saw the highest
rainfall since 1998 and warm spring temperatures (ESM file 5). Warmer spring
temperatures have been shown to increase the reproduction of overwintering insects
and to enhance the development and survival of their offspring (e.g. Ju et al. 2017
Scientific reports). In contrast, 2018 was a poorer year with a late spring and we
failed to observe migration in the same area, albeit only over a two-week window of
observation in April.”
and:
“In support of this, 18 April 2017 saw over 10 inches of rain in San Luis Obispo
County, followed by increasing temperatures and wind speeds leading up the
migration event two days later (ESM file 5). These meteorological conditions may
have served to delay and concentrate numbers, or alternatively, may have made
conditions aloft unfavourable.”
