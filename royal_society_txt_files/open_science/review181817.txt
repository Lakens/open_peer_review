This is a well-organized paper; the highlight of this work is that the reasonable coal pillar width
outside and under the road was quantitatively designed by Mark-Bieniawski formula and
FLAC3D numerical simulation. The remote control mining technology for the highwall residual
coal resources was proposed in this paper. It is a novel method for the exploitation of open-pit
mine, outcrop in hilly terrain and shallow depth coal seams in Chinese coal mines. Thus, I
recommend it to be published in Royal Society Open Science with some suggestion about
language that might further improve the clarity of the manuscript. Here are some of the details:
(1) The English needs further substantial editing. A native or more fluent English speaker familiar
with the material should be asked for help.
(2) below figure 4: 0.01 MPa intervals of 1000 steps.
Please, explain why you adopt this value, if this follows some norm for road or bridge design
rules?
(3) what are the safety conditions or the stability criteria that pillars have to satisfy? the plastic
3
zones are all decreased and plastic zone linking phenomenon do not appear either, which
deduces that both can keep the stability.
(4) Please clarify what is meant with instability as it is used through the whole document
In figure 8a, you say that the shrinkage reaches 16cm but from the figure it seems that this is not
true as the no blue contours are visible.
(5) The result of simulation indicates that the stability would be much better when the width of
pillar under the road and under the road outside is 1.3m and 1.7m respectively
again this seems wrong, according with figure 6 and 7 is exactly inverse.
(6) Section 3.2: The vertical stresses of coal seam inside and outside the road are 4.7 MPa and 4.3
MPa separately according to the equation 2 and the SBP is 12.24 MPa according to the equation 4,
which are all less than the corresponding strengths of coal pillar calculated according to the
equation 1 and close to the strength of coal pillar.

In the current manuscript, the pillar width in highwall mining and remote control of mining
equipment have been studied. A modelling based on FLAC3D was conducted to analyze the
pillar stability with different pillar width.
1. The English needs substantial editing. It is understandable and confusing. There are too many
grammar mistakes. A native or more fluent English speaker familiar with the material should be
asked for help.
2. It looks like a simple mixture of two parts, pillar width design and remote control. This
manuscript is more like an engineering report rather than a research study, especially for the part
of remote control.
3. Abstract:
4
¬ Novel?? It is really a simple and common mining method.
¬ A little wordy for the first sentence.
4. Part 1 “Introduction”:
¬ Poor. Because it does not consider many contributions in this field.
Actually, many researchers conducted various studies on pillar stability and highwall mining,
especially in USA .
5. Part 3
¬ The title of 3.1.1 are not good. There is no result in this part.
¬ Does Fig.3 fit your situation?
¬ In your modelling, you set the overlying strata of coal seam as interbed stratum, is that proper?
¬ The excavate width is also one of most important factor affecting the pillar stability, but we do
not see the number until Part 4. Why not study this factor?
¬ In my opinion, the pillar of 1.7 or 1.4 m may be a yield pillar. I do not think the modelling
results can reveal the true status.
¬ Do the formulas you selected fit your situation? As I know, some of them are developed for
yield pillar design, some of them are for barrier pillar.
6. Part 4
¬ The part of remote control looks like needless.
7. Part 5
¬ There is no data on pillar deformation or roadway shrinkage.
¬ As a research paper, this part is not a good expression for field application.
8. References: too many references in Chinese language.

This paper refers two key issues in highwall mining, pillar design and remote control. Numerical
modeling and Mark’s formula were used for pillar design. The remote control process was
introduced. The results provide a good case for highwall mining.
The following is a list of particular issues of concern:
1. page 2: “However, current studies rarely consider the effect of the roads on the highwall and
pillar design. The effect of the coal trucks on the road on the stability of coal pillars was also of
less consideration.”It is really better if this paper consider the effects of these two fators in pillar
design. But it still not clear in present paper how you consider the effects, especially in the
theoretical analysis.

Generally, Royal Society Open Science does not permit multiple rounds of revision; however,
given the positive views of two of the reviewers, an exception is being granted, as the authors
appear to be making 'good faith' efforts to improve their manuscript.
You are being given the opportunity to incorporate the changes recommended by the remaining
referee who has substantive comments. You MUST ensure that you meet their requirements, as
the revision will be returned to them to assess. If you do not satisfy this reviewer that the paper is
ready for publication, no further revisions will be entertained and the manuscript rejected.

paper aims at investigating the influence of mining parameters on stability of end-wall slopes in
ote control mining technology. The width of coal pillars is designed using numerical methods so that
stability of roof is guaranteed, moreover; the roadway layout is designed so that the recovery ratio
increased. Nonetheless, the authors are recommended to take into account the following notes
re publication.
<U+F0B7> Abstract-line 38: To analyze?
<U+F0B7> Line 47-page 3: TO is extra.
<U+F0B7> Line 3-page 4: This paper proposes?
<U+F0B7> Line 12-page 5: Does not?
<U+F0B7> Line 40-page 5: While the coal seam was adopted by strain softening?
<U+F0B7> Line 57-page 5: Parameters of all rocks?

Reviewer: 1
This paper aims at investigating the influence of mining parameters on stability of end-wall
slopes in remote control mining technology. The width of coal pillars is designed using
numerical methods so that the stability of roof is guaranteed, moreover; the roadway layout is
designed so that the recovery ratio has increased. Nonetheless, the authors are recommended to
take into account the following notes before publication.

Modifications: we are so sorry for our poor written, we have revised the above mistakes. Besides,

smooth the English of this paper aimed at the language problems. We are very sorry for more trouble
to you and special thanks to you for your good comments.
Line 40-page 5: While the coal seam was adopted by strain softening?
Modifications: The strain softening model can well match the uniaxial compression strength (UCS)
test of the laboratory test. The numerical model and the selected properties were calibrated through
comparison of the coal UCS test. It can be seen in following figure that a good agreement was
achieved between the numerical results and the laboratory test for both stress–strain curve and failure
mode of the sample. The maximum shear strain in the numerical model shows an X-shaped failure
mode of the sample, which was consistent with the laboratory test. Thus, we added this paragraph in
section 3.1.2 as
“In this model, the rock stratum is represented by Mohr-Coulomb model, the coal seam is described
by the strain softening model, and the physical and mechanical parameters of the coal and rock in the
model are listed in Table 1. The numerical model and selected properties were calibrated through
comparison of the coal uniaxial compressive strength test [26]. Figure 4 shows a good consistency
between the numerical results and the laboratory test for the stress–strain curve and failure mode of
the sample. The maximum shear strain in the numerical model shows an X-shaped failure mode of
the sample, which is consistent with the laboratory test.”

Line 43-page 6: It is more rational to use the term “plastic zone” rather than “plastic collapse”
Modifications: thank you for your good suggestion, the “plastic collapse” was revised as “plastic
zone”.
The optimal width of coal pillar could be expressed as a normalized parameter, as a ratio of
road cross section width, as an example, so that the outcome of this research can be used for
general cases.
Modifications: Thank you for your good suggestion, it must be recognized that we should extend our
strategy application. In order to prevent the overlying rock fall accidents, this paper uses
Mark-Bieniawski formula and FLAC3D numerical simulation to analyze the reasonable coal pillar
width outside and under the road. Thus, for other geological settings, it needs to perform the
numerical simulation again. This will reduce the applicability of the the outcome of our research. In
fact, the practice shows that the Mark-Bieniawski formula is the most suitable formula for the coal
pillar selection. But this method often has a large surplus coefficient and the effect of road’s dynamic
load is not considered. Thus, though the pillar width determination method in this paper can not be
directly applied to other geological conditions, but the pillar width of other geological conditions can
be also obtained by the method in this paper. Of course, we can use the numerical simulation to
obtain the reasonable width coal pillar with different road cross section width, pillar strength,
overburden strata thickness. So we can get a normalized empirical formula for the optimal width of
coal pillar. Thus, considering the reviewer’s good suggestions, we added a paragraph in section
3.2: as “The result shows that the width of the coal pillar obtained from the numerical simulation can
satisfy the support requirement and recover more resources. However, it also shows that the empirical
formulas have a large surplus coefficient, and the effect of the dynamic load of the road is not
considered. Thus, although the pillar width determination method in this paper cannot be directly
applied to other geological conditions, the pillar width of other geological conditions can be obtained
using the method in this paper. Moreover, the numerical simulation can be used to obtain the
reasonable width coal pillar with different road cross-section widths, pillar strengths, and overburden
strata thicknesses. Thus, we can obtain a normalized empirical formula for the optimal width of coal
pillars.”
Also we revised the Title of this paper as “Reasonable coal pillar design and remote control mining
technology for highwall residual coal resources”
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a well-organized paper; the highlight of this work is that the reasonable coal pillar width
outside and under the road was quantitatively designed by Mark-Bieniawski formula and
FLAC3D numerical simulation. The remote control mining technology for the highwall residual
coal resources was proposed in this paper. It is a novel method for the exploitation of open-pit
mine, outcrop in hilly terrain and shallow depth coal seams in Chinese coal mines. Thus, I
recommend it to be published in Royal Society Open Science with some suggestion about
language that might further improve the clarity of the manuscript. Here are some of the details:
(1) The English needs further substantial editing. A native or more fluent English speaker
familiar with the material should be asked for help.
Modifications: we have sought professional English editorial help to smooth the English of this
paper aimed at the language problems. We are very sorry for more trouble to you and special thanks
to you for your good comments.
(2) below figure 4: 0.01 MPa intervals of 1000 steps.
Please, explain why you adopt this value, if this follows some norm for road or bridge design
rules?
Modifications: It is really true as reviewer suggested that this sentence is not clear. 0.01 MPa refers
to the load of the coal trucks. The quality of a truck loaded with coal is about 50 t, and the bottom
area of a truck is about 50 m2, so the load applied on the road is 0.01 MPa. The intervals of 1000
steps mainly because the steps achieve dynamic balancing are about 1000.
In order to clarify this sentence, we added a sentence as ‘The load is assumed to be 0.01 MPa
intervals of 1000 steps, since the load of a truck loaded with coal is approximately 0.01 MPa, and the
dynamic balancing steps are 1000.’ behind this sentence.
(3) what are the safety conditions or the stability criteria that pillars have to satisfy? the plastic
zones are all decreased and plastic zone linking phenomenon do not appear either, which
deduces that both can keep the stability.
Modifications: It is really true as reviewer suggested that “safety conditions” is not clear. Mohr
coulomb failure criteria are used in our numerical model. The more the plastic zone in pillar means
the lower the bearing strength of the pillar. However, the plastic zone remain have the residual
strength to support together with the elastic zone, as shown in Figure.3(b). When the plastic zone
cut-through the pillar as shown in Figure.5(a) in the original manuscript, the plastic penetration area
doesn't have enough strength to support the roadway, as shown in Figure.3(c). Thus, safety conditions
of the pillar is that the plastic zones don’t cut-through the pillar, as shown in Figure.3(b), is the safety
conditions.
‘comparing the condition of 1.3m with 1.5m , the plastic zones are all decreased and plastic zone
linking phenomenon do not appear either, which deduces that both can keep the stability’ is revised as
‘comparing the condition of 1.0m, the plastic zones of 1.3 m and 1.5 m are all decreased and the
plastic penetration area does not appear either, which deduces that both can keep the stability’
In order to clarify the safety conditions in the revised paper, section 3.1.1 is used to illustrate the
reasonable width of coal pillar in this manuscript as follows:
3.1.1. Working status of the coal pillar
The working status of the coal pillar mainly includes three different situations, as shown in
Figure 3. Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria are used in the numerical model. A more plastic
zone in the pillar indicates a lower bearing strength of the pillar. However, the remaining
plastic zone has the residual strength to support the elastic zone, as shown in Figure 3(b).
When the plastic zone cuts through the pillar, the plastic penetration area does not have
sufficient strength to support the roadway, as shown in Figure 3(c). Thus, the safety
conditions of the pillar are that the plastic zones do not cut through the pillar. Figures 3(a, b)
satisfy the requirement. However, if the coal pillar width is too large as Figure 3(a) shows, it
will waste the resource and reduce the resource recovery. In general, the reasonable width of
coal pillar is shown in Figure 3(b): exploit as much coal resource as possible under the
safety condition of the pillars.

(4) Please clarify what is meant with instability as it is used through the whole document
In figure 8a, you say that the shrinkage reaches 16cm but from the figure it seems that this is not
true as the no blue contours are visible.
Modifications: The ‘instability’ in this paper means that the pillar beyond the reach of safety
conditions. As illustrate the “safety conditions” in the previous question, I think the instability in this
paper can also well explain.
In Figure 8a, the main shrinkage of the model is 12 cm. However, the maximal shrinkage did reaches
16cm, as shown in the following enlarged figure. The maximal shrinkage is located at the top of
roadway.
Figure 8(a) Vertical displacement of the road section with a pillar width of 1.4m
(5) The result of simulation indicates that the stability would be much better when the width of
pillar under the road and under the road outside is 1.3m and 1.7m respectively
again this seems wrong, according with figure 6 and 7 is exactly inverse.
Modifications: We are very sorry for our ambiguous expression. According to Figure 7, 8 and 9 in
revised paper, the stability would be much better when the width of pillar outside and under the road
is 1.5m and 2m, respectively. However, this status is the first status of the three pillars working status,
which has a best stability but wasting the resources. Thus, the reasonable width of coal pillar outside
and under the road is 1.3 m and 1.7 m, respectively.
In order to well illustrate this sentence, the revised sentence is “The simulation result indicates that
the reasonable widths of the pillar outside and under the road are 1.3 m and 1.7 m, respectively,
which can satisfy the requirement of mining safety and a high recovery ratio. Therefore, this
condition was considered the reasonable width of a coal pillar after comprehensive comparison.”
(6) Section 3.2: The vertical stresses of coal seam inside and outside the road are 4.7 MPa and
4.3 MPa separately according to the equation 2 and the SBP is 12.24 MPa according to the
equation 4, which are all less than the corresponding strengths of coal pillar calculated according
to the equation 1 and close to the strength of coal pillar.
Modifications: We are very sorry for our ambiguous expression. The main means of this sentence is
that the coal pillar used in this manuscript is not too large to the field application just like the first
status of the three working status. Thus, the rational calculation should be under the corresponding
strengths of coal pillar but not difference too much.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
In the current manuscript, the pillar width in highwall mining and remote control of mining
equipment have been studied. A modelling based on FLAC3D was conducted to analyze the
pillar stability with different pillar width.
1. The English needs substantial editing. It is understandable and confusing. There are too many
grammar mistakes. A native or more fluent English speaker familiar with the material should be
asked for help.
Modifications: We have sought professional English editorial help to smooth the English of this
paper aimed at the language problems. We are very sorry for more trouble to you and special thanks
to you for your good comments.
2. It looks like a simple mixture of two parts, pillar width design and remote control. This
manuscript is more like an engineering report rather than a research study, especially for the part
of remote control.
Modifications: Thank you for your good suggestion. It is really true as the reviewer’s comments that
the correlation between the pillar width design and remote control technology is not well expressed.
Highwall mining is a technique for attaining additional coal recovery after the economic strip limit is
reached in surface mining. It involves remote deployment of a continuous miner in openings beneath
the final highwall, with no personnel entry. Thus, the stability of coal pillars is the precondition for
safe implementation of remote control mining. Both of them constitute the highwall mining
technology. The remote control technology determines the main roadway layout of highwall
mining system. There is no need to the roadway by human, and the excavate width is determined
by the size of EBH132 cantilever excavator. Moreover, there is no permanent support in roadway.
Thus, the stability of overburden structure mainly depends on the stability of retained coal pillars.
In summary, remote control mining technology simplified mining system to achieve efficient mining
and reasonable pillar width ensures the safe mining and increases the recovery ratio.
In order to address this problem, we added a paragraph at the end of the section 2 as “The main
problem of the highwall mining technology is the layout of roadways. In this paper, remote
control technology is used, and the excavate width is determined by the size of the EBH132
cantilever excavator. There is no need to extract the roadway for human, which can simplify the
mining system to achieve efficient mining. However, there is no permanent support in the
roadway for the remote control mining. Thus, the stability of the overburden structure mainly
depends on the stability of the retained coal pillars, and a reasonable pillar width ensures the safe
mining and increases the recovery ratio. Thus, the reasonable coal pillar design and remote
control technology for the HWM technology were studied in this paper.”
3. Abstract:
Novel?? It is really a simple and common mining method.
A little wordy for the first sentence.
Modifications: It is really true as reviewer’s comment that highwall mining technology is a simple
and common mining method in the world. Considering the reviewer’s good suggestion we revised
the first sentence as “Highwall mining (HWM) technology is an efficient method for exploiting
residual coal resources in Chinese open-pit coal mines.”
4. Part 1 “Introduction”:
Poor. Because it does not consider many contributions in this field.
Actually, many researchers conducted various studies on pillar stability and highwall mining,
especially in USA .
Modifications: Highwall mining is a simple and common mining method in the world and we
revised the introduction of this part. Besides, we used English references, similar to original
Chinese references content, to replace part of Chinese references. For pillar stability studies of
highwall mining, we added a paragraph as:
A reasonable mining pillar for highwall mining is conducive to safe and efficient mining. The
highwall mining pillar design is a direct function of the coal strength, opening height, opening
width, and depth of cover. An elasto-plastic model suitable for the analysis of coal pillars has
been developed and implemented in both two- and three-dimensional finite element codes by
Fama et al. [20]. The use of the local mine stiffness concept can provide added confidence to a
highwall mining panel layout design [21]. Web and barrier pillar recommendations for
close-proximity multiple-seam highwall mining were studied by Mark [22, 23]. Perry et al. [24]
studied the effect of the highwall mining progression on the web and barrier pillar stability.
Using numerical modeling tools, a correction factor was suggested in the empirical pillar
strength equation for slender pillars with width-to-height ratios less than unity [25]. However,
current studies rarely consider the effect of the roads on the highwall and pillar design. The
effect of the coal trucks on the road on the stability of coal pillars was also of less consideration.
5. Part 3
¬ The title of 3.1.1 are not good. There is no result in this part.
¬ Does Fig.3 fit your situation?
Modifications: It is really true that there is no result in section 3.1.1. The purpose of this passage
is listing three working states of coal pillars. Thus, we revised the title of section 3.1.1 as
“Working status of the coal pillar”. Fig.3 shows the plastic zone with different coal pillar widths.
It is mainly for illustration the reasonable width of coal pillar and showing the stress distribution
in coal pillar. Considering the reviewer’s good suggestion, we revised the Fig.3 as follows:

Figure 3. The plastic zone with different coal pillar widths
¬ In your modelling, you set the overlying strata of coal seam as interbed stratum, is that proper?
Modifications: FLAC3D is simulation software based on finite difference method, so the whole
stratum is still continuous. The interbed stratum is used for parameter assignment of the strata
with different strength. We cleared it in the revised paper.
¬ The excavate width is also one of most important factor affecting the pillar stability, but we do
not see the number until Part 4. Why not study this factor?
Modifications: It is really true as as reviewer’s comment that the excavate width is also one of most
important factor affecting the pillar stability. Highwall mining pillar design is a direct function of coal
strength, opening height, opening width, and depth of cover. Depth of cover and opening height is
depending on geological conditions. Coal strength mainly depends on the strength of coal and the
width of coal pillar. Thus, the coal pillar width and opening width are the main factors affecting the
pillar stability. And in our situation, the excavate width is determined by the size of EBH132
cantilever excavator. And the total width of coal pillar width and opening width is fixed (5.5 m)
before the coal pillar width design. Thus, in the numerical simulation, the excavate width is
determined by the coal pillar width. The width of pillar under the road outside was simulated to be
1.0 m, 1.3 m and 1.5 m (the excavate width was simulated to be 4.5 m, 4.2 m and 4 m) and the width
of pillar under the road was simulated to be 1.4 m, 1.7 m and 2.0 m (the excavate width was
simulated to be 4.1 m, 3.8 m and 3.5 m), respectively. Considering the reviewer’s good comments, we
added the sentence in the section 3.1.2 as follows:
The pillar under the road outside was simulated to be 1.0 m, 1.3 m and 1.5 m wide, and the pillar
under the road was simulated to be 1.4 m, 1.7 m and 2.0 m wide, respectively. According to the
size of the residual coal and cantilever excavator, the width of each panel (sum of the pillar
width and excavate width) was set to 5.5 m. Thus, the excavation width under the road outside
was simulated to be 4.5 m, 4.2 m and 4 m, and the excavation width under the road was
simulated to be 4.1 m, 3.8 m and 3.5 m, respectively.
¬ In my opinion, the pillar of 1.7 or 1.4 m may be a yield pillar. I do not think the modelling
results can reveal the true status.
Modifications: The numerical model was used to back-analyze the uniaxial strength test of the coal
in the hope to find the parameter for yield pillar design. In order to improve the reliability of the
numerical model, the strain-softening pillar materials were meticulously calibrated. In this model, the
internal friction angle, cohesion and strength of extension will decrease with the strain increases. The
numerical model and the selected properties were calibrated through comparison of the coal UCS test.
It can be seen in following figure that a good agreement was achieved between the numerical results
and the laboratory test for both stress–strain curve and failure mode of the sample. The maximum
shear strain in the numerical model shows an X-shaped failure mode of the sample, which was
consistent with the laboratory test. Thus, we think the modelling results can reveal the true status.
Considering the reviewer’s good suggestion, we added this paragraph in section 3.1.2.
“In this model, the rock stratum is represented by Mohr-Coulomb model, the coal seam is described
by the strain softening model, and the physical and mechanical parameters of the coal and rock in the
model are listed in Table 1. The numerical model and selected properties were calibrated through
comparison of the coal uniaxial compressive strength test [26]. Figure 4 shows a good consistency
between the numerical results and the laboratory test for the stress–strain curve and failure mode of
the sample. The maximum shear strain in the numerical model shows an X-shaped failure mode of
the sample, which is consistent with the laboratory test.”

Pillar design is of paramount importance to any underground mine design. Oversized pillars may lead
to loss of coal while undersized pillars may lead to instability. In fact, the numerical results of the
pillar of 1.4 m show that the plastic zone spreads throughout the whole coal pillar. Thus, the coal
pillar is in yielding state, as shown in Figure 8 (a), the bearing capacity of coal pillar has
declined significantly, causing the shrinkage to reach 16cm, which is far more than the others.
When the width increases to 1.7m, the plastic zone is mainly distributed in the corners, but the
scope is relatively small and it does not spread throughout the whole pillar. The bearing capacity
can satisfy the requirement. Meanwhile, the maximum shrinkage is 4.8 cm in the cross section of
highway. Thus, it meets the engineering requirement.
Thus, the pillar of 1.4 m is a yield pillar (the third case in Figure 3), while the pillar of 1.7 m is
only part of the boundary area yielded (the second case in Figure 3), it can bear the load of
overlying strata.
¬ Do the formulas you selected fit your situation? As I know, some of them are developed for
yield pillar design, some of them are for barrier pillar.
Modifications: The width of yield pillar is the main research object in this paper. While
underground pillars are mostly square and rectangular, highwall mining pillars are long and
narrow, as they are formed after driving parallel entries in the seam from the highwall. These
pillars are termed as web pillars. Several empirical coal pillar strength equations developed for
rectangular pillars are still being used with some modifications to adapt to web pillars. However,
as to the rectangle pillar with large aspect ratio, the practice shows that the Mark-Bieniawski
formula is the most suitable formula for the yield pillar design. In order to clear this problem, we
added a sentence in Section 3.2 and added the relevant references.
6. Part 4
¬ The part of remote control looks like needless.
Modifications: the remote control is the part of highwall mining technology. This part can make
the structure of this case study more reasonable. Also we revised the Title of this paper as
“Reasonable coal pillar design and remote control mining technology for highwall residual coal
resources”
7. Part 5
¬ There is no data on pillar deformation or roadway shrinkage.
¬ As a research paper, this part is not a good expression for field application.
Modifications: It is really true as reviewer’s comment that this part is not a good expression for field
application. To further verify the stability of the selected coal pillars, the roadway section scanning
analyses should be carried out in the roadway under the road after highwall mining. The test method
was shown in the following figure. However, due to the HWM hole will be backfilled after highwall
mining (Fig.14f), it is impossible to put the equipment into the roadway for measurement. Therefore,
the deformation of roadways was not monitored in this paper. During the process of mining, there is
neither collapse of coal pillars nor roof caving accident, which demonstrates that the design width of
coal pillar is reasonable and the exploitation of the residual coal resource in the end–wall area is
efficient for open-pit coal mine.

original Chinese references content, to replace part of Chinese references. There are only three
Chinese references in the total 27 new references.

authors really appreciate your great kindness and good comments concerning our manuscript entitled “Reasonable

S-181817.R1). We are very grateful to the reviewer for his very useful suggestions on how to make statements well
ur paper. The revised paper has been rewritten and improved according to the suggestions of the reviewer. We hope
satisfied. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as following:
ponds to the reviewer’s comments:
iewer: 3
s paper refers two key issues in highwall mining, pillar design and remote control. Numerical modeling and
k’s formula were used for pillar design. The remote control process was introduced. The results provide a
d case for highwall mining.
following is a list of particular issues of concern:
page 2: “However, current studies rarely consider the effect of the roads on the highwall and pillar design.
effect of the coal trucks on the road on the stability of coal pillars was also of less consideration.” It is really
er if this paper consider the effects of these two fators in pillar design. But it still not clear in present paper
you consider the effects, especially in the theoretical analysis.
difications: It is really true as reviewer’s comments that the theoretical analysis were not consider the effect of the
s. In this paper, to analyze the effect of the coal trucks on the road on the stability of the coal pillars, a dynamic load
applied in the numerical simulation. The theoretical analysis was used to validate the numerical simulation results.
the result shows that the width of the coal pillar obtained from the numerical simulation can satisfy the support
irement and recover more resources. However, it also shows that the empirical formulas have a large surplus
ficient due to the effect of the dynamic load of the road are not considered. Thus, although the pillar width
rmination method in this paper cannot be directly applied to other geological conditions, the pillar width of other
ogical conditions can be obtained using the method in this paper. Moreover, the numerical simulation can be used
btain the reasonable width coal pillar with different road cross-section widths, pillar strengths, and overburden strata
knesses. Thus, we can obtain a normalized empirical formula for the optimal width of coal pillars by setting a safety
or according the numerical simulation.
rder to clear this problem, we added a discussion for the theoretical analysis at the end of the section as:

difications: Thank you for your good suggestion, we added the clarification in Section 3.1.2 as the coal seam is
ribed by the strain softening model, the cohesion and friction angle of the coal seam degrades as the plastic shear
n increases, and these factors are assigned the residual values when the plastic shear strain reaches 0.01, the

tic zone in Fig.7(b) is located in the core of pillar, while those in Fig. 7 (c) and Fig.8(b)/(c) are located only at
corners, why?
difications: In general, the corners of the pillar are the stress concentration area, the plastic zone priority occurs in
area. Thus, Fig. 7 (c) and Fig.8(b)/(c) are located only at the corners shows the bearing capacity can satisfy the
irement. While in Fig.7(b), after the corners of the pillar yielded, the plastic zone then occurred in the core of pillar,
due to the brittleness of coal, when the stress reaches a certain strength, tensile failure will occur in the middle part.
en the plastic zone spreads throughout the coal pillar, the ultimate bearing capacity will significantly decline and
e the coal pillar unstable. Thus, due to the plastic zone in Fig.7(b) were not developed throughout the coal pillar, it
maintain support strength. In order to clear this problem, we added a sentence in section 3.1.3.
As shown in Figure 7, when the coal pillar outside the highway is 1.0 m, the plastic zone has spread throughout the
re pillar, and the coal pillar collapses because of instability, which cannot satisfy the mining safety requirement;
paring the condition of 1.0 m, all plastic zones of 1.3 m and 1.5 m decreased. Due to the corners of the pillar are the
s concentration area, the plastic zone priority occurs in this area. Thus, Fig. 7 (c) located only at the corners shows
bearing capacity can satisfy the requirement. While in Fig.7(b), after the corners of the pillar yielded, the plastic
e then occurred in the core of pillar, it is due to the brittleness of coal, when the stress reaches a certain strength,
ile failure will occur in the middle part, but the plastic penetration area did not appear, so both zones maintained the
ility. Therefore, the width of the coal pillar under the road outside is 1.3 m due to the high resource recovery ratio.
Page 8, Please check the word “instability”, a little confusing.
difications: instability was revised as “unstability”
Page 8, The title of Part 3.2 may be better as empirical analysis. we do not see any theory in this part, except
e empirical formulas.

Page 8, Eqs.(2) to (4): This paper develops?
difications: The references were cited for Eqs.(2) to (4).
Pages 8 and 9, How can we get the value of in situ strength SI ? according to the mechanics experiment in
laboratory? Is that in-situ strength?
difications: According to the mechanics experiment in the laboratory, the value of in situ strength SI is calculated by
ollowing formula, which can be seen from the reference [27]:
<U+F03D> K / <U+F028> 36 <U+F029> ( H>0.9 m) or S I <U+F03D> K / <U+F028> H <U+F029> ( H<0.9 m)

re, sc is the uniaxial compressive strength of coal specimens tested in laboratory, MPa; D is the diameter or cube
dimension, m; H is the pillar height.
Part 4: This paper shows what the remote control system is, but as an academic paper, we need to know how
why you select these equipments, or the determination of the cutting path, and so on.
difications: The selection of the remote control mining equipment mainly according to the following reasons:
Based on the field geological conditions and coal reserves of the highwall coal seam;
Due to the existing mining equipment research and development status, and the equipment improvement capability
e supplier.
n consideration of the safe mining in the roadway without permanent support.
or the determination of the cutting path, the cutting sequence is from right to left and subsequently from the bottom
e upper position, because of the continuous and high-efficient working process, which has been extensively applied
he coal roadways excavation in the underground mines.
Part 5: More data or evidence of pillar stability, highwall stability…
difications: It is really true as reviewer’s comment that there is little data for evidence of pillar stability or
wall stability. To further verify the stability of the selected coal pillars, the roadway section scanning analyses
ld be carried out in the roadway under the road after highwall mining. The test method was shown in the following
re. However, due to the HWM hole will be backfilled after highwall mining (Fig.14f), it is impossible to put the
pment into the roadway for measurement. Therefore, the deformation of roadways was not monitored in this paper.
rder to prove the stability of coal pillar as far as possible, we can only monitor the deformation of the exposed
way section; the monitoring results are as follows. Within 15 months after mining, the maximum deformation of
way section is only 2.7 cm, which demonstrates that the design width of coal pillar is reasonable and the
oitation of the residual coal resource in the end–wall area is efficient for open-pit coal mine.
