Review note on RSOS-181456 “Advantages of social skills for contest resolution”
General comments
This is a well written and well-structured manuscript. The study has a good design, is clearly
presented and the conclusions reflects the results. I have some minor specific comments and
some questions related to the statistical analyses (see below).
Specific comments
Abstract
LN 22: It would help the reader if you add the age of the pigs at the contest.
LN 28: Write out what RHP stands for, this is the first time the reader meats this abbreviation.
Materials and methods
LN 110-111: Please specify which fear behaviors you refer to.
LN 121-129: Please clarify how the individuals were identified on the films (i.e. how they were
marked).
LN 131 and onwards: Statistical analyses:
• The treatments (SOC and CON) were allocated to sows (specified in line 84 and 85), thus the
analyses should be done on averages per litter (sow) and not on individual piglet level (as
sow/litter is the experimental unit).
• Specify which effects in the model are fixed and which are random.
• Even though the correct way to analyses this data is on litter/sow level and not piglet level. If
analyzed on piglet level (given that this is well justified in the statistical analyses section), the
random effect of litter(or sow if each sow only have one litter in the experiment) should be
included as a random effect in the model.
Results
Throughout the results section: Give one more decimal for SE than for the least square mean, now
you give the same number of decimals for both LSM and SE.

In this study, the authors test the effects of early life socialisation on contest dynamics and
intensity in pigs. They hypothesise that socialised pigs will be less aggressive than non-socialised
pigs due to an increased ability to assess their opponent. The authors find that socialised pigs are
indeed less aggressive during fights, being able to resolve conflict in a less costly manner than
non-socialised pigs. However, they find mixed evidence as to whether or not this is due to an
increased assessment ability.
Overall this is a neat study with interesting results. I have only minor comments for the authors
to consider before publication can be recommended.
INTRODUCTION
I found the structure of the introduction a little unusual, specifically with the hypothesis of the
study being presented in the second paragraph! However, all the information is there to set up
the study so unless the editor has a problem with this I think it’s OK albeit unconventional.
Line 42: Please define ‘aggressive intent’.
Line 75 and others: I think you need to be specific when you talk about ‘contest costs’.
Traditionally when examining assessment rules, one would inspect the relationship between
contestant RHP and contest duration (as a proxy of cost) but you also explore injury here (which
is very cool). I think it would be worthwhile for you to be explicit throughout the manuscript
when talking about costs to make it clear to the reader specifically which proxy of cost you are
referring to.
METHODS
Line 8: Why was the barrier replaced if the piglets were still able to mingle? Was this to prevent
aggression between the sows?
Line 91 and others: Be more specific about which animals. Say piglets or pigs depending on
which you are referring to.
Line 100: Are pigs still classed as piglets at 8 weeks old? Please specify.
Line 117: Were pre-fight lesions the result of play-fighting between siblings or were they only
present on SOC piglets? Did you look at the effect the presence of these pre-fight lesions had on
contest behaviour? Could be quite interesting to see if pigs with these lesions were more or less
aggressive regardless of socialisation treatment?
Line 125-126: Table 1 only gives a definition of ‘mutual fighting’ not ‘fighting’. I find the use of
fight to mean something different to contest very confusing throughout the manuscript and
recommend that you are explicit about the difference between these two terms when you first
being to use them. I also recommend that you are consistent with using ‘mutual fight’ rather than
4
just ‘fight’ to avoid confusion. It also might be worth writing a brief description of how a pig fight
plays out in this section so the reader understands all that comes next.
Line 138: Again be specific about what you mean when you say ‘contest costs’ here.
Line 150: What is ‘batch’?
RESULTS
Lines 191-192: “… shorter contest duration was therefore due to the accumulation of non-
significant time differences” – I don’t understand this sentence.

This study looked at whether socialization influences the aggressive behavior of pigs. The study
design is straightforward and the authors bring in tests from contest theory to see not only
whether overall levels of aggression differed but also whether the way that individuals assess one
another may depend on socialization. And indeed it seems that socialization affects both things,
and importantly reduces contest duration and costs, which has potentially very important
welfare implications. I found the study design and write-up very well done, and I only have a
few minor comments related to the interpretation of the data. It’s a bit difficult to tell what’s
going on here in terms of assessment, which the authors acknowledge, but I think the possibilities
are even broader than what they discuss.
Specific comments:
Line 72: Just to be clear here, is the hypothesis that socialized pigs should show mutual
assessment and other pigs should do something else (self assessment?)? Or rather that both types
should do mutual assessment, but socialized pigs do it better.
5
Line 185: Although Table 1 is cited above when the definition of fights is brought up, it would
probably help to alert the reader to the fact that all these other behaviors were also being
measured, sometime in the Methods section. This result on parallel walking comes as a surprise
otherwise because we wouldn’t have known that was looked at.
Line 191: Which “shorter contest duration” is being referred to here? Same comment for next
sentence.
Line 200: They were shorter contests, but presumably the fight is the most costly part of the
contest? If they’re both fighting equally often and for equal amounts of time, what does this say
about differences in aggression and assessment in these species? (granted, the trend for less biting
does of course suggest lower costs for socialized pigs)
Line 214: Would this strategy be based on absolute winner size, or winner size relative to loser
size? In the latter case, then wouldn’t you also expect a negative relationship between loser size
and contest duration? Did the larger pig always win?
Line 225: The results on overall contest duration are consistent with pigs being better at resolving
encounters, but it’s not clear if that’s because of improved assessment. Isn’t one interpretation of
the results that the individuals were actually doing a worse job of assessing one another,
assuming mutual assessment? That is, shouldn’t large socialized winners, if they were good
mutual assessors, been especially good at defeating their opponent, and shouldn’t small
socialized losers have been very good at giving up right away when facing a larger opponent?
Instead, large socialized winners seemed to take an especially long time to win for some reason,
which didn’t happen in the control group.

ss the editor has a problem with this I think it’s OK albeit unconventional.
42: Please define ‘aggressive intent’.

orthwhile for you to be explicit throughout the manuscript when talking about costs to make it clear
e reader specifically which proxy of cost you are referring to.
Response: done, throughout the manuscript contest cost has been specified when it was about a
specific measure. Also in line 121 added: ‘Skin lesions are injuries that are here assessed as a form
of contest cost.’ Using injury as contest cost is not new (e.g. Rudin & Briffa, 2011, Proc Roy Soc B)
but indeed not yet traditional.
HODS
8: Why was the barrier replaced if the piglets were still able to mingle? Was this to prevent
ession between the sows?
Response: indeed, although sows could not physically contact each other even without barrier, it
was placed to reduce stress in the sows from being in close eye contact to another. More details
on this and an image of the set-up were published in Camerlink et al. 2019 Animals.
91 and others: Be more specific about which animals. Say piglets or pigs depending on which you
eferring to.
Response: piglet refers to before weaning whereas pig refers to weaned animals. This has been
specified now in line 92 and ‘animals’ replaced by the type of pig.
100: Are pigs still classed as piglets at 8 weeks old? Please specify.
Response: no, clarified in line with above remark.
117: Were pre-fight lesions the result of play-fighting between siblings or were they only present on
piglets? Did you look at the effect the presence of these pre-fight lesions had on contest behaviour?
d be quite interesting to see if pigs with these lesions were more or less aggressive regardless of
alisation treatment?
Response: pre-contest lesions are present on both SOC and CON pigs (average CON 16.5 ± 1.06;
SOC 14.4 ± 0.88) and are more likely a result of minor aggression (single bites) than play fighting.
The frequency of play fighting in these pigs pre-weaning did not relate to skin lesions at 2 weeks
of age. Pre-test lesions are usually only used as correction for the number of fresh lesions. Here
they weakly correlated with lesions post contest (r = 0.29).
125-126: Table 1 only gives a definition of ‘mutual fighting’ not ‘fighting’. I find the use of fight to
n something different to contest very confusing throughout the manuscript and recommend that
are explicit about the difference between these two terms when you first being to use them. I also

might be worth writing a brief description of how a pig fight plays out in this section so the reader
erstands all that comes next.
Response: done, description added (line 129-133 new manuscript) and throughout the
manuscript ‘mutual fight’ has changed into ‘fight’ for ease of understanding (a fight is always
mutual in our definition).
138: Again be specific about what you mean when you say ‘contest costs’ here.
Response: done
150: What is ‘batch’?
Response: farrowing group (added to the text).

s 191-192: “… shorter contest duration was therefore due to the accumulation of non-significant
differences” – I don’t understand this sentence.
Response: revised to ‘The shorter contest duration was therefore due to the accumulation of
numerical but non-significant shorter durations spent on the various behaviours.’

study looked at whether socialization influences the aggressive behavior of pigs. The study design is
ghtforward and the authors bring in tests from contest theory to see not only whether overall levels
ggression differed but also whether the way that individuals assess one another may depend on
alization. And indeed it seems that socialization affects both things, and importantly reduces contest
tion and costs, which has potentially very important welfare implications. I found the study design
write-up very well done, and I only have a few minor comments related to the interpretation of the
. It’s a bit difficult to tell what’s going on here in terms of assessment, which the authors
owledge, but I think the possibilities are even broader than what they discuss.
ific comments:
72: Just to be clear here, is the hypothesis that socialized pigs should show mutual assessment and
r pigs should do something else (self assessment?)? Or rather that both types should do mutual
ssment, but socialized pigs do it better.
Response: both, sentence reworded. Pigs generally do not show mutual assessment (except for a
few), unless they gained fighting experience. Socialization (whereby they fight at early age) was
hypothesized to increase the number of pigs showing mutual assessment as well as the
proficiency herein.
185: Although Table 1 is cited above when the definition of fights is brought up, it would probably
to alert the reader to the fact that all these other behaviors were also being measured, sometime in
Methods section. This result on parallel walking comes as a surprise otherwise because we wouldn’t
known that was looked at.
Response: done. Line 129-133 in revised manuscript.
191: Which “shorter contest duration” is being referred to here? Same comment for next sentence.
Response: contest duration refers to the whole contest. The following has been added to the
methods for clarification: ‘Here, contest duration refers to the time from entering the arena until
leaving the arena (when a winner is apparent) whereas fight duration refers only to the exact
duration of the opponents being engaged in fighting.’
200: They were shorter contests, but presumably the fight is the most costly part of the contest? If
’re both fighting equally often and for equal amounts of time, what does this say about differences
gression and assessment in these species? (granted, the trend for less biting does of course suggest
r costs for socialized pigs)
Response: skin lesions reflect the in intensity of fighting. Thus although the fight duration did not
differ, the number of skin lesions indicates that the fights were less intense. For assessment the
display phase is more important, as they can then still ‘decide’ to not fight at all.
214: Would this strategy be based on absolute winner size, or winner size relative to loser size? In
atter case, then wouldn’t you also expect a negative relationship between loser size and contest
tion? Did the larger pig always win?
Response: here the models are based on absolute size of the winner and loser. In pigs, the largest
opponent is not always the winner but on average the winner is usually larger. In fact, in 37% of
contests the smaller opponent won and only in 47% the largest won (in 15% the winner and loser
had the same weight). This data has now been added in line 174-178 (1st paragraph Results) of
the revised manuscript and been mentioned in the Discussion.
225: The results on overall contest duration are consistent with pigs being better at resolving
unters, but it’s not clear if that’s because of improved assessment. Isn’t one interpretation of the
lts that the individuals were actually doing a worse job of assessing one another, assuming mutual
ssment? That is, shouldn’t large socialized winners, if they were good mutual assessors, been
cially good at defeating their opponent, and shouldn’t small socialized losers have been very good at
g up right away when facing a larger opponent? Instead, large socialized winners seemed to take an
cially long time to win for some reason, which didn’t happen in the control group.
Response: This points out exactly why injuries (skin lesions) are (at least for pigs) a better
measure of contest costs than the traditional measure of duration. For pigs it is more
advantageous to spent more time in display behaviour (non-damaging assessment of the
situation) to avoid costly and injurious fighting. Good assessors may therefore have a longer
contest duration but should have fewer injuries.
re 1: Y axis is log scale, but still not clear what the original units of time were.
Response: seconds, axis adjusted.
