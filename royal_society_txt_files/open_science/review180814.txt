The manuscript carries out a very detailed and organised presentation of the recent results in the
emerging field of Cu-CNT composite for electrical and thermal applications. The approaches
adopted and described cater to a applications ranging from micro-electronics to house-hold,
large-scale wiring. I have a few specific comments for the authors to consider for inclusion in the
discussion :-
1. While presence of oxygen and other metals provide greater interfacial contact between Cu and
CNTs, the overall properties are lower. Can we think of fabricating composites with CuO instead
of pure Cu and oxidised CNTs and then subsequently reducing the CuO to pure Cu? What are
the challenges in such an approach and have there been any precedents? Comments in this
direction should be pointed out.
2. Controlling the grain-structure is an important aspect that has been pointed out in the
manuscript. Here, a brief description of the kind of interface and grain-structure (for ex. bamboo
structure) that is expected to show higher electromigration resistance would enhance the
discussion.
3. Can the authors bring forth a processing route-property understanding to the article? This will
be significant to tailor the fabrication process to achieve the desired mechanical or thermal or
electrical properties. Although these 3 properties are correlated, several applications demand
exceptional performance (better than Cu) in a single aspect and not all three. From this
perpective, the authors can attempt deriving a relation between the processing route adopted and
the property desired.
Overall the manuscript is well-written and timely, considering the number of reports emerging in
this area. I would recommend the publication of this manuscript after these points are
considered.

This paper provides a nice and insightful review on the current status of Cu/CNT composites,
identifies various challenges faced by the R&D and industrialization, and points out possible
future directions for both the academia and industry. Overall, the manuscript was well written. I
have a few minor comments below.
1. Although the authors mentioned briefly the advantages of using Cu/CNT over using CNT on
Page 15, it may be helpful to add a few sentences in the Introduction stressing why Cu/CNT is
more promising than CNT alone and other composites (e.g., Al/CNT as mentioned in Line 28,
Page 13).
2. In Line 17-18, Page 4, the authors stated “lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and
therefore, better thermal stability than Cu”. In real applications, it is the CTE match between the
interconnect material and the substrate rather than the absolute value of the CTE that determines
the thermal stability of the system.
3. In Line 14, Page 13, the meaning of “small” seems to be ambiguous and contradict to the word
“long” in the same sentence. Does it mean “short” or “thin (single-walled)? Please clarify this.
4. In Sec. (b), Page 14, it may be helpful to add a few sentences explaining why the Cu grain size
can affect the material strength.
5. In Sec. (b), Page 14, although “structure” has been mentioned in the subtitle, no discussion on it
was found in the following context.
6. In Line 34, Page 14, it might not be very accurate to say that the “understanding on how Cu-
grain attributes influence various composite properties” is lacked, since the trend of the grain size
effect on composite strength has been identified and discussed on the same page.
7. In Line 25, Page 15, I assume “TIMs” is short for thermal interface materials instead of thermal
management materials.

VIEWER COMMENT: The manuscript carries out a very detailed and organised
sentation of the recent results in the emerging field of Cu-CNT composite for electrical
thermal applications. The approaches adopted and described cater to a applications
ging from micro-electronics to house-hold, large-scale wiring. I have a few specific
ments for the authors to consider for inclusion in the discussion :-
THOR REPLY: Many thanks for reviewing our manuscript and for the constructive comments and
estions. We have considered and attempted to include recommendations you have proposed. We
e our revisions are sufficient for our manuscript’s acceptance for publication.
VIEWER COMMENT: 1. While presence of oxygen and other metals provide greater
rfacial contact between Cu and CNTs, the overall properties are lower.
we think of fabricating composites with CuO instead of pure Cu and oxidised CNTs
then subsequently reducing the CuO to pure Cu?
at are the challenges in such an approach and have there been any precedents?
mments in this direction should be pointed out.
THOR REPLY: Many thanks for the comment and suggestions. Our answer is in three parts in
onse to each sentence of the reviewer’s comment.
VIEWER COMMENT part 1: Can we think of fabricating composites with CuO instead
ure Cu and oxidised CNTs and then subsequently reducing the CuO to pure Cu? Have
re been any precedents?
THOR REPLY part 1: There are many precedents for fabricating Cu/CNT composites by
ucing CuO/CNT composites. All molecularly mixed composites are made this way. First,
O/CNT is made and then reduced to Cu/CNT. We have clarified this as below in section 3.1.
nuscript text: Section 3.1, Page 4
ovel molecular-level mixing method was developed to enhance CNT-Cu interaction (Fig. 3)
37-45). In this method, suspensions of CNTs with anionic functional groups are mixed with
+ salt solutions, which encourages electrostatic interaction between the two entities (rather
merely physical adhesion). The CNT/copper salt solutions are dried and calcined to make
per-oxide/CNT composite particles, which are then reduced usually by H2-annealing to CNT-
edded Cu nanocomposite powders. These nanocomposite powders are then compacted by
(37,40,42) or isostatic pressing and thermal sintering (41).
VIEWER COMMENT part 2: While presence of oxygen and other metals provide
ater interfacial contact between Cu and CNTs, the overall properties are lower.
THOR REPLY part 2: We agree with the point raised by the reviewer on trade-off between
perties, especially in composites incorporating interfacial oxygen. We have clarified this in
ion 4.1.2 (text furnished below). Here, we give an example of the trade-off for molecular
ed composites where oxygen inclusion leads to strength-increase accompanied by thermal
ductivity-decrease. We also point to the cause for thermal conductivity-decrease as CNT
ce damage caused by covalent nanotube functionalization during composite fabrication. To
id CNT damage, we propose the use of alternative milder covalent and non-covalent CNT
ctionalization methods.
nuscript text: Section 4.1.2, Page 13
ome cases, additives are seen to show a trade-off between properties, improving one set of
perties (usually mechanical), while degrading others (thermal and electrical). For example, in
posites prepared by molecular mixing, oxygen inclusion degrades Cu/CNT thermal
ductivity, while improving strength (90). The poor thermal conductivity is attributed to
on lattice damage at the CNT-Cu interface caused by nanotube functionalization applied for
rfacial oxygen inclusion during Cu/CNT fabrication. To harness and understand the benefits
nterfacial oxygen on composite properties, the negative effects of nanocarbon lattice damage
d to be decoupled and suppressed. Toward this, we recommend exploring interfacial oxygen
usion using alternative milder covalent and non-covalent CNT functionalization methods.
VIEWER COMMENT part 3: What are the challenges in such an approach (“of
ricating composites with CuO instead of pure Cu and oxidised CNTs and then
sequently reducing the CuO to pure Cu”) and have there been any precedents?
THOR REPLY part 3: We add a precedent for composite fabrication by molecular mixing
olving reduction of [CuO/non-covalently functionalized CNTs] that shows no property trade-
Mendoza et al.’s composites (41) obtained by molecular mixing using surfactant-wrapped
CNTs show an increase in both mechanical and electrical properties [42% increase in
dness and 3 x higher electrical conductivity at 80 K vs. Cu]. However, in their study, the
nt of oxygen inclusion at the interface is unclear as the elemental composition of the
O/CNT interface is not explicitly characterized.
general, characterization data on Cu-additive-CNT interface are limited and studies
rmining the amount of additive and type of Cu-additive-CNT bond-type required to
imize property trade-off in composites are absent. An additional issue is the lack of
ication methods to control the amount, position, and type of the Cu-additive-CNT bonds. We
e flagged these issues as challenges to be addressed by the Cu/CNT community.
altered version of the text is presented below.
nuscript text: Section 4.1.2, Page 13
a precedent, Mendoza et al.’s composites (41) fabricated by molecular mixing using non-
alently functionalized (surfactant-wrapped) SWCNTs show an increase in both mechanical
dness) and electrical properties (conductivity) without trade-off. However, in their study, the
nt of oxygen inclusion at the interface is unclear as the elemental composition of the Cu-O-
T interface is not explicitly characterized. In general, there is a lacuna of sufficient
racterization data on Cu-additive-CNT interfaces. Also, studies determining the amount of
itive and type of Cu-additive-CNT bond-type required to minimize property trade-off in
posites are absent. Additional efforts need to be devoted toward rigorously characterizing the
T-additive-Cu interface and identifying interface structures and compositions capable of
ancing Cu/CNT performances without trade-offs.
ides sufficient CNT-Cu interface characterization, research efforts are also required to
lore fabrication routes to control the amount, bonding-type, and location of interfacial
ancers in composites. In terms of location of interfacial enhancers, Milowska et al. (71)
gest that carbide-forming metal additives are to be included at CNT-ends rather than on
walls to increase electrical properties. Current processing strategies are insufficient to
ieve additive inclusion with such atomic level precision. Also, studies similar to Milowska et
on the effect of additive element’s position on thermal and mechanical performances are
essary.
VIEWER COMMENT: 2. Controlling the grain-structure is an important aspect that
been pointed out in the manuscript. Here, a brief description of the kind of interface
grain-structure (for ex. bamboo structure) that is expected to show higher
tromigration resistance would enhance the discussion.
THOR REPLY part 1: Many thanks for the suggestion. We have already pointed out examples
iterature that report on current stability and Cu electromigration reliability in Cu/CNT
ction 3.2, copy of the text furnished below). Calculations indicate that CNTs increase Cu
usion activation energy in the composites, resulting in electromigration suppression.
nuscript text: Section 3.2, Page 8 (Line 1)
ctrodeposited Cu/CNT have demonstrated current stabilities > Cu in both micro (3) and
roscopic structures (55,61). Cu/CNT microlines with CCCs 100 times that of Cu (3) have
n reported (Fig. 4E), while macrosheets (55) and wires (61) with 36% and 28% increase in
C vs. Cu, respectively have been demonstrated. In terms of lifetime, Chai et al. (50) show a 5-
increase in lifetime for vertical Cu/CNT via-interconnects vs. Cu. Recently, Subramaniam et
58) confirmed lifetime increase in planar multitier Cu/CNT interconnects compared to Cu.
improved Cu/CNT CCC and lifetime (vs. Cu) are attributed to nanotubes suppressing Cu
tromigration (movement of Cu along electric current) by increasing Cu diffusion activation
rgy (3).
THOR REPLY part 2: As the reviewer points out, tailoring Cu microstructure in composites
ld improve electromigration resistance. Specifically, bamboo microstructures with grain
ndaries normal to current flow are promising candidates. In pure Cu interconnects, Cu
ace diffusion is the dominant factor and microstructure does not significantly affect
tromigration resistance (reference I). Cu microstructure is anticipated to become an
ortant factor determining electromigration resistance when Cu surface diffusion is retarded.
wever, bamboo microstructures do improve electromigration resistance in pure Cu
rconnects when interconnect widths become comparable to the grain sizes (i.e., in the sub-
ron range) (reference II). In this light, in Cu/CNT where Cu diffusion is already retarded by
otubes, bamboo-like Cu-matrix nano/microstructures could lead to marked improvements in
tromigration resistance. We have added a brief discussion on this in section 4.1.3 (b). A copy
rnished below.
sociated references: Hau-Riege, Microelectronics Reliability 2004, 44, pg. 195–205
et al. in International Interconnect Technology Conference 2007 IEEE pp. 93-95)]
nuscript text: Section 4.1.3 (b), Page 15 (last paragraph)
oring Cu-matrix nano/microstructures may also be vital for improving Cu/CNT current
ility and electromigration reliability for interconnect applications as Cu diffusion is already
rained by nanotubes in the composites. Composites with Cu-grain boundaries tailored
pendicular to current flow (i.e., bamboo micro/nanostructures) may show higher
tromigration lifetimes and reliabilities than randomly oriented polygranular
ro/nanostructures, especially in downsized configurations. While the merit of tailored
ro/nanostructures has been demonstrated for pure Cu interconnects, similar studies for
CNT interconnects are necessary.
VIEWER COMMENT: 3. Can the authors bring forth a processing route-property
erstanding to the article? This will be significant to tailor the fabrication process to
ieve the desired mechanical or thermal or electrical properties. Although these 3
perties are correlated, several applications demand exceptional performance (better
n Cu) in a single aspect and not all three. From this perpective, the authors can attempt
iving a relation between the processing route adopted and the property desired.
THOR REPLY: We thank the author for this insight. We agree that most applications require
ormances superior to Cu not in all three aspects (thermal, electrical, and mechanical) but one or few
cts. However, based on the current Cu/CNT literature, it is difficult to provide processing route-
erty correlations and hence, general directions on which processing route is better to achieve which
erty/type of property (electrical, thermal, or mechanical). This is mainly because of the absence of
icient data for the different properties by the various processing routes to make a fair comparison and
ide a processing route choice-property strategy. For instance, data on major properties like
perature coefficient of resistivity, current carrying capacity, thermal conductivity, hardness, etc. for
two major processing routes (powder processing and electrodeposition) considered in this paper are
nt. As an example, we provide the current literature data available for hardness (figure below, not
uded in the manuscript). It can be seen that there are too few data points for electrodeposited
posites to allow for a fair comparison to decide which route is better to fabricate composites of higher
ness.
ther cases (such as mechanical strength), there are no significant differences between the two
essing routes (graph provided below for tensile strength, not included in the manuscript).
t said, we do observe certain property trends for the two major processing routes (powder processing
electrodeposition) in the current literature. We have already pointed out these trends at various
tures in the manuscript in sections 3.1 and 3.2 and in Fig. 4.
(1) Currently, Cu/CNT significantly lighter than Cu i.e., with significantly higher CNT vol% are
produced by electrodeposition techniques rather than powder-processing.
(2) Composites with superior thermal stability (CTE) and specific electrical conductivity are
produced by electrodeposition than powder processing: somewhat as a consequence of the higher
CNT vol%.
believe obtaining process-property correlation will be best achieved by elucidating process-structure-
erty trends because it is the Cu/CNT micro/nanostructures that ultimately dictate composite
ormance. We have provided directions and offered strategies to clarify Cu/CNT structure-property
ds in the light of the Cu-matrix, CNTs, and the Cu/CNT interface for the two major fabrication routes
ughout section 4.1.
lly, we believe industry norms will be the real determinant of the processing route for fabricating
posites for real-world use. Hence, we have provided our perspectives on the choice of processing
es for specific applications based on current industry production standards in section 4.2.

VIEWER COMMENT: This paper provides a nice and insightful review on the current
us of Cu/CNT composites, identifies various challenges faced by the R&D and
ustrialization, and points out possible future directions for both the academia and
ustry. Overall, the manuscript was well written. I have a few minor comments below.
THOR REPLY: Many thanks for the constructive comments and suggestions. We have considered
attempted to include the recommendations proposed.
VIEWER COMMENT: 1. Although the authors mentioned briefly the advantages of
g Cu/CNT over using CNT on Page 15, it may be helpful to add a few sentences in the
oduction stressing why Cu/CNT is more promising than CNT alone and other
posites (e.g., Al/CNT as mentioned in Line 28, Page 13).
THOR REPLY: Thanks for the suggestion. We have included text on why Cu/CNT is more
mising on neat CNT materials and other metal-matrix/CNT composites like Al/CNT in the
oduction. The added text is provided below.
nuscript text: Section 2, Page 2 (last paragraph)
T macromaterials and other metal-matrix/CNT composites (e.g., Al/CNT) are additionally
lored prospective Cu-alternatives besides Cu/CNT. However, these materials are unlikely to
ch the promise of Cu/CNT, specifically in applications requiring high electrical
ductivities. Individual CNTs are nanoscopic and too small for practical application, although
surpass copper performances. More practically useful macromaterials composed of CNT
mblies have been fabricated but their performances are inadequate. For instance, CNT
romaterial electrical conductivities are still at least an order of magnitude lower than that of
per, limiting their practical application. In addition, CNT macromaterials also present issues
h regard to integration into existing electrical and electronics systems. Standard joining
hods (soldering, crimping, etc.) are inapplicable to the purely carbon-based nanotube
mblies. Among metal-matrix/CNT composites prevalently researched, Al/CNT composites
pete closely with Cu/CNT as Al is lighter and cheaper than copper. However, by itself,
minium has a lower melting point and higher propensity for oxidation than copper, rendering
based composites more promising, especially for applications requiring thermal stability.
VIEWER COMMENT: 2. In Line 17-18, Page 4, the authors stated “lower coefficient of
rmal expansion (CTE) and therefore, better thermal stability than Cu”. In real
lications, it is the CTE match between the interconnect material and the substrate
her than the absolute value of the CTE that determines the thermal stability of the
em.
THOR REPLY: We agree that the matching of CTE of the interconnect and substrate rather
the absolute value of CTE determines the system’s thermal stability. We have clarified this
ltering the text as below.
nuscript text: Section 3.1, Page 4
lecular-level mixed composites also show a lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) (of
ppm) than Cu (17 ppm) (40) and a lower mismatch with Si CTE (of 3-5 ppm). This
cates the Cu/CNT’s potential as a better interconnect material than copper for electronics
h higher thermal stabilities. The lower CTE mismatch with Si (the usual substrate in
tronics) is critical for interconnect materials to avoid their thermal expansion-driven
mination from the chip.
VIEWER COMMENT: 3. In Line 14, Page 13, the meaning of “small” seems to be
biguous and contradict to the word “long” in the same sentence. Does it mean “short” or
in (single-walled)? Please clarify this.
THOR REPLY: Apologies for causing confusion. We meant small-diameter CNTs. We have
replaced the word “small” with “small-diameter”.
nuscript text: Section 4.1.3 (a), Page 14
iminary results in the current literature give a general idea that small-diameter, few-walled,
e, long, and oriented CNTs may probably be beneficial for composite performances.
VIEWER COMMENT: 4. In Sec. (b), Page 14, it may be helpful to add a few sentences
laining why the Cu grain size can affect the material strength.
THOR REPLY: Many thanks for the suggestion. We have now included the discussion on why
grain size affects material strength as below in section 4.1.3.
nuscript text: Section 4.1.3 (b), Page 15
ilar to conventional metals and alloys, Cu/CNT shows yield strength increase with decrease
rain size (grain refinement) in accordance with the Hall-Petch relationship. For instance, Kim
l. (113) demonstrate 27% increase in composite yield strength with drop in Cu grain size
m 4 µm to 1.5 µm. This strengthening achieved by grain refinement is attributed to increased
ber of grain boundaries that pin dislocations, impede their motion and propagation, delaying
material’s deformation and failure.
VIEWER COMMENT: 5. In Sec. (b), Page 14, although “structure” has been mentioned
he subtitle, no discussion on it was found in the following context.
THOR REPLY part 1: Many thanks for the comment. We have altered the sub-section title of
3 (b) to “Effects and control of Cu-matrix attributes in composites” (Manuscript, Section
3 (b), Page 15)
THOR REPLY part 2: We apologize for the inadequate discussion on the effects of Cu-matrix
ro/nanostructures on composite performances. Unfortunately, there are nearly no studies in
current literature on composites with micro/nanostructure-controlled Cu-matrices and its
ct on Cu/CNT properties. We flag this as a challenge to be addressed by the research
munity.
ther, we have now added two examples in pure Cu literature that can be borrowed and
nded to Cu/CNT to harness Cu-matrix micro/nanostructure tailoring for improving overall
ormances.
first example is on exploiting Cu-matrix micro/nanostructure tailoring to circumvent Cu
n refinement-driven trade-off between mechanical properties (which increase) and
trical/thermal performances (which decrease). In pure copper, this has been achieved by
oducing Cu micro/nanostructures with coherent twin boundaries. (Associated reference: Lu et
cience 2004, 304, pg. 422-426)
second example is on tailoring Cu-matrix structure for electromigration reliability (for
rconnect applications) by introducing bamboo-type micro/nanostructures with grain
ndaries perpendicular to the current flow.
sociated reference: Hau-Riege, Microelectronics Reliability 2004, 44, pg. 195–205
et al. in International Interconnect Technology Conference 2007 IEEE pp. 93-95)
nuscript text: (Manuscript, Section 4.1.3 (b), Page 15)
ilst being a positive influence on mechanical properties, grain refinement is disadvantageous
composite electrical and thermal performances. Smaller grains i.e., larger number of grain
ndaries implies increased electron and phonon scattering at grain boundaries. Consequently,
-grained composites have shown deteriorated electrical and thermal conductivities
60,117). It is however possible to minimize this trade-off by micro/nanostructure tailoring,
ch has been demonstrated for pure copper. Lu et al. achieved nanocrystalline pure copper
ples with ultrahigh strength and high electrical conductivity by introducing a nanostructure
sisting of multiple coherent twin boundaries. Similar efforts to determine Cu-grain size and
cture regimes aimed at minimizing trade-off between electrical/thermal and mechanical
perties resulting from grain refinement are necessary for Cu/CNT.
oring Cu-matrix nano/microstructures may also be vital for improving Cu/CNT current
ility and electromigration reliability for interconnect applications as Cu diffusion is already
rained by nanotubes in the composites (3). Composites with Cu-grain boundaries tailored
pendicular to current flow (i.e., bamboo micro/nanostructures) may show higher
tromigration lifetimes and reliabilities than randomly oriented polygranular
ro/nanostructures, especially in downsized configurations. While the merit of tailored
ro/nanostructures has been demonstrated for pure Cu interconnects, similar studies for
CNT interconnects are necessary.
VIEWER COMMENT: 6. In Line 34, Page 14, it might not be very accurate to say that
“understanding on how Cu-grain attributes influence various composite properties” is
ed, since the trend of the grain size effect on composite strength has been identified and
ussed on the same page.
THOR REPLY part 1: This sentence was intended to imply that a complete understanding of
Cu-grain attributes influence various composite properties is still lacking. To clarify, we
e altered the text as below.
nuscript text: Manuscript, Section 4.1.3 (b), Page 16
main issues in regulating Cu-matrix attributes to maximize overall composite performances
be summarized below.
lack of complete understanding on how Cu-matrix attributes influence various composite
perties and
lack of methods to control Cu-matrix attributes.
THOR REPLY part 2: Although some effort has been devoted to understand the grain attribute
cts on composite performance, much of the literature focuses on how grain size affects
nly mechanical properties. In the case of electrical and thermal properties, only conductivities
dealt with (and only in a few studies). Other important aspects of understanding are still
ing. One example is there are hardly any studies on how grain size affects CTE, TCR, and
C. We have discussed this and other specific unknows on the effect of Cu-matrix grain size
micro/nanostructures in the subsequent paragraph.
nuscript text: Manuscript, Section 4.1.3 (b), Page 16, line 6
erms of gaining understanding, the shortage of data on Cu-matrix attributes (especially size
micro/nanostructure) vs. electrical/thermal properties needs to be addressed. Specifically,
ies on CTE, CCC, and TCR vs. Cu grain size and micro/nanostructure are missing an
uiredd. Further, in the extant literature, grain-size effects have always been intertwined with
T vol% and agglomeration effects. Therefore, exclusive studies on grain-size effects on
tron and phonon transport are needed in homogeneous composites. On a related note,
posite performance related to Cu-grain sizes are more widely reported for low CNT vol%
ples, usually obtained by powder processing. Analogous studies are essential for high CNT
% composites, especially those obtained by electrodeposition.
VIEWER COMMENT: 7. In Line 25, Page 15, I assume “TIMs” is short for thermal
rface materials instead of thermal management materials.
THOR REPLY: Yes, we made a mistake with defining the acronym TIM (thermal interface
erial). This is now corrected.
nuscript text: Manuscript, Section 4.1.3 (b), Page 16
h-end electronics demand special interconnects, thermal interface materials (TIMs) with heat
current stabilities > Cu and electrical and thermal conductivities at par with Cu.
