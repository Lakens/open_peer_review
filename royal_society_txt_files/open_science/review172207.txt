Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This is an interesting and well written paper with good data on the outcome of interactions
between African wolves and Ethiopian wolves. I find the basic results interesting and important,
and with some relatively simple revisions I think that this would be a valuable contribution to
our understanding of these species. The number of individuals sampled is rather small, but for
these species that is an almost unavoidable problem. I do think that the inferences might be
tempered slightly by consideration that the results are perhaps somewhat dependent on the
configuration of a relatively small number of individual home ranges, but that does not alter my
positive view of the paper as a whole.
My suggestions are as follows:
1. A suggestion about the decision to fit two models to these interactions, one for AW and one for
EW.
With only two species involved, a win for one species is necessarily a loss for the other, so the
dependent variable is identical for both analyses, just recoded to flip the 1/0 coding for wins and
losses. If all the independent variables were truly independent, the effect of site (core vs. buffer)
would produce the same coefficient, standard error and Wald test for the two analyses, but with
the sign reversed. This is not the case (as shown in Table 1: aside, I assume that these coefficients
and standard errors are on the log-odds scale, but this should be stated explicitly). The reported
difference between the species in the effect of site suggests that collinearity between group size
and site is affecting the inferences. Given the strength of the site effect as shown in Figure 1, I
doubt this issue has any important effect on the primary inferences about competitive differences
in the core and buffer, but it might have an appreciable effect on the inferences about group size.
To help resolve this, I would suggest running a single model with the existing terms (site and
group size), but adding terms for species and the interaction between site and species (which
would replicate the intent of the two models fit in the present manuscript) and an interaction
term for group size and site. Comparing the site x species interaction effects to the current model,
while controlling for any site x group size interaction, might help to resolve why the effect of site
is not the same for the two species as it logically should be with two levels for species and two
levels for site.
2. A comment on the distribution of locations, particularly for AW.
Figure 1 shows two very obvious clusters of AW locations, i.e., there appears to be something at
work beyond just ‘buffer’ in determining the distribution. This should be discussed. Are those
locations with resource patches? (The next comment is related.)
3. A comment on the number of individuals observed and the implicit assumption that each
interaction is an independent event.
The degrees of freedom for error in the test for site effects implicitly assumes that each
interaction between AW and EW was an independent event, but these data represent repeated
samples from a small number of individuals, and thus it is likely that pseudo-replication causes
the P-values to be too small. To avoid pseudo-replication, the model should include a random
effect of identity (of EW-AW pairs, if a single model is fit as suggested above). It also seems
plausible that these individuals have a history of interaction and know one another individually.
At a minimum, the manuscript could discuss the issue that the configuration of a relatively small
number of individual home ranges could affect inferences about the core-buffer effect on AW-EW
interactions (if individual identity was not recorded for these interactions).
3
4. It seems expected that group size would have a stronger effect on the probability of winning
for AW, because they are smaller. Perhaps note that this is a general pattern for interactions
among carnivores. E.g., prior studies show that the outcome of competitive interactions between
wild dogs and spotted hyenas [or other packs of wild dogs] depends on group size [and
particularly on the relative sizes of the groups in an interaction]).
5. Please report the means and standard errors with the z test on line 179 for the data on
abundance of mole rats in the buffer and core. Failure to detect a difference can be due to a small
effect size or due to imprecise estimates, so readers will want to see the effect size and precision
in the main text.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this paper, interactions between Ethiopian and African wolves are analyzed. In the context of
the diets of these species, the authors consider the nature of the interactions and relationships
between their outcomes and body size, group size, and habitat. I believe that this paper makes a
valuable contribution to the study of these species and their interactions. In addition, the work
has significant relevance to the conservation of Ethiopian wolves – a critically endangered
species. I have listed minor comments below:
- It seems like the last cited reference in the paper is [18]. If they are not currently cited,
references [19-22] should either be removed or cited appropriately.
- Some of the model output is a bit sparse. For example, p-values could be added to the results in
Table 4. Although less important, random effect information could optionally be included as
well. (Things like the estimate/p-value associated with the random effect variance parameter
and the estimated effect sizes for each of the trapping locations.)
- Perhaps I’ve missed something, but the decision to model fraction of won encounters separately
4
for African and Ethiopian wolves (as shown in Table 1) seems a little peculiar. If (members of)
one species won an encounter, then the other most have lost it. So, why not fit a single model
with AW wins versus EW wins as the binary response? Sizes of both groups could be included
as covariates. Anyway, a brief explanation of the rationale behind the modeling approach could
be of interest to some readers.
- The authors may wish to consider noting the statistical software used to fit, at least, the mixed
model(s). For example, something like “the ‘glmer’ function in the ‘lme4’ R package.” This could
make the results easier to replicate since there are a number of ways to fit generalized linear
mixed models. Alternatively, the authors could provide relevant code, if applicable.
- In Table S2, it might be better to label “Mole rat pressene” as “Core area” (like in Table 4), if
appropriate. The caption could then be used to make it clear that the model is for the likelihood
of mole rat presence (i.e. “presence” is coded as 1 and “absence” as 0).
- Line 90 (I refer to the inner line numbers): Not sure "both" is needed. Also, “Conservation”
should probably be “Conservation Area”
- Line 91: “with estimated of 21” should be something like “with an estimated 21”
- Line 131: “1181 traps” should be something like “1181 traps in core area”
- Line 145: “were selected randomly checked” perhaps should be something like “were randomly
selected to be”
- Lines 146-148: “abundance” should probably be “abundances,” “linear” should be “linear
mixed” for clarity, “which” should be “with.” Also, here, it appears that there is just a single
model and response variable, so these terms should not be plural. If multiple models were fit for
this part, this could be made clearer.

As before, I find this paper interesting and useful, and the primary inference convincing.
However, I am concerned that confusion about the appropriate glm remains a problem. The
response letter states that (fitting a single model for both species, as suggested) the interaction
between species and site was not a significant effect on the outcome of competition, and thus it
was dropped from the model. It seems obvious from Figure 3 that this statement is not correct.
Indeed, the primary inference of the paper is that site affects which species wins.
The coefficients reported in Table 1 also do not make sense for a single model fit to both species.
There would not be separate intercepts; the effect of species would be a single coefficient
describing the difference in mean winning rate for one species relative to the other, and the effect
of interest would be the coefficient for the interaction between species and site.

This is an interesting and well written paper with good data on the outcome of interactions between
African wolves and Ethiopian wolves. I find the basic results interesting and important, and with some
relatively simple revisions I think that this would be a valuable contribution to our understanding of
these species. The number of individuals sampled is rather small, but for these species that is an almost
unavoidable problem. I do think that the inferences might be tempered slightly by consideration that the
results are perhaps somewhat dependent on the configuration of a relatively small number of individual
home ranges, but that does not alter my positive view of the paper as a whole.
My suggestions are as follows:
1. A suggestion about the decision to fit two models to these interactions, one for AW and one for EW.
With only two species involved, a win for one species is necessarily a loss for the other, so the
dependent variable is identical for both analyses, just recoded to flip the 1/0 coding for wins and losses.
If all the independent variables were truly independent, the effect of site (core vs. buffer) would produce
the same coefficient, standard error and Wald test for the two analyses, but with the sign reversed. This
is not the case (as shown in Table 1: aside, I assume that these coefficients and standard errors are on
the log-odds scale, but this should be stated explicitly). The reported difference between the species in
the effect of site suggests that collinearity between group size and site is affecting the inferences. Given
the strength of the site effect as shown in Figure 1, I doubt this issue has any important effect on the
primary inferences about competitive differences in the core and buffer, but it might have an appreciable
effect on the inferences about group size.
To help resolve this, I would suggest running a single model with the existing terms (site and group
size), but adding terms for species and the interaction between site and species (which would replicate
the intent of the two models fit in the present manuscript) and an interaction term for group size and
site. Comparing the site x species interaction effects to the current model, while controlling for any site x
group size interaction, might help to resolve why the effect of site is not the same for the two species as
it logically should be with two levels for species and two levels for site.
Our reply: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have incorporated a new single analysis in the
new version of our manuscript (see methods and results; Table 1) in which the probability of the African
wolf or Ethiopian wolf winning the encounter was used as the response variable. We note that the
interaction between site and species appeared was not significant, so we excluded it from the analysis.
2. A comment on the distribution of locations, particularly for AW.
Figure 1 shows two very obvious clusters of AW locations, i.e., there appears to be something at work
beyond just ‘buffer’ in determining the distribution. This should be discussed. Are those locations with
resource patches? (The next comment is related.)
Our reply: We assumed that the reviewer is referencing figure 2 here. This is simply because our
collared animals are from two packs lived together in these particular corners. Between these two
populations, there were two other groups with individuals of 4 and 5 individuals respectively between
these populations during the time we collared African wolves. We collared two individuals, one from each
of the groups (AW530, AW600, See Figure below). Unfortunately both of them died shortly. One was
killed by the locals and we recovered the collar. The second individual was simply disappeared. We
believe the local killed the animal and destroy the collar. In the first case, we got the collar from one of
the local’s house, and the local people already learned we could easily track the collar, and it is likely
that they break the collar.

3. A comment on the number of individuals observed and the implicit assumption that each interaction is
an independent event.
The degrees of freedom for error in the test for site effects implicitly assumes that each interaction
between AW and EW was an independent event, but these data represent repeated samples from a
small number of individuals, and thus it is likely that pseudo-replication causes the P-values to be too
small. To avoid pseudo-replication, the model should include a random effect of identity (of EW-AW
pairs, if a single model is fit as suggested above). It also seems plausible that these individuals have a
history of interaction and know one another individually. At a minimum, the manuscript could discuss
the issue that the configuration of a relatively small number of individual home ranges could affect
inferences about the core-buffer effect on AW-EW interactions (if individual identity was not recorded for
these interactions).
Our reply: We strongly agree with this comment. African wolf are naturally in small numbers and
individual identification for those involved in all observed interaction was also difficult. We have now
make this clear in the method section that we do not individually identify animals involved in the
interaction on line 114: “We were unable to determine the identity of individual wolves. Given the low
population sizes of both EWs and AWs and the fact that both species exhibit territoriality, it is virtually
certain that repeated sampling of the same individuals occurred.” While there are methodologies that
might allow us to determine the influence the potential effects of repeated sampling on the results (for
example, Venkataraman et al 2015 J Mammal used a resampling approach to account for
pseudoreplication on a behavioral study of the Ethiopian wolf), the strength of the territoriality effects in
this study suggest that the results would not change.
4. It seems expected that group size would have a stronger effect on the probability of winning for AW,
because they are smaller. Perhaps note that this is a general pattern for interactions among carnivores.
E.g., prior studies show that the outcome of competitive interactions between wild dogs and spotted
hyenas [or other packs of wild dogs] depends on group size [and particularly on the relative sizes of the
groups in an interaction]).
Our reply: This is true, and we have now mentioned the importance of group size on carnivore
interspecific competition in the Discussion, line 193 and 194.
5. Please report the means and standard errors with the z test on line 179 for the data on abundance of
mole rats in the buffer and core. Failure to detect a difference can be due to a small effect size or due to
imprecise estimates, so readers will want to see the effect size and precision in the main text.
Our reply: We have now included the mean, sd and number of plots assessed for mole rat holes in each
of the localities on line 180 and 181.

Comments to the Author(s)

In this paper, interactions between Ethiopian and African wolves are analyzed. In the context of the
diets of these species, the authors consider the nature of the interactions and relationships between
their outcomes and body size, group size, and habitat. I believe that this paper makes a valuable
contribution to the study of these species and their interactions. In addition, the work has significant
relevance to the conservation of Ethiopian wolves – a critically endangered species. I have listed minor
comments below:
- It seems like the last cited reference in the paper is [18]. If they are not currently cited, references
[19-22] should either be removed or cited appropriately.
Our reply: We have cited the references.
- Some of the model output is a bit sparse. For example, p-values could be added to the results in Table
4. Although less important, random effect information could optionally be included as well. (Things like
the estimate/p-value associated with the random effect variance parameter and the estimated effect
sizes for each of the trapping locations.)
Our reply: We have now included the P values where appropriate, see table 4.
- Perhaps I’ve missed something, but the decision to model fraction of won encounters separately for
African and Ethiopian wolves (as shown in Table 1) seems a little peculiar. If (members of) one species
won an encounter, then the other most have lost it. So, why not fit a single model with AW wins versus
EW wins as the binary response? Sizes of both groups could be included as covariates. Anyway, a brief
explanation of the rationale behind the modeling approach could be of interest to some readers.
Our reply: We fully agreed with this comment, and we have now performed a single analysis in which
the probability of a victory by the Ethiopian wolf or African wolf is modeled as the response variable, see
table 1.
- The authors may wish to consider noting the statistical software used to fit, at least, the mixed
model(s). For example, something like “the ‘glmer’ function in the ‘lme4’ R package.” This could make
the results easier to replicate since there are a number of ways to fit generalized linear mixed models.
Alternatively, the authors could provide relevant code, if applicable.
Our reply: We now mentioned the function we used in the analysis as follow
- Shannon’s Diversity indices (H) of rodent species between the core and buffer zones were compared by
fitting a generalized linear mixed effects model using the lmer function in the lme4 package.
- We used binomial logistic regression to analyse the outcome of winning the agonistic interaction
(response variable: won vs. lost) in relation to the two sites (categorical explanatory variable: buffer vs.
core) separately for AW and EW using the glm function.
- In Table S2, it might be better to label “Mole rat presence” as “Core area” (like in Table 4), if
appropriate. The caption could then be used to make it clear that the model is for the likelihood of mole
rat presence (i.e. “presence” is coded as 1 and “absence” as 0).
Our reply: We have now made the changes as recommended
- Line 90 (I refer to the inner line numbers): Not sure "both" is needed. Also, “Conservation” should
probably be “Conservation Area”
Our reply: We have now made the changes as recommended
- Line 91: “with estimated of 21” should be something like “with an estimated 21”
Our reply: We have now made the changes
- Line 131: “1181 traps” should be something like “1181 traps in core area”
Our reply: We have now made the changes as recommended
- Line 145: “were selected randomly checked” perhaps should be something like “were randomly
selected to be”
Our reply: We have now made the changes as recommended
- Lines 146-148: “abundance” should probably be “abundances,” “linear” should be “linear mixed” for
clarity, “which” should be “with.” Also, here, it appears that there is just a single model and response
variable, so these terms should not be plural. If multiple models were fit for this part, this could be
made clearer.
Our reply: We have now made the changes as recommend

Dear Editor,
Thank you very much for the good news and for forwarding the reviewers’ comments. The problem
raised by reviewer 1 arises, because by mistake, we uploaded the old version of the respective table and
not our revised version. we have now corrected our mistake in the revised version.
Reply for comment by Reviewer 1
Thank you for pointing again to this problem, and that is right. As you clearly demonstrated, site is most
important factor that determine the outcome of the AW-EW interactions (shown in table 1 and fig 3). We
followed your constructive comment of single analysis of the Ethiopian wolf-African wolf interaction
outcomes in relation to habitat and group size in our previous revision as well. Unfortunately however
we did not upload a revised version of Table 1. We have now included the updated version of the
analysis (see table 1).
