In this submitted manuscript, the authors described the preparation of ionic liquid-modified
MCM-41-polymer mixed matrix membrane for butanol pervaporation. They characterized the
formed membranes in detail and studied their performance on butanol pervaporation. Some
useful results were contained in this manuscript. In my opinion, this manuscript could be

1. The contents of the two ionic liquids in MCM-41 should be determined by elemental analysis
because the XPS method was inaccurate.
2. The authors said that “the ionic liquids could be effectively coupled with MCM-41 through
hydrogen bonds and the nucleophilic reaction between anions of the ionic liquid and silanized

Comments to the Author(s)
In this submitted manuscript, the authors described the preparation of ionic liquid-
modified MCM-41-polymer mixed matrix membrane for butanol pervaporation. They
characterized the formed membranes in detail and studied their performance on
butanol pervaporation. Some useful results were contained in this manuscript. In my
opinion, this manuscript could be accepted after some modifications.
1. The contents of the two ionic liquids in MCM-41 should be determined by
elemental analysis because the XPS method was inaccurate.
Response:Thank you for your suggestion. Ionic liquid modified MCM-41 is a solid
sample. It’s difficult to measure the contents of ionic liquids in a solid sample
accurately. In revision, we also characterized the ionic liquid modified MCM-41 with
EDS (energy dispersive spectrometry). The EDS data was listed in Table C1. Although
the two sets of data have some differences due to the detecting depth of XPS and EDS
are different. The detecting depth of EDS is about several micrometers, which is much
higher than the detecting depth of XPS. Both of the elementary composition results
indicated that there was fluorine (characteristic element of the ionic liquids IL1 and
IL2) in the modified MCM-41, which meant that ionic liquid was incorporated with
MCM-41 effectively.

MCM-41-IL2 21.6 1.0 56.0 19.9 0.1 1.4
2. The authors said that “the ionic liquids could be effectively coupled with MCM-41
through hydrogen bonds and the nucleophilic reaction between anions of the
ionic liquid and silanized MCM-41.” Was there any evidence for the the
nucleophilic reaction between anions of the ionic liquid and silanized MCM-41?
Or how the reaction occurred?
Response:Figure 1 shows the preparation routes of ionic liquid modified MCM-41.
MCM-41 was first been silanized by 3-chloropropyltriethoxysilane. Because the anion
[Tf2N]- of the two ionic liquids is a good nucleophile. According to reference [31, 32],
the anion [Tf2N]- of the two ionic liquids used in our research is a good nucleophile, it
can react with the silanized MCM-41 (nucleophilic substitution). On the other hand,
ionic liquids can also be coupled with MCM-41 by hydrogen bond. XPS characterization
verified that ionic liquid coupled with MCM-41 effectively.

3. TEM of the prepared IL-modified MCM-41 should be conducted. Meanwhile, the
used membrane should also be characterized.
Response:Thank you for your suggestion. We have characterized MCM-41 and ionic
liquid modified MCM-41 with TEM. And the TEM images are listed in Figure 2 d), e), f).
The mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and ionic liquid modified MCM-41 can be seen
in the TEM images. And after modification, the pore size decreased slightly.

In membrane field, the stability of the membrane is usually tested by longtime process.
In this research, we conducted a 100 h pervaporation experiment with the mixed
matrix membrane. Figure 12 indicated MCM-41-IL-PEBA membrane was of good
stability. We characterized the used MCM-41-IL PEBA membranes (after 100 h of
pervaporation) by SEM (Figure C1). The surface of the used ionic liquid modified
membrane changed little. The IL modified MCM-41 is still incorporated with the
polymer PEBA effectively.

4. The results of the prepared membrane for butanol pervaporation should be
compared with some reported results of the similar materials.
Response:Thank you for your suggestion. The results of the prepared membrane for
butanol pervaporation have been compared with some reported results of other
membranes (Table 3). Under the similar experimental conditions, MCM-41-IL-PEBA
membranes showed good pervaporation performance. Pervaporation separation
index (PSI) of 10289 g/m2<U+F0D7>h was obtained by using the 5%MCM-41-IL2-PEBA
membrane, which was quite high compared with other membranes.

5. Some reasonable explanations should be provided for the different performance
of the two ILs modified materials.
Response:Thank you for your suggestion. According to the research for butanol
extraction by Ha et al [26], the butanol/water selectivity strongly depends on the
hydrophobicity of anions of ILs followed by the hydrophobicity of cations of ILs. [Tf2N]-
based ionic liquids showed best extraction efficiency for butanol recovery in their
research. And the hydrophobicity of cations would increase as the cation alkyl chain
length increases. Both IL1 and IL2 are [Tf2N]- based ionic liquids with high
hydrophobicity, therefore the separation factor of butanol/water could be enhanced
when IL-modified MCM-41 was used to fill the membrane. IL2 performed better in
selective butanol pervaporation because it has longer alkyl chain length in its cation.
The pervaporation performance of these membranes was also consistent with the
swelling experiment and water contact angle measurement results.

6. The results of the non-modified MCM-41 for butanol pervaporation should be
provided.
Response:Thank you for your suggestion. The result of the non-modified MCM-41
for butanol pervaporation was compared with MCM-41-IL1-PEBA and MCM-41-IL2-
PEBA membrane in Figure 10 c). Since MCM-41 has abundant hydrophilic –OH, the
hydrophilicity of 5%MCM-41-PEBA membrane was increased. Therefore its
separation factor of butanol/water was a little lower than that of the pristine PEBA
membrane. On the other hand, the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 facilitated
butanol and water diffusion in the membrane, for which the permeation flux of the
5%MCM-41-PEBA membrane was significantly improved. The incorporation of IL-
modified MCM-41 is beneficial to the enhancement of separation factor and
permeation flux.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting study that reports the used of ILs as effective fillers for the
fabrication of mixed matrix membranes. The as-obtained membranes exhibit
interesting butanol pervaporation performance. Membrane-based separations are
becoming more and more important and attractive. The materials including MCM-
hybrids and membranes reported in this manuscript are well characterized and
reasonable membrane separation experiments are performed. Overall, this
manuscript is well organized and could be published after revisions.
1) BET characterization and pore size distribution should provided along with N2-
adsorption curves. The authors should exhibit these adsorption-desorption curves,
not just list data in a table.
Response:Thank you for your suggestion. N2 adsorption-desorption curves are listed
in Figure 2. Figure 2 and Table 2 showed that after IL modification, MCM-41-IL1 and
MCM-41-IL2 can keep the mesoporous structure. The pore volume and pore size of
the IL-modified MCM-41 decreased a little.

2) What is the purity of these two ionic liquids used in this manuscript? Please
provide NMR data. As the authors comment that they are hydrophobic. Please
show their contact angel experiments and results. Furthermore, do ILs contain any
water? Will water affect the membrane-based separation performance?
Response:The ionic liquids were produced by the Shanghai Cheng Jie Chemical Co.
LTD. The purity of these two ionic liquids used in this manuscript is higher than 99%.
The water content in these two ionic liquids is very low (< 1000 ppm). We have
characterized the ionic liquids with NMR. The NMR data of these two ionic liquids are
listed as the following:

We also measured the water contact angle of pristine PEBA membrane (77<U+F0B0>), 5%
MCM-41-PEBA membrane (65<U+F0B0>), 5% MCM-41-IL1-PEBA membrane (85<U+F0B0>) and 5%
MCM-41-IL2-PEBA membrane (88<U+F0B0>). Since molecular sieve MCM-41 has abundant
hydrophilic –OH, the water contact angle of the 5% MCM-41-PEBA membrane
decreased to 65<U+F0B0>, which meant that the hydrophilicity of 5% MCM-41-PEBA
membrane was increased. With the incorporation of ionic liquid modified MCM-41,
the water contact angles of 5%MCM-41-IL1-PEBA membrane and 5%MCM-41-IL2-
PEBA membrane increased to 85<U+F0B0> and 88<U+F0B0> respectively, which meant that the
membranes hydrophobicity was enhanced. Due to IL2 has longer alkyl chain length in
its cation, the hydrophobicity of 5%MCM-41-IL2-PEBA membrane was higher than that
of 5%MCM-41-IL1-PEBA membrane.

3) It seems that the authors just load each IL with a certain amount. Did the authors
systematically study the IL effect? For example, did the author load more ILs into
MCM-41 to get more ILs incorporated into the matrix of MCM-41? The effect of ILs
on the butanol pervaporation should be explored.
Response:It’s very difficult to accurately measure the ionic content in the mixed matrix
membrane. In this manuscript, we did not load more ILs into MCM-41. We have
compared the performance of the mixed matrix membranes with different content of
ionic liquid modified MCM-41. And the pervaporation experiment data showed that
the incorporation of IL1 or IL2 modified MCM-41 is beneficial to butanol separation.
4) What is the mechanism for the enhanced membrane-based separation
performance? The authors should perform more experiments and get more better
understanding.
Response:MCM-41 is a kind of mesoporous molecular sieve. After IL modification,
MCM-41-IL1 and MCM-41-IL2 still retained mesoporous structure. The mesoporous
structure of molecular sieve facilitated butanol and water diffusion in the membrane,
for which the permeation flux of the modified membrane was significantly improved.
According to the research for butanol extraction by Ha et al [26], the butanol/water
selectivity strongly depends on the hydrophobicity of anions of ILs followed by the
hydrophobicity of cations of ILs. [Tf2N]- based ionic liquids showed best extraction
efficiency for butanol recovery in their research. And the hydrophobicity of cations
would increase as the cation alkyl chain length increases. IL2 performed better in
selective butanol pervaporation because it has longer alkyl chain length in its cation.
We also measured the water contact angle of pristine PEBA membrane, 5% MCM-
41-PEBA membrane, 5% MCM-41-IL1-PEBA membrane and 5% MCM-41-IL2-PEBA
membrane. The water contact angle of pristine PEBA membrane was 77<U+F0B0>. Because
MCM-41 has abundant hydrophilic –OH, the hydrophilicity of 5% MCM-41-PEBA
membrane was increased (its contact angle decreased to 65<U+F0B0>). However, the contact
angles of 5% MCM-41-IL1-PEBA membrane and 5% MCM-41-IL2-PEBA membrane
increased to 85<U+F0B0> and 88<U+F0B0> respectively (5% MCM-41-IL2-PEBA membrane was more
hydrophobic). The pervaporation performance of these membranes was consistent
with the water contact angle measurement results.
