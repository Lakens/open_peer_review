Effect of lignin structure on adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) formation was investigated by
authors. Vanillyl alcohol (VA) and veratryl alcohol (VE) were selected for the phenolic and non-
phenolic lignin model compounds, respectively. It has practical and scientific significance in
elucidating the reaction pathway of lignin with ClO2 and therefore reducing chlorinated
pollutants. I believe the manuscript can be accepted after the following minor revisions.
2. Introduction. “The chemical structure of lignin is complex, and the lignin macromolecules have
a great variety of bonds”. Why were phenolic lignin model compound and non-phenolic lignin
model compound selected to study?
3.2. Experiments. “Then, the respective lignin model compound was transferred to the chlorine
dioxide solution and reacted at 70 °C with magnetic stirring”. How many rpm? Please explain the
experiment more clearly.
4.1. Effect of reaction time on AOX formation. “This is in agreement with the conclusions of C.
Bogatu, who found that the oxidation of phenolic compounds with chlorine dioxide in water
solutions contains a very fast step”. Please insert references.
4.1. Effect of reaction time on AOX formation. “AOX was also formed rapidly at the beginning of
the reaction when VE reacted with chlorine dioxide, reaching 1036 mg•L-1 after 10 minutes”.
Please revise the time unit of the manuscript.
5. Conclusion. “The AOX content produced by the reaction of VE with chlorine dioxide solution
is higher than that of VA with chlorine dioxide solution, although the consumption of VE is
smaller than that of VA”. The author needs further explanation in “Results and Discussion”.

The adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) mainly comes from the reaction of residual lignin and
chlorinated bleaching agent during bleaching. The application of lignin model compound in
pulping is helpful to understand the reaction mechanism of lignin and chlorine dioxide from the
molecular level. The pathway to AOX formation by the lignin model compound and chlorine
dioxide was speculated, which will provide a theoretical basis for reducing the formation of
AOX. I believe the manuscript can be accepted after minor revision. Some specific points are
showed below.
2. Introduction. “Many studies have focused on the degradation of lignin model compounds”.
What is the difference between this study and previous study.
3.2. Experiments. “The reaction mixture was stored in a refrigerator and analyzed as soon as
possible”. How to ensure the reaction did not continue.
3.4. HPLC Analysis. “using a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile-water (10/90) (vol) and 0.1%
acetic acid, a <U+FB02>ow rate of 0.3 mL·min-1, a temperature of 50 °C, and UV detection at 280 nm”. If
there are some references, please insert them.
4.1. Effect of reaction time on AOX formation. “Each individual reaction was performed in a
solution with an initial AOX content of 6.2 mmol and concentration of 124 mmol·L-1”. Please
verify if “AOX content” should be “lignin model compound”.
4.1. Effect of reaction time on AOX formation. “The AOX content increased within 10 minutes
and ultimately reached 1224 mg·L-1”. Please revise the time unit of the manuscript.
4.2. Concentration of lignin model compounds. “The AOX content formed by the reaction of VE
with chlorine dioxide solution was 60.9 mg·L-1 creating a total concentration of 12.4 mmol·L-1,
which is slightly higher than that formed by VA with chlorine dioxide solution (55.4 mg·L-1)”.
The author needs further explanation in this result.
4.2. Concentration of lignin model compounds. “The total AOX content of the separate reaction is
less than that of combined reaction of VA and VE with chlorine dioxide solution at the same total

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Reviewer,
Thank you for your letter and for the comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Effect of lignin structure on AOX formation in
chlorine dioxide bleaching”. We have studied your comments
carefully and have made corrections which we hope could meet your
requirements. All changes have been highlighted in the revised version
(red highlighting).
Questions you put forward are explained as follows:
Reviewer #1:
2. Introduction. “The chemical structure of lignin is
complex, and the lignin macromolecules have a great
variety of bonds”. Why were phenolic lignin model
compound and non-phenolic lignin model compound
selected to study?
Phenolic hydroxyl group is an important functional group of
lignin structure. Lignin can be divided into phenolic lignin and
non-phenolic lignin in term of phenolic hydroxyl group. The
phenolic hydroxyl groups can influence the main types of
reaction and the reactivity of lignin structures in chemical
reaction. Therefore, the influence of phenolic and non-phenolic
lignin model compounds on AOX formation was studied.
3.2. Experiments. “Then, the respective lignin model
compound was transferred to the chlorine dioxide solution
and reacted at 70 °C with magnetic stirring”. How many
rpm? Please explain the experiment more clearly.
The rpm of magnetic stirring was 150. It has been described
more clearly in the revised manuscript.
4.1. Effect of reaction time on AOX formation. “This is in
agreement with the conclusions of C. Bogatu, who found
that the oxidation of phenolic compounds with chlorine
dioxide in water solutions contains a very fast step”. Please
insert references.
The reference was added to the revised version.
4.1. Effect of reaction time on AOX formation. “AOX was
also formed rapidly at the beginning of the reaction when
VE reacted with chlorine dioxide, reaching 1036 mg•L-1
after 10 minutes”. Please revise the time unit of the
manuscript.
The units of time have been modified in the revised version.
5. Conclusion. “The AOX content produced by the reaction
of VE with chlorine dioxide solution is higher than that of
VA with chlorine dioxide solution, although the
consumption of VE is smaller than that of VA”. The author
needs further explanation in “Results and Discussion”.
Under the condition of excessive lignin model, less VE was
consumed by quantitative chlorine dioxide. This is due to the
low reactivity of non-phenolic lignin. The complete reaction of
VE requires more chlorine dioxide than VA. VA containing
phenolic structure has higher reactivity. Phenolic hydroxyl
groups were converted into free radicals for it was easily
attacked by chlorine dioxide. And then the oxidation fracture of
the benzene ring. Most free radicals are further oxidized by
chlorine dioxide to form chlorolipids. It was further
decomposed into muconic acid, ortho-quinone, para-quinone
and oxacyclopropane structures for its unstable structure.
Oxidative fracture of aromatic structures was the main reaction
of VA in chlorine dioxide solution. Therefore, the lower
content of AOX was generated from VA. VE has lower
reactivity due to the absence of phenolic hydroxyl group. The
hydroxymethyl side chain was easier oxidized by chlorine
dioxide. Then chlorine substitution was occured on the
aromatic-ring. More content of AOX was generated at a lower
reaction rate. It has been explained more clearly in the revised
version.
Reviewer #2:
2. Introduction. “Many studies have focused on the
degradation of lignin model compounds”. What is the
difference between this study and previous study.
Previous study mainly focused on the changes of structure and
degradation pathway of lignin model compounds with specific
structures. In this study, the effect of lignin structures on AOX
formation and types of chlorinated products by different
structures was studied.
3.2. Experiments. “The reaction mixture was stored in a
refrigerator and analyzed as soon as possible”. How to
ensure the reaction did not continue.
The reaction was terminated by the oxidation of sodium sulfite
with residual chlorine dioxide. In addition, the reaction mixture
was diluted immediately in deionized water to achieve reaction
termination. It has been described more clearly in the revised
version.
3.4. HPLC Analysis. “using a mobile phase composed of
acetonitrile-water (10/90) (vol) and 0.1% acetic acid, a <U+FB02>ow
rate of 0.3 mL·min-1, a temperature of 50 °C, and UV
detection at 280 nm”. If there are some references, please
insert them.
The reference has been inserted in the revised version.
4.1. Effect of reaction time on AOX formation. “Each
individual reaction was performed in a solution with an
initial AOX content of 6.2 mmol and concentration of 124
mmol·L-1”. Please verify if “AOX content” should be
“lignin model compound”.
It has been modified as required.
4.1. Effect of reaction time on AOX formation. “The AOX
content increased within 10 minutes and ultimately reached
1224 mg·L-1”. Please revise the time unit of the manuscript.
The units of time have been modified in the revised version.
4.2. Concentration of lignin model compounds. “The AOX
content formed by the reaction of VE with chlorine dioxide
solution was 60.9 mg·L-1 creating a total concentration of
12.4 mmol·L-1, which is slightly higher than that formed by
VA with chlorine dioxide solution (55.4 mg·L-1)”. The
author needs further explanation in this result.
VA containing phenolic structure has higher reactivity.
Phenolic hydroxyl groups were converted into free radicals for
it was easily attacked by chlorine dioxide. And then the
oxidation fracture of the benzene ring. Most free radicals are
further oxidized by chlorine dioxide to form chlorolipids. It was
further decomposed into muconic acid, ortho-quinone,
para-quinone and oxacyclopropane structures for its unstable
structure. Oxidative fracture of aromatic structures was the
main reaction of VA in chlorine dioxide solution. Therefore,
the lower content of AOX was generated from VA. VE has
lower reactivity due to the absence of phenolic hydroxyl group.
The hydroxymethyl side chain was easier oxidized by chlorine
dioxide. Then chlorine substitution was occured on the
aromatic-ring. More content of AOX was generated at a lower
reaction rate.
4.2. Concentration of lignin model compounds. “The total
AOX content of the separate reaction is less than that of
combined reaction of VA and VE with chlorine dioxide
solution at the same total concentration”. The author needs
further explanation in this result.
Under the condition of excessive lignin model, less VE was
consumed by quantitative chlorine dioxide. This is due to the
low reactivity of non-phenolic lignin. The complete reaction of
VE requires more chlorine dioxide than VA. In combination
reaction of VA and VE, the dosage of chlorine dioxide reacting
with VE increased. The consumption of VE increased
comparing to that in separated reaction of VE. Meanwhile, the
VA shared similar consumption in separated and combined
reaction. Therefore, the total AOX content of the separate
reaction is less than that of combined reaction at the same total
concentration.
As a whole, issues the reviewer suggested are very pertinent, which
are very helpful to modified my entire paper and thank you very much
again.
