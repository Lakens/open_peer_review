1. It is not clear why a second EMD would provide an improvement of the algorithm. The only
evidence has been provided with the choir singers' HRV and respiration data, but judging from
Fig. 7 it seem that the same result could be obtained by IPS followed by filtering with an
appropriate zero-phase lowpass filter. Thus more justification would be needed to convinced that
the second EMD step provides an improvement.
2. Regarding the results presented on the cardiologists' and psychologists' HRV data (Fig. 8), it is
very difficult for me to see the relationship between the glitches and the temporal development of
synchrony. More description would be needed. Consequently, the conclusion: 'These results also
suggest that professionals performing the procedure share the same mental model – they were all
focused on the task, demonstrated situational awareness, and communicated with each other
when glitches occurred' sounds quite far-fetched and should be toned down.
3. Description of Algorithm 1
- (ii): what is the criterion for determining whether an IMF corresponds to a frequency band of
interest? by 'combine' do you mean 'sum'?
- (iii): It is not clear what omega and b stand for. I assume omega means angular frequency and b
is related to the time dimension
4. Description of algorithm 2
- (iii): It is not clear what n denotes. I assume it is related to the time dimension, but previously
(in (i)) it is used to refer to the channels in the signal, which is confusing. Can it be replaced by t?
Minor points:
- p2 par 4: please explain 'magnitude of the physical meaning'
- p13: 'Note that the time instants of the maximum values in both situations are very close to
those of the peaks in the corresponding PSIs in Figure 5b.' -- For me this is not very easy to see in
the figure. It would help if the maximum across frequencies as a function of time would be
plotted.
- p16 par 2: 'Figure 8 shows that pairs of professionals responded to the recorded glitches with
increased HRV' -- the ordinate of the graph shows the PSI, so how can one make any inferences
about HRV based on the figure

This paper presents intrinsic synchrosqueezing transform (ISC) for analysis of coupled nonlinear
and nonstationary multivariate signals. An extension to intrinsic phase synchrony, nested
intrinsic phase synchrony (N-IPS), is also proposed. Algorithms are applied and evaluated both
on synthetic data and on physiological data collected during choir singing and surgical
procedures in order to assess synchrony between the participants.
The topic this paper focuses on is very relevant and interesting under many aspects. From the
point of view of research, the proposed techniques are quite original and open novel directions in
analysis of synchrony and of interactions in coupled signals. In an application perspective, these
techniques can be exploited in a broad variety of experimental scenarios.
The paper is overall very good. Here are some concerns that should be addressed before possible
publication:
- Background and related work: background is mainly discussed with reference to techniques
belonging to the same family of the proposed one or anyway near to the proposed one, i.e., EMD
related techniques. A broader perspective should be adopted, discussing possible relationships
with other approaches to compute synchrony (those based on Recurrence Quantification
Analysis, for example) and highlighting originality and benefits of the proposed technique with
respect to the existing ones. A related work section, separated from the introduction, could be an
option, where the introduction shortly states the aim of the present work and the related work
section discusses the state-of-the-art and how the present work is intended to advance it.
- Description of the algorithms: this is quite difficult to understand without a reference
framework. The proposed algorithms ground on a body of existing techniques. For example, the
proposed intrinsic synchrosqueezing coherence (ISC) combines the NA-MEMD, FSST, and F-
MSST algorithms. Reference papers for such a background are appropriately provided. It is
however difficult for the reader to keep track of all of that. I would suggest to include a section or
an appendix where the mathematical framework for the proposed techniques is summarized.
Further, the last step of the algorithm for N-IPS reads “Combine certain IMFs of the phase
synchrony, which contain physically meaningful and straightforward interpretation”. How are
such pieces of information containing physically meaningful and straightforward interpretation
identified? Is this an automatic or a manual process? How do the algorithm determine physical
meaningfulness? Could the authors provide some examples?
- Comparison with other techniques: the evidence resulting from such a comparison would need
support from statistical analysis when applicable. For example, the average SNRs of TF
representations of synchrony should be tested for assessing possible statistical significance of the
differences found between the SNRs obtained by applying the analyzed techniques.
- Applications: The selection of two different real world testbeds (choir, surgical team) for the
algorithms should be better motivated. This seems to be related to the opportunity of showing
different kinds of analyses (e.g., highly-localized HRV vs. large-scale HRV). The actual
motivations for this choice should however be explicitly mentioned either in the introduction or
(probably better) in the initial part of the applications section.
As for presentation, the paper is overall well written. It sometimes reads somewhat repetitive. An
4
Appendix A showing evaluation against 6 other combinations of algorithms is mentioned (p. 4,
line 47), which does not correspond to the actual content of Appendix A. A ‘k’ is probably
missing in equation 3.1 for x2(t).

Response to Reviewers
sponse to Reviewer 1
thank Reviewer 1 for their detailed comments which have helped us to clarify the material in the
nuscript. Our response is as follows.
viewer 1: 1-1. It is not clear why a second EMD would provide an improvement of the algorithm.
only evidence has been provided with the choir singers’ HRV and respiration data, but judging
m Fig. 7 it seem that the same result could be obtained by IPS followed by filtering with an
ropriate zero-phase lowpass filter. Thus more justification would be needed to convinced that the
ond EMD step provides an improvement.
ply: We have now incorporated the following sentences into the manuscript so as to explain the
antages of using of a second NA-MEMD over low- or band-pass filtering to obtain trends in
chrony:
(i) “Due to the nature of an evensong performance, where all the events have different lengths,
e series of synchrony in singers respiratory and HRV signals typically exhibit nonlinear behaviour
. deformed wave-profiles). Such time series of synchrony can be empirically decomposed using
cond NA-MEMD into a set of physically meaningful nonlinear components (IMFs) of the syn-
ony without prior knowledge of the frequency ranges (periods) of trends. In this way, we obtain
sically meaningful and straightforward interpretation in response to the events, as opposed to low-
and-pass filtering, where cut-off frequencies are rigid, must be determined and specified before-
d, and are person-specific (unlike the proposed approach), which causes physically meaningful
chrony events to be missed.”;
(ii) “Similarly to Section 4(d), a second NA-MEMD was employed to obtain trends in synchrony
he surgeons’ HRV signals in order to cater for: (i) the nonlinear behaviour of the synchrony mea-
e and (ii) the lack of prior knowledge of the frequency ranges (periods) of trends, thus providing
sically meaningful and straightforward interpretation in response to glitches.”
viewer 1: 1-2. Regarding the results presented on the cardiologists’ and psychologists’ HRV
a (Fig. 8), it is very difficult for me to see the relationship between the glitches and the temporal
elopment of synchrony. More description would be needed. Consequently, the conclusion: ‘These
ults also suggest that professionals performing the procedure share the same mental model they
e all focused on the task, demonstrated situational awareness, and communicated with each other
en glitches occurred’ sounds quite far-fetched and should be toned down.
ply: Agreed and amended.
viewer 1: 1-3. Description of Algorithm 1
• (ii): what is the criterion for determining whether an IMF corresponds to a frequency band of
interest? by ‘combine’ do you mean ’sum’?
• (iii): It is not clear what omega and b stand for. I assume omega means angular frequency and
b is related to the time dimension
ply: Many thanks for bringing up these issues. Our response is as follows:
• (ii): what is the criterion for determining whether an IMF corresponds to a frequency band of
interest? by ‘combine’ do you mean ’sum’?
2
By observing the Fourier spectra of IMFs, we can choose an IMF which governs the frequency
band of interest, and by ‘combine’ we mean ‘sum’. The manuscript has been amended accord-
ingly.
• (iii): It is not clear what omega and b stand for. I assume omega means angular frequency and
b is related to the time dimension
The variables ‘omega’ and ‘b’ were mistakenly used in the equation and have been replaced by
‘f’ and ‘t’. The manuscript has been amended accordingly.

ted to the time dimension, but previously (in (i)) it is used to refer to the channels in the signal,
ch is confusing. Can it be replaced by t?
ply: Agreed. The variable ‘n’ has been replaced by ‘t’ in the manuscript.
viewer 1: Minor points:
• p2 par 4: please explain ‘magnitude of the physical meaning’
• p13: ‘Note that the time instants of the maximum values in both situations are very close to
those of the peaks in the corresponding PSIs in Figure 5b.’ – For me this is not very easy to see
in the figure. It would help if the maximum across frequencies as a function of time would be
plotted.
• p16 par 2: ‘Figure 8 shows that pairs of professionals responded to the recorded glitches with
increased HRV’ – the ordinate of the graph shows the PSI, so how can one make any inferences
about HRV based on the figure
ply: Many thanks for pointing to these issues. Our response is as follows:
• p2 par 4: please explain ‘magnitude of the physical meaning’
We have amended the sentence “regardless of the differences in the magnitude of the physical
meaning in intrinsic oscillations between data channels obtained using NA-MEMD” to read:
“regardless of the differences in the magnitude of intrinsic oscillations between data channels
obtained using NA-MEMD”.
• p13: ‘Note that the time instants of the maximum values in both situations are very close to
those of the peaks in the corresponding PSIs in Figure 5b.’ – For me this is not very easy to see
in the figure. It would help if the maximum across frequencies as a function of time would be
plotted.
Instead of comparing the time instants of the maximum values of SCIs against those of the
peaks in the corresponding PSIs, we have compared: (i) patterns of temporal dynamics of the
sums of SCI values across frequencies against temporal dynamics of the corresponding PSIs;
(ii) time instants of the maximum values of the sum of SCIs across frequencies. This shows
the readers explicit resemblances between the degrees of synchrony estimated using the ISC
and IPS algorithms. Note that due to the relatively ‘faster’ temporal dynamics of the sum of
SCI values, we employed MEMD to empirically decompose the sum of SCI values into two
sets of ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ oscillatory components (IMFs). This provides fair and straightforward
comparisons in patterns of temporal dynamics between the combinations of the IMFs in the
latter set and the corresponding PSIs. The manuscript has been amended accordingly.

• p16 par 2: ‘Figure 8 shows that pairs of professionals responded to the recorded glitches with
increased HRV’ – the ordinate of the graph shows the PSI, so how can one make any inferences
about HRV based on the figure
Agreed. We have amended the sentence “pairs of professionals responded to the recorded
glitches with increased HRV” to read “physiological responses of pairs of professionals re-
sponded to the recorded glitches with increased synchrony in HRV”.
sponse to Reviewer 2
wish to thank Reviewer 2 for their insightful comments and for providing further perspective for
material in the manuscript. Our response is as follows.
viewer 2: 2-1. Background and related work: background is mainly discussed with reference to
hniques belonging to the same family of the proposed one or anyway near to the proposed one, i.e.,
D related techniques. A broader perspective should be adopted, discussing possible relationships
h other approaches to compute synchrony (those based on Recurrence Quantification Analysis,
example) and highlighting originality and benefits of the proposed technique with respect to the
ting ones. A related work section, separated from the introduction, could be an option, where
introduction shortly states the aim of the present work and the related work section discusses the
e-of-the-art and how the present work is intended to advance it.
ply: We appreciate these suggestions and have incorporated a Related Work section in the revised
nuscript.
viewer 2: 2-2. Description of the algorithms:
• this is quite difficult to understand without a reference framework. The proposed algorithms
ground on a body of existing techniques. For example, the proposed intrinsic synchrosqueezing
coherence (ISC) combines the NA-MEMD, FSST, and F-MSST algorithms. Reference papers
for such a background are appropriately provided. It is however difficult for the reader to keep
track of all of that. I would suggest to include a section or an appendix where the mathematical
framework for the proposed techniques is summarized.
• Further, the last step of the algorithm for N-IPS reads Combine certain IMFs of the phase
synchrony, which contain physically meaningful and straightforward interpretation. How are
such pieces of information containing physically meaningful and straightforward interpretation
identified? Is this an automatic or a manual process? How do the algorithm determine physical
meaningfulness? Could the authors provide some examples?

Agreed. We have added Appendix (a-c) into the revised manuscript in order to respectively
summarise the NA-MEMD, FSST, and F-MSST algorithms, and moved the former Appendix
(a) ‘Areal Density’ to Appendix (d).
• Further, the last step of the algorithm for N-IPS reads Combine certain IMFs of the phase
synchrony, which contain physically meaningful and straightforward interpretation. How are
such pieces of information containing physically meaningful and straightforward interpretation
identified? Is this an automatic or a manual process? How do the algorithm determine physical
meaningfulness? Could the authors provide some examples?
In practice such pieces of information must be empirically identified and cannot be determined
automatically by the algorithm. To better clarify and exemplify this, the following sentences
– “Certain IMFs of the multivariate synchrony produced by the NA-MEMD which exhibited
physically meaningful and interpretable trends in synchrony were then combined.”;
– “The IMFs produced by the NA-MEMD with indices 10-12 of the multivariate PSI values
contained the physically meaningful periods of 15 minutes to 1 hour. The trends of interest
in the synchrony were produced by summing up these IMFs.”
have been amended to read, respectively:
– “Certain IMFs of the multivariate synchrony (synchrony-IMFs) produced by the NA-
MEMD (IMFs 5–7 for the respiratory synchrony, 5–6 for the HRV synchrony) were then
combined, since the combinations of the synchrony-IMFs admit capturing of physically
meaningful and interpretable trends in the respiratory and HRV synchrony, that is, tempo-
ral dynamics of the combinations of the synchrony-IMFs closely resemble the timings of
the songs and the pauses, where increases (during songs) and decreases (during pauses)
in trends of the physiological synchrony, i.e. the level of cooperation, were physiologi-
cally expected to be observed. The other IMFs, on the other hand, were neglected due
to no physical meaning or straightforward interpretation; their temporal dynamics did not
resemble the timings of the songs and the pauses, and distinct increases and decreases
in trends of the synchrony during the songs and the pauses, respectively, cannot be ob-
served.”;
– “The IMFs produced by the NA-MEMD with indices 10–12 of the multivariate PSI values
were combined to produce trends in the synchrony, since these combinations best repre-
sented changes in trends of the synchrony in response to gliches.”
In addition to these amendments and in order to improve our explanation of IMFs regarding the
physical meaning, we have amended the following sentences “Unlike conventional projection-
based time-frequency algorithms, such as the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the dis-
crete wavelet transform (DWT), the IMFs – the adaptive basis functions within EMD – enable
physically meaningful interpretation of instantaneous phase and frequency.” to read
“Unlike conventional projection-based time-frequency algorithms, such as the short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the IMFs – the adaptive basis
functions within EMD – enable physical interpretation for nonlinear signals, because IMFs are
theoretically designated as intrinsic oscillations with intrawave amplitude and frequency mod-
ulation, with a physical meaning that the amplitudes and frequencies of these basis functions
can intrinsically and nonlinearly vary over time. Standard algorithms, on the other hand, em-
ploy rigid basis functions with fixed frequencies (cosine in STFT, wavelet function in DWT),
and therefore linear superpositions of additional harmonic components are required to represent
nonlinear signals, thus spreading energy over a wider, higher frequency range and not admitting
physical interpretation.”

uld need support from statistical analysis when applicable. For example, the average SNRs of
representations of synchrony should be tested for assessing possible statistical significance of the
erences found between the SNRs obtained by applying the analyzed techniques.
ply: We have performed extensive simulations by applying all the techniques considered to both of
tasks using SNRs ranging from -10 dB to 20 dB, thus allowing us to assess statistical significance.
Z-test at a significance level of 0.01 was performed, in order to reveal statistical differences in
SNRs between the proposed ISC algorithm and the second best combination in both the tasks.
rage SNRs of the proposed ISC algorithm (3.593 dB and 13.66 dB) were 3.625 dB and 3.2 dB
nificantly higher (p-value= 0.0001 and 0.0004 respectively) than those (-0.032 dB and 10.46 dB)
he second best combination. The manuscript has been amended accordingly.
viewer 2: 2-4. Applications: The selection of two different real world testbeds (choir, surgical
m) for the algorithms should be better motivated. This seems to be related to the opportunity of
wing different kinds of analyses (e.g., highly-localized HRV vs. large-scale HRV). The actual moti-
ons for this choice should however be explicitly mentioned either in the introduction or (probably
er) in the initial part of the applications section.
ply: We have added a subsection ‘Motivation’ into each of the real-world applications sections for
licit explanation of its motivation.
viewer 2: 2-5. As for presentation, the paper is overall well written. It sometimes reads somewhat
etitive. An Appendix A showing evaluation against 6 other combinations of algorithms is men-
ed (p. 4, line 47), which does not correspond to the actual content of Appendix A. A k is probably
sing in equation 3.1 for x2(t).
ply: Agreed and corrected. This sentence has been removed, since the evaluation is in fact pre-
ted in Section 3(a-b). A variable ‘k’ was indeed missing from the equation but has been incorpo-
d in the revised manuscript.
