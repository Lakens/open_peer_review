Summary
This manuscript presented an experimental study to determine the kinetics and pathways of
muscovite decomposition and vanadium release in the alkaline fusion process. A combinative
solid phase characterization (using XRD, SEM, and FTIR), kinetics investigation, and
thermodynamic analysis were applied to elucidate the release mechanism of vanadium. Overall
some meaningful results were presented; however, several parts still need to be further clarified,
as detailed below.
Comments
1. The language needs to be significantly polished. Numerous grammar mistakes are present in
the current manuscript.
2. Page 3 of 28, Lines 4 – 6. The sentence “the difficulty of vanadium extraction from vanadium
shale is determined by the occurrence of vanadium in muscovite” is hard to follow. Please revise.
3. Page 4 of 28, Lines 10 – 12. Compared to the raw ore, phase transformation was observed for
the blank roasted sample along with the occurrence of some new crystalline phases through the
pre-treatment process. Why did the phase transformation occur and would such transformation
be expected?
4. Page 4 of 28, Lines 51 – 55. The description of roasting temperature, roasting time, and leaching
temperature can be moved to 2.2. Experimental procedures and analytical methods.
5. Both Figs 1 and 3 presented XRD patterns and some information is overlapped. Thus, these
two figures can be combined into one figure.
6. Page 5 of 28, Line 9. Based on Fig. 2, the authors stated that the optimum roasting temperature
is 500 °C in the experimental condition (300 – 700 °C). While the authors observed some
differences in the XRD patterns of the materials under different roasting temperature, it is still not
quite clear to this reviewer why 500 °C resulted in a higher V recovery efficiency than other
temperatures. More discussion should be included on the optimum roasting temperature.
7. Page 6 of 28, Line 51. What did the authors mean and how did the authors prove that “the
relevance of V, K, O, Si and Al was quite good”? The description can be clearer.
8. Page 7 of 28, Lines 11 – 14. Based on XRD, SEM, and FTIR, the authors found that muscovite
converted into sodium silicate and gehlenite in the alkaline fusion process. How did such process
generate expension and crack to muscovite and facilitate the release of vanadium? Such
statement is a bit hypothetical. Any evidence to show that?
9. Page 7 of 28, Lines 44 – 47. In the kinetics analysis the authors stated that the vanadium
transformation efficiency increased with increasing roasting temperature, which is inconsistent
with their previous statement that 500 °C is optimum in the range of 300 – 700 °C.
10. Page 8 of 28, Lines 10 – 12. How did the authors determine g (the conversion rate of
vanadium) to be 0.688%?
11. Page 8 of 28, discussion on rate-controlling steps. The authors first mentioned that during the
whole reaction time, the rate of reaction is controlled by diffusion (Lines 20 – 22). Then they
found that the alkaline fusion reaction was controlled by chemical reaction (Page 9 of 28, Lines 2 –
4). These two statements seem inconsistent. The authors should state clearer that what stages
4
would be controlled by diffusion and chemical reaction, respectively.

Title: "Effect of alkaline fusion on muscovite decomposition and the
vanadium release mechanism from vanadium shale"
Authors: Jian, Xingwen; Huang, Jing; Cai, Zhenlei; Zhang, Yimin; Liu,
Tao; Liu, Hong
Dear Professor Anthony Stace and Claire Carmalt,
Thank you very much for sending us the reviewers’ report and giving us an
opportunity to revise our manuscript. We are truly grateful to you and the
reviewers for the constructive comments regarding our paper entitled “Effect of
alkaline fusion on muscovite decomposition and the vanadium release mechanism
from vanadium shale”. (RSOS-180700)
Those comments are all valuable for improving our paper, as well as the
important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied comments
carefully and have made revisions which we hope meet with approval. The revised
portions are all marked in red in the revised manuscript. The main revisions and
the responses to the reviewers’ comments are given below.
Response to comments
Reviewer 1:
This paper analyzed the decomposition process of muscovite and the phase
evolution of vanadium in vanadium shale alkaline fusion reaction. It als explain
the mechanism of muscovite structure collapse and vanadium release mechanism
in vanadium shale by alkaline fusion. Specially, the kinetic model of vanadium
extraction from vanadium shale using alkaline fusion could be finally established.
I think if the questions or suggestion as followed would be explained, the paper
would be published in the journal.
Comment 1: Page 5 Line 17, In Fig. 3, different roasting temperature and the
blank roasted sample need to be identified.
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on our
manuscript. We feel very sorry for not indicating the different roasting temperature
and the blank roasted sample in Fig. 3. According to this valuable suggestion, we
have scrutinized and revised our manuscript to ensure the right form.
Comment 2: Page 6 Line 50, Is Fig. 7 (a) the sample before alkaline fusion?
Also, is the Fig. 7 (b) the sample after alkaline fusion? I think that SEM-EDS
analysis should include the raw sample and different temperature samples so that
the result could be proved from the change of surface and elements analyses.
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on our
manuscript. I do agree that SEM-EDS analysis should include the raw sample and
different temperature samples to obtain the behaviors of the change about surface
and elements analyses during alkaline fusion processes.
From the results of the experiments, it can be concluded that the most
appropriate temperature for roasting experiments was chosen at 500 °C. Thus, in
order to obtain a most representative visualized insight of the change about surface
and elements analyses during alkaline fusion processes, the vanadium shale
alkaline fusion samples at 500 °C and the blank roasted sample was selected as
the optimal analysis sample.
So, the SEM-EDS analysis of the blank roasted sample (the raw sample) and
the vanadium shale alkaline fusion samples at 500 °C (the most representative
sample) is presented in Fig. 7. The sample before alkaline fusion shows in Fig. 7
(a) and the sample after alkaline fusion shows in Fig. 7 (b).
Comment 3: It is better to analyses the influence of the aluminosilicate in the
production during the water leaching process. Because the aluminosilicate are
easily to form a colloid that decrease the leach rate of V.
Response: We are grateful for the reviewer’s constructive comments. We
apologize for not clearly presenting the influence of the aluminosilicate in the
production during the water leaching process. According to the comment, we
would like to state the viewpoints as follows.
According to our research group recently published work in RSC Advances,
during the water leaching process, the tetragonal crystalline structure of gehlenite
(Ca2Al2SiO7) was converted into the monoclinic crystalline structure of
Ca3Si2O7·H2O. Ca3Si2O7·H2O, a kind of C–S–H gel, probably covered the surface
of the muscovite and thus prevented the effective extraction of vanadium from the
muscovite [1].
As for our manuscript, the 84.63% of the maximized vanadium leaching
efficiency was obtained. It can be seen that the vanadium leaching efficiency
observed to be nearly constant as the mass ratio of NaOH to blank roasted sample
exceeded 1:1 g/g, which indicated that the mostly influence of the roasting process
on the vanadium leaching efficiency already arrived extreme achievement.
Therefore, the phase transformation about gehlenite during the water leaching
process has an important impact on the vanadium leaching efficiency. The colloid,
which was produced by gehlenite during the water leaching process covered the
surface of the muscovite and thus decreased the leaching efficiency of V.

Comment 4: Page 7 Line 44, Why the fixed mass fixed mass ratio of NaOH to
blank roasted sample at 1:1 g/g?
Response: We thank the reviewer for the useful comment. We apologize for not
clearly presenting detailed explanations of the fixed mass fixed mass ratio of
NaOH to blank roasted sample at 1:1 g/g. According to the comment, we would
like to state the viewpoints as follows.
The effects of mass ratio of NaOH to blank roasted sample on the vanadium
leaching efficiency are shown in Fig. 1, and the roasting temperature is fixed at
500 °C, the roasting time is fixed of 1 h. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the mass
ratio of NaOH to blank roasted sample significantly influenced the vanadium
leaching efficiency. When the mass ratio of NaOH to blank roasted sample varied
from 0 to1:1 g/g, the vanadium leaching efficiency was 0.688% and 84.63%,
respectively. The vanadium leaching efficiency observed to be nearly constant as
the mass ratio of NaOH to blank roasted sample exceeded 1:1 g/g. Therefore, the
mass ratio of NaOH to blank roasted sample at 1:1 g/g was selected as the optimal
condition.
Fig. 1 Effects of mass ratio of NaOH to blank roasted sample on vanadium leaching
efficiency.
In the kinetics analysis, the experiments was carried out with the similar
methods of alkaline fusion experiments. Thus, the fixed mass fixed mass ratio of
NaOH to blank roasted sample at 1:1 g/g.
Comment 5: Page 8 Line 12, Please give the detail calculation process of G,
0.668%.
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on our
manuscript. We feel very sorry for not giving detail calculation process about the
conversion rate of vanadium in blank roasted process (which is marked as
G=0.668%) in our manuscript. According to the comment, we would like to state
the viewpoints as follows.
Since minute quantities of vanadium has been converted in the blank roasting
process, the conversion rate of vanadium in the blank roasting process should be
deducted when calculating the conversion rate of vanadium during the alkaline
fusion process. To evaluate the conversion rate of vanadium in blank roasted
process, the blank roasted sample direct water leaching experiment was conducted
under the conditions of a leaching temperature of 60 °C, a leaching time of 1 h and
a liquid-solid ratio of 4.0 mL/g. The vanadium leaching efficiency was calculated
as follows:
V<U+F062>
<U+F068>= <U+F0B4>100%
m<U+F061>
(1)
where <U+0220> is the leaching efficiency of vanadium (wt%), V is the volume of the
leaching solution (mL), ß is the content of vanadium in the leaching solution
(g/mL), m is the mass of the blank roasted sample of vanadium shale (g), and a is
the content of vanadium in the blank roasted sample of vanadium shale (wt%).
During the blank roasted sample direct water leaching experiment, the
volume of the leaching solution (L) was 211 mL, the content of vanadium in the
leaching solution (ß) was 0.4494 g/L, the mass of the blank roasted sample of
vanadium shale (m) was 30 g, the content of vanadium in the blank roasted sample
of vanadium shale (a) was 0.459%. According to the eq. (1), the leaching
efficiency of vanadium (<U+0220>) was calculated as 0.668%.
As mentioned in our manuscript, as the roasting-water leaching technology,
a series of chemical reactions of vanadium have been examined to occur in the
roasting process, and the dissolution of vanadate was the main action in the process
of water leaching [1,2]. Therefore, the transformation efficiency of vanadium in
the roasting process can be used to evaluate the roasting effect. Thus, the
conversion rate of vanadium in blank roasted process (which is marked as G) in
our manuscript can be calculated as the leaching efficiency of vanadium (<U+0220>). So,
the G= <U+0220>=0.668%.

pathways of muscovite decomposition and vanadium release in the alkaline fusion
process. A combinative solid phase characterization (using XRD, SEM, and FTIR),
kinetics investigation, and thermodynamic analysis were applied to elucidate the
release mechanism of vanadium. Overall some meaningful results were presented;
however, several parts still need to be further clarified, as detailed below.
Comment 1: The language needs to be significantly polished. Numerous
grammar mistakes are present in the current manuscript.
Response: We feel very sorry that our written English does not meet the
standards. According to the reviewer’s comment, we have scrutinized and revised
our manuscript.
Comment 2: Page 3 of 28, Lines 4 – 6. The sentence “the difficulty of vanadium
extraction from vanadium shale is determined by the occurrence of vanadium in
muscovite” is hard to follow. Please revise.
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on our
manuscript. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised the sentence
of our manuscript as below.
(Original sentence:)
the difficulty of vanadium extraction from vanadium shale is determined by the
occurrence of vanadium in muscovite
(Revised sentence:)
substantial attention has been given the structural breakdown of muscovite in
vanadium shale.
Comment 3: Page 4 of 28, Lines 10 – 12. Compared to the raw ore, phase
transformation was observed for the blank roasted sample along with the
occurrence of some new crystalline phases through the pre-treatment process.
Why did the phase transformation occur and would such transformation be
expected?
Response: We are grateful for the reviewer’s constructive comments. We
apologize for not clearly presenting the reason about these phase transformation.
According to the comment, we would like to state the viewpoints as follows.
The raw vanadium shale was subjected to carbon removal pre-treatment by
blank roasting in a muffle furnace at 700 °C for 1 h. During the blank roasting
process, the phase of pyrite (FeS2) could not exist in an oxidizing atmosphere, it
rapidly transformed into hematite (Fe2O3), and the phase of calcite (CaCO3) was
converted into the anhydrite (CaSO4). The main reactions during the blank
roasting process with pyrite (FeS2) and calcite (CaCO3) could be expressed as eqs
(1) to (4), [1] respectively.
4FeS2 <U+F02B> 11O2 <U+F0AE> 2Fe2O3 <U+F02B> 8SO2

leaching temperature have moved to 2.2, the experimental procedures and

Comment 5: Both Figs 1 and 3 presented XRD patterns and some information
is overlapped. Thus, these two figures can be combined into one figure.
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment. We apologize
for providing too many figures in our previous manuscript. It is really true as the
reviewer suggested that the previous Figs 1 and 3 presented XRD patterns and
some information is overlapped. Considering the valuable comment, we have
combined these two figures into Fig. 3.

Comment 6: Page 5 of 28, Line 9. Based on Fig. 2, the authors stated that the
optimum roasting temperature is 500 °C in the experimental condition (300 –
700 °C). While the authors observed some differences in the XRD patterns of the
materials under different roasting temperature, it is still not quite clear to this
reviewer why 500 °C resulted in a higher V recovery efficiency than other
temperatures. More discussion should be included on the optimum roasting
temperature.
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on our
manuscript. We apologize for not giving the reason why why 500 °C resulted in a
higher V recovery efficiency than other temperatures. According to the comment,
we would like to state the viewpoints as follows.
(1) As mentioned in our manuscript, the reaction of melted NaOH with
muscovite as the roasting temperature increased, generating expension and crack
to muscovite, which facilitate the release of vanadium. Thus, the the vanadium
leaching efficiency increased with an increase in the roasting temperature.
(2) When the roasting temperature exceeded a certain level (500 °C), the
vanadium leaching efficiency decreased because of the sintering of the materials.
Some of the minerals in the vanadium shale reacted to generate glass-like materials
and a complex silicate with a low melting point. These reactants wrapped the
particles and impeded the transport of vanadium into the leaching solution [1,2].
Therefore, the temperature for alkaline fusion experiments at 500 °C resulted
in a higher V recovery efficiency than other temperatures.

Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s useful comment. According to
the comment, we would like to state the viewpoints as follows.
(1) As mentioned in our manuscript, the good relevance of V, K, O, Si and Al
in the view field from the EDS elemental mapping micrographs indicated that the
particle in the view filed mainly consisted of V, K, O, Si and Al elements, and the
atom percentages of K, O, Si and Al at the point of “M” were similar to those of
muscovite, indicating that the vanadium still existed within the muscovite.
(2) Many researchers have reported that the relevance of element in the view
field from the EDS elemental mapping micrographs was connected with the
profile and denseness of the element [1-4]. As mentioned in our manuscript, the
insight of the profile of V, K, O, Si and Al was clear, and the distribution of V, K,
O, Si and Al was intensively, implying that the relevance of V, K, O, Si and Al was
good in the view field from the EDS elemental mapping micrographs.
Thanks very much for the reviewer’s constructive suggestion on our research.

Comment 8: Page 7 of 28, Lines 11 – 14. Based on XRD, SEM, and FTIR, the
authors found that muscovite converted into sodium silicate and gehlenite in the
alkaline fusion process. How did such process generate expension and crack to
muscovite and facilitate the release of vanadium? Such statement is a bit
hypothetical. Any evidence to show that?
Response: We thank a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. We apologize for
not giving the the reason why the alkaline fusion process can generate expension
and crack to muscovite and facilitate the release of vanadium. According to the
comment, we would like to state the viewpoints as follows.
(1) The alkaline fusion experiments indicated that the addition of NaOH
can greatly enhance the vanadium leaching efficiency
As mentioned in our manuscript, under the conditions of the appropriate
alkaline fusion experiments, 84.63% of the vanadium leaching efficiency was
obtained, it can be concluded that the alkaline fusion process had an efficient
extraction of vanadium from the vanadium shale though drawing molten alkali to
produce local deformation of muscovite particles for completely decomposition
of the muscovite.
(2) Different analytical methods (XRD, SEM, FTIR and thermodynamic
analysis) have proved that the transformation of muscovite converts into the
sodium silicate and gehlenite during alkaline fusion process.

The XRD analysis (Fig. 3) showed that a significant disappearance of
muscovite peaks intensity from blank roasted sample to alkaline fusion products,
thus indicating that the muscovite structures were thoroughly disintegrated when
sodium hydroxide was introduced into the roasting process. Meanwhile, there
were two new chemical phases of sodium silicate and gehlenite observed in the
XRD patterns of the alkaline fusion samples, deducing that the appearance of new
chemical phases were due to chemical reaction between muscovite and motlen
sodium hydroxide.
The thermodynamic analysis (Table 2 and Fig. 4) was researched to analyze
the chemical reaction of the alkaline fusion, especially the feasibility of muscovite
decomposition, when the phase transformation during alkaline fusion process
were found from the XRD analysis. It has been proved that the <U+0394>G<U+03B8> (500 °C)
values were -51.42KJ·mol-1 for the vanadium shale alkaline fusion reaction
equations (Eq. (2)), indicating that it was spontaneous at 500 °C during alkaline
fusion process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the chemical reaction between
muscovite and motlen sodium hydroxide during alkaline fusion was true.

To make clear the change of lattice bonding structure during alkaline fusion
process, the FTIR analysis (Fig. 6) was carried out. The main changes in the
spectra of the alkaline fusion samples occur at the feature bands (bands 3 and 7)
of muscovite reflects subtle changes in the muscovite structure during the alkaline
fusion process.

SEM-EDS analysis (Fig. 7) was conducted to obtain a visualized insight of
the behaviors of the vanadium occurrence state during alkaline fusion processes.
As shown in Fig. 7(a), the relevance of V, K, O, Si and Al was quite good, and the
K, O, Si and Al atom percentages at point “M” were close to those of muscovite,
proving that V still existed in the muscovite. On the contrary, it is clearly seen
from Fig. 7(b) that not only the Na, Si and O, but also the Ca, Al, Si and O had
obvious relevance, indicating that the gehlenite and sodium silicate indeed existed
after the alkaline fusion process. Combined with the XRD, FTIR and
thermodynamic analyses, concluding that the gehlenite and sodium silicate were
surely from the chemical reaction between muscovite and motlen sodium
hydroxide.

In general, through scientific designed alkaline fusion experiments, we found
drawing molten NaOH can greatly enhance the vanadium leaching efficiency.
Then, different analytical methods have proved that the transformation of
muscovite converts into the sodium silicate and gehlenite during alkaline fusion
process. Thus, we conclud that the transformation of muscovite converts into the
sodium silicate and gehlenite furthering dissolution of silicon, generating
expension and crack to muscovite, which facilitate the release of vanadium.
Thanks very much for the reviewer’s constructive suggestion on our research.
Comment 9: Page 7 of 28, Lines 44 – 47. In the kinetics analysis the authors
stated that the vanadium transformation efficiency increased with increasing
roasting temperature, which is inconsistent with their previous statement that
500 °C is optimum in the range of 300 – 700 °C.
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on our
manuscript. We apologize for not giving the reason why 500 °C was selected as
the optimal roasting temperature, though the vanadium transforming efficiency
increased with the increase of the roasting temperature. According to the comment,
we would like to state the viewpoints as follows.
The alkaline fusion experiments in our manuscript have proved that the
vanadium leaching efficiencies of the roasted products increased with an increase
in the roasting temperature. However, the vanadium transforming efficiency
observed to be decrease as the roasting temperature exceeded 500 °C, which was
resulted from a sintering phenomenon [1,2].
In the kinetics analysis, the experiments was carried out with the similar
methods of alkaline fusion experiments. Thus, the vanadium transforming
efficiencies increased as the roasting temperature increased, in the overall alkaline
fusion experiments. Considering that the vanadium transforming efficiency
decreased when the roasting temperature was over 500 °C, therefore, 500 °C was
selected as the optimal roasting temperature, though the vanadium transforming
efficiency increased with the increase of the roasting temperature.

Comment 10: Page 8 of 28, Lines 10 – 12. How did the authors determine g
(the conversion rate of vanadium) to be 0.688%?
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on our
manuscript. We feel very sorry for not giving detail calculation process about the
conversion rate of vanadium in blank roasted process (which is marked as
g=0.668%) in our manuscript. According to the comment, we would like to state
the viewpoints as follows.
Since minute quantities of vanadium has been converted in the blank roasting
process, the conversion rate of vanadium in the blank roasting process should be
deducted when calculating the conversion rate of vanadium during the alkaline
fusion process. To evaluate the conversion rate of vanadium in blank roasted
process, the blank roasted sample direct water leaching experiment was conducted
under the conditions of a leaching temperature of 60 °C, a leaching time of 1 h and
a liquid-solid ratio of 4.0 mL/g. The vanadium leaching efficiency was calculated
as follows:
V<U+F062>
<U+F068>= <U+F0B4>100%
m<U+F061>
(6)
where <U+0220> is the leaching efficiency of vanadium (wt%), V is the volume of the
leaching solution (mL), ß is the content of vanadium in the leaching solution
(g/mL), m is the mass of the blank roasted sample of vanadium shale (g), and a is
the content of vanadium in the blank roasted sample of vanadium shale (wt%).
During the blank roasted sample direct water leaching experiment, the
volume of the leaching solution (L) was 211 mL, the content of vanadium in the
leaching solution (ß) was 0.4494 g/L, the mass of the blank roasted sample of
vanadium shale (m) was 30 g, the content of vanadium in the blank roasted sample
of vanadium shale (a) was 0.459%. According to the eq. (6), he leaching efficiency
of vanadium (<U+0220>) was calculated as 0.668%
As mentioned in our manuscript, as the roasting-water leaching technology,
a series of chemical reactions of vanadium have been examined to occur in the
roasting process, and the dissolution of vanadate was the main action in the process
of water leaching [1,2]. Therefore, the transformation efficiency of vanadium in
the roasting process can be used to evaluate the roasting effect. Thus, the
conversion rate of vanadium in blank roasted process (which is marked as G) in
our manuscript can be calculated as the leaching efficiency of vanadium (<U+0220>). So,
the G= <U+0220>=0.668%.

Comment 11: Page 8 of 28, discussion on rate-controlling steps. The authors
first mentioned that during the whole reaction time, the rate of reaction is
controlled by diffusion (Lines 20 – 22). Then they found that the alkaline fusion
reaction was controlled by chemical reaction (Page 9 of 28, Lines 2 – 4). These
two statements seem inconsistent. The authors should state clearer that what stages
would be controlled by diffusion and chemical reaction, respectively.
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on our
manuscript. We apologize for not giving the clearer state about what stages would
be controlled by diffusion and chemical reaction, respectively. According to the
comment, we would like to state the viewpoints as follows.
Many researchers have reported that the vanadium-containing carrier in the
vanadium shale alkaline fusion system could be analyzed using the dynamic model
of flaky structure mineral roasting process [1,2].
Based on the results from the alkaline fusion experiments, it can be seen that
the alkaline fusion process was obvious divided into two stages. In the first period
of the roasting time, the vanadium transforming efficiency increased rapidly,
however, further extension of the roasting time had no improved the vanadium
transforming efficiency. Therefore, it can be concluded that the early stage of
roasting process is controlled by chemical reaction, but the reaction process
transformed into diffusion control quickly.
The controlling step alkaline fusion shown in the table as follows.
