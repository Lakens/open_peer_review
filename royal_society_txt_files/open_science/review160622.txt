The manuscript presents data on endocranial volume in red deer and aims to establish whether
endocranial volume is (1) heritable and (2) is associated with differential fitness. If animals with
larger endocrianial cavity have higher fitness, then endocranial cavity and hence brain size is
under selection. The study takes advantage of a long-term study of red deer with known
pedigrees. Evolution of the brain size has lately received lots of attention, both positive and
critical and so the question of the current study is of considerable interest to behavioral and
cognitive biologists.
The results of heritability of the cranial volume seem solid, yet the results and conclusions about
the fitness associations are not.
My main criticism is the incorrect statistical methods. First, the authors use residuals from a
regression between endocrinal volume and jaw length in separate analyses. The use of residuals
has been criticized numerous times as it leads to spurious results (see Darlington and Smulders,
2001, Anim. Behav. 62: 599-602; but there are many others). The authors should re-do their
analyses and include absolute endocranial volume and jaw length as two independent variables
in the same analyses.
Second, using residuals produced by the endocranial volume and jaw length and jaw length in
the same analyses is a textbook example of violation of independence – the same variable is used
twice as independent. The bottom line is that all analyses testing whether longevity, fecundity,
life-time breeding success and life-time reproductive success must be re-done correctly by using
absolute endocranial volume and jaw length as two independent variables.
Given a fairly large sample size, the significance level of currently presented results are really
small – P = 0.02 and 0.03. This suggests really small effect size, which also needs to be reported.
Age of animals at the time of death (when the skull was extracted) needs to be included as a
variable in all analyses of fitness as a function of endocranial volume because it changes with age.
Finally, there were no significant associations between the endocrinal volume and fitness in
males, yet the authors conclude that larger endocranial volume ‘…confers advantages’. But it is
not at all clear why this association is only true in females, but not males. Given large sample size
and seemingly small effect size, these results do not provide convincing evidence that brain size
is important for fitness in this species. Given that jaw size is a highly significant predictor of all
fitness parameters, my suspicion is that when the analyses are re-done correctly, the effect of
endocranial volume on fitness will disappear.
Also, a lot of statistical methods seem like a giant fishing expedition with a goal to support what
is viewed important. Dropping variables resembles much criticized step-wise regression. The
authors should think critically about which variables are biologically important and use them all.

Dear Editor,
In the presented manuscript Logan et al. describe the results of a large study on the relationship
between endocranial volumes and aspects of fitness and heritability in the famous Isle of Rum
red deer. The authors compiled an impressive data set and the statistics are explained excellently.
The data is not oversold and the conclusions seem justified. As such I enjoyed reading the paper
and am sure others will as well. However, I have a few points that I think should be addressed.
Line 13 I think that the niche for this manuscript is bigger than what this sentence makes it looks
like. The fact that no one has shown a microevolutionary relationship between brain size and
longevity in mammals seems like a weak justification for investigating it. I recommend pitching it
broader and extending the (surprisingly short) abstract accordingly.
Line 72 This citation is a paper on bird endocranial volume. What is the evidence that endocranial
volume is also a good predictor of mammal, even deer actual brain size? This is quite an
important aspect and it should be clarified that the proxy used is adequate.
Line 85 This is another (maybe the most) critical step: How sure is it that jaw length is a good
enough indicator of body size? What other factors influence jaw length? Here is an alternative
physiological scenario:
High testosterone is known to increase jaw size (not only in humans, but in several vertebrates) –
leading to relatively smaller brains than if normalized for body size. High levels of testosterone
also generally decrease longevity and fecundity/fitness (at least in humans, so potentially also in
red deer) – this would lead to the same result: seemingly smaller relative brains (because larger
jaws) coincide with decreased life span and fitness.
It would be great if the authors could address this issue.
Line 262 But the Tsuboi et al. paper did show a negative association between brain and gut.

Figure 1 It is evident that a lot of males do not father a single offspring. It might be worth
exploring the data set without those unsuccessful males. Potentially, also comparing endocranial
volumes between successful and unsuccessful males. But maybe that is the topic of an upcoming
manuscript?
Figure 1A & 2 C - I acknowledge that the associations are statistically significant, but seeing the
raw data like this is not convincing.

My only minor suggestion is to include some discussion of how the authors think selection may

should have larger brain relative to body size than males? If there is directional selection on brain
size in females, but not in males, that would be the expectation, yet the authors report that males
have bigger brain then females – it is exactly the opposite! The authors should try to add a bit of

1) The manuscript presents data on endocranial volume in red deer and aims to
establish whether endocranial volume is (1) heritable and (2) is associated with
differential fitness. If animals with larger endocrianial cavity have higher fitness,
then endocranial cavity and hence brain size is under selection. The study takes
advantage of a long-term study of red deer with known pedigrees. Evolution of
the brain size has lately received lots of attention, both positive and critical and
so the question of the current study is of considerable interest to behavioral and
cognitive biologists.
>>> We are glad you think this work is of considerable interest!
2) The results of heritability of the cranial volume seem solid, yet the results and
conclusions about the fitness associations are not.
My main criticism is the incorrect statistical methods. First, the authors use
residuals from a regression between endocrinal volume and jaw length in
separate analyses. The use of residuals has been criticized numerous times as it
leads to spurious results (see Darlington and Smulders, 2001, Anim. Behav. 62:
599-602; but there are many others). The authors should re-do their analyses
and include absolute endocranial volume and jaw length as two independent
variables in the same analyses.
Second, using residuals produced by the endocranial volume and jaw length and
jaw length in the same analyses is a textbook example of violation of
independence – the same variable is used twice as independent. The bottom line
is that all analyses testing whether longevity, fecundity, life-time breeding
success and life-time reproductive success must be re-done correctly by using
absolute endocranial volume and jaw length as two independent variables.
>>> We recognize that there are divergent opinions about how to account for
body size when investigating endocranial volume variation (see Sol et al. 2008
Am Nat for the variation we used in the main text), which is why we provided
Supplementary Table S3 that gives the outputs from two alternative model
scenarios. One of these alternatives is precisely the scenario you suggest (i.e.,
fitness~EV+JL, for the fitness, fecundity, and longevity response variables for
both sexes). We swapped this scenario with the one in the main text so the
model you suggest is in the main text and the model that was previously in the
main text is now in the supplementary material. Both of these scenarios arrive at
the same conclusions, therefore the Results and Discussion sections in the main
text did not change. The changes in the main text are in Tables 3 and 4, in the
section titled “Relative endocranial volume” and the section titled “Selection
analysis”. The changes in the Supplementary Material are in Supplementary
Tables S3 and S7. We are obviously concerned that the referee had missed the
reference to the alternative models in the Supplementary Information, and so
have tried to flag them more clearly in the “Relative endocranial volume” section.
3) Given a fairly large sample size, the significance level of currently presented
results are really small – P = 0.02 and 0.03. This suggests really small effect
size, which also needs to be reported.
>>> The effect sizes are smaller for endocranial volume than for jaw length and
the effect sizes for both variables are very small as indicated by the Estimate
columns in Tables 3 and 4 and from a visual interpretation of the relationships in
Figures 1 and 2 (p-values do not give clear effect sizes: Sullivan & Feinn 2012 J
Grad Med Edu). We now include this in the discussion (lines 274-275).
4) Age of animals at the time of death (when the skull was extracted) needs to be
included as a variable in all analyses of fitness as a function of endocranial
volume because it changes with age.
>>> Endocranial volume stopped increasing at 3 years of age (at death), which
was the age we classified individuals as adults (section titled ‘Age related
variation in endocranial volume’ and Supplementary Figure S2). Therefore,
endocranial volume variation as a function of age should not confound the fitness
analyses because only adults were included in these analyses.
5) Finally, there were no significant associations between the endocrinal volume
and fitness in males, yet the authors conclude that larger endocranial volume
‘…confers advantages’. But it is not at all clear why this association is only true in
females, but not males. Given large sample size and seemingly small effect size,
these results do not provide convincing evidence that brain size is important for
fitness in this species. Given that jaw size is a highly significant predictor of all
fitness parameters, my suspicion is that when the analyses are re-done correctly,
the effect of endocranial volume on fitness will disappear.
>>> The revised analyses (using endocranial volume + jaw length as explanatory
variables) reach the same conclusions as originally reported, indicating that
endocranial volume has effects in addition to jaw length for females. Please see
our response to comment 2 for more details. We do not know why this
relationship was only significant in females and not males, but we speculate that
it could have something to do with potential trade offs males might incur from
needing to grow and fight with large antlers. This may put an upper growth limit
on endocranial volume. It could also have something to do with male expenditure
on reproduction during the rut. We note this in the discussion (lines 300-305).
6) Also, a lot of statistical methods seem like a giant fishing expedition with a
goal to support what is viewed important. Dropping variables resembles much
criticized step-wise regression. The authors should think critically about which
variables are biologically important and use them all.
>>> All of the variables in the full model were those we deemed biologically
important. We ran the animal model on a reduced version of the full model to
ensure we obtained the variances after accounting for only those independent
variables for which there was statistical support for them being related to
endocranial volume variation. This is standard practice because it gives a model
that is more focused because it eliminates variables that are not likely to need to
be accounted for, and avoids an unnecessarily over-parameterised model.
Running the animal model on a simpler version of the full model also provides
the advantage of improving the interpretability of the results. Model reductions
were not performed for any of the other models in the manuscript.
We confirmed that conclusions did not differ between the full models and
reduced models by running the animal model on the full models for the all-ages
and adult-only versions. In the full model animal models, all fixed effects were in
the same direction (except for the all ages model Mothers Location at Parturition
Laundry Greens) and had similar estimates as the reduced models, and all
random effects explained the variance in endocranial volume within the 95%
confidence intervals of the reduced models. We list the outputs from the full
model animal models here.

7) In the presented manuscript Logan et al. describe the results of a large study
on the relationship between endocranial volumes and aspects of fitness and
heritability in the famous Isle of Rum red deer. The authors compiled an
impressive data set and the statistics are explained excellently. The data is not
oversold and the conclusions seem justified. As such I enjoyed reading the paper
and am sure others will as well. However, I have a few points that I think should
be addressed.
>>> Thank you!
8) Line 13 I think that the niche for this manuscript is bigger than what this
sentence makes it looks like. The fact that no one has shown a microevolutionary
relationship between brain size and longevity in mammals seems like a weak
justification for investigating it. I recommend pitching it broader and extending the
(surprisingly short) abstract accordingly.
>>> Thank you for your encouragement to broaden our scope. We agree that it is
not simply that this is the first study in a wild mammal that makes this study
important – it is more broadly what this study means about how we can test the
cross-species hypotheses. That is, we were able to conduct the first tests of
these hypotheses because we studied these relationships at the within-species
level in a wild mammal. We expand on this point in several places throughout the
abstract, introduction, and discussion.
9) Line 72 This citation is a paper on bird endocranial volume. What is the
evidence that endocranial volume is also a good predictor of mammal, even deer
actual brain size? This is quite an important aspect and it should be clarified that
the proxy used is adequate.
>>> There is evidence from primates that, across species, endocranial volume
tightly correlates with brain mass (Isler et al. 2008), however we are not aware of
any within-species correlations in mammals, which is why we relied on the bird
citation.
The cross-species correlations that have generated hypotheses about why
brain sizes vary rely on both endocranial volume measurements and brain mass
measurements (e.g., Roth & Dicke 2005, Isler et al. 2008, Isler & van Schaik
2009). Therefore, even though the within-species relationship between
endocranial volume and brain mass is unknown in red deer, we used the same
type of data that went into many of the analyses in the cross-species studies,
which makes the results comparable because the same assumptions are being
made. In a sense, it does not matter whether endocranial volume tracks brain
size because endocranial volume because many of the cross-species
comparisons base their conclusions on endocranial volume data.
We now include the reference to Isler et al. 2008 to demonstrate the
likelihood that this relationship also applies within species of mammals and we
discuss the fact that we used the same type of data that were used in many
cross-species comparisons (lines 79-82).
10) Line 85 This is another (maybe the most) critical step: How sure is it that jaw
length is a good enough indicator of body size? What other factors influence jaw
length? Here is an alternative physiological scenario:
High testosterone is known to increase jaw size (not only in humans, but in
several vertebrates) – leading to relatively smaller brains than if normalized for
body size. High levels of testosterone also generally decrease longevity and
fecundity/fitness (at least in humans, so potentially also in red deer) – this would
lead to the same result: seemingly smaller relative brains (because larger jaws)
coincide with decreased life span and fitness.
It would be great if the authors could address this issue.
>>> Jaw length tightly correlated with the other potential body size measures we
explored: skull length (Pearson’s r=0.97, n=541 females; and r=0.98, n=534
males, p<0.001 in both cases) and hind leg length (Pearson’s r=0.85, n=107
females and r=0.87, n=84 males, p<0.001 in both cases). This suggests that the
body size measures available to us in this dataset were interchangeable.
Therefore, either testosterone (or other potential influences) does not influence
jaw length in this species, or if testosterone does influence jaw length then it
likely has similar influences on the other body size measures, which means we
would be unable to eliminate this confound in our dataset. We chose jaw length
because it had the largest sample size of the three potential body size options.
We now emphasise the tight correlations among body size measures in the
methods (lines 100-105).
11) Line 262 But the Tsuboi et al. paper did show a negative association
between brain and gut.
>>> Thanks for pointing this out. We can see how the order in which we
presented the citations in the text confused the message so we re-ordered them
to ensure that only the Walsh reference is interpreted as finding no brain-gut
association (lines 284-287).
12) Figure 1 It is evident that a lot of males do not father a single offspring. It
might be worth exploring the data set without those unsuccessful males.
Potentially, also comparing endocranial volumes between successful and
unsuccessful males. But maybe that is the topic of an upcoming manuscript?
>>> The males in this species are typified by high reproductive skew, which is
why we thought it was important to include all adult males in their reproductive
prime in the analyses, including the males that sired no offspring. This reflects
the natural variation of reproductive success in this population, and we believe it
would not be representative to restrict the analysis to only a subset of the data.
Since the fecundity analyses restrict comparisons to males in their reproductive
prime, we eliminated confounds due to age, which might have explained why
some of the males had no offspring. We hadn’t planned to go in more detail
because we wanted to keep a tight focus on our main questions.
13) Figure 1A & 2 C - I acknowledge that the associations are statistically
significant, but seeing the raw data like this is not convincing.
>>> We changed from showing plots of the raw data to showing partial residual
plots that show the residual variance accounted for after controlling for other
variables in the model (Figs 1 and 2). The only exception is for Figure 1D, which
used a GLMM rather than a GLM because random effects impede the ability to
make partial residual plots, therefore we kept the standard plot here. The partial
residual plots do not make the plots more convincing as they are almost identical
to the previous plots, but they are more representative of the models. The large
amount of scatter in the plots is likely due to the small effect endocranial volume
has on the response variables, which we now mention per our response to
comment 3.
Appendix B
Dear Andrew Dunn, Kevin Padian, and reviewers 1 and 2,
We are grateful for your acceptance of our manuscript (RSOS-160622) pending one
minor revision. We revised the manuscript according reviewer 1’s comment and we
provide our response below (marked by ‘>>>’ and in italics). We have now numbered the
references per Royal Society formatting requirements.
We look forward to seeing this manuscript published in Royal Society Open Science!
Sincerely yours,
Corina Logan (on behalf of all co-authors)
Reviewer 1
1) The revised manuscript is much improved and all my comments have been addressed
well.
>>> Thank you for taking the time to check our revision! We are glad that you feel we
sufficiently addressed your comments.
2) My only minor suggestion is to include some discussion of how the authors think
selection may affect brain size when the effect is only present in females. Would it be
expected then that females should have larger brain relative to body size than males? If
there is directional selection on brain size in females, but not in males, that would be the
expectation, yet the authors report that males have bigger brain then females – it is
exactly the opposite! The authors should try to add a bit of discussion about this.
>>> Thank you for this additional point for the discussion – this question has come up in
conversations so it will be good to include in the paper. To address this, we have added
the following text to the discussion (L294-301):
“The observation of positive selection in females but not in males might lead us to expect
that females should have larger relative brain sizes than males – the opposite of the
observed sexual dimorphism. We speculate that this apparent contradiction indicates the
presence of unknown trade-offs or constraints shaping the evolutionary trajectories of
brain size in either sex. In an analogous situation, antler size was heritable and positively
associated with lifetime breeding success in this population, but showed no evolutionary
response over time, providing another example of the joint occurrence of heritability and
selection on a trait without an evolutionary response [22].”
Reviewer 2
3) I am satisfied with the answers.
