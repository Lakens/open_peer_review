In this manuscript, the authors synthesized a polyamine type chelating resin for adsorption of
heavy metal ions in solution. The resin was synthesized by surface-initiated ATRP, followed by
amination between amine and GMA. Chemical structure of the resin and its adsorption behavior
were characterized. Although the experiments were well performed, the authors should address
the following issues before this manuscript can be further considered.
1. The authors claimed a hyperbranched structure, which is a basic hypothesis of this study.
However, the amination between a polyGMA and trifunctional amine should lead to a
crosslinked structure, instead of hyperbranching. Please explain.
2. In section 2.3, temperature meter should be thermometer. “A certain amount” should be
specified, as it is critical for anyone who wants to reproduce the experiment. The weight of the
resin should be specified as well.
3. What is the purpose of SEM morphology? How does that correlate to the material
performance?
4. Some minor typos. In caption of Figure 3, there are two CMPS. In line 92, GD should be DG?

Dear editor,
The authors reported that polyamine-type chelating resin prepared by combining ATRP
technology and hyperbranched polymer principle and investigated the adsorption performance
to different heavy metal ionsof the material. The manuscript can be published in this journal after
revisions:
1. In the text, there are some grammar errors, please carefully check them and make some
corrections.
2. In this article, some units of the constants including Freundlich constant etc. should be added.
3. The real water sample maybe contain not only one kind of heavy metal ionsbut a mixture of
them, the adsorption performance to the mixed heavy metal ions, i.e., the mixture of As(V),
Cr(VI), Cu(II), Pb(II), Cd(II) and Cr(<U+2162>) may also should be investigated.The more references such
as " Polym. Chem., 2016, 7, 3643";" ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2015, 7, 6733"; “Journal of
Materials Chemistry C, 2017, 5: 6929”, “Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, 2017, 17,
3786.”, “Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, 2016, 27: 5592.”,“Chemistry-A
European Journal, 2016, 22: 8864”, “Composites Part A, 2017, 101: 237”can be cited to highlight
the theme.
4. What’s the size of the CMPS observed from the SEM, besides, a more detailed description of
the SEM characterization should be presented. What’s the inner structure of the materials<U+FF1F>A
TEM characterization should be added to make it clear.
Therefore, my suggestion for this study is minor revision.

Title: Preparation of novel polyamine-type chelating resin with
hyperbranched structures and its adsorption performance
Authors: Youning Chen, Li Chenxi, Huan Wang, Wei Zhao,Yuhong Li
Dear editor,
Thank you and the reviewers for the comments concerning to our
manuscript (RSOS-171665) and giving us a chance to re-submit.
According to your and the reviewers’ suggestions, we have significantly
revised our manuscript. The detail responses to the reviewer’s comments
are as follows:
To reviewer 1
Q. 1. The authors claimed a hyperbranched structure, which is a basic
hypothesis of this study. However, the amination between a polyGMA
and trifunctional amine should lead to a crosslinked structure, instead of
hyperbranching. Please explain.
Response: There are many epoxy groups in polyGMA, which can react
with the amine groups of (2-amino-ethyl) triamine to form hyperbranched
polymers with multi-functional groups.
Q. 2. In section 2.3, temperature meter should be thermometer. “A certain
amount” should be specified, as it is critical for anyone who wants to
reproduce the experiment. The weight of the resin should be specified as
well.
Response: The revised manuscript has been modified.Thank you very
much.
Q. 3. What is the purpose of SEM morphology? How does that correlate
to the material performance?
Response: In order to verify the reactions, SEM was utilized to observe
the shape and appearance of the resin before and after ATRP and
amination reaction.
Q. 4. Some minor typos. In caption of Figure 3, there are two CMPS. In
line 92, GD should be DG?
Response: The revised manuscript has been modified. Thank you very
much.
To reviewer 2
Q. 1. In the text, there are some grammar errors, please carefully check
them and make some corrections.
Response: We have been carefully checked the paper and some grammar
errors have been corrected in the revised manuscript.
Q. 2. In this article, some units of the constants including Freundlich
constant etc. should be added.
Response: The units of some constants have been added in the revised
manuscript.
Q. 3. The real water sample maybe contain not only one kind of heavy
metal ions but a mixture of them, the adsorption performance to the
mixed heavy metal ions, i.e., the mixture of As(V), Cr(VI), Cu(II), Pb(II),
Cd(II) and Cr(<U+2162>) may also should be investigated.The more references
such as " Polym. Chem., 2016, 7, 3643";" ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,
2015, 7, 6733"; “Journal of Materials Chemistry C, 2017, 5: 6929”,
“Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, 2017, 17, 3786.”, “Journal
of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, 2016, 27:
5592.”,“Chemistry-A European Journal, 2016, 22: 8864”, “Composites
Part A, 2017, 101: 237”can be cited to highlight the theme.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. Adsorption selectivity has
been investigated in section 3.4. The mixture of As(V), Cr(VI), Cu(II),
Pb(II), Cd(II) and Cr(<U+2162>) will be investigated in our future research.We
have read above references carefully, and some references have been
cited in the revised manuscript.
Q. 4. What’s the size of the CMPS observed from the SEM, besides, a
more detailed description of the SEM characterization should be
presented. What ’ s the inner structure of the materials <U+FF1F> A TEM
characterization should be added to make it clear.
Response: The size of the CMPS is about 2µm. A more detailed
description of the SEM characterization has been presented in the revised
manuscript. In this paper,chloromethylated polystyrene (CMPS) resin
used as the base materials, the new technology of surface-initiated atom
transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) in macromolecular chemistry
adopted, the functional monomer directly grafted on the surface of CMPS
resin and subquently chemical modification.So the surface properties of
the resin are more important.
