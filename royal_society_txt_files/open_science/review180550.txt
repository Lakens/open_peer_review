Dear authors,
recently I agreed to review the named paper. There is one severe issue about this paper that
hampers me to provide a review. In 2017 a paper with a very similar topic from my group has
been published in Journal of Biomechanics (see attachment; sloped walking on a ramp at different
inclinations, but just one speed) and I am actually quite surprised that this has not been
considered in the manuscript. Our paper is assessed to be essential for covering the current
knowledge of the literature on this topic. The new aspect of your paper are the differentiation
regarding three different walking speeds and walking on an instrumented treadmill. From my
point of view the manuscript has to be revised regarding this aspect as the entire "story" has to be
adjusted to the new knowledge we brought in with our paper. I am more than happy to review
the resubmission of the paper after revision.

Lower extremity (leg) muscles do positive and negative mechanical work when individuals walk
at a constant speed over level ground. Since human walking is a cyclic motion, the overall energy
state of the body remains constant at the same instance within any gait cycle relative to the same
instance in any other gait cycle. Since walking on a level surface at a constant average velocity
results in no net change in the mechanical energy state of the body, one would expect the net
mechanical work of the lower extremity joints to equal zero. Walking at a faster rate on level
3
ground demands increased muscular work but still results in zero net work over an entire gait
cycle.
Walking up a slope increases the body's energy state by increasing potential energy while
walking down a slope decreases the body's potential energy and thus overall energy state.
(treadmill walking mimics this relationship by doing positive or negative work on the body
which must be overcome by positive work or dissipated by negative muscle work.
The authors have conducted a study to determine if walking speed and surface slope interact in a
manner that will elicit unanticipated changes to the typical (level surface) work contributions of
the hip, knee and ankle joints. In addition, the authors also wish to determine if slope or speed
alone will change the relative work contributions of each lower extremity joint. The goal of the
manuscript is to provide guidance and insight in to the future designs of biomimetic prostheses
and orthoses. In summary, this is a very cool idea and a topic that readers should very much
enjoy.
However, the manuscript fails to convey a compelling theoretical scientific foundation for the
study - this reviewer attempted to provide a simple example above. As a result, the manuscript
reads more like a dissertation tirade - reviewing copious somewhat related articles and a
cornucopia of results and statistics. The authors conclude "assistive devices will require dynamic
changes in positive and negative work." without in the least way defining or indicating what is a
"dynamic change" - which one would presume is the overall purpose of the manuscript.
Figure 3 is by far the most interesting and telling figure in the manuscript.
The key findings which should be presented first, appear to be:
1) Increased walking requires increased positive joint work.
2) Walking at an increased grade (+) requires an increase in positive work with little increase in
negative work and the ankle appears to be the primary generator of the positive work. This
makes sense since the limb must overcome the negative work of the treadmill as it attempts to
lower the body.
3) Walking at a decreasing grade (-) requires an increase in negative work with little to no
increase in positive work and the knee joint with assistance from the ankle joint.
The net negative work makes sense since the treadmill is attempting to raise the body (do
positive work) which must be dissipated by negative joint work. Perhaps this is what the authors
meant when they suggested prosthetic devices require dynamic control. The exciting findings is
that the body compensates differently for each condition.
Regarding Figure 3, one would expect the negative and positive net-work values to be a
transposed reflection where -9 negative values would be equal and opposite to +9 positive
values. Yet the negative values are consistently less negative than their positive counterparts are
positive. This is also reflected in the overall net-work data which suggests a significant level of
net positive work must be generated during stance to walk on level grade and even a -3 slope.
Leading to the following observations.
From a technical standpoint, the authors have overlooked a critical factor that would be expected
to contribute substantially to the results indicated in figure 3 and future design of lower extremity
assistive devices. Recent evidence indicates the distal foot does primarily negative work on the
leg and this work effectively cancels positive work produced by the ankle joint. Since lower
extremity prosthetic and orthotic components customarily contain an ankle and foot component,
the work done by the foot component must be considered when determining the net-work done
by the lower extremity (Takahashi 2017, and related articles). The current purpose of the
manuscript warrants the inclusion of distal foot work.
4
In addition, the authors used an instrumented treadmill to collect these data. These devices
produce notoriously inaccurate estimates of the Center of Pressure (COP) - which is an important
term for calculating joint moments and thus joint powers and work levels. If the COP are biased
towards one end of the treadmill (which they often are) one would expect moments walking up
the treadmill to be different from moment calculations when a subject is walking down grade on
the treadmill (in the reverse direction). A simple test of having subject walk at the same speed in
different directions on the treadmill would provide an excellent comparison of joint moment
values. The article should contain a statement indicating the accuracy of the treadmill was
evaluated and sufficient.
In summary, the authors are encouraged to establish a theoretical foundation for the proposed
effort that would form a compelling and interesting article for the intended audience - non-
biomechanists.
Dramatically reduce the current plethora of findings and focus on the most interesting and
important findings.
Provide an indication that the foundational measures are accurate and reliable in order to provide
the readers an assurance that the data are worth interpreting.
Finally, address the contribution of distal foot work and how it may inform future technology
designs.

r extremity (leg) muscles do positive and negative mechanical work when individuals walk

gy state of the body remains constant at the same instance within any gait cycle relative to
ame instance in any other gait cycle. Since walking on a level surface at a constant
age velocity results in no net change in the mechanical energy state of the body, one
d expect the net mechanical work of the lower extremity joints to equal zero. Walking at a
r rate on level ground demands increased muscular work but still results in zero net work
an entire gait cycle.
or Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her thorough review. The point made that the
med net mechanical work of the lower extremity joints should be zero during level walking
constant speed over a stride has not been confirmed in previous studies. Franz 2012

net positive mechanical work performed while walking at a steady speed on level ground

mics (and summed all joint work for an individual leg) to calculate center of mass work

king up a slope increases the body's energy state by increasing potential energy while
ing down a slope decreases the body's potential energy and thus overall energy state.
dmill walking mimics this relationship by doing positive or negative work on the body which
t be overcome by positive work or dissipated by negative muscle work.
or Response: As noted above, center of mass work is not zero for level ground walking
previous studies have found that summed joint work is not equal to zero for level ground
ing [i.e. Zelik 2015]. Thus, the net energy gained or lost when walking on slopes may not

goal of the manuscript is to provide guidance and insight in to the future designs of

ers should very much enjoy.
ever, the manuscript fails to convey a compelling theoretical scientific foundation for the
y - this reviewer attempted to provide a simple example above. As a result, the manuscript
s more like a dissertation tirade - reviewing copious somewhat related articles and a
ucopia of results and statistics.
or Response: We appreciate the reviewer’s opinion regarding the background information
ented in the manuscript. We modified Lines 53-55, 66-70, 107-113 and 124-127 to better
e the background information to the research question and purpose of the study. We have
provided a goal, as suggested, that clearly establishes a theoretical foundation for the
gn and development of biomimetic assistive devices. We added the following statement to
s 164-165 “Thus, our overall goal was to provide guidance and insight in to the future
gns of biomimetic prostheses and orthoses.”
authors conclude "assistive devices will require dynamic changes in positive and negative
." without in the least way defining or indicating what is a "dynamic change" - which one
d presume is the overall purpose of the manuscript.
or Response: Thank you for this comment; we now define “dynamic change”. We adjusted
entence in the conclusion (Lines 624-628) to read: “Thus, in order to replicate biological
e, knee and hip function over a range of speeds and slopes, prosthetic or assistive devices
equire dynamic (constantly changing) control of positive work production and negative
absorption as these vary within the stance phase, as well as dynamic control of peak
ents, powers, and range of motion.”.
e 3 is by far the most interesting and telling figure in the manuscript.
ey findings which should be presented first, appear to be:
reased walking speed requires increased positive joint work.
alking at an increased grade (+) requires an increase in positive work with little increase in
ive work and the ankle appears to be the primary generator of the positive work. This
s sense since the limb must overcome the negative work of the treadmill as it attempts to
the body.
alking at a decreasing grade (-) requires an increase in negative work with little to no
ase in positive work and the knee joint with assistance from the ankle joint.
et negative work makes sense since the treadmill is attempting to raise the body (do
ve work) which must be dissipated by negative joint work. Perhaps this is what the
rs meant when they suggested prosthetic devices require dynamic control. The exciting
gs is that the body compensates differently for each condition.
r Response: Yes, this is exactly what we were implying when we suggest that prosthetic
es need to have dynamic control. We have added a statement to the discussion section
rify this point (Lines 598-601). We have also added a summary of the key findings (Lines
20).
rding Figure 3, one would expect the negative and positive net-work values to be a
posed reflection where -9 negative values would be equal and opposite to +9 positive
s. Yet the negative values are consistently less negative than their positive counterparts
ositive. This is also reflected in the overall net-work data which suggests a significant
of net positive work must be generated during stance to walk on level grade and even a -
pe. Leading to the following observations.
r Response: As stated previously, our net mechanical work results at all slopes are in line
ranz 2012, DeVita 2007, and Zelik 2015.
a technical standpoint, the authors have overlooked a critical factor that would be
cted to contribute substantially to the results indicated in figure 3 and future design of
extremity assistive devices. Recent evidence indicates the distal foot does primarily
ive work on the leg and this work effectively cancels positive work produced by the ankle
Since lower extremity prosthetic and orthotic components customarily contain an ankle
oot component, the work done by the foot component must be considered when
mining the net-work done by the lower extremity (Takahashi 2017, and related articles).
urrent purpose of the manuscript warrants the inclusion of distal foot work.
r Response: We thank the reviewer for this observation. While we do not dispute recent
es investigating distal foot work, the purpose of the current manuscript is to identify lower
ankle, knee, and hip joint contributions (as opposed to segmental contributions) for use in
nced knee and ankle-foot prosthetic design. We are not using our results to inform the
n of new prosthetic foot segments, but have calculated the positive, negative, and net
done over a joint during walking under various conditions to inform the design and control
ee and ankle prostheses.
dition, the authors used an instrumented treadmill to collect these data. These devices
uce notoriously inaccurate estimates of the Center of Pressure (COP) - which is an
rtant term for calculating joint moments and thus joint powers and work levels. If the COP
iased towards one end of the treadmill (which they often are) one would expect moments
ng up the treadmill to be different from moment calculations when a subject is walking
grade on the treadmill (in the reverse direction). A simple test of having subject walk at
ame speed in different directions on the treadmill would provide an excellent comparison
nt moment values. The article should contain a statement indicating the accuracy of the
mill was evaluated and sufficient.
or Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. We zeroed the treadmill in
een each trial to minimize drift in the force and COP data, and have added a statement to
y this in the methods section (Lines 199-202).
mmary, the authors are encouraged to establish a theoretical foundation for the proposed
that would form a compelling and interesting article for the intended audience - non-
echanists.
atically reduce the current plethora of findings and focus on the most interesting and
rtant findings.
or Response: We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback. We have reduced the number of
cted results (now Lines 418-441) detailed in the manuscript, and provide supplementary
s that report our comprehensive data set. We also included statements in the introduction
s 53-55, 66-70, 107-113, 124-127, 129-133, 153-156, 164-165) to better justify and
de a theoretical foundation for our study. We state what is known about biological joint
tation to different walking conditions and how the results of our study provides valuable
mation for the design of biomimetic prostheses and orthoses.
de an indication that the foundational measures are accurate and reliable in order to
de the readers an assurance that the data are worth interpreting.
or Response: As mentioned above, we zeroed the treadmill in between each trial to
mize drift in force and COP data and have added the following statement to the methods
on (Lines 199-202), “Between each trial, we zeroed the treadmill to account for any
ntial drift in the force transducers. By accounting for drift in the force transducers, we
red that force magnitude and center of pressure values were as accurate as possible to
inverse dynamics calculations.”
ly, address the contribution of distal foot work and how it may inform future technology
ns.
or Response: Again, we thank the reviewer for this observation. As mentioned above:
we do not dispute recent studies investigating distal foot work, the purpose of the current
uscript is to identify joint contributions (as opposed to segment contributions) for use in
nced knee and ankle-foot prosthetic design. We are not using our results to inform the
n of new prosthetic foot segments, but have calculated the positive, negative, and net
done over a joint during walking under various conditions to inform the design and control
ee and ankle prostheses.
