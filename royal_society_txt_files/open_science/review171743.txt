The authors have altered basal glucocorticoid level in a wild avian species and examined the
effects on gut microbes. They report a reduction in normal avian gut commensals as well as a
reduction in avian pathogenic bacteria. They explore stress as potentially beneficial in reducing
pathogen levels.
The experiment is nicely planned and outlined.
Minor points:
There is no real discussion regarding the potential mechanism of corticosterone elicited changes
in the microbiota of these birds. How this may act, should be addressed.
Sex and gender haven’t been mentioned here – perhaps gender differences may uncover
significant differences in their data
Is there a nest effect?
Major points
Heat maps are employed to show differences at the different taxonomic levels however no
significance is attached. – it would be useful to see significant differences for the experiment.
Correct analysis would include the PCA /PCoA plots of microbial diversity to determine if the
groups actually separate. Reductions in numbers may or may not be significant.
It would be useful to see this data in S1 and S2 collated and graphed classically with stats applied

Dear authors
The authors investigated the response of the gut microbiome of wild gull chicks to elevated
corticosterone levels. They used a well-designed experimental approach, using the appropriate
controls, and found a reduction in several bacterial taxa (including potential pathogens) in
response to increased cort levels. The manuscript was well-written and the objectives and results
were presented clearly. Overall, I enjoyed reading the manuscript and believe it to be a valuable
contribution to the field.

Comments
I have one major comment, which is also addressed several times below. The authors base part of
their conclusions on the role of cort in reducing pathogen load in birds (which may be), but only
identify the potentially pathogenic taxa to genus level. Genus level is insufficient to identify
pathogens with certainty, and I have made some rewording suggestions below. If the authors
want to be sure that pathogen loads differ in treatment and control birds, they will need to use
targeted PCR and sequencing for confirmation. Otherwise, using more careful phrasing (e.g.
potential pathogens instead of pathogens) is necessary.
Line 61: What do the authors mean with briefly?
Line 83: (16) -> [16] ?
Line 101: “Sequences were screened to cover the same genetic space” what is meant by genetic
space?
Line 102: “Chimeras were checked with 103 the ‘chimera.uchime’ command in Mothur and were
then removed” add uchime reference
Line 117: Was chick growth (body mass) corrected for size?
Line 134-138: Why is chick age not included in the LMs?
Line 147: OTUs autocorrected to OUTs
Line 149-150: restructure the second part of the sentence. It reads a bit odd.
Line 170: Why are pathogens only identified at genus level? These genera include non-pathogenic
species too. Campylobacter are normal components of the avian gut microbiome, especially in
gulls and birds are main reservoir of the Campylobacter species pathogenic to humans (jejuni
etc). Campylobacter is rarely pathogenic in wild birds. At the least this sentence should be
phrased as potential avian pathogens.
L195-196: I am unsure what the authors mean with ‘a reduction in some components’
L210-211: again, this genus level identification and the sequences may not represent pathogens.

The authors address this at the end of the paragraph, but it should be mentioned earlier on in the
manuscript.
218-219: see previous comment.
237: We do not know if these are important pathogens for gulls.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Rees Kassen):
This paper examines the impact of experimentally-induced stress (via implanted
supplementation with glucocorticoids) impacts the bacterial gut microbiome. The results suggest
that it does, with the main effect being to reduce microbial load. This is certainly an interesting
finding, although the precise mechanisms causing this result remain unclear for the moment.
Nevertheless I think the basic result is interesting and deserving of broader attention. In general,
the two reviewers agree with this assessment, although both identify weaknesses in the results
and interpretation that require revision before acceptance. In particular, there is a need for a
fuller discussion, or a more tempered interpretation, of the bacterial species showing the most
significant responses. As reviewer 2 points out, there is too much variability within bacterial
genera to confidently assign 'pathogen' to the genus level. Additionally, I think reviewer 1 makes
some interesting points about potential sources of variability (gender, nest-to-nest variation, for
example) that deserve some further attention.

Response letter
Reviewer: 1
Major points
C1. Heat maps are employed to show differences at the different taxonomic levels however no
significance is attached. – it would be useful to see significant differences for the experiment.
Correct analysis would include the PCA /PCoA plots of microbial diversity to determine if the
groups actually separate. Reductions in numbers may or may not be significant.
It would be useful to see this data in S1 and S2 collated and graphed classically with stats applied
R1. Perhaps the information showed in Fig. 1b (Heat Maps) was not clear enough. As we
mentioned in the result section, only individual OTUs that significantly differed between
experimental groups (P-adj <0.05) were included in the Heat map. We further included a
detailed description of all individual P-values in the supplementary Table S1, and S2. These
information has been clarified in the result section (Lines 169-170; 177-178) and the Figure
legend (Fig. 1). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, the main results from Table S1 and S2 have
been plotted and incorporated into the manuscript together with stats (see lines 184-186 and
new Fig. 2 and Fig. S5).
Minor points:
C2. There is no real discussion regarding the potential mechanism of corticosterone elicited
changes in the microbiota of these birds. How this may act, should be addressed.
R2. We have expanded the discussion regarding the potential mechanisms through which
increased CORT levels may have affected the chicks’ microbiome (Lines 204-222).
C3. Sex and gender haven’t been mentioned here – perhaps gender differences may uncover
significant differences in their data
R3. We controlled for the sex of the birds in all statistical analyses (see Lines 120, 139, 145, 156).
Moreover, sex-ratio (i.e. number of males/females) did not differ between experimental groups
(GLM with Binomial error distribution; Wald <U+03C7>2= 0.505, DF=1, p=0.477; Lines 81-82). Hence, it is
very unlikely that the sex differences may have biased or significantly impacted our results.
C4. Is there a nest effect?
R4. This is an interesting question. Unfortunately, we only use one chick per nest (see Method
section) what makes impossible to test such factor.
Reviewer: 2
C1. I have one major comment, which is also addressed several times below. The authors base
part of their conclusions on the role of cort in reducing pathogen load in birds (which may be),
but only identify the potentially pathogenic taxa to genus level. Genus level is insufficient to
identify pathogens with certainty, and I have made some rewording suggestions below. If the
authors want to be sure that pathogen loads differ in treatment and control birds, they will need
to use targeted PCR and sequencing for confirmation. Otherwise, using more careful phrasing
(e.g. potential pathogens instead of pathogens) is necessary.
R1. We thank the reviewer for her valuable advice. As recommended, we have used a more
careful phrasing through the manuscript to clarify that some of the identified genera can only
be considered as ‘potentially’ pathogens (Lines 21, 173, 225, 234, 252). Moreover, we also
included a cautionary note regarding this issue in the discussion section (lines 229-232).
C2. Line 61: What do the authors mean with briefly?
R2. That was a mistake. The word has been removed.
C3. Line 83: (16) -> [16] ?
R3. Done
C4. Line 101: “Sequences were screened to cover the same genetic space” what is meant by
genetic space?
R4. The sentence has been corrected to make it clearer to the readers. With ‘the same genetic
space’ we meant that ‘Sequences were screened to overlap with the same alignment
coordinates, filtered to remove columns without alignment data and then pre-clustered’ (see
Lines 101-102).
C5. Line 102: “Chimeras were checked with 103 the ‘chimera.uchime’ command in Mothur and
were then removed” add uchime reference
R5. Done
C6. Line 117: Was chick growth (body mass) corrected for size?
R6. Body size was not originally taken into account in the analyses of body mass growth. We
have therefore checked whether or not our results changed after controlling for body size (i.e.
by calculating the residuals of body mass regressed on tarsus length; Jacob et al. 1996 OIKOS 77,
61-67). This new analysis provided similar results to those previously reported for body mass
growth (treatment: F1,27=2.659, p=0.115; Age: F1,27=0.080, p=0.775; treatment x age; F1,27=4.541,
p=0.042). This information has been now incorporated into the Methods section (Lines 126-
127).
C7. Line 134-138: Why is chick age not included in the LMs?
R7. LMs did not include chick age because all chicks were sampled at 8 days of age (see Line 72).
C8. Line 147: OTUs autocorrected to OUTs
R8. Done
C9. Line 149-150: restructure the second part of the sentence. It reads a bit odd.
R9. The sentence has been corrected.
C10. Line 170: Why are pathogens only identified at genus level? These genera include non-
pathogenic species too. Campylobacter are normal components of the avian gut microbiome,
especially in gulls and birds are main reservoir of the Campylobacter species pathogenic to
humans (jejuni etc). Campylobacter is rarely pathogenic in wild birds. At the least this sentence
should be phrased as potential avian pathogens.
R10. The SILVA reference alignment (version 123) and its taxonomy do not include microbial
species. We agree with the reviewer that some of the identified OTUs also include non-
pathogenic bacteria because OTUs were built at 97% similarity. Thus, the sentence has been
reworded, so now we only suggest that some of the underrepresented OTUs in the
corticosterone group of birds included ‘potentially’ pathogenic species (see also our response to
C1). In addition, there is considerable debate about whether ~250 bp of a hypervariable region
(V4) of the 16S rRNA gen could accurately discriminate between species within a genus. It has
been shown that some species share a 99% similarity in their 16S (whole gen), whereas others
can differ as much as 5% (Nguyen et al., 2016 Biofilm & Microbiomes 2, 16004).
C11. L195-196: I am unsure what the authors mean with ‘a reduction in some components’
R11. The sentence has been clarified. We meant that our corticosterone treatment affected the
bacterial community composition as suggested by the results of the PCoAs.
C12. L210-211: again, this genus level identification and the sequences may not represent
pathogens. The authors address this at the end of the paragraph, but it should be mentioned
earlier on in the manuscript.
R12. The sentence has been reworded (see also our response to comment C1).
C13. 218-219: see previous comment.
R13. The sentence has been reworded (see also our response to comment C1).
C14. 237: We do not know if these are important pathogens for gulls.
R14. We agree with the reviewer, so we have re-phrased the sentence (see our response to C1).
