This is an important paper because it reveals a new tractable approach to controlling the behavior
of BZ. Furthermore, by focusing their efforts on the BZ liquid marble formulation, the authors
have developed a pathway for control that can be controlled in a modular fashion.
Do the authors have any consideration about what would happen if microdroplets were frozen
(e.g., Wang et al 2016 EPJ)? The ratio of change in length scale would be notably larger and could
be sufficient to toggle information transmission between inhibitory coupling and activating
coupling.
Have the authors attempted to combine this method with photosensitive BZ? Can other input
methods be used at the same time as freezing?
Oscillations look more irregular after freezing. How does this impact the potential to use
freezing/frozen liquid marbles in a computational circuit?
How does freezing affect the longevity of oscillatory behavior in LMs? That is, do frozen droplets
oscillate the same number of times as non-frozen LMs?
It would be interesting to see some numbers that describe the variability of LM behavior after
freezing. How consistent and/or predictable is their behavior?
It would also be interesting to see a comparison between the surface simulations and an surface
reconstruction. However, this seems likely to be more appropriate for a subsequent effort.
Simulation code is used, but no link is provided. The authors have shared their code in previous
papers, so this is clearly a simple oversight.

The manuscript entitled “Thermal switch of oscillation frequency in Belousov-Zhabotinsky liquid
marbles” authored by A. Adamatzky, C. Fullarton, T. Draper, N. Philips and B. de Lacy Costello
describes temperature effect on period of oscillations in Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) droplets
coated with polyethylene powder (named here as liquid marbles (LMs)) . Authors claim that this
phenomena can be useful as a control method in information processing devices based on BZ
LMs. As attention towards new unconventional computing methods is growing the topic seems
interesting. The manuscript needs revision before publication. It might be suitable for publication
in Royal Society Open Science upon minor changes
1. In the first section authors mention that “BZ-LMs also provide the possibility for active
transport processes which is not easily possible with vesicles”. It would be helpful if the authors
explain what they mean by active processes in BZ-LMs (and why it is hard to realise with
vesicles) or give at least some literature reference.
2. For implementing some useful computing functionality larger number of the BZ LM’s is
required. With the presented thermal control method I see no possibility of oscillation control of
individual LM’s in an ensemble. Another question is how temperature difference influence
affects mechanical stability of BZ LMs? Do authors expect other problems if the present method is
applied for a structure similar to this from ref. 41? I think it would be fair to the readers to discuss
these and other potential problems with thermal control of BZ LMs.
3. As described in caption of Fig. 2c in this experiment oscillations were induced with a silver
wire. Please add information about purpose of silver wire stimulation to Methods section.
4. In Fig. 3d it would be helpful if the moments of time at which Peltier was on and off are also
marked (as in Fig 3a with * and # symbols).
5. All the figures would be easier to follow if the time axis are changed to seconds, especially that
all of the times and period in the text are given in seconds.
6. There are some small issues, which I`ve noticed, and which could help the Authors with
polishing the manuscript:
- phrase repetitions
line 36 page 5 “are as follows are analysed”.
Line 43 page 7 “This is is reflected”
- According to caption of Fig.4a it was kept cool until the end of experiment. Why # symbol is
visible at t = 900 s?

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers,
We thank you for your constructive comments, please find updates marked red in the PDF of the paper
and details listed below.
Reviewer: 1
1. Do the authors have any consideration about what would happen if microdroplets were frozen (e.g.,
Wang et al 2016 EPJ)? The ratio of change in length scale would be notably larger and could be sufficient
to toggle information transmission between inhibitory coupling and activating coupling.
Authors:. We have added this as a future challenge in the Discussion as follows
Additional future challenges would include a comparison between a surface simulations and the surface
reconstruction, implementation of experiments on freezing microdroplets, as inspired by
\cite{wang2016configurable}.
2. Have the authors attempted to combine this method with photosensitive BZ? Can other input methods
be used at the same time as freezing?
Authors: We did not attempt in reported experiments, this could be a topic of future studies.
3. Oscillations look more irregular after freezing. How does this impact the potential to use
freezing/frozen liquid marbles in a computational circuit?
Authors: Irregularity of oscillations might add a noisy (or innovation component) well thought in the
application on evolutionary optimisation and learning.
4. How does freezing affect the longevity of oscillatory behavior in LMs? That is, do frozen droplets
oscillate the same number of times as non-frozen LMs?
Authors: We have no evidence that freezing increases longevity of BZ LMs.
5. It would be interesting to see some numbers that describe the variability of LM behavior after freezing.
How consistent and/or predictable is their behavior?
Authors: Yes, indeed, we have in the paper values of standard deviation:
….then we have average $p=44.4$ ($\sigma(p)=12.5$), average $p^*=92$ ($\sigma(p^*)=28.6$) average
$\frac{p^*}{p}=2.1$ ($\sigma(\frac{p^*}{p})=0.5$)
6. It would also be interesting to see a comparison between the surface simulations and an surface
reconstruction. However, this seems likely to be more appropriate for a subsequent effort.
Authors:. We have added this as a future challenge in the Discussion as follows:
Additional future challenges would include a comparison between a surface simulations and the surface
reconstruction.

1. In the first section authors mention that “BZ-LMs also provide the possibility for active transport
processes which is not easily possible with vesicles”. It would be helpful if the authors explain what they
mean by active processes in BZ-LMs (and why it is hard to realise with vesicles) or give at least some
literature reference.
Authors: We have updated the text as follows:
LMs also provide the possibility for active transport processes~\cite{bormashenko2011liquid} which is
not easily possible with vesicles, e.g. manipulating LMs with
magnets~\cite{zhao2010magnetic,zhang2012remotely}, mechanically~\cite{ooi2015manipulation},
electrostatically~\cite{bormashenko2011electrically}, pressure
gradients~\cite{bormashenko2010micropump}, change in pH~\cite{fujii2010ph}.
2. For implementing some useful computing functionality larger number of the BZ LM’s is required.
With the presented thermal control method I see no possibility of oscillation control of individual LM’s in
an ensemble. Another question is how temperature difference influence affects mechanical stability of BZ
LMs? Do authors expect other problems if the present method is applied for a structure similar to this from
ref. 41? I think it would be fair to the readers to discuss these and other potential problems with thermal
control of BZ LMs.
Authors: We have added the following in the Discussion section:
To control frequencies in an ensemble of BZ LMs~\cite{fullarton2018belousov} we can use small Peltier
elements, which size is enough just to fit a single marble, e.g. Peltier Module, 1.3~W, 2.2~A, 0.9~V,
6$\times$6~mm (each of the modules can be automatically controlled via Arduino device).
3. As described in caption of Fig. 2c in this experiment oscillations were induced with a silver wire.
Please add information about purpose of silver wire stimulation to Methods section.
Authors: we added
(reaction starts because a concentration of bromate is reduced locally due to ionisation of silver)
4. In Fig. 3d it would be helpful if the moments of time at which Peltier was on and off are also
marked (as in Fig 3a with * and # symbols).
Authors: Done.
5. There are some small issues, which I`ve noticed, and which could help the Authors with polishing
the manuscript:
- phrase repetitions
line 36 page 5 “are as follows are analysed”.
Line 43 page 7 “This is is reflected”
- According to caption of Fig.4a it was kept cool until the end of experiment. Why # symbol is visible at t
= 900 s?
Authors: corrected.
