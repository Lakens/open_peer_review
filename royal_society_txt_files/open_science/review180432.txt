I found this manuscript well-written and tightly argued. Approaching the manuscript as
someone interested in the history of human-environment interactions but not expert in the
methods used here (oral pathology and inferring ancient diets from stable isotope data), I found
the presentation to be clear, straightforward and convincing. The methods are explained well,
and the results of this study are discussed in the context of other kinds of evidence presented in
previous studies. Many of these previous studies were published in Spanish and in places where
they were probably not widely known, and the way in which they are integrated here is quite
useful. I also appreciate the authors’ efforts not to overstate some of the findings of previous
studies, for example, in stating that results of phytolith analyses are ‘compatible with’
determinations of certain plants, rather than affirming that the results demonstrate that these
particular plants were used.
The manuscript’s message is important, as it shows evidence that some people of the Atlantic
coast of Brazil were intensively managing plants (possibly cultivating them—here again they
resist any tendency to overstate their results) at about the same time as people in Amazonia.
I wonder where they will take this next. An interesting avenue might be to do more work on
phytoliths, and to see if phytoliths offer any clues as to whether plants used were domesticated.
For example, phytoliths of domesticated plants are usually larger than those of their wild
relatives, at least for certain organs.
Below are detailed comments, mostly on matters of form.

Line 40 : change ‘carbohydrate’ to ‘carbohydrates’. Also, here you write ‘pre-ceramic’, whereas in
all other instances in the paper you write ‘preceramic’. Use one or the other, not both. (I would
suggest always using ‘pre-ceramic’)
Lines 42-43 : ‘A diversified economy … took place’ : awkward wording. An economy does not
‘take place.’ I suggest changing to : ‘A diversified economy … was in place’ or something like
that.
Line 44 : ’which supported’ : The antecedent of the pronoun ‘which’ is not clear. ‘economy’ ?
‘shellmound’ ? ‘Babitonga Bay’ ? The problem could be solved by changing the sentence to read :
‘A diversified economy with substantial consumption of plant resources was in place at the
shellmound (or sambaqui) of Morro do Ouro, in Babitonga Bay, and supported a dense
population at ca. 4,500 cal BP.’

References
In titles of journal articles (or of book chapters), you mix two formats—one in which all words in
the title bear an initial capital (references 2, 3, 10, 12, 24, 33, 34, 35, 38, 42, 62, 64, 69), and another
in which only the first word (and proper nouns) bear an initial capital (like references 1 and 4). I
think the second format is correct.
Reference 12 : a symbol appears not to have printed correctly between ‘food’ and ‘production’ in
the second line of the reference.
References 40, 41 and 45 : ‘Streptococcus mutans’ should be in italics.
Figures : I think that some symbols (the symbol for ‘delta’ ?) have not printed correctly in the
captions of Figures 3 and 4, as indicated by unusual extra spaces between the opening
parenthesis and ‘13Cap’, for example.

The beginning of food-producing economies is one of the most debated topics in the archaeology
of the Americas. The paper by Pezo-Lanfranco et al al. represents a novel and significant
contribution from oral pathology and stable isotope analyses. The results showing and stable
isotope evidence for unexpectedly high consumption of carbohydrate by Middle Holocene pre-
ceramic coastal foragers of the Atlantic Forest of South America adds a substantial contribution to
this debate. This is particularly so, since this region of lowland South America is an area that has
traditionally been viewed as peripheral to early centres of food production on the continent and
until now only a few archaeobotanical studies have suggested the presence of cultivated or
domesticated plants. I wonder to what extent the authors want to include in their discussion the
data from the inland site of Corondo (Scheel-Ybert and Dias 2007) in their discussion of early
food-production in the region. A map or chart showing the sites and documented plants in the
region will also facilitate the non-South-American readers to understand the regional context. The
paper is well-written, clear-structured, and illustrations clear and appropriate. I strongly
recommend this paper for publication in the Royal Society Open Science journal.

This paper assesses the importance of plant resources to the diets of Middle Holocene human
populations in the Atlantic Forest of South America. The paper uses oral pathology and dietary
modelling based on stable isotope analysis to address this, concluding that plants were an
important dietary component, which may suggest plant cultivation took place. The paper tackles
an interesting and important topic in archaeological research and is written in a clear and concise
7
manner, making the research accessible to the reader. As per the invitation to review, my focus
has been on the methodological aspects of the paper.
The authors use a Bayesian mixing model in FRUITS to estimate proportions of terrestrial
mammals, plants, and fish in the diet, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data. This, in
combination with the study of oral pathologies, forms the foundation of the paper’s findings. It is
therefore somewhat misleading that this modelling approach is not mentioned in the
manuscript’s abstract. I would recommend this be clarified, as the current abstract suggests that it
is the stable isotope data itself that will be discussed in the text, which it is not.
When reviewing the manuscript, I found that I was mostly reading the SI information. The
information contained in the SI is comprehensive and details the parameters used, and
assumptions made, in the dietary modelling. While I am in full agreement that the place for the
majority of this information is indeed the SI, given that the model out forms such a significant
part of the manuscripts interpretations I do feel that some more information about this
methodology should be contained in section 2.2 (also it’s heading ‘stable carbon and nitrogen
analysis’ is again misleading). This is particularly important as the model output is almost
entirely subject to the input parameters chosen by the author (baseline data, tolerances, etc). A
greater discussion of the limitations and uncertainties of the output should also be included in the
results/discussion section. In sum, I do not disagree with the approach the authors have taken in
the analysis, but it would aid the reader, particularly those not familiar with the approach, if the
key pros/cons/limitations/assumptions could be summarised with the body of the text.
Minor edits:
Page 2, Line 5: remove ‘has’ from ‘production has fuelled’
Page 2, Line 47-48: ‘food production (e.g. low level food production)’…this seems redundant,
could the sentence not simply read ‘low level food production’?
Page 3, Line 21: ‘disease’ not ‘diseases’
Page 3, Line 29: extra bracket after peccary should be removed
Page 3, Line 30: ‘and’ rather than ‘whilst’
Page 4, section 2.3: the first sentence of this paragraph appears in duplicate
Page 4, Lines 51-56: I had to re-read this sentence, perhaps it could be rewritten to improve
clarity?
Page 9, Line 24: ‘A such’ should be ‘Such a’
There is an inconsistent use of ‘detine’ and ‘dentin’ through the paper. Whichever spelling is
used, it should be consistent.
When values are discussed ‘from …% to …%’ it is inconsistent whether the higher or lower
number is listed first. This may just be personal preference, but I would find it easier to read if the
order values are listed in are consistent (e.g. from lower% to higher%)

References
In titles of journal articles (or of book chapters), you mix two formats—one in which all words in
the title bear an initial capital (references 2, 3, 10, 12, 24, 33, 34, 35, 38, 42, 62, 64, 69), and another
in which only the first word (and proper nouns) bear an initial capital (like references 1 and 4). I
think the second format is correct.
Reference 12 : a symbol appears not to have printed correctly between ‘food’ and ‘production’ in
the second line of the reference.
References 40, 41 and 45 : ‘Streptococcus mutans’ should be in italics.
Figures : I think that some symbols (the symbol for ‘delta’ ?) have not printed correctly in the
captions of Figures 3 and 4, as indicated by unusual extra spaces between the opening
parenthesis and ‘13Cap’, for example.

Comments to the Author(s)
The beginning of food-producing economies is one of the most debated topics in the archaeology
of the Americas. The paper by Pezo-Lanfranco et al al. represents a novel and significant
contribution from oral pathology and stable isotope analyses. The results showing and stable
isotope evidence for unexpectedly high consumption of carbohydrate by Middle Holocene pre-
ceramic coastal foragers of the Atlantic Forest of South America adds a substantial contribution to
this debate. This is particularly so, since this region of lowland South America is an area that has
traditionally been viewed as peripheral to early centres of food production on the continent and
until now only a few archaeobotanical studies have suggested the presence of cultivated or
domesticated plants. I wonder to what extent the authors want to include in their discussion the
data from the inland site of Corondo (Scheel-Ybert and Dias 2007) in their discussion of early
food-production in the region. A map or chart showing the sites and documented plants in the
region will also facilitate the non-South-American readers to understand the regional context. The
paper is well-written, clear-structured, and illustrations clear and appropriate. I strongly
recommend this paper for publication in the Royal Society Open Science journal.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper assesses the importance of plant resources to the diets of Middle Holocene human
populations in the Atlantic Forest of South America. The paper uses oral pathology and dietary
modelling based on stable isotope analysis to address this, concluding that plants were an
important dietary component, which may suggest plant cultivation took place. The paper tackles
an interesting and important topic in archaeological research and is written in a clear and concise
manner, making the research accessible to the reader. As per the invitation to review, my focus
has been on the methodological aspects of the paper.
The authors use a Bayesian mixing model in FRUITS to estimate proportions of terrestrial
mammals, plants, and fish in the diet, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data. This, in
combination with the study of oral pathologies, forms the foundation of the paper’s findings. It is
therefore somewhat misleading that this modelling approach is not mentioned in the
manuscript’s abstract. I would recommend this be clarified, as the current abstract suggests that it
is the stable isotope data itself that will be discussed in the text, which it is not.
When reviewing the manuscript, I found that I was mostly reading the SI information. The
information contained in the SI is comprehensive and details the parameters used, and
assumptions made, in the dietary modelling. While I am in full agreement that the place for the
majority of this information is indeed the SI, given that the model out forms such a significant
part of the manuscripts interpretations I do feel that some more information about this
methodology should be contained in section 2.2 (also it’s heading ‘stable carbon and nitrogen
analysis’ is again misleading). This is particularly important as the model output is almost
entirely subject to the input parameters chosen by the author (baseline data, tolerances, etc). A
greater discussion of the limitations and uncertainties of the output should also be included in the
results/discussion section. In sum, I do not disagree with the approach the authors have taken in
the analysis, but it would aid the reader, particularly those not familiar with the approach, if the
key pros/cons/limitations/assumptions could be summarised with the body of the text.
Minor edits:
Page 2, Line 5: remove ‘has’ from ‘production has fuelled’
Page 2, Line 47-48: ‘food production (e.g. low level food production)’…this seems redundant,
could the sentence not simply read ‘low level food production’?
15
Page 3, Line 21: ‘disease’ not ‘diseases’
Page 3, Line 29: extra bracket after peccary should be removed
Page 3, Line 30: ‘and’ rather than ‘whilst’
Page 4, section 2.3: the first sentence of this paragraph appears in duplicate
Page 4, Lines 51-56: I had to re-read this sentence, perhaps it could be rewritten to improve
clarity?
Page 9, Line 24: ‘A such’ should be ‘Such a’
There is an inconsistent use of ‘detine’ and ‘dentin’ through the paper. Whichever spelling is
used, it should be consistent.
When values are discussed ‘from …% to …%’ it is inconsistent whether the higher or lower
number is listed first. This may just be personal preference, but I would find it easier to read if the
order values are listed in are consistent (e.g. from lower% to higher%)

Response to Reviewers
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I found this manuscript well-written and tightly argued. Approaching the
manuscript as someone interested in the history of human-environment
interactions but not expert in the methods used here (oral pathology and
inferring ancient diets from stable isotope data), I found the presentation to
be clear, straightforward and convincing. The methods are explained well, and
the results of this study are discussed in the context of other kinds of evidence
presented in previous studies. Many of these previous studies were published
in Spanish and in places where they were probably not widely known, and the
way in which they are integrated here is quite useful. I also appreciate the
authors’ efforts not to overstate some of the findings of previous studies, for
example, in stating that results of phytolith analyses are ‘compatible with’
determinations of certain plants, rather than affirming that the results
demonstrate that these particular plants were used.
The manuscript’s message is important, as it shows evidence that some
people of the Atlantic coast of Brazil were intensively managing plants
(possibly cultivating them—here again they resist any tendency to overstate
their results) at about the same time as people in Amazonia.
I wonder where they will take this next. An interesting avenue might be to do
more work on phytoliths, and to see if phytoliths offer any clues as to whether
plants used were domesticated. For example, phytoliths of domesticated
plants are usually larger than those of their wild relatives, at least for certain
organs.
Title of the paper : ‘…among preceramic fisheries…’ : Don’t you mean
something like ‘among preceramic fishing peoples’ ? A ‘fishery’ is not a group
of people, it is an activity or system conducted by people.
R: Title changed for “Middle Holocene plant cultivation on the Atlantic
Forest coast of Brazil?”
Line 40 : change ‘carbohydrate’ to ‘carbohydrates’.
R: Corrected.
Also, here you write ‘pre-ceramic’, whereas in all other instances in the paper
you write ‘preceramic’. Use one or the other, not both. (I would suggest
always using ‘pre-ceramic’).
R: Done, in the corrected version one can read pre-ceramic throughout the
manuscript.
Lines 42-43 : ‘A diversified economy … took place’ : awkward wording. An
economy does not ‘take place.’ I suggest changing to : ‘A diversified economy
… was in place’ or something like that.
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 44 : ’which supported’ : The antecedent of the pronoun ‘which’ is not
clear. ‘economy’ ? ‘shellmound’ ? ‘Babitonga Bay’ ? The problem could be
solved by changing the sentence to read : ‘A diversified economy with
substantial consumption of plant resources was in place at the shellmound (or
sambaqui) of Morro do Ouro, in Babitonga Bay, and supported a dense
population at ca. 4,500 cal BP.’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 45 : ‘when compared with other’ : change to ‘when compared with that
of other’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 48 : ‘in dental calculus of the same individuals and stone tool artefacts’ :
change to : ‘in dental calculus of the same individuals and on stone tool
artefacts’
R: The sense was revised for clarification. Now reads: “...such as stone tool
artefacts for plant processing and plant microremains in dental calculus of
the same individuals.”
Line 50: ‘and suggests’: change to ‘and suggest’—the subject of the verb
‘suggest’ is plural (‘results’).
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 51 : ‘in Amazonia and La Plata Basin’ : change to : ‘in Amazonia and the La
Plata Basin’
R: suggestion accepted
Introduction
Page 2, Line 15 : ‘cursory consideration, viewed’ : change to : ‘cursory
consideration, and it is viewed’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 40 : ‘often affected’ : change to : ‘who were often affected’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 48 : delete the semicolon between ‘production’ and the reference in
brackets.
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 52 : ‘Southern’ should be changed to ‘southern’. It is simply an adjective,
not part of a formal name for some political or administrative entity within
Brazil. (same remark, page 4, line 8)
R: Suggestion accepted. “Southern” was changed by “southern” throughout
the text.
Page 3
Line 4 : ‘in La Plata Basin’ : change to : ‘in the La Plata Basin’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 8 : Question of the journal’s style : The Introduction section has only one
numbered subheading (1.1). Shouldn’t there be at least two hierarchically
equivalent subsections ? (i.e., having a ‘1.1’ implies that ‘1.2’ also exists)
R: As indicated in the Authors Guide this is a subtitle. We believe the editor
of RSOS will correct this observation if necessary.
Line 9 : write ‘sambaqui’ either always in italics throughout the manuscript, or
always in normal typeface. You mix the two.
R: The word “sambaquis” is now written in italics throughout the
manuscript.
Line 11 : change ‘population growth and urban development has’ to :
‘population growth and urban development have’ (the subject of the verb is
plural)
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 20 : ‘a key site for discussing’ : I think it would be more precise to change
this to : ‘a key site in discussions of’
R: Suggestion accepted and sentence amended.
Lines 25-29 : It would be good to give the Latin names of all species named, or
have a list of these as an annex in supplementary material (and reference that
annex here). If only generic names are known, these could probably be given
in the text.
R: We included the Latin names in the main text.
Material and methods
Page 4
Lines 31-36 exactly repeat lines 27-31. Delete the repetitive passage.
R: The repetitive passage was deleted.
Results
Page 4
Line 38 : here you write ‘bayesian’, whereas elsewhere in the paper you write
‘Bayesian’. Use one or the other throughout, not both.
R: The word was corrected as suggested. It now reads “Bayesian” through
the text.
Line 55 : ‘older of up to’ : change to : ‘older by up to’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Page 5
Line 21 : Section 3.1 already exists. This should be section 3.2 (and page 6, line
31 should be section 3.3)
R: The numbers were corrected as suggested.
Line 34 : ‘most likely reflects’ : change to : ‘most likely reflect’ (the subject of
the verb ‘reflect’ is plural (‘differences‘)
R: The sentence was corrected as suggested.
Line 35 : ‘rather than population age or sex’ : A population cannot have a sex. I
would suggest changing this to : ‘rather than between-population differences
in age or sex distribution’
R: The sentence was corrected as suggested.
Line 39 : ‘seen only between MO and RCI’ : Do you mean that differences
between RCI and RC2, and between RC2 and MO, were not significant?
R: Revised sentence. Now it reads: “...with statistically significant differences
seen only between MO and RCI (p = 0.0052; differences between RCI and
RC2, and between RC2 and MO were not significant).”
Page 6
Line 21 : ’…(5%); however there were…’ : I would suggest changing to : ’…(5%).
However, there were…’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Line 29 : ‘lesions that were also more frequent’ : change to : ‘lesions, which
were also more frequent’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Lines 46-47 : ‘where the relative contribution of terrestrial mammals and
plants’ : change to : ‘where the relative contributions of terrestrial mammals
and plants’
R: Suggestion accepted.
Page 7
Line 5 : ‘caries lesions’ : shouldn’t this be ‘carious lesions’ ?
R: The word was corrected as suggested.
Line 42 : ‘except for MO59 which’ : shouldn’t the last word be ‘who’, not
which’ ? (Also, put a comma between ‘MO59’ and ‘who’). You are inferring the
diet of a person, not an object or an animal. Also on line 44, I suggest changing
‘most of dietary proteins’ to ‘most of her dietary proteins’
R: The sentence was corrected as suggested.

Line 14 : change ‘marine based’ to ‘marine-based’
R: The phrase was corrected as suggested.
Line 35 : ‘in relation to other sambaquis’ : change to : ‘in relation to diets of

R: The phrase was corrected as suggested.
Line 36 : change ‘with some agriculturalist’ to ‘with diets of some
agriculturalists’
R: The phrase was corrected as suggested.
Line 46 : ‘ground-stones’ : shouldn’t this be ‘grindstones’ ?
R: The word was corrected as suggested.
Page 9, Line 10 : ‘Population exchange between coastal fisheries and groups’ :
change to : ‘Population exchange between coastal fishing peoples and groups’
(a ‘fishery’ is different from the group that practices fishing.)
R: The sentence was corrected as suggested.
Line 22 : ‘A such level of plant dependence’ : change to : ‘Such a level of plant
dependence’
R: The sentence was corrected as suggested.
Line 38 : ‘…cradle of early food production, however the nature, …’ : change in
sentence structure and punctuation : change to : ‘…cradle of early food
production. However, the nature, …’
R: The sentence was corrected as suggested.
Line 39 : change ‘is’ to ‘are’ (subject of the verb is plural)
R: The sentence was corrected as suggested.

Line 12 : change ‘Author’s contribution’ to ‘Authors’ contributions’
R: Corrected as suggested.
Line 25 : ‘…include the stable isotope, the radiocarbon data,…’ : change to :
‘…include the stable isotope and radiocarbon data,…’ OR ‘…include the stable
isotope data, the radiocarbon data,…’
R: Corrected as suggested.
Lines 25-26 : ‘and Bayesian mixing model.’ : shouldn’t this be something like
‘and results of the Bayesian mixing model.’ ?
R: Corrected as suggested.
Line 39 ; ‘Forest, Krista’ : change to : ‘Forest, and Krista’
R: Corrected as suggested.
References
In titles of journal articles (or of book chapters), you mix two formats—one in
which all words in the title bear an initial capital (references 2, 3, 10, 12, 24,
33, 34, 35, 38, 42, 62, 64, 69), and another in which only the first word (and
proper nouns) bear an initial capital (like references 1 and 4). I think the
second format is correct.
R: All the references have been revised and corrected as suggested.
Reference 12 : a symbol appears not to have printed correctly between ‘food’
and ‘production’ in the second line of the reference.
R: This symbol was deleted.
References 40, 41 and 45 : ‘Streptococcus mutans’ should be in italics.
R: Corrected as suggested. Now is in italic.
Figures : I think that some symbols (the symbol for ‘delta’ ?) have not printed
correctly in the captions of Figures 3 and 4, as indicated by unusual extra
spaces between the opening parenthesis and ‘13Cap’, for example.
R: This was an issue with the conversion to PDF. The caption is corrected in
word file.
SI Methods
Page 1
‘coconut palm (Syagrus romanzoffiana)’ : this is not the name of the plant
most commonly known as coconut palm, Cocos nucifera. Is this really the
plant’s common name ? Does it have another ?
R: The common name of this plant is jerivá palm. The text was corrected in
the SI methods
There is noticeable repetition (enough to be slightly irritating) between the
material and methods section of the main text and the SI Methods.
R: We have revised the SI Methods to avoid repetition.

Comments to the Author(s)
The beginning of food-producing economies is one of the most debated topics
in the archaeology of the Americas. The paper by Pezo-Lanfranco et al al.
represents a novel and significant contribution from oral pathology and stable
isotope analyses. The results showing and stable isotope evidence for
unexpectedly high consumption of carbohydrate by Middle Holocene pre-
ceramic coastal foragers of the Atlantic Forest of South America adds a
substantial contribution to this debate. This is particularly so, since this region
of lowland South America is an area that has traditionally been viewed as
peripheral to early centres of food production on the continent and until now
only a few archaeobotanical studies have suggested the presence of cultivated
or domesticated plants. I wonder to what extent the authors want to include
in their discussion the data from the inland site of Corondo (Scheel-Ybert and
Dias 2007) in their discussion of early food-production in the region. A map or
chart showing the sites and documented plants in the region will also facilitate
the non-South-American readers to understand the regional context. The
paper is well-written, clear-structured, and illustrations clear and appropriate.
I strongly recommend this paper for publication in the Royal Society Open
Science journal.
R: We have now included several papers to acknowledge the importance of
Corondo, including Scheel-Ybert and Dias (2007). We have included in the
figure 1 (map of South America) the location of other Middle Holocene sites
with possible evidence of food production in the Atlantic Forest coast.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper assesses the importance of plant resources to the diets of Middle
Holocene human populations in the Atlantic Forest of South America. The
paper uses oral pathology and dietary modelling based on stable isotope
analysis to address this, concluding that plants were an important dietary
component, which may suggest plant cultivation took place. The paper tackles
an interesting and important topic in archaeological research and is written in
a clear and concise manner, making the research accessible to the reader. As
per the invitation to review, my focus has been on the methodological aspects
of the paper.
The authors use a Bayesian mixing model in FRUITS to estimate proportions of
terrestrial mammals, plants, and fish in the diet, using carbon and nitrogen
stable isotope data. This, in combination with the study of oral pathologies,
forms the foundation of the paper’s findings. It is therefore somewhat
misleading that this modelling approach is not mentioned in the manuscript’s
abstract. I would recommend this be clarified, as the current abstract suggests
that it is the stable isotope data itself that will be discussed in the text, which
it is not.
R: The modelling approach has been mentioned in the revised version of the
manuscript.
When reviewing the manuscript, I found that I was mostly reading the SI
information. The information contained in the SI is comprehensive and details
the parameters used, and assumptions made, in the dietary modelling. While I
am in full agreement that the place for the majority of this information is
indeed the SI, given that the model out forms such a significant part of the
manuscripts interpretations I do feel that some more information about this
methodology should be contained in section 2.2 (also it’s heading ‘stable
carbon and nitrogen analysis’ is again misleading). This is particularly
important as the model output is almost entirely subject to the input
parameters chosen by the author (baseline data, tolerances, etc). A greater
discussion of the limitations and uncertainties of the output should also be
included in the results/discussion section. In sum, I do not disagree with the
approach the authors have taken in the analysis, but it would aid the reader,
particularly those not familiar with the approach, if the key
pros/cons/limitations/assumptions could be summarised with the body of the
text.
R: We have now extended the revised version of the manuscript to
accommodate these requests. The materials and methods now include some
parts on the model parameters, however due to the extensive information
on the model we still consider that most of it should be deployed in the SI.
Minor edits:
Page 2, Line 5: remove ‘has’ from ‘production has fuelled’
R: The word was removed as suggested.
Page 2, Line 47-48: ‘food production (e.g. low level food production)’…this
seems redundant, could the sentence not simply read ‘low level food
production’?
R: Corrected as suggested.
Page 3, Line 21: ‘disease’ not ‘diseases’
R: Corrected as suggested.
Page 3, Line 29: extra bracket after peccary should be removed
R: Corrected, bracket deleted.
Page 3, Line 30: ‘and’ rather than ‘whilst’
R: Corrected as suggested.
Page 4, section 2.3: the first sentence of this paragraph appears in duplicate
R: Corrected, sentence deleted.
Page 4, Lines 51-56: I had to re-read this sentence, perhaps it could be
rewritten to improve clarity?
R: Sentence rephrased
Page 9, Line 24: ‘A such’ should be ‘Such a’
R: Corrected as suggested.
There is an inconsistent use of ‘detine’ and ‘dentin’ through the paper.
Whichever spelling is used, it should be consistent.
R: The word was corrected through the text. The word used is dentin.
When values are discussed ‘from …% to …%’ it is inconsistent whether the
higher or lower number is listed first. This may just be personal preference,
but I would find it easier to read if the order values are listed in are consistent
(e.g. from lower% to higher%)
R: Corrected as suggested.
