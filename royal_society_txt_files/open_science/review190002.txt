The manuscript describes in quite a clear way to compare flavor fingerprint, electronic nose, and
multivariate analysis for discrimination of extra virgin olive oils. The research is original and the
information is needed for the field of quality control of olive oils. Nevertheless, there are some
3
detail problems in the manuscript. I suggest that it can be considered for publication after minor
revisions.
Specific comments:
1. Line 96-98: Why were peanut oil, corn oil, and sunflower seed oil selected to prepare the mixed
oil system? It should be explained.
2. Line 109: Why was 4-methyl-2-pentanol selected as the internal standard? It should be
explained.
4. Line 132-133: “Technical Requirements for the Study of Fingerprint of Traditional Chinese
Medicine Injection” should be listed in the “References” section.
5. Line 162: It is better to change “adulteration oils” to “mixed oils”.
6. Line 167-168: Delete the sentence “The number of reference chromatogram was set as S1”.

Dear Editor:
Thank you for your comments concerning this manuscript entitled
“Comparison of flavor fingerprint, electronic nose, and
multivariate analysis for discrimination of extra virgin olive oils”
(Manuscript ID: RSOS-190002). Those comments are all valuable and
very helpful for improving this manuscript. We have studied
comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet
with approval. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to
technical check results are as flowing:
Responds to the referees’ comments:
Referee #1
1. Line 62-63:In introduction; the authors must be clear about their
findings. Avoid the use of suspicious statements using "might be".
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The “might be” was changed
to “is” and marked in red.
2-Line 70-73: Please provide 3-4 references of such studies to
strengthen the statement.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! However, there was no report
on the application of SAFE on flavor compound extract of EVOOs
previously. This statement was based on the preliminary experiments
in our lab, and the results were not published so far. Hence, there is no
relevant reference to be cited. And there might be some
misunderstanding on the expression. So it is more definite that “in
EVOOs” was added in this sentence and marked in red.
3-Line 90-91: please note the brands of EVOOs from three countries.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The brands of EVOOs from
three countries were added and marked in red.
4-Line 100: delete “(CR)”
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The “(CR)” was deleted.
5-Line 109:What is I.S.? Internal standard, I assume. Then, I suggest
rephrasing as "…pentanol was added as an internal standard at the
concentration of…"
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The “I.S.” was deleted, then
the expression was changed to “1 <U+F06D>L of 4-methyl-2-pentanol was
added as an internal standard at a concentration of 200.5 <U+F020><U+F06D>g/<U+F06D>L” and
marked in red.
6-Table 1:the footnote (b) should be in according with the state of Line
129-130.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The footnote (b) in Table 1
was changed according to the state of Line 129-130 and marked in red.
7 –Line 170-171: Whether some references could be provided to
support the statement.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! A reference ([41]) was added
to support the statement and marked in red.
8 –Line 205-207: Please add some significance levels. Result
presentation in abstract should be quantitative.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The RSDs were only applied
to test if the stability of samples, precision of equipment, and
repeatability of experimental satisfied the requirement of fingerprint
establishment. It did not concern the significance analysis, and there
was no significance level.
In addition, the discrimination efficiency of PCA and correlation
coefficient method of fingerprint were added in the section “Abstract”
quantitatively and marked in red.
Referee #2
1. Line 96-98: Why were peanut oil, corn oil, and sunflower seed oil
selected to prepare the mixed oil system? It should be explained.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! For quality control or
authenticity verification of EVOOs, the oils with lower price, light
color and flavor were selected. These three kinds of oils satisfy
requirements above. So they were purchased for the experiment
samples in this study. It was illustrated in the last section of “1.
Introduction” and marked in red.
2. Line 109: Why was 4-methyl-2-pentanol selected as the internal
standard? It should be explained.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! Based on the blank experiment,
4-methyl-2-pentanol did not exist in EVOO samples in this study. And
4-methyl-2-pentanol could be separated from other compounds in the
samples. So it was taken as the internal standard. The illustration was
added in the section “2.3. Aroma extraction of EVOOs using SPME”
and marked in red.
3. Line 126: Change “…250 <U+F0B0>C and 230 <U+F0B0>C…” to “…250 and 230
<U+F0B0>C…”.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The expression was changed to
“…250 and 230 <U+F0B0>C…” and marked in red.
4. Line 132-133: “Technical Requirements for the Study of Fingerprint
of Traditional Chinese Medicine Injection” should be listed in the
“References” section.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! This “Technical Requirements”
was listed in the section “References [40]” and marked in red.
5. Line 162: It is better to change “adulteration oils” to “mixed oils”.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The expression “adulteration
oils” was changed to “mixed oils” and marked in red.
6. Line 167-168: Delete the sentence “The number of reference
chromatogram was set as S1”.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestion! The sentence “The number of
reference chromatogram was set as S1” was deleted.
