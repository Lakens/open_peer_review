label_comment_2
This is an interesting experimental study using a well-studied model pollinator (Bombus
terrestris) and artificial flowers in an indoor lab arena to test the “Efficacy Backup” hypothesis
outlined over a decade ago by Hebets and Papaj and applied more recently to floral biology by
Leonard (with Papaj and Dornhaus). The study benefits from a focused approach and I largely
concur with their interpretation of their experimental results: A) that the presence of complex
odor blends impairs unimodal olfactory learning and is mitigated by the presence of a second
(visual, color) trait, and B) that the presence of air flow in the experimental arena impairs
unimodal olfactory learning and is mitigated (similarly) by the presence of visual (color) traits.
My primary comments concern sloppy editing and informal writing style (see below, all easily
addressed in revision) and the need for more caution in the interpretation of results. There are
limits to the utility of essential oils as surrogates for truly floral scents, and the authors should
consider the spatial scale at which odorants interact in nature vs. their arenas. Also, they only test
one wind speed without justifying it based on measurements in natural environments, so I view
all of the results in this paper as representing “proof of concept”, more of a beginning than a
definitive study. Specific comments are listed below:
Introduction
Line 66: PRIMARILY through these two mechanisms. There are others relevant to floral biology,
including convection (well documented from thermogenic flowers and likely from passively
heating ones) and boundary layer effects (at scale of small visitors such as thrips, mites, ants (all
3
nectar thieves) and smaller flies and beetles that largely confine their activities to floral surfaces.
This requires further and direct experimental study but it is very likely to be important.
Line 72: to draw contrast, use “compared with”. To emphasize similarity, use “compared to”.
Strunk and White: The Elements of Style.
Line 84: Reference 22 is not really about floral communication, whereas the following papers
really do address what happens to odor plume structure and composition when it emanates from
a floral point source:
Reference [23]
Farré-Armengol, G., Peñuelas, J., Li, T., Yli-Pirilä, P., Filella, I., Llusia, J., & Blande, J. D. (2016).
Ozone degrades floral scent and reduces pollinator attraction to flowers. New Phytologist, 209(1),
152-160.
Lines 88-90: I think that it is more important that the same 10 compounds (ocimene, limonene,
benzyl alcohol, linalool, etc.) are present in so many angiosperms…. To me this is much more
potentially confusing to pollinators than the fact that > 1700 compounds have been identified. If
floral scents were more diverse, there would be less opportunity for confusion. My sense from
Knudsen’s reviews is that there is a Poisson distribution of compounds, with the “top 10” present
in nearly half of all angiosperms studied, and the other compounds (e.g. lactones, pyrazines)
showing marked scarcity.
Line 94-98: careful here – some turbulence and plume structure has been shown to be necessary
for upwind orientation, at least in a pheromone tracking context. Use appropriate terms for
plume structure. Laminar flow is almost never observed in nature, so the question becomes
under which conditions is plume tracking optimal?
Line 99: subtle wording. The previous sentence describes disruption of plume structure, but this
sentence describes search time by a bee. This sentence cannot begin with “This is seen…” because
what follows is not a description of plume structure but rather of bee foraging. The connection is
implied but not demonstrated.
Line 107: as described here, reference 17 sounds like a test of the efficacy backup hypothesis,
albeit with the converse order of modalities. Given that the current manuscript is being promoted
as a test of the efficacy backup hypothesis it would be good to clarify whether this other paper
also constitutes a test of that hypothesis.
Lines 108-111: yet you would never suspect this to be true given the preponderance of research
on bee vision and visual foraging in the published literature.
Line 116: It is not guaranteed that the presence of additional blends of floral volatiles would
provide noise or somehow decrease the efficacy of a learned signal blend. There are olfactory
mechanisms by which the presence of a second, contrasting chemical blend might sharpen the
perceptual contrast and enhance response to the first blend. I can envision a continuum of cases
in which the volatile blends of two neighboring or co-blooming species either a) don’t overlap
chemically at all, b) share compounds that are not perceived or learned by foragers, or c) share
key compounds that are highly salient to foragers and can be confused by them. What is the
chemical composition of the two essential oils that were used in these experiments (peppermint
and lavender)? Do they overlap in chemical composition at all with the blends used to provide
“olfactory noise”? My guess is that peppermint (dominated by cyclic monoterpene ketones) does
not accurately model most floral volatile blends, regardless of the numerous prior
demonstrations that bees can learn it.
The following papers address how different blends need to be in order for honey bees to
distinguish between them in this context:
Wright, G. A., Skinner, B. D., & Smith, B. H. (2002). Ability of honeybee, Apis mellifera, to detect
and discriminate odors of varieties of canola (Brassica rapa and Brassica napus) and snapdragon
flowers (Antirrhinum majus). Journal of chemical ecology, 28(4), 721-740.
Wright, G. A., Lutmerding, A., Dudareva, N., & Smith, B. H. (2005). Intensity and the ratios of
compounds in the scent of snapdragon flowers affect scent discrimination by honeybees (Apis
mellifera). Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 191(2), 105-114.

Lines 160-161: please explain further. You mean to state that bees can perceive and differentiate
between blue and yellow stimuli within an associative learning context. Try to justify your
experiments by writing with greater precision as you invoke prior literature and experimental
precedents.
Line 175: is water really a punishment? Bees drink water under certain physiological conditions
and need to maintain water balance as all animals do. This strikes me as an unrewarding rather
than punitive treatment.
Lines 186-189: Option D is worded in a complicated and unclear way. Please simplify and reword

Lines 413-424: yet I find it curious that few of the most highly-cited models of flower constancy
invoke any kind of multi-modal learning. It would be worth adding a few comments to your
discussion about how your results suggest that constancy based on multimodal learning is
favored over unimodal learning in the face of changing environmental features, despite the
speed-accuracy tradeoff inherent to adding a second modality.
Lines 436-441: back to my previous comments about what constitutes chemical interference.
There is a spatial scale component that you have not explored in your arenas, but is very relevant
to dense floral markets, and that has to do with patchiness. Mediterranean shrub communities
tend to be very patchy and therefore present large “chunks” of same-color floral display bathed
(at the finest spatial scales, at least) in their species-specific scents, which often include vegetative
volatiles in those environments. So it would be appropriate to state in your discussion that
although your results provide proof of concept, they also merit further exploration of spatial
scales and chemical differences to help determine when chemical interference is most vs. least
likely to occur. Most hawkmoth-visited flowers either grow in large patches with powerful scent
plumes (e.g. in xeric environments without forest) or in isolated epiphytic patches on branches
within a rainforest setting, where competition with other strong odor plumes is unlikely.
Lines 457-466: to some extent there are data available to address this point,
Farré-Armengol, G., Peñuelas, J., Li, T., Yli-Pirilä, P., Filella, I., Llusia, J., & Blande, J. D. (2016).
Ozone degrades floral scent and reduces pollinator attraction to flowers. New Phytologist, 209(1),
152-160.
Also be aware that there is a temporal component to scent emission, and that an “odorome”
(really a volatile “natural scene” in the parlance of psychophysics) is parsed into time-slices that
increase diversity and likely reduce interference.
Line 468: you have only simulated one wind speed and have not justified it with naturally
measured wind speeds in actual floral communities. This should be addressed in the methods
and with caution here in the discussion. You have not shown at which wind speed there might be
a threshold effect for interference.

The authors have responded substantively to questions and comments from my and the other

from the largely straightforward and interesting results of their experiments.

At this point the remaining (minor) revisions concern writing style and clarity. I have a few
suggestions below, but the document still requires an additional read-through and tune-up by all
authors for the final revision.
Specific changes or points, line numbers refer to the marked-up / revised text rather than the

Line 123: monoterpenes
Lines 136-138: awkward wording, please edit and revise
Lines 149-150: this is not a “me too” experiment. Instead, I suggest “In this study, we test the
converse possibility that under well-lit conditions, visual signals can play a backup efficacy role
for olfactory signals when the latter are obfuscated by noise”. This can be stated more explicitly in
the discussion (lines 462-463)
Lines 251-253: this sentence mixes past tense with preset tense. Please edit for consistency of
voice. Please also edit subsequent sentences for similar problems.
Lines 304-305: criteria are plural, criterion is singular
Lines 527-530: this simply restates a general statement from the introduction. A more effective
statement supported by the results would be, “our findings suggest that in windy habitats with
crowded, scented vegetation (e.g. common to Mediterranean habitats), coloured flowers with
species-specific fragrances would enhance pollinator constancy and foraging efficiency”.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have responded substantively to questions and comments from my and the other
reviewer’s previous reviews. I find the revised text easier to read and digest, and less distracting
from the largely straightforward and interesting results of their experiments.

At this point the remaining (minor) revisions concern writing style and clarity. I have a few
suggestions below, but the document still requires an additional read-through and tune-up by all
authors for the final revision.
Specific changes or points, line numbers refer to the marked-up / revised text rather than the
version with all changes accepted:
Line 123: monoterpenes
Lines 136-138: awkward wording, please edit and revise
Lines 149-150: this is not a “me too” experiment. Instead, I suggest “In this study, we test the
converse possibility that under well-lit conditions, visual signals can play a backup efficacy role
for olfactory signals when the latter are obfuscated by noise”. This can be stated more explicitly in
the discussion (lines 462-463)
Lines 251-253: this sentence mixes past tense with preset tense. Please edit for consistency of
voice. Please also edit subsequent sentences for similar problems.
Lines 304-305: criteria are plural, criterion is singular
Lines 527-530: this simply restates a general statement from the introduction. A more effective
statement supported by the results would be, “our findings suggest that in windy habitats with
crowded, scented vegetation (e.g. common to Mediterranean habitats), coloured flowers with
species-specific fragrances would enhance pollinator constancy and foraging efficiency”.

iew of RSOS-170996 “Colour as a backup for scent in the presence of olfactory noise: testing the
acy backup hypothesis using bumblebees (Bombus terrestris)”
study tested whether visual signals can backup olfactory signals in the presence of chemical
rference or high wind speeds. This question was raised with our previous experiment that examined
backup of visual signals with olfactory signals when light conditions reduced visual signal accuracy.
study had well-executed experiments, relatively straight-forward results, and a good discussion of
relevance and implications. This study is an excellent contribution to the field. My suggestions are
tively minor, as stated below. I highly recommend this manuscript for publication.

Appendix B
We thank both the editor and reviewers for their time in considering our manuscript, and appreciate
the improvements that the comments have made to our text. We respond to the reviewers’ comments
point-by-point below.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Were the trials timed? Although total number of drinks is presented, it is possible that the rate at
which those drinks occurred will show a different trend as in our study.
Unfortunately, trials were not timed so we are unable to look into this relationship.
Did all bees visit at least 40 flowers? If so, the number of correct choices after landing can become an
estimate of accuracy comparable to our study.
All bees did visit at least 40 flowers and a statement mentioning this similarity in accuracy benefits
from multimodal signals has been included in the discussion.
How do you know the bees are still getting a reward upon revisits to a disc? Do you know if they will
consume all the reward in one visit so that they would not necessarily get a ‘drink’ in subsequent
visits? Of course, even if they were not getting the full reward, they are likely to have more positive
reinforcement with the remnant sugar residues than the water in the other flowers, but then the
variable might need a different name.
After bees had drunk from an artificial flower that flower was then refilled with sucrose via pipette –
this is mentioned in the methods (line 219).
Was there any detection of colour preferences or effects of the visual signal colour on any of the
variables?
No colour preferences or effects were detected, but we have added the results of a comparison
between learning times between the two colours (line 309).
If there were colony effects, those should be accounted for in the analyses of that experiment.
In retrospect, we have actually removed the statistics conducted that demonstrated colony
differences, as we believe they are actually meaningless and potentially misleading. Because of the
scheduling of the tests and natural die-off in the bee colonies, some colonies faced completely
different learning criteria to others (depending upon which stage of the experiment was being
conducted), and it is therefore meaningless to compare learning speeds between colonies. We follow
the standard assumption stated in (line 145) that there is sufficient behavioural difference between
individuals within colonies to ignore colony effect, as is discussed in detail by Thomson & Chittka
(2001) [ref 40].
General comments
Line 118: ‘Air-movement test’ is never used again, rather it becomes ‘wind simulation’
Sentence amended to use ‘wind-simulation’ rather than ‘air-movement test’
-
Lines 126-138: How many colonies were used?
In total, 10 colonies were used with a detailed breakdown of which conditions used which colonies in
Tables S1 and S2. I have also included a sentence in the methods to show the total number and direct
readers to the breakdown in the tables.
-

Title and various mentions through the text amended to ‘Artificial flowers’ rather than ‘discs’ – the
word has been kept in a few places for clarity of description.
-
Line 143: Clarify the purpose of the plastic cover. Were these covers what was cleaned between
bees?
An additional sentence has been added (line 155) to clarify the purpose of the plastic covers.

clearer.
-
Lines 240-241: Wasn’t this explained in the ‘Discs’ section? It seems unnecessary to restate info on

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting experimental study using a well-studied model pollinator (Bombus terrestris) and
artificial flowers in an indoor lab arena to test the “Efficacy Backup” hypothesis outlined over a decade
ago by Hebets and Papaj and applied more recently to floral biology by Leonard (with Papaj and
Dornhaus). The study benefits from a focused approach and I largely concur with their interpretation
of their experimental results: A) that the presence of complex odor blends impairs unimodal olfactory
learning and is mitigated by the presence of a second (visual, color) trait, and B) that the presence of
air flow in the experimental arena impairs unimodal olfactory learning and is mitigated (similarly) by
the presence of visual (color) traits.
My primary comments concern sloppy editing and informal writing style (see below, all easily
addressed in revision) and the need for more caution in the interpretation of results. There are limits
to the utility of essential oils as surrogates for truly floral scents, and the authors should consider the
spatial scale at which odorants interact in nature vs. their arenas. Also, they only test one wind speed
without justifying it based on measurements in natural environments, so I view all of the results in
this paper as representing “proof of concept”, more of a beginning than a definitive study. Specific
comments are listed below:
Introduction
Line 66: PRIMARILY through these two mechanisms. There are others relevant to floral biology,
including convection (well documented from thermogenic flowers and likely from passively heating
ones) and boundary layer effects (at scale of small visitors such as thrips, mites, ants (all nectar
thieves) and smaller flies and beetles that largely confine their activities to floral surfaces. This
requires further and direct experimental study but it is very likely to be important.
Thank you for the suggestions, the sentence has been amended to include ‘primarily’ and an additional
sentence has been included to state the likelihood of both boundary layer effects and convection
affecting VOC molecule movement with references (line 70).
-
Line 72: to draw contrast, use “compared with”. To emphasize similarity, use “compared to”. Strunk
and White: The Elements of Style.
Sentence amended. We have also amended other examples throughout the text where appropriate.
-
Line 84: Reference 22 is not really about floral communication, whereas the following papers really do
address what happens to odor plume structure and composition when it emanates from a floral point
source:
Reference [23]
Farré-Armengol, G., Peñuelas, J., Li, T., Yli-Pirilä, P., Filella, I., Llusia, J., & Blande, J. D. (2016). Ozone
degrades floral scent and reduces pollinator attraction to flowers. New Phytologist, 209(1), 152-160.
Additional references added. We have decided to keep reference 22 here as well as it specifically
mentions chemical interference and air turbulence as noise which affects the transmission of floral
volatiles.
-
Lines 88-90: I think that it is more important that the same 10 compounds (ocimene, limonene,
benzyl alcohol, linalool, etc.) are present in so many angiosperms…. To me this is much more
potentially confusing to pollinators than the fact that > 1700 compounds have been identified. If floral
scents were more diverse, there would be less opportunity for confusion. My sense from Knudsen’s
reviews is that there is a Poisson distribution of compounds, with the “top 10” present in nearly half of
all angiosperms studied, and the other compounds (e.g. lactones, pyrazines) showing marked
scarcity.
Sentence has been amended to include reference to particular high frequency volatiles.
-
Line 94-98: careful here – some turbulence and plume structure has been shown to be necessary for
upwind orientation, at least in a pheromone tracking context. Use appropriate terms for plume
structure. Laminar flow is almost never observed in nature, so the question becomes under which
conditions is plume tracking optimal?
We have added reference to the requirement for some heterogeneity in the plume, citing the classic
paper by Vickery on moth orientation (line ref).
-
Line 99: subtle wording. The previous sentence describes disruption of plume structure, but this
sentence describes search time by a bee. This sentence cannot begin with “This is seen…” because
what follows is not a description of plume structure but rather of bee foraging. The connection is
implied but not demonstrated.
Sentence amended to show an implication rather than a demonstration of this connection.
-
Line 107: as described here, reference 17 sounds like a test of the efficacy backup hypothesis, albeit
with the converse order of modalities. Given that the current manuscript is being promoted as a test
of the efficacy backup hypothesis it would be good to clarify whether this other paper also constitutes
a test of that hypothesis.
Sentence amended to clarify the other reference as a test of the efficacy backup hypothesis.
-
Lines 108-111: yet you would never suspect this to be true given the preponderance of research on
bee vision and visual foraging in the published literature.
Sentence has been amended to clarify that the instance of bees using scent rather than vision as the
preferred discriminating factor (Free 1970) is an example that this can occur, rather than a fixed rule.
-
Line 116: It is not guaranteed that the presence of additional blends of floral volatiles would provide
noise or somehow decrease the efficacy of a learned signal blend. There are olfactory mechanisms by
which the presence of a second, contrasting chemical blend might sharpen the perceptual contrast and
enhance response to the first blend. I can envision a continuum of cases in which the volatile blends of
two neighboring or co-blooming species either a) don’t overlap chemically at all, b) share compounds
that are not perceived or learned by foragers, or c) share key compounds that are highly salient to
foragers and can be confused by them. What is the chemical composition of the two essential oils that
were used in these experiments (peppermint and lavender)? Do they overlap in chemical composition
at all with the blends used to provide “olfactory noise”? My guess is that peppermint (dominated by
cyclic monoterpene ketones) does not accurately model most floral volatile blends, regardless of the
numerous prior demonstrations that bees can learn it.
The following papers address how different blends need to be in order for honey bees to distinguish
between them in this context:
Wright, G. A., Skinner, B. D., & Smith, B. H. (2002). Ability of honeybee, Apis mellifera, to detect and
discriminate odors of varieties of canola (Brassica rapa and Brassica napus) and snapdragon flowers
(Antirrhinum majus). Journal of chemical ecology, 28(4), 721-740.

compounds in the scent of snapdragon flowers affect scent discrimination by honeybees (Apis
mellifera). Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 191(2), 105-114.
Thank you for the suggestions. An additional paragraph has been added to the discussion to discuss
these points.
-
Line 121: will, not with
Sentence amended.
Methods
Lines 160-161: please explain further. You mean to state that bees can perceive and differentiate
between blue and yellow stimuli within an associative learning context. Try to justify your experiments
by writing with greater precision as you invoke prior literature and experimental precedents.
Sentence amended for clarity.
-
Line 175: is water really a punishment? Bees drink water under certain physiological conditions and
need to maintain water balance as all animals do. This strikes me as an unrewarding rather than
punitive treatment.
‘Punishment’ replaced with ‘non-rewarding stimulus’.
-
Lines 186-189: Option D is worded in a complicated and unclear way. Please simplify and reword your
description of this treatment.
Sentence amended for clarity.

rather important distinction to get right in your text!
Oops – thank you for spotting that! Word amended.

Sentences amended.
-
Lines 294-296: what about learning times for lavender vs. peppermint in the absence of chemical
interference? Are they comparable as baseline CS’s?
Sentence has been amended for clarity as these results reflect all instances of scent use in this
experiment which included those exposed to chemical interference and those which are not.

Line 339: “The number of positive drinks which followed positive drinks… “ ?

Sentence amended.
-
Line 407: stimuli were found
Sentence amended.
-
Line 412: stimuli are (stimulus is singular, stimuli are plural)
Sentence amended.
-
Lines 413-424: yet I find it curious that few of the most highly-cited models of flower constancy
invoke any kind of multi-modal learning. It would be worth adding a few comments to your discussion
about how your results suggest that constancy based on multimodal learning is favored over unimodal
learning in the face of changing environmental features, despite the speed-accuracy tradeoff inherent
to adding a second modality.
A sentence has been added (line 424) to emphasise this benefit to flower constancy from multimodal
learning over unimodal leaning in the presence of environmental variability.
-
Lines 436-441: back to my previous comments about what constitutes chemical interference. There is
a spatial scale component that you have not explored in your arenas, but is very relevant to dense
floral markets, and that has to do with patchiness. Mediterranean shrub communities tend to be very
patchy and therefore present large “chunks” of same-color floral display bathed (at the finest spatial
scales, at least) in their species-specific scents, which often include vegetative volatiles in those
environments. So it would be appropriate to state in your discussion that although your results provide
proof of concept, they also merit further exploration of spatial scales and chemical differences to help
determine when chemical interference is most vs. least likely to occur. Most hawkmoth-visited flowers
either grow in large patches with powerful scent plumes (e.g. in xeric environments without forest) or
in isolated epiphytic patches on branches within a rainforest setting, where competition with other
strong odor plumes is unlikely.
An additional statement at the end of the discussion (line 516) has been included to highlight the need
for further study into these areas.
-
Lines 457-466: to some extent there are data available to address this point,
Farré-Armengol, G., Peñuelas, J., Li, T., Yli-Pirilä, P., Filella, I., Llusia, J., & Blande, J. D. (2016). Ozone
degrades floral scent and reduces pollinator attraction to flowers. New Phytologist, 209(1), 152-160.
Also be aware that there is a temporal component to scent emission, and that an “odorome” (really a
volatile “natural scene” in the parlance of psychophysics) is parsed into time-slices that increase
diversity and likely reduce interference.
Thank you for this clarification. We have added the citation to this section.
-
Line 468: you have only simulated one wind speed and have not justified it with naturally measured
wind speeds in actual floral communities. This should be addressed in the methods and with caution
here in the discussion. You have not shown at which wind speed there might be a threshold effect for
interference.
Sentences in the method have been amended to include a statement that the wind speed used within
our experiment is likely to be over the threshold at which there is known to be an interfering effect
(line 259), linking to a paper relating to odour source location in tsetse flies (Brady et al. 1995).
