The paper seems to be interesting, but the current presentation did not meet the criteria to be
evaluated. It is not only English problem, it is that there a lack of many information that may be
critical for a proper evaluations and a general lack of organization. Thus, I recommend the paper
to be corrected and a revised and greatly improved version of the manuscript re-evaluated.
Some points detected in this first evaluation (that I stopped in methods section after checking the
interest of the results) may be found below:
Abstract
“….stability of immobilizED lipase”
Please, explain “design based on inter-facial activation and solution polymerization” Interfacial
activation of the support of the lipase?
“….8 times reuse…” Reaction,) Time and conditions?
“rendering interactions between the low cost supports materials and lipase” Explain better.
Introduction
“Immobilizing lipase on various supports in different ways, can promise the function
of improving the thermal stability and reusability, leading a lower cost of enzyme application.”
Explain better. Immobilization may improve stability via multipoint or multisubunit
immobilization, improve activity, selectivity or specificity, resistance to chemicals and inhibitors,
even purity. Some of these recent reviews may be of interest.

Avoid unnecessary wrong general generalization like this “while strong covalent attachment
may cause lipase irreversibly deactivated” It may also if properly controlled increase activity and
stability.
“As we know, a hydrophilic/hydrophobic support is in conformity with the dual nature of the
lipase itself, which is mostly hydrophilic with some hydrophobic patches surrounding its active
sites[40]. Too hydrophilic or too hydrophobic supports are not appropriate to bring high activity
of
lipases. Therefore, introducing suitable functional groups to adjust the property of hydrophilic
and hydrophobic of the SP surface can serve the hydrophobic functionalized SP as an ideal
carrier
for the low cost immobilization of lipase”. Here it is very disorganized: lipase mechanism of
action should be explained first, called interfacial activation, as it is the driving force for enzyme
immobilization on hydrophobic supports, involving the open form of lipases. Papers from
enzyme structure (Derewenda among others), interfacial activation (Verger, etc) and the last
paper showing how the pen form of lipase is involved in immobilization should be added:

The authors fabricated PVP-covered silicone particles by two-steps modification of silane
coupling with MPS and radical polymerization with N-vinylpyrrolidone. After the
immobilization of lipase, structural characterization and catalytic activities were investigated.
But I think this manuscript requires a significant upgrade to make it suitable for publication.
Although the authors emphasized that the amphiphilicity of PVP was quite important for the
efficient immobilization and high catalytic activity, there are no strong evidence. For comparison,
the lipase immobilization with hydrophilic pristine silicone particles and hydrophobic
polystyrene-corted silicone particles should be carried out.
In addition, the novelty of this surface modification is not high because the synthetic protocol of
polymer-covered silicone particles is same as the Gao’ report (ref 38) with the exception of using
N-vinylpyrrolidone. Furthermore, the experimental section is not suitable (Details will be
described later).

Avoid unnecessary wrong general generalization like this “while strong covalent attachment
may cause lipase irreversibly deactivated” It may also if properly controlled increase activity and
stability.
“As we know, a hydrophilic/hydrophobic support is in conformity with the dual nature of the
lipase itself, which is mostly hydrophilic with some hydrophobic patches surrounding its active
sites[40]. Too hydrophilic or too hydrophobic supports are not appropriate to bring high activity
of
lipases. Therefore, introducing suitable functional groups to adjust the property of hydrophilic
14
and hydrophobic of the SP surface can serve the hydrophobic functionalized SP as an ideal
carrier
for the low cost immobilization of lipase”. Here it is very disorganized: lipase mechanism of
action should be explained first, called interfacial activation, as it is the driving force for enzyme
immobilization on hydrophobic supports, involving the open form of lipases. Papers from
enzyme structure (Derewenda among others), interfacial activation (Verger, etc) and the last
paper showing how the pen form of lipase is involved in immobilization should be added:

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
The authors fabricated PVP-covered silicone particles by two-steps modification of silane
coupling with MPS and radical polymerization with N-vinylpyrrolidone. After the
immobilization of lipase, structural characterization and catalytic activities were investigated.
But I think this manuscript requires a significant upgrade to make it suitable for publication.
Although the authors emphasized that the amphiphilicity of PVP was quite important for the
efficient immobilization and high catalytic activity, there are no strong evidence. For comparison,
the lipase immobilization with hydrophilic pristine silicone particles and hydrophobic
polystyrene-corted silicone particles should be carried out.
In addition, the novelty of this surface modification is not high because the synthetic protocol of
polymer-covered silicone particles is same as the Gao’ report (ref 38) with the exception of using
N-vinylpyrrolidone. Furthermore, the experimental section is not suitable (Details will be
described later).

To demonstrate the superiority of amphiphilic PVP functionalization, the authors prepared
immobilized lipase with and hydrophilic silicone nanoparticle (SP) and hydrophobic
polystyrene-covered SP (SP-Pst). However SP-Pst they synthesized is not suitable for comparison.
IR spectrum of SP-Pst, having distinguishing peaks at 1660 and 2970 cm-1, indicate the remaining
of PVP polymer which was used as dispersant during the grafting reaction of polystyrene (SP-Pst
in Ref 51 gave different IR spectrum). Despite the containing amphiphilic PVP polymer, SP-
Pst@CPL showed less cycle stability than SP-PVP@CRL. The author should comment on this and
additional experiments with PVP-removed SP-Pst are required to prove the advantage of
amphiphilic decoration before it can be accepted for publication.

Comment 1: “….stability of immobilizED lipase”. Please, explain “design based on inter-facial
activation and solution polymerization” Interfacial activation of the support of the lipase?
Response: Thanks for the comment. The sentence of “we demonstrate an amphiphilic
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) grafted on silicone particles (SP) surface materials (PVP-SP) with
rational design based on inter-facial activation and solution polymerization” was used for stating
the preparation process of PVP-SP materials. We need to inter-facial activate silicone particles by
methane sulfoacid before polymerization.
Comment 2: “….8 times reuse…” Reaction,) Time and conditions?
Response: The recyclability of the biocatalyst was evaluated in consecutive batches of the
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylpalmitate (p-NPP). 30 mg of SP-PVP@CRL and 1 mL 0.5% p-NPP
ethanol solution (w:v) was mixed in 1 mL 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer for 30 min at 37 <U+2103>
under mild stirring. For clearly, we add some sentence in the Materials and Methods parts (Page 3,
paragraph 7, Line 8-11)
Comment 3: “rendering interactions between the low cost supports materials and lipase” Explain
better.
Response: Thanks for the very constructive comments. We rewrote the corresponding places to
make our statements more scientifically accurate. The corresponding revisions locate at page 1,
paragraph 1, Line 14-16.
Comment 4: Introduction.“Immobilizing lipase on various supports in different ways, can
promise the function of improving the thermal stability and reusability, leading a lower cost of
enzyme application.” Explain better. Immobilization may improve stability via multipoint or
multisubunit immobilization, improve activity, selectivity or specificity, resistance to chemicals
and inhibitors, even purity. Some of these recent reviews may be of interest.
Response: To state more clearly, we rewrote the corresponding places that locate at page 1,
paragraph 2, Line 10-13 and page 2, line 1-3. The recommended recent reviews have been added.
Comment 5: Avoid unnecessary wrong general generalization like this “while strong covalent
attachment. may cause lipase irreversibly deactivated” It may also if properly controlled increase
activity and stability.
Response: The suggestion is indeed correct. We rewrote the sentence locate at Page 2, Line 4-5.
Comment 6: “As we know, a hydrophilic/hydrophobic support is in conformity with the dual
nature of the lipase itself, which is mostly hydrophilic with some hydrophobic patches
surrounding its active sites [40]. Too hydrophilic or too hydrophobic supports are not appropriate
to bring high activity of lipases. Therefore, introducing suitable functional groups to adjust the
property of hydrophilic and hydrophobic of the SP surface can serve the hydrophobic
functionalized SP as an ideal carrier for the low cost immobilization of lipase”. Here it is very
disorganized: lipase mechanism of action should be explained first, called interfacial activation, as
it is the driving force for enzyme immobilization on hydrophobic supports, involving the open
form of lipases. Papers from enzyme structure (Derewenda among others), interfacial activation
(Verger, etc) and the last paper showing how the pen form of lipase is involved in immobilization
should be added:
Response: Thanks for the comments. We rewrote the corresponding places to make our
statements more scientifically accurate. The corresponding revisions locate at page 2, paragraph 1,
Line 15-25. The recommended recent reviews have been added.

Comment 7: “and benefit the mass transfer for the high surface areas” mass transfer and surface
area may go even in the opposite direction, explain better.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s reminding. We rewrote the corresponding places to make our
statements more scientifically accurate (Page 2, paragraph1, Line 11-12).
Comment 8: Polyvinylpyrrolidone is more hydrophilic than other molecules, like SP, but not
more than water or other polymers, like sugars.
Response: We add the experiment to compare the hydrophilic pristine silicone particles and
hydrophobic polystyrene-corted silicone particles as carriers for the lipase immobilization. The
relative revise have been shown in manuscript. We have addressed the questions when responding
to the second question of reviewer 2
Comment 9: “were dispersed in lipase solution,” Define lipase solution, how it is prepared, buffer,
etc.
Response: The lipase solution was prepared by dispersing the CRL in phosphate buffer (0.1 M,
pH = 7.0) for a certain concentration. Then the solution was centrifugation to obtain supernatant.
Comment 10: “The three obtained immobilized lipase was stored at 4 °C until they were used.”
Define the 2 biocatalysts
Response: Follow the above comment, for comparable parameters, we add another two carriers
for the lipase immobilization. The two carriers are the hydrophilic pristine silicone particles and
hydrophobic polystyrene-corted silicone particles.
Comment 11: “p-NPP per Define pNPP Etc etc
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s reminding. The used p-NPP was short for
p-nitrophenylpalmitate. We revised the descriptions in experimental part.
Reviewer: 2
Comment 1: But I think this manuscript requires a significant upgrade to make it suitable for
publication. Although the authors emphasized that the amphiphilicity of PVP was quite important
for the efficient immobilization and high catalytic activity, there are no strong evidence. For
comparison, the lipase immobilization with hydrophilic pristine silicone particles and hydrophobic
polystyrene-corted silicone particles should be carried out.
Response: Thanks for the very constructive comments. We add the experiment to compare the
hydrophilic pristine silicone particles and hydrophobic polystyrene-corted silicone particles as
carriers for the lipase immobilization. According to our current data, we rewrote the corresponding
places. The corresponding revisions locate at Page 2, paragraph 3, Line 4-6 and Page 3, paragraph
1-2 and Page 3, paragraph 3. According to our current data, we change the chart of the relative
place, which located at fig 6, fig7 and fig 8. Naturally, the corresponding places of description
these figure were rewrote.
Comment 2: In addition, the novelty of this surface modification is not high because the synthetic
protocol of polymer-covered silicone particles is same as the Gao’ report (ref 38) with the
exception of using N-vinylpyrrolidone.
Response: Thanks for the valuable comments. In our work, the introduction of the modifier PVP
was the key point in the performance of immobilized lipase, in the three immobilized lipase, the
PVP-SP@CRL offered the best stability, durability and catalytic performances, therefore, the
presence of PVP highlighted our work and made it different from other’s study.
Comment 3: Furthermore, the experimental section is not suitable (Details will be described
later).

Comment 1: To demonstrate the superiority of amphiphilic PVP functionalization, the authors
prepared immobilized lipase with and hydrophilic silicone nanoparticle (SP) and hydrophobic
polystyrene-covered SP (SP-Pst). However SP-Pst they synthesized is not suitable for comparison.
IR spectrum of SP-Pst, having distinguishing peaks at 1660 and 2970 cm-1, indicate the remaining
of PVP polymer which was used as dispersant during the grafting reaction of polystyrene (SP-Pst
in Ref 51 gave different IR spectrum). Despite the containing amphiphilic PVP polymer,
SP-Pst@CPL showed less cycle stability than SP-PVP@CRL. The author should comment on this
and additional experiments with PVP-removed SP-Pst are required to prove the advantage of
amphiphilic decoration before it can be accepted for publication.
Response: Thanks for the comment. To prove the advantage of ampliphilic PVP decoration, we
conducted experiments with PVP-removed SP-Pst. For comparison, we prepared the SP-Pst with
two different methods (solution polymerization and dispersion polymerization). The SP-Pst
prepared by solution polymerization method with toluene as solvent which assigned SP/Pst-b.
Similarly, the SP-Pst prepared by dispersion polymerization method with ethyl alcohol and water
as solvent which assigned SP/Pst-e. We were also compared the recycle performance and measure
the IR of the three materials and each immobilization lipase. The recycle performance and IR of
each immobilization lipase were showed at fig 1 and fig 2. Form fig 1, the PVP decorated SP as
carrier showed better performance and the results are similar with our article. For the three Pst
decorated SP, SP/Pst-b@CRL and SP/Pst-e@CRL are equal in recycle performance than the
previous SP-Pst@CRL. It is that the surface of SP-Pst governed by hydrophobic Pst, though PVP
may remain rarely after several wash times. For the IR of the three materials and each
immobilization lipase, we can see that the PVP and Pst were grafted on the SP successful (the
results were similar with the report, ref: J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 102, 5808-5817; J. Colloid. Interf. Sci.
197, 293–308). For IR spectrum of the new prepared SP-Pst, the peaks at 1634 and 2956 cm-1
were also existed, which might be the influence of MPS.
Also, we rewrote the corresponding places to make our statements more scientifically accurate

SP-PVP@CRL
The method of prepare Pst-grafted SP was described below:
1. Dispersion polymerization
3 g MPS-SP were dispersed in 200 g ethanol/water mixture (94.5/5.5, wt/wt) and the mixture
was treated with ultrasonic for 30 min. Then 2 g styrene and 0.2 g AIBN was added slowly
and the reaction was carried out at 70 °C under N2 atmosphere for 12 h. After the termination
of polymerization, the mixture was <U+FB01>ltrated and washed with ethanol more than 5 times.
Finally the products were dried under vacuum to obtain the pale grays SP/Pst-e materials.
2. Solution polymerization
Solvent toluene, MPS-SiO2, and styrene were added in turn into a three-necked flask equipped
with a water condenser and N2 was purged for 30 min so as to eliminate air. In the inert
atmosphere of N2, the content of flask was first agitated for 1h to disperse MPS-SiO2 fully,
then the temperature was increased up to 80 oC, initiator AIBN was introduced, and the
reaction was carried out for 7 h. After the termination of polymerization, the mixture was
filtrated, and the product was extracted with toluene in soxhlet extractor for 20 h, and then
washed with ethanol. Finally the product was dried under vacuum.
