Papet et al. conducted detailed acoustic measurements on a living Nile crocodile and a broad-
snouted caiman, as well as on some Nile crocodile skulls to investigate what sound localizations
cues could be provided by the head anatomy and the position of the eardrums. They found that
the head morphology contributes to the creation of sound location cues, that the same applies to
postures in water and on land, and how the interaural canal influences these phenomena.
This paper provides solid, detailed, and scientifically outstanding data. The topic is highly
technical, yet the authors mange to include explanations which make the material accessible to
readers less familiar with the physics involved. The findings are by their nature descriptive and
the authors provide a well-illustrated and highlighted summary.
I only have very few comments and suggestions:

Line 21: I think an “and” is missing after “first),”
Line 36-41: This is confusing me a bit; the English is not very clear. I would suggest the following
changes: L36-37: “By combining results from passive acoustic experiments and
measurements….”, L39: instead of “be lead” rather “focus”, L40: in natural positions in water,
and on an extended frequency range.
L43-44: “…they mostly come on land to regulate…”
Page 4:
L14-15: Are these the dorsal cranial length (DCL) measurements? Even so, I would argue that a
DCL of 22.7 cm is not an adult Nile crocodile, maximally a subadult.
L28-29: If possible please provide the ages, and sizes of the animals. Particularly the head length
would be important in the context of the paper.
L39-40: Were the animals actually trained to lay still, e.g. rewarded for staying still? Or were they
simply habituated to the procedure?
L43-45: “Effects” could only be noted if the animals could be compared to untested animals. The
authors probably mean to say that the animals behaved similarly to the time before testing.
L52: Here and throughout the text, consider to change “Ground condition” to “Land condition”.
The dichotomy is between land and water; not ground and water. A body of water has a ground.

Review of manuscript ‘Influence of head morphology and natural postures on sound localization
cues in crocodilians’ (RSOS-190423) by L. Papet et al.
This is an interesting and well-written manuscript that should be published in RS Open Science
following several clarifications and additional points. The study is technically elegant, the
writing is clear and organized well, and the subject concerns animals that do hear but have
received relatively little attention in bioacoustic research. The points below concern ways for
making the study more clear, particularly for non-specialists, and additional questions that
readers are likely to have.
The authors should emphasize that acquiring information indicative of the location of a sound
source (ILD, ITD, monaural cues) does not necessarily mean that such information is actually
used by the animal. There is a hint of this awareness in the very end of the discussion, but the
authors should be more direct earlier in the paper. An excellent example of this issue was found
in the highly developed color vision of mantis shrimp : despite their ability to resolve very small
wavelength differences, the ability is not used behaviorally, as in predation and mating.
The subject of monaural cues is most interesting, but it needs a few clarifications, notably for non-
specialists. These cues, generally associated with the external ear, provide a different spectral
profile for sound perceived in a given ear depending on whether the sound source is ipsilateral or
contralateral to that ear. The profile differences often entail ‘notches’ at certain frequencies for
sound arriving contralaterally, and it can allow an animal that is deaf in one ear to nonetheless
localize a sound source. But in intact animals – as the crocodilians in the study were – the cues
are really binaural, since the spectral profiles will be available from both ears and can be
4
compared. Thus, cues from the external ear, which are monaural in a ‘one-eared’ animal, can
serve to enhance ILD and ITD differences in a binaural context.
Can a verbal description be given of the spectral profiles that indicate an ipsilateral or a
contralateral sound source ? Does this ‘monaural’ mechanism work better for some sound
frequencies than others ? Would learning play a role in using monaural cues ?
The authors note that a salient feature of crocodilian biology is their amphibious activity. Their
study focused on hearing in air, and one wonders whether hearing directionality may also
function in water (below the surface) ? Do crocodilians need to rely on such hearing for
predation ? For localizing conspecifics ?
The authors note that hearing, and directional hearing in particular, may have influenced the
evolution of head morphology in crocodilians. How realistic is this claim given the importance of
head morphology (jaw articulations, etc.) for predation ? How important is hearing, and
specifically directional hearing, for predation in crocodilians ? Some natural history information
would be helpful.

cues (Head-Related Transfer Functions: HRTFs) on
alive animals and skulls in two situations, both
mimicking natural positions: basking on the land
and cruising at the interface between air and water.
Binaural cues were also estimated by measuring the
Interaural Level Differences (ILDs) and the Interaural
Time Differences (ITDs). In both conditions, HRTF
measurements show large spectral variations (> 10
dB) for high frequencies, depending on the azimutal
angle. These localization cues are influenced by head
size and by the internal coupling of the ears. ITDs give
reliable information regarding sound-source position
for low frequencies, while ILDs are more suitable for
frequencies higher than 1.5 kHz. Our results support
the hypothesis that crocodilian head morphology is
adapted to acquire reliable localization cues from
sound sources when outside the water, but also when
only a small part of their head is above the air-water
interface.

1. Introduction 3
As top predators, crocodilians have developed fascinating sensory skills: accurate vision in
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc B 0000000
air [1,2], highly developed olfaction [3,4], precise abilities to detect water vibrations [5–7],
and an acute sense of hearing [8,9]. Experimental studies, as well as field observations, have
demonstrated that the auditory modality is of primary importance for both their social life (e.g.
during mating and mother-offspring interactions) and hunting success [10,11]. Although it is
known that crocodilians hear sounds over a broad frequency range (from around 300 Hz up to 8
kHz, with a peak in audiogram around 1 kHz [8,9]), and while the functional anatomy of the ear
of these archosaurs is similar in many respects to that of birds [12], we have little knowledge on
many aspects of their hearing biology. Thus, while some observations have brought evidence for
..........................................................
directional hearing in crocodilians, suggesting the existence of specialized adaptations [13–15],
how they localize sound sources in their environment remains poorly described.
In birds and mammals including humans, sound-source localization relies on Interaural Time
Differences (ITDs: a sound from the left will arrive at the left ear first) and Interaural Level
Differences (ILDs: a sound from the left will be louder in the left ear due to the shadowing effect
of the head). Moreover, monaural spectral cues are induced by the filtering effect of the head:
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) result from sounds experiencing spectral modifications
during their propagation through and around the head, providing different spectral cues when
arriving from different azimuths and elevations [16]. The detection of sounds and the perception
of localization cues are often reinforced by some anatomical particularities such as the external
ears of mammals [17], and ruff feathers and asymmetrical ears of the barn owl [18]. Remarkably,
the hearing apparatus of crocodilians includes a well-developed external ear formed by horny,
prominent bone overhanging a muscular ear-lid that protects the eardrum [15,19,20], suggesting
a functional role in directional hearing.
Previous studies showed that some directional information is encoded in the auditory nerve
of juvenile American alligators Alligator mississipiensis. These data support the hypothesis that the
acoustic coupling of middle-ear air cavities - an anatomical particularity found in both birds and
crocodilians - could enhance localization abilities [21]. By combining results from passive acoustic
experiments and measurements of auditory brainstem response to sounds in young alligators,
Bierman et al. suggested that HRTFs do not entirely account for the level of directional sensitivity
in auditory nerve activity. However this requires further consideration and the current study
will focus on larger animals (alive and skulls), in natural positions in water, and on an extended
frequency range.
The main characteristic of crocodilian biology is their amphibious way of life. These animals
spend most of their active time at the interface between air and water while they mostly come
on land to regulate their internal temperature by basking motionless in the sun [22]. In water, the
upper part of the head -with the nostrils, eyes and ears- appears above the waterline (figure 1a,
b). The acoustic environment of crocodilians may be strongly influenced by this position, as air
and water show different sound-propagation properties. As water acts as a reflective surface, it
should contribute to the properties of sound waves arriving at the eardrums.
In the present paper, we investigate the acoustic localization cues available to crocodilians,
paying specific attention to the effect of the air-water interface, and its interaction with head
morphology and head size. We hypothesize that localization cues generated by interactions
between sound waves and the head morphology still exist when the animal is at the interface of
air and water, in spite of having most of its body concealed underwater. It is worth to note that the
presence of such cues does not necessarily induce the behavioral use of the cues by the animals.
Using microphones positioned within the ears, we recorded sounds emitted by a source set up
at different azimuths from the animal’s head axis. We then measured HRTFs, which characterize
the transfer function of the spatial acoustic filter created by the head and body of the animal. 4
This method has commonly been used in humans and other species (e.g. mammals [23,24],
alligators [21] and birds [18]). As HRTFs are related to the complex absorption and reflection
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc B 0000000
pattern of acoustical waveforms by the head and body, we compared HRTFs obtained with the
crocodile positioned at the interface of air and water with those obtained with the animal’s whole
body outside water. We further estimated the potential influence of species-specific head shape on
HRTFs by performing the experiment on individuals from two different species: the Nile crocodile
Crocodylus niloticus and the broad-snouted caiman Caiman latirostris. To assess the impact of head
size, we measured HRTFs on three skulls of different rostral snout lengths: 6.9 cm, 16.5 cm and
22.7 cm, corresponding respectively to a juvenile, a young and subadult Nile crocodile. Beside
HRTF monaural cues, the binaural cues ITDs (Interaural Time Differences) and ILDs (Interaural
..........................................................
Level Differences) are also well known to facilitate sound-source localization. We computed ITDs
by comparing the waves’ arrival time between the two ears, and ILDs by calculating the difference
of sound pressure level measured at the right and left ears. Overall, our results may suggest that
the shape of the crocodilian head induces both monaural (HRTF) and binaural (ITD, ILD) sound
localization cues even when the head is mostly concealed in water.
2. Material and methods
(a) Experimental models
We assessed acoustic localization cues on two living animals (see pictures on figure 2) and three
skulls (see pictures on figure 3). The animals were one broad-snouted caiman Caiman latirostris
(rostral snout length: 4.4 cm, 2 years old) and one Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus (rostral
snout length: 6.9 cm, 2 years old), provided by the zoo Planète Crocodiles (Civaux, France).
Both individuals were accommodated in the ENES lab in dedicated areas. These species show
strong differences in head morphology (Erickson et al. [25]) that are well-illustrated by the rostral
proportion: C. latirostris has the broadest snout, whereas the rostral proportion of C. niloticus is just
above the average of the 23 crocodilian species. In addition, we measured monaural and binaural
cues on three skulls of Nile crocodiles (rostral snout length from 6.9 cm, 16.5 cm and 22.7 cm).
(b) Animal condition
A critical point with the living individuals was to prevent movements while minimizing
stress during HRTF measurements. Three months prior to the experiment, both animals were
habituated to remain motionless on a board for 30 minutes. The animal position was further
secured by straps. This procedure allowed avoiding anaesthesia, which is difficult to master
in crocodilians and could have been a survival risk [22]. During the experiments, we (NB)
continuously assessed the stress level of the animal by observing its pupillary dilatation and
behaviour (escape attempts). During the weeks following the experiments, the condition of both
animals was carefully monitored in terms of growth parameters and behaviour (e.g. food intake),
and the animals behaved similarly to the time before testing.
(c) Signal acquisition for HRTFs measurements
We measured HRTFs in two conditions mimicking biologically relevant situations (figure 1):
1) ’Land condition’: The animal was placed on a board lying on the land of a semi-anechoic
room (LVA-INSA Lyon: background noise level = 20 ± 1 dB SPL; reverberation time = 0.1 ± 0.1
s), mimicking a position frequently used by crocodilians when basking (figure 1a, c and e). The
ground of the semi-anechoic room can be considered as perfectly reflective to acoustic waves.
2) ’Interface condition’: The animal was placed in water, with its nostrils, eyes and ears just 5
above the waterline (figure 1b, d, f). This condition mimicked the natural position of an animal
in water, e.g. when cruising, ambushing prey or protecting its young. In this position, the water
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc B 0000000
surface was also considered to be fully reverberant, thanks to the short distance between the
acoustic source and the microphones.
Under both conditions, the sound source (loudspeaker) was positioned 1 meter from the centre
of the head of the animal (defined as the point equidistant between the two ears, see figure
1), with 0<U+25E6> elevation. A rotation of the animal’s body along its antero-posterior axis enabled
measurements of HRTFs in a 2D plane between –90 and +90<U+25E6> in 5<U+25E6> increments. The sound-
emitting equipment was composed of a sound card (Presonus, Audiobox 44-VSL) connected via
..........................................................
an amplifier (Yamaha, AX-397) to the loudspeaker (AudioPro loudspeaker, Bravo Allroom Sat).
The loudspeaker was hung just above the ground or the waterline to avoid acoustic coupling
with the ground or the water. The centre of the medium loudspeaker membrane was placed at
the same height as the microphones that were inside the ears.
The experiments were always performed with the ears out of the water. We placed one
microphone (Knowles, FG-23329-P07) inside the cavity of each ear, behind the ear-lid and close
to, but without touching, the tympanic membrane. This allowed simultaneous recording of the
sounds arriving at both right and left ears. The recording equipment was composed of both left
and right microphones connected to the input channels of the sound card (sampling frequency =
44.1 Hz).
The emitted signal was a logarithmic sine sweep (frequency range = 20-10000 Hz; duration = 5
s; intensity level = 80 ± 0.5 dB SPL). The frequency range was chosen to mostly cover the hearing
range of crocodilians, which is mainly centred on 1-2 kHz [8,9]. For analysis purposes, we used
a Matlab code to synchronise in time the source signal with the two recorded microphonic signals.
Prior each measurement, we calibrated the broadcast signals in the absence of any animal,
with both microphones placed at the virtual centre of the crocodile’s head. This calibration
was a necessary step to take into account the properties of the sound-producing and recording
equipment (’transfer function’ due to material gains, frequency responses, etc.) in HRTFs
measurements. Recorded signals were averaged (n=10) and used as a reference to compensate
for this transfer function.
In addition to HRTF calculations, we measured Interaural Time Differences (ITDs) and
Interaural Level Differences (ILDs) using the out-of-water set-up. First, we sent an impulse signal
(pulse) to estimate the broadband ITD. We then broadcast 500 ms pure tones at 125, 250, 500
and 1000 Hz. Since Carr et al. [26] demonstrated that in alligators ITDs are not coded in the
auditory nerve for frequencies over 1 kHz, we chose to consider only frequencies below 1 kHz.
The ITD corresponds to the value of t maximising the cross correlation between left and right
R+8
ears -8 sL (t)s*R (t - t )dt, where t is the time and t is the time delay between left and right
microphonic signals (sL (t) and sR (t), respectively). Assuming symmetry of the head, ITDs were
normalized to the 0<U+25E6> value. Directly from HRTF measurements and because of the assumption of
symmetry to the normal incidence, the ILD can be calculated for a given frequency and azimuth
as:
ILD(f, <U+03B8>) = H(f, <U+03B8>) - H(f, -<U+03B8>), (2.1)
where f is the frequency, <U+03B8> the azimuth of the sound source and H(f, <U+03B8>) the Head-Related Transfer
Function.
(d) Signal processing 6
To avoid clipping, we applied a Hanning ramp (501 points) at the onset and at the end of recorded
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc B 0000000
microphonic signals, and normalized all recorded signals by the root-mean square amplitude of
the normal incidence signal (left and right channels independently).
The spectrum of the recorded microphonic signals (R) within the ear can be expressed as a linear
combination of frequency (f ), sound source azimuth (<U+03B8>), elevation (f) and microphone position
(~x), such as:
x) = S(f ) × H(f, <U+03B8>, f) × µ(f, ~
R(f, <U+03B8>, f, ~ x), (2.2)
x) is
where S(f ) is the calibration signal, H(f ) is the Head-Related Transfer Function and µ(f, ~
..........................................................
the contribution of the microphone position (adapted from [16]).
In our experiments, elevation was maintained at 0<U+25E6> . HRTFs thus depend only on the
sound source azimuth and the sound frequency. One caveat concerns the in-ear position of
the microphones: as they were placed under the (opaque) ear-lids, their position could not be
perfectly assessed and could be slightly different between left and right ears. We took into account
this potential issue by performing two methodological steps. First, the position of the microphone
was carefully controlled to be as reliable as possible. Second, we used a normalization method
adapted from that developed by Midllebrooks [16] to reduce the effect of microphone position
in the human ear canal when measuring HRTF. Briefly speaking, the measured microphonic
signal was normalized by the average of all microphonic signals (µ(f, ~ x)), depending only on
the frequency and the position of the microphone. The HRTF was then supposed to depend only
on the frequency and the azimuth of the sound source, as follows:
N
x)
R(f, <U+03B8>, ~ 1 1 X
H(f, <U+03B8>) = , with: µ(f, ~
x) = Ri (f, <U+03B8>i , ~
x), (2.3)
S(f ) × µ(f, ~
x) S(f ) N
i=1
where N is the number of microphonic signals.
To limit the error in HRTF estimations, we considered in this study each head as symmetrical
and thus averaged the HRTFs simultaneously measured in the right and left ears. To limit
discontinuities in HRTF measurements along angular and frequential axes, we applied a
smoothing procedure based on a two-dimensional floating Gaussian window normalised in
amplitude with a 5 points width in azimuth and a logarithmically varying width in frequency
(3 Hz at f = 20 Hz and 1 kHz at f = 10 kHz).
Finally, we calculated a Potential Localization Level (PLL) based on HRTF and ILD as follows:
90
1 X <U+2202>H(f, <U+03B8>)
P LLH (f ) = 20 × log10 ( ), (2.4)
N<U+03B8> <U+2202><U+03B8>
<U+03B8>=-90
and,
90
1 X <U+2202>ILD(f, <U+03B8>)
P LLILD (f ) = 20 × log10 ( ), (2.5)
N<U+03B8> <U+2202><U+03B8>
<U+03B8>=-90
with N<U+03B8> is the number of azimuth positions (in here <U+03B8> varies between -90 and 90<U+25E6> with a step
of 5<U+25E6> , so: N<U+03B8> = 37). P LLH (f ) and P LLILD (f ) are expressed in dB. The PLLs are computed to
facilitate the comparison of HRTFs and ILDs between the different conditions. Classically, sound
localization cues are considered efficient when varying monotonously according to the azimuth
of the sound source. For each frequency, the PLL corresponds to the average of the variation of
H(f, <U+03B8>) or ILD(f, <U+03B8>) according to <U+03B8> in dB. So, the Potential Localization Level is a cumulated
measurement of variations of monaural cues across azimuth and a high PLL indicates a strong
variation of the considered cue with the position of the source.
3. Results 7
(a) HRTF cues in land- and air-water interface conditions
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc B 0000000
The HRTFs measured in the awake animals in both land- and interface conditions are displayed in
figure 2 (panels a-d). The HRTF intensity level is coded by an arbitrary coloured dB scale (from -12
to 8 dB arb., with contour lines representing 5 dB intervals), and expressed as both a function of
frequency (20 - 10000 Hz) and of the sound-source azimuth (–90 - +90 <U+25E6> ). Positive (resp. negative)
values of HRTF intensity level induce an amplification (resp. attenuation) of the acoustic field
due to the presence of the head of the animal compared to the calibration situation (i.e. with no
animal). Positive azimuth angles correspond to sounds recorded from the ipsilateral side, i.e. from
..........................................................
the side of the sound source, whereas negative azimuths correspond to the contralateral side, i.e.
sounds recorded in the ’acoustic shadow’ of the head.
In both land- and air-water interface conditions, HRTFs showed similar complex patterns of
sound pressure level variations, with high dynamics (20 dB) depending both on sound-source
incidence and sound frequency (figure 2a-d). This intensity pattern varied depending on the
side: for azimuths smaller than 0<U+25E6> (contraletral side), the sound level measured near the ear-
drum is negative whereas it appears mainly positive (i.e. amplified) for incidences larger than
0<U+25E6> (ipsilateral side). This main result indicates that the angular position of the sound source
influences the spectral cues perceived at the ears’ level, suggesting that HRTFs could support
sound source localization in both the land- and air-water interface conditions. The difference in
sound-pressure levels between the ears due to the position of the sound source was, however,
mainly present for frequencies above 1 kHz. Below 400 Hz, the sound-pressure level was mostly
invariant to sound-source position.
Beside this general picture, HRTFs were characterized by ’bumps’ and ’notches’ which may
increase the locatability of the sound source. Globally, the complexity of the HRTF patterns
increases with frequencies (figure 2). As the emitted sound signal showed equal levels across
the whole frequency spectrum, the variations of this level are due to the filtering effect of the
head. These complex shapes may underlie the complexity of the acoustic field surrounding the
animals’ head. For instance, when the Nile crocodile was in the land condition (figure 2a), the
sound-pressure level near 6 kHz was strongly influenced by the source angle (variations from -11
dB up to 6 dB), with a marked area of low levels when the source was positioned at -40<U+25E6> .
Overall, these results suggest that HRTF localization cues are already present near 1 kHz in
both land and interface conditions, and become more important when sound frequency increases.
This is further illustrated by the Potential Localization Levels (PLLs) displayed on figure 2e and
f. PLLs represent the amount of external acoustic localization cues measured at the tympanic
membrane level (see Methods). In accordance with HRTF results, PLLs increase exponentially
with sound frequency (i.e. linearly with the logarithm of the frequency). They look very similar
in both species and conditions (land condition: 2.7 dB/octave for the crocodile and 2.9 dB/octave
for the caiman; air-water interface condition: 2.4 and 2.5 dB/octave, respectively).
(b) Impact of skull size and acoustic coupling through the interaural canal
The HRTFs measured on the three skulls of Crocodylus niloticus are displayed on figure 3a-c.
Compared to those obtained in alive animals, HRTFs show mainly the same pattern with more
complex cues in high frequencies and a higher intensity level in the ipsilateral side. In the low
frequency range (f < 1kHz), it can be noticed that HRTF patterns appear more homogeneous in
contrast to those measured on alive animals. Nevertheless, the main difference is the presence
of a ’crescent shaped’ area of low sound-pressure level (underlined by the white continuous line
on the HRTF color maps in figure 3a-c). This pattern, consistently found in the three skulls, is
included in a frequency band which is directly dependent on the skull size (3.5 - 6.5 kHz, 2.5 - 8
6.5 kHz and 1.7 - 5.5 kHz for the small, medium and large skulls, respectively), and may be due
to destructive interferences caused by the interaural canal. Considering one ear, the difference of
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc B 0000000
pathway between the direct wave and the wave arriving from the other ear through the interaural
canal induces a phase difference F:
d
F = 2pf , (3.1)
c
where d is the difference of pathway in meters, c the sound velocity and f the frequency. From 3.1,
if F = p [2p], we can compute the frequencies corresponding to destructive interferences inside
..........................................................
the interaural canal fic :
c
fic = . (3.2)
2d
This simple geometrical model plotted on figure 3a-c indeed suggests that this pattern is due to
the interaural canal.
In line with what we found in alive animals, the effect of sound-source position on HRTFs
varied as a function of skull size. For instance, a 2 kHz sound produces complex level variation
that depended on the sound-source position in the larger skull (between –4 and +4 dB), while the
sound-pressure level remained constant for all azimuths (0 dB) for the small and medium skulls.
Moreover, the maximum sound-pressure level areas measured on the ipsilateral side extended to
a lower frequency range when skull size increased. For an incidence of 90<U+25E6> , the 3 dB contour line
starts at 4040 Hz, 3050 Hz and 2120 Hz for the small, medium and large skulls, respectively.
In skulls measurements, the Potential Localization Levels (PLLs) did not increase linearly with
the logarithm of the frequency (figure 3d) and it is not relevant to model its evolution using linear
regression. In the low frequency range (f < 1kHz), the PLLs remained almost steady around -
60 dB. For frequencies larger than 1 kHz, the PLLs increased with frequency in line with the
complexity of HRTF patterns. In skulls, HRTFs depended on the global shape of the head but
were also modified by the interaural canal, causing a non linear evolution of the PLLs.
(c) Binaural cues
Based on formula 2.1, PLLs were computed from ILDs and calculated using 2.5 (figure 4a and b).
As displayed in figure 4a-c, the PLLs calculated for alive animals increased monotonically with
the logarithm of frequency, with no noticeable impact of species or condition. The effect of head
size is emphasised by PLLs calculated from skulls. Thus for a 1 kHz sound, PLL is equal to -52, -49
and -38 dB for the small, medium and large skulls, respectively (figure 4c). ILDs are stronger for
frequencies higher than 1 kHz, with a sudden increase of the slope near 1 kHz of PLLs measured
on skulls.
We assessed ITDs on the medium size skull in only two conditions: the interaural canal was
either obstructed with an adhesive or opened (figure 4d). The ITDs results are very close to
those obtained by Carr et al. on Alligator mississipiensis [26]: ITDs are symmetrical to the normal
incidence and vary monotonically with the position of the sound source. When open (figure 4
right side of panel d), the interaural canal led to a decrease in ITDs, offering a shorter pathway to
acoustic waves. As a result, the maximum of ITD (at 90<U+25E6> ) is decreased by about 50 µs when the
canal is let free, independently from the frequency.
4. Discussion 9
Our study presents evidence that the morphology of the head of crocodilians induces monaural
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc B 0000000
and binaural acoustic cues available to the animal and potentially useful to obtain information
on the position of a sound source. These cues are still present when most of the animal body is
underwater, suggesting that the well-developed external ear formed by the horny and prominent
bone is efficient to provide external localization cues both on the land and at the interface. This
could represent an evolutionary adaptation to the peculiar amphibious behaviour of crocodilians.
Spectral monaural cues (HRTF) are present mainly for frequencies higher than 1 kHz. Their
saliency increases with sound frequency, and they are strongly influenced by head size, with a
..........................................................
shift to a lower frequency range in larger heads. Interestingly, we found that HRTFs cues are
very similar in both ’land-’ and ’air-water interface’ conditions. This suggests that the ability to
use monaural cues for sound source localization may be alike in both conditions, despite only
part of the crocodile’s head being exposed in the interface condition. Our investigations on skulls
underline the importance of the interaural canal, which creates destructive interferences that may
further facilitate sound-source localization. In additon to highlighting HRTF cues, we confirm the
presence of ILD cues (mainly for frequencies above 1 kHz) as well as ITD cues (mainly in the low
frequency range, below 1 kHz). Altogether, monaural and binaural cues may allow crocodilians
to accurately localize the position of a broadband sound source in their environment.
Overall, our results are consistent with Bierman et al. [21]. These authors concluded from their
measurements of external cues that the "acoustic space cues generated by the external morphology of
the animal are not sufficient to generate location cues that match physiological sensitivity" [21]. Indeed,
they demonstrated that the level of physiological sensitivity is due to the contributions of the
sound localization cues, the internal coupling of middle ears and the directionality of the eardrum.
However, Bierman et al. worked on very young alligators, with an interaural distance of 2.25
± 0.2 cm, whereas our animals showed interaural distances of 3.9 cm and 4.7 cm, respectively,
for the broad-snouted caiman and the Nile crocodile. The juvenile skull of Crocodylus niloticus
had interaural distances comparable to those of the alligators studied by Bierman et al. (2.4 cm).
Besides, they conducted their experiments for frequencies lower than 4 kHz and they obtained a
maximum variation of 8 dB (for a frequency of 2 kHz). In the same frequency range, we measured
a slightly higher dynamics of 9 dB maximum (cf. figures 2 and 3). In the present study, the
frequency span is increased up to 10 kHz because for high intensity sounds, the high frequencies
may be of interest for crocodilians. Indeed we cannot exclude the potential use of frequencies
higher than 2 kHz, and as we have strong dynamics (up to 20 dB), this frequency region may be
relevant for sound localization. Assuming the small size of the animals and that the external cues
are shifted to low frequency when size increases (figure 3), our results extend Bierman’s work and
is coherent with their results.
Given that the crocodilians’ audiogram is centred on the lower part of the frequency spectrum
(1-2 kHz, [8,9,27]) and that the external localization cues increase with frequency, the biological
relevance of the HRTFs has to be discussed. The frequency span used in our study was chosen
to widely cover the audition curve of crocodilians, and to illustrate the low-frequency shift
phenomena induced by size. If we consider the maximum of sensitivity of audition in crocodilians
(i.e. 1.5 kHz), the dynamics measured on external cues is more than 5 dB (figure 2), which is
potentially sufficient for sound localization. In blackbirds, pigeons and in sea lions the minimum
detectable binaural level difference is around 3dB [28,29] whereas it is 1 dB in humans [30].
Our study focused on two awake juvenile animals belonging to two different species.
However, the results could be extended to larger animals. Although we found a comparable
amount of potential localization cues in both experimental animals, slight differences in HRTFs
between species were visible in the upper part of the frequency spectrum. Studies in humans have
shown that individual morphology (i.e. rather small morphological differences) may significantly 10
influence HRTFs [31]. As both our animals had comparable body sizes, these differences may
have been induced by their respective head morphology (e.g. the Nile crocodile has a much more
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc B 0000000
slender snout than the caiman). In larger animals, these slight differences should be enhanced
and shifted towards lower frequencies. As a consequence, they may significantly influence HRTFs
within their hearing range.
Besides HRTFs, the internal acoustic coupling may increase sound localization because two
waves arrive at the same eardrum: one from the outside and one from the inside through the
interaural canal. The influences of this coupling were shown using a method of geometrical
acoustics on skulls (figure 3). The interaural canal also influences the ITD by decreasing its value
..........................................................
from 50 µs. While this result looks opposite to previous published data [32,33], it is explained
by the fact that we consider the interaural canal on skulls but without any soft tissue (such
as eardrums). The canal acts as a wave-guide without any obstacle to the propagation of the
acoustic wave. Bierman et al. demonstrated the implication of the directionality of the eardrums
on phyisiological relevance of ITD computation thanks to a laser vibrometry method [21].
ITDs are large in the low-frequency region (from 100 to 1000 Hz), whereas ILDs predominate
in the high frequencies region (f > 1500 Hz). In his duplex theory developed for humans [34],
Lord Rayleigh asserted that ITDs and ILDs ensure strong localization abilities across the full
auditory spectrum thanks to an overlap of both binaural cues between 1 and 1.5 kHz [35]. This
theory cannot be applied to all vertebrates: as an example, the barn owl combines ITD and ILD
information in the same frequency range (between 3 and 10 kHz) to localise respectively the
azimuth and the elevation [36,37]. In another way, crocodilians might also qualify this theory.
Carr et al. [26] demonstrated that ITD is not neurally processed for frequencies higher than 1 kHz
because of a lack of phase locking. As a consequence, ITDs and ILDs are weak in the band between
1 and 1.5 kHz, creating a lack of localization cues in this frequency region, at least for juvenile
and medium-sized crocodilians. The maximum of vibration of the eardrum was measured in this
precise bandwidth [21], which could be used to compensate this ’gap’ of localization.
As a conclusion, our results establish a strong background regarding the acoustic cues
available to crocodilians when they localize a sound source in their environment -a frequent
situation in several behavioural contexts, from predation to caring for the young. Our study
focused on aerial hearing. However, crocodilians are amphibious animals and previous studies
suggested a fairly good underwater hearing sensitivity. It would thus be interesting to investigate
sound localization cues in an underwater context. Finally, sound localization abilities remain also
poorly investigated and, even if a few behavioural observations in crocodilians were published
[13,38], the behavioural relevance of sound localization cues needs to be tested in following
research.
