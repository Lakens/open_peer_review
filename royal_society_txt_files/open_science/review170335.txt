I find the aim of this manuscript, to find common ground, laudable. I feel that the nature of the
disagreements between inclusive fitness theory's proponents and detractors is not entirely
accurately presented here, and some of the proposed resolutions have been made previously, but
nevertheless with some changes I think this manuscript would provide another useful view on
the status of the controversy and how to move past it.
Comments:

Page 13:
~line 28: here I would also cite Gardner et al. 2011 JEB (in the refs), Marshall 2015 (ditto) and
Marshall 2011 TREE (not) who, I think, both make a similar distinction between methods and IF
itself.
~line 34: I do not think that critics of IF believe kin selection occurs - the Nature article by Nowak,
Tarnita and Wilson (NTW) has at least three different agendas - I think Wilson's has long been
(since around 2005) to argue that kin selection is not a process that explains the evolution of
eusociality, etc. Wilson in particular focusses on evolution through trait group selection; other
authors (e.g. val Veelen) have proposed group selection as more general. So, if the author's
evaluation of where the main antagonists in the IF controversy are intellectually differs from
mine, I think more justification would be needed.
~line 36: here I think the author commits a category error than opens the door to more of the
same from the IF critics, by describing IF as a tool. As I and others argue, inclusive fitness is a
concept, and a biological quantity, but not a tool.
~line 50: I think that greenbeard traits do result in correlated interactions between genetic
relatives, or at least can be modelled as such. In Marshall 2015 different versions of Hamilton's
rule with different interpretations on relatedness and direct fitness costs are considered. Perhaps
it is easier in the text here to refer to correlated interactions between kin-group members.
Page 4:
~line 4: here IF is described as the property of an individual organism, i.e. not a tool (see previous
comment). Actually whether IF is a property of an individual or not is a subject of debate,
according to my interpretation. See, e.g. Okasha and Marten 2016 in Royal Society Open Science,
Ackay and van Cleeve and Ackay, 2016 in Phil Trans B. Both are concerned with what the IF
partition refers to in non-additive interactions, and whether it relates to a property, or expected
property, of any individual. I endorse neither viewpoint but suggest they are relevant for the
argument here and should be considered. It seems the only case in which the author's claim here
would be uncontroversial is in the additive fitness case; later in the manuscript they defend this
case as being biologically important, but recognise that it has been criticised, and defended, by
both sides of the debate.
~line 43: for me, Hamilton's rule is general because of this tautology, which is no worse than the
tautology of natural selection itself, or the Price equation; that which evolves is that which
reproduces more successfully.
Page 5:
~lines 25-27: I don't think inclusive fitness cares per se about what the causes of relatedness are; it
is simply a statement of whether a trait is net costly in direct fitness terms and whether that cost
is more than offset by indirect fitness benefits. The exception to this is when considering stability,
when -how- relatedness is generated -can- be crucial (e.g. selective pressure for falsebeards and
modifiers). I also don't think Allen et al. were making this point; they were saying HRG can
misdiagnose direct-fitness benefit as indirect fitness benefit, etc. through correlated characters.
3
Page 6:
lines ~38-46: under figure 1 in the first few two sentences I think the inequalities are incorrect;
indirect fitness requires c>0 and direct requires c<0. The third sentence seems correct (N.B. the
case c=0 is missing in my version of the inequalities; I don't think the case c = 0 should count as a
direct fitness explanation, since it is selectively neutral with respect to direct fitness (e.g. if r were
0 then the trait would be completely neutral).
~line 51: since HRG is derived from the Price equation why not cite that here where the full
version exclusively accounts for transmission bias, which could of course be selective at a
different level (e.g. Frank's rebellious child model, total Hamilton's rule, Marshall 2010 in BES,
etc.)
Page 7:
line ~10 (and fig 1): I think Hamilton should be given his due; from the beginning he had a
different but still explanatory taxonomy (i.e. altruism, cooperation, selfishness, and spite), in
terms of the signs of b and c. Where the taxonomy gets into causes of relatedness I am put more
in mind of Lehmann and Keller's 2006 attempt at a taxonomy in JEB. Personally I prefer not to
blur ultimate and proximate causal mechanisms (Marshall, 2010, BES). When it comes to breaking
down direct fitness benefits into immediate, or deferred, Queller's 'Kith, kin and kind' is relevant
(PNAS 2011).
Page 8:
~line 8: again, I would question if inclusive fitness is always a property of an individual organism
(see above).
~line 26: again, Okasha and Martens on causal interpretation of HR with synergy relevant here.
Page 10:
~line 13: but deriving HRG, which the author seems to support, depends on partitioning non-
additive effects (e.g. Garner et al. 2011 JEB)
~line 32: here I think Grafen made assumptions of additivity in order to facilitate his optimisation
program approach as applied to IF.
~line 49: however NTW and others explicitly complain about weak-selection assumptions, and
proponents of IF (e.g. Abbott et al., Gardner et al., Marshall) defend it. I personally think that
separating what tends to happen in biology from what the limits of theory are is useful. For me,
while I found the relation of Hamilton back to Fisher's and Darwin's gradualism (via a quote that
I had not previously seen) to be illuminating, the theorist in me remains unhappy with going
back to the Fisher's microscope argument as a defence (which has been around for decades, e.g.
Grafen's 'Hamilton's rule OK' in Nature in response to Queller's first non-additive extension of
HR, based on introducing an additional coefficient).
Page 15:
~line 8: as theorists we often like to play the phenotypic gambit, but don't forget that fitness
landscapes are problematic and the genetic bases of traits cannot be ignored (Moran, On the non-
existence of adaptive topographies).
~line 32: I would also ask what Allen et al. mean by 'understand' - this is precisely the point I
tried to make in my COBS paper in 2016 (cited).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The purpose of this article is to discuss the criticisms and defenses of Hamilton’s rule and
inclusive fitness as a part of the ongoing debate on the scientific merits of inclusive fitness theory.
The author provides a broad summary of both topics and embeds each historically in the contexts
in which they arose. As an invited article for this special issue, I find that the paper surveys the
literature well and presents an admirably balanced view of both sides of the debate.
After acknowledging the shortcomings of Hamilton’s rule “general” (or “genic”), denoted
“HRG,” highlighted in recent literature, the author argues that HRG is best viewed as an
organizational framework. This argument is reminiscent of similar reasoning used for the Price
equation. One thing that would be nice to see in this paper is an analogy between the author’s
line of thought on HRG and similar viewpoints on the Price equation. For example, Doebeli et al.
(eLife, 2017) argue that “…the Price equation is not really a model, but a useful data visualization
tool.” It seems that HRG is like the Price equation in this respect.
What is unclear in the article is what is meant by the word “explanation” (pages 5-6). I agree that
one can always place positive change somewhere in Figure 1, but this placement seems to be with
respect to purely mathematical quantities (b, c, r). The way direct/indirect “fitness explanation”
is used here looks more like a definition than anything else. It would be nice if the author could
comment on the extent to which Figure 1 and the terms contained therein are to be interpreted
formally. Furthermore, in line with using HRG as an organizational framework and previous
examples showing that the results of HRG need not reflect the biology (Allen et al., PNAS, 2013),
could the author briefly comment on what information and/or assumptions would be needed to
make meaningful biological conclusions from HRG (and Figure 1)?
Regarding the sections on inclusive fitness, I liked the historical context and the detailed
explanation of \delta-weak selection. As the author has pointed out, this assumption often
appears as if it’s made just to make the theory “work.” The discussion of this aspect gives a
balanced overview without the appearance of taking one side or the other.
When reading the section on inclusive fitness, I was wondering how the article “There is no
fitness but fitness, and the lineage is its bearer” (Akcay and Van Cleve, 2016) fits in. For example,
in that paper the authors argue that inclusive fitness really isn’t just a property of the individual,
which appears to contradict the idea that it is attached to an individual organism as summarized
here. Similarly, in the article “There is no inclusive fitness at the level of the individual” (Allen
and Nowak, 2016) and the references therein [7,8,10,11,12], it is also argued that inclusive fitness
is not an individual-level quantity and that natural selection does not maximize inclusive fitness.
A discussion of these ideas would benefit the author’s summary of inclusive fitness.
5
While I do not agree with all the ideas put forth in this article, I do think it makes for a good
contribution to a special issue on the debate for and against inclusive fitness and HRG. Therefore,
I recommend publication following revisions in line with the above comments.

Appendix A
Dear Alice,
Thanks for inviting me to submit a revision of this manuscript. I thank both reviewers for their detailed
and helpful comments. All their suggestions have been implemented. This is a topic that tends to attract
heated disagreement, but in this case both reviewers have been very constructive, so their suggestions
can be implemented without contradiction.
In short, I have added 20 references and have made revisions of varying degrees to 18 paragraphs. All
these changes can be viewed using “track changes" in the submitted Word document. Below, I briefly
outline the changes I have made in response to the reviewer’s comments.
Reviewer 1

2011 TREE (not) who, I think, both make a similar distinction between methods and IF itself.
—> I have cited Gardner et al. (2011) and Marshall (2015) here (I think citing Marshall’s book here is
sufficient and that it is not necessary to also cite the 2011 paper).
~line 34: I do not think that critics of IF believe kin selection occurs - the Nature article by Nowak,
Tarnita and Wilson (NTW) has at least three different agendas - I think Wilson's has long been (since
around 2005) to argue that kin selection is not a process that explains the evolution of eusociality, etc.
Wilson in particular focusses on evolution through trait group selection; other authors (e.g. van Veelen)
have proposed group selection as more general. So, if the author's evaluation of where the main
antagonists in the IF controversy are intellectually differs from mine, I think more justification would be
needed.
—> It is true that, in addition to the theoretical and conceptual aspects of the controversy, there are
empirical disagreements about the importance of kin selection in explaining particular biological
phenomena, such as the evolution of eusociality. I have noted this in the revised manuscript. However,
these empirical disagreements are not my focus in this article, and I have also noted this and explained
why. Incidentally, I do think even Wilson acknowledges that kin selection occurs in at least some cases:
the 2005 Holldobler and Wilson article discusses kin selection as a factor secondary to group selection
that may be “weakly binding or weakly dissolutive, according to circumstance”.
~line 36: here I think the author commits a category error than opens the door to more of the same
from the IF critics, by describing IF as a tool. As I and others argue, inclusive fitness is a concept, and a
biological quantity, but not a tool.
—> The revised manuscript says “conceptual and theoretical framework”.
~line 50: I think that greenbeard traits do result in correlated interactions between genetic relatives, or
at least can be modelled as such. In Marshall 2015 different versions of Hamilton's rule with different
interpretations on relatedness and direct fitness costs are considered. Perhaps it is easier in the text
here to refer to correlated interactions between kin-group members.
Page 4:
—> The revised manuscript says “correlation interaction between biological kin in the ordinary sense of
the word”.
~line 4: here IF is described as the property of an individual organism, i.e. not a tool (see previous
comment). Actually whether IF is a property of an individual or not is a subject of debate, according to
my interpretation. See, e.g. Okasha and Marten 2016 in Royal Society Open Science, Ackay and van
Cleeve and Ackay, 2016 in Phil Trans B. Both are concerned with what the IF partition refers to in non-
additive interactions, and whether it relates to a property, or expected property, of any individual. I
endorse neither viewpoint but suggest they are relevant for the argument here and should be
considered. It seems the only case in which the author's claim here would be uncontroversial is in the
additive fitness case; later in the manuscript they defend this case as being biologically important, but
recognise that it has been criticised, and defended, by both sides of the debate.
—> I have now cited Ackay and van Cleve as defenders of the view that inclusive fitness is a property of
a lineage, not an individual organism — while also emphasizing that Hamilton regarded inclusive fitness
as a property of an individual organism. My main interest in Section 3 is arguing for the value of
inclusive fitness as Hamilton conceived it.
Page 5:
~lines 25-27: I don't think inclusive fitness cares per se about what the causes of relatedness are; it is
simply a statement of whether a trait is net costly in direct fitness terms and whether that cost is more
than offset by indirect fitness benefits. The exception to this is when considering stability, when -how-
relatedness is generated -can- be crucial (e.g. selective pressure for falsebeards and modifiers). I also
don't think Allen et al. were making this point; they were saying HRG can misdiagnose direct- fitness
benefit as indirect fitness benefit, etc. through correlated characters.
—> My point here is simply that, to give a causal explanation of change in any particular biological case,
one should cite the causes of relatedness (limited dispersal, kin recognition, etc.) and not just state that
relatedness is positive. You are not giving a causal explanation of change if you merely state that a
statistical condition for change is satisfied. A causal explanation needs to include some of the causal
detail that HRG deliberately omits. I have added some citations regarding the important point that the
source of relatedness makes a difference to the stability of a trait.
Strictly speaking, I don’t attribute this point to Allen et al., but it is why I think they are justified in their
assertion that HRG does not, by itself, provide causal explanations of change. What HRG does instead is
provide an organizing framework for causal explanations of change.
Page 6:
lines ~38-46: under figure 1 in the first few two sentences I think the inequalities are incorrect; indirect
fitness requires c>0 and direct requires c<0. The third sentence seems correct (N.B. the case c=0 is
missing in my version of the inequalities; I don't think the case c = 0 should count as a direct fitness
explanation, since it is selectively neutral with respect to direct fitness (e.g. if r were 0 then the trait
would be completely neutral).
—> Thanks. Yes, this paragraph was riddled with typos, now corrected.
~line 51: since HRG is derived from the Price equation why not cite that here where the full version
exclusively accounts for transmission bias, which could of course be selective at a different level (e.g.
Frank's rebellious child model, total Hamilton's rule, Marshall 2010 in BES, etc.)
—> I have included a parenthetical comment to this effect.
line ~10 (and fig 1): I think Hamilton should be given his due; from the beginning he had a different but
still explanatory taxonomy (i.e. altruism, cooperation, selfishness, and spite), in terms of the signs of b
and c. Where the taxonomy gets into causes of relatedness I am put more in mind of Lehmann and
Keller's 2006 attempt at a taxonomy in JEB. Personally I prefer not to blur ultimate and proximate
causal mechanisms (Marshall, 2010, BES). When it comes to breaking down direct fitness benefits into
immediate, or deferred, Queller's 'Kith, kin and kind' is relevant (PNAS 2011).
—> I don’t discuss Hamilton’s four-part schema in this paper (although I do in my forthcoming book); I
see it as aiming at a different target, since it is a scheme for categorizing particular behaviours rather
than explanations/models. Lehmann and Keller (2006) is indeed a relevant citation here and I have
added it (along with Queller 2011).
Page 8:
~line 8: again, I would question if inclusive fitness is always a property of an individual organism (see
above).
—> In the revised manuscript this debate is noted and explained, but then set aside in order to focus on
inclusive fitness as Hamilton (1964) defined it.
~line 26: again, Okasha and Martens on causal interpretation of HR with synergy relevant here.
—> Citation added.
~line 13: but deriving HRG, which the author seems to support, depends on partitioning non-additive
effects (e.g. Garner et al. 2011 JEB)
—> It is important here to distinguish HRG (a statistical, population-level result which still holds in the
non-additive case) from inclusive fitness qua property of an individual organism, which is quite a bit
harder to reconcile with non-additivity. I have added a comment to this effect.
~line 32: here I think Grafen made assumptions of additivity in order to facilitate his optimisation
program approach as applied to IF.
—> Yes — and what he needs for that project is for inclusive fitness to be a well-defined property of an
individual organism, because it must be a property of an individual in order to provide a ‘design
objective’ for the individual’s phenotype. So it is no coincidence that both Hamilton and Grafen invoke
substantial additivity assumptions.
~line 49: however NTW and others explicitly complain about weak-selection assumptions, and
proponents of IF (e.g. Abbott et al., Gardner et al., Marshall) defend it. I personally think that separating
what tends to happen in biology from what the limits of theory are is useful. For me, while I found the
relation of Hamilton back to Fisher's and Darwin's gradualism (via a quote that I had not previously
seen) to be illuminating, the theorist in me remains unhappy with going back to the Fisher's microscope
argument as a defence (which has been around for decades, e.g. Grafen's 'Hamilton's rule OK' in Nature
in response to Queller's first non-additive extension of HR, based on introducing an additional
coefficient).
—> I think it’s helpful to understand the source of Hamilton’s gradualism. There is an intellectual lineage
here and a commitment to gradualism has been passed along that lineage; thus the influence of Fisher
can still be felt in contemporary IF theory.
Page 15:
~line 8: as theorists we often like to play the phenotypic gambit, but don't forget that fitness landscapes
are problematic and the genetic bases of traits cannot be ignored (Moran, On the non-existence of
adaptive topographies).
—> I have included a comment to this effect (citing my own review article on this topic, which cites
Moran).
Reviewer 2
"1. After acknowledging the shortcomings of Hamilton’s rule “general” (or “genic”), denoted “HRG,”
highlighted in recent literature, the author argues that HRG is best viewed as an organizational
framework. This argument is reminiscent of similar reasoning used for the Price equation. One thing that
would be nice to see in this paper is an analogy between the author’s line of thought on HRG and similar
viewpoints on the Price equation. For example, Doebeli et al. (eLife, 2017) argue that “...the Price
equation is not really a model, but a useful data visualization tool.” It seems that HRG is like the Price
equation in this respect."
—> In the revised manuscript, I note that HRG is derived from the Price equation and I point out that
the Price equation itself can also be regarded as providing an organizing framework, but that it partitions
change at a coarser grain of analysis than HRG (since it partitions change into a selective component
and a transmission bias component, without further partitioning the selective component). I have added
relevant references including Doebeli et al. I prefer to interpret these principles as “organizing
frameworks” rather than “data visualisation tools”.
"2. What is unclear in the article is what is meant by the word “explanation” (pages 5-6). I agree that
one can always place positive change somewhere in Figure 1, but this placement seems to be with
respect to purely mathematical quantities (b, c, r). The way direct/indirect “fitness explanation” is used
here looks more like a definition than anything else. It would be nice if the author could comment on the
extent to which Figure 1 and the terms contained therein are to be interpreted formally. Furthermore, in
line with using HRG as an organizational framework and previous examples showing that the results of
HRG need not reflect the biology (Allen et al., PNAS, 2013), could the author briefly comment on what
information and/or assumptions would be needed to make meaningful biological conclusions from HRG
(and Figure 1)?"
—> I have included some relevant citations on causality and causal explanation, and I have added some
additional explanation of what I mean when I say “HRG does not, by itself, provide causal explanations
of change”. The idea is that a causal explanation is provided by a dynamical model that specifies the
payoff structure and population structure. HRG provides a framework for organizing such models in
terms of their implied commitments regarding the signs of r, b, and c.
I have also added a paragraph briefly discussing the Allen et al. examples. These examples highlight the
pitfalls of interpreting b and c as measures of direct causal influence, but I do not regard them as
undermining the use of HRG as an organizing framework in the above sense, because the use of HRG as
an organizing framework does not require that b and c measure direct causal influence.
"3. When reading the section on inclusive fitness, I was wondering how the article “There is no fitness
but fitness, and the lineage is its bearer” (Akcay and Van Cleve, 2016) fits in. For example, in that paper
the authors argue that inclusive fitness really isn’t just a property of the individual, which appears to
contradict the idea that it is attached to an individual organism as summarized here. "
—> This is cited and its relation to the present discussion is noted (as also requested by Reviewer 1).
Here I am focussing on inclusive fitness as Hamilton conceived it: a property of an individual organism.
"Similarly, in the article “There is no inclusive fitness at the level of the individual” (Allen and Nowak,
2016) and the references therein [7,8,10,11,12], it is also argued that inclusive fitness is not an
individual-level quantity and that natural selection does not maximize inclusive fitness. A discussion of
these ideas would benefit the author’s summary of inclusive fitness."
—> This claim and the reasons behind it are now mentioned. If one thinks Hamilton’s additivity
assumptions are in general false, one will be led to think inclusive fitness does not exist in the real world
as a property of an individual organism. I think, however, that if these assumptions are approximately
true in processes of cumulative adaptation by delta-weak selection, then inclusive fitness at the level of
the individual exists in this context and, moreover, has a useful function as a criterion for improvement.
Let me know if you would like any further detail on these revisions.
