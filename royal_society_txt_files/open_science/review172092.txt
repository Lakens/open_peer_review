This paper used network theory to analyze the co-movement of real estate industry related
stocks. Specifically, the cointegration and Granger causality relationships are analyzed to form
links between nodes (stocks). The results are technically sound and could prove to be practical in
policy making. I suggest the paper to be published given that the following issues are clarified or
answered.
1. page 9, paragraph 2. The authors deducted from the fact that the connectivity of the
cointegration network is "good" (actually this connectivity can be fine tuned by setting the
significance level) to the "provoking" thought that "it is necessary to understand the
microstructure". The logic here seems a little bit confusing.
2. page 17, the last paragraph. "the results show the diffusion path of the fluctuation when one
industry fluctuates suddenly." I cannot find the description of the data which the authors used to
conduct their research. But, presumably, the data should cover a long period of time during
which the stock market must experience both normal fluctuations and sudden shocks. Therefore,
I doubt if the authors' result would show specifically the diffusion path when one industry
"fluctuates suddenly."
3. Table 1. Are the distributions of stock prices in bell shapes? If not, there is no need to calculate
the standard deviations as they might give no useful information.
4. After equations (1), (2), (4)... if the following sentence starts with a "where", please use no
indents on that paragraph.
5. Equations (3), (5). Please use normal font on the text in the equations.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In the work entitled “Modelling cointegration and Granger causality network to detect long-term
equilibrium and diffusion paths in financial system,” the authors proposed two networks, i.e.,
conintegration and Granger-causality networks, for analyzing the long-range and short-range
correlations among 309 stocks from six sectors in the Chinese stock market. This study is well-
written and is easily to follow. Prior to the final recommendation, I have the following comments
and hope the authors will find some of them useful.
1. Literature. (1) As I know, the cointegration network was proposed by Tu (2014) (Physica A 402,
245-254) and Yang et al. (2014) (Physica A, 400, 168-185) for examining the relationships among
stocks or stock markets. I also note some differences between your model and the above two
approaches. Thus I suggest the authors could present the differences between them in the
introduction. (2) When citing the references, only the surname is needed. For example, “Anas
AArnott RJ” -> “Anas and Arnott”, and “Jiang XM, Mai YHWang SY” -> “Jiang et al.”
2. Data set. The authors used 309 stocks from the Chinese stock market in the empirical study.
However, they did not show the sample range (i.e., time period) and the data source. I hope the
authors could address this concern.
3. Method. In Fig. 1, the authors show the flowchart of the two proposed networks. From Section
3.1 and Fig. 1, I see that the cointegration network is constructed based on stock prices if the
pairwise stock prices have the long-run conintegration relationship using the Johansen
cointegration test by the VAR model. This step is sound sense. Here my major concern is the the
Granger-causality network if the authors used the stock prices, because in general the stock prices
are non-stationary and thus we usually use the returns (which are stationary) for examining the
short-term relationship based on the Granger-causality test.
4. Equation. About the definition of caus_{i,j}, I think it should have a direction description. For
example, “caus_{i,j} indicates whether there is significant Granger-causality from stock i to stock
j” and “there is significant Granger causality from stock j to stock i” (in Eq. 5). Note that I am not
sure my above direction is right.
5. Significant level. The authors construct the two networks by econometric approaches. If there
are significant cointegration or Granger-causality relation between two stocks, a link is drawn
between the two stocks or from one stock to another. However, the authors did not state the
significant level (e.g., 1% or 5%) when constructing the two networks.
6. Typos. For example, in line 19 of page 13, “and” should be “to”. In line 39 of page 14, “the
cointegration network” should be “the Granger-causality network”. About authors’ contribution,
I think lines 29-30/31 on page 19 should be dropped.

Dear editors and reviewers:
We appreciate your consideration and the reviewers’ insightful comments. Now we have
carefully revised the manuscript entitled “Modelling cointegration and Granger
causality network to detect long-term equilibrium and diffusion paths in financial
system” (RSOS-172092) according the reviewers’ comments. These comments are
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper. The main corrections in
this paper and the point-to-point responses to the reviewers’ comments are as follows:
Reviewer 1:
This paper used network theory to analyze the co-movement of real estate industry
related stocks. Specifically, the cointegration and Granger causality relationships are
analyzed to form links between nodes (stocks). The results are technically sound and
could prove to be practical in policy making. I suggest the paper to be published given
that the following issues are clarified or answered.
1. page 9, paragraph 2. The authors deducted from the fact that the connectivity of the
cointegration network is "good" (actually this connectivity can be fine tuned by setting
the significance level) to the "provoking" thought that "it is necessary to understand the
microstructure". The logic here seems a little bit confusing.
Response: Thank you very much for the positive suggestion and the comments. As
reviewer said, the connectivity of the cointegration network can be tuned by setting the
significance level. The significance level is a kind of threshold value. Generally, the
significance level is often set as 1%, 5% or 10%. 5% is the most utilized in the studies.
Thus, in this manuscript, we chose 5% as the significance level threshold value for
building the cointegration network.
Because most current studies have focused on the issues of the impact of the real estate
industry on other industries in the national economy from a macroscopic perspective or at
the industry level. They chose the macroscopic indexes for representing the development
1
status of the industries, and they set these macroscopic indexes as variables for modelling.
Then, these studies obtained that there exists cointegration between real estate industry
and other industries from the macroscopic (industry) perspective. However, dose the
cointegration always exist between industries from the microscopic perspective? As
we know, one industry contains lots of companies. Dose the cointegration always exist
between these companies? Although lots of results showed that there existed
cointegration between different industries, our study showed that the cointegration did
not always exist from the microscopic perspective (company level). The density of the
cointegration network is only 0.175, which means that most of the relationships between
companies are not cointegration. But the connectivity of the cointegration network is
good. Because the average path length and the diameter of the network is short. Thus,
based on the cointegration network, the fluctuation of any variable can spread
conveniently.
All in all, there exist cointegration between industries from the macroscopic perspective,
but the cointegration do not always exist from the microscopic perspective. Thus, it is
necessary to understand the microstructure of the cointegration network for obtaining
more details of the relationships between industries. We have revised the logic of this
part.
2. page 17, the last paragraph. "the results show the diffusion path of the fluctuation when
one industry fluctuates suddenly." I cannot find the description of the data which the
authors used to conduct their research. But, presumably, the data should cover a long
period of time during which the stock market must experience both normal fluctuations
and sudden shocks. Therefore, I doubt if the authors' result would show specifically the
diffusion path when one industry "fluctuates suddenly."
Response: Thank you for pointing out the problem. We are sorry for the blurry
description of this part. Actually, the results did not show the special diffusion path when
on industry fluctuates suddenly. The results showed the diffusion path between the
industries under different thresholds. As shown in Figure 8, the diffusion paths are
different under different thresholds.
We have revised the description of the related sentences.

3. Table 1. Are the distributions of stock prices in bell shapes? If not, there is no need to
calculate the standard deviations as they might give no useful information.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We agree with your comment and we have
deleted the standard deviations column in the Table 1.
4. After equations (1), (2), (4)... if the following sentence starts with a "where", please use
no indents on that paragraph.
Response: We have deleted the indents before the “where”.
5. Equations (3), (5). Please use normal font on the text in the equations.
Response: We have revised the format of the text in the equations.
6. Figure 4. The use of "frequency" on "degree interval" is suggested to be changed by
"probability". Same for the "cumulative frequency" in the nested graph.
Response: We have revised the expression in the Figure 4.
7. page 11, the last paragraph. Please cite the "current studies".
Response: We have cited the literatures in the paragraph.
8. page 13, the last paragraph. "power-law distribution" is suggested to be changed by
"long-tail distribution" as the authors have not tested it rigorously.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We have changed “power-law distribution” to
“long-tail distribution”.
9. page 14, second paragraph. It would be interesting to see the names of a few
representative stocks in each quadrant here.
Response: We have added some names of the representative stocks in each quadrant. We
also provide the Supplementary Table S1 for more information.
10. page 17, the last paragraph. the "extend" of Granger causality -> the "threshold" of ...

Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We have changed “extent of Granger causality”
to the “threshold of Granger causality”.
Reviewer 2:
In the work entitled “Modelling cointegration and Granger causality network to detect
long-term equilibrium and diffusion paths in financial system,” the authors proposed two
networks, i.e., cointegration and Granger-causality networks, for analyzing the long-range
and short-range correlations among 309 stocks from six sectors in the Chinese stock
market. This study is well-written and is easily to follow. Prior to the final
recommendation, I have the following comments and hope the authors will find some of
them useful.
1. Literature. (1) As I know, the cointegration network was proposed by Tu (2014)
(Physica A 402, 245-254) and Yang et al. (2014) (Physica A, 400, 168-185) for examining
the relationships among stocks or stock markets. I also note some differences between
your model and the above two approaches. Thus I suggest the authors could present the
differences between them in the introduction. (2) When citing the references, only the
surname is needed. For example, “Anas AArnott RJ” -> “Anas and Arnott”, and “Jiang
XM, Mai YHWang SY” -> “Jiang et al.”
Response: Thank you for the suggestion and the literatures recommendation. We have
learned the literatures carefully, and we have added the discussion in the “Step 2.
Cointegration test” in the “3.2 Methods” part, as following:
Some researchers have established the stock complex network based on cointegration test
[41, 42]. However, they utilized the Engle–Granger method for the cointegration test. The
Engle–Granger method is based on the residual test, but the Johansen cointegration test
is based on the regression parameters test. Engle–Granger method assumes that one
variable is endogenous and the other is exogenous, which does not allow for the possible
endogeneity of the regressors. But the Johansen cointegration test allows all variables to
be endogenous. And the Johansen cointegration test has greater power than
Engle–Granger method [43, 44]. Thus, we can utilize the Johansen cointegration test
method based on the vector autoregression model (VAR) for testing the cointegration
4
relationship between variables.
Moreover, we have revised the style of citing the references in the main body.
2. Data set. The authors used 309 stocks from the Chinese stock market in the empirical
study. However, they did not show the sample range (i.e., time period) and the data
source. I hope the authors could address this concern.
Response: We have added the sample range and the data source in the 3.1 Materials. We
selected the stock closing prices for the real estate industry (REI), steel industry (SI),
building materials industry (BMI), construction products and engineering industry (CPEI),
banking industry (BI) and household durable consumer goods industry (HDCGI) in the
China stock market as sample data. There was a total of 309 stock price time series. Each
stock price time series contain 200 daily data points in 2016. We collected all of data
from Wind Economic Database.
3. Method. In Fig. 1, the authors show the flowchart of the two proposed networks. From
Section 3.1 and Fig. 1, I see that the cointegration network is constructed based on stock
prices if the pairwise stock prices have the long-run conintegration relationship using the
Johansen cointegration test by the VAR model. This step is sound sense. Here my major
concern is the Granger-causality network if the authors used the stock prices, because in
general the stock prices are non-stationary and thus we usually use the returns (which are
stationary) for examining the short-term relationship based on the Granger-causality test.
Response: Thank you for pointing this issue. As reviewer said, we usually use the
stationary time series for examining the Granger-causality. However, in the manuscript,
we tested the Granger-causality based on the cointegration test. Because the aim of the
cointegration test is to avoid the spurious regression between variables. Thus, we firstly
test the cointegration relationships between the pairwise stock prices, and then we test the
Granger-causality based on the cointegration relationships. As shown in Fig. 1, if there
exist cointegration between two variables, we do the Granger-causality test. If there does
not exist cointegration between two variables, the Granger-causality test is meaningless.
That is to say, we filter the cointegration network by Granger-causality test.

4. Equation. About the definition of caus_{i,j}, I think it should have a direction
description. For example, “caus_{i,j} indicates whether there is significant
Granger-causality from stock i to stock j” and “there is significant Granger causality from
stock j to stock i” (in Eq. 5). Note that I am not sure my above direction is right.
Response: We have revised the description based on reviewer’s suggestion. “caus_{i,j}
indicates whether stock i Granger cause stock j significantly” and “stock i Granger cause
stock j significantly” in Eq. 5.
5. Significant level. The authors construct the two networks by econometric approaches.
If there are significant cointegration or Granger-causality relation between two stocks, a
link is drawn between the two stocks or from one stock to another. However, the authors
did not state the significant level (e.g., 1% or 5%) when constructing the two networks.
Response: We chose the significant level as 5%. We stated the significant level in the
“Step 2. Cointegration test”, the “Step 4. Granger causality test” and the “Step 5. The
Granger causality network model building.” in the “3.2 Methods” part.
6. Typos. For example, in line 19 of page 13, “and” should be “to”. In line 39 of page 14,
“the cointegration network” should be “the Granger-causality network”. About authors’
contribution, I think lines 29-30/31 on page 19 should be dropped.
Response: Thank you for the comments. We have revised them in the manuscript.
We find that the reviewers’ comments are quite helpful for improving the paper, and
we have revised our paper point-by-point. Once again, thank you very much for the
comments and suggestions!
