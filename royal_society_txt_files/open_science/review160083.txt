Authors introduce an eco-epidemiological model that is aimed at describing the interactions of
police and gangs. A modified predator-prey model is used as the basis for the new model, and
based on an extensive stability analysis and numerical simulations, conditions are determined
when crime is likely to proliferate and vice versa.
Altogether, I have enjoyed reading this manuscript, and it is my opinion that it is a good work
that is worth publishing in an interdisciplinary journal like Royal Society Open Science. A
revision along the following comments should nevertheless be considered.
1) The title is catchy, but maybe a bit too imprecise. There is little eco-epidemiological about the
considered model. Please note that predator-prey models have been used for all sorts of different
phenomena. It would be better to just refer to the model as a modified predator-prey model,
rather than an eco-epidemiological model.
2) Quie a bit more has been done on the subject of crime modeling as is currently acknowledged
in the first paragraph of the introduction. The authors have altogether missed agent-based
modeling, as used in Understanding recurrent crime as system-immanent collective behavior,
PLoS ONE 8, e76063 (2013) and Saving human lives: What complexity science and information
systems can contribute, D. Helbing, et al., J. Stat. Phys. 158, 735-781 (2015), as well as the recent
review on the subject Statistical physics of crime: A review, M. R. D'Orsogna, M. Perc, Phys. Life
Rev. 12, 1-21 (2015)
3) It would also improve the quality and clarity of the paper if the figure captions would be made
more self-contained. What is the main message of the figure could be stated in a sentence or two.
4) I am worried about the clarity of some of the figures. The lines are very thin, and the axis
labeling is also rather imprecise in relation to the notation introduced in the main part of the
paper. This could be improved.

I have studied the manuscript: “Eco-epidemiological Model for the Interaction of Police and
Gangs” by Sooknanan, Bhatt and Comissiong. Here the authors present and discuss a model for
describing the interaction between police control and gangs. Despite I believing the results are
somehow interesting (due to my research interests), I’m not convinced that this manuscript is
suitable for the present journal.
The model has an exhaustive list of assumptions; some are intuitive, but others seem not properly
justified (such as ruling out the stochastic effects). Also, there are too many technical details that I
believe can be suppressed, providing focus on the results. The absence of data and model
validation lets the reader somehow lost in the smog of model parameters.
The authors could try sending their results to a more specialized journal (perhaps a more
mathematical one), where the readers may find their results more interesting.

label_comment_3
At first I started to read this paper with interest, then my
arms sank, in the end I was a bit releaved, but am still oscillating
between an outright rejection and a major revision.
The problem is that the topic is very interesting, but im my
opinion at times the paper is written sloppily. The first thing
that makes me upset is the mixing of biological and sociological
4
language. Once at the outset the authors identify criminals with
diseased people, it is enough to continue to talk about corrupted
persons and not label them as "infected", because that is just
misleading. The parallel between the fields is OK at the beginning,
but should not be mixed up all the time.
In this respect, see e.g. P. 5 l. 35: police are always "hungry"!
Another thing is that throughout the paper, most of the times
by "police" the authors mean policemen or police officers, not
the "police body".
The thing that bothers me most, however is the fact that in the
formulation, it is said that the number of policemen is constant, P,
and that is a fundamental fact for the subsequent analysis. But summing
the equations (P. 3) for S_P amd I_P one gets
S_P' + I_P' = -g_1 and not equal to 0.
This is explained only much later after discussing the form for g_1,
to say that alpha_3=0, which is the same as taking g_1=0 in the first
place. I think this is overdoing. Either you keep P constant and
forget about police fighting corrupted policemen, or you consider
this and drop the assumption that S_P + I_P = constant.
P. 3 l. 22: the parameters are assumed nonnegative, this has nothing
to do with the nonnegativity of the solutions of the model!
Eqs (3,1)-(3.5) should be omitted,
referring to them simply as "the equilibrium
equations" of the model. And the latter P, 2 lines 49 onwards,
should be labeled!!!
Coexistence equilibrium. It is in fact NOT calculated, where is
the value of Z? In discussing it, perhaps sufficient conditions
for its existence could be attempted.
What is the need of (3.8)? Isn't the Jacobian sufficent for
the stability?
Why there cannot be Hopf bifurcations for E_1? Explain better!
In the bifurcation analysis, one of the Figures should
show all the populations.
Minor points:
P. 2 l. 21 (prey) NOT preys!
P. 5 l. 23: number of GANGSTERS (in my opinion) captured.
P. 11 l. 23: Hopf (capitalized)
P. 16 l. 51: death RATE

Further revisions are necessary because the authors did not take any of the comments really
seriously; neither mine nor that of the other referees. I also do not care much for their single-
sentence replies to most of the comments that were communicated to them. Either do the revision
well, or send your paper elsewhere.
A comprehensive and complete introduction is of paramount importance for any paper. I do not
care if 2 other papers on agent-based modelling have already been cited before. That is not the
point. The point is to provide the interdisciplinary readership of the journal with a proper
introduction to the field, and since this paper has to do with modeling of crime, the two
mentioned recent reviews should be of interest (despite the fact that 2 other papers already give
some credit to agent-based models). The figure captions are still not what one would have hoped
for. In fact, not much has been added at all, and as a reader I am still struggling with the meaning
of displayed curves. The same for the table captions.

I have studied the amended version of the manuscript "Eco-epidemiological Model for the
Interaction of Police and Gangs", which is now titled "A Modified Predator-Prey Model for the
Interaction of Police and Gangs". I find that this version was considerably improved, especially
due the comments of the Rev. #2 and the academic editor.
As before, this new version is performed at a high enough technical standard. Also, the subject is
worth to be investigated, interesting (in my opinion) and, as stated by the authors, it may
represent a "new take" on modeling criminal behavior. A fact that I had missed in my first report.
I still find that there are too many technical details in the text and that it will reduce the visibility
of the manuscript for a broader audience; however, it seems that the authors consider that this
level of detail is necessary. I'm not totally sure, but perhaps moving part of the "calculations" to
an appendix will make the paper more fluid. For instance, when reading most of section 3, I
already got the impression of reading an appendix.
Having said that and also taking into account the academic editor comments, I recommend the
publication of this new version.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
Authors have submitted a revised manuscript that is improved in many of the points I mentioned
earlier. Nevertheless, some issues remain that require further revision.
1) In the Introduction, the authors mis-cite reference 10. The correct reference is M. R. D'Orsogna
and M. Perc, Statistical physics of crime: A review, Phys. Life Rev. 12 (2015) 1-21. Currently it
seems the authors cite a comment to that review. That is fine too, but the original review should
be cited, and the comment then has other authors.
2) In terms of agent-based models and crime, the recent approach based on the inspection game,
as presented in Understanding recurrent crime as system-immanent collective behavior, PLoS
ONE 8 (2013) e76063, deserves mentioning.
3) In the conclusions, the authors state that the model is among the first attempts that we could
find to model the spread of gangs. That is not true. See section 5 in the review mentioned under
point 1). As I stated before, the research needs to be properly placed in the realm of the existing
13
literature, and attempts should not be made to distort the facts. And this goes for agent-based
modelling as much as it goes for gang spreading in a population, both of which have a much
richer history than the authors currently acknowledge.

Comments to the Author(s)
Authors have submitted a revised manuscript that is improved in many of the points I mentioned
earlier. Nevertheless, some issues remain that require further revision.
1) In the Introduction, the authors mis-cite reference 10. The correct reference is M. R. D'Orsogna
and M. Perc, Statistical physics of crime: A review, Phys. Life Rev. 12 (2015) 1-21. Currently it
seems the authors cite a comment to that review. That is fine too, but the original review should
be cited, and the comment then has other authors.
2) In terms of agent-based models and crime, the recent approach based on the inspection game,
as presented in Understanding recurrent crime as system-immanent collective behavior, PLoS
ONE 8 (2013) e76063, deserves mentioning.
3) In the conclusions, the authors state that the model is among the first attempts that we could
find to model the spread of gangs. That is not true. See section 5 in the review mentioned under
point 1). As I stated before, the research needs to be properly placed in the realm of the existing
literature, and attempts should not be made to distort the facts. And this goes for agent-based
modelling as much as it goes for gang spreading in a population, both of which have a much
richer history than the authors currently acknowledge.

REVIEWER 1
 1) The title is catchy, but maybe a bit too imprecise. There is little eco-epidemiological
about the considered model. Please note that predator-prey models have been used for all
sorts of different phenomena. It would be better to just refer to the model as a modified
predator-prey model, rather than an eco-epidemiological model.
2) Quite a bit more has been done on the subject of crime modeling as is currently
acknowledged in the first paragraph of the introduction. The authors have altogether
missed agent-based modeling, as used in Understanding recurrent crime as system-
immanent collective behavior, PLoS ONE 8, e76063 (2013) and Saving human lives:
What complexity science and information systems can contribute, D. Helbing, et al., J.
Stat. Phys. 158, 735-781 (2015), as well as the recent review on the subject Statistical
physics of crime: A review, M. R. D'Orsogna, M. Perc, Phys. Life Rev. 12, 1-21 (2015)
3) It would also improve the quality and clarity of the paper if the figure captions would
be made more self-contained. What is the main message of the figure could be stated in a
sentence or two.
4) I am worried about the clarity of some of the figures. The lines are very thin, and the
axis labeling is also rather imprecise in relation to the notation introduced in the main
part of the paper. This could be improved.
ponse:
1) New title: “A modified predator-prey model for the Interaction of Police and Gangs”
2) Actually street gang rivalries (Hegemann, Smith, Barbaro,Bertozzi, Reid, and Tita 2011)
and the propensity of a person to commit a criminal act (Nadal, Gordon,Iglesias, and
Semeshenko 2010) are agent based models.
ugh traditionally used in the statistical analysis of data, non-statistical mathematical models
d on economic models, agent based and predator prey or infectious disease models* have
been applied to a range of crime problems like the formation of crime hotspots (Short,
ntingham, Bertozzi, and Tita 2010), geographic profiling of offenders (O’Leary 2009), street
g rivalries (Hegemann, Smith, Barbaro, Bertozzi, Reid, and Tita 2011), the possible
rgent/system-immanent nature of crime (*********************) and the propensity of a
on to commit a criminal act (Nadal, Gordon,Iglesias, and Semeshenko 2010).
ncluded this in the paragraph

avior, PLoS ONE 8, e76063 (2013). (added)

4) We have adjusted the thickness of the curves in our plots and fixed the axis labels
accordingly.
REVIEWER 2
 Comments to the Author(s)
I have studied the manuscript: “Eco-epidemiological Model for the Interaction of Police
and Gangs” by Sooknanan, Bhatt and Comissiong. Here the authors present and
discuss a model for describing the interaction between police control and gangs. Despite
I believing the results are somehow interesting (due to my research interests), I’m not
convinced that this manuscript is suitable for the present journal.
The model has an exhaustive list of assumptions; some are intuitive, but others seem
not properly justified (such as ruling out the stochastic effects).
ponse:
terministic model can be used to describe and explain what happens on average at the population
e. It is assumed that the model is deterministic when the behavior of the model is determined
pletely by its history and by the rules which govern the development of the model (Brauer et al.
8, 25). A deterministic model is an acceptable approximation to the stochastic model when the
ulation size is sufficiently large (Castillo-Chavez et al. 2002).
 Also, there are too many technical details that I believe can be suppressed, providing
focus on the results. The absence of data and model validation lets the reader somehow
lost in the smog of model parameters.
ponse:
felt that the technical details were necessary for the reader to understand the model, especially
e the model represents a "new take" on modeling criminal behaviour. The term “experimental data”
is research work refers to crime data and crime statistics. However, reliable crime statistics were
only difficult to obtain, and when found, were usually in a form too summarised for a crime model.
limited crime statistics available in Trinidad and Tobago can be utilized to describe criminal acts that
e carried out, but little can be concluded about the criminals themselves. Our model attempts to
ribe the behaviour of criminals. There is limited access to data and detailed information about the
amics of gangs and the operational procedures of police in Trinidad and Tobago. It therefore has
en difficult to validate this (or any other) crime model. It should also be noted that our model was
not to predict future trends or behavior, but to provide insights into the dynamics of crime.
 The authors could try sending their results to a more specialized journal (perhaps a more
mathematical one), where the readers may find their results more interesting.
ponse:
ction criteria of the Royal Society Open Science Selection criteria include “Original research in
nce, engineering or mathematics and submissions should sufficiently advance scientific knowledge.”
ugh statistics and probability theory emerged from the need to quantify populations and economies
e nineteenth century, mathematics has not traditionally been used in the social sciences (Ball 2003).
hematical modeling of crime is a relatively new area and this model represents the first we could
using a predator-prey model where police are considered as hunters of criminals. This model may
sed to perform “virtual” experiments to evaluate the efficacy of crime prevention strategies or to
est improvements and can complement traditional approaches to research.
REVIEWER 3
 The problem is that the topic is very interesting, but in my opinion at times the paper is
written sloppily. The first thing that makes me upset is the mixing of biological and
sociological language. Once at the outset the authors identify criminals with diseased
people, it is enough to continue to talk about corrupted persons and not label them as
"infected", because that is just
misleading. The parallel between the fields is OK at the beginning, but should not be
mixed up all the time.
In this respect, see e.g. P. 5 l. 35: police are always "hungry"!
Another thing is that throughout the paper, most of the times by "police" the authors
mean policemen or police officers, not the "police body".
ponse: The necessary changes have been made.
 The thing that bothers me most however is the fact that in the formulation, it is said that
the number of policemen is constant, P, and that is a fundamental fact for the subsequent
analysis. But summing the equations (P. 3) for S_P amd I_P one gets
S_P' + I_P' = -g_1 and not equal to 0.
This is explained only much later after discussing the form for g_1, to say that
alpha_3=0, which is the same as taking g_1=0 in the first place. I think this is overdoing.
Either you keep P constant and
forget about police fighting corrupted policemen, or you consider
this and drop the assumption that S_P + I_P = constant.
ponse: We changed this.
 P. 3 l. 22: the parameters are assumed nonnegative, this has nothing to do with the
nonnegativity of the solutions of the model!
ponse: This should read “All these parameters are considered as non-negative since negative
meters have no real-life significance”. (This change has been made).
 Eqs (3.1)-(3.5) should be omitted, referring to them simply as "the equilibrium equations"
of the model.
ponse: We have omitted these equations and all the related references to them as well.
 Coexistence equilibrium. It is in fact NOT calculated, where is the value of Z? In
discussing it, > perhaps sufficient conditions for its existence could be attempted.
ponse:
ressions for Ip, Sg and Ig may be used to obtain the value of Z from this equation. Please
though that this was one of the equations - labelled (3.4) – that we were asked to omit from
revised version of the article.
 What is the need of (3.8)? Isn't the Jacobian sufficent for the stability?
ponse: We have removed this equation.
 Why there cannot be Hopf bifurcations for E_1? Explain better!
ce for
must be < 0. This is not possible.
he bifurcation analysis, one of the Figures should show all the populations.
ponse: As seen in fig 3, the relative magnitudes of the populations are not amenable to this.
 Minor points: fixed

Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Further revisions are necessary because the authors did not take any of the comments really seriously;
neither mine nor that of the other referees. I also do not care much for their single-sentence replies to
most of the comments that were communicated to them. Either do the revision well, or send your paper
elsewhere.
A comprehensive and complete introduction is of paramount importance for any paper. I do not care if 2
other papers on agent-based modelling have already been cited before. That is not the point. The point is
to provide the interdisciplinary readership of the journal with a proper introduction to the field, and since
this paper has to do with modeling of crime, the two mentioned recent reviews should be of interest
(despite the fact that 2 other papers already give some credit to agent-based models). The figure captions
are still not what one would have hoped for. In fact, not much has been added at all, and as a reader I am
still struggling with the meaning of displayed curves. The same for the table captions.
<U+F0D8> We have revised the introduction significantly to make it more appropriate for a general audience.
We have included a detailed description of agent-based modelling, citing some of the most
significant papers that have been published. We then proceeded to describe the models that we
adapted from Population Biology (infectious disease and predator-prey models) to study crime. The
introduction now includes a complete review of the different types of models that have been used
for studying crime, and contains twenty citations. The last paragraph contains a brief description of
the general layout of our paper.
<U+F0D8> We have also revised the figure and table captions, and completely restructured Table 4 – in order
to make it clear when (for what parameter ranges) there is change in stability that forces a switch
from one equilibrium state to another (i.e. at bifurcation points).
<U+F0D8> We removed the original Figure 1 (the model diagram) from this revised version of the article to
improve readability (especially for the more general audience). The model equations describing the
relations between the state variables on page 4 are in fact sufficient to describe the system. We
also removed one of the unnecessary variables “g” from the Functional Response section, since this
variable is zero.
<U+F0D8> In the Discussion of Results section (at the beginning of part (a)), we have included a paragraph
outlining the significance/importance of bifurcation points.

Comments to the Author(s)
I have studied the amended version of the manuscript "Eco-epidemiological Model for the Interaction
of Police and Gangs", which is now titled "A Modified Predator-Prey Model for the Interaction of
Police and Gangs". I find that this version was considerably improved, especially due the comments of
the Rev. #2 and the academic editor.
As before, this new version is performed at a high enough technical standard. Also, the subject is
worth to be investigated, interesting (in my opinion) and, as stated by the authors, it may represent a
"new take" on modeling criminal behavior. A fact that I had missed in my first report. I still find that
there are too many technical details in the text and that it will reduce the visibility of the manuscript
for a broader audience; however, it seems that the authors consider that this level of detail is
necessary. I'm not totally sure, but perhaps moving part of the "calculations" to an appendix will
make the paper more fluid. For instance, when reading most of section 3, I already got the impression
of reading an appendix.
Having said that and also taking into account the academic editor comments, I recommend the
publication of this new version.
<U+F0D8> We have tried our best to create appendices for Section 3 to make the paper more readable.
o Appendix A contains details about the calculated equilibrium states E2 and E3.
o Appendix B contains additional information about the equilibrium state E4.
o Appendix C contains the coefficients of the polynomial that is to be solved to find the
eigenvalues for the stability analysis.

his paper is an example of overdoing. Mathematical modeling should be a discipline in which some relevant
eatures of the situation at hand are considered, while some others are discarded.
n the present case, the authors introduce the judiciary system, the variable Z in the differential system, but
he latter acts just as a sink in the system. There is no feedback whatsoever of Z in the first 4 equations.
t this point, its role is irrelevant for the system dynamics. If the authors wish to keep it in the formulation, I
uggest that after writing the system they remark what I just said and keep on working without Z. If they want

quations, but this would probably considerably alter the model and make necessary a new analysis. Other

ersonally I find a bit confusing the wording in epidemiological terms for these social issues.
erhaps rewriting the equilibria interpretation as e.g. gang-free or corrupted officers-free points would make
he paper more understandable.
inally, there is a lot of research on ecoepidemic model, past the ones indicated in the literature.

<U+F0D8> As suggested by the referee, to preserve the analysis of the system dynamics, we have included the
necessary statement about variable Z in the Assumption section (Assumption 4).
<U+F0D8> We have edited the description of the equilibrium states (E2 and E3). We have changed “core-free
equilibrium” to “core gang-free equilibrium” and “infected equilibrium” to “core gang-free and
corrupted police-free equilibrium”.
<U+F0D8> We have removed any unnecessary repetition of the words “predator” and “prey”, and replaced
the word “compartment” with “population” when possible.
<U+F0D8> We have incorporated six papers that deal with eco-epidemiological models in the Discussion
section, including a recent (2016) review article by E. Venturino.

uthors have submitted a revised manuscript that is improved in many of the points I
mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, some issues remain that require further revision.
) In the Introduction, the authors mis-cite reference 10. The correct reference is M. R.
'Orsogna and M. Perc, Statistical physics of crime: A review, Phys. Life Rev. 12 (2015) 1-
1. Currently it seems the authors cite a comment to that review. That is fine too, but the
riginal review should be cited, and the comment then has other authors.
esponse: We corrected the citation (which now reads as reference number 11) in the
ntroduction section. As the referee correctly pointed out, this was a comment on the
aper by D’Orsogna and Perc. For completion, we have also incorporated the original
eview paper by D’Orsogna and Perc as reference number 12.
) In terms of agent-based models and crime, the recent approach based on the inspection
ame, as presented in Understanding recurrent crime as system-immanent collective
ehavior, PLoS ONE 8 (2013) e76063, deserves mentioning.
esponse: We have included this important paper as reference number 7 in the
ntroduction section.
) In the conclusions, the authors state that the model is among the first attempts that we
ould find to model the spread of gangs. That is not true. See section 5 in the review
mentioned under point 1). As I stated before, the research needs to be properly placed in
he realm of the existing literature, and attempts should not be made to distort the facts.
nd this goes for agent-based modelling as much as it goes for gang spreading in a
opulation, both of which have a much richer history than the authors currently
cknowledge.
esponse: We have removed this sentence from the Conclusion, as it does not in any way
etract from the main ideas presented in this section.
