This is a very nice review of Gamma-ray bursts and their use as cosmic probes. It fulfils its brief
well, and is well written overall. I personally found it quite educational to read. However, there
are a few areas which could do with attention. The changes I will suggest are almost all very
minor, but I think that they are important to clarify or correct the factual basis of the work, to
improve citations to previous work, or to make the review more readable.
Abstract: purely a stylistic point, but the word 'immense' is used twice in the same sentence (and
then again in the first sentence of the introduction). It seems rather unimaginative, and gives a
negative impression as one first starts to read the paper.
Introduction:
First paragraph. 'tenths of tens of seconds': I'm sure that the author didn't really mean to write
this.
In the first and second paragraphs, papers should be cited for the discovery that GRBs are
isotropic, the discovery of X-ray and optical counterparts of GRB970508 and for the
determination of its redshift.
Third paragraph. A pedantic point, but I think that 'withstanding' is usually used with an object,
since it really means standing against. Therefore I think that 'long-standing' would be more
appropriate than 'long-withstanding'.

Section 2 (a). I am a bit concerned about the discussion about ultra-long GRBs. If ultra-long GRBs
are those with durations of thousands to tens of thousands of seconds, as the author states, then I
am surprised that GRB101225a was the first to be discovered and I am surprised to hear that
there are only four clear examples. The description 'thousands to tens of thousands' falls short of
being a definition, so it isn't clear to the reader what definition the author is using for 'ultra-long',
and I don't think the term 'clear examples' is very meaningful for something that hasn't been
defined. From a quick look at Virgili et al. 2013 (reference number 24 in the review), I see that
they use a threshold of 1000s duration to define ultra-long GRBs, and list a sample of 12, only
two of which occurred after GRB101225a. If the author does have a definition for ultra-long in
mind, then it does not appear to be the same as that used by Virgili et al. at least. Some clarity is
needed in this section: if there are multiple conflicting definitions in use in the literature, the
reader should be made aware of them as he or she reads this part of the review, and the author
must indicate what definition is being applied to come up with a sample of only four, otherwise
this review is likely to mislead and/or confuse its readers.
Section 2 (b). A pedantic point. in the fourth paragraph it is said that the 'number' of detected
achromatic breaks 'are relatively rare'. Either the number is small, or the breaks are rare, but not
the number are rare.
Section 2 (c). Last paragraph. The word 'have' is missing from 'in order for the magnetar model to
sufficient luminosity'
Section 2 (d) (i). Second paragraph. I think 'the circumburst' should be 'the circumburst medium'.
Section 2 (e). First paragraph. I don't agree with the statement 'As such information on the
progenitors of short GRBs remains mostly speculative.' I think 'speculative' should be instead
'indirect'. Indeed the very sentence that follows this one provides several examples of information
relating to the progenitors that are not speculative at all, but certainly indirect.
Figure 2. The time units are missing from the caption in '9 after the GRB'.
Section 2 (e). Fourth paragraph. One or more papers which give the range out to which LIGO can
detect compact binary (neutron star) mergers should be cited.
Sectin 3. First paragraph. GRB090429B had a redshift of 9.4, so is not within the range 8-9 given
here; it should be 8-10. Note in the same sentence, 'or' should be 'of' in 'epoch or reionisation'.
Note also that here 'ionisation' is spelled with an 's' here, but later on (e.g. in Section 3 (b)) with a
'z'; consistent spelling would be better.
Third paragraph. I don't understand the word 'also' in 'At higher metallicities, line-driven stellar
winds also remove significant angular momentum.' As well as what?
Section 3 (a). First paragraph. It is stated that 25% of long GRB afterglows are enshrouded by
more than 1 magnitude of extinguishing dust. Without specifying which band this refers to, this
is a meaningless statistic. The fraction will certainly be much larger if this is referring to the UV
than it will if this is referring to the K band; it should also be specified if the relevant band is in
the rest-frame of the GRB or the observers frame.
Section 3 (b). Fourth paragraph. It is not obvious to me why a dampled Lyman alpha line with
log N(HI)>20.3 implies that ionization corrections are negligible. I would have thought that if
there were a large column of hydrogen, say long N(H)=22, and 90% were ionized, then I would
see a dampled Ly alpha line indicating log N(HI)=21. But the correction would be a factor of 10,
certainly not negligible. This is much more the author's specialist subject than mine, and my
thinking may well be flawed, but (assuming that is the case) I would like to understand why. I
think some explanation as to why large column density implies negligible ionization correction
would be entirely appropriate here, as would a citation to work in which the issue is examined in
4
more detail. I'm also surprised to hear that a negligible fraction of neutral hydrogen is in
molecular form (especially given that GRBs occur in star-forming galaxies), so some explanation
and a reference or two would do no harm here either.
Section 3 (c). This is the one part of the review that needs some serious attention. The emphasis
seems wrong in this section. It comes across that this is recent work close to the author's heart,
and that the author is rather wrapped up in it. I empathise, but it would fit much better if it could
be focused on the aspects of this study that are directly relevant to the subject of the review.
Firstly, it reads as an advert for MUSE, with hype about 'revolutionised the spatial scales on
which galaxies can be studied'. I think that is rather off-topic in this review. I also think that the
comparison with VIMOS spatial resolution is out of place. Is there any substance to the statement
about 'what we will hopefully be able to achieve with future instrumentation on a much larger
sample of GRB host galaxies'? What instrument is going to give 160pc resolution IFU
spectroscopy across the rest-frame optical of a large sample of GRB host galaxies? Can JWST
NIRspec do that? Unless there are real prospects of doing this, I think this is rather distracting
from the substance of this section, which is what is learned from a state of the art IFU observation
of the closest GRB host galaxy. What would be useful to know are the spectral resolution and the
wavelength range of the MUSE data that are being described, but these are not given. The
information about how different the dust attenuation is between MUSE and VIMOS is also off-
topic. I'm presuming that the difference is related to the spectral resolution and/or wavelength
range of MUSE relative to VIMOS but since neither is given for MUSE or VIMOS, I don't think
that the reader learns anything very useful from the comparison. And I'd be amazed if the
difference in derived extinction is really 2 dex in magnitude, i.e. 100 magnitudes of extinction
difference (!?). The tone still seems wrong into the 4th paragraph, which continues to compare the
MUSE results to those from previous observations of the same GRB. Surely the important things
the reader wants to learn from this case study are about the properties of the host galaxy and
immediate surroundings of GRB980425, not the supremacy of the authors' MUSE observations
compared to other works. In the comparison of the metallicity indicators, the author talks about
'metallicity diagnostics when the [O II] lines are not available'. As the wavelength range of the
observations has not been given (and I suspect like many readers, I am not familiar offhand with
the wavelength range of MUSE) I am wondering firstly if the [O II] lines are available or not in
this case, and secondly whether the metallicity would be more reliable if the [O II] lines were
available, given the discussion of the problems with the most-used non-[O II] diagnostics. It
would help to clarify those points. Now, to the final paragraph. I have no idea how to locate the
H II region 'just north' of the GRB position. How far north are we talking - 50pc, 200pc, 1kpc? To
make matters worse, despite the emphasis on the importance of spatial resolution in terms of
parsecs in the text, there is no indication on Figure 5 of the spatial scale that applies to these
images. It would considerably improve the reader's understanding if the author could add a line
to Figure 5 to show how large 1 kpc would be on these images.
Section 4. At the end of the first paragraph. The phrase 'as is the case with QSO lines of sight.' is
ambiguous; it is true that QSO sight lines are also free from the glare of GRBs, but I can not
understand why the author would want to state this.
In the third paragraph, it is stated that the high XRT detection rate is instrumental in providing
rapid arcsecond positions for further follow up observations. In the context here (spectroscopy of
afterglows to measure absorption features) I think that this is altogether a red-herring. Optical
spectroscopic follow up, particularly at high spectral resolution, is almost exclusively directed at
bright optical afterglows. Except for high redshift events, these are identified in the initial Swift
GCN circular through their detection with UVOT, and the UVOT position is sub-arcsecond. It
would be perverse to use the XRT positions for optical follow up of these afterglows. A much
more relevant point to make here would be that the high detection rate with XRT means that
complementary data in the X-ray is (almost) always available, for examination of absorption in
the X-ray domain and to constrain the underlying SED shape.
5
Section 4 (b). First paragraph and figure 7. I apologise for being a pedant here, but I believe that
'gray' is the American, rather than the English spelling of 'grey'. For a Royal Society publication, I
think the spelling should be English.
Section 4 (b) Fourth paragraph. It is stated here that *numerous* GRB sightlines have been found
with Milky Way or LMC-like dust (i.e. with the 2175A feature) since GRB070802. The very first
sentence of the fifth paragraph refers to the *handful* of cases where a 2175A dust feature has
been detected. I think that these are altogether contradictory: there can not be both very many
and very few examples. The two paragraphs should be brought into line with each other; perhaps
a more quantitative description than 'numerous' or 'handful' would be appropriate to clarify the
issue.
Section 4 (c) Third paragraph. Just a typo: 'dust dust depletion'.
Section 5. First sentence. I think this sentence may alienate many old hands in GRB research, and
I think it is very hard to justify. When Swift was launched, GRB research had been going on for
more than 30 years, BATSE had observed thousands of GRBs, the extragalactic nature of GRBs
had been establised, and the afterglows discovered at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths. The
term 'infancy' simply isn't appropriate to describe a > 30 year old scientific area that has
undergone such a large amount of progress. Please come up with a description that is more
appropriate.
Later in the same paragraph, the coverage of SVOM is described as going to 'far redder'
wavelengths than Swift (400-950 nm). Given that UVOT on Swift goes as far as 800nm in the
White filter, I would agree that SVOM is redder, but not 'far' redder.
Second paragraph. It is claimed that JWST and E-ELT may provide high signal to noise mid or
high resolution afterglow spectra of every GRB with an accurate afterglow position. Can this
really be true, given that there are a substantial number of GRBs for which we currently detect no
afterglow at all down to quite deep limits, not to mention the pointing and slewing constraints
that JWST will have and the fact that only a portion of the sky is visible to E-ELT or any other
individual ground-based telescope? At least to me, it sounds like an exaggeration. If this section
is to be useful to readers it should be measured and realistic, and hyperbole avoided.
Third paragraph. The lesson learned from the advent of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of
AGN using Chandra and XMM-Newton is that absorption lines are much more important than
absorption edges in diagnosing the ionisation state of absorbing material. Yet the opening
sentence refers only to absorption edges; it should be revised accordingly.

detect compact binary (neutron star) mergers should be cited.
Sectin 3. First paragraph. GRB090429B had a redshift of 9.4, so is not within the range 8-9 given

observations has not been given (and I suspect like many readers, I am not familiar offhand with
the wavelength range of MUSE) I am wondering firstly if the [O II] lines are available or not in
10
this case, and secondly whether the metallicity would be more reliable if the [O II] lines were
available, given the discussion of the problems with the most-used non-[O II] diagnostics. It
would help to clarify those points. Now, to the final paragraph. I have no idea how to locate the
H II region 'just north' of the GRB position. How far north are we talking - 50pc, 200pc, 1kpc? To
make matters worse, despite the emphasis on the importance of spatial resolution in terms of
parsecs in the text, there is no indication on Figure 5 of the spatial scale that applies to these
images. It would considerably improve the reader's understanding if the author could add a line
to Figure 5 to show how large 1 kpc would be on these images.
Section 4. At the end of the first paragraph. The phrase 'as is the case with QSO lines of sight.' is
ambiguous; it is true that QSO sight lines are also free from the glare of GRBs, but I can not
understand why the author would want to state this.
In the third paragraph, it is stated that the high XRT detection rate is instrumental in providing
rapid arcsecond positions for further follow up observations. In the context here (spectroscopy of

spectroscopic follow up, particularly at high spectral resolution, is almost exclusively directed at
bright optical afterglows. Except for high redshift events, these are identified in the initial Swift

would be perverse to use the XRT positions for optical follow up of these afterglows. A much
more relevant point to make here would be that the high detection rate with XRT means that
complementary data in the X-ray is (almost) always available, for examination of absorption in
the X-ray domain and to constrain the underlying SED shape.
Section 4 (b). First paragraph and figure 7. I apologise for being a pedant here, but I believe that
'gray' is the American, rather than the English spelling of 'grey'. For a Royal Society publication, I
think the spelling should be English.
Section 4 (b) Fourth paragraph. It is stated here that *numerous* GRB sightlines have been found
with Milky Way or LMC-like dust (i.e. with the 2175A feature) since GRB070802. The very first
sentence of the fifth paragraph refers to the *handful* of cases where a 2175A dust feature has
been detected. I think that these are altogether contradictory: there can not be both very many
and very few examples. The two paragraphs should be brought into line with each other; perhaps
a more quantitative description than 'numerous' or 'handful' would be appropriate to clarify the
issue.
Section 4 (c) Third paragraph. Just a typo: 'dust dust depletion'.
Section 5. First sentence. I think this sentence may alienate many old hands in GRB research, and
I think it is very hard to justify. When Swift was launched, GRB research had been going on for
more than 30 years, BATSE had observed thousands of GRBs, the extragalactic nature of GRBs
had been establised, and the afterglows discovered at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths. The
term 'infancy' simply isn't appropriate to describe a > 30 year old scientific area that has
undergone such a large amount of progress. Please come up with a description that is more
appropriate.
Later in the same paragraph, the coverage of SVOM is described as going to 'far redder'
wavelengths than Swift (400-950 nm). Given that UVOT on Swift goes as far as 800nm in the
White filter, I would agree that SVOM is redder, but not 'far' redder.
Second paragraph. It is claimed that JWST and E-ELT may provide high signal to noise mid or
high resolution afterglow spectra of every GRB with an accurate afterglow position. Can this
really be true, given that there are a substantial number of GRBs for which we currently detect no
afterglow at all down to quite deep limits, not to mention the pointing and slewing constraints
that JWST will have and the fact that only a portion of the sky is visible to E-ELT or any other
11
individual ground-based telescope? At least to me, it sounds like an exaggeration. If this section
is to be useful to readers it should be measured and realistic, and hyperbole avoided.
Third paragraph. The lesson learned from the advent of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of
AGN using Chandra and XMM-Newton is that absorption lines are much more important than
absorption edges in diagnosing the ionisation state of absorbing material. Yet the opening
sentence refers only to absorption edges; it should be revised accordingly.

rall I found this to be a thorough and well-written review. My comments
ge
m minor (typos etc.) to moderately important requests.
Intro - I think it is an exageration to say "several solar masses" in this
text. The "cosmological" origin of GRBs might have meant redshifts of
ew tenths, in which case energy requirements would not be quite so high.
y a handful of the very most luminous GRBs require isotropic energies
ivalent
a solar mass or more rest-energy.
next line - I presume the "few tenths of" should be "few tenths to"
same para - I would suggest adding a reference to support the isotropic
distribution e.g. Briggs+1996.
next para - from a historical point of view, it would seem sensible to
tion
228 as being the first case of an optical afterglow identification
sta+1997,
Paradijs+97). Although the redshift was not obtained at the time, the
t
axy was observed.
thermore, one should also cite Metzger+1997 for the 970508 redshift.
intro para 3 - "days to seconds" again seems somewhat exagerated.
ically
ays were "hours" in the BeppoSAX era (and are "minutes" with Swift).
same para - "long-withstanding" ? "long-standing" ?
next para - typo "structured as following"
footnote 3 - minor point, capitalise "sun"
section 2d(i) - "almost a decade" should be "almost two decades" (although
might argue that some essential features of the model pre-dated the cited
i et al. paper, so one could just say "around two decades".
same para - "single reverse-forward shock" would be better expressed as
ngle reverse and forward shock emission components" (since reverse and
ward
distinct).
same para - "unequivocal agreement" may be an overstatement. The
erenced
elli et al. paper preferred a constant density medium. Perhaps the Perley
al.
er was intended to be cited here? In any case, should tone down.
section 2e - on mentioning the first afterglow spectrum of a short-burst,
uld
e the relevant paper (de Ugarte-Postigo et al.).
same para - there have also been several papers looking at population
racteristics
short bursts, some of which might be cited in support of some of these
nts
. Zhang et al., Fong et al., Tunnicliffe et al., Berger et al. I don't
nk it
necessary to be exhaustive, but good to provide some entries into the
erature.
general - "kilonova" -> "kilonovae" where it is plural.
section 3 para 1 - another high redshift z~8 burst is reported in
iv:1703.09052
section 3 para 2 - I agree there are uncertainties in mapping SFR history
m
s, but it is fair to say that there are also uncertainties in mapping SFR
tory
m galaxy observations too. e.g. extrapolating the observed luminosity
ction,
recting for dust etc.
section 3a para 1 - "inline" ? "in line" ?
same para - the KAIT is cited as having an infrared camera, but in fact it
CD camera, so is not infrared in the sense normally used.
section 3c - when mentioning "complete" samples, one might also cite the
GH sample and BAT6 samples.
any case, in this para, since it is stated that these samples are small, it
ld be good to give an indication of the size, using SHOALS as an example.
same sect para 4 - "O/H" here, looks like "0/H" i.e. zero rather than "O"
same sect para 5 - "are the ability" -> "is the ability"
t line - plural "GRB" in "GRB and massive stars"
sect 4 para 2 - again, one could cite some examples here for detailed
ctroscopic studies. Admittedly some are cited in the subsequent sections,
may not be essential.
sect 4d - "expected to be ubiquitous" would be better as "expected to be
mon",
ce e.g. very low column, or high redshift (due to Gunn-Peterson trough)
ld
be feasible to detect molecular absorption.

Author's response to Reviewer 1:
I wish to thank the reviewer for their very careful comments, and for picking up in places
where my citations and historical knowledge were lacking.
All comments from Reviewer #1 have been addressed in full, and these are highlighted in
bold in the pdf file.
Author's response to Reviewer 2:
I wish to thank the reviewer for their careful comments, and for pointing out places in
the review where more detail was preferable.
All comments from Reviewer #2 have been addressed in full, and these are
highlighted in bold in the pdf file.
In particular, the discussion in section 2(a) on ultra-long GRBs has now been
extended to provide a better description of the term 'ultra-long GRBs', and a more
rounded summary on the current views expressed in the literature on the origin of this
class of GRB.
The fourth paragraph in section 3(b) now includes a more detailed description of the
term 'DLA' and the reasons why ionization corrections in such systems are negligible.
Section 3(c) has been extensively modified to now provide a case study on two (rather
than one) nearby GRB host galaxies for which high spatial resolution spectral data
with MUSE provide detailed information on the immediate environments of these two
GRBs. This section now focus only on the analysis and environmental conditions that
are relevant to our understanding of GRB progenitors. Fig. 5 has also been replaced to
now show the conditions in the vicinity of the two GRBs, rather than the previous
figure, which had a greater emphasis on galaxy emission line diagnostics.
