The paper Mixing and Diffusion in a two-type population by Izquierdo, Izquierdo and Lopez-
Pintado is, in my opinion, a nice example of how to apply mathematics. They post a precise
question: is mixing susceptible and resistant individuals a good strategy to contain the outbreak
of a contagious disease? or is it better to minimize the interaction between this two groups? To
attack this question they construct an ODE based model and study its properties. It is surprising
that the answer to this question depend on the propensity of the resistant and the susceptible
groups to become infected, and in some regimen, mixing the groups can be beneficial for the
resistant group.
The applicability of this method to other phenomena is clear from the example of infectious
disease. However, the other examples discussed by the authors seem to fit in this framework in a
less natural way: does the motivation of kids at schools is governed by the interaction among
kids? This seems to me to be a second order cause of motivation, however I am of not an expert in
this. It could be risky to make recommendation on educational or economic policies based on
such a simplified model, for that reason I would suggest to not overemphasis applications in
directions other than epidemiology.
Overall, the paper is well written and interesting and my opinion (as an outsider of the field) is
that it can be consider for publication after some minor changes.

Review: Mixing and di<U+21B5>usion in a two-type
population
The authors analyse an SIS model of epidemic spread. The situation they
consider is one in which the population is comprised of two types of individual
(in addition to the Susceptible and Infected classes); one is more resistant to
infection and the other more sensitive. Mixing between these two subclasses
occurs at a rate m where m = 0 corresponds to total segregation of the sub-
populations (entirely homophillic interactions), m = 0.5 corresponds to unbi-
ased mixing between the populations and m = 1 corresponds to a bipartite
population (segregative interactions).
The fixed points of the system are characterised and their stability analysed.
It is found that while the level of infection in the stationary state within the
sensitive group is a strictly decreasing function of the mixing rate, increasing
the mixing rate can have a non-mononic a<U+21B5>ect on the infection level in the resis-
tant group. Depending on the parameters increasing m from 0 can lead to the
infection level in the resistant group first increasing and then decreasing with
m. The parameter range within which this occurs is determined analytically.
The robustness of the analytical results to additional stochasticity (arising from
demographic fluctuations and population heterogeneity) is explored. A general-
ization of the model is presented, which shares qualitatively similar behaviour.
The ideas explored in this paper are relatively interesting and presented in an
intuitive way. The mathematical analysis is straightforward and entirely capable
of explaining the system’s behaviour to the level the authors are interested in.
The key concepts are explained well overall, especially in relation to the authors’
figures.
The essence of the paper is, to me, appropriate for the Royal Society Open
Science. However there are a number of changes to the manuscript that I think
would improve the paper for publication:
1. The referencing is overly terse. I believe that the introduction would
benefit greatly from a clearer description of the state of the field, includ-
ing references to some foundation texts. Terms such as “Pareto-inefficient
mixing” are not referenced but should be. The relation between the gener-
alised model and existing models in the literature is not addressed, however
this would be helpful. Further I believe that the conclusion or discussion
would benefit from an attempt to place their results in the context of the
existing literature. Overall the paper contains only 20 references. Though
this is normally sufficient, more may be required in this case given that the
subject matter of the paper jumps between epidemiology and sociology.
2. The text often moves between discussing the results of the model under
di<U+21B5>erent interpretations (e.g. as an SIS model, as a model of student mo-
1
tivation in classrooms etc.). Within the main body of the paper (models,
results), I would suggest picking a single interpretation and sticking to
it. The other interpretations, as well as their significance, can then be de-
scribed in the introduction and discussion/conclusion. Here more attempt
could also be made to explain how these models are similar and what the
overarching principles are.
3. The structure of the paper could be improved. Following the introduc-
tion we have sections “An illustration of the main result”, “Two type SIS
model”, “Formal Results”, “Discussion” “Robustness”, “General Conta-
gion model” and “Conclusion”, which seems convoluted. It leads to a lot
of repetition and I believe much could be gained by merging sections and
streamlining the presentation of ideas. The robustness section could be
placed in appendix and referred to in-text with a couple of sentences as
it doesn’t add much to the main result. Discussion and conclusion sec-
tions could be merged or at least placed in succession. The Discussion
could also be extended (see also, point 1 – references to place results in
context). The specifics are ultimately up to the authors, however I would
think carefully about how to reorganise the paper to make it more clear.
There are also some minor points the authors may wish to address.
1. The term “di<U+21B5>usion level” is frequently used to talk about the stable
stationary state. It would be useful to define this.
2. In equations involving <U+21E2><U+02D9> the subscript i appears to be replaced with <U+25C6>.
3. The origin of the terms in Eqn. (1) and its generalisation could be dis-
cussed more fully.
4. Do the authors have any sense as to if the behaviour described in the paper
would be seen in a more general networks context, where a modularity
measure would replace the mixing term?

Mixing and diffusion in a two-type population
Reviewers’ comments
Reviewer 1
We thank reviewer 1 for his/her time reviewing the paper, as well as for his/her useful
comments.
The paper Mixing and Diffusion in a two-type population by Izquierdo, Izquierdo and
Lopez-Pintado is, in my opinion, a nice example of how to apply mathematics. They post
a precise question: is mixing susceptible and resistant individuals a good strategy to
contain the outbreak of a contagious disease? or is it better to minimize the interaction
between this two groups? To attack this question they construct an ODE based model
and study its properties. It is surprising that the answer to this question depend on the
propensity of the resistant and the susceptible groups to become infected, and in some
regimen, mixing the groups can be beneficial for the resistant group.
The applicability of this method to other phenomena is clear from the example of
infectious disease. However, the other examples discussed by the authors seem to fit in
this framework in a less natural way: does the motivation of kids at schools is governed
by the interaction among kids? This seems to me to be a second order cause of
motivation, however I am of not an expert in this. It could be risky to make
recommendation on educational or economic policies based on such a simplified model,
for that reason I would suggest to not overemphasis applications in directions other than
epidemiology.
Overall, the paper is well written and interesting and my opinion (as an outsider of the
field) is that it can be consider for publication after some minor changes.
Thank you for your suggestions. We agree with your notes, and we have focused more
on the epidemiology interpretation and have included some cautionary notes with
relation to the non-epidemiological interpretations. See footnote 4:
“Naturally, we do not claim that our simple model can be directly applied to any such situations
and used to automatically derive policy recommendations in settings where other factors not
included in the model may play an important role. Our model has been purposefully designed to
illustrate a phenomenon that can occur in a variety of contexts and, precisely for this reason, it is
highly stylized.”
-I see a parallelism between the fact that it is a good strategy for the resistant individuals
to ¨help¨ (mix with) the susceptible group and the emergence of altruistic behavior that
had been studied in evolutionary game theory.
Yes, for a resistant individual, and given some positive mixing level, coordinating with the
other resistant individuals to increase the mixing level can be good, even though more
mixing with susceptible individuals is individually costly if the other resistant individuals
do not follow suit. In this sense, in a strategic setting, increasing the mixing level would
constitute a social dilemma.
However, in our case, if <U+0001D706><U+0001D706>1 < 1 the resistant individuals would eradicate the disease in
their group for m = 0, while if <U+0001D706><U+0001D706>1 > 1 their infection level is increasing with m (proposition
3). Consequently, the resistant group could never be better off than at the zero-mixing
level. Though the effect of more mixing can be an improvement over some status-quo,
and complete mixing can even lead to eradicate the disease in both groups if <U+0001D706><U+0001D706>1 < <U+0001D706><U+0001D706>-1 2 <
1, in that case the resistant group would also eradicate the disease in its own group for
m = 0.
Thank you for the observation, we have included a related note in the text (footnote 7).
-p2 l17 it is not clear what is the contagious trait of students with high academic ability
Thank you for your observation. We have clarified that the considered contagious states
are “motivated” and “non-motivated”, instead of “high-ability” and “low-ability” as was
indicated before.
-p2 l21 the main result is a mathematical one, so I would change main result for method
We have modified that part of the text.
-p2l29 I can´t tell if the bibliographic review is appropriate as I am new to this field
-p3 l28 Do I understand correctly that resistant individuals increase there ¨fitness¨ by
minimizing the contact with infected susceptible individuals, and this can be archived in
some cases by having less contact with susceptible individuals (lowering the mixing rate)
and in some cases by ¨helping¨ the susceptible group and thus decreasing the number of
infected susceptible individuals?
(Please see the reply to the first comment)
-p3 eq 1 There seems to be a dot missing in the i after the first rho, this typo propagates
to equation 2 in page 4
Corrected, thank you.
p3 l60 by definition it is bad to have an infection, what about contagious instead of
infectious? contagious can be good.
The lack of an equivalent word for “infected” made some substitutions awkward. We
decided to keep this licence on the use of the word, considering that it is frequently used
beyond the scope of diseases, and that even in that context it could sometimes be
considered desirable (as when some relatively benign disease confers protection against
another).
Proposition 5 seems to be trivial compared with the previous propositions. What about
turning it into a remark?
In this case we found it less natural to state it as a remark, as it cannot be derived directly
from the previous results, and needs its own proof.
p7 l47 the notation 0,1 for the states and 1,2 for the groups is a bit painful, change one
of the two for letters.
Changed, thank you.
p 8 l40 if the parameters are measurable remove the potential if they are not always
measurable remove the and potentially measurable.
Changed, thank you.
Reviewer 2
We thank reviewer 2 for his/her time reviewing the paper, as well as for his/her useful
comments.
The authors analyse an SIS model of epidemic spread. The situation they
consider is one in which the population is comprised of two types of individual
(in addition to the Susceptible and Infected classes); one is more resistant to
infection and the other more sensitive. Mixing between these two subclasses
occurs at a rate m where m = 0 corresponds to total segregation of the subpopulations
(entirely homophillic interactions), m = 0.5 corresponds to unbiased
mixing between the populations and m = 1 corresponds to a bipartite
population (segregative interactions).
The fixed points of the system are characterised and their stability analysed.
It is found that while the level of infection in the stationary state within the
sensitive group is a strictly decreasing function of the mixing rate, increasing
the mixing rate can have a non-monotonic effect on the infection level in the resistant
group. Depending on the parameters increasing m from 0 can lead to the
infection level in the resistant group first increasing and then decreasing with
m. The parameter range within which this occurs is determined analytically.

1. The referencing is overly terse. I believe that the introduction would
benefit greatly from a clearer description of the state of the field, including
references to some foundation texts. Terms such as “Pareto-inefficient
mixing” are not referenced but should be. The relation between the generalised
model and existing models in the literature is not addressed, however
this would be helpful. Further I believe that the conclusion or discussion
would benefit from an attempt to place their results in the context of the
existing literature. Overall the paper contains only 20 references. Though
this is normally sufficient, more may be required in this case given that the
subject matter of the paper jumps between epidemiology and sociology.
Thank you for your suggestions. We have modified the discussion of related papers, trying
to clarify how our paper relates to previous ones. We have also included several new
references, mainly on epidemiology models applied to social contagion processes, as well
as on some related generalised models.
2. The text often moves between discussing the results of the model under
different interpretations (e.g. as an SIS model, as a model of student motivation in
classrooms etc.). Within the main body of the paper (models,
results), I would suggest picking a single interpretation and sticking to
it. The other interpretations, as well as their significance, can then be described
in the introduction and discussion/conclusion. Here more attempt
could also be made to explain how these models are similar and what the overarching
principles are.
Thank you for your suggestions. We have adapted the text to stick primarily to the
epidemiology interpretation on the main body of the paper, discussing other
interpretations in the introduction, in the discussion, and in the justification of the
general contagion model. Some more detail has also been added to justify the relation
between epidemiology and contagion models, as well as to justify the convenience of the
generalised model, referencing also some additional related papers.
3. The structure of the paper could be improved. Following the introduction
we have sections “An illustration of the main result”, “Two type SIS
model”, “Formal Results”, “Discussion” “Robustness”, “General Contagion
model” and “Conclusion”, which seems convoluted. It leads to a lot
of repetition and I believe much could be gained by merging sections and
streamlining the presentation of ideas. The robustness section could be
placed in appendix and referred to in-text with a couple of sentences as
it doesn’t add much to the main result. Discussion and conclusion sections

could also be extended (see also, point 1 – references to place results in
context). The specifics are ultimately up to the authors, however I would
think carefully about how to reorganise the paper to make it more clear.
We have reorganised and simplified the structure of the text following your suggestions.
After the summary, the sections are now “Introduction”, “Two-type SIS model”, “Formal
Results”, “General Contagion model” and “Discussion”. The robustness section is now in
the appendix, and referred to in the text. Discussion and conclusions have been merged,
and the relation to related papers has been rewritten and extended to make it clearer.
There are also some minor points the authors may wish to address.
1. The term “diffusion level” is frequently used to talk about the stable
stationary state. It would be useful to define this.
Done, thank you.
2. In equations involving <U+0001D70C><U+0001D70C><U+0307><U+0001D456><U+0001D456> the subscript i appears to be replaced
Corrected, thank you.
3. The origin of the terms in Eqn. (1) and its generalisation could be discussed
more fully.
An interpretation of the different terms of the equations has been added.
4. Do the authors have any sense as to if the behaviour described in the paper
would be seen in a more general networks context, where a modularity
measure would replace the mixing term?
In the two-group case there is a simple relationship between mixing (m) and modularity
(modularity = 0.5 – m). For more than two groups, the propensity values in each group
combined with the elements of the “mixing matrix” mij affect the behaviour of the
system. It can be shown that there are different mixing matrices corresponding to the
same modularity, but leading to different behaviour in our model. Modularity in those
cases would not be enough to characterise the behaviour of the system.
Thank you for your observation, we have included a note about modularity in the text
(footnote 5).
