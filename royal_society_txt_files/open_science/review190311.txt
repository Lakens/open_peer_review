The manuscript describes a study of the reaction mechanisms for the reaction of adsorbed ethanol
amine and carbon dioxide with the assistance of primary amines and secondary amines. The
authors explored different rate-determining steps in their proposed mechanism to elucidate
different potential overall rate laws. They compared the derived rate laws with experimental data
to determine possible rate-determining step in the proposed mechanism. It is refreshing to read a
fundamental study on understanding the chemical reactions. Overall, the manuscript needs
major re-writing. It is very difficult to follow the ideas in the manuscript because a lot of the math
symbols were either ill-defined or changed in the middle of the derivations. There are errors in
some of the math derivations. The criteria in the fittings of the experimental data is unexplained.
In summary, the reviewer does not recommend this manuscript for publication, but would
encourage the authors to resubmit the manuscript after major revision. Below are more detailed
comments:
1. It was unclear to the reviewer that ethanol amine was preadsorbed to the metal carbonates in
the manuscript writing. It was revealed by the graphics displaying the reaction schematic.
2. The authors proposed Eley-Rideal model to explain the reaction mechanism. While the
proposed idea is possible, the authors incorrectly stated that reference 25 claimed that their
reactions followed Eley-Rideal reactions. The reviewer read reference 25 and found that it
claimed Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism instead. The authors copied part of the figure in
reference 25 and discussed it in the supporting information. They should cite the materials
clearly.
3. The manuscript mentioned a lot of unusual terms. The reviewer does not understand the
meaning of these terms. For example, what is liquid [OH-]?
4. Many of the mathematics symbols were not defined in the main text. It is difficult to follow the
discussions. For example, on page 5, line 24, what are k (superscript: dot) (subscript: OH-) and r
(superscript: dot) (subscript: OH-)?
5. Why was BaCO3 chosen for the evaluation?
6. Page 7, line 45, what is figure 1a?
7. It is unclear to the reviewer why r3 is zero for B3 when B1 is the rate determining step.
According to the elementary step, B3 is a one direction elementary step reaction.
8. There are many typos in the manuscript. For example, “concertation” on page 9, line 16.
9. There is an error for equation (12). It should be [C] = CA0 times a = ½ CA0 (1- XA ). The
manuscript lacks clear derivations of the rate equations.
10. The manuscript lacks detailed experimental procedures for reproducing the materials.
11. The authors should justify why they chose R2 > 0.990 as the criteria for good fittings of the
data.
12. Why did the authors present no characterization data for BaCO3?
13. What are the error bars for the experimental data?
14. It is difficult to evaluate the rate law by fitting the F(Xa) vs time. It is better to directly extract
the order of reactions with respect to each reactants from the experimental data.

This manuscript proposed a new model for heterogeneous catalytic CO2-RR’NH interactions.
The reaction process, the elementary steps, and rate limiting steps was developed. These results
are useful for further studies with secondary amines etc. This manuscript is worth publication.
Several small problems need to be edited to improve the quality:
1. Introduction:
(1) It is mentioned mostly that the reaction of CO2 with primary amine and secondary amine, but
little of CO2 with tertiary amine. Please mention the reactions with tertiary amine to complete the
full map of kinetics.
2. Theory
(2) In Section 2.2 of reaction (B2), the author mentioned the activation energy (Ea) of carbamate

The authors answer most of the questions from reviewers. There are two minor but necessary
modifications needed:
1. In the described mechanisms, the arrows showed the direction of the molecule (such as CO2)
attacking the adsorbed amines. This counters the common convention that the arrows indicate
the flow direction of the electrons. Using this example, the lone pair electrons from the N of the
amine should attack the carbon of the CO2 to form the C-N bond. So under the usual convention,
the direction of the arrow should go from the amine to the carbon of the CO2. The authors should
use the typical convention instead.
2. There are many typos, random capitalization of words and missed subscripts in the
manuscript and the references. There are too many of them to be listed here. These to be

The manuscript describes a study of the reaction mechanisms for the reaction of
adsorbed ethanol amine and carbon dioxide with the assistance of primary amines
and secondary amines. The authors explored different rate-determining steps in
their proposed mechanism to elucidate different potential overall rate laws. They
compared the derived rate laws with experimental data to determine possible rate-
determining step in the proposed mechanism. It is refreshing to read a fundamental

Overall, the manuscript needs major re-writing. It is very difficult to follow
the ideas in the manuscript because a lot of the math symbols were either ill-
defined or changed in the middle of the derivations. There are errors in some of
the math derivations. The criteria in the fittings of the experimental data is
unexplained. In summary, the reviewer does not recommend this manuscript for
publication, but would encourage the authors to resubmit the manuscript after major
revision.
Response:
The reviewer has raised many useful points, and we are very grateful for his encouragements. The
kinetics of CO2-R1R2NH in aqueous solution has been intensively studied for decades with massive
publications since 1968. [2,4-21] A recent review [2] (2012) comprehensively described these kinetics
models with over 100 references. However, the heterogeneous catalysts of CO2 -R1R2NH has just been
discovered since 2013. Several publications have reported experimental results and verified the
catalysis, but there are very little precedent studies of heterogeneous in terms of “kinetic models with
reaction mechanism”. It is very difficult to develop these kinetic models with “mechanistic study”,
including reaction mechanism, elementary steps, rate determining steps and rate equations. Therefore,
we have no choice but to develop the Apparent Rate Law from Steady State approximation [26] and
verify reaction kinetics the model with experimental data: the definition of reaction rates “r = dCA/dt”
with Integrated Analysis [27].
The investigations are time-consuming and require efforts on the kinetic model development and
mathematic equations. We have studied a large number of kinetic studies of non-catalytic CO2-MEA
(DEA) reactions since 1968. [4-21] We managed to generate massive rate equations within months. It
is difficult to generate rate equations and verify them with experimental data.
As mentioned, the math equations were explained with reference, and some symbols were checked
and modified in Support Information. The details of experimental data fitting were explained.
1
We will try our best to address these problems and fix the manuscript properly.
Below are more detailed comments:
Question 1. Operational conditions of Experiment
1. It was unclear to the reviewer that ethanol amine was pre-adsorbed to the
metal carbonates in the manuscript writing. It was revealed by the graphics
displaying the reaction schematic.
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion was well taken. The experimental procedures were indeed over-
simplified. This process was similar to that of other study [23], which focused on CO2-DEA absorption
with the aid of CaCO3 and MgCO3. The details were neglected to avoid duplication.
Fig. S1. Stirred Cell Reactor for Catalytic CO2-MEA interactions with a water scrubbing process.
A set of stirred-cell reactor was built with suspension of pelletized chemicals for the experiments,
and the internal diameter of the reactor was 8.4 cm, with a constant interfacial area of 55.4 cm2. The
solids were wrapped into two balls and suspended onto the gas-liquid interface. The intersection area
of two solid balls was about 9.8 cm2 (2.5 cm in diameter for each). The amine solvents were pre-filled
into the reactor, with part of the MEA molecules pre-adsorbed onto the solid surface. The reactor was
placed in a cool water bath with a magnetic stirrer. The CO2 flowrate was in the range of 1.0-1.5 L/min.
The thermometer was placed inside the reactor to detect the reaction temperature. Pure CO2 was
introduced to a water-scrubbing process and then flowed into the batch reactor containing amine
solvents with bubbles.
During the catalytic absorption process, the solid chemicals were wrapped and placed at the gas-
liquid interface within the stirred cell reactor first. Then the gas CO2 (100%) was introduced into the
reactor for reaction. Hence, part of the MEA was pre-absorbed onto the solid surface before reacting
with CO2 for catalytic absorption.
After introduced into amine solvents, CO2 reacted with MEA solvent via both non-catalytic and
2
catalytic reaction pathways. For the non-catalytic pathway, CO2 directly reacted with MEA solvent,
and the kinetics had been intensively studied. For the catalytic pathway, the CO2 reacted with the MEA
molecules pre-adsorbed onto the solid surface. The kinetics was the focus of this study.
Changes: Section 3.1 added paragraph 2, 3 (Same as Question 10)
The CO2 absorption process was similar to other works. [23] A set of stirred-cell reactor was built
with suspension of pelletized chemicals for the experiments, and the internal diameter of the reactor
was 8.4 cm, with a constant interfacial area of 55.4 cm2. The solids were wrapped into two balls and
suspended onto the gas-liquid interface. The intersection area of two solid balls was about 9.8 cm2 (2.5
cm in diameter for each). The amine solvents were pre-filled into the reactor, with part of the MEA
solvents pre-adsorbed onto the solid surface. The reactor was placed in a cool water bath with a
magnetic stirrer. The CO2 flowrate was in the range of 1.0-1.5 L/min. A thermometer was placed inside
the reactor to detect the temperature. Pure CO2 was introduced to a water-scrubbing process and then
flowed into the batch reactor containing amine solvents with bubbles.
After introduced into amine solvents, the CO2 reacted with MEA solvent via both non-catalytic and
catalytic reaction pathways. For the non-catalytic pathway, the CO2 directly reacted with MEA solvent,
and the kinetics had been intensively studied.[2] For the catalytic pathway, the CO2 reacted with the
MEA molecules pre-adsorbed onto the solid surface, which was the focus of this study.
Question 2. The Role of Reference 25 and the application
2. The authors proposed Eley-Rideal model to explain the reaction mechanism. While
the proposed idea is possible, the authors incorrectly stated that reference
25 claimed that their reactions followed Eley-Rideal reactions. The reviewer
read reference 25 and found that it claimed Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism
instead. The authors copied part of the figure in reference 25 and discussed
it in the supporting information. They should cite the materials clearly.
Response:
The reviewer raised a very important question, and we re-investigate the problems carefully.
We understand that reactions of CO2 + MeOH to synthesis DMC (Ref. 25 in 2016) claimed
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism (LH). Within that publication, they also cited two earlier
references (2003 and 2011), which claimed that the reaction was via Eley-Rideal mechanism (ER).
Whether this kinetics mechanism was LH or ER was determined by different types of solid
catalysts, which was not an undisputed conclusion.
References of ER mechanism:

295-301. (doi:10.1016/j.jcat.2016.06.003)
We studied the Results and Discussions in Ref [25] carefully. The authors could only “suggest”
that the reactions “may follow” LH mechanism “over ceria catalysts”. The mechanism was verified
by their experimental data, which was greatly affected by different catalysts.
The text of Ref [25]: “The discussed initial reaction rate kinetics experiments strongly suggest that the conversion
of methanol and CO2 to DMC over ceria catalysts follows a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism where the CO2
and methanol are binding to the catalyst in separate steps, consistent with previous kinetics studies modeling the
reaction from the reaction profile [16]. Interestingly, this result contrasts with that shown for the production of DMC
from methanol and carbon monoxide over copper zeolite catalysts, which were found to have a non-negative rate
order with respect to methanol and are believed to follow an ER mechanism [29]. This suggests that the production
of DMC from CO2 instead of CO may take a very different pathway for the production of DMC despite the apparent
similarity of the overall reaction.”
Changes of Reference:
A new reference was introduced as Ref 25 with Eley-Rideal Mechanism. The old

The reason we cite original Ref. [25] Martin et al. (2016):
We cited original [Ref. 25] because we focused on Derivations of apparent rate laws in
Supplementary Information instead of their results and conclusion.

Honestly, the methodology of derivations of apparent rate laws were important. We emphasize
on the development of elementary steps and derivation of rate laws and rate liming step.

Fig.1 Mechanisms of Catalytic carbamate formation based on Eley-Rideal model
Moreover, Fig. 8 included “Elementary mechanistic steps proposed for the formation of DMC from
CO2 and methanol by a Langmuir–Hinshelwood and an Eley–Rideal mechanism [16,18].” Apparent
rate law was shown for each step if the given step was significantly slower than the preceding step(s).
Honestly, the original ref. [25] was NOT cited for the final results and conclusions. Their
methodology of derivations of apparent rate laws was valuable. We emphasize on the development
of elementary steps and derivation of rate laws and rate liming/determining steps.

From our study, different reactions and catalysts would result in different mechanisms. The
experimental results would verify different rate models finally. That was the main reason that our model
was ER mechanism, different from theirs model of LH mechanism.
In conclusion, the methodology through which they developed the “Rate law if rate
determining” was the foundation of our study, which was based on steady state approximation. We
developed our “rate law if rate determining” based on their methodology.
(2) The major difference from their results and our study under ER mechanism.
Even under the Eley-Rideal mechanism that they tried to develop, the elementary steps were
different: 3 steps for them and 4 steps for us. Different elementary steps would derivate different rate
liming steps as follows:

(3) The main reason that ER mechanism are more suitable for our study
The biggest difference was the acid base properties of our study. For their studies under the
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, CO2 was acidic gas and MeOH steam was neutral. Both
molecules could be adsorbed onto the surface of ceria catalysts together via LH model: reactants A and
B were adsorbed onto solid surface first, and then reacted with each other.
However, for our case, CO2 is acidic but MEA (RNH2) consists of basic molecules. CaCO3,
MgCO3 and BaCO3 contain abundant basic active sites on the surface, and they were pre-absorbed with
MEA molecules. CO2 would instantly react with the MEA on the solid surface when the molecule was
approaching the solid surface rather than the adsorbed onto the solid surface. If CO2 was adsorbed onto
the solid surface without colliding any amine molecules, the carbamate formation did not occur at all.
The CO2 + MEA reaction on solid surface was more suitable for Eley-Rideal mechanism (ER): a gas-
phase reagent CO2 directly reacted with an adsorbed species (adspecies) of RR’NH.
Changes:
Several place were also corrected in text, that the ER model was applicable with CO2 + RR’NH
with catalyst MCO3. (This model was applicable under specific catalytic cases)
Section 1. Section 2.2 1st paragraph was modified.
As mentioned, both Eley-Rideal model and Langmuir-Hinshelwood model mechanisms were
applicable in the field of heterogeneous catalytic reactions on gas-solid interface [26]. After detailed
investigation and analysis, Eley-Rideal model could be more suitable for carbamate formation reaction
because of the acid-base nature of CO2 and RNH2. CaCO3, MgCO3 and BaCO3 contained abundant
basic active sites on the surface, and it was pre-absorbed with MEA molecules from experimental
procedures. From Figure 1, the CO2 molecules reacted with the MEA that was instantaneously adsorbed
on the solid surface when approaching the surface. CO2 was unlikely to be directly adsorbed onto the
solid surface. If CO2 was adsorbed onto the solid surface without collision of any amine molecules, the
carbamate formation reaction did not occur at all. In the Eley-Rideal mechanism, a gas-phase reagent
7
such as CO2 directly reacted with an adsorbed species (adspecies) RR’NH, and the product carbamate
either desorbed or remained adsorbed on the surface depending on the exothermic reaction [24]. Mostly,
the product desorbed the surface due to the heat release. [24]
Question 3. The term of liquid [OH-]
3. The manuscript mentioned a lot of unusual terms. The reviewer does not
understand the meaning of these terms. For example, what is liquid [OH-]?
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion was well taken. Some terms has been revised. The term “liquid [OH-]”
has been revised as “[OH-] anions in liquid phase” as emphasis on homogeneous catalysis.
Changes:
The term of “liquid [OH-]” has been revised as “[OH-] anions in liquid phase”.

Question 4. The term of <U+0001D42B><U+0001D40E><U+0001D407> - and<U+0001D424> <U+0001D40E><U+0001D407> - ,
4. Many of the mathematics symbols were not defined in the main text. It is
difficult to follow the discussions. For example, on page 5, line 24, what are
k (superscript: dot) (subscript: OH-) and r (superscript: dot) (subscript: OH-)?
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion was well taken. The introduction of kinetics studies required expansion
with more details within reaction mechanism (Section 2.1). To be honest, these mathematic symbols
were not defined by us, and all of them were quoted directly from references. [4-21] We only placed
the most relevant equations in the theory among hundreds of mathematic equations. Some backgrounds
were omitted to avoid the duplications.
*
After we carefully reviewed the references of kinetic studies, the symbol should be <U+0001D42B><U+0001D40E><U+0001D407> - and
<U+0001D424> *<U+0001D40E><U+0001D407>- , and it should be a star “*” rather than dot “.”[2, 21].
These symbols represented the reaction rates and rate constant of bicarbonate formation [6, 21]:
Bicarbonate formation:
CO2 + OH- <U+21CC> HCO3- [2, 6]
* *
rOH -
- = k OH- [OH ][CO2 ]; k *OH- = 8322 m3 /kmol at 298K [21]
The main reactions that occurred in the MEA-CO2-H2O system for kinetics study was listed below
[2,6], and Blauwhoff et al.(1983)[6] conducted the kinetics of CO2-Amine in aqueous solutions and
generated the main equations.

Bicarbonate formation CO2 + OH- <U+21CC> HCO3- [2,6]
Then, the overall reaction rate could be written as below, consisting of two parts:
*
rov = rCO2 -R1 R2 NH + rOH - = k ov [CO2 ]
= k app [Amine][CO2 ] + k *OH- [OH - ][CO2 ] [2,6]
Furthermore, Blauwhoff et al.(1983)[6] expanded the rate equations along with the rate constants
in detail. The overall rate constant k ov covers the contributions of both reactions as below:
k2,R1 R2 NH [R1 R2 NH][CO2 ]

Question 5. The reason to select BaCO3
5. Why was BaCO3 chosen for the evaluation?
Response:
The reviewer has proposed a good question. We selected three types of metal carbonates, CaCO3,
MgCO3 and BaCO3 as a group. They belonged to alkaline earth metals (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, etc) of IIA
group in the Periodic Table.
The kinetic model of this study was not only applicable to one metal carbonate, but also to a group
of metal carbonates from Periodic Table. Moreover, among the data base of 39 sets of (XA, t), 12 sets
were for CaCO3, 12 sets were for MgCO3 and 15 sets were for BaCO3. If without BaCO3, there were
only 24 sets.
Changes: Introduction Final paragraph
Within this study, …... surface of solid chemicals. “The CaCO3, MgCO3 and BaCO3 were selected
as a group, for the metals were alkaline-earth metals belonging to IIA group in the Periodic Table.”
Question 6. The title of Figure 1

Response:
There was only one figure for Figure 1. This “a” was the footnote of explanation of Title of Table

Question 7. The steady state approximation
7. It is unclear to the reviewer why r3 is zero for B3 when B1 is the rate
determining step. According to the elementary step, B3 is a one direction
elementary step reaction.
Response:
The reviewer has raised a good question. The rate models based on “Steady-State approximation”
as a classical method in the kinetics of reaction rates. If B1 was the rate determining step, r1 <U+2260> 0, and
the rates of r2, r3 and r4 were very small and set to 0.
10
r1 <U+2260> 0, r2 = r3 = r4 = 0. “Steady-State approximation”.
Many other researchers developed the Apparent rate law with this approximation. [25, 26]
The “Steady-State approximation” was introduced. Below was its definition in Wikipedia.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state_(chemistry)#Reaction_rates
“Steady state approximation in chemical kinetics. The steady state approximation, occasionally
called the stationary-state approximation, involves setting the rate of change of a reaction
intermediate in a reaction mechanism equal to zero so that the kinetic equations can be simplified
by setting the rate of formation of the intermediate equal to the rate of its destruction.
In practice, it is sufficient that the rates of formation and destruction are approximately equal,
which means that the net rate of variation of the concentration of the intermediate is negligible
compared to the formation and destruction, and the concentration of the intermediate varies slowly.”
Therefore, the introduction of steady-state approximation was explained in Theory.
Changes: Section 2.3 1st paragraph
“It was originated from the steady-state approximation, a classical method in the kinetics of
reaction rates. [25-27] The steady-state approximation involved setting the rate of change of a reaction
intermediate in a reaction mechanism equal to zero, and then kinetic equations could be simplified. For
instance, if B1 assumed to be the rate-determining step, the rest 3 steps were regarded as steady-state,
and the rate of formation of the intermediate equaled to the rate of its destruction, so that the overall
apparent rates r2 to r4 were set to 0.”
Question 8. The typos
8. There are many typos in the manuscript. For example, “concertation” on page
9, line 16.
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion has been well adopted and the whole manuscript was carefully
proofread to remove these typos.
Question 9. The equations of XA vs a
9. There is an error for equation (12). It should be [C] = CA0 times a = ½ CA0
(1- XA ). The manuscript lacks clear derivations of the rate equations.
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion is honored. We reviewed the equation (10-12) carefully, and we
discovered that Eqn(10) is wrong and Eqn(12) is correct. The revised equations should be:
11
XA = 2 <U+F0CE> a (10) (a < 0.40; XA < 0.80)
[Amine] = CA0 (1 - 2<U+F0CE> a) = CA0 (1-XA) (11)
[CCarbamate ] = CA0 <U+F0CE> a = ½ CA0 XA (12)
The equations were developed from carbamate formation reaction at CO2 loading < 0.40 mol/mol:
2 R1R2NH + CO2 <U+21CC> R1R2N-COO- (Carbamate) + R1R2NH+
CA0 0 0 Initial
CA0 (1-2a) CA0 a CA0 a a loading
CA0 (1-XA) (free amine) 1/2CA0XA 1/2CA0XA XA conversion
Therefore, XA = 2 <U+F0CE> a.
The conversion was two times of CO2 loading based on the stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 of eqn (1).
For MEA, this equation was valid at range of 0-0.40 mol/mol based on ion speciation plot.
Moreover, [A] represented the concentration of free amine, and it was modified as [Amine]. [C]
represented the concentration of carbamate and it was modified as [CCarbamate ].
Changes: Eqs(10-12) was revised and re-numbered to (12-14)as below:
XA = 2 <U+F0CE>a (12) (a < 0.40; XA < 0.80)
[Amine] = CA0 (1 - 2<U+F0CE> a) = CA0 (1-XA) (13)
[CCarbamate ] = CA0 <U+F0CE> a = ½ CA0 XA (14)
Question 10. The experimental procedures
10. The manuscript lacks detailed experimental procedures for reproducing the
materials.
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion is well taken, and the detailed procedures was provided into the
manuscript. The experimental procedure of CO2 absorption with MEA was similar to other publication
[23], which is CO2 adsorption with DEA with CaCO3 and MgCO3. This question is similar to Q1, and
we solve them together.
Changes: Section 3.1 added paragraph 2, (Same as Question 1)
Question 11. The criteria of data selection with R2 > 0.99
11. The authors should justify why they chose R2 > 0.990 as the criteria for good
fittings of the data.
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion was taken, some backgrounds need to be explained.
12
The heterogeneous catalysis of CO2 reaction with R1R2NH has been recently discovered since 2013.
Several publications has already verified the catalysis with experimental results, [23,30] but there are
very little precedent studies of mechanistic models. The development of elementary steps with
derivation of apparent rate law model was the same as reference [25, 26], and presented in Table 2.

However, it was also difficult to verify the kinetic mechanism with B1 or B2, because most
reactions occurred on the solid surface and the parameters of K1-K4 were also unknown. We have no
choice but to verify the rate model from the fundamental of reaction kinetics: the definition of reaction
rate “r = dCA/dt”.[27] Based on the Textbook of “Chemical Reaction Engineering”, the method was
“Integrated analysis”.[27] This method has been rarely adopted since most kinetic models were verified
based on precedent publications.
Integrated Analysis of rate models with selection criteria:
dX<U+0001D434>
The definition of reaction rates is “r = -dCA/dt = C<U+0001D434>0 (15)”. It was integrated and adopted CA
<U+0001D451><U+0001D461>
= CA0(1-XA) with different formats of rate equations (r) at the left side. We established the direct
dX<U+0001D434>
correlation of “r = C<U+0001D434>0 ” with its integrated format of “F(XA) = Kt”. We developed several different
<U+0001D451><U+0001D461>
integrated rate equations of F(XA) = Kt representing different rate equations (r) from (B1) and (B2)
under several sub-cases. There was only one set of dataset of (XA, t) that were obtained from
experiments. However, there were several different formats of F(XA) based on different rate equations
(r) in Table 2. Consequently, there was one accurate model fitting data (XA, t) among Eq(16-18)
including different subcases.
These integrated rate equations (16-18) were developed with a general format of “F(XA) = K t”,
which was a linear equation of “y = k x”. For each set of data (F(XA), t) based on (XA, t), there were 5
points on one curve with different conversion of XA = 0.0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8. Different curves
of (F(XA), t) reflect different r.
If the curve of “F(XA) = Kt” was linear and straight, it meant (F(XA), t) was fitting for the model
13
and its specific rate equation (r) was also fitting for the mechanism. The higher R2 of the lines of F(XA)
dX<U+0001D434>
= Kt indicated the better fitting of the dataset of “r = C<U+0001D434>0 ” responds to experimental dataset of (XA,
<U+0001D451><U+0001D461>
t). Therefore, we selected the highest standard R2 > 0.99 as the criteria.
Changes: Section 3.3,was totally modified as below.
There was little precedent research of rate model verification of the developed equations of B1-
B4 in Table 2 and the parameters of K1-Kx were hard to calculate, so that the rate equations needed to
<U+0001D451><U+0001D436><U+0001D434>
be verified from the definition of reaction rates <U+0001D45F><U+0001D434> = - as the fundamental of reaction
<U+0001D451><U+0001D461>
kinetics.[27] With database of (XA, t) in Table SA.1-3, “Integral Method of Analysis” was adopted for
rate equation validation[7], which was a fundamental methodology of chemical reaction
engineering.[27]
dX<U+0001D434>
The goal was to establish the direct correlation of “r = C<U+0001D434>0 (15)” with its integrated format
<U+0001D451><U+0001D461>
of “F(XA) = Kt”. We developed several proper integrated equations of F(XA) = Kt with the combination
of the definition of reaction rate of Eq(15) and the specific format of reaction rate (r) of Eqn(16-18) in
order to verify B1 or B2 as the rate determining step. The [CO2] was not included, for it had already
been verified as the 1st order for absorption.[2]
The rate equation of CO2 absorption was Eq(15) by amine concentration (CA) or conversion (XA) at
the right side:

For the left side, <U+0001D45F><U+0001D434> = f (XA) was adopted by either B1 or B2 in Table 2. The integrated rate
equations were carried-out with Eq(16-18) under different sub-cases with brief analyses in Appendices.
There was only one set of dataset of (XA, t) obtained from experiments. However, there were several
different formats of F(XA) Eq(16-18) based on different rate equations (r) in Table 2. Consequently,
there was one accurate model fitting data (XA, t) among Eq(16-18), different subcases included.

selected by 0.05, 0.025 and 0.005, representing that 10%, 5% and 1% of the total active sites were
covered with carbamate. The extreme condition was also tested, where ka = 0 (similar to 0th order).
Each sub-case of Eqs(16-18) was verified by 39 sets of experimental data of (XA, t). Each set of
(XA, t) with its specific parameter (concentration, catalyst, mass i.e. 1.0 mol/L, CaCO3, 5g) generated
different sets of (F(XA), t) based on different RDS of Eq (16-18). Different curves of (F(XA), t) reflected
different rate equations (r). For each set of data (F(XA), t), there were 5 points with different conversion
of XA = 0.0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8. These curves of (F(XA), t) could be either linear or curvy.
These integrated rate equations (16-18) were developed with a general format of “F(XA) = K t”,
which was a linear equation of “Y = k X”. If the curves of (F(XA), t) were linear and straight, it meant
(F(XA), t) was quite fitting for “F(XA) = K t” of Eqs(16-18), and its related specific rate equation (r)
was fitting for the mechanism of B1 or B2. The higher R2 of the lines of “F(XA) = Kt” of Eqs(16-18)
dX<U+0001D434>
indicated the better fitting of the dataset of “r = C<U+0001D434>0 ” responded to experimental dataset (XA, t).
<U+0001D451><U+0001D461>
Therefore, we selected the highest standard R2 > 0.99 as the criteria. After repeated verifications of 39
sets of experimental data (XA, t) with-linear regressions, the set containing most lines of R2 > 0.99 of
Eqs(16-18) were verified as the highly accurate rate model.

Question 13. The errors of experimental data
13. What are the error bars for the experimental data?
Response:
The reviewer has mentioned a very good question. Our dataset of (XA, t) was calculated based on
the experimental data of CO2 loading of (a, t) of CO2 absorption profile.
The CO2 loading (a) of the amine solution was tested for different amine samples (1ml each time)
16
from a set of Chittick apparatus, and the AAD% of the experimental tests was about 2.5%. [23] The
error and deviation were repeatedly reported.
CO2 loading was calculated based on the equations at 298K:

The absorption profile of CO2 loading (a) vs time were completed elsewhere. The CO2 loading (a)
of the amine solutions was tested from Chittick apparatus, and the AAD% of the experimental tests
was 2.5%. [23] The conversion of amines XA was calculated from CO2 loading (a) with equations
below.
Question 14. Our method of F(XA) vs time vs power law model of rate order
14. It is difficult to evaluate the rate law by fitting the F(Xa) vs time. It is
better to directly extract the order of reactions with respect to each reactants
from the experimental data.
Response:
The reviewer has raised a very important point, and it has to be discussed in detail. We have already
extracted the order of reactions with [MEA] from the experimental data right after the experiments.
The rate order was calculated and discussed at the last part of R&D. (Check Summary of this
manuscript below). The reaction rate was the 1st order for both catalytic and non-catalytic absorptions
for [MEA]. The way of presenting rate order was the same as others [26], which presented rate order
at the end of R&D.
The method quoted from the reviewer was the “Power Law model” with a graphic method of
kinetics, but it was an over-simplified model lacking important information related to intrinsic
mechanism.
(1) The results of our study related to rate order:
The verified rate equation of our study was RDS = B1, with equation (B1) based on the experimental
data. Desorption of Carbamate resulted in the very low value of K4[C], and then the rate equation was
simplified again to <U+0001D45F>1 = <U+0001D43E><U+0001D435> [<U+0001D434>] (B5), which was the pseudo-first order for MEA.

<U+0001D45F>1 = <U+0001D43E><U+0001D435> [<U+0001D434>] Pseudo 1st order for [MEA] (B5)
17
Even the reaction order was the 1st order of (B5), the same for catalytic reaction and non-catalytic
reaction, the rate model and intrinsic mechanism were different. The (B5) was a simplified rate
equation, and our study revealed much important information besides rate order and rate constant.
Summary of our Study had been provided in Cover letter:
“This work involved a mechanistic and kinetic study of a specific heterogeneous catalytic reaction of CO2
+ primary/secondary amines (RR’NH) via carbamate (RR’N-COO-) formation. (1) A new mechanism was
proposed as the Eley-Rideal model. (2) Four elementary reaction steps were developed based on the mechanism.
(3) The rate laws if rate determining of these 4 steps were developed with full and simplified formats. (4) The
rate determining step of the special case of MEA was determined as the 1st step: amine adsorption onto the solid
surface. (5) The rate order was pseudo-1st order for MEA, and the enhancement of solid chemicals was 1.2-
2.0 times higher than the 2nd rate constant “kz” with existence of different masses and types of CaCO3, MgCO3
and BaCO3.”
(2) The power law model among the methods of kinetic study development:
Based on a review of kinetic study of non-catalytic CO2-amine reactions [2]. The absorption rate
data of CO2 absorption equipment were interpreted by means of Stage (1) graphical methods such as
Power Law Model, Stage (2) simplified kinetics models based on reaction mechanisms (i.e., zwitterion,
termolecular or base-catalyzed hydration mechanisms), and Stage (3) comprehensive numerically
solved reaction kinetics models that coupled with chemical equilibrium, mass-transfer and kinetics of
all possible reactions.
The “Power Law Model” was a straightforward but over-simplified one. This graphical method was
used from 1980s to mid-1990s to determine the order of reaction, and the reaction rate constant of
MEA, DEA, TEA and AMP. [2] Generally, the reaction order with respect to [CO2] was the 1st for all
aqueous–amine solutions. [2] The power law model could extract the rate order of the reactions directly,
but it could not provide detailed intrinsic reaction mechanism or detailed information of the kinetics,
such as elementary steps, rate determining steps, the molecular interactions, etc.
Based on the review of kinetics [2], the Power Law Model (1) was not better than kinetics models
based on reaction mechanisms (2) which involved verification of the apparent rate law by fitting the
F(Xa) vs time.
(3) The purpose of using F(XA) = K t is for rate model verification
Based on Appendices, there were several rate equations corresponding to different RDS with B1
18
(Amine adsorption) or B2 (Zwitterion formation with N-C bond formation) under different sub-cases.
Each case should be equally treated to special amine MEA.
The fitting F(XA) vs time was conducted in order to verify the most suitable rate equations among
different RDS with corresponding experimental dataset (XA, t). This process was time consuming, but
it was necessary to verify the correct rate-determining steps (RDS) for special cases of MEA to reveal
the reaction mechanism on the solid surface. The rate model verification with experiment data by fitting
F(XA) vs time was very important.
Changes: Section 4.3, 3rd Paragraph
Based on Eq(16), <U+0001D45F>1 = <U+0001D43E><U+0001D435> [<U+0001D434>]. This equation also indicated that the heterogeneous catalytic CO2
absorption was the pseudo 1st order with respect to [MEA], the same as non-catalytic absorption. The
rate of heterogeneous catalytic CO2-MEA absorption was Eq(19), similar to Eq(4) of non-catalytic
absorption. Despite the same reaction orders, the mechanisms and rate constants were different under
catalytic and non-catalytic absorptions. The reaction order could also be directly extracted from
graphical method based on the experimental data [2], but the Power Law model was a straightforward
but over-simplified method lacking detailed intrinsic reaction mechanism and elementary steps.[2] The
developing rate law based on the definition of reaction rate was hard and time-consuming, but it
accurately verified the mechanism and elementary steps.

Reviewer 2:
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript proposed a new model for heterogeneous catalytic CO2-RR’NH
interactions. The reaction process, the elementary steps, and rate limiting steps
was developed. These results are useful for further studies with secondary amines
etc. This manuscript is worth publication.
Several small problems need to be edited to improve the quality:
Question 1. The kinetic of R3N in introduction.
1. Introduction:
(1) It is mentioned mostly that the reaction of CO2 with primary amine and secondary
amine, but little of CO2 with tertiary amine. Please mention the reactions with
tertiary amine to complete the full map of kinetics.
Response:
The CO2 absorptions with primary and secondary amines (MEA and DEA) possess the similar
reaction schemes with carbamate as product and involve Zwitterion mechanism [4].
2 RR’NH + CO2 <U+F0DF><U+F0E0> RR’N-COO- (carbamate) + RR’NH2+ (1)
For tertiary amines, the CO2 absorption has the different reaction scheme with bicarbonate as
product and involves ‘Base Catalyzed hydration mechanism’ [2].
R1R2R3N + CO2 + H2O <U+F0DF><U+F0E0> HCO3- (bicarbonate) + R1R2R3NH+ (2)
Changes: Section 1, Introduction: Line 10, added:
“For the CO2 reactions with tertiary amines, the product is bicarbonate (HCO3-) and the
mechanism is “Base Catalyzed hydration Mechanism”. [2] For the CO2 reactions with primary and
secondary amines, the product is carbamate (RR’N-COO-) and the mechanism is mostly Zwitterion
mechanism [4, 6], except for Termolecular mechanism under special cases [17]. The focus of this study
was based on the Zwitterion mechanism of carbamate formation with heterogeneous catalysis.”
Question 2. How to obtain activation energy Ea for reaction.
2. Theory
(2) In Section 2.2 of reaction (B2), the author mentioned the activation energy
(Ea) of carbamate formation. The Ea of non-catalytic reaction can be calculated
from rate constant from kinetic analysis. How to obtain the Ea of catalytic reaction?
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion is well taken, and the activation energy of catalytic reaction could be
obtained with two possible methods.
20
The 1 st method is also calculated from rate constant from kinetic analysis. The reaction rates are
tested under different temperatures and with the equation of lnk = Ea/RT.
The 2 nd method involves molecular simulation. The Ea could be calculated with software
simulation such as Gaussian 09. The Ea is the energy difference between the transition state and the
ground state of reactants.
Changes: Section 2.2 Theory, Paragraph 3
The exact activation energy of (B2) was not tested, but it could be calculated with simulation or
tested with further kinetic analysis with the equation of lnk = Ea/RT.
Question 3. The application of B1-B4 to R3N
(3) Why these elementary steps B1-B4 unsuitable for tertiary amine? Please explain
briefly.
Response:
The elementary steps B1-B4 are unsuitable because there is no carbamate generated within the
CO2-R3N reactions.
Similar to Question #1, the reason is also due to different reaction schemes, mechanisms, and
products of CO2-R3N reactions (bicarbonate rather than carbamate).

From B1 to B4 in Table 2, these elementary steps involve carbamate (RNH-COO-) as products.
However, the main product is bicarbonate (HCO3-) for CO2 reaction with tertiary amines (R1R2R3N).
Changes: Section 2.2 Theory Last paragraph.
“These elementary steps were suitable for both primary and secondary amines (MEA, DEA,
DIPA, MMEA etc., with unified form of RR’NH) with “carbamate (RR’N-COO-)” as product. However,
they were unsuitable for tertiary amine (R3N). The CO2-R3N reactions involved different reaction
schemes, mechanisms and products. The main product was bicarbonate (HCO3-) for CO2 reaction with
tertiary amines (R1R2R3N) so that B1-B4 were unsuitable for it.”

Question 4. The reaction process on the solid surface
3. Result and Discussion
(4) Section 4.3 First paragraph, “The solid surface had abundant empty active
sites with very few carbamate adsorbed.” Please provide a detailed explanation of
this sentence.
Response:
The reviewers’ suggestion is taken, and the overall adsorption process were briefly introduced.
Changes: Section 4.3, second paragraph
“The overall CO2 absorption process with existence of solid alkaline was briefly explained from B1
to B4 in Table 2. The amine adsorbed onto the surface from liquid phase firstly, with relatively slow
rate (B1). Then CO2 reacted with MEA (RNH2) with N-C bond formation (B2). The rate was
instantaneous and enhanced with heterogeneous catalysis. The Zwitterion released proton to H2O or
other base to generate carbamate (RNH-COO-) and the exothermic reaction released heat (B3). The
released heat facilitated diffusion and drove desorption of carbamate back to the aqueous phase (B4).
The carbamate finally desorbed the surface due to the exothermic reaction. [24] Mostly the product
desorbed the solid surface due to the heat release, and there was little carbamate remained.”
Question 5. The future work
(5) Last paragraph, “This Eley-Rideal model still awaits much further analyses
with updated experimental apparatus”, what types of experiments did you wish to
conduct as the next task?
Response:
The reviewer raised a good question. This model requires massive data for improvements and
verifications. Two types of studies could be carried out next:
(1) The in situ study of a new solid base catalyst, KMgO/CNTs (carbon nanotubes), which was
reported [30] recently to be useful for CO2-MEA absorption. This work proves the applicability of
this model to CO2-MEA with various solid base catalysts.
(2) The molecular simulation can be performed for CO2-MEA reactions with existence of CaCO3 with
Gaussian 09. The reactant, transition state and product can be simulated and the energy can be
calculated to address the activation energy Ea of the catalytic absorption. After compared with Ea
of non-catalytic absorption, the effectiveness of catalysts can be measured quantitatively.
Changes: Last paragraph of Section 4.3
The molecular simulation needed to be calculated of catalytic CO2-MEA reactions with existence
of CaCO3 with Density Function Theory (DFT) to discover Ea of the catalytic absorption. The kinetic
22
analysis of another solid base “KMgO/CNT (carbon nano-tubes)” with ER model could be performed
since this material was reported to be effective for CO2-MEA absorption recently. [30]
Question 6. The RDS among B1 – B4 for DEA
4. Conclusions
(6)For catalytic CO2-DEA reaction with this model, is RDS still B1?
Response:
The reviewer has raised a very good question. The answer remains unknown, which requires
numerous studies with intensive literature review and detailed investigations.
The B1-B4 are suitable for most primary and secondary amines such as MEA and DEA. However,
each amine has different rate constant, and the verification of RDS requires both theoretical analysis
and experimental tests.
For MEA, the case is easier and straight forward since the CO2 reaction with MEA is instantaneous
and the reaction order is 1. For DEA, the case is special, because the reaction order is between 1-2 of
[DEA]. We can only make such statement now. The RDS should belong to any step of B1-B4, but it
requires intensive literature studies and experimental results based on highly accurate kinetic studies
with specialized reactor to verify the equations properly.
Changes: Conclusions Line 4,
For DEA, the rate-determining step was among B1-B4, but it required intensive literature studies
and experimental results based on highly accurate kinetic studies with specialized reactor to verify the
equations properly.
Question 7. The dominant effect of increased reaction rates
(7) Last sentence, the increased reaction rates is result in either mass
transfer or reduced activation energy. Which part is dominant and How to distinguish
these effects?
Response:
The reviewer has raised a good question. For the catalyst, there are several steps during catalytic
process. They are external diffusion, internal diffusion, adsorption, surface reactions, internal diffusion,
external diffusion and desorption.
Both parts are important, for the catalyst not only enhances the mass transfer with active sites on
the surface but also reduces the activation energy (Ea) to accelerate reactions. However, based on the
Arrhenius equation, the reduction of Ea is more important.
23
There are different experiments to test these effects. The effect of mass transfer study can be
conducted in a CO2 absorber to test kGav. The activation energy can be calculated with molecular
simulation first and then calculated based on Arrhenius equation with experimental data of kinetic
analyses.
Changes: Conclusion, Last sentence
“The reduction of activation energy Ea was more important in accelerating reaction rates. The
effect of mass transfer could be calculated from kGav on the basis of experiments, and Ea could be
calculated from either molecular simulation or Arrhenius equation with the aid of experimental data of
kinetics analyses.”

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors answer most of the questions from reviewers. There are two minor but
necessary modifications needed:
1. In the described mechanisms, the arrows showed the direction of the molecule
(such as CO2) attacking the adsorbed amines. This counters the common convention
that the arrows indicate the flow direction of the electrons. Using this example,
the lone pair electrons from the N of the amine should attack the carbon of the CO2
to form the C-N bond. So under the usual convention, the direction of the arrow
should go from the amine to the carbon of the CO2. The authors should use the typical
convention instead.
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion was very good, the reaction is the long pair electrons on the N atom of
amine to attach to C atom of CO2.
Changes: The new Figure 1 was generated
2. There are many typos, random capitalization of words and missed subscripts in
the manuscript and the references. There are too many of them to be listed here.
These to be corrected.
Response:
The reviewer’s suggestion was taken, and we proofread the whole manuscript
thoroughly.
