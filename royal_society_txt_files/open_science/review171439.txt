Review of “Ecological and evolutionary significance of a lack of capacity for extended
developmental arrest in crocodile eggs” by Sean Williamson et al. for Royal Society Open Science
Thank you for the opportunity to review this very interesting and well written paper. The
questions addressed are important, the study was well designed, and I can add little to improve
an elegant study and strong manuscript that will be a significant contribution to the literature.
The authors are to be congratulated for undertaking such a challenging study (having to obtain
eggs immediately after deposition in large crocodilians) and conducting such a detailed study
with important evolutionary implications.
The few minor points I have are listed below, and I marked similar comments on the manuscript
which I will scan and try to attach.
Lines 28 – 31 and elsewhere (line 121, lines 251-252) - I was concerned with the use of the term
“pre-ovipositional” embryonic arrest throughout the study, since the eggs were actually collected
after natural oviposition, though I do recognize the authors collected the eggs almost
immediately after egg deposition, and there is no way to experimentally change the oxygen levels
while the eggs are still in the oviduct. Perhaps just temper the discussion and conclusions and say
crocodiles may not be capable of pre-ovipositional embryonic arrest, based on results from
experiments conducted as soon as possible after egg deposition.
Line 37 – perhaps define K – and r-selected species traits or merge the first two sentences of the
Introduction
Line 40 – might omit the part about parental care when you are discussing common traits in
turtles and crocodilians, since crocodilians have parental care and turtles do not as you noted,
thus it’s really not a shared trait/behavior
Line 83 – not sure eggs were actually “chilled” but Lang and Andrews (1994 Journal of
Experimental Zoology 270:28-44 on TSD in crocodilians) showed at cooler temperatures 28 C
alligator eggs complete development but fail to hatch (embryo mortality >90%); that review
paper may have info on other crocodilian embryos at lower temps
Lines 175 – 176 – were the pipes kept level, or slanted downward to “encourage” locomotion?
Did the crocodiles walk/swim spontaneously, without requiring being prodded?
Line 185 – use ml instead of spelling out milliliters?
Line 271 – might cite Joanen et al 1977 (Effects of simulated flooding on alligator eggs) showed
flooding at two days (48 hours) caused total mortality; though sample sizes were small in the
study; thus perhaps only two days of flooding is needed rather than the three days suggested in
line 271?
Line 304 – reference [49] Elsey and Trosclair (2008) - the conclusions of the study were to
recommend early egg collection (“relocation”) by ranchers to avoid natural mortality factors such
as flooding, depredation, and improve post-hatching growth by extending the time for optimum
incubation temperatures in a controlled setting rather than exposing eggs to fluctuating temps in
the field – it did not intend to imply anything about mechanical trauma or optimal timing of egg
collection to minimize transport/mechanical injury to the embryo as the authors seem to indicate
by its use here (sorry if that was unclear in the publication). That said, I do agree eggs seem to
tolerate transportation best within the first 24 hours after oviposition, or when they are well
advanced (over 4 weeks or even older), but there seems to be a “critical period” from
approximately the first to third week when they seem more prone to mechanical trauma in
transport; but not sure that reference “fits” here since the point of the study was not to address
timing of egg collection/relocation to avoid mechanical trauma
Line 338 – good the authors acknowledge this point, but I don’t think the study could have been
done any better – it’s remarkable the eggs were able to be collected and placed in the
3
experimental treatment groups so quickly after deposition; agree the VERY brief period of
normoxia probably was not a problem
Lines 347-348 – same as above – the study could not have been done any better – it must be nearly
impossible for researchers to be present at the nest at the exact moment oviposition commences.
Might note how long it typically takes for the whole clutch to be deposited (30 – 45 minutes?)
Literature Cited – in numerous places there are titles of articles with the first letter of each word
in upper case (and should these be lower case?) and numerous scientific names of species are not
in italics and maybe should be?
Figure 2 and 3 – if there is room it might help to use “Hypox” rather than just “Hyp.” for the
hypoxic legends
Figure 4 – maybe show the actual numbers of dead embryos in each category (rather than, or in
addition to) the percentages, to show the tremendous difference with much higher mortality
under hypoxic (n = 28) conditions rather than only (n = 7 died) under control and hyperoxic
treatments. Percentages aren’t’ quite as dramatic, but still it’s well illustrated either way

This is an interesting manuscript that reports an interesting study. The data that indicate that
hypoxia does not cause developmental arrest in crocodiles are important. Your manuscript is
made less strong by the old fashioned way in which you write in the passive voice, That makes
the agent of action unclear, and makes the manuscript clumsy. Please rewrite in the active voice.
In addition, you had a nice hypothesis, a nice experimental design, adequate statistics and good
data. So please state that your data did or did not support your hypothesis. You state that you
found evidence for one thing and did not find evidence for another. I did not think that the eggs
were on trial. Data are the coin of science. Evidence is the coin of the legal profession. Or did you
have a conclusion when you started that you then collected evidence to prove?

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
We have now received two reviews of your submitted article. Both reviewers agree that the
subject matter is of interest and contributes to the literature of reptilian reproduction. Both
reviewers recommend acceptance after minor revisions. Reviewer 1 has an extensive list of small
comments that you should consider seriously. Reviewer 2 has no specific comments for changes
in the results or discussion, but feels that you could have avoided the passive voice more often
than what they saw in your manuscript. As associate editor I have also read the manuscript and I
found that you did use the direct voice ("We measured... we observed...") fairly often. Maybe you
could introduce the direct voice in a few more places. I am also not entirely sure what the
reviewer meant by his comment regarding hypothesis and conclusion, as your results were pretty
clear to me - again, maybe you can find some places in your result sections where you could add
a strong conclusion sentence at the bottom of those paragraphs ("In summary, these results let us
conclude that ...).
Overall, the revisions should be minor and should not require re-review, as long as you can
explain the changes that you introduced into the manuscript in your response letter. It should be
possible to accomplish this within a shorter time period.
Let us know if there are any questions or concerns.

have removed the term “pre-ovipositional” embryonic arrest from throughout the
nuscript. Lines 28, 31, 120, 124,
also tempered the Discussion and conclusions as suggested by the reviewer. Lines 260, 349,
, 368.
e 37 – perhaps define K – and r-selected species traits or merge the first two sentences of the

gator eggs complete development but fail to hatch (embryo mortality >90%); that review
er may have info on other crocodilian embryos at lower temps
e Lang and Andrew 1994 manuscript used extended incubation at a constant temperature of 28
which they found was not conducive of hatching. However, embryos completed development
the failure to hatch is likely a result of embryos being in a state of aestivation while waiting
a cue to hatch (such as an increase in temperature; see Rafferty & Reina 2012 Proc. Roy. Soc.
or further info on delayed hatching and late-stage embryonic aestivation). As far as we are
are, there is no published information on the effect of short-term (~3 days) chilling (<10°C) of
codilian eggs at the start of development. Such chilling is commonly performed on turtle eggs
rder to protect them from movement-induced mortality during transportation. Turtle eggs
lected at oviposition and chilled (<10°C) stay in pre-ovipositional embryonic arrest. We have
hlty modified the sentence to add clarity. Line 82.
es 175 – 176 – were the pipes kept level, or slanted downward to “encourage” locomotion?
the crocodiles walk/swim spontaneously, without requiring being prodded?
e pipes were kept level. This information has been included on line 176. The crocodiles
k/swam to the finishing end of the track in response to the presence of the researcher at the
t of the track. For added encouragement, the researcher lightly tapped a plastic pipe against
PVC track at the starting end of the track. This has been clarified on Lines 178-180.
