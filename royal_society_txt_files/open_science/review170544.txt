Review of the manuscript ID RSOS-160929 by Zahourek and Fieder, entitled „The effect of
mothers-in-law on the number of grandchildren. A cross-cultural analysis between Austria and
Vietnam”
The authors investigate the impact of mothers as well as mothers-in-law on fertility. I think the
research topic is interesting for the readership of Royal Society Open Science, but the paper is not
ready for publication in its current shape since it suffers from a few substantial methodological as
well as theoretical flaws.
Data Issues
The authors leave the reader in the dark why specifically Austria and Vietnam were chosen as
study populations from IPUMS international. This is surprising since IPUMS international
includes several dozen other countries and one wonders why especially the comparison between
Austria and Vietnam should be of great value to investigate mother and mother-in-law effects.
The authors should justify their choice carefully (e.g., promising differentials in household
compositions, etc.) and further I am wondering whether the impact of the study could be
improved if more populations were included.
Theoretical Aspects
The authors interpret their findings regarding the mother-in-law exclusively in the light of
paternity uncertainty. Although this explanation is widely used in the literature of evolutionary
anthropology to explain the opposite effects of mothers and mothers-in-law, there are several
other explanations discussed in the literature that should be mentioned and discussed in the
paper. First, the paper would benefit from the theoretical differentiation between mother and
mother-in-law effects that are due to behavior (or social interactions in broader sense) and those
that are due to common causes (e.g. wealth, SES, household quality). For instance, in
contemporary populations where extended families are less required for a higher standard of
living, matri- as well as patrilocality are often associated with low SES, whereas neolocality could
at least to some extent capture economic success. A similar explanation could also explain the
finding that biological mothers reduce fertility. Mothers who cohabit with their parents might
face a difficult and complicated stage of life (e.g., absence of husband, poor health,
unemployment, etc.). Further, in addition to paternity uncertainty, there are other behavior-
related reasons for mother-in-law effects. It has been argued that mothers-in-law might
reproductively exploit their daughters-in-law since they are genetically related to the children of
their daughters-in-law, but not to them (Voland & Beise 2004). This perspective differs from the
argument of paternity uncertainty since the mothers-in-law (all kin-in-law in general) are more
interested in the well-being of their sons’ children, but less in the well-being of their daughters-in-
law. This might be especially true in patrilocal societies where the mother is cut off from her natal
kin due to migration in the household of her husband’s family. In the in-laws’ households,
mothers are entirely dependent on their husbands and their family. In relation to mothers who
receive support from their natal kin, this circumstance might pose a major risk because a mother’s
access to resources of the in-law-lineage is only ensured fragilely and vulnerable to, for example,
accidents, sickness, or death of their husbands. However, there are also at least two antagonistic
(positive) mother-in-law effects. As the authors noted, the risk of paternity uncertainty is reduced
in a patrilocal population since the reproductive females are more or less guarded by the in-law-
family. Under such circumstances the relationship between daughters- and mothers-in-law might
be less conflict-laden. Also I am wondering to what extent intermarriage plays a role. In
traditional populations marriages between cousins are frequent and in such marriages the
mother-in-law is also a biological aunt.

Data Selection
I am worried about the authors’ method of handling the problem of incomplete reproduction. As
far as I understand the models, age is included as a control variable. This variable tells little about
since when the women were married (had been exposed to the risk of legitimate child bearing). If
possible the authors should investigate the impact of mothers on age-specific fertility. This could
also give insight how mothers-in-law are affecting fertility (via shorter inter birth intervals, etc.)
Other Points
- I miss a table with descriptive statistics. E.g. Proportion of households’ compositions.
- The whole manuscript is too short which often causes unclear passages. Also, some phrases lack
precision. For instance line 190 ”In Vietnam, grandmothers appear to more likely have a negative
effect on the grand-offspring.” What is meant by this? Does it mean that grandmothers reduce
survival of their grand-offspring or reduce their daughters’ fertility?
- It might be interesting to see how the control variables are affecting the variable of interest. I
suggest to start with a model that includes only individual traits (e.g. age, years married, …) and
stepwise include other characteristics. The results could be presented in the appendix or
supplement, but it would be interesting to see, for instance, how the inclusion of SES affects the
estimates of interest.

In this paper authors investigate the effect of grandparental co-residence on female fertility in
Austria and Vietnam. They find that paternal grandmothers tend to influence fertility more than
others. The strength of the paper is that the authors utilise large-scale Census panel data,
meaning that this could be a potentially interesting paper. Unfortunately, I think that authors
have done sloppy work and thus in it’s current form the paper is not suitable for publication.
Please find some more detailed comments below.
1. Many, many relevant studies concerning grandparental effects on parental fertility in
contemporary populations are missing (e.g., Coall et al., 2009; Fukukawa, 2013; Kaptijn et al.,
4
2010; Tanskanen et al., 2014; Waynforth, 2011). In addition, three important review articles are
missing (Coall & Hertwig, 2010; Euler, 2011; Sear & Coall, 2011).
2. It is not clear why authors study Austria and Vietnam. What is the relevance to study these
countries?
3. In lines 105–107 authors state that “There are, however, species that favour female-biased
dispersal. [7] Humans are such a species, tending to female dispersal and patrilocality. This
means that women move to their spouse’s household to live there in a co-residence with their
husbands and mothers-in-law. [8]” I believe that patrilocal co-residence is rather a response to
paternity uncertainty (i.e., males try to control females) than a species-specific cue for humans. In
fact, in modern “free” societies where individuals have option to decide where they live, females
do not tend to live closer to their husband’s kin than their own kin.
4. Material and methods are too shortly described. It is not clear what authors have actually done
and why.
5. Discussion section is also very short and not fully developed.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
In the first version of this ms the authors investigated the effect of grandparental co-residence on
female fertility in Austria and Vietnam. Now they have expanded their analyses to 14 countries
(and excluded the original two). In the first version they found that paternal grandmothers tend
to influence fertility more than their maternal counterparts. Now the results have changed. I still
believe that the main strength of the ms is that the authors utilise large-scale Census panel data.
Moreover, including 14 countries in the analyses may make a real contribution to the field
because authors can detect “more universal” trends compared to several prior studies. However,
I was unable to find a clear justification why it is important to use cross-country data. This should
be done in the introduction section. What new this brings to the field? What are the limitations of
using cross-country data? Overall, compared to the previous version, I think that the current
version is an improvement. However, I still think that the ms is not ready for publication. Below
you find some comments.
Summary
Line 25: ”…census data of 2,156,875 married women…” <U+2192> ”…census data of over two million
married women…”

Intro
You have chosen very different countries in your analyses. Please explain do you believe that the
effect should not vary between these countries? Why or why not? You should try to convince
readers that we really need a study based on cross-country analyses. Perhaps, you can cite to the
paper by Henrich et al. (2010, The weirdest people in the world. Behavioral and Brain Sciences,
33, 61–83).
Page 7, line 16: Authors state: ”Humans usually favour patrilocal female dispersal”. I am not
convinced that this is the case. In modern western societies (where women can choose where they
live) they do not usually live with their husbands’ kin. In contrast, women can favour their own
kin over their husband’s kin.
Discussion
I believe that you need try to provide a more comprehensive theoretical explanation for your
findings. Now critical reader (as myself) start to think that perhaps your findings are based on
data limitations (e.g., you were unable to restrict the analyses to 45+ women).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
This paper has much improved, and I am pleased to see the authors have done a broader multi-
national study. I think this paper is suitable for RSOS although I still think that it could be more
tightly pitched. The methods seem sound, and the results interesting. I have little more to criticise
but I do think the introduction in particular could be more focussed and a more convincing
argument put forward to make the paper really special.
Here are my comments:
The introduction gives a brief overview of the relevant literature but it needs to be clearer about
how this research is filling a gap. You talk of the value of grandparenting and you say a little bit
about post-marital dispersal but they seem to be quite loosely thrown together. You mention that
we know less about the lineage differences in grandparents and that we know little about
grandfathers and fathers. But this is not enough in itself. I think the introduction would be
strengthened by emphasizing why we want to know more about lineage differences, and you
should tie the various paragraphs together more tightly. For instance, the paragraph starting at
line 8 on page 7 comes across as an afterthought and I think would make more sense to (a) be
fleshed out a bit more and (b) situated earlier among the literature of the general benefits of
grandparents. I realise that this might seem like a stylistic issue but for this paper to be published
in RSOS, it needs improved cohesion and to exhibit confidence in what you are arguing.
Also, you wait until the last paragraph to mention that your variable of interest is number of
children. Please tell us why you chose this outcome – you have not emphasised why fertility in
particular is something we are interested in understanding with regard to grandparenting.
(Bearing in mind lots of literature looks at child survival and there is some on birth spacing, and
age at first birth.)
Methods:
Please provide more descriptive statistics. At least provide the distributions of each variable used.
It is impossible to make meaningful interpretations of the results without knowing things about
average education levels, mean age at marriage, and especially, average fertility in each country
sample.
Later on you say that women having own mother in the house had fewer children. Can we see
numbers for mean numbers of children for each household setup please?
Also, only after seeing table 1 do I realise that each sample is taken from a different time period.
Can you please say more about this, and more in general about the data and the sampling (there
seem to be pretty big differences in sample size too)? Does the random factor for sample account
for the period differences as well as the country differences?
Results:
Table 2: why do you put ‘neg’ or ‘pos’ instead of the actual coefficients? They would be much
more informative. You could still highlight the direction of the associations if you want to
emphasise this.
Table 3: (or in table 1) please include sample sizes for each country.
Figure 1: please label the y axis.
Discussion:
As you say in the first few paragraphs, there are likely to be cross-nationally different
explanations for the negative effect of grandmothers on fertility. Given that these are co-residing
grandmothers (also most common in low-income settings), the simplest explanation would be
11
resource competition. Regardless of whose mother it is, it is still another mouth to feed. There is
plenty in the literature on this – please add some discussion of this interpretation.
Further to your comments in the last part of the discussion; co-residence is also a fairly rare thing
in most of these countries – are you able to test what predicts co-residence? It might be useful to
look at this phenomenon by age – younger newly-weds live with their parents but older couples
might have the grandmothers live with them (say, after the grandfather dies). I realise your
sample is fairly young so this might not be discernible with these data, but it is worth
mentioning.
I recommended you say something in the introduction about the choice of fertility as the outcome
variable and why this is interesting/important. Please then also add something in the discussion
about this. From a Darwinian standpoint, we might be interested in numbers of children but can
we explain why earlier age at first birth is associated with nuclear families while lower fertility
comes with having grandmothers in the household?
Limitations:
Divorce might be rare (in some of these countries) but death is not. I appreciate that you cannot
help this and that this is a limitation, but that comment does not justify it. It might be better to say
that you somewhat make up for this by including only younger mothers in the analysis. Or drop
that sentence.
Minor points:
Title is clumsy and not quite accurate – it implies causality. Please change the ‘lowers a women’s
...’ to something denoting association.
Please give the name of the author(s) you are referring to and not just the reference number on
P6, line 45 and on P7, lines 25 and 36.
P8, paragraph starting at line 15. It sounds odd to talk about “joining the characteristics” of two
family members. Perhaps say that IPUMS has (and you have further) linked the data on these
individuals instead.

Manuscript ”Living with own or husband’s mother in the household lowers a woman’s number
of children: a cross-cultural analysis” investigates important and interesting topic. The results are
also of interest, especially because they contrast the previous findings made by historical and
present day data that state that the presence of grandmothers may increase the fertility. Although
the study is interesting and conducted with large data, there are some substantial flaws that
should be met until the manuscript could be published.
My main concerns focus on methods and theoretical issues (which are partly connected).
Methods:
If I have understood correctly, data used is cross-sectional including women of varying ages.
Thus, the results presented are associations and show difference between individuals in certain
time point. In addition, the data apparently does not tell how long grandmothers have lived with
their daughters or daughters-in-law – just the situation at the time point of census. This in mind,
the authors should be careful to use terminology which refers to causality such in the title
“..lowers a woman fertility..”
Authors discuss (p. 12, lines 12-29) the possibility that in different SES groups the presence of
grandmothers may have different association with the number of children but they could have as
well tested this with their data. Interaction between e.g., mother’s/father’s education and the
presence of grandmother could show how the association between number of children and the
presence of gms differ in different socioeconomic groups.
Regarding this, the authors should include more discussion and some references as well about
resource competition or local resource competition hypothesis (e.g. Strassmann, 2011; Strassmann
& Garrard, 2011, there could be some newer papers on the topic as well). Authors start to discuss
this a bit at the end of the Discussion section but they could develop this topic further (especially
because their results seems to support the hypothesis of (local) resource competition).
In figure 1 (a, b, c) the smoothed curves should be in the same figure so they could be compared
to each other.
Theory:
There is important difference that the authors seem to miss, between investments, contact or
support from grandparents who do not live with their children and grandparents who co-reside
with their children (and grandchildren). In three generational households grandparents,
especially very old grandparents, can be more of a resource competitors than providers of help
and support.
Smaller issues:
Some relevant references are missing. In addition to abovementioned e.g., Lahdenperä et al. 2004

Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper has much improved, and I am pleased to see the authors have done a broader multi-
national study. I think this paper is suitable for RSOS although I still think that it could be more
tightly pitched. The methods seem sound, and the results interesting. I have little more to criticise
but I do think the introduction in particular could be more focussed and a more convincing
argument put forward to make the paper really special.
Here are my comments:
The introduction gives a brief overview of the relevant literature but it needs to be clearer about
how this research is filling a gap. You talk of the value of grandparenting and you say a little bit
about post-marital dispersal but they seem to be quite loosely thrown together. You mention that
we know less about the lineage differences in grandparents and that we know little about
grandfathers and fathers. But this is not enough in itself. I think the introduction would be
strengthened by emphasizing why we want to know more about lineage differences, and you
should tie the various paragraphs together more tightly. For instance, the paragraph starting at
line 8 on page 7 comes across as an afterthought and I think would make more sense to (a) be
fleshed out a bit more and (b) situated earlier among the literature of the general benefits of
grandparents. I realise that this might seem like a stylistic issue but for this paper to be published
in RSOS, it needs improved cohesion and to exhibit confidence in what you are arguing.
Also, you wait until the last paragraph to mention that your variable of interest is number of
children. Please tell us why you chose this outcome – you have not emphasised why fertility in
particular is something we are interested in understanding with regard to grandparenting.
(Bearing in mind lots of literature looks at child survival and there is some on birth spacing, and
age at first birth.)
Methods:
Please provide more descriptive statistics. At least provide the distributions of each variable used.
It is impossible to make meaningful interpretations of the results without knowing things about
average education levels, mean age at marriage, and especially, average fertility in each country
sample.
Later on you say that women having own mother in the house had fewer children. Can we see
numbers for mean numbers of children for each household setup please?
Also, only after seeing table 1 do I realise that each sample is taken from a different time period.
Can you please say more about this, and more in general about the data and the sampling (there
seem to be pretty big differences in sample size too)? Does the random factor for sample account
for the period differences as well as the country differences?
Results:
Table 2: why do you put ‘neg’ or ‘pos’ instead of the actual coefficients? They would be much
more informative. You could still highlight the direction of the associations if you want to
emphasise this.
Table 3: (or in table 1) please include sample sizes for each country.
Figure 1: please label the y axis.
16
Discussion:
As you say in the first few paragraphs, there are likely to be cross-nationally different
explanations for the negative effect of grandmothers on fertility. Given that these are co-residing
grandmothers (also most common in low-income settings), the simplest explanation would be
resource competition. Regardless of whose mother it is, it is still another mouth to feed. There is
plenty in the literature on this – please add some discussion of this interpretation.
Further to your comments in the last part of the discussion; co-residence is also a fairly rare thing
in most of these countries – are you able to test what predicts co-residence? It might be useful to
look at this phenomenon by age – younger newly-weds live with their parents but older couples
might have the grandmothers live with them (say, after the grandfather dies). I realise your
sample is fairly young so this might not be discernible with these data, but it is worth
mentioning.
I recommended you say something in the introduction about the choice of fertility as the outcome
variable and why this is interesting/important. Please then also add something in the discussion
about this. From a Darwinian standpoint, we might be interested in numbers of children but can
we explain why earlier age at first birth is associated with nuclear families while lower fertility
comes with having grandmothers in the household?
Limitations:
Divorce might be rare (in some of these countries) but death is not. I appreciate that you cannot
help this and that this is a limitation, but that comment does not justify it. It might be better to say
that you somewhat make up for this by including only younger mothers in the analysis. Or drop
that sentence.
Minor points:
Title is clumsy and not quite accurate – it implies causality. Please change the ‘lowers a women’s
...’ to something denoting association.
Please give the name of the author(s) you are referring to and not just the reference number on
P6, line 45 and on P7, lines 25 and 36.
P8, paragraph starting at line 15. It sounds odd to talk about “joining the characteristics” of two
family members. Perhaps say that IPUMS has (and you have further) linked the data on these
individuals instead.

Comments to the Author(s)
In the first version of this ms the authors investigated the effect of grandparental co-residence on
female fertility in Austria and Vietnam. Now they have expanded their analyses to 14 countries
(and excluded the original two). In the first version they found that paternal grandmothers tend
to influence fertility more than their maternal counterparts. Now the results have changed. I still
believe that the main strength of the ms is that the authors utilise large-scale Census panel data.
Moreover, including 14 countries in the analyses may make a real contribution to the field
because authors can detect “more universal” trends compared to several prior studies. However,
I was unable to find a clear justification why it is important to use cross-country data. This should
be done in the introduction section. What new this brings to the field? What are the limitations of
using cross-country data? Overall, compared to the previous version, I think that the current
version is an improvement. However, I still think that the ms is not ready for publication. Below
you find some comments.

Summary
Line 25: ”…census data of 2,156,875 married women…” <U+2192> ”…census data of over two million
married women…”
Intro
You have chosen very different countries in your analyses. Please explain do you believe that the
effect should not vary between these countries? Why or why not? You should try to convince
readers that we really need a study based on cross-country analyses. Perhaps, you can cite to the
paper by Henrich et al. (2010, The weirdest people in the world. Behavioral and Brain Sciences,
33, 61–83).
Page 7, line 16: Authors state: ”Humans usually favour patrilocal female dispersal”. I am not
convinced that this is the case. In modern western societies (where women can choose where they
live) they do not usually live with their husbands’ kin. In contrast, women can favour their own
kin over their husband’s kin.
Discussion
I believe that you need try to provide a more comprehensive theoretical explanation for your
findings. Now critical reader (as myself) start to think that perhaps your findings are based on
data limitations (e.g., you were unable to restrict the analyses to 45+ women).
Tables
Why reference category for group “mother-in-law in hh” is “own mother in hh” rather than “no
mother in hh?”
Pages 17–18, Table 2 and 3: Does black text indicate un-significant positive/negative association?
Please clarify.

Comments to the Author(s)
Manuscript ”Living with own or husband’s mother in the household lowers a woman’s number
of children: a cross-cultural analysis” investigates important and interesting topic. The results are
also of interest, especially because they contrast the previous findings made by historical and
present day data that state that the presence of grandmothers may increase the fertility. Although
the study is interesting and conducted with large data, there are some substantial flaws that
should be met until the manuscript could be published.
My main concerns focus on methods and theoretical issues (which are partly connected).
Methods:
If I have understood correctly, data used is cross-sectional including women of varying ages.
Thus, the results presented are associations and show difference between individuals in certain
time point. In addition, the data apparently does not tell how long grandmothers have lived with
their daughters or daughters-in-law – just the situation at the time point of census. This in mind,
the authors should be careful to use terminology which refers to causality such in the title
“..lowers a woman fertility..”
18
Authors discuss (p. 12, lines 12-29) the possibility that in different SES groups the presence of
grandmothers may have different association with the number of children but they could have as
well tested this with their data. Interaction between e.g., mother’s/father’s education and the
presence of grandmother could show how the association between number of children and the
presence of gms differ in different socioeconomic groups.
Regarding this, the authors should include more discussion and some references as well about
resource competition or local resource competition hypothesis (e.g. Strassmann, 2011; Strassmann
& Garrard, 2011, there could be some newer papers on the topic as well). Authors start to discuss
this a bit at the end of the Discussion section but they could develop this topic further (especially
because their results seems to support the hypothesis of (local) resource competition).
In figure 1 (a, b, c) the smoothed curves should be in the same figure so they could be compared
to each other.
Theory:
There is important difference that the authors seem to miss, between investments, contact or
support from grandparents who do not live with their children and grandparents who co-reside
with their children (and grandchildren). In three generational households grandparents,
especially very old grandparents, can be more of a resource competitors than providers of help
and support.
Smaller issues:
Some relevant references are missing. In addition to abovementioned e.g., Lahdenperä et al. 2004
should be mentioned.
p. 6, line 45: “In his review, [12] comes to the overall conclusion…” needs a subject.

ew of the manuscript ID RSOS-160929 by Zahourek and Fieder, entitled „The effect of mothers-in-law on the
ber of grandchildren. A cross-cultural analysis between Austria and Vietnam”
authors investigate the impact of mothers as well as mothers-in-law on fertility. I think the research topic is
resting for the readership of Royal Society Open Science, but the paper is not ready for publication in its current
e since it suffers from a few substantial methodological as well as theoretical flaws.
nvited Dr. Huber to join the manuscript as first author, as she is experienced in the field.
Issues
authors leave the reader in the dark why specifically Austria and Vietnam were chosen as study populations
IPUMS international. This is surprising since IPUMS international includes several dozen other countries and
wonders why especially the comparison between Austria and Vietnam should be of great value to investigate
her and mother-in-law effects. The authors should justify their choice carefully (e.g., promising differentials in
sehold compositions, etc.) and further I am wondering whether the impact of the study could be improved if
e populations were included.
agree fully with the comment of the reviewer and so enlarged our sample substantially, now containing 14
us samples world-wide. We used the most recent census samples for all those countries where age of first
riage was recorded, which we used as a proxy to calculate the potential reproductive time span a women of a
ain age may have had. As the census data for Austria and Vietnam do not provide age at first marriage, these
countries are not included anymore in the analysis.
oretical Aspects
authors interpret their findings regarding the mother-in-law exclusively in the light of paternity uncertainty.
ough this explanation is widely used in the literature of evolutionary anthropology to explain the opposite
cts of mothers and mothers-in-law, there are several other explanations discussed in the literature that should
entioned and discussed in the paper. First, the paper would benefit from the theoretical differentiation
een mother and mother-in-law effects that are due to behavior (or social interactions in broader sense) and
e that are due to common causes (e.g. wealth, SES, household quality). For instance, in contemporary
ulations where extended families are less required for a higher standard of living, matri- as well as patrilocality
often associated with low SES, whereas neolocality could at least to some extent capture economic success. A
lar explanation could also explain the finding that biological mothers reduce fertility. Mothers who cohabit with
r parents might face a difficult and complicated stage of life (e.g., absence of husband, poor health,
mployment, etc.). Further, in addition to paternity uncertainty, there are other behavior-related reasons for
her-in-law effects. It has been argued that mothers-in-law might reproductively exploit their daughters-in-law
e they are genetically related to the children of their daughters-in-law, but not to them (Voland & Beise 2004).
perspective differs from the argument of paternity uncertainty since the mothers-in-law (all kin-in-law in
ral) are more interested in the well-being of their sons’ children, but less in the well-being of their daughters-
w. This might be especially true in patrilocal societies where the mother is cut off from her natal kin due to
ation in the household of her husband’s family. In the in-laws’ households, mothers are entirely dependent on
r husbands and their family. In relation to mothers who receive support from their natal kin, this circumstance
ht pose a major risk because a mother’s access to resources of the in-law-lineage is only ensured fragilely and

gonistic (positive) mother-in-law effects. As the authors noted, the risk of paternity uncertainty is reduced in a
ilocal population since the reproductive females are more or less guarded by the in-law-family. Under such
mstances the relationship between daughters- and mothers-in-law might be less conflict-laden. Also I am
dering to what extent intermarriage plays a role. In traditional populations marriages between cousins are
uent and in such marriages the mother-in-law is also a biological aunt.

Selection
worried about the authors’ method of handling the problem of incomplete reproduction. As far as I
erstand the models, age is included as a control variable. This variable tells little about since when the women
e married (had been exposed to the risk of legitimate child bearing). If possible the authors should investigate
mpact of mothers on age-specific fertility. This could also give insight how mothers-in-law are affecting fertility
shorter inter birth intervals, etc.)
uggested by the reviewer, we completely changed the selected samples to i) include a variety of samples from
rent cultures and regions in the analysis (in total now 14 samples) and ii) to include an estimate of the risk of
imate child bearing (we included the time span between age at first marriage and current age at the time of
census survey in all multivariate models). As mentioned above this was the limiting variable in choosing the
us samples.

for humans. In fact, in modern “free” societies where individuals have option to decide where they live,
ales do not tend to live closer to their husband’s kin than their own kin.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper has much improved, and I am pleased to see the
authors have done a broader multi-national study. I think this
paper is suitable for RSOS although I still think that it
could be more tightly pitched. The methods seem sound, and the
results interesting. I have little more to criticise but I do
think the introduction in particular could be more focussed
and a more convincing argument put forward to make the paper
really special.
Here are my comments:
The introduction gives a brief overview of the relevant
literature but it needs to be clearer about how this research
is filling a gap.
You talk of the value of grandparenting and you say a little
bit about post-marital dispersal but they seem to be quite
loosely thrown together.
We integrated the dispersal paragraph in the discussion
You mention that we know less about the lineage differences in
grandparents and that we know little about grandfathers and
fathers. But this is not enough in itself. I think the
introduction would be strengthened by emphasizing why we want
to know more about lineage differences, and you should tie the
various paragraphs together more tightly.
We reorganized the paragraphs to make to aim of the study more
clear
For instance, the paragraph starting at line 8 on page 7 comes
across as an afterthought and I think would make more sense to
(a) be fleshed out a bit more and (b) situated earlier among
the literature of the general benefits of grandparents.
We rearranged it
I realise that this might seem like a stylistic issue but for
this paper to be published in RSOS, it needs improved cohesion
and to exhibit confidence in what you are arguing.
Also, you wait until the last paragraph to mention that your
variable of interest is number of children. Please tell us why
you chose this outcome - you have not emphasised why fertility
in particular is something we are interested in understanding
with regard to grandparenting. (Bearing in mind lots of
literature looks at child survival and there is some on birth
spacing, and age at first birth.)
We clarified
Methods:
Please provide more descriptive statistics. At least provide
the distributions of each variable used. It is impossible to
make meaningful interpretations of the results without knowing
things about average education levels, mean age at marriage,
and especially, average fertility in each country sample.
We added descriptive statistics in the supplement (Tables S1-
S4)
Later on you say that women having own mother in the house had
fewer children. Can we see numbers for mean numbers of
children for each household setup please?
We included a table of mean number of children according to
household setup in the supplement (Table S5).
Also, only after seeing table 1 do I realise that each sample
is taken from a different time period. Can you please say more
about this, and more in general about the data and the
sampling (there seem to be pretty big differences in sample
size too)? Does the random factor for sample account for the
period differences as well as the country differences?
We included an overall sample description in the methods
section and a description for each sample in the supplemntary
tables (Methods, Table S6)
Results:
Table 2: why do you put ‘neg’ or ‘pos’ instead of the actual
coefficients? They would be much more informative. You could
still highlight the direction of the associations if you want
to emphasise this.
We included the actual coefficients
Table 3: (or in table 1) please include sample sizes for each
country.
We included sample size for each country in Table 1.
Figure 1: please label the y axis.
We labeled the Y- Axes in Figure 1 accordingly.
Discussion:
As you say in the first few paragraphs, there are likely to be
cross-nationally different explanations for the negative
effect of grandmothers on fertility. Given that these are co-
residing grandmothers (also most common in low-income
settings), the simplest explanation would be resource
competition. Regardless of whose mother it is, it is still
another mouth to feed. There is plenty in the literature on
this - please add some discussion of this interpretation.
We added this in the discussion
Further to your comments in the last part of the discussion;
co-residence is also a fairly rare thing in most of these
countries - are you able to test what predicts co-residence?
It might be useful to look at this phenomenon by age - younger
newly-weds live with their parents but older couples might
have the grandmothers live with them (say, after the
grandfather dies). I realise your sample is fairly young so
this might not be discernible with these data, but it is worth
mentioning.
We tested it (Results, supplement Table S13)
I recommended you say something in the introduction about the
choice of fertility as the outcome variable and why this is
interesting/important. Please then also add something in the
discussion about this. From a Darwinian standpoint, we might
be interested in numbers of children but can we explain why
earlier age at first birth is associated with nuclear families
while lower fertility comes with having grandmothers in the
household?
We added this
Limitations:
Divorce might be rare (in some of these countries) but death
is not. I appreciate that you cannot help this and that this
is a limitation, but that comment does not justify it. It
might be better to say that you somewhat make up for this by
including only younger mothers in the analysis. Or drop that
sentence.
We dropped the sentence
Minor points:
Title is clumsy and not quite accurate - it implies causality.
Please change the ‘lowers a women’s ...’ to something denoting
association.
We changed it
Please give the name of the author(s) you are referring to and
not just the reference number on P6, line 45 and on P7, lines
25 and 36.

Comments to the Author(s)
In the first version of this ms the authors investigated the
effect of grandparental co-residence on female fertility in
Austria and Vietnam. Now they have expanded their analyses to
14 countries (and excluded the original two). In the first
version they found that paternal grandmothers tend to
influence fertility more than their maternal counterparts. Now
the results have changed. I still believe that the main
strength of the ms is that the authors utilise large-scale
Census panel data. Moreover, including 14 countries in the
analyses may make a real contribution to the field because

several prior studies. However, I was unable to find a clear
justification why it is important to use cross-country data.
This should be done in the introduction section. What new this
brings to the field? What are the limitations of using cross-
country data? Overall, compared to the previous version, I
think that the current version is an improvement. However, I
still think that the ms is not ready for publication. Below
you find some comments.

Intro
You have chosen very different countries in your analyses.
Please explain do you believe that the effect should not vary
between these countries? Why or why not? You should try to
convince readers that we really need a study based on cross-
country analyses. Perhaps, you can cite to the paper by
Henrich et al. (2010, The weirdest people in the world.
Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 33, 61-83).
We included Henrich et al. and the problem of WIRED samples in

Discussion
I believe that you need try to provide a more comprehensive
theoretical explanation for your findings. Now critical reader
(as myself) start to think that perhaps your findings are
based on data limitations (e.g., you were unable to restrict
the analyses to 45+ women).

topic. The results are also of interest, especially because
they contrast the previous findings made by historical and
present day data that state that the presence of grandmothers
may increase the fertility. Although the study is interesting
and conducted with large data, there are some substantial
flaws that should be met until the manuscript could be
published.
My main concerns focus on methods and theoretical issues
(which are partly connected).
Methods:
If I have understood correctly, data used is cross-sectional
including women of varying ages. Thus, the results presented
are associations and show difference between individuals in
certain time point. In addition, the data apparently does not
tell how long grandmothers have lived with their daughters or
daughters-in-law - just the situation at the time point of
census. This in mind, the authors should be careful to use
terminology which refers to causality such in the title
‘‘ . . l o w e r s a w o m a n f e r t i l i t y . . ’’
we changed it
Authors discuss (p. 12, lines 12-29) the possibility that in
different SES groups the presence of grandmothers may have
different association with the number of children but they
could have as well tested this with their data. Interaction
between e.g., mother’s/father’s education and the presence of
grandmother could show how the association between number of
children and the presence of gms differ in different
socioeconomic groups.
We refrained from including this in the paper because due to
the many levels of the different factors the interactions are
hard, respectively impossible to interpret accurately.
Regarding this, the authors should include more discussion and
some references as well about resource competition or local
resource competition hypothesis (e.g. Strassmann, 2011;
Strassmann & Garrard, 2011, there could be some newer papers
on the topic as well). Authors start to discuss this a bit at
the end of the Discussion section but they could develop this
topic further (especially because their results seems to
support the hypothesis of (local) resource competition).
We included a paragraph in the discussion section (par 5)
In figure 1 (a, b, c) the smoothed curves should be in the
same figure so they could be compared to each other.
we changed it
Theory:
There is important difference that the authors seem to miss,
between investments, contact or support from grandparents who
do not live with their children and grandparents who co-reside
with their children (and grandchildren). In three generational
households grandparents, especially very old grandparents, can
be more of a resource competitors than providers of help and
support.
We discussed this (discussion par 5)
Smaller issues:
Some relevant references are missing. In addition to
abovementioned e.g., Lahdenperä et al. 2004 should be
mentioned.

Authors have done good job addressing the concerns I brought up in my review and I think this
evised version is improvement. I have few small issues that I would like the Authors to pay
attention.
p. 14 line 195-196 the sentence: "We have no evidence that living alone as a couple has always been
he most common living arrangement." is a bit hard to follow. If you refer to your own results and
data, how can you state that you do not have any evidence from previous societies (which I interpret
always" here to refer to)? I suggest some reformulating for this sentence. Also the end of the same
paragraph is difficult to follow.
