I found this a clear and useful paper, relating locus of control to smoking and alcohol use. I have
a few comments that need clarification and some minor suggestions.
Main comments:
- I think the rationale for using this prospective design could be made more clear (at P5 L12).
Why is specifically this link of interest?
- Why was it specifically necessary to dichotomize the left-skewed FTND? This seems quite
extreme. Were the results strongly dependent on this analysis step?
- I'm afraid I didn't understand how age could be used as a confounder (P6 L 44), given that age is
already built in to the prospective design?
- Was there no more recent measure of IQ or executive functioning than the WISC-III at age 8?
Minor comments:
- P4, L4: The first comma seems unnecessary, and a "dearth" seems a little overstated given the
following paragraph.
- P4, L36: Please explain what the relevant limitation of a cross-sectional design is.
- P7, L16: Capitalization of "model".
- Please provide a reference in the sentence on external locus of control, P10 L 4.
- Final sentence: I think it would be more correct to say "...could develop..."
- The idea of interventions is interesting but not very developed. Maybe more out of possible
interest to the authors, they might consider looking at the Cognitive Bias Modification literature.

The present paper uses data from the ALSPAC study to examine linkages between locus of
control in adolescence, and subsequent tobacco and alcohol use. The results suggest that there
were relatively weak but discernable associations between an externally-focussed locus of control
at age 16, and subsequent smoking, and a somewhat less robust association between an external
locus of control and hazardous drinking (significant at age 17 but not at age 21).
This is an interesting paper that investigates the possible role of a very old construct in
psychology in an epidemiological format. I have the following general comments to make:
1. Because the associations are relatively weak (increase in odds for smoking were 14% to 18%,
and for hazardous drinking 9% and 1%), these may be particularly vulnerable to unmeasured
confounding. However, it's not at all clear what unmeasured factors could confound these
associations. From our own longitudinal research, three possibilities come to mind: childhood
behaviour problems (conduct problems; attention problems), exposure to abuse/neglect, and
family instability. I don't know whether any of these are significantly associated with the
predictor (locus of control), but it seems reasonable to expect that they might be. Do the authors
have any data concerning these factors? Are they associated with LoC? If so, it would be helpful
to consider these as possible confounders.
2. The authors mention that it is not clear what mechanism links LoC to substance use behaviour.
One possibility that springs to mind is life stress. It might be possible, for example, to set up a
mediation model in which LoC at 16 predicts life stress (if measured, of course) at 17 or 21, to
account for a possible mediating pathway. If the authors had such data available, it would add
value to this analysis.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
We thank the reviewers for their comments and the thorough analysis of the
manuscript. Please find below a list of all the changes made.
REVIEWERS’ COMMENTS:
Reviewer #1
- I think the rationale for using this prospective design could be made more clear
(at P5 L12). Why is specifically this link of interest?
We have added a sentence ‘The clear temporal ordering of exposure, outcomes and
confounders helps to rule out the possibility of reverse causation’ and rephrased the
following paragraph to stress the importance of using a stable LoC measure that
preceded the smoking and alcohol consumption measures. In addition, using data
from a prospective design allowed us to test the association between LoC and
smoking and alcohol consumption both at age 17 years, and later on, at 21 years.
- Why was it specifically necessary to dichotomize the left-skewed FTND? This
seems quite extreme. Were the results strongly dependent on this analysis step?
We were interested in examining non-trivial levels of substance use, therefore we
used a binary (hazardous vs non-hazardous) outcome for alcohol consumption too.
To this end, in both cases the cutoff points used in this study are commonly used.
We have changed the wording in the text to avoid confusion, as follows:
‘Nicotine dependence (ND) was measured at the same ages in daily smokers using
the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). The total possible score
ranged from 0 to 10. As we were interested in examining nicotine dependence, a
binary variable (0/1) was created (=4) indicating moderate to high levels of nicotine
dependence (40).’
- I'm afraid I didn't understand how age could be used as a confounder (P6 L 44),
given that age is already built in to the prospective design?
We included age because clinics were run across several months. For example, the
mean age of the ALSPAC participants for the 17-years-clinics was 17.8 years, SD =
0.4.
- Was there no more recent measure of IQ or executive functioning than the WISC-
III at age 8?
We used IQ at 8 years to ensure that this measure could not be the affected by
smoking or drinking, thus helping to rule out the possibility of reverse causation.
- P4, L4: The first comma seems unnecessary, and a "dearth" seems a little
overstated given the following paragraph.
We have changed ‘…dearth of research’ to ‘little research’.
- P4, L36: Please explain what the relevant limitation of a cross-sectional design is.
We have added that cross-sectional studies do not allow to analyse behaviour over
a period of time.
- P7, L16: Capitalization of "model".
We have capitalized the ‘m’.
- Please provide a reference in the sentence on external locus of control, P10 L 4.
We have added the reference.
- Final sentence: I think it would be more correct to say "...could develop..."
We have amended accordingly.
- The idea of interventions is interesting but not very developed. Maybe more out
of possible interest to the authors, they might consider looking at the Cognitive
Bias Modification literature.
We have added the following paragraph to include the value of addressing cognitive
biases in an intervention aimed at increasing perception of control:
‘In addition, since LoC is the perception of one’s control over life events, it is
reasonable to consider that such perception can be influenced by biased
information processing, that is, by cognitive biases (Jones and Sharpe, 2017). By
targeting eventual distorted selectivity in perceiving and elaborating information of
one’s experiences and preferences, LoC orientation could be steered towards a
perception of control.’
Reviewer #2
1. Because the associations are relatively weak (increase in odds for smoking
were 14% to 18%, and for hazardous drinking 9% and 1%), these may be
particularly vulnerable to unmeasured confounding. However, it's not at all clear
what unmeasured factors could confound these associations. From our own
longitudinal research, three possibilities come to mind: childhood behaviour
problems (conduct problems; attention problems), exposure to abuse/neglect,
and family instability. I don't know whether any of these are significantly
associated with the predictor (locus of control), but it seems reasonable to expect
that they might be. Do the authors have any data concerning these factors? Are
they associated with LoC? If so, it would be helpful to consider these as possible
confounders.
We have tested the association between LoC and adverse childhood experiences
(using a cumulative measure derived for 0-16 years-
see https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/3-106/v1) as well as between LoC
and conduct disorder (reported by the mother using the strengths and difficulties
questionnaire at age 13). We then repeated the analyses including adverse
childhood experiences and conduct disorder as confounders. We obtained
consistent results with the results reported in the main text (figures 1-2 and SM). In
particular, there was evidence that a more external LoC at age 16 was associated
with being at least a weekly smoker at age 17 (N = 832; OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02, 1.25, P
= 0.02) and age 21 (N = 819; OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00, 1.22, P = 0.05). Having a more
external LoC at age 16 was also associated with nicotine dependence at age 17 (N =
69; OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.48, P = 0.01), and age 21 (N = 78; OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.84
to 1.95, P = 0.02). A more external LoC at age 16 was associated with higher odds of
hazardous drinking on the AUDIT score at age 17 (N = 1105; OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to
1.16, P < 0.03) but not at age 21 (N = 1105; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08, P = 0.91).
We have not included these analyses in the manuscript because the small sample
size available means the estimates are imprecise, but we would be happy to include
them if requested.
2. The authors mention that it is not clear what mechanism links LoC to substance
use behaviour. One possibility that springs to mind is life stress. It might be
possible, for example, to set up a mediation model in which LoC at 16 predicts life
stress (if measured, of course) at 17 or 21, to account for a possible mediating
pathway. If the authors had such data available, it would add value to this
analysis.
We thank the reviewer for a very interesting point. Indeed, a number of studies (for
examples: Parkay et al., 1988; Anderson et al., 1977, Bollini et al., 2004), have
reported that stress is positively correlated with external LoC and, individuals with
more external LoC are more responsive to stress and showed a higher cortisol
response. Stress in turn has a complex relationship with nicotine and alcohol
consumption; intake of both substances causes stress-like cortisol responses
(Lovello 2006).
Subjective reports and biological indices of stress have been implicated in the
aetiology of numerous psychological and physical illnesses, including substance
addiction. For this reason, we agree that further studies are needed to examine
psychological and biological mechanisms that are pivotal in the relationship
between LoC, stress and nicotine and alcohol consumption.
We believe that conducting an analysis to include life stress would be an interesting
approach, however this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. To our knowledge
this current study is the largest and most robust study to date to assess the
prospective association between LoC and later assessments of tobacco smoking and
alcohol use. We here report, using a large prospective birth cohort which allows for
the clear temporal ordering of the variables, further evidence that an external LoC is
associated with increased tobacco and alcohol use during adolescence.
Nevertheless, selecting participants from ALSPAC that have a LoC measure, a
nicotine and alcohol consumption measure as well as the ‘Life events measure’
would result in a loss of power by further reducing the sample size. An ad hoc
experiment, looking at both the psychological and biological mechanisms that links
LoC to stress and then to nicotine and alcohol consumption, would better fit the
purpose.
We have added the following sentence in the limitations section:
‘Further studies could investigate whether other variables, such as life stress, may
account for a possible mediating pathway between LoC and substance use.’
