Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This paper is a nice analysis of zooxanthellate coral (Z-coral) biogeography using Ecological
Niche Modelling (ENM). We like the author’s use of the ENM to assess the completeness of the
fossil record as well as their future predictions. It is clear that this manuscript has already been
through several rounds of revision and so should be accepted once a few additional things are
addressed.
Moderate/Major Issues
1. “Modern” baselines. What do you define as “modern”? Is it present data (i.e., 2018/2019), data
from the preindustrial era, or some other time? This might seem like splitting hairs, but the
climate (and thus environment) is changing so fast that coral reef distribution may not be
representative of current settings, but rather the averages from 20 years ago, or 100 years ago. It
should be explicitly stated in the methods what you mean by “modern” and better yet, would be
to see if your ENM data change significantly (or are at least different) if you use 2018 data vs.
2000 data vs. pre-industrial data. These results would be interesting in their own rights and
would be a good test for a) the sensitivity of the ENM to input data and b) the shifting baselines
that reefs are currently subjected to. If this has already been tested sufficiently by other groups, it
would also be ok to just cite those works.
2. Saturation State. Other reviewers have already pointed this issue out, but we still do not feel it
has been properly addressed. The authors themselves state (correctly) that SST is the primary
control on Z-coral reefs, but that light availability, saturation state (O), salinity and nutrient
levels are also important (lines 144-147). Yes, they are “secondary factors” and thus not AS
important as SST, but as the ENM shows, several of these factors are still important
environmental variables (lines 138-140). While it is understood that saturation state is not
recorded directly in the fossil record, most of the variables are generated by a climate model
anyway. At the very least it would be good to incorporate modern saturation states to see if they
influence the ENM. Feely et al., 2009 (https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2009.95) have done a nice
job of reconstructing modern, pre-industrial, and future saturation states that could be used (and
there are probably better models that have come out in the last decade). If this test shows that O
values do not change the ENM, then they can ignore it for the past… but if they change, then the
authors should at least highlight that this is an unknown parameter that should be included in
future models, especially since many GCMs are not including carbonate chemistry.
3. Ecological variables. Many of the ecological variables discussed are quite variable within a
1.25° x 1.25° grid cell (e.g., depth or salinity can change dramatically on a shelf edge reef vs.
lagoonal reef). These factors can have significant effects on a reef ecosystem. At the very least, the
authors should note that this local variability will not be captured by their ENM and would be
significant. Better yet would be to do the ENM at a higher resolution for some significant regions
(e.g., the coral triangle), but the model or computing power may be limited. Also, what about
seasonality or temperature extremes? Some papers have shown that temperature extremes might
be linked with adaptability (e.g., Palumbi et al., 2014; DOI: 10.1126/science.1251336).

Minor issues:
• There were too many acronyms (especially similar acronyms) and this often made the text
difficult to understand. Please remove unnecessary acronyms (e.g., LBG, LHG), leaving only the
common, or highly used ones (e.g., SST, DEM, LIG). A good general rule is to limit acronyms to
~3 – 5 in a paper/grant).
• Throughout the text there are places where comparative adjectives are used (e.g., “larger” in
line 245, “more favorable” in line 261, etc.) but there is only one thing in the sentence. Please go
through the text and make sure that if you are using a comparative adjective to compare 2 things,
it is clear what both of those things are (i.e., larger than what?).
• Line 15-17: The last interglacial is not the fossil record. We suggest rephrasing to:
“The paleontological record from the Last Interglacial (LIG; 125,000 years ago), a time of global
warming, suggests that reef corals experienced poleward range shifts and an equatorial decline
relative to their modern distribution.”
• Line 70: missing punctuation in the brackets
• Line 84: Please define what is meant by “ecotype-level”. It is good to be explicit in the methods
section.
• Lines 95-97: Suggest you include an explicit statement saying that the zooxanthellate
characteristics are assumed to be the same as the modern for the fossil coral taxa (obvious yes, but
an assumption nonetheless). For example: Kiessling and Kocsis 2015, doi: 10.1017/pab.2015.6 ;
Swain et al 2018, doi: 10.3354/meps12445)
• Line 133: saturation state/alkalinity, etc. are also limiting factors.
• Line 186: semicolon not needed
• Line 305: What might explain the equatorial decline? If not the factors analyzed in the ENM,
might there be something else?
• Lines 315-316: It would also be good to mention that stressed coral reef ecosystems are a lot less
likely to survive other stressors, such as pollution, overfishing etc.
• Line 338: Please define/explain Variable Contribution analysis (or provide a citation)
• Lines 338-341: Bathymetric variability should also be discussed here, either in terms of the lack
of ENM resolution and the tectonic changes that have occurred; i.e., LIG bathymetry is generally
similar to modern bathymetry, but many places (e.g., Jamaca or Vanuatu) have experienced non-
trivial uplift due to tectonics.
• Line 389: replace “(i.e. absence)” with “(i.e. absence of reported fossil collections/occurrences)”
• Line 406: Suggest adding “anthropogenic” before “environmental impacts”
Figure Edits
*Please make the below corrections in the supplemental material as well.
• Fig. 1: Please define “Occ.” In the figure caption.

• Figs. 1 & 2: Define the dashed lines and greyed area in the plots (presumably it is the
tropics/equator but the reader should not need to guess).
• Fig. 2: Please define what the binary thresholds in the caption mean as well as the different
scenarios (i.e., LIG, RCP4.5). Figures should be able to stand alone.
• Fig. 3: These plots are definitely difficult to read, the blue should be lightened… it is almost
impossible to distinguish blue cells from black cells unless you’re in perfect lighting conditions.
It’s great that you have checked for colorblindness, but it just looks like some yellow and grey
dots in black squares to someone of normal vision. Since this is the second time a reviewer has
highlighted issue, you should change the colors.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this paper, the authors use modern and paleontological (Last interglacial [LIG]) occurrence
data to niche model the distributions of reef corals. Using these niche models, they then predict
the response to two future climate scenarios. The goal of this paper is to predict how corals will
respond to future climate change. A model of coral distributions is needed in order to make this
prediction. And the authors use fossil and modern distributions to train their model.
The paper has three stated goals:
“Here, we use ENM to: (1) evaluate the extent to which the LIG equatorial decline of reef corals is
the result of fossil bias or a genuine loss in habitability; (2) quantify the variation in geographic
range of reef corals during the LIG and under future climate scenarios, with implications for
understanding the evolution of the reef coral latitudinal biodiversity gradient; and (3)
5
demonstrate the value of utilising fossil reef coral data to improve biodiversity risk assessment
through consideration of the realised niche under varied climate states.”
All of these goals address important questions. As far as I know, goal 2 and 3 are novel and this
paper provides important results. Goal 1 was previously explored by Kiessling et al (2012) [which
I was a coauthor].
All in all, I think that, although this paper tackles an important issue, it does not meet its potential
because it is confusing. The focus on occurrences and ENM methods and not the questions posed
is a big part of this confusion for me. Take for example, the LIG and modern diversity gradients.
Although these are major parts of the the paper (goals 1 and 2), no where is diversity shown, only
numbers of occurrences and numbers of habitable cells.
Major comments:
I understand the motive for studying the relationships between coral distributions and climate. I
don’t think a convincing case for using niche models is made in the introduction. No doubt there
are sampling issues with the past that cannot be fully ameliorated by sub-sampling. But framing
the current paper as a methodological correction to Kiessling et al limits the current paper’s
appeal and impact. ENM are needed for a much more important reason than correcting
Kiessling—a niche model is necessary for the forward prediction into future climate scenarios.
I suggest adding in a paragraph into the introduction, at about line 73, to point out that there is
no other way to make a prediction into the future than with a well trained model. Adding in
fossil occurrences from the last interglacial, when the earth was warmer than today, aids in the
modeling effort because modern occurrences alone sample a small range of possible climatic
variation. More sampled variation in temperatures and occurrences will lead to a higher fidelity
model.
Geographic ranges surely are species specific, therefore I can’t see how lumping occurrences of all
coral species together can say anything about the range shifts from LIG to the modern. However,
those ENMs are the only option for predicting the coral occurrences in the future. Would species
specific ENMs be too noisy?
I find understanding Figure 2 to be confusing. There are many combinations of training dataset
and modeled pattern that are hard to tease apart. For one, I’m surprised that the modern-trained
modern habitability is so different from the observed modern occurrences. The peak habitability
in the southern hemisphere is 5 or more degrees off of the peak occurrences in the raw data. This
mismatch makes me wonder if the number of habitable cells is informative for diversity. What is
the pattern of latitudinal diversity in this dataset anyway?

This paper is a nice analysis of zooxanthellate coral (Z-coral) biogeography using Ecological
Niche Modelling (ENM). We like the author’s use of the ENM to assess the completeness of the
fossil record as well as their future predictions. It is clear that this manuscript has already been
through several rounds of revision and so should be accepted once a few additional things are
addressed.
Moderate/Major Issues
1. “Modern” baselines. What do you define as “modern”? Is it present data (i.e., 2018/2019), data
from the preindustrial era, or some other time? This might seem like splitting hairs, but the
9

Comments to the Author(s)
In this paper, the authors use modern and paleontological (Last interglacial [LIG]) occurrence
data to niche model the distributions of reef corals. Using these niche models, they then predict
the response to two future climate scenarios. The goal of this paper is to predict how corals will
11
respond to future climate change. A model of coral distributions is needed in order to make this
prediction. And the authors use fossil and modern distributions to train their model.
The paper has three stated goals:
“Here, we use ENM to: (1) evaluate the extent to which the LIG equatorial decline of reef corals is
the result of fossil bias or a genuine loss in habitability; (2) quantify the variation in geographic
range of reef corals during the LIG and under future climate scenarios, with implications for
understanding the evolution of the reef coral latitudinal biodiversity gradient; and (3)
demonstrate the value of utilising fossil reef coral data to improve biodiversity risk assessment
through consideration of the realised niche under varied climate states.”
All of these goals address important questions. As far as I know, goal 2 and 3 are novel and this
paper provides important results. Goal 1 was previously explored by Kiessling et al (2012) [which
I was a coauthor].
All in all, I think that, although this paper tackles an important issue, it does not meet its potential
because it is confusing. The focus on occurrences and ENM methods and not the questions posed
is a big part of this confusion for me. Take for example, the LIG and modern diversity gradients.
Although these are major parts of the the paper (goals 1 and 2), no where is diversity shown, only
numbers of occurrences and numbers of habitable cells.
Major comments:
I understand the motive for studying the relationships between coral distributions and climate. I
don’t think a convincing case for using niche models is made in the introduction. No doubt there
are sampling issues with the past that cannot be fully ameliorated by sub-sampling. But framing
the current paper as a methodological correction to Kiessling et al limits the current paper’s

fossil occurrences from the last interglacial, when the earth was warmer than today, aids in the

variation. More sampled variation in temperatures and occurrences will lead to a higher fidelity
model.
Geographic ranges surely are species specific, therefore I can’t see how lumping occurrences of all
coral species together can say anything about the range shifts from LIG to the modern. However,
those ENMs are the only option for predicting the coral occurrences in the future. Would species
specific ENMs be too noisy?
I find understanding Figure 2 to be confusing. There are many combinations of training dataset
and modeled pattern that are hard to tease apart. For one, I’m surprised that the modern-trained
modern habitability is so different from the observed modern occurrences. The peak habitability
in the southern hemisphere is 5 or more degrees off of the peak occurrences in the raw data. This
mismatch makes me wonder if the number of habitable cells is informative for diversity. What is
the pattern of latitudinal diversity in this dataset anyway?

Comments to the Author:
The manuscript has now been thoroughly reviewed and the reviewers have made a number of
important points that, if addressed, will significantly improve the impact of the eventual published
version. I agree with all the comments and suggestions made by the reviewers and encourage the
authors to consider them carefully.
First of all, we would like to thank the associate editor for their involvement with this
manuscript. We hope that our responses below satisfy their concerns, as well as those of
the reviewers.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
To begin with, we would like to thank reviewer 1 for their time, constructive criticism and clear
efforts to improve this manuscript. We have taken their comments wholeheartedly on board and
have made several amendments to our work based on their insight. Please see details below.
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper is a nice analysis of zooxanthellate coral (Z-coral) biogeography using Ecological Niche
Modelling (ENM). We like the author’s use of the ENM to assess the completeness of the fossil record
as well as their future predictions. It is clear that this manuscript has already been through several
rounds of revision and so should be accepted once a few additional things are addressed.
Moderate/Major Issues
1. “Modern” baselines. What do you define as “modern”? Is it present data (i.e., 2018/2019),
data from the preindustrial era, or some other time? This might seem like splitting hairs, but the climate
(and thus environment) is changing so fast that coral reef distribution may not be representative of
current settings, but rather the averages from 20 years ago, or 100 years ago. It should be explicitly
stated in the methods what you mean by “modern” and better yet, would be to see if your ENM data
change significantly (or are at least different) if you use 2018 data vs. 2000 data vs. pre-industrial data.
These results would be interesting in their own rights and would be a good test for a) the sensitivity of
the ENM to input data and b) the shifting baselines that reefs are currently subjected to. If this has
already been tested sufficiently by other groups, it would also be ok to just cite those works.
We have adjusted our text accordingly to specify that the modern data is of pre-industrial climate
conditions. Whilst we agree with the reviewers that it would be interesting to essentially use a time-
calibrated ENM, this would be a study or perhaps even two in its own right. It would require filtering
all occurrences to specific collection times and relating it to climatological means for that date. This
would be a substantial undertaking and is not within the scope of this particular study. What we
have done here is use pre-industrial climate conditions as it represents the long-term climate which
resulted into the biogeographic pattern we observe today.
2. Saturation State. Other reviewers have already pointed this issue out, but we still do not feel
it has been properly addressed. The authors themselves state (correctly) that SST is the primary control
on Z-coral reefs, but that light availability, saturation state (O), salinity and nutrient levels are also
important (lines 144-147). Yes, they are “secondary factors” and thus not AS important as SST, but as
the ENM shows, several of these factors are still important environmental variables (lines 138-140).
While it is understood that saturation state is not recorded directly in the fossil record, most of the
variables are generated by a climate model anyway. At the very least it would be good to incorporate
modern saturation states to see if they influence the ENM. Feely et al., 2009
(https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2009.95) have done a nice job of reconstructing modern, pre-
industrial, and future saturation states that could be used (and there are probably better models that
have come out in the last decade). If this test shows that O values do not change the ENM, then they
can ignore it for the past… but if they change, then the authors should at least highlight that this is an
unknown parameter that should be included in future models, especially since many GCMs are not
including carbonate chemistry.
To address this issue we have now generated a modern-trained ENM with aragonite saturation state
(O) included. As a sensitivity test we generated difference maps of the geographic projections for
the modern from ENMs with and without O included. We also ran variable contribution tests to see
the importance of O in our ENMs. We found that at a global scale, predictions are essentially the
same, however, there are some differences at a few isolated coastlines. In terms of variable
contribution, our analyses confirms that O is indeed of secondary significance, with similar
contributions to the ENM as irradiance variables. As the reviewer notes and our results confirm,
although O may not be as important as bathymetry and sea surface temperature, it is not
insignificant. Throughout the MS we have now tailored the text so it is in line with these results.
3. Ecological variables. Many of the ecological variables discussed are quite variable within a
1.25° x 1.25° grid cell (e.g., depth or salinity can change dramatically on a shelf edge reef vs. lagoonal
reef). These factors can have significant effects on a reef ecosystem. At the very least, the authors
should note that this local variability will not be captured by their ENM and would be significant. Better
yet would be to do the ENM at a higher resolution for some significant regions (e.g., the coral triangle),
but the model or computing power may be limited. Also, what about seasonality or temperature
extremes? Some papers have shown that temperature extremes might be linked with adaptability
(e.g., Palumbi et al., 2014; DOI: 10.1126/science.1251336).
We raise this issue in Supplementary Material 2 (first paragraph), particularly in regards to salinity.
However, we have added an additional couple of lines expanding on this. Whilst we agree with the
reviewer that it may have significant impacts at localised scales, the spatial scale needed to capture
such impacts would be on the scale of metres, opposed to kilometres. Unfortunately, this level of
resolution for environmental data at a global scale is simply not available at this time. There are
several works using remotely operated vehicles to capture data at this resolution (particularly on
cold-water corals), but as far as we are aware, these usually focus on localised transects. We hope
to see higher-resolution data from general circulation models in the future which can accurately
account for climate at higher resolution. However, it should also be considered that there may be a
higher level of uncertainty associated with future or past climate predictions at such resolutions,
and available computing power is restricted. In regards to the last point concerning acclimatization,
it is correct that the historical climate experience of some reef coral populations makes them more
adaptable to temperature extremes (even within the same species). However, our models treat reef
corals as a single entity (ecotype), and whilst we could introduce seasonal variables into our models,
it might have significant impacts on any model projections to other time-slices due to overfitting
and multicollinearity. A mechanistic ENM approach would be much more beneficial for the type of
analyses reviewer 1 is suggesting, rather than a correlative one.
Minor issues:
• There were too many acronyms (especially similar acronyms) and this often made the text
difficult to understand. Please remove unnecessary acronyms (e.g., LBG, LHG), leaving only the
common, or highly used ones (e.g., SST, DEM, LIG). A good general rule is to limit acronyms to ~3 – 5
in a paper/grant).
We have taken the reviewers concern on board and removed both the acronyms LBG and LHG.
• Throughout the text there are places where comparative adjectives are used (e.g., “larger” in
line 245, “more favorable” in line 261, etc.) but there is only one thing in the sentence. Please go
through the text and make sure that if you are using a comparative adjective to compare 2 things, it is
clear what both of those things are (i.e., larger than what?).
Amended, thank you.
• Line 15-17: The last interglacial is not the fossil record. We suggest rephrasing to:
“The paleontological record from the Last Interglacial (LIG; 125,000 years ago), a time of global
warming, suggests that reef corals experienced poleward range shifts and an equatorial decline
relative to their modern distribution.”
Amended, thank you for the suggestion.
• Line 70: missing punctuation in the brackets
Amended, thank you.
• Line 84: Please define what is meant by “ecotype-level”. It is good to be explicit in the methods
section.
Added.
• Lines 95-97: Suggest you include an explicit statement saying that the zooxanthellate
characteristics are assumed to be the same as the modern for the fossil coral taxa (obvious yes, but an
assumption nonetheless). For example: Kiessling and Kocsis 2015, doi: 10.1017/pab.2015.6 ; Swain et
al 2018, doi: 10.3354/meps12445)
We have added the following statement within this paragraph “Assignment of zooxanthellate class
focused on the principle of uniformitarianism for fossil coral taxa.”
• Line 133: saturation state/alkalinity, etc. are also limiting factors.
Whilst we agree, we are specifically referring to those variables that can be determined for the fossil
record from currently available GCM outputs (second half of the sentence).
• Line 186: semicolon not needed
Removed, thank you.
• Line 305: What might explain the equatorial decline? If not the factors analyzed in the ENM,
might there be something else?
We have added: “This suggests that the observed equatorial decline in the fossil record might be a
result of sampling bias within equatorial regions.”
• Lines 315-316: It would also be good to mention that stressed coral reef ecosystems are a lot
less likely to survive other stressors, such as pollution, overfishing etc.
Thank you for raising this important point. We have added: “Nevertheless, it should also be borne
in mind that reef corals, and coral reef ecosystems, are far less likely to survive other stressors, such
as overfishing and pollution, when residing in marginal habitats. “
• Line 338: Please define/explain Variable Contribution analysis (or provide a citation)
Added computed within biomod2 and citation for reference.
• Lines 338-341: Bathymetric variability should also be discussed here, either in terms of the lack
of ENM resolution and the tectonic changes that have occurred; i.e., LIG bathymetry is generally similar
to modern bathymetry, but many places (e.g., Jamaca or Vanuatu) have experienced non-trivial uplift
due to tectonics.
Added two sentences within the paragraph on this matter: “Whilst LIG bathymetry is generally
similar to that of the modern at a global scale, several areas have experienced localised tectonic
uplift (e.g. Huon Peninsula, Barbados, Sumba and Vanuatu (McCulloch and Esat, 2000)). However,
this is not likely to impact our results, based on our sea-level sensitivity test (see supplementary
material 2).”
• Line 389: replace “(i.e. absence)” with “(i.e. absence of reported fossil
collections/occurrences)”
Amended.
• Line 406: Suggest adding “anthropogenic” before “environmental impacts”
Amended.
Figure Edits
*Please make the below corrections in the supplemental material as well.
• Fig. 1: Please define “Occ.” In the figure caption.
Implemented.
• Figs. 1 & 2: Define the dashed lines and greyed area in the plots (presumably it is the
tropics/equator but the reader should not need to guess).
Implemented.
• Fig. 2: Please define what the binary thresholds in the caption mean as well as the different
scenarios (i.e., LIG, RCP4.5). Figures should be able to stand alone.
Implemented.
• Fig. 3: These plots are definitely difficult to read, the blue should be lightened… it is almost
impossible to distinguish blue cells from black cells unless you’re in perfect lighting conditions. It’s great
that you have checked for colorblindness, but it just looks like some yellow and grey dots in black
squares to someone of normal vision. Since this is the second time a reviewer has highlighted issue,
you should change the colors.
Implemented.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In this paper, the authors use modern and paleontological (Last interglacial [LIG]) occurrence data to
niche model the distributions of reef corals. Using these niche models, they then predict the response
to two future climate scenarios. The goal of this paper is to predict how corals will respond to future
climate change. A model of coral distributions is needed in order to make this prediction. And the
authors use fossil and modern distributions to train their model.
To begin with, we would like to thank reviewer 2 for their time, constructive criticism and clear
efforts to improve this manuscript. We have taken their comments wholeheartedly on board and
have made several amendments to our work based on their insight. Please see details below.
The paper has three stated goals:
“Here, we use ENM to: (1) evaluate the extent to which the LIG equatorial decline of reef corals is the
result of fossil bias or a genuine loss in habitability; (2) quantify the variation in geographic range of
reef corals during the LIG and under future climate scenarios, with implications for understanding the
evolution of the reef coral latitudinal biodiversity gradient; and (3) demonstrate the value of utilising
fossil reef coral data to improve biodiversity risk assessment through consideration of the realised
niche under varied climate states.”
All of these goals address important questions. As far as I know, goal 2 and 3 are novel and this paper
provides important results. Goal 1 was previously explored by Kiessling et al (2012) [which I was a
coauthor].
All in all, I think that, although this paper tackles an important issue, it does not meet its potential
because it is confusing. The focus on occurrences and ENM methods and not the questions posed is a
big part of this confusion for me. Take for example, the LIG and modern diversity gradients. Although
these are major parts of the the paper (goals 1 and 2), no where is diversity shown, only numbers of
occurrences and numbers of habitable cells.
We actually show sample in bin diversity within Figure 1. The first aim refers to using ecological
niche modelling to predict where we should or should not have fossil occurrences based on
predicted habitability (not so much diversity). In regards to the second aim, we are simply using
ecological niche modelling to show similarities between modern and LIG latitudinal habitability, and
what this could suggest for the latitudinal biodiversity gradient during the LIG, and under future
climatic conditions. Ecological niche modelling is not a tool for predicting biodiversity, but the
distribution of habitable localities. Rationally, we can make some inferences on the impact of
change in habitability for biodiversity, but not quantify how many of species x or y we should have.
Major comments:
I understand the motive for studying the relationships between coral distributions and climate. I don’t
think a convincing case for using niche models is made in the introduction. No doubt there are sampling
issues with the past that cannot be fully ameliorated by sub-sampling. But framing the current paper
as a methodological correction to Kiessling et al limits the current paper’s appeal and impact. ENM are
needed for a much more important reason than correcting Kiessling—a niche model is necessary for
the forward prediction into future climate scenarios.
We don’t feel this is a fair comment. This paper does not set out to correct Kiessling et al. (2012),
but compliment it. For example, we concurthat there was a higher diversity at higher latitudes
during the LIG. However, the combination of predicted habitability at equatorial latitudes during
the LIG and the known sampling bias within tropical latitudes, suggests the equatorial decline might
be artificial. We have added a couple of sentences to the introduction (relating to the next point) to
bolster the need for niche models as highlighted in this comment.
I suggest adding in a paragraph into the introduction, at about line 73, to point out that there is no
other way to make a prediction into the future than with a well trained model. Adding in fossil
occurrences from the last interglacial, when the earth was warmer than today, aids in the modeling
effort because modern occurrences alone sample a small range of possible climatic variation. More
sampled variation in temperatures and occurrences will lead to a higher fidelity model.
We have added “Future projections trained solely on modern-occurrences may underestimate
habitability due a restricted range in possible climatic variation. Through incorporation of the fossil
record this variation is increased, and might improve future projections by reducing the amount of
novel climate conditions faced from a modern-only trained model.”
Geographic ranges surely are species specific, therefore I can’t see how lumping occurrences of all coral
species together can say anything about the range shifts from LIG to the modern. However, those ENMs
are the only option for predicting the coral occurrences in the future. Would species specific ENMs be
too noisy?
Our study is not species specific, but at ecotype-level as we specify in the methods. Running this
type of global analysis at species-level would require higher resolution environmental data and
fairer sampling between different species to achieve meaningful predictions based on a correlative
approach. It is also worth mentioning that within different populations of the same species you may
have different environmental tolerances due to historical experience (e.g. thermal regimes; Howells
et al. (2013)), which ought to be considered if focusing efforts at species-level, at which point
mechanistic models may prove more fruitful. In this paper we are not looking at specific geographic
ranges sizes of species but the range size of suitable habitats.
I find understanding Figure 2 to be confusing. There are many combinations of training dataset and
modeled pattern that are hard to tease apart. For one, I’m surprised that the modern-trained modern
habitability is so different from the observed modern occurrences. The peak habitability in the southern
hemisphere is 5 or more degrees off of the peak occurrences in the raw data. This mismatch makes me
wonder if the number of habitable cells is informative for diversity. What is the pattern of latitudinal
diversity in this dataset anyway?
Within this figure there are only two training datasets (a) modern-trained and (b) LIG-trained. The
separate curves on each plot show different threshold selections. We have amended figure captions
in the hope to make this clearer. These figures do not represent diversity in any way, and we do not
refer to them in such a manner. We are simply looking at how latitudinal habitability changes under
different climate scenarios, and what implications this may have for diversity. For example, if
habitability is greater during the LIG at equatorial latitudes than today, it doesn’t make sense that
we would have an equatorial decline, at least due to abiotic reasons. In regards to the mismatch
between habitability and occurrences, one should not expect a perfect match. To provide a few
examples of why:
- You may find more occurrences in site A opposed to site B due to sampling
- Site A might have a higher level of connectivity than site B and receive more coral larvae
- Site B might be more environmentally suitable but is impacted by biotic and anthropogenic
interactions
- Distribution is impacted by historical reasons such as limits to dispersal
We thank the reviewers for the kind and constructive comments they have provided to
strengthen this manuscript. We feel that it has improved the quality of the manuscript
considerably and look forward to any further comments.
Kind regards,
Lewis A. Jones,

12 ABSTRACT
13 Reef corals are currently undergoing climatically-driven poleward range expansions, with some
14 evidence for equatorial range retractions. Predicting their response to future climate scenarios is
15 critical to their conservation, but ecological models are based only on short-term observations. The
16 fossil record provides the only empirical evidence for the long-term response of organisms under
17 perturbed climate states. The palaeontological record from the Last Interglacial (LIG; 125,000
18 years ago), a time of global warming, suggests that reef corals experienced poleward range shifts
19 and an equatorial decline relative to their modern distribution. However, this record is
20 spatiotemporally biased, and existing methods cannot account for data absence. Here, we use
21 ecological niche modelling to estimate reef corals’ realised niche and LIG distribution, based on
22 modern and fossil occurrences. We then make inferences about modelled habitability under two
23 future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5). Reef coral ranges during the LIG were
24 comparable to the present, with no prominent equatorial decrease in habitability. Reef corals are
25 likely to experience poleward range expansion and large equatorial declines under RCP4.5 and
26 RCP8.5. However, this range expansion is likely optimistic in the face of anthropogenic climate
27 change. Incorporation of fossil data in niche models improves forecasts of biodiversity responses
28 under global climatic change.

33 1 INTRODUCTION
34 Anthropogenic climate change, with projected global warming of 2–4.8°C, is the principle
35 challenge of the 21st century [1]. Rising sea surface temperatures, associated with global warming,
36 have already generated ecological disturbances and substantial range shifts of marine organisms
37 [2-4]. Today, reef corals house some of the most biologically diverse and economically valuable
38 ecosystems in the marine realm. Thermal stress, as a direct result of global warming, has generated
39 unprecedented mass bleaching of reef corals, with three pan-tropical events recorded in the last
40 two decades, leading to a decline in abundance, diversity, and habitat structure [5-7]. Global
41 warming has also led to clear poleward range expansion of some corals [8-12], although the
42 evidence for equatorial range retractions is debatable [9, 13]. However, because studies on extant
43 species are based on short-term observations, during which time a taxon might never have
44 occupied its full geographic or environmental space, it is difficult to predict whether this
45 expansion/retraction trend is a function of global warming, or simply reflects the ongoing response
46 of a species to a pre-existing forcing already applied to the system. Greater understanding of the
47 range dynamics of reef corals is therefore critical to their conservation.
48
49 Several studies have used ecological niche modelling (ENM) to evaluate the environmental
50 controls on coral reefs and predict global distribution under future climate change scenarios [14-
51 17]. However, the fossil record provides the only empirical evidence for the long-term responses
52 of organisms to environmental perturbations [e.g. 18], offering a ground-truth for model
53 projections under varying climate scenarios, and potentially enabling additional insights into niche
54 hypervolume (the full multi-dimensional abiotic space which a taxon might occupy indefinitely),
55 commonly referred to as the fundamental niche [19]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that
56 the integration of both palaeontological and neontological data improves biodiversity risk
57 assessments [20-23]. Future projections trained solely on modern-occurrences might therefore
58 underestimate habitability due to a restricted present-day range in climatic variation. Through
59 incorporation of the fossil record, more of this variation is captured. Thus, palaeontological data
60 from warmer intervals should improve projections to future climate scenarios that are closer
61 analogues than the present day.
2
62
63 Apparent range shifts have been observed in the Quaternary (2.58–0 Ma) fossil record of reef
64 corals [12, 13, 24, 25], with one study [13] demonstrating poleward range shifts and an equatorial
65 decline in reef corals during the Last Interglacial (LIG), ca. 125 thousand years ago (ka). Several
66 authors have provided approximations on global sea surface temperatures for the LIG, with
67 estimates ranging from no significant difference, to as much as 2°C warmer than today [26-28].
68 Kiessling et al. [13] proposed that this temperature rise was the driver of the dramatic range shifts
69 observed in LIG reef corals. Consequently, these authors suggested that anthropogenic global
70 warming today means that an equatorial decline of reef corals is likely to follow their current
71 poleward expansion, which has important implications for conservation, such as which geographic
72 regions should be prioritised. However, the fossil record is inherently biased both spatially and
73 temporally, impacted by incomplete sampling, variable fossil preservation, erosion, and burial.
74 Although existing subsampling methods, such as those applied by Kiessling et al. [13], can
75 ameliorate problems associated with uneven ‘raw’ occurrence data (e.g. ref. [29]), they cannot
76 account for the absence of data. ENM offers the prospect of mitigating for biases caused by the
77 uneven distribution of known occurrences (i.e. raw data) by measuring habitat availability,
78 providing insights into the potential geographic distribution of organisms through consideration of
79 their observed realised niche.
80
81 Here, we use ENM to: (1) evaluate the extent to which the LIG equatorial decline of reef corals is
82 the result of fossil bias or a genuine loss in habitability; (2) quantify the variation in geographic
83 range of reef corals during the LIG and under future climate scenarios, with implications for
84 understanding the evolution of the reef coral latitudinal biodiversity gradient; and (3) demonstrate
85 the value of utilising fossil reef coral data to improve biodiversity risk assessment through
86 consideration of the realised niche under varied climate states.
87 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
88 2.1 Biogeographic Data
89 When implementing ENM, most studies have focused on analyses of individual species [20, 30-
90 33]. However, due to the relative rarity of fossil occurrence data at global scale, we use occurrence
91 data at ecotype-level (i.e. a group which share specific environmental preferences). The responses
3
92 of modern coral reefs to environmental variables are broadly similar at a global level, recognised
93 as being limited to warm, clear, and shallow water habitats [34].
94
95 Modern coral occurrences were downloaded on July 5th, 2017 from the Ocean Biogeographic
96 Information System (OBIS; www.iobis.org) using the search criteria “Scleractinia”, yielding
97 589,817 occurrences. Fossil coral occurrence data were accessed on July 19th, 2017 through the
98 Paleobiology Database (PBDB; www.paleobiodb.org). The PBDB returned 8,021 occurrences for
99 Pleistocene Scleractinia. These datasets were then filtered to exclude data not identified to species
100 level, as well as further quality control checks (e.g. synonymisations). We based our analyses on
101 zooxanthellate corals, herein referred to as reef corals, which host unicellular organisms known as
102 zooxanthellae in their tissue, forming a photosymbiotic relationship [35]. Assignment to
103 zooxanthellate class focused on the principle of uniformitarianism for fossil coral taxa.
104 Azooxanthellate (those without a photosymbiotic relationship) and apozooxanthellate (those
105 which may or may not sustain a photosymbiotic relationship) corals were excluded from both
106 databases. Further quality control was performed on the OBIS dataset, whereby occurrences found
107 to occur on land or at depths greater than 100 m were removed under the assumption that there
108 were errors in their geographic coordinates, species identification, or are in fact fossil occurrences.
109 In addition, we omitted data collected from rapid ecological assessments to improve the credibility
110 of species level identification, as well as those from coral transplant studies. The PBDB data were
111 filtered to exclude occurrences which cannot be reliably assigned to the LIG. Duplicate occurrence
112 records of the same species from exactly the same coordinates were also removed from both
113 datasets.
114
115 The resultant modern occurrence dataset contains 700 zooxanthellate species, comprising 48,577
116 occurrences with 3,553 unique coordinates, whilst the LIG dataset contains 190 zooxanthellate
117 species, comprising 1,337 occurrences (from 301 collections) with 166 unique coordinates (Figure
118 1; SM1). In preparation of modelling, we clipped all occurrences by environmental layers to
119 correspond with the environmental data. To account for species that have become extinct since the
120 LIG, or that lack modern occurrence records in the OBIS, we excluded species which do not occur
121 in both the clipped fossil and modern datasets. The final modern and fossil datasets comprise 157
122 shared species, composed of 22,726 modern reef coral occurrences and 1,022 LIG reef coral fossil
4
123 occurrences. Finally, point occurrences were spatially subsampled at a raster resolution of 1.25° x
124 1.25° to account for sampling bias. Subsampling resulted in the retention of 295 presence sites for
125 modern reef corals and 56 for LIG reef corals (note that this does not affect the overall distribution,
126 but prevents multiple records being excessively weighted during model training) (Figure 1).

130 simulations were derived from HadCM3M2.1N [36], a version of UK Met Office HadCM3, a
131 coupled atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Model (GCM). HadCM3 has been heavily utilised
132 as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th and 5th assessment reports
133 [37] and successfully applied to studies of both present day and LIG climate and biodiversity [30,
134 36, 38-42]. Here we use IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 for our
135 future climate scenario simulations [43], a description of both is provided in SM2. To further
136 improve our ENMs, bathymetric data were extracted from Getech’s present day digital elevation
137 model (DEM), which provides gridded representations of both the Earth’s topography and
138 bathymetry. A description of both the GCM and DEM used in this study is provided in SM2, along
139 with data preparation protocols.
140
141 Environmental variables known to be ecologically limiting for modern corals (i.e. sea-surface
142 temperature [SST], salinity, irradiance and bathymetry) [14, 34, 35], and that can be viably
143 determined for the fossil record from GCM outputs, were chosen to reflect abiotic niche
144 characteristics (SM2: Table SM2). Initially, these variables were considered at several temporal
145 levels: annual, seasonal, and monthly. However, to reduce co-linearity between variables and
146 prevent over-fitting, we retained the combinations of climate variables with a Pearson’s pairwise
147 correlation coefficient of less than 0.7 (SM2: Figure SM2–7). After enquiry, five environmental
148 variables were used for final niche analysis: (1) mean annual SST; (2) mean December–February
149 irradiance; (3) mean June–August irradiance; (4) mean annual salinity; and (5) bathymetry. Whilst
150 we acknowledge that additional variables, in particular, aragonite saturation state might be
151 valuable for estimating reef coral distribution, not all variables can be viably approximated for the
152 geological past. Despite this, several biophysical studies have shown that the fundamental niche
153 of an organism can reasonably approximated by a limited set of biologically important variables
5
154 [e.g. 44]. In addition, Couce et al. [14, 15] demonstrated that high SST was the primary control on
155 coral reef distribution, with high light availability, salinity, aragonite saturation state, and low
156 nutrient concentrations being of secondary significance. Nevertheless, we ran sensitivity analyses
157 to compare modern projections from modern-trained models with and without aragonite saturation
158 state to gauge the potential impact upon our results (provided in SM2).
159
160 2.3 Niche Modelling & Quantifying Range Dynamics
161 2.3.1 Niche Comparisons
162 As previously noted, short-term observations of distribution dynamics can be inherently biased by
163 a taxon not occupying its full geographic or environmental space. However, an additional
164 fundamental question is whether environmental niches are conserved over evolutionary time scales
165 [45]. To evaluate this, we utilised the R-package ECOSPAT [46] to quantify measures of niche
166 margin dynamics (unfilling, expansion, and stability). We also performed niche overlap analyses,
167 testing for niche equivalency and similarity of the reef coral niches occupied across two temporal
168 windows (LIG and modern). The ECOSPAT niche overlap analysis applies kernel smoothers to
169 the densities of species occurrences in gridded environmental space, using a randomisation test
170 framework to compare observed equivalency and similarity to that anticipated under a null
171 hypothesis [46]. Both niche equivalency and similarity are quantified in terms of Schoener’s D
172 [47], with values ranging from 0 (least equivalent or similar) to 1 (most equivalent or similar). We
173 compared the subsampled occupied niches of LIG and modern reef corals using a principal
174 component analysis (PCA-env), testing the null hypothesis by randomly sampling 5000 replicates
175 of both LIG and modern niches. The PCA-env was calibrated with all five environmental variables
176 implemented in the construction of our ENMs, and allowed us to assess differences in the occupied
177 niche of reef corals from the LIG and modern (see ref. [48] for detailed descriptions of the
178 ECOSPAT package).
179
180 2.3.2 Ecological Niche Modelling
181 To map the potential distribution of reef corals in the modern, LIG, and under future climate
182 change scenarios (RCP4.5 & RCP8.5), we implemented three ENM methods: BIOCLIM [49],
183 randomForest [50], and MaxEnt ver. 3.4.1 [51]. In particular, MaxEnt has been shown to perform
184 well in previous studies on coral reefs, as well as those utilising the fossil record for other
185 taxonomic groups [14, 16, 30, 32, 52, 53]. ENMs were generated using the R package ‘biomod2’
6
186 ver. 3.3-7 [54, 55], running 100 subsample replicates with 75% of occurrences for model training,
187 whilst 25% were reserved (randomly seeded) for model testing. We generated two model classes,
188 training the ENM with both the LIG and modern occurrences, offering insights into the occupied
189 niche and distribution under two diverse climate states. Using the three ENM methods, we
190 produced an ensemble model based on mean projections from all modelling algorithms for each
191 climate scenario, and for each model class (LIG- and modern-trained). As reef corals reside at the
192 upper thermal limit of the oceans, we also built clamping masks for model projections to identify
193 geographic areas which indicate environmental variable values outside of the training range.
194
195 2.3.3 Range Comparisons
196 In order to measure distribution dynamics, we first generated 24 binary maps from the ensemble
197 models using two different training datasets (LIG reef corals and modern reef corals) and three
198 different binary thresholds for the four climate scenarios (LIG, modern, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We
199 selected three thresholds for binary conversion: the 5th-, 10th-, and 20th-percentiles of the lowest
200 tail of habitat suitability values (5LPT, 10LPT, 20LPT) associated with the occurrence data for
201 each model to provide insight into habitability dynamics (see SM2 for further details). As short-
202 term observations are intrinsically biased and perhaps incomplete in both environmental and
203 geographic space, we combined binary predictions generated from both LIG and modern training
204 datasets. This was done for each time-slice/climate scenario to establish a multi-temporal
205 approach, estimating the full geographic localities reef corals may occupy. We then assessed
206 whether this approach improved the models’ capability to predict the occurrence of both LIG and
207 modern localities, which would have implications for forecasting under future climate scenarios.
208 The latitudinal range and habitability of reef corals for past, present, and future climatic scenarios
209 was computed as a function of the sum of suitable cells, within 5° latitudinal bins, for each model
210 class’ projections (LIG, modern, and combined).
211
212 2.4 Model Validation
213 Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic [56], derived from
214 receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) [57]. In general,
215 evaluation criteria for AUC values have been interpreted as excellent (0.90–1.00), very good (0.8–
216 0.9), good (0.7–0.8), fair (0.6–0.7), and poor (0.5–0.6), whereas a score of < 0.5 is worse than one
217 would expect from a random model [58]. Evaluation scores for TSS range from -1 to 1, where a
7
218 score of 1 demonstrates perfect model performance, whilst < 0 is considered worse than a random
219 model [57]. As we used two ENM constructs (LIG- and modern-trained), and generated respective
220 forecasting and hindcasting (backtesting) projections, we calculated the AUC scores using LIG
221 occurrences and modern occurrences as an evaluation dataset for model projections to other
222 climate scenarios (i.e. modern-trained and LIG projection; LIG-trained and modern projection).
223 3 RESULTS
224 3.1 Niche Analyses
225 Niche margin analysis (SM2: Figure SM9) indicates considerable niche stability (91%) between
226 LIG and modern reef corals, with minimal expansion (8%) and unfilling (5%). Observed niche
227 overlap values for niche equivalency tests (Schoener’s D) fall within the null distribution of the
228 environment available to reef corals (p > 0.05), and thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis of
229 niche equivalency. However, the observed overlap value for the niche similarity tests is greater
230 than 95% (p < 0.05) of the simulated values, indicating modern reef corals occupy environments
231 similar to those of the LIG.
232
233 3.2 Ecological Niche Modelling
234 3.2.1 Model Performance
235
236 On the basis of the mean AUC scores (SM2: Figure SM11), the MaxEnt models performed best
237 for both modern-trained (MaxEnt: 0.974, randomForest: 0.963, BIOCLIM: 0.843) and LIG-trained
238 (MaxEnt: 0.976, randomForest: 0.950, BIOCLIM: 0.807) models, across individual projections.
239 Conferring to AUC evaluation criteria [58], all models performed excellently with the exception
240 of the BIOCLIM models, which can still be considered as very good (see SM2: Figure SM12–13
241 for ROC plots). TSS scores reflect similar results in terms of model performance for modern-
242 trained (MaxEnt: 0.899, RandomForest: 0.866, BIOCLIM: 0.685) and LIG-trained ENMs
243 (MaxEnt: 0.924, RandomForest: 0.832, BIOCLIM: 0.615), with all models performing
244 excellently, except BIOCLIM (SM2: Figure SM11). The modern-trained ensemble model had
245 AUC scores of 0.979, 0.975, and 0.961 (SM2: Figure SM14), for the full occurrence dataset, test
246 dataset, and evaluation dataset, respectively. Whereas, the LIG-trained had AUC scores of 0.985,
247 0.984, and 0.965 (SM2: Figure SM14). In addition, combined modern binary projections were able
248 to predict 95%, 91%, and 83% of modern occurrences for 5LPT, 10LPT, and 20LPT, respectively,
249 whilst LIG-trained only projections were able to predict 62%, 59%, and 51%. Similarly, combined
8
250 LIG binary projections were able to predict 98%, 95%, and 88% of LIG fossil occurrences for
251 5LPT, 10LPT, and 20LPT, whereas modern-trained only projections were able to predict 93%,
252 79%, and 54%.
253
254 3.2.2 Geographic Predictions
255 The results from binary habitability maps (Figure 2; raw, binary, and clamping mask maps
256 available in SM2: Figure SM15–22) for models trained on the modern occurrence dataset predict
257 a larger habitable region at low latitudes (0°–30°) than the LIG-trained ENM for all climate
258 scenarios, converging only at higher latitudes. Models trained on the LIG occurrence dataset
259 consistently calculate a smaller sum of habitable cells within the tropics than the modern trained
260 ENM. Combining model outputs (SM2: Figure SM23–24) for both modern-trained and LIG-
261 trained ENMs shows no distinctive increase in habitable cells at varying latitudes for all climate
262 scenarios under the binary thresholds 5LPT and 10LPT. However, under the binary conversion
263 threshold 20LPT (Figure 3), the combined data increases the predicted habitability substantially at
264 higher latitudes in the northern hemisphere, yet provides no such significant results for lower
265 latitudes or in the southern hemisphere.
266
267 Threshold selection for binary conversion has important consequences on predicted habitability
268 for future climate scenarios. When comparing predictions from modern-trained ENMs and
269 different binary thresholds, LIG and modern habitability predictions reduce uniformly between
270 thresholds, whilst RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 do not (Figure 2). When applying binary threshold 5LPT,
271 global habitability seems to increase under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. However, under 20LPT, there is
272 a substantial reduction in habitability relative to the modern and LIG. These results suggest that
273 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, there will be an increase in marginal habitats for reef corals, and a
274 prominent decrease in those more favourable.
275
276 3.2.3 Range Dynamics
277 The LIG binary maps (hindcasted and trained) indicate habitat suitability at equatorial latitudes
278 (Figure 2–3) for all binary thresholds. For latitudinal bin 0–5°, the LIG trained ENM predicts 52,
279 51, and 45 presence cells for 5LPT, 10LPT, and 20LPT respectively, whereas the modern trained
280 ENM predicts 116, 86, and 63 cells. (SM3). Based on the results from the combined, modern-
281 trained, and LIG-trained projections, for all binary thresholds, habitability was generally greater
9
282 within the tropics (-25 to 25°) during the LIG than in the modern (Figure 2; Figure SM23–25;
283 SM3). More specifically, results from the combined projections indicate that LIG equatorial
284 regions (-5 to 5°) were more habitable than during the modern, with 34 (5LPT), 19 (10LPT), and
285 40 (20LPT) additional habitable cells predicted. In addition, habitability is generally greater at
286 higher latitudes in both hemispheres for the LIG than in the modern, for all binary thresholds,
287 suggesting that reef coral range size was likely larger during this time. To provide example, for
288 5LPT, only 3 cells were predicted for latitudinal bin 40–45° in the modern northern hemisphere,
289 yet 14 cells were predicted for the LIG (Figure 2; SM3).
290
291 Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the models predict a considerable decrease in habitability (for all
292 binary thresholds) within the tropics with a 5% (5LPT), 20% (10LPT), and 59% (20LPT) loss in
293 habitable cells for RCP 8.5 relative to the modern (SM3), notably in the centre of the hyper-diverse
294 Coral Triangle (Indo-Pacific Ocean) (Figure 3). In contrast, habitability increases significantly at
295 higher latitudes (25–45°) in the northern hemisphere (Figure 3), with a 36% (5LPT), 40% (10LPT),
296 and 43% (20LPT) increase in habitable cells from the modern (SM3). South of the equator, there
297 is a similar gain at higher latitudes (25° to 45°), with a 30% (5LPT), 40% (10LPT), and 46%
298 (20LPT) increase in habitable cells (SM3). However, the clamping masks, particularly for RCP8.5,
299 highlight some uncertainty for equatorial tropical latitudes due to one environmental variable being
300 outside the range used for model calibration (SM2: Figure SM21–22). This finding highlights the
301 need to incorporate fossil data from various climatic regimes to reduce uncertainty when projecting
302 to future climate scenarios, which represent climate conditions outside modern experience [59].
303 4 DISCUSSION
304 The LIG has occasionally been considered as an analogue for the impacts of global warming on
305 species’ distribution [13, 60, 61]. At face value, the LIG fossil record of reef corals depicts a global
306 biogeographic pattern that is considerably dissimilar to that observed in the present day (Figure 1).
307 Whereas today, both species abundance and diversity are highest within the tropics, with an
308 equatorial dip, the LIG record shows a poleward shift in occurrence records and species diversity,
309 with both increasing at higher latitudes in the northern hemisphere, and a prominent equatorial
310 decline [24, 25]. Support for this observed pattern is also provided when subsampling methods are
311 applied to ameliorate biases pertaining to uneven latitudinal sampling [13]. However, using ENM,
312 our findings provide little support for an equatorial decline in habitability for reef corals during
10
313 the LIG. Instead, LIG reef corals occupied similar, though not equivalent, niches to those of
314 modern reef corals. Our results suggest that during the LIG, global habitability was generally
315 greater than the modern, particularly at equatorial latitudes. In addition, modelled habitability is
316 more pronounced at high latitudes in both hemispheres, particularly, within the northern
317 hemisphere. These results support a poleward range expansion of reef corals during the LIG, as
318 suggested by previous studies [13, 24], but not an equatorial decline [13]. This suggests that the
319 observed equatorial decline in the fossil record might be a result of sampling bias within equatorial
320 regions.
321
322 Under climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, our results indicate that high latitude habitability
323 should increase (i.e. range expansion), whilst equatorial latitudes will see a large decrease in
324 favourable habitats (i.e. range retraction) compared to the modern. Most notably, this includes the
325 centre of the Coral Triangle, in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, the ‘heart’ of modern day coral
326 biodiversity, with 605 reef coral species, representing over three-quarters of global reef coral
327 diversity [62]. In addition to the direct risk to biodiversity (including the multitude of species that
328 live in reef coral environments), the economic, social, and cultural benefits that coral reefs provide
329 are of crucial importance to island communities within this region [63, 64]. However, our results
330 do also suggest that under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, we can expect to see an increase in marginal
331 habitats within the coral triangle, which might have important implications for future recovery.
332 Nevertheless, it should also be borne in mind that reef corals, and coral reef ecosystems, are far
333 less likely to survive other stressors, such as overfishing and pollution, when residing in marginal
334 habitats. Furthermore, as our projections do not include aragonite saturation state they may be
335 relatively optimistic in the face of anthropogenic climate change as they do not account for the
336 impacts of ocean acidification.
337
338 4.1 Implications for the evolution of the Latitudinal Biodiversity Gradient
339 Attempts to reconstruct latitudinal biodiversity gradients in geological time have historically been
340 achieved using direct reading of occurrence records [65], potentially leading to circumscribed
341 results [66]. Although subsampling approaches have been applied in more recent studies, and
342 provide more useful insights than uncorrected ‘raw’ diversity data [13], they ultimately cannot
343 predict which data we might be missing, i.e. fossils and/or palaeoenvironments that we have not
11
344 sampled, or that never entered the fossil record [67, 68]. Our model results suggest that the LIG
345 reef coral record is geographically biased through the amount of predicted habitable area within
346 latitudinal bins, herein referred to as the latitudinal habitability gradient. Thus, we predict that,
347 given suitable preservational conditions, we should expect to find additional LIG reef coral
348 occurrence data from equatorial latitudes.
349
350 ‘Modern-type’ latitudinal biodiversity gradients, with tropical peaks in diversity, have been
351 suggested to form under cold icehouse climate regimes, whereas flattened gradients or temperate
352 peaks are restricted to warmer greenhouse regimes [66]. Additionally, it has been proposed that
353 non-modern-type latitudinal biodiversity gradients might also form during interglacials [66, 69].
354 However, based on modelled habitability, our findings imply a contrarian result for the LIG, and
355 suggest that interglacials might not be warm enough to produce latitudinal biodiversity gradients
356 similar to those we observe in greenhouse climate regimes.
357
358 4.2 Utility of the fossil record in forecasting
359 Variable contribution analyses computed within biomod2 [55] clearly demonstrates that
360 bathymetry and SST are the principal parameters controlling the distribution of both modern and
361 LIG reef corals (SM2: Table SM3). It is to be expected that bathymetry has the largest explanative
362 power as the very nature of reef (zooxanthellate) corals restricts them to shallow marine settings.
363 Whilst LIG bathymetry is generally similar to that of the modern at a global scale, several areas
364 have experienced localised tectonic uplift (e.g. Huon Peninsula, Barbados, Sumba, and Vanuatu
365 [70]). However, this is not likely to impact our results, based on our sea-level sensitivity test (see
366 SM 2). As both models used the same DEM, SST might be considered the dominant factor in
367 determining any difference between ENM and projected distributions. In fact, our results are in
368 line with those suggested by palaeoclimatic proxy and modelling data, which propose that annual
369 mean SST and seasonality at low latitudes for the LIG was similar to that of the modern [27, 28,
370 70]. Data from uplifted LIG coral reefs from the Huon Peninsula of New Guinea and western
371 Australia also indicate mean annual temperatures and seasonal ranges comparable to present day
372 SST [70, 71]. However, it has also been suggested that seasonality was greater at higher latitudes,
373 with increased SST and insolation modelled in the northern hemisphere [27, 72, 73]. This might
374 have permitted reef corals to reside at greater depths at higher latitudes, as well as at more poleward
12
375 localities due to higher insolation and SST in the LIG, as supported by our habitability modelling
376 results.
377
378 To avoid environmentally-driven extinction, taxa need to be able to adapt to changing
379 environments, either through distributional shifts (i.e. habitat tracking), or by altering their abiotic
380 preferences [24, 30, 74]. The thermal limits of organisms are widely acknowledged as shaping
381 diversity gradients on geological timescales (e.g. [69, 75, 76]). Although the latitudinal habitability
382 gradient remained fairly stable between the LIG and modern climatic regimes, we might expect to
383 see a greater reshaping of the latitudinal habitability and biodiversity gradients under future
384 scenarios. Whilst reef corals might be able to adapt over geological time intervals, it is unlikely
385 that they will be able to keep pace with the rapid rate of climatic change predicted under RCP4.5
386 or RCP8.5 scenarios. Studies based solely on modern occurrences [16, 77] propose a much more
387 drastic decline in coral reefs under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios than our results indicate for reef
388 corals. This is likely the consequence of differences in methodological approach, selection of
389 environmental variables, GCMs, and differences in training datasets for modelling. Perhaps of
390 particular note is the lack of aragonite saturation state and cumulative thermal stress variables
391 applied in this study, whereas bathymetry was not directly considered in others (see [16]). We
392 acknowledge that the inclusion of environmental variables such as aragonite saturation state would
393 likely improve our model predictions; however, such data is not available for the geological record.
394 With this in mind, our model outputs are likely optimistic in the face of anthropogenic climate
395 change, particularly for reef corals in high latitude regions, as the aragonite saturation state is
396 generally lower than at tropical and temperate latitudes [78]. In relation to other environmental
397 variables, best practice requires the construction of generalised models when projecting to other
398 time slices. An ENM focused on one spatial or temporal extent may perform very well with a large
399 number of explanatory variables. However, an ENM might also find causal relationships that are
400 non-existent, resulting in over-fitting, hindering the applicability and any projections of the model
401 under different spatial/temporal extents. Sensitivity analyses comparing modern projections from
402 modern-trained ENMs with and without aragonite saturation state suggest little difference between
403 predictions at global scale. However, some noticeable variations are observable at local scale
404 (SM2: Figure SM2). Our variable contribution analyses indicate aragonite saturation state is of
405 secondary importance in the construction of global ENMs (SM2: Table SM 1). However, under
13
406 continued acidification of the world’s oceans, aragonite saturation state may become more of a
407 limiting factor for reef corals than what is observed in the modern. Therefore, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5
408 projections should be considered as relatively optimistic in the face of continued CO2 emissions.
409 However, this is conditional on reef corals being able to acclimatise to heightened temperatures or
410 shift distributions to suitable temperature localities in the first place. Integrating palaeontological
411 data into ENM promotes two clear advantages to aid model projections: (1) the opportunity to test
412 models with empirical evidence across temporal windows and climate regimes, and (2) the ability
413 to combine palaeontological and neontological data to consider the full ecological limits of a
414 particular taxon, rather than just the occupied niche in its current biogeographic pattern.
415
416 Although the LIG fossil record is biased, the inclusion of fossil reef coral data provides additional
417 insight into the niche hypervolume and potential distribution of reef corals under future climate
418 change. As with previous studies [20], predictions including fossil data suggest significantly more
419 habitability at wider geographical ranges than those based solely on modern occurrences. ENM
420 predictions which only include modern occurrences run the risk of modelling the occupied niche,
421 whereas, fossil occurrences can provide additional understanding into the fundamental niche of a
422 species [79, 80]. Indeed, this particular study still might provide limited insights into the
423 fundamental niche due the incompleteness of the LIG reef coral record. However, the inclusion of
424 fossil occurrences enables us to test which models perform best across temporal boundaries, as
425 well as the importance of establishing the fundamental niche using true positive fraction. It is clear
426 from our results that a multi-temporal approach improves predictive performance, particularly
427 when considering higher binary thresholds, providing support for projected habitat suitability
428 under future climate scenarios.
429 5 CONCLUSIONS
430 Our results suggest that LIG reef corals might have expanded their poleward ranges during the
431 LIG, but that they did not experience an equatorial decline. Instead, the apparent equatorial decline
432 appears to reflect an aspect of bias (i.e. absence of reported fossil collections/occurrences) that
433 cannot currently be ameliorated by existing subsampling approaches. Our findings are in
434 agreement with the results from multiple modelling and palaeoclimatic studies, which suggest that
435 annual mean sea surface temperature and seasonal ranges at equatorial latitudes in the LIG were
436 comparable to today [27, 28, 70]. Under the future (2100 AD) climate scenario RCP4.5 and
14
437 RCP8.5, our results suggest a relatively large decrease in habitat suitability at equatorial latitudes,
438 and an increase at higher latitudes, particularly within the northern hemisphere. However, our
439 conclusions are likely somewhat optimistic in the face of anthropogenic climate change as they do
440 not account for ocean acidification, destructive fishing practices, or other anthropogenic
441 environmental impacts, and yet they make alarming predictions. Finally, the fossil record provides
442 additional insights into the niche hypervolume of reef corals, and improves predictive
443 performance. Consequently, the fossil record might improve biodiversity risk assessments under
444 future climate change and it should therefore play an important role in focusing conservation
445 efforts.

699 Figure 1. Latitudinal and global distribution of modern and LIG reef coral occurrences. (a-b) Frequency of
700 occurrence records (Occ), species diversity (SIB) and shared species (species present in both time slices
701 [sSIB]) of reef corals binned at 5° latitudinal zones. (c) World distribution map of shared species
702 (subsampled at 1.25° x 1.25° and clipped to environmental data) between the modern and the LIG. Grey
703 shaded area represents the extent of the tropics in the present day. Dashed lines indicate the equator, the
704 Northern Tropic, and the Southern Tropic.
705 Figure 2. Latitudinal plots for predicted habitability from ecological niche modelling, using three binary
706 thresholds: the 5th-, 10th-, and 20th-percentiles of the lowest tail of habitat suitability values (5LPT, 10LPT,
707 and 20LPT). Plots indicate habitability for the Last Interglacial (LIG), modern, representative concentration
708 pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5), and 8.5 (RCP8.5). In this instance, habitability is the sum of cells designated as
709 habitable, within 5° latitudinal bins, by the mean prediction, trained on the (a) modern occurrence dataset,
710 and (b) LIG occurrence dataset. Grey shaded area represents the extent of the tropics in the present day.
711 Dashed lines indicating the equator, the Northern Tropic, and the Southern Tropic.
712 Figure 3. Combined binary maps (using threshold 20LPT) showing the potential distribution of reef corals
713 under LIG, modern, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate regimes. (a) Global maps of habitability under the four
714 climate scenarios. Grey cells represent the potential distribution predicted through using only the modern
715 reef coral training dataset. Yellow cells characterise cells gained when coupling LIG and modern trained
716 predictions. Blue cells indicate unsuitable locations, whilst black indicates no data cells (landmass). (b)
717 Habitability maps clipped to Indo-Pacific for all climate scenarios to highlight change in habitability within
718 the coral triangle. Yellow cells highlight suitable habitats, whilst blue cells indicate unsuitable locations,
719 and black indicates no data cells (landmass).
