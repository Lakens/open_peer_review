Theoretical study of the structures of bimetallic Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters up to 108 atoms by R.
Du, X. Wu, Y. Xu, R. Chen and T. Liu
The authors have used a variation around genetic algorithms together with a many-body
potential to determine putative global minima for Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters at 1:1, 3:1 and 1:3
compositions, containing up to 108 atoms in total. The structures are discussed in terms of their
radial distributions and basic high-symmetry motifs such as icosahedra or tetrahedra.
There have been a plethora of similar computational works in the recent decade (global
optimization of bimetallic EAM clusters), usually employing genetic algorithms as well, and I
think the authors should emphasize the novelty in their methods and results somewhat better.
Until then I will postpone my recommendation for publishing this work.
More precisely, I think the following remarks should be addressed in a revised version of this
manuscript.
(i) In the present work, biases are often used, by prescribing high symmetry cores. In the
description of the method, and although the authors admit about this bias, it would be useful to
the readers already familiar with the basics of genetic algorithms what is new and essential in this
'AIOA-IC' method. For instance, how higher in energy are the putative global minima obtained
without the 'IC' bias? Also, how robust are the minima obtained, in terms of the chances of
success by repeating the global minimization a (small) number of independent times?
(ii) For Au-Ag clusters at 1:1 composition, the authors systematically find energy minima that are
lower than those obtained previously by the Johnston group but it was a bit unclear to me
whether these differences are qualitative or quantitative. In particular, they may well result from
slightly different implementations of the same Gupta potential, even when the same set of EAM
parameters are used. For instance, the use of cut-offs with different values (notably in the
Johnston group) could explain why lower energies are found here if no cut-off were used to
truncate the interactions.
(iii) The radial distance is used as the main order parameter to discuss the different distributions
of unlike atoms in the clusters. In this respect, Figure 6 clearly shows that Ag atoms are outside
while Au atoms are inside, IN AVERAGE, the opposite trend being found between Au and Cu.
Naive visual inspection confirms these trends, but the authors conclude the paper by writing that
'there is no tendency to form core-shell configuraions in the investigated Ag-Au clusters'. Thus
requires some clarification!
Perhaps, if the goal is to show that the atoms are broadly distributed throughout the cluster
rather than in a core-shell fashion, the second moment of the radial distribution should be used
instead of the first moment reflected in equation (4), namely <r_i^2>-<r_i>^2.
(iv) Gold and silver easily mix in the bulk, and the same is true to a large extent at the nanoscale.
Wet chemistry conditions allow core-shell structures to be made, but they are then more likely to
be kinetically controlled rather than thermodynamically. Could the authors discuss the energy
3
gap between the two lowest-energy isomers that they found, and mention whether the second
lowest-energy structure is structurally different from the first, or just an homotop?
(v) Please carefully proofread the english when resubmitting.

This paper demonstrates the nice efficiency of the optimization algorithm proposed by the
authors. As listed in Table 2, a lot of new global minima are found. The finding of new global
minima is important and worth reporting in the journal. The calculations seem sound and well
performed up to my knowledge, since parameters (F. Cleri and V. Rosato) used in the
calculations seem adequate for reliable results within the framework of the semi-empirical Gupta
calculation. Three different stoichiometries 1:1, 1.3 and 3:1 are considered for Ag-Au and Cu-Au
clusters. Furthermore, the difference between geometrical structures and atomic distribution for
Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters is discussed. In summary I recommend publication after revision as
explained below.
1) For Ag-Au clusters, more results with theoretical calculations should be mentioned.
2) This work has carried on the theory research to Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters. It is suggested that
their application prospects should be prospected and even their performance calculation results
in fields such as catalysis should be provided.
3) The authors should make an in-depth study of the performance advantages and the
mechanism of action of bimetallic compounds. Some related papers may be referenced, such as,

Second report on RSOS190342
Theoretical study of the structures of bimetallic Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters up to 108 atoms
by R. Du, S. Tang, X. Wu, Y. Xu, R. Chen, T. Liu
The authors have taken most of the comments into account, except for some points raised and not
8
addressed at all. I am listing below some remaining issues that need to be addressed before
publication can be recommended.
-One question raised was about statistics: how is the robustness of the method in locating the
putative global minima? I was asking about the probability of success by repeating the
optimization a number of (independent) times, but got no reply, and the revision shows no
change in this respect. The superiority of the algorithm requires such data to be provided for a
meaningful evaluation.
-The idea of seeding the geometries with cores with prescribed symmetry is quite old, Hartke
already used it more than 20 year ago in a paper on LJ clusters. He then called them 'niches'.
-The order parameter R is introduced to 'explain the atomic distribution or mixing degree of
different elements', but I found this paragraph really descriptive rather than providing any
explanation. The authors really need to dig deeper.
On a side comment, in their response to earlier criticism, a confusion appears about the many-
body potential used in this study (and earlier by Johnston et al.), the 'cut-off' function I was
refering to being a truncation of the pair terms for repulsion and in function mimicking the
electronic density to some nearest-neighbors. Usually this cut-off proceeds through a continuous
function for optimisation purposes, in no way it is related to cut-offs in the DFT calculations,
where it refers there to truncation in the amount of plane waves that are used in the basis set.

Du, X. Wu, Y. Xu, R. Chen and T. Liu
Overall the authors have addressed most of the concerns I raised in my previous report. I still
believe some of the discussion is pretty shallow, notably in discussing the radial repartition of
atoms through the radial average distance. Perhaps a single indicator combining the radial
distance of the two types of atoms would have done the job of telling whether the structures are
mixed or of any of the two possible core-shell types.
I now recommend this article for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper demonstrates the nice efficiency of the optimization algorithm proposed by the
authors. As listed in Table 2, a lot of new global minima are found. The finding of new global
minima is important and worth reporting in the journal. The calculations seem sound and well
performed up to my knowledge, since parameters (F. Cleri and V. Rosato) used in the
calculations seem adequate for reliable results within the framework of the semi-empirical Gupta
calculation. Three different stoichiometries 1:1, 1.3 and 3:1 are considered for Ag-Au and Cu-Au
clusters. Furthermore, the difference between geometrical structures and atomic distribution for
Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters is discussed. In summary I recommend publication after revision as
explained below.
1) For Ag-Au clusters, more results with theoretical calculations should be mentioned.
2) This work has carried on the theory research to Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters. It is suggested that
their application prospects should be prospected and even their performance calculation results
in fields such as catalysis should be provided.
3) The authors should make an in-depth study of the performance advantages and the
mechanism of action of bimetallic compounds. Some related papers may be referenced, such as,
Chem. Mater., 2014, 26, 3418-3426; J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015, 3, 20973-20982; Nano Res. 2017, 10,
3726-3742; ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2017, 9, 40655-40670; Nanoscale, 2019, 11, 6243–6253.
4) There are many typo and grammar mistakes. And several references are repeated. Please revise
the manuscript carefully.

Report on RSOS-190342R2
Theoretical study of the structures of bimetallic Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters up to 108 atoms by R.
Du, X. Wu, Y. Xu, R. Chen and T. Liu
Overall the authors have addressed most of the concerns I raised in my previous report. I still
believe some of the discussion is pretty shallow, notably in discussing the radial repartition of
atoms through the radial average distance. Perhaps a single indicator combining the radial
distance of the two types of atoms would have done the job of telling whether the structures are
mixed or of any of the two possible core-shell types.
I now recommend this article for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
A list of changes and replies to the reviewer’s comments
We first thank the reviewer for his/her positive evaluation and valuable suggestions,
and the following is our response to individual problems.
For the reviewer #1’s comments:
1. Q: In the present work, biases are often used, by prescribing high symmetry cores.
In the description of the method, and although the authors admit about this bias, it
would be useful to the readers already familiar with the basics of genetic
algorithms what is new and essential in this 'AIOA-IC' method. For instance, how
higher in energy are the putative global minima obtained without the 'IC' bias?
Also, how robust are the minima obtained, in terms of the chances of success by
repeating the global minimization a (small) number of independent times?
A: The reviewer’s considerations were reasonable. However, for the structural
optimization of Cu-Au and Ag-Au clusters, the efficiency of AIOA-IC method
was significantly higher than that of AIOA (without constraint). Therefore, if the
constraint is relaxed, under the same run times, the global minimum structures
demonstrated in this work would hard to be obtained by AIOA. In fact, in order to
enhance the unbiased property of the AIOA-IC method, the starting structures
were also randomly generated and local minimized with the same probability,
which has been introduced in this manuscript and previous papers (Du RB, Xu
YQ, Sun Y, Wu X, Journal of Alloys and Compounds 774 (2019) 677-684, doi:
10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.10.069).
2. Q: For Au-Ag clusters at 1:1 composition, the authors systematically find energy
minima that are lower than those obtained previously by the Johnston group but it
was a bit unclear to me whether these differences are qualitative or quantitative. In
particular, they may well result from slightly different implementations of the
same Gupta potential, even when the same set of EAM parameters are used. For
instance, the use of cut-offs with different values (notably in the Johnston group)
could explain why lower energies are found here if no cut-off were used to
truncate the interactions.
A: According to the comment of the reviewer, we re-examined the potential
parameters of the Gupta potential for Ag-Au clusters, and confirmed that the same
parameters were taken. The results are quantitatively compared with those by
Johnston group, and they are all listed in Table 2. In order to conform that the
same parameters were used, we also optimized AgnAun (n = 10-30) clusters with
small sizes, and obtained the same structures and energies as in the literature
(Chen FY, Johnston RL. 2008 ACS Nano 2, 165-175. doi: 10.1021/nn700226y).
Furthermore, the corresponding description was modified from page 7, line -2 to
page 8, line 1. On the other hand, we also examined the use of cut-off values, and
found that they were mainly used in DFT calculations.
3. Q: The radial distance is used as the main order parameter to discuss the different
distributions of unlike atoms in the clusters. In this respect, Figure 6 clearly shows
that Ag atoms are outside while Au atoms are inside, IN AVERAGE, the opposite
trend being found between Au and Cu. Naive visual inspection confirms these
trends, but the authors conclude the paper by writing that 'there is no tendency to
form core-shell configuraions in the investigated Ag-Au clusters'. Thus requires
some clarification! Perhaps, if the goal is to show that the atoms are broadly
distributed throughout the cluster rather than in a core-shell fashion, the second
moment of the radial distribution should be used instead of the first moment
reflected in equation (4), namely <r_i^2>-<r_i>^2.
A: The reviewer was right. The sentence of “Therefore, there is no tendency to
form core-shell configurations in the investigated Ag-Au clusters.” was inaccurate,
and it was deleted in the revised manuscript.
4. Q: Gold and silver easily mix in the bulk, and the same is true to a large extent at
the nanoscale. Wet chemistry conditions allow core-shell structures to be made,
but they are then more likely to be kinetically controlled rather than
thermodynamically. Could the authors discuss the energy gap between the two
lowest-energy isomers that they found, and mention whether the second
lowest-energy structure is structurally different from the first, or just an homotop?
A: For the first lowest-energy isomer and the second lowest-energy structure of
AgnAun clusters, there indeed exist structural differences in some cases. For
example, as plotted below, in our optimized Ag30Au30 cluster, the energy of the
first lowest-energy structure was -188.3738 eV, and the corresponding one of the
second lowest-energy structure was -188.3569 eV. The energy difference was only
0.0169 eV, but the structures were very different.
5. Q: Please carefully proofread the english when resubmitting.
A: According to the suggestion of the reviewer, English language was modified
through the manuscript.
For the reviewer #2’s comments:
1. Q: For Ag-Au clusters, more results with theoretical calculations should be
mentioned.
A: According to the suggestion of the reviewer, more references on Ag-Au
clusters were added, and the corresponding description was modified on page 3,
lines 11-13.
2. Q: This work has carried on the theory research to Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters. It is
suggested that their application prospects should be prospected and even their
performance calculation results in fields such as catalysis should be provided.
A: The Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters have been widely studied in the fields of
medicine, biology, catalysis, optics, and electronics as introduced in our
manuscript. The reviewer suggested a valuable question for the application of our
results in fields such as catalysis. But, it was indeed hard for us to explore this
problem.
3. Q: The authors should make an in-depth study of the performance advantages and
the mechanism of action of bimetallic compounds. Some related papers may be
referenced, such as, Chem. Mater., 2014, 26, 3418-3426; J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015,
3, 20973-20982; Nano Res. 2017, 10, 3726-3742; ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces
2017, 9, 40655-40670; Nanoscale, 2019, DOI: 10.1039/C9NR00962K.
A: According to the comment of the reviewer, some papers on the bimetallic
compounds were referenced. Since bimetallic compounds were not covered in this
manuscript, relevant descriptions were modified on page 2, lines 4-5, and 7.
4. Q: There are many typo and grammar mistakes. And several references are
repeated. Please revise the manuscript carefully.
A: According to the suggestion of the reviewer, English language was modified
through the manuscript, and the references were examined.
Appendix B
A list of changes and replies to the reviewer’s comments
We first thank the reviewer for his/her positive evaluation and valuable suggestions,
and the following is our response to individual problems.
For the reviewer #1’s comments:
1. Q: One question raised was about statistics: how is the robustness of the method
in locating the putative global minima? I was asking about the probability of
success by repeating the optimization a number of (independent) times, but got no
reply, and the revision shows no change in this respect. The superiority of the
algorithm requires such data to be provided for a meaningful evaluation.
A: According to the suggestion of the reviewer, the number of runs (over 100
independent runs) for locating the stable structures of Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters
up to 108 atoms were added. Considering that the description of structural
optimization for the investigated clusters was introduced in different paragraphs of
the manuscript, we added the corresponding successful rates to the supplementary
files. On the other hand, a brief description of successful rates for the algorithm
was added on page 11, lines 1-5.
2. Q: The idea of seeding the geometries with cores with prescribed symmetry is
quite old, Hartke already used it more than 20 year ago in a paper on LJ clusters.
He then called them 'niches'.
A: The reviewer was right, and this reminder was helpful. The corresponding
literature was cited and described on page 6, line -1.
3. Q: The order parameter R is introduced to 'explain the atomic distribution or
mixing degree of different elements', but I found this paragraph really descriptive
rather than providing any explanation. The authors really need to dig deeper.
A: We thank the reviewer for his/her comments. But we have not found a better
way to describe the atomic distribution. The order parameter R described in this
manuscript was also used in the reported works, such as “N. T. Wilson, R. L.
Johnston, A theoretical study of atom ordering in copper-gold nanoalloy clusters. J.
Mater. Chem., 2002, 12, 2913-2922, doi: 10.1039/b204069g”.
4. Q: On a side comment, in their response to earlier criticism, a confusion appears
about the many-body potential used in this study (and earlier by Johnston et al.),
the 'cut-off' function I was referring to being a truncation of the pair terms for
repulsion and in function mimicking the electronic density to some
nearest-neighbors. Usually this cut-off proceeds through a continuous function for
optimization purposes, in no way it is related to cut-offs in the DFT calculations,
where it refers there to truncation in the amount of plane waves that are used in
the basis set.
A: We consulted the related literatures (such as N.T. Wilson, M.S. Bailey, R. L.
Johnston, Atom ordering in cuboctahedral Ni-Al nanoalloys. Inorganica Chimica
Acta, 2006, 359, 3649-3658, doi: 10.1016/j.ica.2006.02.029) and concluded that
the reviewer was right. However, we did not use cut-off constraint in the Gupta
potential. The cut-off values indeed reflected pairwise repulsive term and the
attractive many-body terms. Apparently, if the cut-off values were used in the
optimization of the stable structures of Ag-Au clusters of 1:1 composition up to
150 atoms by Johnston, the obtained results might be different from the
corresponding ones without cut-off constraint. Therefore, according to the
comment of the reviewer, the additional description was added on page 8, lines
12-16.
Appendix C
A list of changes and replies to the reviewer’s comments
We first thank the reviewer for his/her positive evaluation and valuable suggestions,
and the following is our response to individual problems.
For the editor’s comments:
1. Q: Please also include the following statements alongside the other end
statements. As we cannot publish your manuscript without these end statements
included, if you feel that a given heading is not relevant to your paper, please
nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state that it is not relevant to your
work. We have included a screenshot example of the end statements for reference.
Acknowledgements.
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet
the authorship criteria.
A: According to the suggestion, the declaration of Acknowledgements was added
in the revised manuscript.
For the reviewer #1’s comments:
1. Q: Overall the authors have addressed most of the concerns I raised in my
previous report. I still believe some of the discussion is pretty shallow, notably in
discussing the radial repartition of atoms through the radial average distance.
Perhaps a single indicator combining the radial distance of the two types of atoms
would have done the job of telling whether the structures are mixed or of any of
the two possible core-shell types.
A: After consulting the literature and thinking carefully, we could not find a more
appropriate way to describe the segregation pattern. Furthermore, the core-shell
pattern in Ag-Au and Cu-Au clusters could indeed be seen through the radial
average distance. So, no more descriptions would be added.
