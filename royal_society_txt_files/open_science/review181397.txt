The authors found a dielectric anomaly induced by chlorine doping in DIPAB. It is interesting
and very meaningful. Through temperature dependent Raman spectrum, X-ray diffraction and
DSC measurements, it is found that the dielectric anomaly below the curie temperature is not
caused by phase transition and has no specific heat variety. The freezing of ferroelectric domain
walls induced by the pinning of point defects may be responsible for the dielectric anomaly.
Similar dielectric anomaly has been found in inorganic relaxor ferroelectric which usually
happened at low temperature at about 100-200 K. This dielectric anomaly occurring in molecular
ferroelectric materials above room temperature is very unusual.
In the past, doping effect have been deeply studied in inorganic ferroelectrics. Yet, doping effect
may be different and complicated in molecular ferroelectrics which has not been fully studied.
DIPAB is a molecular based ferroelectric material with great potential for application. So this
study will be helpful to the application of molecular ferroelectrics. This has important reference
value for the research of doping modification of molecular based ferroelectrics. So I recommend
this manuscript to be published with minor revision.
Some minor errors should be corrected:
1” this relaxation process” in the abstract is confusing. The authors should give a clear statement.
2 “This could easily explain the constant and less frequency dispersion below T1.” This sentence
is also the same problem woth comment 1.
3 For the figures, they should be improved, such as fig.1, the red background is not suitable for
the print copies.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers comments
concerning our manuscript entitled “Doping induced dielectric
anomaly below the Curie temperature in molecular
ferroelectric diisopropylammonium bromide ” (ID:
label_version_2
RSOS-181397). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for
revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied the comments
carefully and have made corrections which we hope meet with
approval. Revised portions are marked in red in the paper. The main
corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments
are as following:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer: 1
Comment 1:” this relaxation process” in the abstract is confusing. The
authors should give a clear statement.
Response: “This relaxation process” has been replaced with “this
dielectric anomaly” to make the statement more clear. The sentence
has been changed as “It is assumed that this dielectric anomaly can be
attributed to the freezing of ferroelectric domain walls induced by the
pinning of point defects.”
Comment 2: “This could easily explain the constant and less
frequency dispersion below T1.” This sentence is also the same
problem with comment 1.
Response: The sentence has been changed as “This could easily
explain that the dielectric constant hardly changes with temperature
and have less frequency dispersion below T1.”
Comment 3:For the figures, they should be improved, such as fig.1,
the red background is not suitable for the print copies.
Response: The figures we prepared is white background. The red
background may be caused by some upload error. We have checked
the upload files to make sure the backgrounds are white.
Reviewer: 2
Comment 1:Page 3, line 19. Which peak corresponds to the plane
(200)? So please add all the plane index in the XRD pattern.
Response: The PXRD figure has been changed as the following. The
main XRD peaks’ plane index and the calculated positions of pure
DIPAB have been added in the manuscripts.
Fig. 3 Temperature dependence of PXRD. The inset is the
enlarged parts from 24.7o to 25.7o. The short vertical bars indicate
the calculated positions of pure DIPAB.
Comment 2: Page 3, line 47. This manuscript provide only the
experimental results of C6H16NBr0.76Cl0.24 (DIPAB-C1). How to
conclude the “the dielectric anomaly is closely related with the doping
content”. So please add some experimental results of other
compositions with different x value.
Response: Temperature dependent dielectric constant of
C6H16NBr1-xClx (x=0.024, 0.062, 0.41, 0.60) have been added in the
supporting information (Fig. S3-Fig. S6). The statements has been
modified as “In addition, when the doping chlorine content x is low,
the change ratio of the dielectric constant is small around T1. Fig.
S3-S6 shows the dielectric constant curves when x=0.024, 0.062, 0.41,
0.60. The dielectric constant increases at 500 Hz by 7.6%, 25%, 521%,
428%, and 160% in the vicinity of T1 when x=0.024, 0.062, 0.24, 0.41,
and 0.60, respectively. Therefore the dielectric anomaly is closely
related with the doping content. At low doping level, the defects
density will increase with the doping content increase. The increased
doping level will make freezing process more clear.”
Comment 3:Page 3, line 49. Please check the word is “nothing” or
“noting”.
Response: The mistake has been corrected. The word should be
“noting”.
