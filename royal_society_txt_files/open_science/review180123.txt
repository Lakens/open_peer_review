Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors present a new approach for the construction of supramolecular DNA structures,
where the assembly mechanism is pH-sensitive. The idea is interesting and the underlying
science appears to be sound. The paper contains a few English language errors.
Some additional details and/or clarification are needed in places, as described below. In my view
the manuscript should be accepted for publication after minor revisions to address the following
points.
1. The authors did not cite a paper they published previously in this journal (‘Construction of a
junction DNA nanostructure and modulation of the junction switching to quadruplexes’, Cao et
al., R. Soc. Open Sci., 2017, DOI: 10.1098/rsos.171337). In my opinion, the authors should cite that
work and compare the nanostructure assembly mechanism it describes with that presented in this
manuscript.
2. Fig. 2F does not have a caption.
3. For readers (like me) who are not experts in mass spectrometry, it would be helpful if the
authors could elaborate briefly on the interpretation of the spectra presented in Fig. 2. For
example, what are [D1]^{3-} and [2M]^{3-} ions?
4. The description of the assembly mechanism should be enhanced to make it easier to
understand what is happening.
a. I found the paragraph at the end of the introductory section a bit confusing. Can the authors
revise this? I think it would be helpful if they could move Fig. 3 to this part of the manuscript and
discuss the assembly mechanism here. The term ‘duplex’ should be used with care, as it may not
be immediately obvious whether this refers to a standard B-form double helix or an unusual
Type-II DNA structure.
b. In Fig. 3, it is initially difficult to see which duplexes are standard B-form DNA and which are
the unusual Type-II structure. Can the authors modify the figure slightly to clarify this? Arrows
showing the strand direction would also help.
5. Can the authors elaborate on the interpretation of Fig. 4C? I’m not sure exactly what this data
shows. Also, should there be a plot for the combined sample at pH4.5?
6. Gels, Fig. 4D/E. I think the authors should briefly discuss the bands at the very bottom of the
gel (below 20bp).
7. I was not able to assess any supporting data in the Dryad repository as the DOI did not appear
to work. A supplementary information file was provided as part of the manuscript submission.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this manuscript the authors reported the investigation of DNA strands to construct
supramolecular size-controlled DNA nanostructures via pH values. The prepared self-assembled
composite materials were characterized using CD, AFM, et al. Some interesting results are
obtained. The introductions of thymine linkers within DNA nanostructures seem necessary to
maintain the stability of long sized nanostructures. The results seem to new support for
constructing new self-assembly nanostructures to develop promising DNA-based composite
materials. I think it can be accepted after minor revisions.
Q1. Fig. 2 and photos in Fig.4, the image resolution should be improved;
Q2. Introduction part, if possible, some important and relative reports about self-assembled
dipeptide nanostructures or composites about circularly polarized light should be added to show
clear film background, such as the following literatures;

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have responded comprehensively to almost all of the comments I made, but there are
still three very minor matters that I feel should be addressed before publication.
1. The arrows added to Figure 2 are very difficult to see and a bit unclear. I suggest putting
arrowheads on the DNA strands themselves and removing the arrows next to the structures.
2. With reference to my previous comment number 6: I do not quite understand the clarification
about the bands at the very bottom of the gel. Do the authors simply mean that these bands
correspond to single-stranded DNA oligos that have not been incorporated into any higher order
structures? If so, the phrase 'long strands' is misleading - they are actually 'short strands'!
3. Re supporting data: The authors say they have provided all supporting data in the ESI but I do
not appear to have access to this file. As I understand it, 'supporting data' means the raw data
files, for example spreadsheets containing columns of numbers, which can be processed by other
researchers. Will this data be available in the ESI? If not, the editor will need to confirm whether
8
such data is required before publication.

NOTE: The revised contents in the manuscript were labeled in RED. Our responses
were written in BLUE just after each comment (BLACK) of the reviewers. The
revised content of manuscript was briefly shown following our response.
Responses to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer 1:
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present a new approach for the construction of supramolecular DNA
structures, where the assembly mechanism is pH-sensitive. The idea is interesting and
the underlying science appears to be sound. The paper contains a few English
language errors.
Some additional details and/or clarification are needed in places, as described below.
In my view the manuscript should be accepted for publication after revisions to
address the following points.
1. The authors did not cite a paper they published previously in this journal
(‘Construction of a junction DNA nanostructure and modulation of the junction
switching to quadruplexes’, Cao et al., R. Soc. Open Sci., 2017, DOI:
10.1098/rsos.171337). In my opinion, the authors should cite that work and compare
the nanostructure assembly mechanism it describes with that presented in this
manuscript.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion. We have cited this paper, and an introduction about
this paper was added in the Introduction section.
In the Introduction section:
“Also, a junction DNA nanostructure has been successfully built in lithium acetate
buffer solution at a near-neutral pH value via the connection of two slipped junction
structures that are formed by G-rich and C-rich strands. The GC-rich duplex
junctions in the nanostructure can be switched to G-quadruplexes and i-motifs in
weakly acidic potassium acetate solution, which leads to the formation of DNA
nanostructures composed of alternating quadruplex and duplex DNA structures [22].”
2. Fig. 2F does not have a caption.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion. We have added a caption for Fig. 2F. According to
the comment 4, we have changed the position of Figure 2 in the article, and it is
Figure 3 now.
“The melting processes of S1-CS1 mixtures in KOAc buffer solution at pH 4.5 (F1)
and pH 9.0 (F2).”
3. For readers (like me) who are not experts in mass spectrometry, it would be
helpful if the authors could elaborate briefly on the interpretation of the spectra
presented in Fig. 2. For example, what are [D1]^{3-} and [2M]^{3-} ions?
Response:
Thank you for your comment. Based on your valuable suggestions, we have added a
brief introduction on how electrospray ionization mass spectrometry can direct the
assembly of oligonucleotides in the introduction section and added the interpretation
of each peak at the end of Fig. 3 caption as shown in below.
A brief introduction in “Introduction section”,
“Previously, we have demonstrated that electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) is a powerful tool for monitoring stoichiometry of
DNA complexes associated by various strands [3, 21, 22, 26] since soft
ionization technique of ESI is able to maintain noncovalent interactions of
inter-molecules during their transfer from solution to the gas phase. By using
ESI-MS we can obtain accurate information on association preference of
G-rich and C-rich DNA strands in various solution conditions [26] and have
built a novel DNA nanostructure with both G-quadruplex and i-motif based on

The revised caption of Fig.3,
“Figure 3. Mass spectra of self-association of S1 in pH 4.5 NH4+ (A) and in pH

4. The description of the assembly mechanism should be enhanced to make it easier
to understand what is happening.
a. I found the paragraph at the end of the introductory section a bit confusing. Can
the authors revise this? I think it would be helpful if they could move Fig. 3 to this
part of the manuscript and discuss the assembly mechanism here. The term ‘duplex’
should be used with care, as it may not be immediately obvious whether this refers to
a standard B-form double helix or an unusual Type-II DNA structure.
b. In Fig. 3, it is initially difficult to see which duplexes are standard B-form DNA
and which are the unusual Type-II structure. Can the authors modify the figure
slightly to clarify this? Arrows showing the strand direction would also help
Response:
Thank you for your valuable comments. According to your suggestions we have
revised the last paragraph of the introduction section, moved the Fig. 3 (now Fig. 2)
into this section, and gave more detailed on the designation of the DNA strands and
the interpretation of the structures presented in Fig. 2. We also have added arrows
into the fig. 2 to make the image much clear and use II-DNA and B-DNA to distinct
two different duplexes throughout whole article. The revision is shown below.
At the end of “Introduction section”,
“In this work, we attempted to construct G-quadruplex-based supramolecular
nanostructures and regulate the assembly of the nanostructures by connecting a
specific 5'-(CGA)n sequence which can form pH-dependent DNA duplex. To this end,
four DNA strands were first selected: 1) 5'CGACGA 3' (S1), 2) 5'TCGTCG 3'(CS1),
3) 5'AGCAGC 3'(S2), 4) 5'GCTGCT 3'(CS2) (Table 1), where S1 is a special
sequence forming self-associated II-DNA duplex in acidic condition; S2 has the same
base composition as S1 but different base order; S1 and CS1, S2 and CS2 are
complementary sequences forming B-type double helixes, respectively. We used
ESI-MS, circular dichroism (CD) and UV spectrometer to confirm the conformations
formed by the sequences and their mixtures. Following, we used the sequence d(G6)
to link S1 and CS1, S2 and CS2, which formed the sequences
d(CGACGAG6AGCAGC) (SG1) and d(GCTGCTG6TCGTCG) (CSG1), respectively;
and used d(T2G6T2) to link S1 and S2, CS1 and CS2 which formed the sequences
d(CGACGATTG6TTAGCAGC) (SG2) and d(GCTGCTTTG6TTTCGTCG) (CSG2),
respectively (Table 1). Thus the strands SG1, SG2, CSG1 and CSG2 contained
consecutive six Gs in the center were supposed to form stable parallel tetramolecular
G-quadruplex core in KOAc buffer solution (Figure 2A B C and Figure S1A-F) [26].
Specifically, SG2 could form a G-quadruplex dimer (Figure 2A) connected by
II-DNA structure of 5'-(CGA)n sequences at pH 4.5, and a mixture of SG2 and CSG2
(at a molar ration of 1: 1) could generate a G-quadruplex tetramer in acidic solution
(Figure 2D). In alkaline solution, the mixture would form DNA supramolecular
nanostructures with alternating G-quadruplex and B-DNA structure of 5'-(CGA)n
sequences (Figure 2E). This pH-dependent self-assembly properties should be
ascribed to the presence of 5'-(CGA)n that can form II-DNA at acidic pH, but form
B-DNA at basic pH. Furthermore, the pH-governed structural transition between
G-quadruplex tetramer and the DNA supramolecular nanostructures were also
investigated.”
The revised caption of Figure 2,
“Figure 2. Schematic drawings of postulated DNA supramolecular
nanostructures D and E formed by mixing SG2 and CSG2 in KOAc buffer
solution at pH 4.5 and 9.0, respectively. The A and C are formed by SG2
sequence d(CGACGATTG6TTAGCAGC) in KOAc buffer solution at pH 4.5
and pH 9.0, respectively, while B is formed by CSG2 sequence
d(GCTGCTTTG6TTTCGTCG) in KOAc buffer solution at both pH 4.5 and pH
9.0.”
5. Can the authors elaborate on the interpretation of Fig. 4C? I’m not sure exactly
what this data shows. Also, should there be a plot for the combined sample at pH 4.5?
Response:
Thank you for your comment. We have added an elaboration on the interpretation of
Fig. 4C in the text. And a plot for the samples at pH 4.5 in was also added as Figure
S4 in Supplementary Information.
“Figure 4C1 shows the CD spectra of the mixture of SG1 and CSG1, as well as
the mixture of SG2 and CSG2 at pH 9.0. Figure 4C2 shows the subtracted CD
spectrum obtained by subtracting the CD spectrum of the mixture of SG1 and
CSG1 from the CD spectrum of the mixture of SG2 and CSG2, which displays
the characteristic CD signatures of B-DNA, including a positive band at around
285 nm and a negative band at around 255 nm. The signature of B-DNA
supports the existence of a connection between G-quadruplexes and the
formation of supramolecular nanostructures. The addition of TT bases between
flanking residues (5' and 3') and six consecutive guanines could enhance the
flexibility within duplex and G-quadruplex structures during the formation of
duplex-connected DNA supramolecular nanostructures [21]. In addition, the
CD spectra also indicated a typical II-DNA structure when the mixture of SG2
and CSG2 was incubated at pH 4.5. All the above data suggested that
additional bases could provide flexible linkers for the intermolecular
interactions of 5'-[CGA]n sequences, which played a crucial role in
construction of DNA nanostructures.”
The added Figure S4 in Supplementary Information,
Figure S4. (A) CD spectra for SG2-CSG2 and SG1-CSG1 (30 µM) in a buffer
containing 30 mM KOAc at pH 4.5. (B) Subtracted CD spectrum obtained by
subtracting the CD spectrum of SG1-CSG1 from the CD spectrum of SG2-CSG2 in
Figure S4A.
6. Gels, Fig. 4D/E. I think the authors should briefly discuss the bands at the very
bottom of the gel (below 20bp).
Response:
According to your comment we have added a discussion about very bottom of the gel
(below 20 bp).
“The bands at the very bottom of the gel (near and below 20 bp) in Figures 4D
and 4E mean the existence of single- and double-stranded DNA formed by
long strands.”
7. I was not able to assess any supporting data in the Dryad repository as the DOI did
not appear to work. A supplementary information file was provided as part of the
manuscript submission.
Response:

Reviewer 1:
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have responded comprehensively to almost all of the comments I made,
but there are still three very minor matters that I feel should be addressed before
publication.
1. The arrows added to Figure 2 are very difficult to see and a bit unclear. I suggest
putting arrowheads on the DNA strands themselves and removing the arrows next to
the structures.
Response:
Thank you for your comments and suggestions. We have changed the position of the
arrows in Figure 2 and make it clearer to see. The revised Figure 2 is shown below.
Figure 2
2. With reference to my previous comment number 6: I do not quite understand the
clarification about the bands at the very bottom of the gel. Do the authors simply
mean that these bands correspond to single-stranded DNA oligos that have not been
incorporated into any higher order structures? If so, the phrase 'long strands' is
misleading - they are actually 'short strands'!
Response:
Thank you for your comment. You are wright. The very bottom of the gel means
should be bands of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA oligos that have not
been incorporated into any higher order structures. The sentence has been revised to
make it clear.
The sentence before revision
“The bands at the very bottom of the gel (near and below 20 bp) in Figures 4D and
4E mean the existence of single- and double-stranded DNA formed by long strands.”
The sentence after revision
“The bands at the very bottom of the gel (near and below 20 bp) in Figures 4D and
4E mean the existence of single- and double-stranded DNA formed by short strands
that have not been incorporated into supramolecular nanostructures.”
3. Re supporting data: The authors say they have provided all supporting data in the
ESI but I do not appear to have access to this file. As I understand it, 'supporting data'
means the raw data files, for example spreadsheets containing columns of numbers,
which can be processed by other researchers. Will this data be available in the ESI? If
not, the editor will need to confirm whether such data is required before publication.
