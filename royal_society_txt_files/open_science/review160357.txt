In this manuscript the authors make a strong case that increasing repertoire complexity is
coupled with more regularity in recurrence of song motifs/phrases. The approach is highly
creative and sets a standard for quantitative analyses that will be useful for future studies of
repertoire complexity. The data are clear and the interpretation is careful and does not overreach.
Some small issues and suggestions follow:
General: Does the duration of recording (varies from 5 minutes to one hour) influence the
assessment of how rich the repertoire is? If so, this would affect repertoire richness.

This manuscript presents a novel method for investigating and analysing the complexity and
structure of bird song performances. I think it’s a valuable approach that will be particularly
useful for species whose singing styles are not amenable to more traditional measurement and
analysis techniques. While I appreciate the value of the analysis and results, I found the
interpretation of the results somewhat frustrating, and my comments focus mainly on this.
However, I acknowledge that I may be approaching the material from a different disciplinary
background than that of the intended audience.
My main comments to the authors are as follows:
-The abstract, introduction and discussion focus on how the results relate to perception and
music. This is interesting material, but the emphasis on one particular interpretation (that birds
are “regulating” their performances to achieve balance) does not seem to be well-supported from
an ecological perspective. I don’t object to the idea of intention on the birds’ part, but hypotheses
concerning the benefit(s) of achieving balance - deliberately or not - are mentioned only in
passing and somewhat dismissively. I found reference to the huge body of existing research on
bird song (repertoire structure, performance diversity and complexity, functions of song) to be
very superficial - surprising given that there are a number of potential functional hypotheses
consistent with the results.
I would prefer to see the correlative pattern allowed to stand “on its own” as an interesting result,
which would require much more neutral wording in several places. From that neutral standpoint,
the result could be considered in a psychological and/or ecological context.
If the aim is to focus primarily on a comparison of butcherbird song with other forms of music
and/or potential benefits of regularity to receivers, I would like to see the discussion provide
more detail to place the butcherbird results in that context. If the manuscript also aims to discuss
the results in terms of the functions of bird song, there is plenty of scope for expansion.
-Regardless of the ultimate focus of the paper, it is likely to be read by researchers interested in
bird song from an ecological perspective. For these readers, a few additions to the methods and
results will be very helpful. For example, I suggest providing information on repertoire sizes for
the sampled birds (both in terms of phrase types and motifs), clarification of how the spike-
sorting phrase type classification method compares with more “traditional” methods for
determining repertoire size, and information on how similar phrase types needed to be in order
to qualify as “matches.”
-The reference list needs some attention, as information is missing from several items and the
formatting is inconsistent.
-I have made additional comments directly on the PDF of the manuscript. (See Appendix A.)

This paper aims to quantify musical properties of Pied Butcherbird songs and then correlate
features associated with song complexity and repetition. The conclusion states that complexity
and repetition are balanced, so that greater complexity is also typically associated with greater
repetition — presumably to aid song analysis by the birds.
The first part of the study, quantifying musicality in the songs, is very novel (and also difficult to
follow). This is a very hard problem and the authors seem to contribute significantly to the
methods for such analysis — especially to analyzing tempo. I believe they were successful with
this. It should be noted, however, that the assignment of “motifs” is still ultimately subjective.
The data and statistical analysis was troubling. The sample size of birds is small, and there is
practically no information provided about the birds who provided the recordings — simply
“Cohort 1” and “Cohort 2”. Butcherbirds have a wide distribution in Australia, with several
races. Times of the mating cycle of recording were not mentioned. Might such source differences
have been responsible for the trade-offs hypothesized? I do not know, but certainly they might
have, based on what is reported. What about age differences in the singers? These are known to
be important in other singers, such as Northern Mockingbirds, where erroneous correlations
were later found to result from age differences. This is touched on in p9, but not to the extent
warranted, in my opinion. I do not see how the claims about balancing complexity can be
evaluated without this basic information.
I felt uncomfortable with some of the statistical analysis, especially with the comparisons of
coefficients of variability (CV) in Table 4. I am not a statistician, but CVs would seem to be more
like variances than means, so that the test statistics that are used should more closely resemble F
distributions than t-distributions. This difference might help to explain some of the features
reported in Figure 4 that do not look to me to be significant, even though reported as such.
Possibly a bootstrap or other statistical learning technique would make this more convincing. I
could not find the data for this part of the paper to redo the analysis on my own. I repeat,
however, that I am not a professional statistician.
In spite of my admiration for the first part of the paper, where musicality was measured, given
my uncertainty with the collection metadata and basic statistical analysis it was difficult for me to
critically evaluate the later claims in the paper.

Temporal regularity increases with repertoire complexity in the Australian pied butcherbird’s
song
This study examines the relationship between vocal complexity and temporal regularity in the
complex songs of pied butcherbirds. The authors found a positive correlation between vocal
complexity and regularity where complex songs were sung in a more regular manner than
simpler songs.
General comments:
The study is quite interesting and writing is clear and understandable. It includes some novel and
complex methods that compare vocal complexity and regularity across butcher bird songs.
Admittedly, I found it hard to understand the fine details of these methods and how exactly they
extracted information from recordings, but I think I understood the general gist of what was
being done. The authors do a good job at broadly explaining their approach using explanation,
examples, and diagrams. Given my limited experience with these types of analyses however, I
probably am not in a position to be able to provide a thorough critique of their appropriateness
here or catch any errors. The findings of the study are not too surprising and complement much
of the research showing that bird songs are very structured acoustic signals.
Similar to Reviewer 2 in the previous submission, I come from an ecology background and my
interests in avian acoustic communication are probably not aligned with those of the authors.
Although I do appreciate the authors making a case regarding the similarity between the
structure of bird song and human music and feel that there is some value in the comparison, I
personally would be more interested in seeing how their findings relate to other studies that have
examined the functional importance of syntax in avian vocal communication. This is more of a
suggestion rather than necessity. Some examples of published studies include:
9
Balaban, E. (1988). Bird song syntax: learned intraspecific variation is meaningful. Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, 85(10), 3657-3660.
Suzuki, T. N., Wheatcroft, D., & Griesser, M. (2016). Experimental evidence for compositional
syntax in bird calls. Nature communications, 7.
I would like to see some type of performance measure (or at least comparability with other more
traditional classification methods) for the authors’ automated and semi-automated methods. For
example, a simple approach may be to compare how well these methods clustered similar song
components by comparing these components’ acoustic characteristics such as their duration,
pitch, frequency range, frequency modulation, and entropy etc. Perhaps even some quantification
of how well these clustering algorithms correspond to human-based classification (though this is
less objective than the previous suggestion). Indeed, some measurement of agreement with other
more commonly used methods would be very helpful (especially given the novelty of the
authors’ methods).
It is very important to note that because the authors did not sample the full repertoire of each
bird, nor quantified variation across different song bouts from the same bird over multiple
sampling periods, they are not comparing differences between individual birds, but rather
between different recordings or singing bouts (which happened to be given by different
individual birds). Therefore, the level of comparison made here is not between individual birds,
but between individual recordings (or song bouts). This needs to be clearly stated in the
manuscript, and may call for some adjustment in the way several statements are phrased (some
e.g. Pg 16 Ln 22-23; Pg 18 Ln 20; Pg 19 Ln 2; Pg 19 ln 17). Although the authors show that in
general more complex song bouts have a greater temporal regularity, given their limited dataset
they cannot test or show this at an individual bird level. This in turn should also put to rest any
concerns regarding the lack of information on bird age and the differences in recording duration.
Specific comments:
Note: My comments use page numbers added by the submission process in the top right corner
and the larger line numbers which I think are from the original submitted document.
Background:
Add Latin name for the pied butcherbird.
Pg 13.
Ln 2-4: I would perhaps cite sources for the claims of their singing virtuosity. I would also
perhaps simplify this and clearly state what you mean exactly by “singing virtuosity”. Did you
mean they have long complex songs etc.?
Ln 8-9: “This tension between the appeal of regularity versus diversity…” -- To make it easier to
understand for a broader audience, I would perhaps rephrase this using discipline-specific
language, rather than poetically (e.g. The trade-off between regularity and diversity in
birdsong…).
Ln 10-12: It appears you have jumped from talking about birds to talking about humans
(reflection of our adaptive preference etc.) with no clear transition between the two different
points. This makes this a bit confusing to read as one doesn’t know whether you are talking about
birds or humans.
I would start a new paragraph at the end of Ln 8 and also change “music” to “human music”.
Indeed, the next few sentences appear to refer to human music and perception by humans.
10
Pg 14.
Ln 13: “long epochs” – I would use a more appropriate noun here.
Comma after (31, 32).
Ln 15: Did you mean to say “balances repertoire complexity and regularity”?
Discussion:
Pg 19.
Ln 17-18: I suggest repeating here your definition of “phrase” and “motif”.
Pg 20.
Ln 7: Increase.
Ln 13-14: Citations required here.
Ln 21-22: Add Latin names for Bengalese finches and canary.
Methods:
Pg 23.
Ln 5: 0.5-3kHz -- seems like quite a narrow acoustic window. Do butcherbird songs not go above
3kHz? Did you test whether this was an appropriate frequency range or is it just an assumption
based on observations? Please clarify.
“Goldwave noise reduction function to further reduce environmental background” – did this
function require any parameters or selection of noisy regions of the tracks? Please be more
specific here.
Ln 7: Did you use any specific Matlab Toolboxes? If so, please mention.
Pg 26:
Ln 6-7: Please provide more exact details about how these were shuffled. What was the
procedure?
Pg 27:
Ln 1-2: CVs values are between 0 and 1, for which linear statistically methods are usually not
appropriate. What is your justification for using linear methods such as paired t-tests here? Did
you check assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity?
Figures are a bit hard to read due to their small size. Hopefully the will be bigger in the final
version.
Figure 4 & 5: It’s difficult to distinguish the pane labels (A, B, C etc.) from the figure labels (Type
C etc.).

The Tables and Supplementary figures lack captions and explanations of what they show. Also,
there is no explanation in the Methods for how the MANOVA tests (in one of the tables) were
conducted.

less objective than the previous suggestion). Indeed, some measurement of agreement with other
more commonly used methods would be very helpful (especially given the novelty of the
authors’ methods).
It is very important to note that because the authors did not sample the full repertoire of each
bird, nor quantified variation across different song bouts from the same bird over multiple
sampling periods, they are not comparing differences between individual birds, but rather
between different recordings or singing bouts (which happened to be given by different
individual birds). Therefore, the level of comparison made here is not between individual birds,
but between individual recordings (or song bouts). This needs to be clearly stated in the
manuscript, and may call for some adjustment in the way several statements are phrased (some
e.g. Pg 16 Ln 22-23; Pg 18 Ln 20; Pg 19 Ln 2; Pg 19 ln 17). Although the authors show that in
general more complex song bouts have a greater temporal regularity, given their limited dataset
they cannot test or show this at an individual bird level. This in turn should also put to rest any
concerns regarding the lack of information on bird age and the differences in recording duration.
Specific comments:
Note: My comments use page numbers added by the submission process in the top right corner
and the larger line numbers which I think are from the original submitted document.
Background:
Add Latin name for the pied butcherbird.
Pg 13.
15
Ln 2-4: I would perhaps cite sources for the claims of their singing virtuosity. I would also
perhaps simplify this and clearly state what you mean exactly by “singing virtuosity”. Did you
mean they have long complex songs etc.?
Ln 8-9: “This tension between the appeal of regularity versus diversity…” -- To make it easier to
understand for a broader audience, I would perhaps rephrase this using discipline-specific
language, rather than poetically (e.g. The trade-off between regularity and diversity in
birdsong…).
Ln 10-12: It appears you have jumped from talking about birds to talking about humans
(reflection of our adaptive preference etc.) with no clear transition between the two different
points. This makes this a bit confusing to read as one doesn’t know whether you are talking about
birds or humans.
I would start a new paragraph at the end of Ln 8 and also change “music” to “human music”.
Indeed, the next few sentences appear to refer to human music and perception by humans.
Pg 14.
Ln 13: “long epochs” – I would use a more appropriate noun here.
Comma after (31, 32).
Ln 15: Did you mean to say “balances repertoire complexity and regularity”?
Discussion:
Pg 19.
Ln 17-18: I suggest repeating here your definition of “phrase” and “motif”.
Pg 20.
Ln 7: Increase.
Ln 13-14: Citations required here.
Ln 21-22: Add Latin names for Bengalese finches and canary.
Methods:
Pg 23.
Ln 5: 0.5-3kHz -- seems like quite a narrow acoustic window. Do butcherbird songs not go above
3kHz? Did you test whether this was an appropriate frequency range or is it just an assumption
based on observations? Please clarify.
“Goldwave noise reduction function to further reduce environmental background” – did this
function require any parameters or selection of noisy regions of the tracks? Please be more
specific here.
Ln 7: Did you use any specific Matlab Toolboxes? If so, please mention.
Pg 26:
16
Ln 6-7: Please provide more exact details about how these were shuffled. What was the
procedure?
Pg 27:
Ln 1-2: CVs values are between 0 and 1, for which linear statistically methods are usually not
appropriate. What is your justification for using linear methods such as paired t-tests here? Did
you check assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity?
Figures are a bit hard to read due to their small size. Hopefully the will be bigger in the final
version.
Figure 4 & 5: It’s difficult to distinguish the pane labels (A, B, C etc.) from the figure labels (Type
C etc.).
The Tables and Supplementary figures lack captions and explanations of what they show. Also,
there is no explanation in the Methods for how the MANOVA tests (in one of the tables) were
conducted.

ABSTRACT
2
3
4 Music maintains a characteristic balance between repetition and novelty. Here we report a similar balance in singing
5
6 performances of free-living Australian pied butcherbirds. Their songs include many phrase types. The more phrase types
7
8 in a bird's repertoire, the more diverse the singing performance can be. However, without sufficient temporal organization,
9
10 avian listeners may find diverse singing performances difficult to perceive and memorize. Do individual songbirds strike
11
12
a balance between the complexity of their repertoire and the temporal regularity of their singing performance? We found
13
14
15 that different phrase types often share motifs (notes or stereotyped groups of notes). These shared motifs reappeared in
16
17 strikingly regular temporal intervals across different phrase types, over hundreds of phrases produced without interruption
18
19 by each bird. We developed a statistical estimate to quantify the degree to which phrase transition structure is optimized
20
21 for maximizing the regularity of shared motifs. We found that transition probabilities between phrase types nearly
22
23 maximize regularity in the repetition of shared motifs, but only in birds of high repertoire complexity. The strong
24
25
correlation between repertoire complexity and motif regularity suggests that individual birds regulate the temporal
26
27
28 diversity of shared motifs in a manner that takes their repertoire complexity into account.

BACKGROUND
2
3
4 Many oscine songbirds learn and perform an impressive variety of songs. The European nightingale (Luscinia
5
6 megarhynchos), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), and pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis) have acquired
7
8 notoriety for their singing virtuosity. Song complexity can be advantageous in mating and in social interaction because it
9
10 can signify life experience (1), learning capabilities (2), and affiliation with a local culture of song dialects (3), in addition
11
12 to preventing habituation in female listeners (4,5). On the other hand, performing a large variety of song types may
13
14
increase the difficulty with which conspecific listeners memorize and evaluate them. Thus, it might be easier for birds to
15
16
17 produce (6), perceive (7,8), and remember (9) songs if their temporal patterning is structured (10,11). This tension
18
19 between the appeal of regularity versus diversity has an interesting parallel in music, which maintains a characteristic
20
21 balance between repetition and novelty (12–14). Tuning the levels of predictability can affect a listener’s behavioral state:
22
23 the appeal of repetition is a reflection of our adaptive preference for predictability (15,16), while moderate variability
24
25 elicits a behavioral state of increased arousal (11). In most musical compositions, repetition and variation are carefully
26
27
balanced, avoiding extremes that lead to habituation or overload (17–20). In this manner, balancing repetition and
28
29
30 variation in various parameters (e.g. rhythms, pitches, timbres) can affect emotions – creating expectation, anticipation,
31
32 tension, release, or surprise (21,22).
33
34
35
36 Might similar principles explain some of the structure of vocal performances in songbird species whose singing
37
38 behavior tends to be complex (23–26)? In the context of aggressive interactions among males, predictability in singing
39
40
behavior may signal the level of aggression in territorial dispute (27). But in the context of an uninterrupted singing
41
42
43 performance, balancing variability and predictability might be more complicated: performance diversity may demonstrate
44
45 virtuosity and prevent habituation, while regularity might assist the listener to recognize patterns. Proper balance could
46
47 therefore serve to affect the avian listener’s behavioral state. If this hypothesis is correct, then the level of temporal
48
49 regularity in singing behavior should be balanced against complexity: individual birds with larger song repertoires should
50
51 aim at higher temporal regularity, and vice versa.
52
53
54
55
56 Here, we investigated this question in free-living Australian pied butcherbirds. Their songs are ideal for studying
57
58 regularity across levels of song structure (28) because song units (notes, phrases) are both complex and easy to identify
59
60

1
(Figs. 1-2). Similar in sound to a piping flute, a cornet, or an organ (29), their songs have also inspired composers
2
3
4 (including Olivier Messiaen), who have referred to timbre, contour, gesture, rhythm, repetition, scales, and formal
5
6 structure (30) as meaningful parameters of butcherbird song. Musicians have also identified overlaps with the human
7
8 sense of musicality in the butcherbird’s development and recombination of melodic motifs (28). Figure 1 presents a
9
10 musical transcription of butcherbird phrases alongside sonograms and pitch false color bars of the same phrases. A motif,
11
12 common to several unique phrases is highlighted.
13
14
15
16
17 The putative melodic motifs in butcherbird song, which musical transcription appears to show, are good
18
19 candidates to test for balance between repertoire complexity and temporal regularity. To test if such motifs can be
20
21 identified through acoustic analysis, for each bird, we recorded and analyzed thousands of uninterrupted song syllables
22
23 from nocturnal solo performances of identified birds. These performances can span several hours, with a moderate
24
25 number of phrase types, and strong individual variability in song complexity (30). Using methods for visualizing and
26
27
analyzing regularity across the hierarchy of song structure over long epochs of performances (31,32) we automatically
28
29
30 classified song phrases into types, and detected shared motifs across these phrases. We then examined if individual birds
31
32 present their singing repertoire in a way that balances repertoire complexity.
33

38 RESULTS
39
40
We first performed an exploratory analysis in a cohort of 9 birds (cohort 1) and then confirmed our finding in a second
41
42
43 cohort of 8 birds (cohort 2):
44
45
46
47 Regularity over entire singing performances
48
49
50
51
Pied butcherbird solo nocturnal song consists of phrases lasting approximately 2.5 0.7 seconds, typically
52
53
54 followed by slightly longer silence intervals (28). These performances often include hundreds of phrases (Fig. 2A). To
55
56 examine an entire singing performance, we constructed time-course raster-plots, where each line represents a phrase and
57
58 color indicates the pitch of each syllable (Fig 1B). Looking at the singing performance of one bird over 25 minutes (Fig.
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 5 of 23 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2C), we see a fairly homogenous temporal regularity of repetitive patterns. We first tested if classifying phrases into types
2
3
4 can capture this regularity. Distinct phrase types characterized by a stereotyped sequence of notes are often apparent in the
5
6 pied butcherbird song. However, a more careful inspection reveals a continuum, where some ‘types’ appear to be closely
7
8 related, while others are not (30). We therefore implemented an automatic spike-sorting algorithm (33) to automatically
9
10 classify song phrases into types (Fig. 2D-F). We then sorted the raster plots according to those types, and continued
11
12 sorting and classifying within each type, until all variants of phrase types were grouped (Fig. 1D). The sorted raster plot
13
14
shows that the temporal regularity is, in fact, a homogeneous ‘mix’ of a rich repertoire of phrase types. We observed a
15
16
17 similar effect in all nine birds (Suppl. Fig. 1): the time course raster plot appears highly uniform, but the sorted raster plots
18
19 reveal several phrase types, with high variability in repertoire size across birds.
20
21
22
23 The sorted raster plots reveal why many phrase types appear to be closely related: many phrase types share groups
24
25 of notes, which we call shared motifs (Fig. 3 & Fig. 1). We identified motifs of similar features (duration, pitch and
26
27
Wiener entropy) across different phrase types. For example, the bird represented in Fig. 3B-D had a relatively simple
28
29
30 repertoire with only three main phrase types (A, B & C) and five motifs (1-5), where motif 1 is shared across two phrase
31
32 types A and B. This bird primarily sings A (1-2), B (1-3-4), and C (5). Shared motifs could be easily identified in the
33
34 sorted raster plots of all of the birds in our sample (Fig. 3, Suppl. Fig. 2). Therefore, temporal regularity can be judged
35
36 either at the level of phrases (i.e., if the bird repeats phrase types regularly), at the level of the shared motifs (i.e., if the
37
38 bird repeats motifs types regularly), or across these levels (i.e., if the temporal order of phrase types is ‘designed’ to
39
40
regularize the shared motifs).
41
42
43
44
45 Statistical regularity in phrase types vs. shared motifs
46
47
48
49 In cohort 1 (n=9 birds) we tested which of the two levels—phrase types or shared motifs—explains more
50
51 regularity over the entire singing performance of each bird. We measured the interval between the recurrences of each
52
53
phrase type by counting the number of phrases that occurred between two renditions of a phrase type (Fig. 4A-D).
54
55
56 Similarly, we measured the interval between recurrences of each motif type by counting the number of phrases that
57
58 occurred between two renditions of a motif (Fig. 4D-G). We then calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of those
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 6 of 23
1
intervals for each phrase and motif type as estimates of regularity (low CV indicating high regularity and high CV
2
3
4 indicating low regularity). Note that in both cases we used the same units (number of phrases in-between) to calculate the
5
6 CV.
7
8
9
10 Let us consider, for example, a hypothetical bird that sings four phrase types, A, B, C & D, with a single motif, i,
11
12 shared between phrase types A and B (Ai and Bi), but not in C or D. If singing performance is completely regular, say
13
14
ABCD, ABCD… then the intervals between phrase type renditions all equal four, and therefore the CVph=0. However, the
15
16
17 intervals for renditions of the shared motif i (AiBiCD AiBiCD Ai…) will alternate between one (for AiBi) and three (for
18
19 BiCD Ai), and therefore CVm=0.5. Another bird may sing irregularly at the level of phrase types, say ACADBDADBCBD,
20
21 but nonetheless completely regularly at the level of the shared motif (Ai C, Ai D, Bi D, Ai D, Bi C, Bi D). In this case
22
23 CVph=0.75 while CVm=0. To obtain a single (independent) measure for each bird for the temporal regularity in phrase
24
25 types and motif types, we normalized and pooled CVph across all phrase types (CV*ph) and across all motif types (CV*m)
26
27
produced by the bird. In sum, CV*ph and CV*m are scalar estimates which allow us to compare the temporal regularity
28
29
30 across phrase and motif types regardless of variance in their relative frequencies within or across birds.
31
32
33
34 For each bird, we calculated CV*ph and CV*m. We then shuffled phrase order randomly, and recalculated those
35
36 measures (Fig. 4H, J). Comparing observed vs. shuffled measures, we found that both phrase types (Fig. 4H) and motif
37
38 types (Fig. 4J) recur more regularly than would be expected by chance. However, the effect was much stronger at the
39
40
level of shared motifs (Fig. 4E-G, phrase types: mean CV*ph = 0.61, CV*ph [shuffled data] = 0.78, t(8) = 3.70, p = 0.006; shared
41
42
43 motifs: Mean CV*m = 0.52, CV*m [shuffled data] = 0.73, t(8) = 7.42, p = 0.0001). To further validate this effect we collected and
44
45 analyzed a new set of data from additional eight birds. Results confirmed regularity at the shared motifs level (Mean CV*m
46
47 = 0.57, CV*m [shuffled data] = 0.71, t(7) = 2.74 p = 0.03) but not at the phrase level (Mean CV*ph = 0.73, CV*ph [shuffled data] = 0.76,
48
49 t(7) = 0.53, p = 0.60). Analysis of variance across the two cohorts (Suppl. Table 1) confirmed no significant effect of
50
51 cohort and no interactions, allowing us to pool the results of those cohorts for further analysis. Across both cohorts motif
52
53
regularity was significantly higher than phrase regularity (Fig. 4I, Mean CV*ph – ph [shuffled data] = 0.10, CV*m - m [shuffled data] =
54
55
56 0.18, t(17) = 0.245, p = 0.03).

Estimating birds’ “efforts” to regulate performance of shared motifs
2
3
4
5
6 Given that temporal regularity was stronger at the level of shared motifs, we wanted to estimate the extent to
7
8 which the sequences of phrases produced by a bird facilitate temporal uniformity in shared motifs. In order to answer this
9
10 question we need to take the bird’s repertoire size into account: the more phrase types and share motif types a bird can
11
12 perform, the larger the range of temporal intervals it can produce, and therefore, the ‘potential’ for irregularity in
13
14
performing shared motifs is higher. We wanted to estimate the level of temporal regularity in performing shared motifs in
15
16
17 reference to this potential, which can be judged by the range of possible CV*m values that the bird’s singing repertoire can
18
19 generate. To be conservative, we kept the distribution (histogram) of phrase intervals unchanged, and also kept the
20
21 structure (and entropy) of transition probabilities between phrase types unaltered. Therefore, focusing on the pairwise
22
23 transition frequencies between phrase types produced by a bird (i.e., at the level of a first order Markov model, or
24
25 bigrams), we inquire as to what extent those pairwise transitions are optimized to increase motif temporal uniformity, that
26
27
is, to minimize the temporal variability in the production of shared motifs, CV*m.
28
29
30
31
32 Fig. 5A presents a hypothetical example of a bird singing three phrase types, A, B & C, with pairwise transition
33
34 probability of 80% from ! <U+2192> # and 20% from ! <U+2192> $. If we swap the odds (20% for ! <U+2192> # and 80% for ! <U+2192> $), CV*ph
35
36 must remain unchanged but CV*m may change if those song phrases share different motifs. Therefore, we can construct
37
38 two pairwise (bigram) Markov models, one for the original and one for the shuffled (permuted) phrase transitions.
39
40
41
Running those models, we generated synthetic phrase sequences, and computed synthetic CV*m values for each model.
42
43 Comparing the means of CV*m values obtained from each model, we can now judge if the original (bird’s) phrase
44
45 transition probabilities are organizing the shared motifs less or more regularly than the alternatives. In sum: we keep the
46
47 transition probabilities between phrases unaltered except for shuffling the identities of phrase types. These manipulations
48
49 keep CV*ph constant but may alter CV*m. Each one of these permutations is used to generate synthetic songs, and for
50
51 calculating a CV*m value. Across all the possible permutations, only one corresponds to the phrase transitions
[synth]
52
53
54
produced by the bird, CV*m [synth-bird], which we compare to values obtained from all other permutations CV*m [synth-permuted].
55
56 With this approach we tested to what extent the bird’s bigram rules for phrase transitions are ‘optimized’ for increasing
57
58 regularity at the level of shared motifs.

3
4 For each bird, we calculated the bigram transition matrix across all pairs of phrase types. We used that transition
5
6 matrix to generate synthetic phrase sequences, and compute CV*m [synth-bird], which is our baseline. We then performed 100
7
8 permutations of this matrix. For each permutation we computed CV*m [synth-permuted] (Fig. 5B). We then sorted them and
9
10 ranked among them the CV*m [synth-bird]. Figure 5C presents the results for one bird. The potential range for temporal
11
12 variability in shared motifs can be judged by the range of CV*m [synth-permuted] values, sorted from small to large. The bird’s
13
14
CV*m [synth-bird] is denoted as a black circle. A rank in the neighborhood of 50 would indicate chance level. Here, the rank is
15
16
17 4 (out of 100) indicates that the bird’s phrase syntax brings the temporal regularity of motif recurrence close to its
18
19 theoretical maximum. Note that the bird’s rank order is a direct probability estimate (p= 0.04) of how unique the
20
21 variability of the bird's performance is when compared to similarly complex song, with respect to the shared motifs.
22
23
24
25 Fig. 5D presents the results across all 17 birds. Each curve represents the entire range of CV*m [synth-permuted] for one
26
27
bird. We can see two effects: First, as expected, bird’s phrase transitions produced higher regularity in the temporal order
28
29
30 of motifs compared to its permutations (mean rank = 17.53, SD = 18.30, by sign test is significantly below the 50th
31
32 percentile, p = 0.00002). This result confirms that each bird’s transition probabilities between phrase types are ‘designed’
33
34 to achieve much more regularity in shared motifs than the permutations can commonly achieve. Note, however, that our
35
36 estimate includes only the regularity that can be captured using a first order Markov model. It captures much, but not all,
37
38 of the regularity in shared motifs produced by the singing behavior of the bird (Motifs: Mean CV*[synth-bird] = 0.58, CV*[bird]
39
40
= 0.54, t(16) = 2.44, p = .027).
41
42
43
44
45 Second, across birds we see a strong negative correlation between CV*m[synth-bird] and its rank (n=17, r=-0.679
46
47 p=0.003). That is, in birds where the range of variation (CV*m [synth-permuted]) is high, phrase transitions (CV*m [synth-bird]) are
48
49 exceedingly selective toward high regularity. Indeed, in the 12 birds where the potential range for variability was high
50
51 (0.5-0.9), the mean rank was very low, 7.5%, while in the five birds where the potential range for variability was low
52
53
(0.38-0.48), the mean rank was 41.5%, close to chance level. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that birds
54
55
56 take their repertoire complexity into account when adjusting the level of temporal regularity in their singing performance.

6 (Fig. 5E). We used the rank of the CV*m[synth-bird] among the permutations (CV*m [synth-permuted]) as an approximation of the
7
8 effort necessary to maintain each bird’s element regularity. We found a strong correlation between transitional complexity
9
10 and this effort (r=0.710, p=0.0014), confirming that birds with high song complexity tend to produce higher regularity in
11
12 shared motifs and vice versa.

15
16
17 DISCUSSION
18
19 We found that singing performances of individual pied butcherbirds show high temporal regularity. However,
20
21 most of this regularity is not in the phrase order, but in the repetition of motifs that are shared across phrase types. The
22
23 temporal regularity of those shared motifs appear to be balanced against variability: in birds with a rich repertoire, phrase
24
25 syntax was exceedingly optimized (ranked low for CV* among the permutations) to achieve temporal regularity of shared
26
27
song motifs, whereas in birds with a less complex repertoire, temporal regularity was much lower.
28
29
30
31
32 Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that birds should regulate the temporal diversity of dominant themes
33
34 in their singing performance in a manner that takes their repertoire size into account. However, we could not evaluate
35
36 perception and engagement of avian listeners, and therefore we cannot exclude alternative explanations at the levels of
37
38 production and memory. Further, we don't know the age and gender of the individual birds we recorded, which could also
39
40
explain the variability we observed. However, even if the regularity we observed can be explained by these more
41
42
43 straightforward factors, those are likely to have consequences at the receiver end. At minimum, we now have the tools at
44
45 hand to test if and how regularities in repetition and variations in singing performances may affect avian listeners beyond
46
47 the level of phrase types.
48
49
50
51 At least at the phenomenological level, the existence of a characteristic balance between repetition and variation is
52
53
an interesting link between birdsong and music. Perhaps each bird organizes its phrase order so as to return to any given
54
55
56 motif on a regular basis, possibly providing a sense of regularity for the listener. At the same time, the position of each
57
58 motif within the phrase in which it returns is variable, allowing for a flexible presentation and possibly maintaining a
59

listener’s interest. Such structure could allow for balance between regularity and variability so characteristic of music. A
2
3
4 future investigation of behavioral state in bird listeners could perhaps answer these fascinating questions.

8 CONCLUSIONS
9
10 To our knowledge, there is no universal correlation between complexity and repetition across musical cultures.
11
12 Statistical regularities in music can only rarely be collapsed across all musical cultures. For example, some composers
13
14
(e.g. Philip Glass) are famous for highly repetitive music. However, balance between repetition and variation is highly
15
16
17 abundant in music (within styles) and is one of the most studied universals in music (15,16,34–38). Though it is unlikely
18
19 to apply across all, we have demonstrated in one species of songbird that the overall repertoire complexity of the bird is
20
21 'balanced' by regularity in temporal structure. To our knowledge, such an effect was never observed in non-human
22
23 animals. We hope that our methods for high throughput analysis across entire singing performances of wild birds would
24
25 facilitate studies testing for similar effects in other species.

30 METHODS
31
32 Song recordings. The pied butcherbird singing performances were digitally recorded at a sample rate of 44100 kHz and
33
34 16 bits in Australia between 1992 and 2000, using a Sennheiser ME67 shotgun microphone covered with a Rycote
35
36 windshield, and a Sony portable high definition minidisc recorder. We restricted our analysis to recordings from 17 birds,
37
38 where background noise was low and the individual bird could be clearly identified for at least five minutes of continuous
39
40
singing behavior. Mean recording length per bird was 32 minutes, ranging from five minutes to one hour.
41
42
43
44
45
46
47 Sound data pre-processing. Each recording was pre-processed using Goldwave: we filtered the data using a bandpass
48
49 filter of 0.5-3kHz, and then used the Goldwave noise reduction function to further reduce environmental background
50
51 noise. Pied butcherbird phrases can were then identified by the 2-3 seconds pauses that separate between them (Fig. 2A).
52
53
Song phrases were saved into separate files, indexed by phrase temporal order, and were then analyzed using Matlab 8.

Unsorted & sorted raster-plots of entire singing performances. In order to inspect and quantify the entire singing
2
3
4 performance of each bird, we simplified the sonograms of phrases into a time course (vector) of pitch values, and
5
6 presented it as a false-color bar (Fig. 2B). We then stack those bars as rows on top of one another to produce raster plots
7
8 of entire singing performances (Fig. 2C), where each line represents a phrase, aligned by the onset of the first syllable.
9
10 The unsorted raster plots are stacked according to phrases in performance order (Fig. 2C, 2B, E). The sorted raster plots
11
12 (Fig. 2D, 2D, G) present phrases according to their type, which we calculate semi-automatically as described in the next
13
14
section. We developed a Graphic User Interface in Matlab [available at: http://locateflow.newmedialab.cuny.edu/online-
15
16
17 methods/], which allows us to point-and-click rearrangement of phrases vertically, as well as for playing phrases (in real
18
19 speed or slow motion) by clicking on each phrase type. We use these GUIs as descriptive models that could facilitate
20
21 perceiving those performances holistically, combining visual and auditory perception to detect similarities and differences
22
23 across all the phrase types produced by each bird.
24
25
26
27
Automatic classification of phrase types. We found that by the onset timing of syllables within a phrase is sufficient for
28
29
30 automatic classification of song phrases. We used a spike-sorting algorithm to automatically detect phrase types (i.e. we
31
32 treated each phrase as a point process with spikes representing syllable onsets). We sorted phrases into types and then
33
34 subtypes, using the following steps:
35
36 The phrase amplitude was normalized using the Matlab wavesc function.
37
38
39
40
We automatically identified syllable onsets by smoothing data, computing the amplitude derivative and
41
42
43 identifying local maxima. Local maxima above an empirically determined threshold were marked as syllable
44
45 onsets.
46
47
48
49 We converted the amplitude time course into a binary signal (sampled at 1000Hz) where syllable onsets were
50
51 labeled as 1, and all other time points as zero. We then treated those data as a point process for spike sorting, such
52
53
that the first syllable onset was assigned as the beginning of the phrase, to align the vectors.

We used the Spike Train Communities Toolbox for Matlab (33) to automatically classify the song phrases into
2
3
4 types. The spike-sorting algorithm then grouped phrases into categories (types) (Fig. 2D). We then reconstructed
5
6 the false-color map of the sorted phrases as shown in Fig 1D. Using a user interface (GUI) described above, we
7
8 inspected the clusters, and when needed, we further sorted them until all color bars were grouped.
9
10
11
12 Classification of motifs. The sorted false-color maps of song phrases facilitated visual identification of shared motifs,
13
14
which were reused in multiple phrase types. We successively identified motifs manually until all possible motifs had been
15
16
17 discovered.
18
19 A visual map was constructed using the methodology seen in Fig. 3D. Elements were defined as syllables or
20
21 syllable sequences that were found in multiple contexts (Fig. 3A, C, F) in different phrases. Repeated syllables, as in the
22
23 case of B in ABB, were treated as one motif (BB is a motif). However, if extended repetition was also found, as in ABBB,
24
25 then the more basic unit (here B can be added to BB) was identified as a motif (B is the motif).
26
27
We chose this top-down approach of motif classification because visual identification of syllables as a first step
28
29
30 had its own biases. Further, automated syllable classification was biased by thresholding and errors due to noise could
31
32 leave syllables misclassified. Classification of motifs was accomplished blind to phrase sequence patterning.
33
34 Each phrase could now be represented as a sequence of motif names (Fig. 3C). The phrases, represented as a
35
36 sequence of motifs, were entered into a spreadsheet and arranged according to the original singing order (one phrase per
37
38 row, one motif per cell). The spreadsheet data was imported into Matlab for analysis as a “motif matrix.”
39
40
41
42
43 Analysis of element distribution. To measure how consistently a motif was reused within a bird’s sequence of phrases,
44
45 we created a summary statistic to quantify the regularity in the distribution of inter-phrase intervals (IPIs, 3B) for all
46
47 motifs across each bird’s performance. We used coefficient of variation as a measure of uniformity in the distribution of
48
49 inter-phrase intervals (IPIs) from one appearance of a motif to its next appearance. We calculated IPIs for each motif and
50
51 divided each interval of that set by the mean of the IPIs for that motif and called this the “normalized set of IPIs” value for
52
53
each motif.

Then we calculated a CV value (SD/M) across the set of all normalized IPIs to gain a general sense of the level of
2
3
4 variability within a bird’s performance. This summary statistic will hereafter be simply referred to as CV*.

15 Statistical models. We used three statistical models in order to assess the temporal structure of phrases and motifs:
16
17 “Shuffled”, “Bigram Markov” and “Permuted Markov.”:
18
19
20
21
22 Shuffled Model. For each bird the rows of the motif matrix corresponding to their natural singing behavior were randomly
23
24 shuffled.
25
26
27
28 Bigram Markov Model. For each bird, transition probabilities between phrase types were calculated from the bird’s
29
30 natural singing order, Bigrams_Matrixbird. Using this matrix we generated synthetic strings as long as the birds
31
32
performance: After selecting a phrase at random to start the sequence, the remaining phrases were chosen based on the
33
34
35 transition probabilities from the original performance until the same number of phrases as the original performance had
36
37 been chosen. CV* was then calculated (Equation 3). We repeated this procedure 100 times, and computed the average
38
39 CV* value across all the bigram Markov sequences was chosen to represent the CV*[synth-bird] of a “bigram Markov” model.
40
41
42
43 Permuted Markov Model. We generated permutations of the Markov model by using the transition probabilities of the
44
45
original model but then permuting which phrases were assigned to which transitions (Fig. 5A). 100 permuted models were
46
47
48 used to represent the space of possibilities for alternate Markov models that still maintained basic structure of transition
49
50 probabilities. For each permutation 100 models were generated and an average CV*[synth-permuted] value was calculated for
51
52 each sequence generated by a new permutation (Fig. 5B).

Statistical Analysis. To compare the CV* achieved by a model with the CV* achieved by original singing behavior used a
2
3
4 paired t test. Each bird’s original CV* value was subtracted the CV* value generated by the model generated from that
5
6 bird’s data to provide a set of difference scores.
7
8 To estimate a correlation between ranks and CV*s of Markov models and ranks of CV* among permuted models
9
10 (see Fig. 5D) we used the bivariate correlation function in SPSS.
11
12
13
14
Complexity measures. To capture the complexity of each bird’s bigram Markov model we use the number of non-zero
15
16
17 elements in the associated Markov transition matrix. This corresponds to the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, which is
18
19 defined as the shortest instruction set, or 'program,' that can generate a sequence. In this case the transition matrix can
20
21 generate a sequence comparable to the one performed by the bird and the matrix elements are all that are required to
22
23 'execute the program'. The length of the program is given by the sequence describing the location and value of each
24
25 nonzero element in the matrix.

Appendix B
We thank the reviewers for their thorough and constructive comments, all of which
were addressed in the revised MS as elaborated below. We feel that the paper is
much improved. In particular, the new Discussion presets functional hypotheses and
ecological questions in details. The Methods now contain sufficient information
about the field recording, link to data repository, rationale of data analysis and a
clearer documentation of our statistical approaches.
Reviewer: 1
In this manuscript the authors make a strong case that increasing repertoire
complexity is coupled with more regularity in recurrence of song motifs/phrases.
The approach is highly creative and sets a standard for quantitative analyses that
will be useful for future studies of repertoire complexity. The data are clear and the
interpretation is careful and does not overreach.
We thank the reviewer for these kind words.
General: Does the duration of recording (varies from 5 minutes to one hour)
influence the assessment of how rich the repertoire is? If so, this would affect
repertoire richness.
Yes, this is likely. This is why we use only scale-invariant measures. For example,
when we assess repertoire size we do not simply count the number of phrase types,
but use the Kolmogorov complexity estimate, which is, by design, scale invariant.
We clarify this point in the statistical models, page 15 line 12.
Fig. 4H: It appears as if the CV of the shuffled set is overall higher (at least less
variable). This is confusing to me.
Yes, this is indeed confusing: the higher CV in the shuffled set indicates that the
phrases are more regular within each bird than expected by chance. The higher
variability across birds, and lower variability across the shuffled-birds data suggest
a similar effect to that we see at the level of shared motifs (Fig. 4J). We suspect that
birds with low repertoire size have less regular transitions at both phrase and motif
levels. Since the effect is much stronger at the motif level, we focused on it. We
revised the results (page 6, lines 26-27) to clarify this point.

Reviewer: 2
This manuscript presents a novel method for investigating and analysing the
complexity and structure of bird song performances. I think it’s a valuable approach
that will be particularly useful for species whose singing styles are not amenable to
more traditional measurement and analysis techniques. While I appreciate the value
of the analysis and results, I found the interpretation of the results somewhat
frustrating, and my comments focus mainly on this. However, I acknowledge that I
may be approaching the material from a different disciplinary background than that
of the intended audience.
We thank reviewer 2 for the useful suggestions and for very thorough and detailed
comments. We addressed them all and we feel that the manuscript is now much
improved. We would like the paper to be relevant and accessible to students of
birdsong across disciplines, regardless of our motivation to perform the study. We
made several changes throughout the MS to address this issue as elaborated below.
My main comments to the authors are as follows:
-The abstract, introduction and discussion focus on how the results relate to
perception and music. This is interesting material, but the emphasis on one
particular interpretation (that birds are “regulating” their performances to achieve
balance) does not seem to be well-supported from an ecological perspective.
To address this, we expanded the scope of the paper to present several alternative
mechanistic and ecological explanations to our results from a neutral standpoint, as
the reviewer suggested. We revised several parts of the MS and including pointers in
to alternative ecological explanations, which are now discussed in details. See
abstract: lines 12-14, Introduction page 4 lines 16-18, and the new discussion.
I don’t object to the idea of intention on the birds’ part,
Actually, we did not mean to make any claims about ‘intentions’. We now realize
that saying that the bird ‘takes it repertoire size into account when…’ was a
misleading statement and we removed it. All we want to suggest is that the results
suggest that birds possess a (neuronal) mechanism that regulates sequential order
of song elements, and that this mechanism is modulated by repertoire complexity.
We now present hypotheses for specific mechanistic explanations at different levels,
see pages 9-11.
but hypotheses concerning the benefit(s) of achieving balance - deliberately or not -
are mentioned only in passing and somewhat dismissively.
Alternative hypotheses are now presented systematically in the revised discussion.
I found reference to the huge body of existing research on bird song (repertoire
structure, performance diversity and complexity, functions of song) to be very
superficial - surprising given that there are a number of potential functional
hypotheses consistent with the results.
We expanded the literature review in the discussion and preset functional
hypotheses as suggested by the reviewer.
I would prefer to see the correlative pattern allowed to stand “on its own” as an
interesting result, which would require much more neutral wording in several
places. From that neutral standpoint, the result could be considered in a
psychological and/or ecological context.
We cannot be entirely neutral about our motivation, questions, and analysis, which
all stemmed from our interest in the musicality of the Pied Butcherbird song.
However, we do not want to bias the reader either. We added references to other
point of views in the end of the introduction, and presented several alternative
ecological and neuronal viewpoints in the new discussion.
If the aim is to focus primarily on a comparison of butcherbird song with other
forms of music and/or potential benefits of regularity to receivers, I would like to
see the discussion provide more detail to place the butcherbird results in that
context. If the manuscript also aims to discuss the results in terms of the functions of
bird song, there is plenty of scope for expansion.
Thanks for making this suggestion: We decided to focus on function, and to link
function to music theory where appropriate. Also, those alternative viewpoints are,
to a large extent complementary. Even according to the parallels between musical
balance and the pied butcherbird song that we propose, those should have both
functional and ecological implications. See points 1-3 in the new discussion.
-Regardless of the ultimate focus of the paper, it is likely to be read by researchers
interested in bird song from an ecological perspective. For these readers, a few
additions to the methods and results will be very helpful. For example, I suggest
providing information on repertoire sizes for the sampled birds (both in terms of
phrase types and motifs). Clarification of how the spike-sorting phrase type
classification method compares with more “traditional” methods for determining
repertoire size
We added an introductory paragraph to address this (page 13, line 22):
Automatic classification of phrase types. The classification of song repertoire in pied
butcher depends on the way phrase type is defined. If one defines a phrase as ‘stereotyped
core motif consisting of three or more notes, with variable beginnings and endings’, then the
majority of 27 birds analyzed in detail could be described as having repertoires of from 1 to
10 phrase types with an average of 5 (unpublished data Scharff & Taylor). The variations,
however, make it difficult to decide how much variation should be included within a phrase
type. An alternative definition of phrase is 'a unique occurrence of a string of notes that is
delivered multiple times in exactly the same way’, then the repertoire would range between
3 and 43 phrase types, with an average of 21 in the analyzed cohort of 27 birds. Our
automated method is based on this later definition. We used a hierarchical clustering
technique, called spike sorting, to automate the determination of types. Automated
clustering methods are fast objective, but not necessarily reliable or meaningful. We
therefore confirmed all the clustering results by visual inspection as shown below.
, and information on how similar phrase types needed to be in order to qualify as
“matches.”
We clarified this point in page 14, line 23:
This last stage, which is semi-automatic, was used to identify virtually identical phrase
types. Therefore, our criteria for defining phrase types is highly conservative, with each
‘variant’, no matter how minor, in order of syllables was classified as a distinct phrase type.
-The reference list needs some attention, as information is missing from several
items and the formatting is inconsistent.
Fixed.
-I have made additional comments directly on the PDF of the manuscript.
We addressed them all:
Page 5 line 29
Can you please provide some summary statistics for repertoire size (both phrase
types and motifs)?
Fixed, see page 14 line 1.
Page 7 line 12
This is a key factor to consider, which underlines the importance of clarifying how
phrase types were classified and repertoire sizes determined.
We clarified this. See page 14, line 23
Page 8 line 53
Or could it be that these are, for example, younger birds who have not yet fully
developed their ability to deliver complex performances? Or birds whose mating or
territorial status requires a qualitatively different type of performance than that of
the high-regularity birds?
Yes, the life experience of the bird (age, etc.) and its behavioral state (mating vs.
territorial context) should affect both the repertoire and the temporal regularity.
But we think that there is a non-trivial coupling between repertoire complexity and
temporal regularity. In many birdsong species the repertoire size increase with age.
However, recent studies show that the potential temporal complexity may also
increase with age: for example, across two species of song birds and human infants
(Lipkind et al, Nature 2013) transitions between syllables are acquired slowly over
development. So, to our knowledge, there is no known obvious or trivial explanation
to the correlation we observed. The revised discussion now presents pointers to all
those possible explanations and attempts to integrate across ecological, mechanistic,
perceptual and music theory considerations.
Page 9 line 31
Yes, but as you point out the results are also consistent with many other hypotheses
as well. These aren’t necessarily exclusive hypotheses, but some of the other options
have a clearer link to ecological function and sound “simpler” in a cognitive sense.
There’s a really interesting pattern here, with an exciting range of potential
explanations. The idea of “regulation” seems to be advocated pretty strongly in the
manuscript, but I don’t feel this is warranted. A stronger integration of the results
with the huge body of existing research on the function of diversity in bird song
would be really beneficial.
We agree. We do not want to advocate our hypothesis more than the data may
permit, but we still want to focus this paper on the question of musical balance. We
hope that the expanded discussion makes this paper more balanced.
Page 10 line 31
Time span for recordings suggests that it is unlikely birds were re-recorded, but can
this be confirmed? Were recordings collected at multiple location, and if so over
how wide a geographic range?
This is correct. We added a table with recording dates and duration (Table 1). Pied
butcherbirds are non-migratory, resident, and largely sedentary (P. J. Higgins, J. M.
Peter, and S. J. Cowling, eds. Handbook of Australian, New Zealand & Antarctic Birds.
Vol. 7A. Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 519). Of 877 banded
individuals, 158 recoveries saw 98.2% recovered <10km from the banding site
(ibid., p. 520). Our recordings were collected in four states ranging thousands of km
apart. The closest individuals are the Bardon and Indooroopilly birds, a distance of
10 km, followed by the Stuart/Ross Hwy in Alice Springs and the Ross River Resort
campground, a distance of 80 km. All others exceed 100 km in distance, making it
extremely unlikely that birds were recorded in another location (except the two
Nelly Bay recordings, which are assumed to be the same individual). This
information is now included in the Methods.
Page 10 line 40
Did the number of phrase types and/or motifs correlate with recording length? Are
you confident the full repertoire was captured for each bird?
This is a fair concern. Also, we know that butcherbirds keep modifying their songs
even across daily observations (unpublished results). This is why we use only scale-
invariant measures. For example, when we assess repertoire size we do not simply
count the number of phrase types, but use the Kolmogorov complexity estimate,
which is, by design, scale invariant. We clarify this point in the statistical models,
page 15 line 12.
Page 10 line 48
I don’t mind use of the word “phrase” rather than “song type” but you may want to
clarify whether you consider the terms to be interchangeable with regard to
butcherbird song. I generally think of “phrase” applying to performances that are
continuous (no noticeable pauses, making it difficult to break a stream of song into
components larger than individual syllables). Alternatively, I would use “phrase”
rather than “song type” when there was a lot of variation among performances of a
general pattern (always recognisable but not strictly stereotyped). Neither seems to
be the case here, but it’s not clear. Also worth including the term “song type” in the
text or keywords to insure your work is easy to find for bird song researchers who
prefer that term.
We think that our usage of the term phrase is similar to that of the reviewer. The
butcherbird phrases are variable, and in some respects continuous, because silences
are like mini-pauses, separating the phrases. The segmentation is therefore
incontrovertible, but the singing behavior is continuous. Although the phrases are
variable units, using the spike sorting we categorize them to non-variable ‘types’.
That is, we treat every variation as a distinct type. We think that this approach is
better, because it allows us to investigate temporal regularity at the level of shared
motifs more generally. We would like to keep the terminology of ‘phrase’ rather
than ‘type’ because we feel it is more appropriate for the singing ‘style’ of this
species. We clarified this point in the Methods.

“by the onset timing” - not clear what is meant here. Based on the following
description, it sounds like you mean: “the sequence of syllable onset times within
phrases, without regard to pitch, was sufficient automatic classification of song
phrases.”
We rephrased to “We found that by the onset time of syllables within each phrase”
Page 12 line 3
This still doesn’t really clarify how similar phrases needed to be in order to be classified as
the same type. Do you set parameters for the spike-sorting algorithm? If so, what
parameters were used?
We used the spike sorting code as is, without modification, using the default
parameters. We now clarified this explicitly in the text.
Page 12 line 6
Given that this seems to be a novel way of classifying phrase types, did you formally
compare the method with more commonly used techniques for identifying matching
phrase/song/syllable types? The manuscript states that the method was “sufficient”
but more detail would be helpful.
To our knowledge, there is no standard quantitative method for comparing
clustering approaches. However, we think that our graphical methods for displaying
the sorted raster plots is a robust qualitative approach for judging if the clustering is
good. In our view, no automated non-supervised clustering technique should be
trusted unless visually inspected and confirmed. But it is nevertheless useful
because it can efficiently and objectively process large datasets of songs.
Page 12 line 10
“all possible” ? Not clear what this means.
We rephrased this statement to “We successively identified motifs manually until all the
visually similar motifs had been grouped together.”. In other words, the spike sorting
detected clusters, which in some cases could be further sorted into sub-categories.
In those cases, we did the sub-division by sorting manually within the cluster. Such
semi-automatic supervision of clustering is not uncommon.
The reference formatting is all over the show, with several references missing
important information and others having superfluous information.
Fixed.

This paper aims to quantify musical properties of Pied Butcherbird songs and then
correlate features associated with song complexity and repetition. The conclusion
states that complexity and repetition are balanced, so that greater complexity is also
typically associated with greater repetition — presumably to aid song analysis by
the birds. The first part of the study, quantifying musicality in the songs, is very
novel (and also difficult to follow). This is a very hard problem and the authors seem
to contribute significantly to the methods for such analysis — especially to
analyzing tempo. I believe they were successful with this. It should be noted,
however, that the assignment of “motifs” is still ultimately subjective.
We thank the reviewer for these kind words and for the very useful comments,
particularly with respect to clarifying and improving the statistical methods. We
revised MS to describe our methods more clearly. We also provide more details to
clarify which parts of the analysis are completely automated or semi-automatic. The
identification of motifs is not entirely subjective: We indeed started by subjective
visually guided sorting of candidate motifs, but we then inspected all their acoustic
features side-by-side to confirm that they are virtually identical across phrases
across all their acoustic features. We took a very conservative approach and
considered as ‘motifs’ only cases where we failed to detect any deviation in any
acoustic feature. See page 15, lines 1-6.
The data and statistical analysis was troubling. The sample size of birds is small, and
there is practically no information provided about the birds who provided the
recordings — simply “Cohort 1” and “Cohort 2”.
We now clarify this point, see opening paragraph of the Results. In order to avoid
statistical biases, given the difficulties of collecting behavioral data from wild birds,
and the novelty of our methods, we randomly divided our data into two sets
(cohorts). The first cohort was used for exploration (cohort 1). The second cohort
was used only for testing hypotheses based on exploration of cohort 1. Only in figure
5 we presented data across the two cohorts in a single panel, but we used different
markers to make them visually distinct.
Butcherbirds have a wide distribution in Australia, with several races. Times of the
mating cycle of recording were not mentioned. Might such source differences have
been responsible for the trade-offs hypothesized? I do not know, but certainly they
might have, based on what is reported.
We added a table with recording locations and date and included the subspecies
(see Table 1). We did not identify any differences in measures of singing behavior
across sub-species:
What about age differences in the singers? These are known to be important in
other singers, such as Northern Mockingbirds, where erroneous correlations were
later found to result from age differences. This is touched on in p9, but not to the
extent warranted, in my opinion. I do not see how the claims about balancing
complexity can be evaluated without this basic information.
We do not know the age or the sex or the breeding state of the singers. Both age and
life experience are likely to affect song complexity and the temporal regularity. This
is now discussed in details in the discussion, page 10 (point 1). The revised
discussion now includes a systematic review of all the alternative hypotheses.
I felt uncomfortable with some of the statistical analysis, especially with the
comparisons of coefficients of variability (CV) in Table 4. I am not a statistician, but
CVs would seem to be more like variances than means, so that the test statistics that
are used should more closely resemble F distributions than t-distributions. This
difference might help to explain some of the features reported in Figure 4 that do
not look to me to be significant, even though reported as such. Possibly a bootstrap
or other statistical learning technique would make this more convincing.
Following the reviewer advice we performed a bootstrap test, and results are
consistent with our previous analysis:
I could not find the data for this part of the paper to redo the analysis on my own. I
repeat, however, that I am not a professional statistician. In spite of my admiration
for the first part of the paper, where musicality was measured, given my uncertainty
with the collection metadata and basic statistical analysis it was difficult for me to
critically evaluate the later claims in the paper.

This study examines the relationship between vocal complexity and temporal regularity in the complex
songs of pied butcherbirds. The authors found a positive correlation between vocal complexity and
regularity where complex songs were sung in a more regular manner than simpler songs.
General comments:
The study is quite interesting and writing is clear and understandable. It includes some novel and
complex methods that compare vocal complexity and regularity across butcher bird songs. Admittedly, I
found it hard to understand the fine details of these methods and how exactly they extracted
information from recordings, but I think I understood the general gist of what was being done. The
authors do a good job at broadly explaining their approach using explanation, examples, and diagrams.
Given my limited experience with these types of analyses however, I probably am not in a position to be
able to provide a thorough critique of their appropriateness here or catch any errors. The findings of the
study are not too surprising and complement much of the research showing that bird songs are very
structured acoustic signals.
>> We thank the reviewer for these kind words
Similar to Reviewer 2 in the previous submission, I come from an ecology background and my interests
in avian acoustic communication are probably not aligned with those of the authors. Although I do
appreciate the authors making a case regarding the similarity between the structure of bird song and
human music and feel that there is some value in the comparison, I personally would be more interested
in seeing how their findings relate to other studies that have examined the functional importance of
syntax in avian vocal communication. This is more of a suggestion rather than necessity. Some
examples of published studies include:
Balaban, E. (1988). Bird song syntax: learned intraspecific variation is meaningful. Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, 85(10), 3657-3660.
Suzuki, T. N., Wheatcroft, D., & Griesser, M. (2016). Experimental evidence for compositional syntax in
bird calls. Nature communications, 7.
>> We agree. We added those references to the revised MS.
I would like to see some type of performance measure (or at least comparability with other more
traditional classification methods) for the authors’ automated and semi-automated methods. For
example, a simple approach may be to compare how well these methods clustered similar song
components by comparing these components’ acoustic characteristics such as their duration, pitch,
frequency range, frequency modulation, and entropy etc. Perhaps even some quantification of how well
these clustering algorithms correspond to human-based classification (though this is less objective than
the previous suggestion). Indeed, some measurement of agreement with other more commonly used
methods would be very helpful (especially given the novelty of the authors’ methods).
>> We figured out very early in the analysis that simple measures such as phrase duration and mean
phrase features (such as mean pitch) do not work. Those songs are simply too complex and the re-
usage of shared elements made it impossible to implement any simple classification method, such as the
ones we routinely used in our Sound Analysis Pro software. We added this statement to the Methods.
It is very important to note that because the authors did not sample the full repertoire of each bird, nor
quantified variation across different song bouts from the same bird over multiple sampling periods, they
are not comparing differences between individual birds, but rather between different recordings or
singing bouts (which happened to be given by different individual birds). Therefore, the level of
comparison made here is not between individual birds, but between individual recordings (or song
bouts). This needs to be clearly stated in the manuscript, and may call for some adjustment in the way
several statements are phrased (some e.g. Pg 16 Ln 22-23; Pg 18 Ln 20; Pg 19 Ln 2; Pg 19 ln 17).
Although the authors show that in general more complex song bouts have a greater temporal regularity,
given their limited dataset they cannot test or show this at an individual bird level. This in turn should
also put to rest any concerns regarding the lack of information on bird age and the differences in
recording duration.
>> We clarified this point in the Methods (song recordings), and revised the statements as suggested in
the results.
Specific comments:
Note: My comments use page numbers added by the submission process in the top right corner and the
larger line numbers which I think are from the original submitted document.
Background:
Add Latin name for the pied butcherbird.
>> done
Pg 13.
Ln 2-4: I would perhaps cite sources for the claims of their singing virtuosity. I would also perhaps
simplify this and clearly state what you mean exactly by “singing virtuosity”. Did you mean they have
long complex songs etc.?
>> We added reference as suggested. Singing virtuosity was meant to be a subjective statement.
Ln 8-9: “This tension between the appeal of regularity versus diversity…” -- To make it easier to
understand for a broader audience, I would perhaps rephrase this using discipline-specific language,
rather than poetically (e.g. The trade-off between regularity and diversity in birdsong…).
>> We changed the phrase as suggested.
Ln 10-12: It appears you have jumped from talking about birds to talking about humans (reflection of
our adaptive preference etc.) with no clear transition between the two different points. This makes this a
bit confusing to read as one doesn’t know whether you are talking about birds or humans.vI would start
a new paragraph at the end of Ln 8 and also change “music” to “human music”. Indeed, the next few
sentences appear to refer to human music and perception by humans.
>> We divided this section into two paragraphs
Pg 14.
Ln 13: “long epochs” – I would use a more appropriate noun here.
>> We replaced it with ‘large data sets’
Comma after (31, 32).
>> Done
Ln 15: Did you mean to say “balances repertoire complexity and regularity”?
>>Yes, thank you.
Discussion:
Pg 19.
Ln 17-18: I suggest repeating here your definition of “phrase” and “motif”.
>> Done.
Pg 20.
Ln 7: Increase.
>> Done.
Ln 13-14: Citations required here.
>> Done.
Ln 21-22: Add Latin names for Bengalese finches and canary.
>> Done
Methods:
Pg 23.
Ln 5: 0.5-3kHz -- seems like quite a narrow acoustic window. Do butcherbird songs not go above 3kHz?
Did you test whether this was an appropriate frequency range or is it just an assumption based on
observations? Please clarify.
>> Yes, this is the correct bandwidth.
“Goldwave noise reduction function to further reduce environmental background” – did this function
require any parameters or selection of noisy regions of the tracks? Please be more specific here.
>> No parameters, Goldwave use the background noise as a template. We now clarified it in the
Methods.
Ln 7: Did you use any specific Matlab Toolboxes? If so, please mention.
>> Done.
Pg 26:
Ln 6-7: Please provide more exact details about how these were shuffled. What was the procedure?
>> This was done by assigning each phrase with a pseudo-random number (using the Matlab Random
function) and then sorting phrases according to those random numbers.
Pg 27:
Ln 1-2: CVs values are between 0 and 1, for which linear statistically methods are usually not
appropriate. What is your justification for using linear methods such as paired t-tests here? Did you
check assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity?
>> Our CV* measures are mean values across element types, which should therefore distribute
normally. We further addressed this concern in our response to R2, and further showed that using non-
parametric bootstrap analysis as an alternative gives a similarly significant result.
Figures are a bit hard to read due to their small size. Hopefully the will be bigger in the final version.
>> Thank you for making this comment, we will make the figers larger.
Figure 4 & 5: It’s difficult to distinguish the pane labels (A, B, C etc.) from the figure labels (Type C
etc.).
>> fixed
The Tables and Supplementary figures lack captions and explanations of what they show. Also, there is
no explanation in the Methods for how the MANOVA tests (in one of the tables) were conducted.
