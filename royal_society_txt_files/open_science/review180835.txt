Review of Royal Society Open Science
This is an interesting manuscript that looked at the effects of marine protection in mesophotic
ecosystems in Cozumel. The topic is very important, as this ecosystem is vastly understudied. To
test the hypothesis that marine parks are effective in protected mesophotic ecosystems, the
authors conducted transects inside and outside a protected area.
In principle, the study is well designed and would be of great interest. However, the sample size
seems too small to draw any meaningful conclusions. The authors conducted only 4 transects per
habitat per site. While this might be enough to detect significant differences in coral cover, it
won’t be enough to detect differences in fish communities. And that’s (I think) precisely why they
saw no difference in fish communities inside and outside the protected area. Four transects per
site is simply not enough to detect a difference if there was one. Perhaps you could pool all of the
transect in two “sites”: protected and unprotected. Then maybe redo the analyses. If I am reading
the methods correctly, you would then have 20 transects in a protected site and 12 in an
unprotected one. The number is still low, but you might start seeing differences here.
Minor comments:
Line 1 of introduction: I am sure you mean >600 million people.
Study site: Are the protected areas actually protected? How well enforced is the marine park?
Methods: When were the surveys done? I mean, which days?
Discussion: Were the fishes that are shared between shallow and MCE equally abundant between
habitats?

Line 34 of abstract: What is the conclusive evidence that your results ‘therefore suggest that
MCEs may play a role in supporting fish populations’? Did you find fish reproduction sites down
there of commercially important fish species? Did you find high density of reproductive active
fish? Please, be more specific on this assertion.
Line 39 of abstract: ‘Our results suggest that MCEs should be incorporated into existing shallow-
reef focused Cozumel National Marine Park’ what is the conclusive evidence of such assertion in
terms of quantification of dispersion of organisms from MCEs to adjacent AMP? Please, be
specific on this assertion.
INTRODUCTION
I completely agree that MCEs play in important role as reservoir of genetic material that may
contribute to keep biodiversity of given areas. However, in terms of management MCEs
represent a high challenge to environmental authorities which still not have able to manage
shallow biodiversity reservoirs in coral reefs. Some example exist.
According to the objective, authors want to test whether MCEs -adjacent to a non-protected area-
by depth may retain more SIMILAR ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES to a protected area despite
shallow impact. This is not clear to me. By definition, the communities in MCEs would not be
similar to shallow water communities. I request authors to clarify specifically which communities
they refer to at this point (before reading Methods). I was expecting authors compared MCEs off
a non-protected area vs MCEs off a protected area, but it seem this is not the case
Otherwise, I suggest clarifying what authors refer to.
METHODS
Please, be clear about dates in which surveys were conducted. So, remove first sentence of
Methods and just describe the study area.
Ok, I found month and year in the line 135. You may here include a heading indicating Fieldwork
or move the heading Reef surveys to include the lines 135 to 140.
How many 30 m transects were conducted at each of the five sites? Please, begin establishing how
many replicates per site. I found at line 161 that were four transect, but include this number close
where you mention the transect. Also, later on indicate that same 4 transects for fish were also
surveyed for benthic communities. Specify that benthic communities included the following
categories: black coral, hard coral, calcareous macroalgae, fleshy….etc.
In the Data Analysis section, begin with fish for consistency with the transect description and the
go through benthic communities.
So, you worked out mean percentage cover of benthic communities in 4 transects in 5 sites.
Which of these five sites were located off a non-protected area and which were shallow reefs?
Regarding fish species, which fish species authors refer to? In text and in table 2 only Family level
was reported. How many species per family and which species were recorded? Clarify. Thus, in
line 199 and 200, authors say that Differences in species richness, biomass were identified using
ANOVA with depth and protection as factors, which species were those? How many species?
Which was the references that species were supposed to be commercial? Clarify.
The FishBase commercial based categorization may not apply for fish in Cozumel, Mexico. How
did you treat those species instead? There may be useful to include the National Fishery Chart
instead.
RESULTS
4
Authors say that fish species richness was greater on shallow reefs compared to that on MCEs,
but how many and which species were recorded? Authors say that 80 species were recorded in
the whole study, with 39 in shallow reefs and only seven species in MCEs, with 34 species in
common. My question is all those 80 species are of commercial importance in Cozumel? I think
that at least 20 would be. Now, I will prefer to include those species in IUCN red list category
instead.
In page 11, line 268, what do you mean with “weak effects of protection status”? Which is the
common fishery practice in that place (Cozumel)? Do fishermen use longlines? Are commercial
fish species being caught by longlines in deep areas? Please, provide information.
DISCUSSION
In page 12, line 317, you say “our results show that Cozumel MCEs benthic communities appear
similar between protected areas and shallow reef impacted areas” How do you may infer that
MCEs are serving as refuge for benthic species if there is not a clear relation of any kind of
displacement of species between locations?
Cozumel has a long history of black coral removal in very deep areas. How this was translated
into your results?
In page 14, lines 368, you mention that both shallow and MCEs reefs showed high biomass just
for commercially important fish species. Which species make the most in abundance regarding to
this assertion?
I strongly recommend shortening the Discussion and going to the main point to specifically
compare results between sites and with other MCEs in the Atlantic Ocean.
Characterization of MCEs is not around Cozumel but just for those at the western side of the
island. A comparison between both sides could it be very interesting.
The justification of including MCEs into the management must be approached based on the
importance of MCEs as essential habitat for a given group of commercially valuable species or
those species within the IUCN Red list category, or any particular spawning aggregation site for
some species, such as those for snappers (Lutjanidae) and groupers (Epinephelidae).

You have done an excellent revision of the paper. However, there are some minor edits I suggest
being incorporated to text:
In abstract, line 23, it is redundant to say Cozumel Island. Just mention Cozumel. In the Material
and methods explain it is an island. In line 24, need to insert the Mexican Caribbean instead just
Caribbean. In line 29, the term MPA (marine protected area) does not apply for Mexico since the
Cozumel protected area the paper refer to is a natural protected area according to environmental
law in Mexico. In line 41, the term Cozumel National Park no longer exists. It is a national park.
Move text included from line 86 to line 114 into Methods section since you are describing the
area. Please, do not use the term National Marine Park for that one in Cozumel, it is the National
Park Arrecifes Cozumel or in Spanish Parque Nacional Arrecifes de Cozumel.
Last paragraph of Introduction has to contain the objectives.
At the beginning of Results, remove the expression "After controlling for the effects of latitude".
This latter was a consideration that needed to be explained in the Methods section. So, begin the
Results section by "We identified differences in....."
9
In line 242, remove the word "Unsurprisingly"
In line 256, remove this "To further explore differences in benthic ecological communities
between sites within the MPA and those outside, we removed non-living benthic cover,
recalculated the percentage cover, and then conducted a redundancy analysis (RDA)" and insert
in the Methods section.
Same recommendation for the beginning of the Discussion section: Text from line 348 to 351 is a
consideration that has to be included in the Methods section.
In line 457 there is a problem with a quotation.
The conclusions have to be the responses to the objectives established.

Gress et al. Assessing the role of a Caribbean Marine Protected Area on Mesophotic Coral
Ecosystems
This manuscript addresses the potential for mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) to be buffered
from anthropogenic impacts that affect shallow water coral reefs by comparing fish and benthic
community composition between paired shallow and MCE reefs within and outside of marine
protected areas (MPAs) in Cozumel, Mexico. The author’s take advantage of the MPA design in
Cozumel to test the following hypotheses: 1) If MCEs are buffered from anthropogenic processes
associated with development (proximity to urban centers), then MCE community composition
should be similar regardless of protection and location. 2) Likewise, if shallow water coral
ecosystems are impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, then those outside of MPAs and in close
proximity to the urban center should show different community composition that those within
10
MPAs and far from urban centers. One of the strengths and unique aspects of this manuscript is
that it incorporates both benthic and fish community data to assess the differences among these
ecosystems. Many of the conclusions of the manuscript were broadly ecological rather than
directly addressed the author’s hypotheses, particularly because data were not available from
prior to MPA development or prior to urban development to compare the impacts of these
activities on coral reefs. Regardless of this limitation, the descriptive nature of the manuscript
makes a valid contribution of our understanding of MCE vs shallow water coral reefs and lends
some insight into the potential buffering capacity of MCEs. The author’s highlight that, while
coral community composition differs among MCE and shallow reefs, many fish species are
common. This result differs from recent studies (ex: Rocha et al. 2018, Science) that report
substantial differences between fish communities found in shallow and mesophotic coral
ecosystems, and highlights potential differences in regional (vs more global) patterns. I have
some concerns and comments (adding clarification may help) about the statistical analyses that
are outlined below.
Point by point comments
Line 19 “inclusion of all ecosystems” seems broad, particularly since this study isn’t addressing
ALL ecosystems that interact with coral reefs (ie open ocean pelagic, land-based/streams, etc)
Line 26 similar fish and benthic ecological communities
Line 27 recognized shallow reef impacts associated with development?
Line 28 MCE communities
Line 28 MCE communities are similar to each other?
Line 36 This doesn’t need to be added to the abstract but the statement begs the question: What
would be the size distribution of large body fish on a “healthy” reef.
Lines 39-42 Biodiversity wasn’t mentioned in the abstract. Is this a major finding of the study?
What about the conclusions associated with the benefits of preserving unique taxa and also
shared taxa (ie a finding from this study)?
Lines 44-45 Could rephrase to just say high biodiversity. “thousands” doesn’t have much context
Line 46-47 Are these goods and services a global estimate?
Lines 52-53 This would be a good point to bring up how deeper habitats might support resilience.
It’s in the next paragraph but I found myself looking for it here.
Line 68 to=as
Line 70-72 There is quite a lot of discussion of black corals and Oculina throughout the
manuscript. I think you need to state that these are non-photosynthetic corals (at least at Oculina
banks but I believe also the black corals). So the Deep Reef Refugia Hypothesis (DRRH) in
relation to connectivity and seeding shallow photosynthetic coral reefs isn’t relevant in this
context. The examples and case of black corals and protection is still relevant but only in the
context of preserving unique habitats and species and also that these habitats might be important
to fish. Line 72 particular needs this clarification and extra contexts because the black coral
examples are not particularly relevant/no direct examples of preserving refuges in the context of
the DRRH.
11
Line 80 typo, missing “it”
Line 83-84 Final sentence is a little awkward
Line 93-95 typo “renowned”. Same comment as above regarding non-photosynthetic corals and
the importance of these deeper water habitats vs the context of the DRRH. The context of lacking
ecological surveys also needs to be spelled out. Overexploitation is a call for more protection?
Additional studies? Potential vulnerabilities of MCEs without protection?
Line 100 it refers to the document/plan for the MPA?
Line 101 need to specify that the MPA plan designated zones.
Line 113 With unknown consequences to the MCEs?
Line 120 “remain ecologically similar” implies that this study will be measuring change.
Potentially change to “would/will be ecologically similar”
Line 122 This study does not address changes along depth gradients. It’s more of a factorial
design. Shallow protected vs shallow unprotected. MCE near protection vs MCE outside. Shallow
vs MCE inside and outside protection.
136-137 delete “full GPS location for sites are given in ESM 1” and just refer to ESM 1 in the
caption.
173-176 lowercase for categories?
Line 192 Bray-Curtis is typically used for counts of species. Percentages might be okay with this
metric, but please verify in a statistics textbook and potentially add a citation stating that this is
an appropriate dissimilarity index for percentages. The PRIMER manual and likely Legendre and
Legendre have detailed descriptions of these sorts of analyses as well as references for relevant
papers.
Lines195-199 RDA uses Euclidean distances by default (you can do a distance-based RDA with
Bray-Curtis) and not Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. If the same type of data is being used for both
analyses listed in this paragraph then it should be stated why the second analysis shifts to
Euclidean distance and the first uses Bray-Curtis.
Also with respect to these analyses: Are protection and depth included as factors in the RDA?
This could be clarified by including the RDA formula or stating in. Along those lines, Figure 3 a
and b implies that there were two RDA’s performed. One for shallow reefs and one for MCEs. I
assume these are biplots where protection is a discrete variable in each of these RDAs as an
independent variable (not pictured since these are biplots) and percent composition was the
response variable? The vectors are then showing the response variables and the colored shapes
are the stations/sites? Ultimately, please explain the methods in more detail and/or include the
formulas.
Line 203 add a comma after high
Line 256-258 Move to Methods
Lines 256-274 There is no data from before the MPA was created so this is not conclusive
evidence that these patterns are because of the MPA. Were the MPA plans originally designed
12
because of the ecological patterns (ie more coral at some sites so they put the MPA there?). This
can be incorporated into the discussion but I think there needs to be some additional context
about either the original MPA planning with respect to the ecological communities or so other
references from the region. Or, it that can’t be done, then simply stating that these are patterns
but not causation.
Lines 307-308 How many axes were in the NMDS analysis? Unlike PCA or other multivariate
analyses, the order of axes in NMDS is not associated with variance explained. Is there a third
axis that is not plotted or did the final result only have 2? This is important to state because axes
that aren’t plotted may show important patterns.
Line 311 correlated with PCOA axes?
Lines 330-333 Was body length compared among taxa that were common between the MPA and
non MPA sites? That would provide information size difference within taxa (potentially fishing
pressure or larger fish moving to protected areas). Comparing size among all taxa may just be a
result of differences in taxonomic composition (for example: more Pomacentridae (smaller
bodies) in one location and more Haemulidae (larger bodies).
Lines 339-341 More small fish in the MPA seems counter intuitive if it’s due to fishing. Potentially
could be associated with higher recruitment to “better” habitats? Potentially add to the
discussion.
Line 341 What is the cutoff for “large” fish?
Lines 349-351 These two considerations (particularly the second) highlight that Oculina/black
coral examples may not be the most appropriate (mentioned in comment above)
Line 351-352 …differences in MCE benthic communities..
Line 352 “relatively small” is a bit subjective
Line 353 not sure what you mean by “many MCE benthic groups appear similar regardless of
shallow reef state? Benthic communities in MCEs differed less than shallow benthic
communities? Needs to be rephrased a bit.
Lines 355-356 There is little results/discussion about particular species, so it would be better to
stick with the community context rather than species-specific. A shift in community with fewer
hard coral taxa?
Line 366 are they patch reefs? Consider replacing “so also” with therefore or “therefore also”.
Line 385 affecting benthic communities on MCEs as well as shallow reefs.
Line 416 is fitted -> was fit
Line 428-429 current strength and direction in associated with recruitment
Line 442 May need full species name here if the taxa were not already mentioned earlier in the
paper
Line 452 provided protection for some species/taxa but not all.
13
Line 465 typo: appear to be
Lines 466-468 Delete the final sentence. This isn’t supported by this study.
Line 471 comma after “recorded”
Line 481 delete “highly”. How does this scarcity compare to historic data? Are the low values a
result of fishing/mortality or were they always rare?
Lines 493-497 This thought process and link between the results of this study and the call for
protection needs to be expanded.
Lines 497-499 This paragraph needs a concluding sentence. For example, the planning may be
easier, and is there also a positive result?
Lines 500-508 These are new idea, results, and data within the context of this paper. It’s
interesting, but may not deserve an entire paragraph devoted to lionfish considering it wasn’t
discussed earlier.
Line 513 typo- “suggests that”
Lines 513-514 This conclusion seems overstated. Low commercial fish biomass may not be the
result of fishing or lack of protection. It may be the ecology of the fish. There is not historic data
presented at the reefs that would support this statement.
Lines 521-523 What part of this study supports the need to protect these deeper reefs and
harvesting regulations. I think it needs to be directly stated. As it is this seems like a bit of jump.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
You have done an excellent revision of the paper. However, there are some minor edits I suggest
being incorporated to text:
In abstract, line 23, it is redundant to say Cozumel Island. Just mention Cozumel. In the Material
and methods explain it is an island. In line 24, need to insert the Mexican Caribbean instead just
Caribbean. In line 29, the term MPA (marine protected area) does not apply for Mexico since the
Cozumel protected area the paper refer to is a natural protected area according to environmental
law in Mexico. In line 41, the term Cozumel National Park no longer exists. It is a national park.
Move text included from line 86 to line 114 into Methods section since you are describing the
area. Please, do not use the term National Marine Park for that one in Cozumel, it is the National
Park Arrecifes Cozumel or in Spanish Parque Nacional Arrecifes de Cozumel.
Last paragraph of Introduction has to contain the objectives.
At the beginning of Results, remove the expression "After controlling for the effects of latitude".
This latter was a consideration that needed to be explained in the Methods section. So, begin the
Results section by "We identified differences in....."
In line 242, remove the word "Unsurprisingly"
In line 256, remove this "To further explore differences in benthic ecological communities
between sites within the MPA and those outside, we removed non-living benthic cover,
recalculated the percentage cover, and then conducted a redundancy analysis (RDA)" and insert
in the Methods section.
Same recommendation for the beginning of the Discussion section: Text from line 348 to 351 is a
consideration that has to be included in the Methods section.
In line 457 there is a problem with a quotation.
The conclusions have to be the responses to the objectives established.

Gress et al. Assessing the role of a Caribbean Marine Protected Area on Mesophotic Coral
Ecosystems
This manuscript addresses the potential for mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) to be buffered
from anthropogenic impacts that affect shallow water coral reefs by comparing fish and benthic
community composition between paired shallow and MCE reefs within and outside of marine
protected areas (MPAs) in Cozumel, Mexico. The author’s take advantage of the MPA design in
Cozumel to test the following hypotheses: 1) If MCEs are buffered from anthropogenic processes
associated with development (proximity to urban centers), then MCE community composition
should be similar regardless of protection and location. 2) Likewise, if shallow water coral
ecosystems are impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, then those outside of MPAs and in close
proximity to the urban center should show different community composition that those within
MPAs and far from urban centers. One of the strengths and unique aspects of this manuscript is
that it incorporates both benthic and fish community data to assess the differences among these
ecosystems. Many of the conclusions of the manuscript were broadly ecological rather than
directly addressed the author’s hypotheses, particularly because data were not available from
prior to MPA development or prior to urban development to compare the impacts of these
activities on coral reefs. Regardless of this limitation, the descriptive nature of the manuscript
makes a valid contribution of our understanding of MCE vs shallow water coral reefs and lends
some insight into the potential buffering capacity of MCEs. The author’s highlight that, while
coral community composition differs among MCE and shallow reefs, many fish species are
common. This result differs from recent studies (ex: Rocha et al. 2018, Science) that report
substantial differences between fish communities found in shallow and mesophotic coral
ecosystems, and highlights potential differences in regional (vs more global) patterns. I have
some concerns and comments (adding clarification may help) about the statistical analyses that
are outlined below.
Point by point comments
Line 19 “inclusion of all ecosystems” seems broad, particularly since this study isn’t addressing
ALL ecosystems that interact with coral reefs (ie open ocean pelagic, land-based/streams, etc)
Line 26 similar fish and benthic ecological communities
Line 27 recognized shallow reef impacts associated with development?
Line 28 MCE communities
Line 28 MCE communities are similar to each other?
Line 36 This doesn’t need to be added to the abstract but the statement begs the question: What
would be the size distribution of large body fish on a “healthy” reef.
Lines 39-42 Biodiversity wasn’t mentioned in the abstract. Is this a major finding of the study?
What about the conclusions associated with the benefits of preserving unique taxa and also
shared taxa (ie a finding from this study)?
Lines 44-45 Could rephrase to just say high biodiversity. “thousands” doesn’t have much context
Line 46-47 Are these goods and services a global estimate?
Lines 52-53 This would be a good point to bring up how deeper habitats might support resilience.
It’s in the next paragraph but I found myself looking for it here.
Line 68 to=as
18
Line 70-72 There is quite a lot of discussion of black corals and Oculina throughout the
manuscript. I think you need to state that these are non-photosynthetic corals (at least at Oculina
banks but I believe also the black corals). So the Deep Reef Refugia Hypothesis (DRRH) in
relation to connectivity and seeding shallow photosynthetic coral reefs isn’t relevant in this
context. The examples and case of black corals and protection is still relevant but only in the
context of preserving unique habitats and species and also that these habitats might be important
to fish. Line 72 particular needs this clarification and extra contexts because the black coral
examples are not particularly relevant/no direct examples of preserving refuges in the context of
the DRRH.
Line 80 typo, missing “it”
Line 83-84 Final sentence is a little awkward
Line 93-95 typo “renowned”. Same comment as above regarding non-photosynthetic corals and
the importance of these deeper water habitats vs the context of the DRRH. The context of lacking
ecological surveys also needs to be spelled out. Overexploitation is a call for more protection?
Additional studies? Potential vulnerabilities of MCEs without protection?
Line 100 it refers to the document/plan for the MPA?
Line 101 need to specify that the MPA plan designated zones.
Line 113 With unknown consequences to the MCEs?
Line 120 “remain ecologically similar” implies that this study will be measuring change.
Potentially change to “would/will be ecologically similar”
Line 122 This study does not address changes along depth gradients. It’s more of a factorial
design. Shallow protected vs shallow unprotected. MCE near protection vs MCE outside. Shallow
vs MCE inside and outside protection.
136-137 delete “full GPS location for sites are given in ESM 1” and just refer to ESM 1 in the
caption.
173-176 lowercase for categories?
Line 192 Bray-Curtis is typically used for counts of species. Percentages might be okay with this
metric, but please verify in a statistics textbook and potentially add a citation stating that this is
an appropriate dissimilarity index for percentages. The PRIMER manual and likely Legendre and
Legendre have detailed descriptions of these sorts of analyses as well as references for relevant
papers.
Lines195-199 RDA uses Euclidean distances by default (you can do a distance-based RDA with
Bray-Curtis) and not Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. If the same type of data is being used for both
analyses listed in this paragraph then it should be stated why the second analysis shifts to
Euclidean distance and the first uses Bray-Curtis.
Also with respect to these analyses: Are protection and depth included as factors in the RDA?
This could be clarified by including the RDA formula or stating in. Along those lines, Figure 3 a
and b implies that there were two RDA’s performed. One for shallow reefs and one for MCEs. I
assume these are biplots where protection is a discrete variable in each of these RDAs as an
independent variable (not pictured since these are biplots) and percent composition was the
19
response variable? The vectors are then showing the response variables and the colored shapes
are the stations/sites? Ultimately, please explain the methods in more detail and/or include the
formulas.
Line 203 add a comma after high
Line 256-258 Move to Methods
Lines 256-274 There is no data from before the MPA was created so this is not conclusive
evidence that these patterns are because of the MPA. Were the MPA plans originally designed
because of the ecological patterns (ie more coral at some sites so they put the MPA there?). This
can be incorporated into the discussion but I think there needs to be some additional context
about either the original MPA planning with respect to the ecological communities or so other
references from the region. Or, it that can’t be done, then simply stating that these are patterns
but not causation.
Lines 307-308 How many axes were in the NMDS analysis? Unlike PCA or other multivariate
analyses, the order of axes in NMDS is not associated with variance explained. Is there a third
axis that is not plotted or did the final result only have 2? This is important to state because axes
that aren’t plotted may show important patterns.
Line 311 correlated with PCOA axes?
Lines 330-333 Was body length compared among taxa that were common between the MPA and
non MPA sites? That would provide information size difference within taxa (potentially fishing
pressure or larger fish moving to protected areas). Comparing size among all taxa may just be a
result of differences in taxonomic composition (for example: more Pomacentridae (smaller
bodies) in one location and more Haemulidae (larger bodies).
Lines 339-341 More small fish in the MPA seems counter intuitive if it’s due to fishing. Potentially
could be associated with higher recruitment to “better” habitats? Potentially add to the
discussion.
Line 341 What is the cutoff for “large” fish?
Lines 349-351 These two considerations (particularly the second) highlight that Oculina/black
coral examples may not be the most appropriate (mentioned in comment above)
Line 351-352 …differences in MCE benthic communities..
Line 352 “relatively small” is a bit subjective
Line 353 not sure what you mean by “many MCE benthic groups appear similar regardless of
shallow reef state? Benthic communities in MCEs differed less than shallow benthic
communities? Needs to be rephrased a bit.
Lines 355-356 There is little results/discussion about particular species, so it would be better to
stick with the community context rather than species-specific. A shift in community with fewer
hard coral taxa?
Line 366 are they patch reefs? Consider replacing “so also” with therefore or “therefore also”.
Line 385 affecting benthic communities on MCEs as well as shallow reefs.

Line 416 is fitted -> was fit
Line 428-429 current strength and direction in associated with recruitment
Line 442 May need full species name here if the taxa were not already mentioned earlier in the
paper
Line 452 provided protection for some species/taxa but not all.
Line 465 typo: appear to be
Lines 466-468 Delete the final sentence. This isn’t supported by this study.
Line 471 comma after “recorded”
Line 481 delete “highly”. How does this scarcity compare to historic data? Are the low values a
result of fishing/mortality or were they always rare?
Lines 493-497 This thought process and link between the results of this study and the call for
protection needs to be expanded.
Lines 497-499 This paragraph needs a concluding sentence. For example, the planning may be
easier, and is there also a positive result?
Lines 500-508 These are new idea, results, and data within the context of this paper. It’s
interesting, but may not deserve an entire paragraph devoted to lionfish considering it wasn’t
discussed earlier.
Line 513 typo- “suggests that”
Lines 513-514 This conclusion seems overstated. Low commercial fish biomass may not be the
result of fishing or lack of protection. It may be the ecology of the fish. There is not historic data
presented at the reefs that would support this statement.
Lines 521-523 What part of this study supports the need to protect these deeper reefs and
harvesting regulations. I think it needs to be directly stated. As it is this seems like a bit of jump.

Appendix A
Assessing the role of a Caribbean Marine Protected Area on Mesophotic Coral
Ecosystems
Gress et al. compared benthic communities and fish biomass and community
composition among shallow water coral reefs and mesophotic coral
ecosystems in protected and unprotected regions in a Mesoamerican coral
reef ecosystem. This study assesses the role of deeper reefs environments as
refuges for shallow water coral reefs by 1) comparing and contrasting
taxonomic composition among these habitats, and 2) by assessing if
taxonomic composition differs in association with levels of protection.
While the information in the present manuscript does enhance the scientific
knowledge and understanding of coral reef ecosystems across depths, there
are several key points that need to be addressed.
This manuscript primarily focuses on local development and disturbances.
The deep reef refugia hypothesis encompasses many types of disturbances
such as temperature fluctuations, fishing, disturbances such as storms, and
local development. It would be worth mentioning the type of disturbance
that is being addressed early on in the manuscript (in the Introduction) and
to state that this study does not apply to potentially global stressors such as
temperature.
It is difficult to determine the locations of mesophotic and shallow reefs in
Figure 1 (ie the map or map legend should be modified); however, many of
the patterns observed in the manuscript may be associated with site
locations and local environments such as oceanography that influence
benthic taxonomic composition. This possibility needs to be discussed and
addressed more thoroughly in the Discussion as a major limitation of the
study.
One major concern is that many of the statistical analyses do not seem
appropriate for the type of data collected. The authors should carefully
review their data analysis choices and include citations and rationale for
these choices. Additionally, some of the results and conclusions based on
these analyses are overstated or unsupported. (see specific comments
below)
There are also several sentences that require revision and grammatical
correction. Some, are listed in the line-by-line comments.
Studies that address the ecology of reefs across depths are necessary and
informative. This study also has the added component of not only looking at
the potential natural refuge function of mesophotic reefs, but also assessing
whether they are buffered from local disturbances.
I hope that these comments are helpful for the authors.
Line 19 fails to acknowledge is strong wording. Possibly “overlooks” or “do
not incorporate”?
Line 19 …many shallow water reef species can also…
Line 23 consider replacing “main” with “major”. Also state what sort of
development.
Construction?
Line 27 …adjacent to heavily impacted shallow reefs,…
Line 38 It is unclear from the abstract why these MCEs should be in
management plans.
Because of fish community similarities? Or because corals are
present? Both?
Line 47 …many recent conservation efforts have focused..
Line 55 could survive in MCEs
Line 58 I’m not sure that is a “However” statement.
Line 64 “recolonize shallow reefs…” –this statement needs a citation. There
are several
biophysical modeling or genetics studies that can support this claim.
Line 70 This paragraph needs a conclusion sentence to tie together these
citations. It’s unclear
what the main point is.
Lines 71-73 Confusing grammar
Line 73 Only one example is mentioned in this paragraph, but the sentence
states that there
are additional examples. Please add citations and examples.
Lines 88-91 and throughout the manuscript. The inverted sentence structure
is difficult to
follow.
Line 94 delete “a” before heavily
Line 95 Again, what is the main development?
Lines 95-98 Please revise these sentences to clarify the major goal of the
study. The sentence
structure and grammar and obscuring the point of the study.
Line 98 These data will help to serve as a baseline for future studies and also
provide insight in
the the role of these deep reefs as refuges?
Lines 106-107 …There are extensive fringing coral reef ecosytems off the
west coast of Cozumel
that are well recognized for their biological and socioeconomic
importance.... Inverted
sentence structure and sentences can be combined for brevity.
Lines 108-113 This should be in the Introduction.
Lines 113-134 Some of this can also be moved to the Introduction. The
description of the study
sites can stay in the Methods, but the history of Cozumel reefs would
be better suited for the Introduction.
Line 150 delete “100% cotton”
Line 149 Add a citation regarding the efficacy of GoPros for this work.
Particularly for measure
fish size since they have a fisheye lens.
Line 152 Four 30 m transects is quite limited. Were these transects all at the
same time of year
and lunar phase? The number of small fish can be substantially
impacted by settlement of new recruits and juveniles and could
influence the results.
Line 188 I’m not sure that Euclidean distance is an appropriate measure for
percent cover since
it’s not a continuous number. Please provide a citation that states
that this is acceptable or consider a more appropriate analysis.
Line 193 Again, the data analysis choices seem to be unsupported. Here, the
analysis is using
Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, which is typically used for abundance or
density data with some low numbers and zeros. This distance metric
may not be appropriate for percentages. Please provide a citation
stating that Bray-Curtis is appropriate for these data, or consider
another analysis. Alternatively, calculate your benthic composition as
a density along each transect to obtain continuous numbers that may
be more appropriate for these metrics. It’s unclear why the choice
would be made to use Euclidean distance in the first analysis (above)
and Bray-Curtis in the second. Please provide citations and support
for these choices and rationale, or modify the analyses.
Line 195 modify package citation (vegan package; R version…)
Line 196 How was it standardized? Centered and scaled?
Line 198 Commercially valuable for fishing? Aquariums?
Line 200 ANOVA assumes that data are continuous, normal distributions,
homogeneity of
variance. It seems unlikely that species richness (ie counts at each
site) meets these assumptions. Was biomass simply the estimate of
body weight for each fish and were biomass values for ANOVAs
simply grouping these estimated weights among all species regardless
of community composition at each site?
Line 210 No need to state the function used. Instead tell the reader what the
function does.
Line 220 delete “crucially” and revise to clarify..”the significant interaction
between depth and
protection indicates that…”?
Line 222 For a point in the Discussion…it seems that gorgonian cover may
have a lot to do with
wave exposure or other environmental variability between sites.
Line 230 The differences between deep and shallow were statistically
compared?
Line 231 This suggests a difference in reef type. This could be talked about in
the Discussion or
the analysis could use a stratified design to make habitats more
comparable.
Line 236 Standardized by just removing non living substrate and recalculating
percent
composition without it?
Line 243-244 this result would be easier to see if the figure was color coded
to show levels of
protection and not site.
Lines 247-249 move to the Discussion
Line 264-266 There is very little discussion regarding differences in
community composition
among depths. Considering doing an NMDS analysis to summarize
and visualize the differences.
Line 268-271 Following the thought process above, comparing biomass of all
fish species
does not seem very informative if community composition is different
(ie maybe the community is dominated by smaller bodied fish). I’m
not sure if the point of the biomass analyses are to provide
information about some sort of biological carrying capacity, but other
than that rationale I don’t think it’s appropriate to compare by
combining all species when we know that taxonomic composition
differs. One option that the authors can try may be to revise biomass
analyses by standardizing for each species – possibly calculate the
deviation in biomass for each species from the mean for that species
and then scale those values to basically obtain z scores that are
comparable among all species. This would then tell you if among all
species, the biomass tends to be higher or lower than expected given
the taxonomic composition.
Lines 274-280 Unnecessary
Line 285-286 Unclear sentence
Line 290-291 This is the first mention in the text of these commercially
valuable species. They
seem to be valuable for aquariums? Or are there local artisanal
fisheries? Please state this in the Methods.
Line 295 Again, species composition is different. I’m not sure how
informative this analysis is.
Line 319 This is an overstatement of the findings. MCEs may be capable of
serving as refuges
because they share some taxa. But there is not evidence here to
suggest that they ARE serving as refuges.
Line 321-322 It’s worth mentioning that corals are one of the most
threatened groups in
shallow reefs.
Line 325 Why is >500 mm the cutoff for large body fishes? There needs to be
some rationale for
why this is considered large for the area. Also, it seems that many
large body fish would be quite mobile. They would be able to swim
away from the cameras, and possibly move between shallow and
deeper habitats.
Line 333-334 This study has no evidence that hard corals are the main
structural habitat.
Sponges appear to be more abundant.
Line 342 Inverted grammar
Line 349 But the habitats are patch reefs. An entirely different reef structure
and the design
was not stratified.
Lines 350-353 Consider rephrasing. These sentences suggest that the findings
of this paper are
not robust.
Line 356-357 Were the coral species different on shallow reefs and MCEs?
This is the case in
some Caribbean reefs and an important point of discussion.
Line 360-362 Also differences between sites. Exposure, light, flow regime?
Line 363 There is no evidence in this paper that gorgonians are a better
indicator. Please resive
the sentence...high densities of gorgonians support previous studies
suggesting that gorgonians are a better indicator of MCEs…
Line 372-374 Again, I think it’s important to compare fish community
composition among
depths before directly drawing conclusions based on biomass.
Lines 379-382 Unclear. Please clarify. Also, do not refer to figures in the
Discussion.
Line 382-383 The final sentence isn’t necessary.
Line 385 What kind of fish (should be in results) and again, why is 500 mm
the cutoff? Please
provide a citation.
Line 396 This paragraph needs a concluding sentence to remind the reader
what the results of
this study show us.
Line 407 This may not be possible given the number of sites, but can these
analyses be framed
in a regression framework to mitigate the issues this grouping among
sites based on depth and protection even though the environment
may differ among sites? Possibly based on distance from disturbance?
Line 411-412 Delete the sentence: ”However the greatest….flow is
restricted”. This is not
relevant to this study since it’s not in a lagoon.
Line 414-415 Please describe how and why this current gradient is a primary
driver of declines i
n the north. The flow is south to north? Shouldn’t the location of the
protected area
then seed the degraded and impacted reefs in the north with larvae?
This seems like an beneficial design.
Line 416 the final sentence is unnecessary.
Line 430 change “is not” to “are not”
Line 432 Have not changed since what time period? State the time frame for
the reader.
Line 436 Structural habitat was not measured in this study (ie rugosity or
some other metric
was not measured), so this sentence seems unsupported by the
study.
Line 444-447 seems to negate and diminish the results of the study. Consider
doing a power
analysis if this is a concern.
Line 450 Why would diver avoidance be worse on deeper reefs?
Line 452-453 temper the wording here. Possibly less likely to drive the
differences, but I’m not
sure it’s unlikely
Line 454-454 delete the final sentence
Line 463 typo
Line 474 consider expanding this. What upstream locations?
Line 479-480 Awkward sentence structure. Also, it is unclear what is meant
by “established”
benthic community.
Line 481 Specify that these are local disturbances and remind the reader
what results support
this.
Line 486-487 Consider revising. This statement seems very simplistic
considering the

RE: Manuscript reference: RSOS-170521
Dear Prof Padian,
Please find attached a revised version of our manuscript, titled “Assessing
the role of a Caribbean Marine Protected Area on Mesophotic Coral
Ecosystems” which we would like to be considered for publication in Royal
Society Open Science.
The comments of the three reviewers were highly insightful and enabled us
to greatly improve the quality of our manuscript. Attached with the
manuscript, please find attached our point-by-point responses to each of the
concerns raised by the reviewers, along with references to the changes in the
manuscript.
The most significant changes include: Following the suggestion by reviewer 3,
we have now reanalysed our fish community data, including a new figure
(Figure 5) and table (Table 3). This allows species level patterns in fish
communities to be observed. We have also revised our statistics for Figure 2,
and now present results using non-parametric methods. In addition, we have
made numerous smaller edits to the paper following suggestions from the
reviewers. All co-authors have read and agreed to the manuscript.
We hope that the revisions in the manuscript and our accompanying
responses will be sufficient to make our manuscript suitable for publication
in Royal Society Open Science. We shall look forward to hearing from you at
your earliest convenience.
Yours sincerely,
Erika Gress

Response to Reviewer Comments
Reviewer: 1
1.1 This is an interesting manuscript that looked at the effects of marine protection
in mesophotic ecosystems in Cozumel. The topic is very important, as this
ecosystem is vastly understudied. To test the hypothesis that marine parks are
effective in protected mesophotic ecosystems, the authors conducted transects
inside and outside a protected area.
Thank you.
1.2 In principle, the study is well designed and would be of great interest. However,
the sample size seems too small to draw any meaningful conclusions. The authors
conducted only 4 transects per habitat per site. While this might be enough to
detect significant differences in coral cover, it won’t be enough to detect differences
in fish communities. And that’s (I think) precisely why they saw no difference in fish
communities inside and outside the protected area. Four transects per site is simply
not enough to detect a difference if there was one. Perhaps you could pool all of the
transect in two “sites”: protected and unprotected. Then maybe redo the analyses.
If I am reading the methods correctly, you would then have 20 transects in a
protected site and 12 in an unprotected one. The number is still low, but you might
start seeing differences here.
We conducted surveys at eight sites, five sites within the Cozumel protected area,
and three sites outside the protected area. At each site we surveyed both the
shallow reef (15 m) and MCEs (55 m), completing four transects at each depth,
giving a total of eight transects per site. Therefore, we have 64 transects in total in
this study. We disagree with your suggestion of pooling all the transects into two
groups (protected vs unprotected). As we conducted four transects per depth at each
site, transects that were conducted at the same site are more likely to be similar to
each other than other transects conducted at different sites despite being at the
same depth and protection zone. In our analysis we have controlled for this spatial
replication by either: (i) fitting site as a factor in the models, or (ii) taking the mean
of the four transects from a specific depth at a site and used this value in the
analysis. Pooling all transects at the same depth for both protection zones would
mean ignoring that our transects are nested within sites and so analyzing each
individual transect as an independent replicate. This would be statistically invalid
given our survey design.
While we agree that additional transects would be useful, the challenges of high
time and costs of surveying MCEs at 55 m limited us from doing additional transects.
Many other studies have used similar numbers of transects (or even fewer/smaller
areas) and have analyzed data using similar statistical approaches as we have, and
still have detected significant patterns in the fish community/biomass (e.g. Brokovich
et al. 2008; Brokovich et al. 2010; Garcia-Sais et al. 2010; Bejarano et al. 2014;
Andradi-Brown et al. 2016; Pinheiro et al. 2016). Therefore, while acknowledging
that additional transects would be beneficial, we still believe that our approach is a
robust design to detect changes in fish communities/biomass.

detected changes in fish communities:

1.3 Line 1 of introduction: I am sure you mean >600 million people.
We have double checked this number, and 6 million is correct. Although we have just
written ‘millions of people’ since the source estimated this number a few years ago.
1.4 Study site: Are the protected areas actually protected? How well enforced is the
marine park?
We could argue from personal experience and personal comments that regulations
in the National Marine Park are not been entirely enforced/implemented. However,
there is no ‘published’ evidence to support our opinion/observations. It is also not
our intention to assess implementation of the Cozumel MPA regulations. We have
clarified in the manuscript that we are only assessing differences of benthic and fish
communities between the MPA and non-MPA sites.
1.5 Methods: When were the surveys done? I mean, which days?
Now added the exact dates of the survey to the manuscript.
1.6 Discussion: Were the fishes that are shared between shallow and MCE equally
abundant between habitats?
Table 3 has now been added to the manuscript which presents the biomass for fish
species correlating with the PCOA axis. This now shows that for many of these
species, while they are shared between depths, there are differences in biomass. We
have also updated the discussion to give consideration to the differences in biomass
between species at the different depths. We have not gone further into this, as we
do not wish to present full species level data for all 80 recorded species.
Reviewer 2
2.1 Line 34 of abstract: What is the conclusive evidence that your results ‘therefore
suggest that MCEs may play a role in supporting fish populations’? Did you find fish
reproduction sites down there of commercially important fish species? Did you find
high density of reproductive active fish? Please, be more specific on this assertion.
We found a high degree of overlap between shallow water and MCE fish species
(42.5 %), including commercially valuable species (39.6 %). We have now added
these numbers into the abstract.
2.2 Line 39 of abstract: ‘Our results suggest that MCEs should be incorporated into
existing shallow-reef focused Cozumel National Marine Park’ what is the conclusive
evidence of such assertion in terms of quantification of dispersion of organisms
from MCEs to adjacent AMP? Please, be specific on this assertion.
We have clarified this sentence in the abstract. While we acknowledge that we do
not have ‘quantification of dispersion of organisms from MCEs to adjacent AMP’, we
disagree that this is required to recommend management plans consider MCEs. Five
of the MCE sites we surveyed are already within the boundaries of the Cozumel
National Park, yet the management plan for this park does not acknowledge their
existence. We believe that MCEs inherent biodiversity, the combination of diverse
species assemblages, including the presence of commercially important fisheries
species, and that they are already within the boundaries of the National Park are
ample justification to recommend their consideration in the National Marine Park
management plan.
2.3 I completely agree that MCEs play in important role as reservoir of genetic
material that may contribute to keep biodiversity of given areas. However, in terms
of management MCEs represent a high challenge to environmental authorities
which still not have able to manage shallow biodiversity reservoirs in coral reefs.
Some example exist.
Thank you. We have expanded the section in the introduction that discuses some
examples of MCE management.
2.4 According to the objective, authors want to test whether MCEs -adjacent to a
non-protected area- by depth may retain more SIMILAR ECOLOGICAL
COMMUNITIES to a protected area despite shallow impact. This is not clear to me.
By definition, the communities in MCEs would not be similar to shallow water
communities. I request authors to clarify specifically which communities they refer
to at this point (before reading Methods). I was expecting authors compared MCEs
off a non-protected area vs MCEs off a protected area, but it seems this is not the
case. Otherwise, I suggest clarifying what authors refer to.
The Cozumel National Marine Park includes both shallow reefs and MCEs; although
MCEs are ‘included’ only because the management plan delimits the area to 100 m
isobath. Therefore, we are assessing differences between the MCEs within the MPA
and the MCEs outside. If MCEs are naturally a depth refuge, we would expect these
communities remain similar, despite the disturbance causing large differences in
shallow reef condition. We framed this hypothesis in two ways. If MCEs act as a
refuge habitat from the local disturbance affecting shallows we would expect to see:
(i) Ecological community differences between shallow reefs inside the MPA
and the ones outside larger than the differences between the MCEs
adjacent to the MPA shallow reefs compared to MCEs adjacent to the
non-MPA shallow reefs.
(ii) The shift in ecological communities across the depth gradient between a
shallow disturbed reef and an adjacent MCE (naturally protected by
depth) is likely to be different to the community shift observed across
the depth gradient from a MPA shallow reef and the adjacent MCE also
inside the MPA (both by MPA and naturally by depth). i.e. we should
detect protection:depth interactions in our analysis.
We test these hypothesis, although we are cautious in our interpretation, as we
cannot clearly disaggregate the effects of MPA and disturbance from north-south
geographical patterns along the Cozumel coast.
2.5 Please, be clear about dates in which surveys were conducted. So, remove first
sentence of Methods and just describe the study area. Ok, I found month and year
in the line 135. You may here include a heading indicating Fieldwork or move the
heading Reef surveys to include the lines 135 to 140.
We have now added exact dates, and restructured the background information on
Cozumel to the introduction. This makes the details of the field surveys clearer and in
one place.
2.6 How many 30 m transects were conducted at each of the five sites? Please,
begin establishing how many replicates per site. I found at line 161 that were four
transect, but include this number close where you mention the transect. Also, later
on indicate that same 4 transects for fish were also surveyed for benthic
communities.
We have now moved this earlier in the methods section, so it is clear when we first
discuss the survey methods how many transects were done. We have also stated in
this first paragraph that the same transects were used for both benthic and fish
surveys.
2.7 Specify that benthic communities included the following categories: black coral,
hard coral, calcareous macroalgae, fleshy….etc.
We do this already, and have now shifted the benthic analysis section to the top of
the video/image analysis.
2.8 In the Data Analysis section, begin with fish for consistency with the transect
description and the go through benthic communities.
We have reversed this now, as throughout the rest of the manuscript we start with
benthic first, and so have adjusted the methods section to start with benthic.
2.9 So, you worked out mean percentage cover of benthic communities in 4
transects in 5 sites. Which of these five sites were located off a non-protected area
and which were shallow reefs?
All eight sites we surveyed had transects conducted on both shallow reefs and MCEs.
We have clarified this in the methods.
2.10 Regarding fish species, which fish species authors refer to? In text and in table
2 only Family level was reported. How many species per family and which species
were recorded? Clarify.
ESM9 contains the full species list of the 80 fish species we recorded, and whether
they were present on shallow reefs and MCEs. The original Table 2 referred to here
by the reviewer has now been removed from the manuscript. We have replaced this
with a new table, Table 3, which contains species level data for 18 species that
correlated with the first two axis of the PCOA, suggesting they were responsible for
driving patterns in the fish community analysis.
2.11 Thus, in line 199 and 200, authors say that Differences in species richness,
biomass were identified using ANOVA with depth and protection as factors, which
species were those? How many species?
We have clarified the text that here we are referring to all fish species and total fish
biomass. We have also moved the definition of commercially valuable fish species to
the sentence after, so as to avoid any confusion/implication that we are talking
about commercially valuable fish species richness in this sentence.
2.12 Which was the references that species were supposed to be commercial?
Clarify.
Fishbase has a price categorization index, this ranks each fish species based on
commercial value for across a wide-range of fisheries, broadly classifying fish on a
scale from ‘Low’ economic value through to ‘Very High’.
2.13 The FishBase commercial based categorization may not apply for fish in
Cozumel, Mexico. How did you treat those species instead? There may be useful to
include the National Fishery Chart instead.
Thank you for this suggestion, we carefully reviewed the 2012 edition (most recent)
of the Mexican National Fishery Chart (Carta Nacional Pesquera). We considered
using this, however, not all species on the Mexican National Fisheries Chart have
high commercial value for fisheries in Cozumel. Just as one example amongst many:
Canthigaster rostrata, the sharp-nose puffer is listed, this is a small bodied very
common species in the Caribbean that is poisonous (so cannot be eaten) and is rarely
in the aquarium trade. We are not sure how the species were chosen for inclusion in
the Mexican National Fisheries Chat, but feel that the Fishbase price categorization
index is a more reliable listing of commercial value, as it is based on a synthesis of
fish that are actively sold.
2.14 Authors say that fish species richness was greater on shallow reefs compared
to that on MCEs, but how many and which species were recorded? Authors say that
80 species were recorded in the whole study, with 39 in shallow reefs and only
seven species in MCEs, with 34 species in common. My question is all those 80
species are of commercial importance in Cozumel? I think that at least 20 would be.
Now, I will prefer to include those species in IUCN red list category instead.
We have now stated in the results the number of fish that are commercially
important at each depth. We have also added into our species list (ESM 9) an
additional column indicating the fish included which were considered commercially
valuable based on Fishbase.
2.15 In page 11, line 268, what do you mean with “weak effects of protection
status”?
We were referring to detecting a statistically significant result, but with a p value of
0.04, suggesting that the significance of this was not strong. We have removed this
‘weak effects’ from the text to avoid any confusion that we were implying the effect
size for protection was small.
2.16 Which is the common fishery practice in that place (Cozumel)? Do fishermen
use longlines? Are commercial fish species being caught by longlines in deep areas?
Please, provide information.
The National Marine Park is zoned, and different regulations including different
fishing practices are allowed on specific zones. We have added in the manuscript
that some fisheries, such as hook and line are allowed in non-intensive use zones.
Unfortunately no data exist on the frequency/location of areas where illegal fisheries
occur.
2.17 In page 12, line 317, you say “our results show that Cozumel MCEs benthic
communities appear similar between protected areas and shallow reef impacted
areas” How do you may infer that MCEs are serving as refuge for benthic species if
there is not a clear relation of any kind of displacement of species between
locations?
We have modified the text to make this clearer. The main point we are making is
that MCEs are protected naturally by virtue of their depth. Therefore despite big
shallow reef impacts adjacent to Cozumel town that has caused major impacts on
the reefs, the MCE benthic community adjacent to Cozumel town still appears similar
to that within the protected area.
2.18 Cozumel has a long history of black coral removal in very deep areas. How this
was translated into your results?
In this study, black coral cover was higher inside the MPA, however overall black
coral cover was low. We have also included the reference of a study that specifically
assess black coral population density changes in the area (Gress and Andradi-Brown
2017).
2.19 In page 14, lines 368, you mention that both shallow and MCEs reefs showed
high biomass just for commercially important fish species. Which species make the
most in abundance regarding to this assertion?
Table 3 now presents the species level results that correlate with the PCOA axis,
suggesting they are driving the patterns.
2.20 I strongly recommend shortening the Discussion and going to the main point to
specifically compare results between sites and with other MCEs in the Atlantic
Ocean.
Characterization of MCEs is not around Cozumel but just for those at the western
side of the island. A comparison between both sides could it be very interesting.
We have slightly reduced the length of the discussion focus on Cozumel, and
expanded the discussion section comparing our results with elsewhere in the western
Atlantic. We have specified that is only of the west side of the island. Indeed, the
comparison between both sides would be very interesting, but is beyond the scope of
this manuscript.
2.21 The justification of including MCEs into the management must be approached
based on the importance of MCEs as essential habitat for a given group of
commercially valuable species or those species within the IUCN Red list category, or
any particular spawning aggregation site for some species, such as those for
snappers (Lutjanidae) and groupers (Epinephelidae).
Thank you, we have made some minor edits to the discussion on the presence of
commercially valuable fish species on the MCEs. ESM9 contains the full list of
commercially valuable species recorded on MCEs within the Cozumel National
Marine Park. These MCEs are already included in the park boundaries, we are just
arguing that they should be considered within the park management plan. We show
highly diverse communities on MCEs, and the presence of a suite of commercially
valuable species. We also believe that MCEs should be considered in the
management plan because of their inherent biodiversity and identified threats
though.
Reviewer 3
3.1 Gress et al. compared benthic communities and fish biomass and community
composition among shallow water coral reefs and mesophotic coral ecosystems in
protected and unprotected regions in a Mesoamerican coral reef ecosystem. This
study assesses the role of deeper reefs environments as refuges for shallow water
coral reefs by 1) comparing and contrasting taxonomic composition among these
habitats, and 2) by assessing if taxonomic composition differs in association with
levels of protection. While the information in the present manuscript does enhance
the scientific knowledge and understanding of coral reef ecosystems across depths,
there are several key points that need to be addressed. This manuscript primarily
focuses on local development and disturbances. The deep reef refugia hypothesis
encompasses many types of disturbances such as temperature fluctuations, fishing,
disturbances such as storms, and local development. It would be worth mentioning
the type of disturbance that is being addressed early on in the manuscript (in the
Introduction) and to state that this study does not apply to potentially global
stressors such as temperature.
Thank you. We have now added a sentence stating: ‘We specifically test if MCEs, by
virtue of their depth, naturally provide protection from coastal anthropogenic
disturbance’ and so clearly indicate that we are not addressing global stressors such
as temperature.
3.2 It is difficult to determine the locations of mesophotic and shallow reefs in
Figure 1 (ie the map or map legend should be modified); however, many of the
patterns observed in the manuscript may be associated with site locations and local
environments such as oceanography that influence benthic taxonomic composition.
This possibility needs to be discussed and addressed more thoroughly in the
Discussion as a major limitation of the study.
All sites identified in Figure 1 were surveyed for both shallow reefs and MCEs. We
have clarified this in the main text and in the legend for Figure 1. We have now
added latitude as a variable into our models to account for any natural variation
that occurs along the Cozumel coastline. We have expanded the paragraph in the
discussion section that considers the limitation of the distribution of sites, with the
unprotected area to the north of the protected area.
3.3 One major concern is that many of the statistical analyses do not seem
appropriate for the type of data collected. The authors should carefully review their
data analysis choices and include citations and rationale for these choices.
We have carefully reviewed the statistical analyses used. We have responded to your
specific concerns below in your later comments.
3.4 Additionally, some of the results and conclusions based on these analyses are
overstated or unsupported. (see specific comments below)
We have carefully reviewed our results and conclusions, and following your
suggestions we have added additional new analysis to the manuscript (e.g. Figure 5
and Table 3). We have responded to these specific concerns below in your later
comments.
3.5 There are also several sentences that require revision and grammatical
correction. Some, are listed in the line-by-line comments.
We have checked the manuscript for grammar.
3.6 Studies that address the ecology of reefs across depths are necessary and
informative. This study also has the added component of not only looking at the
potential natural refuge function of mesophotic reefs, but also assessing whether
they are buffered from local disturbances. I hope that these comments are helpful
for the authors.
Thank you, we found your comments very valuable for improving this manuscript.

3.29 Line 152 Four 30 m transects is quite limited. Were these transects all at the
same time of year and lunar phase? The number of small fish can be substantially
impacted by settlement of new recruits and juveniles and could influence the
results.
All transects were done within a two week period during daylight hours. Stereo-video
systems DOVs are unable to accurately assess very young recruits, so any effects
from settlement of small (<2 cm) fishes are likely to have negligible effect on our
results.
3.30 Line 188 I’m not sure that Euclidean distance is an appropriate measure for
percent cover since it’s not a continuous number. Please provide a citation that
states that this is acceptable or consider a more appropriate analysis.
Thank you for this, we have considered this carefully. We have simplified this
analysis to use a non-parametric method, the Mann-Whitney U test. This does not
alter the significance/lack of significance in any of our results or therefore affect the
interpretation of the data.
3.31 Line 193 Again, the data analysis choices seem to be unsupported. Here, the
analysis is using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, which is typically used for abundance or
density data with some low numbers and zeros. This distance metric may not be
appropriate for percentages. Please provide a citation stating that Bray-Curtis is
appropriate for these data, or consider another analysis. Alternatively, calculate
your benthic composition as a density along each transect to obtain continuous
numbers that may be more appropriate for these metrics.
Bray-Curtis dissimilarities are appropriate for percentage cover. While often used for
abundance or density data, part of the Bray-Curtis calculation is turning the values
into proportions regardless, and is acceptable to use for percentages. Anderson et al.
(2008) on p32 of the PERMANOVA statistical manual demonstrates in example how
it is appropriate to use Bray-Curtis dissimilarities on benthic percentage cover data.
-Anderson, M. J., Gorley, R. N., & Clarke, K. R. (2008). PERMANOVA+ for PRIMER:

-Jari Oksanen, author of the vegan package in R, has also written about this here
(https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-ecology/2014-May/004506.html).
We have added a citation to our methods section to Anderson et al. (2008) to
support the use of Bray-Curtis on percentage cover data.
3.32 It’s unclear why the choice would be made to use Euclidean distance in the first
analysis (above) and Bray-Curtis in the second. Please provide citations and support
for these choices and rationale, or modify the analyses.
The first analysis was a univariate analysis, i.e. we did not have multivariate data as
were doing comparisons between sites with different protection status for a single
benthic cover category. Hence, we labelled it as permutational-ANOVA. Euclidean
distances are appropriate for univariate analyses such as this (Anderson et al. 2008).
The second analysis is using the whole benthic community dataset, therefore is a
multivariate dataset, so Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were used followed by
Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA).
Following Reviewer 3’s comments in 3.30 we have now removed this initial
permutational-ANOVA, and now use a Mann-Whitney U test. The permutational-
ANOVA remains for the species level fish biomass analysis, and the PERMANOVA
remains for the multivariate analysis.
3.33 Line 195 modify package citation (vegan package; R version…)
We are not sure what the reviewer wants altered here. The citation refers to vegan,
and later at the end of the methods we have a citation stating exactly the version of
R used and where all the raw data is.
3.34 Line 196 How was it standardized? Centered and scaled?
We have removed reference to standardization, as we did not mean we had
centered and scaled the data. We have clarified that we removed the non-living
substrate and then recalculated the percentage cover.
3.35 Line 198 Commercially valuable for fishing? Aquariums?
For fisheries – clarified in the text
3.36 Line 200 ANOVA assumes that data are continuous, normal distributions,
homogeneity of variance. It seems unlikely that species richness (ie counts at each
site) meets these assumptions.
We have carefully inspected the residual plots and Q-Q plot, and the species richness
data show little deviation from the assumptions of the ANOVA (homogeneity of
variance, normality). We have therefore retained this model, but added a sentence
into our methods confirming that we have checked these assumptions.
3.37 Was biomass simply the estimate of body weight for each fish and were
biomass values for ANOVAs simply grouping these estimated weights among all
species regardless of community composition at each site?
For the overall fish biomass by depth and site, yes, the biomass values were the total
estimated body weights of all fish recorded on a transect. For the later analysis
(Table 3), we grouped the biomass per family, and analysed at family level.
3.38 Line 210 No need to state the function used. Instead tell the reader what the
function does.
Added in an explanation of the function
3.39 Line 220 delete “crucially” and revise to clarify..”the significant interaction
between depth and protection indicates that…”?
Done
3.40 Line 222 For a point in the Discussion…it seems that gorgonian cover may have
a lot to do with wave exposure or other environmental variability between sites.
While we agree that wave exposure is a major structuring agent of Caribbean
gorgonian shallow reefs, at 55 m depth the direct effects of wave exposure is
negligible. Even in the shallows, as all sites are on the same coastline—facing the
same direction—there is limited variation in wave exposure between them. We
believe that current strength/exposure if a more likely agent at these depths, and
have revised the discussion and consider the effects of current variability on MCE
sites.
3.41 Line 230 The differences between deep and shallow were statistically
compared?
Yes, see Table 1.
3.42 Line 231 This suggests a difference in reef type. This could be talked about in
the Discussion or the analysis could use a stratified design to make habitats more
comparable.
This was our motivation behind conducting the RDA analysis with the non-living
benthic data removed and the percentage of the other benthic categories
recalculated. We have added a sentence to our results to make this aim clearer.
3.43 Line 236 Standardized by just removing non living substrate and recalculating
percent composition without it?
Yes, clarified in the text.
3.44 Line 243-244 this result would be easier to see if the figure was color coded to
show levels of protection and not site.
Previously the colours indicated sites and the shapes indicated protection status. We
have now adjusted the figure so that this colour variation is removed, which should
hopefully make the protection differences easier to see. We did not switch the colour
to indicate protection status as we wished to keep the figure consistent with Figure 5
to avoid confusing readers by using colour to indicate depth in one figure and
protection in another.
3.45 Lines 247-249 move to the Discussion
Done
3.46 Line 264-266 There is very little discussion regarding differences in community
composition among depths. Considering doing an NMDS analysis to summarize and
visualize the differences.
We have now run an NMDS analysis of fish communities. This is included as Figure 5,
and there is now consideration of this in the results and discussion section.
3.47 Line 268-271 Following the thought process above, comparing biomass of all
fish species does not seem very informative if community composition is different
(ie maybe the community is dominated by smaller bodied fish). I’m not sure if the
point of the biomass analyses are to provide information about some sort of
biological carrying capacity, but other than that rationale I don’t think it’s
appropriate to compare by combining all species when we know that taxonomic
composition differs. One option that the authors can try may be to revise biomass
analyses by standardizing for each species – possibly calculate the deviation in
biomass for each species from the mean for that species and then scale those values
to basically obtain z scores that are comparable among all species. This would then
tell you if among all species, the biomass tends to be higher or lower than expected
given the taxonomic composition.
Thank you for this suggestion. We have retained the original analysis, as from a
management perspective we are interested in what the total biomass of all fishes,
but in particular commercially valuable fishes are on these MCEs. We have now
taken a community ecology approach to do an NMDS plot, as per your suggestion.
We then do a PCOA which we correlate with the fish biomass of individual species,
allowing us to identify individual fish species driving these community patterns.
While this is not the analysis that the reviewer suggested here, we believe that this
approach addresses the reviewers concern as it breaks apart the biomass into
individual species and identifies those species responsible for driving the patterns
observed.
3.48 Lines 274-280 Unnecessary
Substantially shortened down to a single sentence, but the point is still made to
explain why we retained depth in the model.
3.50 Line 285-286 Unclear sentence
This has been removed from the revised manuscript.
3.51 Line 290-291 This is the first mention in the text of these commercially valuable
species. They seem to be valuable for aquariums? Or are there local artisanal
fisheries? Please state this in the Methods.
Now added to the methods, these are fisheries value based on a mixture of local
artisanal fisheries and global trade for wild-caught fishes.
3.52 Line 295 Again, species composition is different. I’m not sure how informative
this analysis is.
We have retained, and addressed in the discussion in relation to the depletion of
large groupers in Cozumel/this region of the Mexican Caribbean.
3.53 Line 319 This is an overstatement of the findings. MCEs may be capable of
serving as refuges because they share some taxa. But there is not evidence here to
suggest that they ARE serving as refuges.
We have toned this language down, the sentence now reads: ‘This supports the idea
that MCEs could—by virtue of their depth—receive some protection from adjacent
shallow reef disturbance.’ This supports the idea that MCEs could—by virtue of their
depth—have some protect from adjacent shallow reef disturbance.
3.54 Line 321-322 It’s worth mentioning that corals are one of the most threatened
groups in shallow reefs.
Now added that shallow reef hard corals are threatened.
3.55 Line 325 Why is >500 mm the cutoff for large body fishes? There needs to be
some rationale for why this is considered large for the area.
This is now brought together in a paragraph in the discussion that highlights that
until the mid-1990s there were regular sightings of grouper up to 880 mm in the
region. While the 500 mm number is arbitrary, it is just used to illustrate the near-
absence of larger fish from an area where they were historicallypresent.
3.56 Also, it seems that many large body fish would be quite mobile. They would be
able to swim away from the cameras, and possibly move between shallow and
deeper habitats.
We agree that most large body fish are mobile. However, diver evasion is a criticism
of all in-water based fish transect surveys; it is not limited to our stereo-video work.
Work on diver evasion by large fishes has indicated this is mostly a problem in areas
with large spear fisheries (e.g. see Lindfield et al. 2014, Gray et al. 2016). As
spearfishing is absent from Cozumel (with the exception of lionfish removal) we have
no reason to suspect this is a major bias. Studies elsewhere on the Mesoamerican
Barrier Reef of similar reef types and similar fisheries pressures have found that—
while biases based on fish size exist—the magnitude of these differences are not
enough to alter detectability of fishes (Andradi-Brown et al 2017).

3.57 Line 333-334 This study has no evidence that hard corals are the main
structural habitat. Sponges appear to be more abundant.
Corrected
3.58 Line 342 Inverted grammar
Corrected
3.59 Line 349 But the habitats are patch reefs. An entirely different reef structure
and the design was not stratified.
We controlled for this in the RDA benthic analysis, and this still indicated that there
were differences.
3.60 Lines 350-353 Consider rephrasing. These sentences suggest that the findings
of this paper are not robust.
Rephrased and moved to the paragraph on general limitations.
3.61 Line 356-357 Were the coral species different on shallow reefs and MCEs? This
is the case in some Caribbean reefs and an important point of discussion.
Yes, these were, there is a paragraph later in the discussion that focuses on this
under the section on ‘Community ecology across shallow reefs to MCEs around
Cozumel’
3.62 Line 360-362 Also differences between sites. Exposure, light, flow regime?
Yes, we have added a paragraph discussing this in more detail later in the section.
3.63 Line 363 There is no evidence in this paper that gorgonians are a better
indicator. Please resive the sentence...high densities of gorgonians support previous
studies suggesting that gorgonians are a better indicator of MCEs…
We did not say gorgonians are a better indicator. We said that they might be better
indicators, as our results show that even after controlling for latitude effects,
gorgonian cover is different between sites adjacent to disturbance and those
protected. We have revised this sentence to use more cautious language but
retained it.
3.64 Line 372-374 Again, I think it’s important to compare fish community
composition among depths before directly drawing conclusions based on biomass.
We have now added Figure 5 and Table 3 to do this.
3.65 Lines 379-382 Unclear. Please clarify. Also, do not refer to figures in the
Discussion.
Text has been edited to improve and reference to the figures has been removed.
3.66 Line 382-383 The final sentence isn’t necessary.
We have retained this sentence as we have removed a large amount of material
from this paragraph, which we believe now makes this final sentence necessary.
3.67 Line 385 What kind of fish (should be in results) and again, why is 500 mm the
cutoff? Please provide a citation.
Yes, the number and species of these fish are provided in the results section. As
stated before, the 500 mm cutoff is just a number that we used to highlight the lack
of big fish when compared to other studies in the discussion that highlighted that
grouper up to 880 mm were recorded in the area as recently as the mid-1990s. Our
point is just to show that these larger fish are now absent.
3.68 Line 396 This paragraph needs a concluding sentence to remind the reader
what the results of this study show us.
Now added.
3.69 Line 407 This may not be possible given the number of sites, but can these
analyses be framed in a regression framework to mitigate the issues this grouping
among sites based on depth and protection even though the environment may
differ among sites? Possibly based on distance from disturbance?
Thank you for this suggestion, based on this we have now included latitude in our
models. This allows us to test for effects of protection and depth after controlling for
any variation associated with the latitude of the site. We have updated the methods,
results and discussion sections to reflect this.
3.70 Line 411-412 Delete the sentence: ”However the greatest….flow is restricted”.
This is not relevant to this study since it’s not in a lagoon.
Now removed.
3.71 Line 414-415 Please describe how and why this current gradient is a primary
driver of declines i n the north. The flow is south to north? Shouldn’t the location of
the protected area then seed the degraded and impacted reefs in the north with
larvae? This seems like an beneficial design.
Yes, this is what we meant, though on rereading I agree that we were not clear in
our point. We state that as current flows from the south to the north, and the
disturbance is in the north, it is unlikely that the current would be responsible for
carrying any marine pollution/sediment etc. to affect the southern reefs. We have
rewritten this in the main text to be clearer.
3.72 Line 416 the final sentence is unnecessary.
Edited to be more meaningful.
3.73 Line 430 change “is not” to “are not”
Done
3.74 Line 432 Have not changed since what time period? State the time frame for
the reader
Now added.
3.75 Line 436 Structural habitat was not measured in this study (ie rugosity or some
other metric was not measured), so this sentence seems unsupported by the study.
Now removed reference to structural habitat.
3.76 Line 444-447 seems to negate and diminish the results of the study. Consider
doing a power analysis if this is a concern.
Now rewritten, as the original Table 2 that caused us to make this point has been
removed and replaced with a more detailed species level analysis in the form of
Table 3.
3.78 Line 450 Why would diver avoidance be worse on deeper reefs?
Now removed so not relevant to the manuscript. There is evidence of habituation
effects on to divers on some frequently dived locations, these effects may not be
consistent below the depth limit of recreational divers on MCEs.
3.79 Line 452-453 temper the wording here. Possibly less likely to drive the
differences, but I’m not sure it’s unlikely
This has now been removed from the manuscript.
3.80 Line 454-454 delete the final sentence
This has now been removed from the manuscript.
3.81 Line 463 typo
This has now been removed from the manuscript.
3.82 Line 474 consider expanding this. What upstream locations?
Now expanded to identify the main sites that are upstream on the Cozumel
coastline.
3.83 Line 479-480 Awkward sentence structure. Also, it is unclear what is meant by
“established” benthic community.
‘Established’ has been removed, and the sentence structure has been revised.
3.84 Line 481 Specify that these are local disturbances and remind the reader what
results support this.
Now stated the local disturbances, and linked results into the second half of the
sentence.
3.85 Line 486-487 Consider revising. This statement seems very simplistic
considering the stakeholder that are involved in MPA designations. Possibly revise
to….”can be easily incorporated…”?
Revised
3.86 Line 501 Remind the reader why the results don’t support the view.
Added
3.87 Line 516 This seems to negate line 501. Or is line 501 stating that the reefs
need active protection beyond being naturally protected?
Yes, the original L501 was meant to be make the point MCEs need active protection.
We have revised the sentence and made this clearer.
3.88 Table 1. Check formatting
Revised
3.89 Figure 1. Add labels or modify the legend so that the MCE and shallow reef
sites are labeled. These designations are more important to the reader than the site
names. It is very difficult to visualize the location of the sites from this figure and it
makes the results difficult to follow.
Revised, while this was visible from the original legend we agree that it was not
obvious. We have made this legend much more readable.
3.90 Figure 3. Considering changing the color coding to show protected vs not
protected. Or add shapes.
We have not changed the colour, as we wanted to keep consistent with Figure 5.
However, we have made the shapes much more obvious to indicate the difference
between protected vs unprotected sites.
3.91 Figure 4. Add asterisks to show significance.
We did not because this is not a pairwise comparison, the statistics for these results
are reported in the text and have been added to the Figure legend.
3.92 Figure 5. These plots could show 95% confidence bands for protected and non-
protected rather than the combined distributions.
This grey area does represent the 95 % confidence band for the difference between
the two distributions. i.e. over the length ranges where the recorded length
distributions enter this grey zone the distributions are not significantly different. We
have clarified this in the figure legend.

RE: Manuscript reference: RSOS-180835
Dear Prof Padian,
Please find attached a revised version of our manuscript, titled “Assessing
Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems inside and outside a Caribbean Marine
Protected Area” which we would like to be considered for publication in
Royal Society Open Science.
We are delighted that you have agreed to accept our manuscript subject to
the minor changes recommended by the reviewers. The comments of the
two reviewers were highly insightful and enabled us to improve the quality of
our manuscript. Attached with the manuscript, please find attached our
point-by-point responses to each of the concerns raised by the reviewers,
along with references to the changes in the manuscript.
The most significant changes include: We have updated the introduction,
adding in new references to bring this up-to-date with the most recent
literature (given that the original manuscript was first submitted to RSOS for
review in May 2017 there have been several important relevant new studies
published since then). Following the suggestion by reviewer 3, we have
provided more detail in our methods section, especially with respect to our
RDA analysis. In addition, we have made numerous smaller edits to the paper
following suggestions from the reviewers. All co-authors have read and
agreed to the manuscript.
We hope that the revisions in the manuscript and our accompanying
responses will be sufficient to make our manuscript suitable for publication
in Royal Society Open Science. We look forward to hearing from you at your
earliest convenience.
Yours sincerely,
Erika Gress

Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
2.1 You have done an excellent revision of the paper. However, there are
some minor edits I suggest being incorporated to text: In abstract, line 23, it
is redundant to say Cozumel Island. Just mention Cozumel. In the Material
and methods explain it is an island.
Thank you. We have deleted ‘Island’ (line 25)
2.2 In line 24, need to insert the Mexican Caribbean instead just Caribbean.
Done (line 26)
2.3 In line 29, the term MPA (marine protected area) does not apply for
Mexico since the Cozumel protected area the paper refer to is a natural
protected area according to environmental law in Mexico.
The IUCN globally accepted definition of a marine protected area is: ‘A clearly
defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated, and managed, through
legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of
nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values’ (IUCN WCPA,
2018). Even when the marine protection around Cozumel may officially be
designated or labelled under Mexican law as a ‘National Park’ and not a
‘Marine Protected Area’, this does not preclude it from including a MPA. The
Mexican Government also officially considered Cozumel National Park a MPA,
as it includes it within it’s submission to the Convention on Biological Diversity
Aichi Target 11 – protecting 10% of their marine and coastal areas in marine
protected areas. Therefore, we have continued referring to the marine zone in
the Cozumel National Park as MPA, since it includes a marine protected area.
2.4 In line 41, the term Cozumel National Park no longer exists. It is a national
park.
We have corrected that all along the manuscript
2.5 Move text included from line 86 to line 114 into Methods section since
you are describing the area. Please, do not use the term National Marine
Park for that one in Cozumel, it is the National Park Arrecifes Cozumel or in
Spanish Parque Nacional Arrecifes de Cozumel.
We have now updated the park to be referred to as ‘Parque Nacional
Arrecifes de Cozumel’ on the first mention, and then Cozumel National Park
subsequently. We have left the text from Line 86 in the Introduction (now line
83), as in the previous version of the manuscript we originally had this text in
the Methods, and the other reviewers specifically asked us to move it out of
the Methods to the Introduction.
2.6 Last paragraph of Introduction has to contain the objectives.
We have made some edits to the last paragraph of the introduction to make
our objectives clearer (line 117).
2.7 At the beginning of Results, remove the expression "After controlling for
the effects of latitude". This latter was a consideration that needed to be
explained in the Methods section. So, begin the Results section by "We
identified differences in....."
Done (line 247)
2.8 In line 242, remove the word "Unsurprisingly"
Done (line 250)
2.9 In line 256, remove this "To further explore differences in benthic
ecological communities between sites within the MPA and those outside, we
removed non-living benthic cover, recalculated the percentage cover, and
then conducted a redundancy analysis (RDA)" and insert in the Methods
section.
Done (line 262)
2.10 Same recommendation for the beginning of the Discussion section: Text
from line 348 to 351 is a consideration that has to be included in the
Methods section.
Text removed from the start of the Discussion, and this information is already
contained earlier in the manuscript. (line 262)
2.11 In line 457 there is a problem with a quotation.
Corrected
2.12 The conclusions have to be the responses to the objectives established.
We believe we have done so.
Reviewer: 3
3.1 This manuscript addresses the potential for mesophotic coral ecosystems
(MCEs) to be buffered from anthropogenic impacts that affect shallow water
coral reefs by comparing fish and benthic community composition between
paired shallow and MCE reefs within and outside of marine protected areas
(MPAs) in Cozumel, Mexico. The author’s take advantage of the MPA design
in Cozumel to test the following hypotheses: 1) If MCEs are buffered from
anthropogenic processes associated with development (proximity to urban
centers), then MCE community composition should be similar regardless of
protection and location. 2) Likewise, if shallow water coral ecosystems are
impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, then those outside of MPAs and in
close proximity to the urban center should show different community
composition that those within MPAs and far from urban centers. One of the
strengths and unique aspects of this manuscript is that it incorporates both
benthic and fish community data to assess the differences among these
ecosystems. Many of the conclusions of the manuscript were broadly
ecological rather than directly addressed the author’s hypotheses,
particularly because data were not available from prior to MPA development
or prior to urban development to compare the impacts of these activities on
coral reefs. Regardless of this limitation, the descriptive nature of the
manuscript makes a valid contribution of our understanding of MCE vs
shallow water coral reefs and lends some insight into the potential buffering
capacity of MCEs. The author’s highlight that, while coral community
composition differs among MCE and shallow reefs, many fish species are
common. This result differs from recent studies (ex: Rocha et al. 2018,
Science) that report substantial differences between fish communities found
in shallow and mesophotic coral ecosystems, and highlights potential
differences in regional (vs more global) patterns. I have some concerns and
comments (adding clarification may help) about the statistical analyses that
are outlined below.
Thank you, we respond to your specific suggestions below.
3.2 Line 19 “inclusion of all ecosystems” seems broad, particularly since this
study isn’t addressing ALL ecosystems that interact with coral reefs (ie open
ocean pelagic, land-based/streams, etc)
We agree with the reviewer that this is a broad statement, but it is the
opening sentence of the manuscript, so it is well accepted to be a broad
sentence. The statement is correct, as the call has been to consider all
ecosystems (including open ocean pelagic, and land based) that interact with
shallow coral reefs in management. However, we have removed ‘all’ (line 21).
3.3 Line 26 similar fish and benthic ecological communities
Updated
3.4 Line 27 recognized shallow reef impacts associated with development?
Done
3.5 Line 28 MCE communities
Done
3.6 Line 28 MCE communities are similar to each other?
Adjusted to now state: ‘Our results show that overall MCE communities are
similar regardless of protection’ (line 30)
3.7 Line 36 This doesn’t need to be added to the abstract but the statement
begs the question: What would be the size distribution of large body fish on a
“healthy” reef.
We agree, and have a section within the discussion which briefly review some
historical records of large grouper being reported on reefs in the region.
While we don’t go into size distribution specifically, our point is the absence
of larger fish in comparison to historical records (line 479).
3.8 Lines 39-42 Biodiversity wasn’t mentioned in the abstract. Is this a major
finding of the study? What about the conclusions associated with the
benefits of preserving unique taxa and also shared taxa (ie a finding from this
study)?
We have now added documenting biodiversity as a major aim of the study
early in the abstract. (line 27)
3.9 Lines 44-45 Could rephrase to just say high biodiversity. “thousands”
doesn’t have much context
Done
3.10 Line 46-47 Are these goods and services a global estimate?
Yes, we have clarified that these are global estimates now and have changed
the reference for a most recent one (line 51).
3.11 Lines 52-53 This would be a good point to bring up how deeper habitats
might support resilience. It’s in the next paragraph but I found myself looking
for it here.
We have brought some of this text from the next paragraph up to this
position (line 57).
3.12 Line 68 to=as
Done
3.13 Line 70-72 There is quite a lot of discussion of black corals and Oculina
throughout the manuscript. I think you need to state that these are non-
photosynthetic corals (at least at Oculina banks but I believe also the black
corals). So the Deep Reef Refugia Hypothesis (DRRH) in relation to
connectivity and seeding shallow photosynthetic coral reefs isn’t relevant in
this context. The examples and case of black corals and protection is still
relevant but only in the context of preserving unique habitats and species
and also that these habitats might be important to fish. Line 72 particular
needs this clarification and extra contexts because the black coral examples
are not particularly relevant/no direct examples of preserving refuges in the
context of the DRRH.
We have edited the wording in this paragraph to clarify that we are referring
to the DRRH in the context of fisheries refuges, i.e. not thermal refuges, but
simply protection by depth. Both economically important fishes and also
black corals previous were recorded on shallow reefs (<30 m depth) in
Cozumel prior to overexploitation, so we are testing whether these species
remain on MCEs.
3.14 Line 80 typo, missing “it”
Added
3.15 Line 83-84 Final sentence is a little awkward
Reworded to: ‘These approaches fit with recently advocated holistic reef
management, considering the ecosystems interacting with shallow coral reefs
in management plans.’ (line 79).
3.16 Line 93-95 typo “renowned”.
Corrected
3.17 Same comment as above regarding non-photosynthetic corals and the
importance of these deeper water habitats vs the context of the DRRH.
We have made some edits to clarify the important of protecting MCEs in their
own right, as suggested. We have clarified in the earlier paragraph that we
are not exclusively using the DRRH to talk about photosynthetic scleractinian
corals surviving bleaching events, but following the broader definitions used
by Baker et al {Baker:2016we} and in the most recent Coral Reefs Mesophotic
special issue (Loya et al. 2016), which incorporates any depth-refuge effect
from human disturbance in the shallows. In this context, shallow reef biased
overexploitation of black corals fits the definition.
3.18 The context of lacking ecological surveys also needs to be spelled out.
Overexploitation is a call for more protection? Additional studies? Potential
vulnerabilities of MCEs without protection?
Expanded now, with several minor edits to the paragraph, and finishing with:
‘This highlights the need for studies at all reef depths, to increase our
understanding of current reef state, and to ensure adequate protection.’ (line
94).
3.19 Line 100 it refers to the document/plan for the MPA?
Yes, we have reworded to make more explicit what is being referred to
3.20 Line 101 need to specify that the MPA plan designated zones.
Added
3.21 Line 113 With unknown consequences to the MCEs?
Added
3.22 Line 120 “remain ecologically similar” implies that this study will be
measuring change. Potentially change to “would/will be ecologically similar”
Changed
3.23 Line 122 This study does not address changes along depth gradients. It’s
more of a factorial design. Shallow protected vs shallow unprotected. MCE
near protection vs MCE outside. Shallow vs MCE inside and outside
protection.
We have edited this sentence to improve clarity.
3.24 136-137 delete “full GPS location for sites are given in ESM 1” and just
refer to ESM 1 in the caption.

3.26 Line 192 Bray-Curtis is typically used for counts of species. Percentages
might be okay with this metric, but please verify in a statistics textbook and
potentially add a citation stating that this is an appropriate dissimilarity index
for percentages. The PRIMER manual and likely Legendre and Legendre have
detailed descriptions of these sorts of analyses as well as references for
relevant papers.
This was also a request from the previous reviewer in the last round of
review. The reference at the end of this sentence was added in the first round
of manuscript revisions, and is the Primer manual by Anderson et al.
{*Anderson:2008uw}. On p32 of this manual Anderson et al. (2008) discuss
that it is appropriate to use Bray-Curtis for percentage cover data for
PERMANOVA. They then analyze a similar benthic percentage cover example
to our data using Bray-Curtis and PERMANOVA. We have now added an
addition short sentence stating: ‘Bray-Curtis is appropriate to be used for
percentage cover (Anderson et al 2008).’
3.27 Lines 195-199 RDA uses Euclidean distances by default (you can do a
distance-based RDA with Bray-Curtis) and not Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. If the
same type of data is being used for both analyses listed in this paragraph
then it should be stated why the second analysis shifts to Euclidean distance
and the first uses Bray-Curtis.
This second analysis uses Euclidean, as we are using a RDA, and as the
reviewer states it is not possible to use Bray-Curtis for RDA. Jari Oksanen,
author of the vegan package in R, has written about this here
(https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-ecology/2014-May/004506.html). In this
he states that even if the data is proportional anyway, then it can be used
with Euclidian distances for RDA analysis.
3.28 Also with respect to these analyses: Are protection and depth included
as factors in the RDA? This could be clarified by including the RDA formula or
stating in. Along those lines, Figure 3 a and b implies that there were two
RDA’s performed. One for shallow reefs and one for MCEs. I assume these
are biplots where protection is a discrete variable in each of these RDAs as an
independent variable (not pictured since these are biplots) and percent
composition was the response variable? The vectors are then showing the
response variables and the colored shapes are the stations/sites? Ultimately,
please explain the methods in more detail and/or include the formulas.
We have expanded the methods section here, and now clarify that we did
indeed conduct two separate RDA analyses. Protection is included as a factor
in these models, but depth is not, as we ran two separate RDAs, one for each
depth zone. We have also provided the model formulas in the main text. The
full R code used is available in the Supplementary Materials for reference. The
new section now reads:
‘To further explore differences in benthic community structure based on
protection at different depths, redundancy analyses were conducted using
the function ‘rda’ in vegan. This redundancy analysis was based on removing
non-living substrate and recalculating the percentage community
composition based on the proportion of all living components of the
community. Non-living benthic cover was removed to standardise for
differences in reef type between depths. Two separate redundancy analyses
were run, using Euclidian distances for the shallow reef and MCE data
separately, using the formula ‘Benthic Percentage Composition ~ Protection +
Site’. Protection was a categorical variable, representing whether a site was
within or outside the MPA.’

3.31 Lines 256-274 There is no data from before the MPA was created so this
is not conclusive evidence that these patterns are because of the MPA. Were
the MPA plans originally designed because of the ecological patterns (ie
more coral at some sites so they put the MPA there?). This can be
incorporated into the discussion but I think there needs to be some
additional context about either the original MPA planning with respect to the
ecological communities or so other references from the region. Or, it that
can’t be done, then simply stating that these are patterns but not causation.
We have been careful throughout the manuscript to not directly say that the
differences in reef condition between sites within the MPA and outside the
MPA are caused by the MPA. Unfortunately, there is no data from prior to the
MPA being established available. The lines the reviewers refer to are in the
Results, so we don’t think this is the best place to discuss the interpretation of
results. We have added several new sentences to the Discussion under the
section ‘Differences between inside and outside MPA for shallow reefs and
MCEs’, stating:
‘Caution must be used when comparing MPA sites with non-protected sites.
Without historical data from prior to MPA designation, it is not possible to
establish whether the observed patterns were directly caused by the MPA.
Therefore, our results should be seen as a status assessment of current
ecological communities inside and outside the MPA, rather than an direct
evaluation of MPA impact.’
3.32 Lines 307-308 How many axes were in the NMDS analysis? Unlike PCA
or other multivariate analyses, the order of axes in NMDS is not associated
with variance explained. Is there a third axis that is not plotted or did the
final result only have 2? This is important to state because axes that aren’t
plotted may show important patterns.
Our NMDS was constrained to 2 axis, so both axis are plotted. We have now
added this information to the methods.
3.33 Line 311 correlated with PCOA axes?
Added
3.34 Lines 330-333 Was body length compared among taxa that were
common between the MPA and non MPA sites? That would provide
information size difference within taxa (potentially fishing pressure or larger
fish moving to protected areas). Comparing size among all taxa may just be a
result of differences in taxonomic composition (for example: more
Pomacentridae (smaller bodies) in one location and more Haemulidae (larger
bodies).
We agree that differences in body length distribution could be caused by
differences in species presence. However, when considering the ecosystem
service benefit (i.e. fisheries provision) the exact identity of the species is not
crucial, so rather than grouping by taxonomic group, we grouped by the
Fishbase commercial classification (see Methods). This allowed us to test for
length differences between all species that are considered highly valuable for
fisheries.
3.35 Lines 339-341 More small fish in the MPA seems counter intuitive if it’s
due to fishing. Potentially could be associated with higher recruitment to
“better” habitats? Potentially add to the discussion.
We think the reviewer as misinterpreted our results here, we found more
smaller fish on shallow reefs outside of the MPA.
3.36 Line 341 What is the cutoff for “large” fish?
This is a somewhat arbitrary term, but in this sentence we define it as >500
mm length. We have a Discussion paragraph on this cut off and large fish in
Cozumel in general, where we compare our results in the context of previous
Cozumel shallow reef fish assessments that recorded significant numbers of
groupers up to 880 mm length (line 479).
3.37 Lines 349-351 These two considerations (particularly the second)
highlight that Oculina/black coral examples may not be the most appropriate
(mentioned in comment above)
This text has now been removed from the manuscript. We have clarified that
the DRRH as we are referring to it should not be limited to zooxanthellate
scleractinian corals, but all species that face differential threat intensity
across a depth gradient.
3.38 Line 351-352 …differences in MCE benthic communities..
Corrected
3.39 Line 352 “relatively small” is a bit subjective
We agree, and have now removed the word ‘relatively’. In the next
paragraph, however, we explain exactly what the differences are and place
them in context, so this should help address the subjective nature of
discussing the magnitude of the difference.
3.40 Line 353 not sure what you mean by “many MCE benthic groups appear
similar regardless of shallow reef state? Benthic communities in MCEs
differed less than shallow benthic communities? Needs to be rephrased a bit.
Changed
3.41 Lines 355-356 There is little results/discussion about particular species,
so it would be better to stick with the community context rather than
species-specific. A shift in community with fewer hard coral taxa?
We have removed the abundance part of the sentence here, as we agree that
we don’t present individual hard coral species abundance data in the
manuscript. However, we have kept the reference to presence/absence of
hard corals, as we have a table (ESM8) providing all these data.
3.42 Line 366 are they patch reefs? Consider replacing “so also” with
therefore or “therefore also”.
They are not patch reefs in the classic sense of built up coral bommies with
large areas of sand between then, therefore we have left our description as
before. We have replaced ‘so also’ with therefore.

data? Are the low values a result of fishing/mortality or were they always

Deleted ‘highly’. Expanded sentence to contrast to historical length
distributions (line 479).
3.52 Lines 493-497 This thought process and link between the results of this
study and the call for protection needs to be expanded.
We have edited this text to clarify that we are referring to the existing MCE
protection within the MPA, and make a brief recommendation to the
National Park. (lines 416, 529).
3.53 Lines 497-499 This paragraph needs a concluding sentence. For
example, the planning may be easier, and is there also a positive result?
We have added an expanded closing sentence (line 513).
3.54 Lines 500-508 These are new idea, results, and data within the context
of this paper. It’s interesting, but may not deserve an entire paragraph
devoted to lionfish considering it wasn’t discussed earlier.
We agree that this is an important interesting finding. We have retained this
paragraph, but have moved it at the end of the community ecology discussion
section (line 492).
3.55 Line 513 typo- “suggests that”
Added
3.56 Lines 513-514 This conclusion seems overstated. Low commercial fish
biomass may not be the result of fishing or lack of protection. It may be the
ecology of the fish. There is not historic data presented at the reefs that
would support this statement.
We have now cited several studies at this point that support the idea that low
commercial fisheries biomass of both fish and black coral species is as a result
of overexploitation and anthropogenic impacts, and that they are not
naturally low.
3.57 Lines 521-523 What part of this study supports the need to protect
these deeper reefs and harvesting regulations. I think it needs to be directly
stated. As it is this seems like a bit of jump.
