The manuscript describes an interesting example model for a three-polarised antenna that
provides increased communication capacity for the cases considered in the paper. There is some
overlap with two conference papers previously published by the same or similar authors (both in
terms of minor blocks of text and figures). However, the current manuscript is far more
comprehensive than either of the two previously published papers (only a few pages each). The
paper is well-written and the English is of an excellent standard. The only concerns that I had
with regard to the technical work were related: the restriction of the results to very short
distances (less than 20m, but often less than 3m in the figures), and the representation of the
antenna properties. The restriction to very short ranges mean that the signal in the third
orthogonal direction is non-negligible (in the text, the authors acknowledge that the signal in the
direction of travel is negligible in the far field limit) but, in such cases, I am not 100% convinced
that the antenna model that is being used is adequate for complex geometries. I would like the
authors to address this more fully, since the actual geometry of the antennas in the near field limit
is fairly critical. A minor point that I would also question as well is the choice of 60GHz as the
operating frequency. Near 60 GHz, the atmospheric attenuation is a maximum (approx. 15
dB/km). Typically, mmW radars (with which I'm more familiar) operate at 35GHz, 94GHz or
120GHz, to reduce the attenuation of the atmosphere. A more detailed comment on the
atmospheric attenuation would be helpful to explain this.
I did have some trouble with associating the figures with the figure labels and the points in the
text but I think that this is a problem with the pdf generated rather than the authors or the
manuscript per se. The figure files may have been uploaded in the wrong order when preparing
the document.

This letter presents a very interesting analysis about Millimetre-Wave Polarisation Diverse
MIMO Capacity, showing that the inclusion of a third orthogonal dipole provides orientation
robustness in this setting, as well as in a rich scattering environment, by means of a Rician fading
channel model covering all orientations for a millimetre-wave, tri-orthogonal, half-wave dipole
transmitter and receiver employing polarisation diversity.
This is an interesting work, however, I cannot recommend this manuscript for publication due to
the fact that it is not easy to follow explanation as scenario simulation setup is implemented. In
this sense, figures displaying corresponding average channel capacity may be not rightly
understood. How Eq. (21) is numerically computed? In this way, how misalignment has influence
in the proposed configuration? These aspects are not clear and they must be explained in a
greater detail.

n below.
t regards,
holas P. Lawrence
iewer#1: The manuscript describes an interesting example model for a three-polarised antenna that
vides increased communication capacity for the cases considered in the paper.
hor reply: We thank the reviewer for this kind comment. We agree that this paper provides an
resting example of how channel capacity may be increased through a specific tri-orthogonal
gn.
iewer#1: …: the restriction of the results to very short distances (less than 20m, but often less than 3m
he figures), and the representation of the antenna properties. The restriction to very short ranges mean
the signal in the third orthogonal direction is non-negligible (in the text, the authors acknowledge that
signal in the direction of travel is negligible in the far field limit) but, in such cases, I am not 100%
vinced that the antenna model that is being used is adequate for complex geometries. I would like the
hors to address this more fully, since the actual geometry of the antennas in the near field limit is fairly
cal.
hor reply: The paper is based on 60GHz short-range and wireless personal area network (WPAN)
munication, following work undertaken principally in references (7), (8), and (19). Distances used in
AN are typically of the order of a few metres (wireless data storage and periphery control). Short -range
munications (reference (7, page 10)) consider transmitted power over a link distance of 10m.
erence (19) considers propagation over a link of 20m. As such, the distances considered in this paper
typical of the links described.
specific case of a tri-orthogonal dipole configuration at the transmitter and receiver is described from a
damental physical standpoint, and the paper highlights a resulting increase in capacity performance
r a conventional dual polarised arrangement as a result of mitigation of antenna misalignment, thereby
viding orientation robustness. The paper emphasises that this improvement in channel capacity
ormance is without any increase in transmit power and may occur over a link devoid of a scattering
hanism, which is typically not observed at lower microwave frequencies (references (11), (12), (13)).
le we acknowledge that any signal component in the direction of propagation is negligible in the far-
, this is taken into consideration in the analysis. This manifests itself as a small drop in capacity
ormance at the field-of-view (FoV) centre in both AWGN and Rayleigh channels. It is more prevalent in
AWGN channel as no scattering mechanism exists to scatter a polarised signal transmitted from dipole z
he receive antenna at the FoV centre. This is seen in Figure 10. Propagation over the Rayleigh channel
oduces a strong scattering mechanism enabling multipath fading to occur, hence providing a
hanism for all polarisations to be incident at the receiver. This results, in the worst case, in an
gnificant disadvantage being observed at the FoV centre. A decrease in capacity at the FoV centre may
seen in Figures 12, 13 and 14. As this is the position where optimum performance occurs for a dual
rised system, this is seen as acceptable for enhanced performance over the majority of the FoV, in
er words in the instance of antenna misalignment.
model provides analysis covering all antenna orientations of a tri-orthogonal dipole arrangement that,
ially, is phase-centered so as to avoid pattern distortion in the far field. The principal author thanks the
ewer for his attention to detail, as he has completed the design of a physical tri-orthogonal antenna
uiring this condition be met, which he has recently submitted for publication. Figures 4 and 5 provide
phical representation of gain and polarisation mismatch over all orientations, and these data are used in
Friis equation (8) to provide the subchannels of the channel matrix in equation (20), which are used to
ulate capacity according to equation (21).
hor action: In the Discussion, we emphasise the importance of a phase-centered approach, so as to
id pattern distortion in the far field. We equally suggest that the inclusion of phased feeding techniques
ns the possibility of beamsteering, through superposition of individual dipole radiation patterns. A tri-
ogonal design allows for such an approach. We provide an additional reference (35) in the manuscript
lighting a phase-centred tri-orthogonal antenna design providing a high degree of mutual isolation
ween polarisations. As we consider a fundamental approach, we have not applied phasing techniques,
we assume no mutual dipole coupling and perfect decorrelation of signals. We make this point clear in
Discussion.
iewer#1: A minor point that I would also question as well is the choice of 60GHz as the operating
uency. Near 60 GHz, the atmospheric attenuation is a maximum (approx. 15 dB/km). Typically, mmW
ars (with which I'm more familiar) operate at 35GHz, 94GHz or 120GHz, to reduce the attenuation of the
osphere. A more detailed comment on the atmospheric attenuation would be helpful to explain this.
hor reply: The paper uses references (7), (8), and (19) as guides to operational frequencies. We have
phasised the work is for short-range applications such as WPAN communication.
hor action: We have added references (32), (33), and (34) to emphasise work on communications
ems being undertaken at a frequency of 60GHz.
iewer#1: I did have some trouble with associating the figures with the figure labels and the points in the
but I think that this is a problem with the pdf generated rather than the authors or the manuscript per
The figure files may have been uploaded in the wrong order when preparing the document.
hor reply: Thank you for the notification.
hor action: We will rectify this in any subsequent submission.
iewer#2: This is an interesting work, however, I cannot recommend this manuscript for publication due
he fact that it is not easy to follow explanation as scenario simulation setup is implemented. In this
se, figures displaying corresponding average channel capacity may be not rightly understood. How Eq.
is numerically computed? In this way, how misalignment has influence in the proposed configuration?
se aspects are not clear and they must be explained in a greater detail.
hor reply: We thank the reviewer for his comment on the interesting nature of the work. Tri-orthogonal
gn is indeed becoming relevant in personal communications, and the ability to understand the benefits
m a fundamental standpoint are seen as crucial in deriving full benefit from such a technique.
presented model examines link propagation between two antennas, consisting of a tri-orthogonal
le arrangement. As shown in Figure 3, the receiver is moved upon a sphere, covering all possible
ntations as, beyond a certain angle, the performance of the tri-orthogonal arrangement simply repeats
lf. In this instance, this provides a field-of-view (FoV) for the transmitter which is limited at the point at
ch the receiver sees the transmitter at the horizon. The spherical surface is then represented in 2-D FoV
m with all data pertaining to a certain point on the spherical surface being represented at the equivalent
t on the 2-D FoV surface.
tri-orthogonal arrangement provides 9 subchannels whereas a conventional dual polarised system only
vides 4 subchannels. The gain of each dipole and polarisation mismatch of each subchannel are
vided in 2-D FoV format in Figures 4 and 5 respectively, and form an integral part of channel
ormance as calculated by the Friis equation of Equation (8). In effect, as performance of a subchannel
ps in the tri-orthogonal arrangement, so it increases in another subchannel. Orientation robustness is
erved as a result. The resulting channel matrix, H, is given in equation (20) with its 9 subchannels. A
ventional dual polarised system would only have dipoles (x,y) and (p,q) at its disposal and so would not
vide orientation robustness with only 4 subchannels. This is evident in the performance of many current
t hand circularly polarised (RHCP) patch antennas for GPS receiver systems, which can only provide
ular polarisation performance (equivalent to dual polarisation with a 90° shift between polarisations) at
zenith point. Elliptical polarisation performance is provided as the satellite moves away from this point,
ore finally becoming horizontal polarisation performance at the horizon. This results in reduced gain and
ce receiver performance at the horizon.
hor action: We have added Figure 1 to the manuscript to assist in the understanding of the tri-
ogonal concept and its benefits.

fading in nature? Why?
hor reply: We thank the reviewer for his comment on the interesting nature of the work.
h regard to how Eq. (21), given below, is calculated, we add additional comments to our last author
y. The equation is given below,
his manuscript we have 3 transmitter and 3 receiver elements (or dipoles). Elements at the transmitter T
orthogonal to each other, as they are at the receiver R. Receiver R is allowed to move on the surface of
here, while T remains fixed. There are 3 signals sent from T, and 3 ways of receiving each of these
als at R. This provides 9 subchannels for a signal to get from T to R, which determines the size of the
nnel matrix H, with M rows and N columns.
every increment of a and <U+03B8>T within the field of view (FoV), we generate a new set of variables that are
d to generate the channel matrix H, as in Eq.20 of the manuscript. As we have 3 elements at both T and
e have our 9 possible subchannel paths, or links for transmission from T to R. We calculate each of the
bchannel elements, or coefficients, h in Eq. 20 according to the Friis equation (Eq.8), given below, using
values obtained for each subchannel link. Eq. 8 gives the LoS power transfer coefficient for each dipole
, and from these we can determine the subchannel electric field arriving at R as the square root of Eq.8.
hout loss of generality, we assume no phasing, and that dipoles at T are colocated, as are those at R. We
his for all 9 subchannels, giving us our 9 subchannel coefficients, h, in Eq.20,
m Figures 4 and 5, we are able to see how the gains of each element, or dipole, at T and R,, and the 9
channel polarisation alignments between the elements at T and at R change as a function of position of
n the sphere. We note that for dipoles zr, the alignment between these two dipoles is always perfect, as
a radial dipole, and z a vertical dipole. They are in effect, always in the same plane of polarisation. This is
erved in Figure 5(i). The other 8 subchannels are polarisation mismatched to varying degrees, according
he alignment of the dipoles at T and at R.
oles at T are static and are given as x= [100]T, y = [010]T, z = [001]T. Eqs. (14)-(16) determine the
nment of r,p and q. Figures 8 (a) and (b) illustrate how the free space path loss and atmospheric
nuation change over the field of view.
Eq.21, a scaling factor, <U+03C1>/N, allows us to compare like-for-like, ie a system with 3 transmitters
smitting the same power as a system using 2 transmitters. In this instance the advantage of a 3x3 (3x3
rs to 3 receiver elements, and 3 transmitter elements) system is that an identical transmit power to
of a 2x2 system is effectively spread over 3 transmitters, rather than 2. And as they are orthogonal to
h other, so they provide an improved performance towards the edge of the FoV, with only a small
uction in capacity performance at the FoV centre. It is important to understand that the alignment of
les plays a crucial role in this performance. This is often misunderstood.
h a channel matrix being determined for every point in the FoV, we use the Hermitian transpose, as per
references 17, 18, 31 , and the I3 identity matrix to determine the capacity of the 3x3 system. For the 2x2
em, we use the I2 identity matrix, and the 4 subchannels hxp , hyp, hxq, hyq. As N is 2 in this instance, so
scaling factor <U+03C1>/N increases, at the expense of providing orientation robustness at the FoV edge. For
1x1 system, the identity matrix reverts to 1, and the subchannel hxp is used. As N is 1 in this instance, so
scaling factor <U+03C1>/N increases yet again, at the expense of further reducing orientation robustness.
21 is a standard equation that is used to provide a system's capacity performance, and we use this as it
measurement that is fit for purpose in this instance, as we consider a channel matrix consisting of
channels and compare systems using identical transmit power, but arranged in different
figurations2,31.
channel matrix, as it stands, is deemed to be line of sight (LoS) and is devoid of any reflections. At this
ture, we introduce reflections via a complex Gaussian distribution in the second half of Eq.19 below.

The first half of Eq. 19 is the deterministic or LoS component of the channel matrix that we have
ulated through Eq. 8. Through setting the Ricean K factor to 0, we provide an environment where no
(NLoS) signal is propagated, and only reflections are used instead to provide a propagating medium.

ormance via multipath. Multipath components in H increase channel rank (and therefore capacity) as

model provides the extremes of deterministic LoS (AWGN) fading and stochastic Rayleigh, or NLoS
ng, and is deemed to be a Ricean fading model. We apply no phase argument to the signals over the
nnel, and base power transfer over the subchannels on determinable values, in a static LoS
ironment. No shadowing is included in the model, as we wish to provide a model which can have a
der's choice of statistics applied to it. Since signal-to-noise ratio is a determining factor in capacity
ormance, the LoS fading model provides the base case, and we extend this to the other extreme by
viding a Rayleigh fading comparison, to illustrate that a 3x3 system outperforms in both LoS and NLoS
ironments. It is important to stress that we provide this model to consider the effect of transmitter-
iver misalignment, and how to mitigate against it.
leigh fading is typically seen as a case of fast fading, since rapid fluctuations may occur over very short
ances. It can however also be considered as a slow fading mechanism, when the coherence time of the
nnel is large relative to the delay constraint of the channel. In the instance of multipath, the power
ived would be unknown, and so a Rayleigh distribution can be assumed (J. Reig, ‘Fading Evaluation in
60 GHz Band in Line-of-Sight Conditions’, http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/984102. Choi, M.-S. and
sskopf, G. and Rohde, Statistical Characteristics of 60 GHz Wideband Indoor Propagation Channel, DOI:
109/PIMRC.2005.1651506). It should be noted that channel measurements at 60GHz are not abundant.
provide this fading to illustrate that the 3x3 tri-orthogonal arrangement provides improved
ormance in both this instance and in the LoS, or AWGN, fading case. We move the receiver R in order
emonstrate the effect of misalignment. We do not attach any timeframe or relative velocity to this
vement. Any stochastic fading criteria would be typically superpositioned on to the LoS (AWGN fading
imply path loss) case. We show that the 3x3 system spreads transmit power effectively to provide
roved performance over the FoV, compared to the 1x1 and 2x2 systems and, without loss of generality,
have highlighted in the manuscript the assumptions on the channel model that we have applied (AWGN
Rayleigh fading, according to Eq.19).
model illustrates that the 3x3 system is able to provide orientation robustness in both a LoS and a non-
of sight (NLoS or Rayleigh fading) case, with little detriment to capacity at the FoV centre, where the
and 1x1 systems are perfectly aligned. The design of the model shows how spreading transmit power in
ffective manner is able to bring an appreciable improvement to system performance, over the channel
emes highlighted in the manuscript.
hor action: We have included further description of our model, based on our reply above, at relevant
