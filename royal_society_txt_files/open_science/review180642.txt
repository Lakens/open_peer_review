Abstract
In the abstract there are indicated two works connected with the study presented in the paper.
This papers must be simply cited without mentioning details like the publication title and the
journal where are published.
In the abstract should be more clearly discussed on the connection between the notions “opinion
leader” and “central user”.
“Results indicate that not all of the central users may be identified in online communication
network in a long-term manner. Furthermore, we discuss the changing positions of opinion
leaders and their power to keep isolates interested in an online discussion network.”
Must be slightly detailed/extended the explanation with about two sentences.
Introduction
“Recent platforms, such as Twitter is one of the most popular online social networking platform
(microblog) with over 300 million active users per month [2].”
It should be mentioned that this is according to a study performed in what year. The paper in
that is presented is published in 2016.
Page 2
“This study is motivated by the lack of study for prediction of central users and their impact on
communication in an online communication network in a long-term manner.”
You should explain more clearly what you understand by prediction.
“We explore communication patterns among participants of online communication network in
short-term and long-term manner.”
You should explain more clearly the significance of “short-term” and “long-term manner”.
“RQ : Prevalence of central users in long-term social media network?”
You should explain the significance of the word "Prevalence". For readers who are unfamiliar
with it.
“2. Background”
Must be given a more illustrative title in order to better illustrate the content.
“2.1. Conversation starter”, “2.2. Influencer” ….”3.1. Tool” “3.2. Data Source”..
See also all the titles in the paper. Should be given more suggestive titles. For example
"Conversation starter user".
Figure 1 and Figure 2 looks exactly the same.

This is an intriguing paper that attempts to contribute to the understanding of the types of users
in Twitter networks and their relative power in leading opinion. The paper has a solid grounding
in addressing an ongoing debate, but the lack of clarity and robust metrics hold the paper back
significantly. Consequently I do not think it should be published as is, and would benefit from
major revision and redesign of the data analysis approach.
First the research question is ambiguous and unclear. It is not formulated as a question or a
hypothesis, so it is difficult to understand what exactly the authors intend to measure. Is this
simply a contribution that seeks to refine theories from Feng et al with longitudinal data? There
needs to be a clearer articulation of why this matters in the literature. There is no meditation on
the term "prevalence" in the research question: what does prevalence mean in this context? Is it
centrality? If so, centrality is the measure that is used throughout the paper, so what we have is a
research question that seeks to understand the power (which appears to be defined as centrality)
4
of users by measuring their centrality. In this sense, the analysis offered is tautological; I think the
authors would benefit from including different variables.
Second, the metrics used only tell a tiny part of the story. Behind the metrics is a fascinating
process: the centrality of Pakistani news accounts as conversation starters on the Panama Papers.
This is curious to me as it was Süddeutsche Zeitung that broke the story and it made a splash
across the world. Why is it that one country's media had such an influence? This is beside the
research question, but upon checking most of the users in the network, many appear to be based
in Pakistan. For a story of international import, the authors must consider why this is the case.
Could it be that this particular hashtag was popular in Pakistan relative to the publics of other
countries? Does the fact that much of this media is in the English language provide these
accounts with international reach? There is almost no qualitative assessment of the network itself
and without providing this depth, the authors have failed to reflect on the limits of their data
collection approach, or address the more interesting phenomenon of centrality of Pakistani media
in this network. I think there is a really interesting story to tell here, but the fact that many of
these accounts with high centrality come from a particular country needs to be addressed.
Moving on to the measurements themselves, I think they are appropriate for the stated objective
of addressing Feng et al's work on the typology of accounts used here. However, there are many
more tests and metrics that could be used beyond the relatively surface-level analysis of degree
centrality and betweenness centrality. There has not been a turn to the social networks literature
in sociology or media & communication studies that explains why these measures matter; it only
seems to do so via one article (Feng et al's) and a few others. This needs to be developed further.
It holds the paper back because the only measures that seem to be used are these two. There are
numerous other measures of centrality that could be used alongside other measurements. While
the paper does start to use this towards the end (Eg. clustering, modularity, density), it is very
difficult to see what these measures mean in the larger arc of the paper's argument. While I think
the limited critique of the four types of users is an interesting starting point, I finished the paper
with very little sense of why these kinds of users mattered and how they affected discussion on
the Panama Papers. For example, the decrease in modularity over time is interesting and based
on the findings, I would guess that this is due to the drop-off of conversation starters. There are
many further metrics that could be used to explain what has happened in the network over time.
But the analysis lacks description and fails to use a robust theoretical discussion to explain why
these findings are relevant for future scholarship in this area.
Finally, the claim made at the end of the paper, that it has evaluated "variations in power" and
how "very few people are influencing the discussion in the online communication networks"
seems fair, but is not necessarily a finding that makes an original contribution to the literature.
This would be improved with a more robust operationalization of "power" and "influence"
drawing on a broader range of literature.
By the end of the paper I felt a bit lost as to what the authors are actually trying to claim. There is
the interesting point about the relationship between isolates and conversation starters, and I think
this is the kernel of an important contribution. The paper attempts to quantitatively describe a
network and make claims about variations in power, but does little to theorize power in the
context of digital communication (and it could do so with recourse to a vast interdisciplinary
literature). Consequently, I feel the paper does not add much to the ongoing debate on the topic. I
think the authors would be well-served to redevelop their research question and develop a more
robust set of metrics that speak back to the literature (or explain more clearly why they have
selected the metrics they did) and adjust their analysis strategy to focus in on the most important
factors affecting opinion leadership in the #PanamaLeaks network. I suspect that the point about
conversation starters and isolates would be a good place to start.
5
In short, the paper tries to describe the network broadly and in doing so, does not make a clear
argument about variations in power in opinion leadership, missing an opportunity to go beyond
criticizing and refining existing work and provide a fresh look at this process. By focusing the
data analysis, providing some qualitative detail, and thinking critically about concepts such as
"power", I think a future paper could rework the authors' data into an exciting contribution to the
field. As it stands, however, I do not think this paper is ready for publication.
There are also a few issues with grammar in the paper as well as style. These are mostly cosmetic,
but the authors should take more care to carefully proofread prior to submission. These are
mostly small issues that did not impede comprehension and did not affect the decision taken on
the manuscript.
Comments to the editor added into author review:
I do have a concern with ethics in this paper. I think it is important that researchers using this
type of data take into account the ramifications of publishing the names of Twitter accounts that
they use -- this might not be a problem in that my verification of some of these accounts show
that they are public facing, but at the end of the manuscript they write that there are no ethical
concerns. This is not the case; publishing the names of Twitter users has real ramifications
(perhaps not very concerning ones in this case) but this should at least be considered in the ethics
of producing this piece.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have done an excellent job revising this manuscript. It just needs a few, very minor
revisions and I think it is ready to go. I would like to start by saying that the additions to the
paper have made this a much more interesting piece and one that I think would be of much use
to social scientists interested in power and communication flows in networks. The claims of the
paper are significantly clearer, and its clarity on limitations helps us appreciate its contributions.
I would just note a few very minor points:
1. The research question on pg. 3 is not stated as a question. This should just be a quick change, or
just call it a research objective if you prefer not to reword it.
2. As the clustering data is addressed more clearly toward the end of the paper, the sentences
describing the clustering metrics in the body of the sections might be unnecessary. The sentences
are a bit off putting for the reader because they aren't contextualized back into the points being
made about each type of user. I think either the authors can add a sentence briefly describing
what the clustering metrics tell us, or just remove the sentences and just present these points in
the discussion section.
3. While the authors did a good job proofreading the original submission, there are still quite a
few stylistic and grammatical mistakes that at times impede the flow of the argument. I know its
hard to notice these after a certain proximity to one's manuscript but I do think some very
detailed proofreading and editing can make the sentences more concise and comprehensible.
There are quite a few issues throughout the piece, primarily in the discussion section, so it would
be good to have another look over the text for these cosmetic edits.
4. There is a point about proteins in the conclusion and that seemed to come out of nowhere -- it's
an interesting point, but I think the space should be reserved more for the important claims for
social science being made. Perhaps adding that back in as a footnote would be more appropriate.
I think it would require a citation as well to related literature in biology/chemistry (whichever
discipline is more appropriate--that is well outside my knowledge).
All in all, this is an excellent revision of the manuscript and I feel its contributions are clear. This
time around, I felt I learned quite a lot from the paper, and now I am thinking about how these
different characters in networks could be used for the types of networks that I work with. The
piece is significantly improved and makes a useful, original contribution to the field. The authors
did a great job with these changes and I look forward to seeing the final version in the journal.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have done an excellent job revising this manuscript. It just needs a few, very minor
revisions and I think it is ready to go. I would like to start by saying that the additions to the
paper have made this a much more interesting piece and one that I think would be of much use
to social scientists interested in power and communication flows in networks. The claims of the
paper are significantly clearer, and its clarity on limitations helps us appreciate its contributions.
I would just note a few very minor points:
1. The research question on pg. 3 is not stated as a question. This should just be a quick change, or
just call it a research objective if you prefer not to reword it.
2. As the clustering data is addressed more clearly toward the end of the paper, the sentences
describing the clustering metrics in the body of the sections might be unnecessary. The sentences
are a bit off putting for the reader because they aren't contextualized back into the points being
made about each type of user. I think either the authors can add a sentence briefly describing
15
what the clustering metrics tell us, or just remove the sentences and just present these points in
the discussion section.
3. While the authors did a good job proofreading the original submission, there are still quite a
few stylistic and grammatical mistakes that at times impede the flow of the argument. I know its
hard to notice these after a certain proximity to one's manuscript but I do think some very
detailed proofreading and editing can make the sentences more concise and comprehensible.
There are quite a few issues throughout the piece, primarily in the discussion section, so it would
be good to have another look over the text for these cosmetic edits.
4. There is a point about proteins in the conclusion and that seemed to come out of nowhere -- it's
an interesting point, but I think the space should be reserved more for the important claims for
social science being made. Perhaps adding that back in as a footnote would be more appropriate.
I think it would require a citation as well to related literature in biology/chemistry (whichever
discipline is more appropriate--that is well outside my knowledge).
All in all, this is an excellent revision of the manuscript and I feel its contributions are clear. This
time around, I felt I learned quite a lot from the paper, and now I am thinking about how these
different characters in networks could be used for the types of networks that I work with. The
piece is significantly improved and makes a useful, original contribution to the field. The authors
did a great job with these changes and I look forward to seeing the final version in the journal.

gested.
R1C1:
he abstract there are indicated two works connected with the study presented in the paper.
papers must be simply cited without mentioning details like the publication title and the
nal where are published.
he abstract should be more clearly discussed on the connection between the notions “opinion
er” and “central user”.
sults indicate that not all of the central users may be identified in online communication
work in a long-term manner. Furthermore, we discuss the changing positions of opinion
ers and their power to keep isolates interested in an online discussion network.”

Our Response
have revised the sentence according to your suggestion as follows in revised manuscript:
cording to the study performed by Cherepnalkoski et al. in 2016, Twitter is one of the most
ular online social networking platform (microblog) with over 300 million active [2].”
R1C3:

our suggestions. The updated section is highlighted in the revised manuscript.
R1C4:

mments of Reviewer 2.
is an intriguing paper that attempts to contribute to the understanding of the types of users
witter networks and their relative power in leading opinion. The paper has a solid grounding
ddressing an ongoing debate, but the lack of clarity and robust metrics hold the paper back
ificantly. Consequently I do not think it should be published as is, and would benefit from
or revision and redesign of the data analysis approach.
Our Response
nk you for your productive comments. Your comments really helped us to improve the
ity and quality of the manuscript. We have made changes in according to your suggestions
he revised manuscript.
R2C1:
t the research question is ambiguous and unclear. It is not formulated as a question or a
othesis, so it is difficult to understand what exactly the authors intend to measure. Is this
ply a contribution that seeks to refine theories from Feng et al with longitudinal data? There
ds to be a clearer articulation of why this matters in the literature. There is no meditation on
term "prevalence" in the research question: what does prevalence mean in this context? Is it
trality? If so, centrality is the measure that is used throughout the paper, so what we have is
esearch question that seeks to understand the power (which appears to be defined as
trality) of users by measuring their centrality. In this sense, the analysis offered is tautological;
nk the authors would benefit from including different variables.
Our Response
nsion of the work done by Feng is only one of the contribution of this article besides others.
have updated motivation section (1.1) in response to your comment regarding difficulty to
erstand the authors intend. We have also modified the research question as suggested. We
e added your suggestion of using different variables as a future extension of our study. Our
us in this work is communication patterns of central users and these patterns are best
sented by the links between the participants in the online communication network.
R2C2:
ond, the metrics used only tell a tiny part of the story. Behind the metrics is a fascinating
cess: the centrality of Pakistani news accounts as conversation starters on the Panama Papers.
is curious to me as it was Süddeutsche Zeitung that broke the story and it made a splash
oss the world. Why is it that one country's media had such an influence? This is beside the
arch question, but upon checking most of the users in the network, many appear to be based
akistan. For a story of international import, the authors must consider why this is the case.
ld it be that this particular hashtag was popular in Pakistan relative to the publics of other
ntries? Does the fact that much of this media is in the English language provide these accounts
h international reach. There is almost no qualitative assessment of the network itself and
hout providing this depth, the authors have failed to reflect on the limits of their data collection
roach, or address the more interesting phenomenon of centrality of Pakistani media in this
work. I think there is a really interesting story to tell here, but the fact that many of these
ounts with high centrality come from a particular country needs to be addressed.
Our Response
ording to the two-step flow theory of Kartz, information flows from mass media to opinion
ers and then transmitted to the population via opinion leaders. In light of the above, we
cted mass media as our conversation starter. (Section 4.1)
ial media allow citizens to easily post, recommend, and distribute news and political content
others in their online social networks (Kumpel et al. (2016), Weeks et al. (2016)). This
ribution pattern is seen in the online communication network of #PanamaLeaks, where the
ticipants have retweeted, mentioned and replied to the Tweets created by the social media.
rge number of participants sharing/mentioning tweets of social media platform made media
much influential. It is not only the matter in Pakistan. Even in another study, results indicate
one of the social media organization of that country has the biggest impact on the discussion
anor et al. (2016)).
used NodeXl Twitter Search Network data collector to collect tweets from March 2017 to
ust 2017. We used “#PanamaLeaks” keyword to download Tweets without any location
ted parameter. Thus, we do not have any control over the location of Tweets from which they
coming. I agree with your point that the popularity of the #PanamaLeaks Tag used to
nload Tweets can be a factor of getting most Tweets from Pakistan.
ever, Twitter Standard Search API does not guarantee you to acquire full data related to the
htag used to download tweets. This is one of the limitations of our data collection approach.
have added this limitation in (Section 3.2) of the revised manuscript.
R2C3:
ving on to the measurements themselves, I think they are appropriate for the stated objective
ddressing Feng et al's work on the typology of accounts used here. However, there are many
e tests and metrics that could be used beyond the relatively surface-level analysis of degree
trality and betweenness centrality. There have not been a turn to the social networks literature
ociology or media & communication studies that explain why these measures matter; it only
ms to do so via one article (Feng et al's) and a few others. This needs to be developed further.
olds the paper back because the only measures that seem to be used are these two. There are
erous other measures of centrality that could be used alongside other measurements. While
paper does start to use this towards the end (Eg. clustering, modularity, density), it is very
cult to see what these measures mean in the larger arc of the paper's argument. While I think
limited critique of the four types of users is an interesting starting point, I finished the paper
h very little sense of why these kinds of users mattered and how they affected discussion on
Panama Papers. For example, the decrease in modularity over time is interesting and based
he findings, I would guess that this is due to the drop-off of conversation starters. There are
ny further metrics that could be used to explain what has happened in the network over time.
the analysis lacks description and fails to use a robust theoretical discussion to explain why
se findings are relevant for future scholarship in this area.
Our Response
nk you for your positive comment about the selection appropriate measures. We have also
ed the importance of using centrality measures with reference to communication and other
dies of social network literature in accordance with your suggestion (section 3.3-Para 2). We
e also updated the complete (section 5.6) according to your suggestion presenting effects of
tral users on the structure and overall communication between the participants by
sidering parameters like unique users, average clustering coefficient, density, and modularity.
have considered two new metrics reciprocated vertex ratio and clustering coefficient at the
l level for further analysis and understanding of the effects of these highly influential
ticipants on the communication (section 5.6).
R2C4:
lly, the claim made at the end of the paper, that it has evaluated "variations in power" and
"very few people are influencing the discussion in the online communication networks"
ms fair, but is not necessarily a finding that makes an original contribution to the literature.
would be improved with a more robust operationalization of "power" and "influence"
wing on a broader range of literature.
Our Response
nk you for your positive comments. Discussion based on a broader range of literature is
ed in the discussion (section 5.6) of the revised manuscript. However, we used social
work analysis techniques in this study, as our primary focus is the patterns of
munication in social media networks.
R2C5:
he end of the paper I felt a bit lost as to what the authors are actually trying to claim. There
e interesting point about the relationship between isolates and conversation starters, and I
k this is the kernel of an important contribution. The paper attempts to quantitatively describe
etwork and make claims about variations in power, but does little to theorize power in the
text of digital communication (and it could do so with recourse to a vast interdisciplinary
ature). Consequently, I feel the paper does not add much to the ongoing debate on the topic.
nk the authors would be well-served to redevelop their research question and develop a more
ust set of metrics that speak back to the literature (or explain more clearly why they have
cted the metrics they did) and adjust their analysis strategy to focus in on the most important
ors affecting opinion leadership in the #PanamaLeaks network. I suspect that the point about
versation starters and isolates would be a good place to start.
Our Response
esponse to your above comments. We have added details about the on-going topic in the
sed manuscript (section 1-para 6). How these users are effecting communication in
namaLeaks network is added in (section 5.6-para 5). We have updated the paper and added
e discussion based on a broader range of literature in the discussion section in response to
r suggestions. We have also added the importance of using selected parameters in the revised
nuscript (Section 3.3-para 2). Furthermore, we have used new measures for the analysis as
l. We have also presented the effects of these central users on the online discussion at local
global level in revised manuscript based on the point about conversation starters and isolates
well as influential users acting as an information source and their structural positions to
nect communities etc.
R2C6:
hort, the paper tries to describe the network broadly and in doing so, does not make a clear
ument about variations in power in opinion leadership, missing an opportunity to go beyond
cizing and refining existing work and provide a fresh look at this process. By focusing the data
lysis, providing some qualitative detail, and thinking critically about concepts such as "power",
nk a future paper could rework the authors' data into an exciting contribution to the field. As
ands, however, I do not think this paper is ready for publication.
Our Response
have updated manuscript regarding your suggestion. We would like to thank you for your
gestions. We believe your suggestions really helped us to present our work more clearly
m the readers’ point of view.
R2C7:
re are also a few issues with grammar in the paper as well as style. These are mostly cosmetic,
the authors should take more care to carefully proofread prior to submission. These are mostly
ll issues that did not impede comprehension and did not affect the decision taken on the
nuscript.
Our Response
mmatical and style errors are corrected.
R2C8:
have a concern with ethics in this paper. I think it is important that researchers using this
e of data take into account the ramifications of publishing the names of Twitter accounts
t they use -- this might not be a problem in that my verification of some of these accounts
w that they are public facing, but at the end of the manuscript they write that there are no
cal concerns. This is not the case; publishing the names of Twitter users has real
ifications (perhaps not very concerning ones in this case) but this should at least be
sidered in the ethics of producing this piece.
Our Response
esponse to your above comment, we have updated manuscript. In the revised version, we
e removed the original names of individual participants from the text and figures.
