This paper proposed several measures to quantify the effect of diseases on gene pathways and
functional networks and to quantify the distance between diseases and used these measures to
perform hierarchical clustering of diseases. The authors essentially performed unsupervised
learning based on gene networks based on diseases information. The authors may explain in
detail how the analysis results especially those based on the disease distance can be useful in
precision medicine (as claimed by the authors), in comparison to many developed methods in the
literature for predicting disease based on gene information, it is unclear
The authors should have explained the scientific motivations for defining those quantities and for
performing clustering of diseases.

“Diseases classification via gene network integrating modules and pathways.”
Associate Editor's comments (Professor Joris Veltman):
The manuscript by Zhilong et al. provides important new approaches to disease classification. While
the results section is extensive, I do miss a thorough discussion of the use of this in the clinic. A
better motivation of the choice for the gene network based approach needs to be provided as well
as a thorough discussion on the potential impact of applying this approach in disease classification.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. We have discussed this question in the section
‘Discussion’, as following:
1) The motivation of the choice for the gene network based approach. (2nd paragraph in
Discussion)
Most of the successful studies building on these new approaches have focused on a single disease
or a class of diseases to gain a better understanding. Recent progress in genetics and genomics
has led to an appreciation of the effects of gene mutations in virtually all disorders and provides
the opportunity to study human diseases all at once rather than one at a time. Under the key
hypothesis that a disease phenotype is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single effector
gene product but reflects various pathobiological processes that interact in a complex network[32],
the network-based approaches offer the possibility of discerning general patterns and correlations
of human disease not readily apparent from the study of individual disorders[22]. To address the
fundamental challenge of modern biomedical research that understanding how diseases that are
similar on the phenotypic level are similar on the molecular level[4], our focus is on classifying
diseases based on pathways impacted and supporting combination therapy between diseases as
evidence. The distances between diseases based on the human gene network and pathways are
defined to evaluate the similarity of diseases, even the similarity of gene-targeted therapies.
2) The potential impact of applying this approach in disease classification. (7th to 9th
paragraphs in Discussion)
Disease classification is a progression towards precision medicine with the need for precise
patient characterization, currently based on clinical phenotypes but in future augmented by
laboratory-based tests[60]. As illustrated in Fig.8, researchers of hospitals and institutions obtain
molecular data of patient samples for diseases of concern. Their great studies have been providing
valuable guidance to precision medicine from many aspects, such as providing predictive,
prognostic, diagnostic, and surrogate markers of diverse disease states, informing on underlying
molecular mechanisms of diseases, allowing for classification of patients based on molecular data
etc. Our work (the blue part) is an extension on their basis, firstly, because the data we need, for
example, disease genes are identified and summarized in previous researches. Secondly, the direct
application of genetic information can be considered as first-order, while the human gene network
is an integration of genetic information, which is high-order. Thirdly, our classifications of
diseases are at a system level, designed to provide novel insights for the clinic practice at the
sample level, for example a repositioning of our understanding of diseases and exploration the
potential of combination therapy. Also, our results of diseases classifications may complement
each other with the classification of complications, as a clear definition of complications is
essential in medicine, mainly aiming to improve quality in patients' care. The lack of method for
uniform reporting of complications both in terms of definition and grading prompted the authors
to propose a classification system of complications based on combining outcome and severity of
sequelae[61]. The integration of such work will play a role in guiding combination therapy.
Moreover, the enormous complexity of common diseases and the resulting problems, such as the
fact that many patients do not respond to treatment and the increasing costs of drugs and drug
development, provide strong motivation for new and complementary strategies for research and
clinical practice[62]. The network based approaches classifying diseases based on pathways
impacted have the potential to substantially enable the elaboration of a network based view of
drug discovery and reposition (the application of known drugs to new indications), which are
challenging issues in pharmaceutical science[63,64].
Prior to clinical implementation, major challenges must be addressed from a clinician's
perspective, including understanding how network approach based genomic science is generated
and linked to patient-oriented science, which is the framework for evaluating genomic studies, as
an evidence base for providing effective precision medicine to patients in the future[65]. The
diseases studied in our work are far more than other researches, not limited to cancers or certain
diseases. This fact may lead to our results extensive, however, it may guide people to pay attention
to some unexpected points.
A comprehensive description of the associations between pathways and diseases requires
identification of not only multiple pathways associated with a specific disease but also pathways
associated with multiple diseases. In 9,125 tumors, Sanchezvega et al. point out significant
representation of individual and co-occurring actionable alterations in 10 signaling pathways[29].
Meanwhile, we find that most of the 10 signaling pathways are subject to significant influence
by diseases, including Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Notch signaling
pathway, p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle pathway, Ras signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling
pathway, Wnt signaling pathway. The current understanding of the hippo pathway, for example,
has been reviewed with an emphasis on the effects of this pathway on basic biology and human
diseases including cancers, immunity and cardiovascular diseases[66]. Another review shows that
individuals with RASopathies share many overlapping characteristics, including cardiac
malformations, short stature, neurocognitive impairment, craniofacial dysmorphy, cutaneous,
musculoskeletal, and ocular abnormalities, hypotonia and a predisposition to developing
cancer[67]. These results suggest resemblance between cancer diseases and non-cancer diseases,
and implies opportunities for targeted and combination therapies. Integrative analysis methods
have been proposed to improve power and reproducibility for identifying genes and prognosis
markers associated with multiple cancers, which may lead to discovery of novel therapeutic
targets for cancer therapies[68,69]. In addition, it estimates the effect (either positive or negative)
of the same gene in different diseases, which helps predict possible side effects of the drug.
Supported by our classification of diseases, similar applications can be implemented between
cancer diseases and non-cancer diseases to discover biomarker targets and improve drug
development for multiple diseases that are classified in the same category.
Also, it is important to have the paper checked for spelling mistakes.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. We have checked and corrected the spelling mistakes
in the manuscript.

The manuscript is dedicated to the diseases classification, which is the foundation for achieving

models from the perspective of gene network modules and pathways. In addition, the authors were
trying to perform different classification models of diseases taking account of intensity and scope
of the impact of the disease on pathways. The study is solid and the results reported are interesting.
After close evaluation the manuscript I have some comments and questions:
1 The authors summarized many databases of different institutions and organizations in the
introduction, why not combine all databases but only used data from NCBI and KEGG?
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. In our manuscript, human gene information, gene-
gene interactions, disease genes and pathway genes are need. The reason that we get the data from
NCBI and KEGG are as follows:
NCBI provides a large suite of online resources for biological information and data, including the
GenBank nucleic acid sequence database and the PubMed database. The GenBank nucleic acid
sequence database implements daily data exchange through an international collaboration with
the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), so that the
core data contained in these databases is the same. In addition to maintaining the GenBank
database, NCBI provides many other kinds of biological data as well as retrieval systems and
computational resources for the analysis of GenBank and other data. Therefore, we used the
human gene information and gene-gene interaction information provided by NCBI to construct
the human gene network.
KEGG is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic
information with higher order functional information. The KEGG DISEASE database provides
not only disease genes but also its classification of diseases based on congenital and acquired
factors as well as diseased tissues and organs. The KEGG PATHWAY database provides human
pathways representing our knowledge on the molecular interaction, reaction and relation
networks for biological interpretation of higher-level systemic functions. In our manuscript, the
genes collection of each disease is regarded as a disease module, and the pathways represent the
function modules.
2 It will make sense if the authors appropriately pointed out good examples of diseases that are
grouped together in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. We add a subsection ‘Associations and differences
between the two classifications’ in the manuscript. In this part, we give some examples of disease
pairs after discussing associations and differences, respectively. And we add a figure (Figure 7)
that is an illustration of diseases networks to help to make our results visible.
For example, in the middle of Figure 7(a), it shows that many cancers have common disease
genes, and are also classified into one group in our classification. What is more, the giant cell
tumor of bone (\#699, classified as a musculoskeletal disease in KEGG DISEASE, see
supplementary materials), is closely connected with these cancer diseases. Giant cell tumor of the
bone is a relatively uncommon tumor of the bone. Malignancy in giant cell tumor is uncommon,
however, if malignant degeneration does occur, it is likely to metastasize to the lungs[51]. So it
is reasonable to group giant cell tumor of bone with many cancers including non-small cell lung
cancer (\#19) and small cell lung cancer (\#20).
More examples are available in the subsection ‘Associations and differences between the two
classifications’.
3 Associations and differences between the two classifications should be described in more details.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. We add a subsection ‘Associations and differences
between the two classifications’ in the manuscript. And we add a figure (Figure 7) that is an
illustration of diseases networks to help to make our results visible. Here is a brief summary.
In this paper, we integrate disease genes, topological modules, and functional pathways to assess
the influence of diseases to pathways of human body. When it comes to associations between the
two classifications, the first is that both of them are based on the impact score, which is the basic
metric in this paper (More details can be obtained in 'the influence on pathways by diseases' in
Methods). The second is the criteria for classifications (More details can be obtained in
'Classification of diseases' in Methods and Figure 6). The third is that most disease pairs are
grouped together in both of the two classifications (illustrated in gray numbers in Tab.5, as the
maximum either in the row or in the column), however, many of them are not in the same group
in KEGG DISEASE database (see in Fig.7(a)).
When it comes to differences between the two classifications, the first is that they emphasize the
impact of disease on pathways from different perspectives. To classify diseases by the intensity
of effects on pathways, we use the normalized vector <U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C> <U+0001D441><U+0001D441> (<U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D458><U+0001D458> ) to measure the difference in
intensity between the pathways. The score of the most affected pathway is 1, and the score of the
least affected pathway is 0. To classify diseases by the scope of effects on pathways, we use the
binary vector <U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C> <U+0001D435><U+0001D435> (<U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D458><U+0001D458> ) to mark pathways with a score exceeding the average. The second is the
distance of diseases. In the first classification, the distance of diseases <U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D456><U+0001D456> and <U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D457><U+0001D457> is defined as
the euclidean distance of <U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C> <U+0001D441><U+0001D441> (<U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D456><U+0001D456> ) and <U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C> <U+0001D441><U+0001D441> <U+FFFD><U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D457><U+0001D457> <U+FFFD>. In the second classification, the distance of
diseases <U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D456><U+0001D456> and <U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D457><U+0001D457> is defined as the manhattan distance of <U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C> <U+0001D435><U+0001D435> (<U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D456><U+0001D456> ) and <U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C><U+0001D43C> <U+0001D435><U+0001D435> <U+FFFD><U+0001D437><U+0001D437><U+0001D457><U+0001D457> <U+FFFD>.

4 How to assess the impact of discovering new genes in the future on current results?
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. We have discussed this question in the section
‘Discussion’, as following: (6th paragraph in Discussion)
The method for deriving the results of this paper is based on the topological structure of gene
interaction network especially the largest connected component (LCC) and module division
results. After the completion of the Human Genome Project, the number of new genes discovered
in the future should be very small. However, it is unavoidable that the topological structure of
gene interaction network will be different because of the exploration of new gene-gene
interactions. We discussed this question in the ‘Discuss’ section. Here is a brief overview.
We take the published time of the literatures as the time of discovery of interactions, based on
which we obtain the LCC of the human gene network at the end of each year (from 2003 to 2017).
The number of genes in the LCC increases, however, the number of modules does not change
much (more details are available in supplementary materials). This fact may due to properties of
scale-free networks that most interactions newly discovered connect a hub gene and an isolated
gene. Although the human gene network will inevitably undergo local changes with the discovery
of new genes and gene-gene interactions, the overall organization and layout of the network will
not be changed significantly, because it is unchanged that hub nodes play a major role in the
modules.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper proposed several measures to quantify the effect of diseases on gene pathways and
functional networks and to quantify the distance between diseases and used these measures to
perform hierarchical clustering of diseases. The authors essentially performed unsupervised learning
based on gene networks based on diseases information. The authors may explain in detail how the
analysis results especially those based on the disease distance can be useful in precision medicine
(as claimed by the authors), in comparison to many developed methods in the literature for
predicting disease based on gene information, it is unclear.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. We add a figure (Figure 8) to illustrate the relationship
between our work and previous works based on gene information, and we have discussed this
question in the section ‘Discussion’, as following: (7th to 9th paragraphs in Discussion)
Disease classification is a progression towards precision medicine with the need for precise
patient characterization, currently based on clinical phenotypes but in future augmented by
laboratory-based tests[60]. As illustrated in Fig.8, researchers of hospitals and institutions obtain
molecular data of patient samples for diseases of concern. Their great studies have been providing
valuable guidance to precision medicine from many aspects, such as providing predictive,
prognostic, diagnostic, and surrogate markers of diverse disease states, informing on underlying
molecular mechanisms of diseases, allowing for classification of patients based on molecular data
etc. Our work (the blue part) is an extension on their basis, firstly, because the data we need, for
example, disease genes are identified and summarized in previous researches. Secondly, the direct
application of genetic information can be considered as first-order, while the human gene network
is an integration of genetic information, which is high-order. Thirdly, our classifications of
diseases are at a system level, designed to provide novel insights for the clinic practice at the
sample level, for example a repositioning of our understanding of diseases and exploration the
potential of combination therapy. Also, our results of diseases classifications may complement
each other with the classification of complications, as a clear definition of complications is
essential in medicine, mainly aiming to improve quality in patients' care. The lack of method for
uniform reporting of complications both in terms of definition and grading prompted the authors
to propose a classification system of complications based on combining outcome and severity of
sequelae[61]. The integration of such work will play a role in guiding combination therapy.
Moreover, the enormous complexity of common diseases and the resulting problems, such as the
fact that many patients do not respond to treatment and the increasing costs of drugs and drug
development, provide strong motivation for new and complementary strategies for research and
clinical practice[62]. The network based approaches classifying diseases based on pathways
impacted have the potential to substantially enable the elaboration of a network based view of
drug discovery and reposition (the application of known drugs to new indications), which are
challenging issues in pharmaceutical science[63,64].
Prior to clinical implementation, major challenges must be addressed from a clinician's
perspective, including understanding how network approach based genomic science is generated
and linked to patient-oriented science, which is the framework for evaluating genomic studies, as
an evidence base for providing effective precision medicine to patients in the future[65]. The
diseases studied in our work are far more than other researches, not limited to cancers or certain
diseases. This fact may lead to our results extensive, however, it may guide people to pay attention
to some unexpected points.
A comprehensive description of the associations between pathways and diseases requires
identification of not only multiple pathways associated with a specific disease but also pathways
associated with multiple diseases. In 9,125 tumors, Sanchezvega et al. point out significant
representation of individual and co-occurring actionable alterations in 10 signaling pathways[29].
Meanwhile, we find that most of the 10 signaling pathways are subject to significant influence
by diseases, including Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Notch signaling
pathway, p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle pathway, Ras signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling
pathway, Wnt signaling pathway. The current understanding of the hippo pathway, for example,
has been reviewed with an emphasis on the effects of this pathway on basic biology and human
diseases including cancers, immunity and cardiovascular diseases[66]. Another review shows that
individuals with RASopathies share many overlapping characteristics, including cardiac
malformations, short stature, neurocognitive impairment, craniofacial dysmorphy, cutaneous,
musculoskeletal, and ocular abnormalities, hypotonia and a predisposition to developing
cancer[67]. These results suggest resemblance between cancer diseases and non-cancer diseases,
and implies opportunities for targeted and combination therapies. Integrative analysis methods
have been proposed to improve power and reproducibility for identifying genes and prognosis
markers associated with multiple cancers, which may lead to discovery of novel therapeutic
targets for cancer therapies[68,69]. In addition, it estimates the effect (either positive or negative)
of the same gene in different diseases, which helps predict possible side effects of the drug.
Supported by our classification of diseases, similar applications can be implemented between
cancer diseases and non-cancer diseases to discover biomarker targets and improve drug
development for multiple diseases that are classified in the same category.
The authors should have explained the scientific motivations for defining those quantities and for
performing clustering of diseases.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. We have discussed this question in the section
‘Discussion’, as following: (3rd to 4th paragraphs in Discussion)
It is considered to be right that disease genes affect pathway functions through topology
modules[32,33]. Therefore, we derive the influence on pathways by diseases through calculating
inner product of the following two vectors. The first vector is used to measure the propagation
efficiency of specific disease signals in each of modules. Each component of the vector is the
summation of the closeness centrality of disease genes within the corresponding module.
Mathematically, the technique of network propagation is simplifying and unifying. It is a
powerful data transformation method of broad utility in genetic research, since it greatly improves
the power of genetic association, providing a universal amplifier for genetic analysis[56]. The
second vector is a measure of relevance between the module and pathways. Each component of
the vector is the jaccard similarity coefficient of the module and corresponding pathway,
indicating the extent of overlap of two large gene sets. This measure is selected mainly because
it has proven to be doing well in comparing two sets of nodes when considering the difference of
the size of the two sets[57]. Moreover, it provides an intuitive way to characterize the set similarity.
Hierarchical clustering has been the dominant approach to constructing classification schemes,
and much early work on hierarchical clustering was in the field of biological taxonomy from
1950s and more so from the 1960s onwards[58]. The dendrogram expresses many of the
proximity and classificatory relationships in a body of data. To answer the question "how many
groups are there?", we defined a parameter to measure the difference of average distances of
diseases within groups to average distances of distances between groups, playing the same role
as modularity in module partition.
