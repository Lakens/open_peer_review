Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The paper by McIntosh and Cox explores the differences in cranial biomechanics in two mole rats
that differ in their digging mode (scratch digging versus chisel tooth digging). The authors do so
by comparing the output of finite element models for both species. I think the paper is interesting
and the authors provide an original and novel ways of testing differences in the output of their
finite element models. However, I do have some comments that I'd like to see addressed:
1) there is no model validation, not even a comparison of bite forces with in vivo data or a
comparison with data on Fukomys provided by Van Daele et al. This is problematic given that
the output of the models is dependent on the input data and differs significantly (18.83 N in the
paper versus almost double that reported by Van Daele for Fukomys species based on in vivo
data and bite models). Why do the authors not even discuss or compare their data to these data?
Are their data on side only? Why these differnces?
2) even if the aim of the paper is compare two species, I would have liked to have seen a
discussion on the assumption that muscle data simply scale between species. I could for example
imagine that the muscles in Fukomys are dapted for chisel tooth digging. By consequence, the
muscles in Bathyergus could be quite different which could accentuate differences between
species. Right now the authors purely evaluate impacts of crania geometry on the stress and
strain distribution. This in itself is interesting but should probably be stated more clearly.
Moreover, I feel that the authors over interpret the differences due to geometry as being real in
vivo differences between the two animals that show a different digging mode.

This is a well written paper that addresses an interesting form-function question. Questions and
hypotheses are clearly laid out and the methods used and metrics applied are appropriate to
address the difference in performance between the chisel digging and scratch digging mole rats. I
enjoyed reading this paper and think it will be an interesting addition to the cranial biomechanics
and form-function literature. I have a few minor points that I would like the authors to address
before publication.
Methods: Adductor PCSA values were taken from the literature (Van Daele et al.). Were these
values measured from a similar sized specimen of Fukomys to the one studied here? If not, how
did you accommodate this?
Methods, line 176-177 "...making the resultant VM stress values for each model comparable." I
understand what you mean, but for the wider readership it should be stated in what context they
are comparable.
Methods, line 192. Although this is laid out in the SI, can the authors add a clarification to the text
that the 'mean' unloaded configuration represents the mean of the two unloaded Fukomys and
Bathyergus models (rather than a mean of anything else).
Results, line 204-205 ..."where joint reaction forces take place.." 'take place' isn't appropriate - use
another term - (occur?)
Discussion, line 249-259. This is contradictory, but can be rectified by rewording. In lines 251 you
state that "there is no evidence of an animal skull naturally loading to failure" but then at the end
of this paragraph state that "evolving a cranium that can function properly without failing under
its natural loading" is central to the evolution of cranial shape. The text needs rewriting to avoid
such conflicting statements and making it clear what you think might be the main (adaptive)
drivers of morphological evolution.
Figure 3 - there's a typo in the scale legend - Mpa rather than MPa.
The SI explaining the GMM approach is really useful.

Comments to the Author:
In this revised manuscript, the authors have clarified that their FEA models were not validated
with respect to biologically realistic bite forces or the specific biting and digging biomechanics of
the mole-rats under study. Considering this important limitation, it is my view that the paper
requires a much more substantial re-framing.
The title ‘Digging biomechanics in the cranium…’ and statement of the aim of the study ‘to
investigate the biomechanics of the skull during digging’ is misleading and does not accurately
portray the research approach and findings. These statements imply direct measurements of
digging behaviour, or at least recreation of biologically grounded models, and the authors did
not do this. An FEA model is an indirect theoretical analysis of a morphological structure, and the
validity of the results depend on how well the model and the analysis is validated with respect to
the real biomechanical demands of animal’s natural behaviour. Considering that the authors
have acknowledged that there is no direct validation in the current study, and that you do not
expect the models to ‘reflect biological reality’ the paper must be reframed appropriately. The
paper actually investigates how cranial morphology relates to biting mechanics and efficiency of
biting over a range of gapes, using FEA modelling. The paper must be re-written to reflect this,
without over-interpreting the aims and conclusions of the study with respect to the natural
behaviours and adaptations of the species under study. This problem arises throughout the
manuscript, from the title and abstract through the introduction and discussion. Any conclusions
about relative performance of the animals under study would require that the specific
biomechanical demands of biting and digging have been measured and used in the creation and
validation of the model, so that the model reflects biologically realistic biomechanics. The authors
cannot claim to have studied digging biomechanics or the relative performance of the two
species.
The authors make an odd statement in the introduction suggesting that FEA is an ‘all-
encompassing method’ (lines 85-90). This simply is not true. FEA modelling involves many
important assumptions and simplifications, that lead to limitations in how it can be applied and
interpreted, and this must be appropriately acknowledge by the authors both in the introduction
and the discussion.
Considering the limited biological grounding of the current model, the authors need to more
carefully frame the aims and make clear what substantive scientific advance this FEA modelling
study contributes to the literature. The general finding that ‘increasing gape decreases bite force’,
and that higher mechanical efficiency can be achieved by increasing the moment arms around a
joint seems to be a conclusion that could be drawn from a much more simple biomechanical
analysis of morphology and muscle lever arms, without a complex FEA simulation.

review process. The link provided under ‘data accessibility’ is not active. The authors should
provide the data as a supplementary file, or submit it to DataDryad.org as a submission in review

I have not reviewed the first version of the manuscript but in my opinion the authors have
reacted to the comments and suggestions of the reviewers accordingly and have amended the
manuscript.
I have two small remarks:
The correct spelling of the scientific species name of the giant mole-rat is Fukomys mechowii
(two i at the end); cf. Kock D., Ingram C. M., Frabotta L. J., Burda H., Honeycutt R. L. (2006): On
the nomenclature of Bathyergidae and Fukomys n. g. (Mammalia: Rodentia). Zootaxa 1142: 51-55.
There are not so many relevant papers dealing with the skull morphology of the bathyergid
mole-rats. One of those few is, however, the paper by Barciova et al. (2009), discussing the effect
of habitat (soil) upon skull morphology: Barciova L., Sumbera R., Burda H. (2009): Variation in
the digging apparatus of the subterranean silvery mole-rat, Heliophobius argenteocinereus

Thank you for making the supporting data available. The reviewer makes one final suggestion
that the authors consider adding a "read me.txt" file to the supporting data that clearly explains
the columns of each of the uploaded txt files. As this comment does not influence the main
manuscript, we are pleased to be able to accept the manuscript in its current form.

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Authors
Thank you for making the files available. The link to the data is now working and I am happy
with the models. My only suggestion is that you add a "read me.txt" file that clearly explains
what the columns of each of the uploaded txt files refers to. I am an experienced FEA user and I
understand the data but I am concerned that a new user may have difficulties understanding
what the numbers in the columns refer to.
Please note that this is just a suggestion. I am very happy for the paper to get published as is.
Thank you for the great work.
Digging biomechanics in the cranium of African mole-rats (Rodentia: Bathyergidae)
Response to reviewer comments
We thank both reviewers for their useful and helpful comments on our manuscript. We note that
the comments were in general very positive, so we hope that by addressing them, both in the body
of the manuscript and in the response below, that the manuscript will now be acceptable for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Associate Editor
The models have not been validated in this study, because we do not expect them to reflect
biological reality. Rather we are interested in the relative response of the cranium to changing
muscle orientations in each species. We have added a paragraph explicitly stating this to the end of
the materials and methods (lines 208-212).
Reviewer 1
1. As the reviewer notes, the manuscript as it stands does not include any validation or
comparison with in vivo data. However, it was never our intention to produce biologically
accurate models, rather we wished to understand the effects of changing gape angle on
comparable FE models. Thus, it was more important to keep input parameters the same
between models than to replicate in vivo conditions. The reviewer correctly notes that the
bite force predicted in our Fukomys model does not match that measured by Van Daele et
al. However, although we used muscle force data from Van Daele et al (2009), the specimens
were different, so there was no expectation that the bite forces would match. On reflection,
reporting absolute force was unnecessary and confusing for the reader and not the intention
of the study – bite forces were never discussed in the text, only reported in Table 2. Thus,
we have decided to remove absolute bite force from Table 2, leaving mechanical efficiency.
This is made clear in text added to the materials and methods (lines 187-192).
2. The reviewer is correct to question that the muscles simply scale between species. We do
not expect that this is the case at all. Rather, the scaling of the muscle forces is a technique,
outlined by Dumont et al (2009), for enabling direct comparisons of stresses between FE
models of different sizes. Thus our study is concerned solely with cranial shape. We
acknowledge this in an addition to the first paragraph of the discussion (lines 266-272).
Furthermore, we think the final paragraph as it stands makes very clear our focus on cranial
morphology rather than other factors, with repeated mentions of morphology, form and
shape.
Line 54: ‘distinctions’ in changed to ‘differences of’
Line 61: ‘soils’ changed to ‘soil’
Line 134: Unfortunately, we are not aware of any research into material properties of bone in
animals that have high skull loading. The reviewers point about potential differences in Young’s
modulus between the two crania has been noted at the end of the first paragraph of the discussion
(lines 270-272).
Lines 145-6: sentence reworded as suggested
Lines 225, 234-5: Although 90 degrees is an unrealistic bite for Bathyergus, it may well be realistic for
Fukomys. Thus we felt it important to replicate a 90 degree bite on both skulls to facilitate a full
comparison. It is also a useful result that confirms that a 90 degrees gape would be unachievable by
Bathyergus.
Line 233: ‘the’ added
Line 243: It wasn’t entirely clear what the reviewer was alluding to here, but we have added a
phrase into the discussion section (line 275) that makes it clear that we have used the scaling
technique of Dumont et al (2009) and are simply considering model geometry.
Line 251: We thank the reviewer for this point, which may well be of use in later studies.
Line 303: We prefer to keep the final paragraph as one, as it functions as the conclusion to the study.
Reviewer 2
We thank reviewer 2 for their positive comments.
Methods: Yes, the PCSA values were from a generally similar-sized specimen, but we were not too
concerned with biological accuracy (see response to reviewer 1 and editor).
Methods: New sentence inserted at lines 176-178 to further explain how the scaling enabled
comparisons of VM stress
Methods: Sentence updated to clarify that mean model is the mean of the two unloaded Fukomys
and Bathyergus models.
Results: ‘take place’ replaced by ‘occur’ as suggested
Discussion: We agree with the reviewer that this was contradictory and not entirely reflective of the
article under discussion. Sentence now changed to “evolving a cranium that can generate the
highest possible bite force relative to muscle force”.

Reviewer 1
I appreciate the time and effort the authors have put into revising the manuscript. I think this is a
wonderful study and I understand that due to lack of validation and all modelling assumptions
caution is given in the interpretation of the results. However, I believe that the results could have
been discussed in a clearer manner. I thus ask the authors to revise the discussion session and focus
it around the hypotheses and aims tested without over or under interpreting their findings.
The introduction reads well but at the end it needs a paragraph that clarifies the limitations of the
study. I think it is important for the readers to see that the authors are aware of all methodological
limitations prior to the discussion session.
The M & M session lacks information on the types of deformations. You have used von Mises
stresses but I would have liked to see the distributions and orientations of the maximum and
minimum principal stresses too.
I noticed that there is no link to access all supporting data/models. I think it would have been nice
for all raw data to be made available to the reviewers during the review process.
ABSTRACT
The authors in their responses to the previous reviewers’ comments noted that the models have not
been validated because they do not intend to produce biologically accurate models, but to
understand the effects of changing gape angle on comparable FE models between Btahyergus and
Fukomys. Due to these limitations I believe it is not correct to make assumptions about the
adaptation of Fukomys to activities requiring high bite forces. I ask the authors to tone down Lines
39-41 since this statement over interprets the findings.
INTRODUCTION
Lines 52-53: Please rewrite this sentence in a clearer manner.
Line 54: Replace “of” with “in”.
Line 61: Start a new paragraph after “construction”.
Line 95: Please replace “the biomechanics of the skull” with “stress distributions of the skull”.
Line 99: Replace “biomechanical response” with “stress patterns”
Line 99: Replace “Using a novel technique of integrating geometric morphometrics with FEA” with
“Integrating GMM with FEA”. This combination of techniques has been used previously.
Lines 101-102 are unclear. Please rephrase.
Lines 103-105: I am concerned that due to the limitations of the study point 2 cannot be tested. Also
what is the difference between points 1 and 3? I would have also liked to see a clearer rationale of
the hypotheses.
Lines 104-106 are unclear. Please be more specific.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lines 120-122: Please remove these lines. The study referenced here was conducted on a completely
different species. The authors assumed homogeneity and modelled the bone as cortical bone due to
lack of more accurate data and this assumption stands in comparative studies using FEA as long as
such limitations are taken into consideration.
Remove Lines 134-135.
Line 138: Be specific. What do you mean with “the direction of the bite”?
Line 138-139. The model seems over fixed in the TMJ. Have you done any sensitivity analysis using
fewer constraints to see whether this will influence bending and the overall results? Comparisons
would not change the direct comparisons but could influence the overall bending behaviour of the
skull.
Also what are you comparing in terms of stresses? Are you focused on magnitudes, patterns,
orientations?
RESULTS
Lines 215-216: Please be specific. What do you mean by “differ slightly between the two crania?”
I ask the authors to be more specific in the presentation of the results rather than discussing about
more or less stressed areas. I would also like to see orientations here and some figures showing
principal stresses.
Line 221-222: Please remove “probably..Bathyergus”. This is interpretation and not actual results.
Remove this line to the discussion.
Lines 22-223: It is not clear what the authors imply here. In FEA you always expect high stresses
around the constraints and muscle attachments. The difference you get here is due to the
differences in magnitude in the muscle magnitude between the two models.
DISCUSSION
I think the discussion session needs reorganisation.
We thank the editor and reviewer for their extensive review on the second iteration of this manuscript.
We are particularly grateful for the reviewer’s description of the study as “wonderful”. It is clear to us
now that the language used in writing this paper was not precise enough and tended to draw much
wider conclusions that were justified by the results. It will be seen from the large passages of red text,
particularly in the introduction and discussion, that we have extensively rewritten the manuscript to
address this issue. We feel that this is now a much clearer and more focused manuscript and hope it is
now suitable for inclusion in Royal Society Open Science. Our responses to specific comments from the
editor and reviewer are dealt with one by one below.
Editor comments
The title has been changed to a much more specific statement which we think reflects more accurately
the content of the paper.
Throughout the paper, we have removed sentences and phrases that implied that the research revealed
anything about digging biomechanics as a whole, and instead have restricted ourselves to conclusions
regarding the impact of cranial morphology under the specific loading conditions modelled here. The
limitations of what can and can’t be concluded from the results is explicitly discussed in lines 259-264
and lines 337-341.
The statement that FEA is an “all-encompassing method” has been removed and indeed that whole
paragraph has been rewritten (lines 70-85). The end of the paragraph now includes a statement of what
FEA, as a modelling technique, can and can’t do, with reference to previous validation work.
The statement that “increasing gape decreases bite force” was never meant to be a major finding. It was
simply a passing observation, before moving on to less trivial results. However, on reflection, the
paragraph was written badly, and emphasised this outcome far too much. The more interesting result is
that Fukomys is able to maintain its mechanical efficiency to a greater degree at wide gapes than is
Bathyergus. This section has been rewritten (lines 274-280).
Reviewer comments
It was original intention that the discussion section was focused around the hypotheses, but this must
not have been clear enough to the reader. So, we have now given subheadings to the discussion to
make this clear.
The limitations of FEA are discussed in the second paragraph of the introduction (lines 70-85) and we
have also added two sentences to the end of the introduction stating the focus and limitations of this
study (lines 102-106).
The reviewer appears to be mixing up stress and deformation here. We have used von Mises stresses to
give an idea of the relative likelihood of structural failure – this is a very common approach in FE
studies. We don’t agree that examining maximum and minimum principal stresses would provide much
more information here. The way in which the models are deforming is shown by the GMM analysis – we
think this is much clearer method of understanding of how the cranium is reacting to load. Furthermore,
we have based our manuscript on a classic FE study – Dumont et al, 2011 (J Anat 218: 151-162) – and
used three similar performance measures to them (VM stress, mechanical efficiency of biting,
deformation).
There is indeed a link to access the supporting data and models under ‘Data Accessibility’ at the end of
the manuscript just before the references.
ABSTRACT
The abstract has been rewritten, particularly the lines highlighted by the reviewer.
INTRODUCTION
Lines 52-52: The opening paragraph has been rewritten
Lines 54: The opening paragraph has been rewritten
Line 61: New paragraph started
Line 95: Line rewritten, ‘biomechanics’ replaced with ‘performance’
Line 99: Suggested replacement made
Line 99: Suggested replacement made
Lines 101-12: Sentence rewritten
Lines 103-105: Again, there seems to be some confusion between stress and deformation. Von Mises
stress (point 1) is a measure of resistance to structural failure, whereas deformation (point 3) is a
measure of how much the shape of the model changes under loading. Mechanical efficiency of biting
(point 2) is used here because it can be tested and compared between the models unlike bite force. It is
a ratio of the output bite force to input muscle force and thus shows how efficient a particular cranial
shape is at converting muscle force to bite force. Further text has been added here to clarify the
rationale behind the hypotheses, and to make it very clear that we are following Dumont et al, 2011, in
the parameters that we have chosen to measure and analyse.
Lines 104-106: Hypotheses rewritten to be clearer
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lines 120-122: Lines removed
Lines 134-135: Lines removed
Line 138: Further explanation of incisor constraint added (‘orthogonal to occlusal plane)
Lines 138-139: Actually, on models of this size (> 5 million elements), 40 constrained nodes at each
TMJ is a very small area to constrain. However, to be certain, we have re-run our models with 20 and 10
constrained nodes at each TMJ. No difference was found in the VM stress patterns, median VM stress or
GMM deformation analysis (or in the bite forces, but that was to be expected anyway).
Von Mises stress magnitudes and patterns are presented.
RESULTS
Lines 215-216: Further explanation of “differ slightly between the two crania” was given in the
subsequent sentences. However, this paragraph has now been rewritten. It is standard practice in FE
studies to describe which areas of the model are experiencing the highest levels of stress. Because Von
Mises stress is a measure of resistance to failure, it does not have an orientation, but it is appropriate to
discuss where it high and where it is low. As mentioned above, we haven’t included principal stresses,
preferring to cranial deformations.
Lines 221-222: Phrase removed
Lines 222-223: Paragraph rewritten
DISCUSSION
As mentioned above, subheadings added to discussion to clarify the structure in relation to the
hypotheses.
Responses to reviewers
We thank the reviewers for their positive comments on the manuscript. We have addressed the
outstanding issues as follows:
1. The spelling of the species name of Fukomys mechowii has now been corrected throughout
the manuscript.
2. The Barciova et al paper on the relationship between soil type and cranial morphology has
now been discussed and cited in both the introduction (line 70) and conclusions (line 335).
3. Apologies for giving the wrong Figshare link – I’m still getting to grips with the site. The
correct link has been added to the manuscript and is
