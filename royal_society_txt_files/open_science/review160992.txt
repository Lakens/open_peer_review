Fontaine et al. present a very well written and thorough study of population structure of harbor
porpoises around the UK, and within the context of ecotype differentiation in the North Atlantic.
They have used standard genetic methods (microsatellite genotyping, 9 loci) with dense sampling
through a hybrid zone, applying multiple analytical techniques to demonstrate the strength,
pattern, and potential mechanisms for isolation by distance through the hybrid zone. The genetic
results are put into context of the biogeographic history of the species in the North Atlantic,
ecological variables, and implications for the further analysis of the genetics of body size
differences and the potential effects of climate change. Overall this is a very nicely presented
study and I have only a few, minor suggestions for modifications prior to acceptance for
publication.
Details (page No., line No.)
Throughout the text, tables and figures, the subscripts and superscripts are too small to read.
3, 23: it becomes obvious later that sex was also determined for most specimens, but it would be
helpful to indicate that in the methods where other data types are listed.
3, 54-55: contents of the PCR reactions should all be given as final concentrations, not volumes
(e.g., 1x PCR buffer, XX units Amplitaq). Also, the text indicates 0.1mM of each nucleotide, but
then says dCTP was at 0.01 mM. Since one is different, it should indicate that dT, G, ATP were at
0.1mM.
4, 22 and 33: In both of these lines, does R refer to Ra? Only Ra is defined.
4, 40: I don’t believe it is necessary to apply a Bonferroni correction to pairwise Fst comparisons.
Each test is independent of the others, and testing a different hypothesis (differentiation between
the specified strata). Bonferroni should only be applied if multiple tests are for a common null
hypothesis such that all would be rejected if any were significant. However, using the Bonferroni
correction is conservative and does not change the conclusions of the paper.
7, 16: change “any” to “either”
7, 20: insert “of” before “this admixture zone.”
7, 27-38: The sPCA analysis provides another way to “picture” fine scale genetic structure. This
paragraph describes the data, but does not explain what additional information is added by this
analysis that is not already apparent from the structure analysis? Is it that it allows spatially
explicit visualization of the individual PC scores?
8, 33: insert “as” before “body size.”
8, 43: delete “as previously” after “same cohort”.
Table 1: The totals in the bottom line are not the sum of the number of samples in the individual
categories. The legend should explain that the totals include the samples that could not be
assigned to one of the 3 age-sex classes. Also, the numbers in this table are different from some of
the numbers on the maps in ESM figures S1 and S2. These represent the same data and should be
reconciled.
3
Figure 1b needs a legend and needs to be large enough to clearly see the colors (similar to ESM
figure S7). This will be very useful for the reader to see where the regions are, as there is not other
map in the main text that shows where each of the 6 regions are and what samples are in those
regions.
Figure 2a: The label for Cwest here is abbreviated as UK SW. It should be changed to Cwest for
consistency. The number of samples should also be indicated in the legend, as it’s not clear from
the text how many samples in total were used in this analysis. The text “post-processed using
CLUMPAK [37]” can be deleted, as this is described in the methods.

The MS from M Fontaine et al describes an interesting genetic characterization of the harbour
porpoise along the costs of the UK, including a comparison at a larger geographical scale thanks
to results previously obtained.
Large shifts of the harbour porpoise distribution in the North East Atlantic waters have been
demonstrated in the last decades by field observations (in particular the SCANS 1 and II
campaigns) and geographically targeted stranding monitorings.
Along the French Atlantic coasts in particular, harbour porpoises were scarce 3-4 decades ago,
before becoming again one the most common cetacean. Two populations of harbour porpoises,
separated by the Bay of Biscay, have been highlighted by Fontaine et al (2007). Since that, and
taking into account genetic data as well as field observations, the existence of a recent admixing
4
zone between the 2 populations along the French Atlantic coast of France has been proved by
others (not cited in the Fontaine et al. MS). The samples used in the Fontaine et al. MS come from
the north of this admixing zone, whose northern limits were previously not known.
The study from Fontaine et al is therefore highly interesting, and its results are significant,
because (1) it takes place in a larger European geographic context (see for instance Fontaine et al
2007, 2008, 2014 ; Alfonsi et al. 2012, Wiemann et al 2010, Sveegaard et al 2015), and (2) because it
extends the previous study of Alfonsi et al on the admixing area along the Bay of Biscay and the
North West Atlantic French coasts. The study uses a very large number of samples, the
experimental procedures and the data analysis are adequate (although I have some minor
remarks on the MM part), the MS is well written, and I therefore think that this study deserves to
be published.
However, in my opinion, different major points should be addressed before the MS can be
published.
- the genetic characterization of the harbour porpoise in the UK waters must certainly take into
account the present knowledge of the harbour porpoise distribution in the UK waters and along
the French Atlantic coasts (as the admixing zone originates from here). The significance of the
results could certainly be improved if the genetic characterization can be incorporated in a
boarder context including distribution variations. For instance, the introduction could include a
description of the variations of the harbour porpoise distribution in the 3-4 last decades around
the UK and in neighboring regions, including the relevant citations, and the discussion could
consider these data to explain the genetic results observed.
- The Iberian population has been clearly distinguished by others using mtDNA polymorphisms.
The study of M Fontaine et al. would strongly benefit of including mtDNA data as well. If such
data are available, they could be valuably included in the MS, and help to decipher the genetic
structure of the sampling.
- Some major publications about harbour porpoise genetic characterization and distribution in the
studied area are not cited. In particular, the publication highlighting the existence of the harbour
porpoise admixture zone along the French Atlantic waters, close to the SW of the UK. The list of
reference should therefore be improved and the text of the MS could cite the results of the
previous studies and discus them. They seem to be in perfect adequacy with the results of the
present MS, and will therefore reinforce it.
- One quality of the MS is to include morphological data as well as genetic analysis. Would it be
possible to highlight more this part of the study, which strongly supports the existence of the 2
populations and of the admixing area, and opens news and highly interesting studies ("...suggests
a potential genetic basis to traits with adaptive significance such body size")
- In this MS, the UK coasts are divided into 6 regions. The abbreviation for these regions are not
homogeneous among regions, and not easy to remember when reading the MS. It would be
relevant (1) to explain how these 6 regions were defined and (2) name them with simpler
(explicit) names
- the Fig 5 is interesting, but, in my opinion, it is not sufficiently explained, described and used in
the discussion (see previous remark about the morphological data). It could be removed.
- The abstract is really confusing, and could be rephrased (for instance, the words southern and
northern ecotypes are used but not defined, and can not be understood without reading the MS)
Some minor points.

This is a well-designed and important study which will be of interest to those study harbor
porpoise elsewhere. However, the referees have identified a number of issues that must be
addressed before it can be published; in particular, Referee 2 provides some very useful concrete
suggestions for incorporation of the results of other studies into the overall context of this work. I
agree with the referee that this will significantly improve the paper's value.

Dear Authors,
I think that this new version of the manuscript has been strongly improved, and I would like to
acknowledge the work that has been done by the authors.
I just have one point to mention, about the author's R14 response. Numbers of harbour porpoises,
stranded and observed, increased significantly since 1990 along the French Atlantic coast and the
Channel. See for instance, among others, Peltier et al. Plos One, 2013; Pikesley et al. JMBA 2011
who all evidenced this increase of Harbour porpoise presence. The study of Pikesley et al. in
particular focuses on the south west of the UK
The samples used here have all been collected between 1990-2000, this is exactly the period of
increased Harbour porpoise presence in the area studied. The admixing zone evidenced in this
MS in the CWest may well be correlated to this shift of harbour porpoise presence.
So I still think that this is an important parameter, that could be discussed. As clearly explained
by the conclusion of the MS, future genetic studies taking into account chronological variations,
and therefore shifts of harbour porpoise distribution, will certainly lead to new understandings.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The authors have done a great job addressing the highly relevant and detailed comments of the
referees, and I hope that the reviews and the authors' responses will be publicly available for
those who would like to see the additional detail.
The referee on this round raises a good point with regard to a possible explanation for the
admixture result, as well as a recommendation that shifting distribution be accounted for as a
factor in future studies. With that inclusion, this paper is ready for publication.

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Authors,
I think that this new version of the manuscript has been strongly improved, and I would like to
acknowledge the work that has been done by the authors.
15
I just have one point to mention, about the author's R14 response. Numbers of harbour porpoises,
stranded and observed, increased significantly since 1990 along the French Atlantic coast and the
Channel. See for instance, among others, Peltier et al. Plos One, 2013; Pikesley et al. JMBA 2011
who all evidenced this increase of Harbour porpoise presence. The study of Pikesley et al. in
particular focuses on the south west of the UK
The samples used here have all been collected between 1990-2000, this is exactly the period of
increased Harbour porpoise presence in the area studied. The admixing zone evidenced in this
MS in the CWest may well be correlated to this shift of harbour porpoise presence.
So I still think that this is an important parameter, that could be discussed. As clearly explained
by the conclusion of the MS, future genetic studies taking into account chronological variations,
and therefore shifts of harbour porpoise distribution, will certainly lead to new understandings.

1. Summary
39
40
41 Contact zones between ecotypes are windows for understanding how species may react to climate changes.
42 We analysed the fine scale genetic and morphological variation in harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena)
43
44 around the UK by genotyping 591 stranded animals at 9 microsatellite loci. The data were integrated with a
45 prior study to map at high resolution the contact zone between ecotypes in the northern Bay of Biscay.
46
47 Clustering and spatial analyses revealed that UK porpoises are derived from two genetic pools with porpoises
48 from the southwestern UK being genetically differentiated, and having larger body-sizes compared to other
49
UK areas. Southwestern UK porpoises are admixed between southern and northern ecotypes with a contact
50
51 zone extending from the northern Bay of Biscay to the Celtic Sea and Channel. Around the UK ancestry blends
52 from one genetic group to the other along a SW-NE axis, correlating with body size variation, consistent with
53
54 morphological differences between the two ecotypes. We also detected isolation-by-distance only among
55 juveniles but not in adults, suggesting that stranded juveniles display reduced intergenerational dispersal. The
56
fine scale structure of this admixture zone raises the question of how it will respond to future climate change
57
58 and provides a reference point for further study.

4 2. Introduction
5
6 Intraspecific differentiation in contiguous geographical areas due to vicariance or environmental barriers is
7
8 common in nature [1]. However, in the marine environment, movements are typically unrestricted over vast
9 distances for highly mobile species such as cetaceans. This raises the question of how populations become
10 genetically and ecologically differentiated with eventual speciation [2]. Despite their high dispersal ability,
11
12 some cetaceans show substantial population structure, sometimes over a small geographical scale, not
13 necessarily associated with geographic distance [2-4]. In some cases, oceanographic processes and (or)
14
15 behavioural traits explain a high level of population differentiation [4-9]. Prey availability, prey choice, social
16 structure and/or other factors such as habitat availability, predator and competition pressure can all be
17
involved in driving the pattern and extent of dispersal [3]. Explaining dispersal thus revolves around
18
19 deciphering which current and/or historical mechanism(s) contributed to genetic structuring in the absence of
20 obvious dispersal barriers.
21
22
23 The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is one of the smallest and most abundant coastal cetaceans, widely
24
distributed in sub-polar to temperate coastal waters of the northern hemisphere [10]. Numerous studies
25
26 assessed the population genetic structure of harbour porpoises in the Western Palearctic waters (i.e. the
27 eastern North Atlantic and Black Sea) during the last 20 years [4,11-15]. However, only recently have three
28
29 ecotypes or subspecies been identified in Western Palearctic waters, based on genetic divergence of the
30 mitochondrial genome, supported by morphological, and ecological differences [13]. These three ecotypes
31
32 include an isolated population in the Black Sea (P. p. relicta), the southern ecotypes (P. p. meridionnalis)
33 displaying larger body-size [16], with two distinct populations inhabiting upwelling waters around
34
Mauritania and the Iberian peninsula, and a northern ecotype (P. p. phocoena) inhabiting the continental shelf
35
36 from the north side of the Bay of Biscay to the subarctic waters of Norway and Iceland.
37
38
39 Fontaine et al. [13] showed that these 3 ecotypes resulted from an initial split between the North Atlantic and
40 Mediterranean porpoises, with the colonization of the Mediterranean Sea during the last Ice Age. This event
41
was followed by a split of the Mediterranean population into Eastern and Western groups from which
42
43 descended the Black Sea population on one side [17] and the Iberian and Mauritanian populations on the
44 other side. Finally, the Iberian population came back into contact with the northern continental shelf ecotype
45
46 during the last millennium, and most likely during the Little Ice age (ca. 600 years ago), establishing a contact
47 zone on the northern side of the Bay of Biscay, with predominantly northward gene flow [13,18]. However,
48
49 the fine scale spatial genetic structure of this admixture zone and the limits of its spatial distribution are still
50 poorly understood. Previous studies had restricted sampling on the northern side of the Bay of Biscay, and in
51 particular there has been limited coverage of porpoises from around the United Kingdom (UK).
52
53
54 In this study, we analysed the genetic structure of harbour porpoises around UK using a dense sampling of
55
56 591 stranded animals (figure 1 and electronic supplementary material (ESM), figure S1-S3) spanning a decade
57 from 1990 to 2002 (ESM, figure S4). We placed this “local” genetic assessment within the global genetic
58
structure of the of harbour porpoises in the NE Atlantic by combining the UK dataset with previous data from
59
60 Fontaine et al. [4]. We tested whether animals stranded around UK show any evidence of mixed genetic
ancestry from distinct genetic pools and morphological differentiation in terms of relative body-size. Given

4 the proximity of the Biscay admixture zone [4,13,18], porpoises in the SW part of UK might be expected to
5
6 show evidence of such mixed ancestry and could have larger body sizes, closer to Iberian porpoises. We also
7 showed previously that gene flow and individual dispersal was restricted in space on the continental shelf
8
north of the Bay of Biscay [4], creating a pattern of Isolation-by-distance (IBD) [19,20]. Here, we tested whether
9
10 such IBD exists around UK and whether it differed between age classes. Understanding the physical and
11 ecological factors which influence the distribution of different ecotypes is central to understanding how this
12
13 key pelagic predator may react to future climate change, and its subsequent impacts on North East Atlantic
14 ecosystem [21].

21 Sampling
22
Tissue samples collected between 1990 and 2002, body size, weight, age and associated temporal, geographical
23
24 and life-history data for 591 stranded or by-caught porpoises from the United Kingdom Cetacean Strandings
25 Project (http://ukstrandings.org/) archives were provided by P. Jepson (Institute of Zoology, Zoological
26
27 Society of London) and R. Reid (Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, SRUC Veterinary Services,
28 Inverness). The distribution of the sampling in space, time and per categories is shown in figure 1, table 1, and
29
30 ESM figure S1 to S4. All maps in this study were generated in R statistical environment v.3.2.4 [22] using
31 MARMAP v0.9.5 package [23] and the ETOPO1 dataset available on the US National Geophysical Data Centre
32 (NGDC) [24].
33
34
35 Environmental data
36
37 Data on habitat characteristics across the study range with respect to salinity and sea surface temperature
38 were taken from the National Oceanographic Data Centre (NODC) World Ocean Atlas (WOA01) [25].
39
Bathymetric data were extracted from the ETOPO2 dataset (NGDC) [24] and data on surface chlorophyll
40
41 concentration were taken from the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor database (SeaWIFS) [26]. To
42 compare local habitat characteristics where harbour porpoise were living before dying, we calculated the
43
44 mean value (± SD) of each variables within a radius arbitrarily set at 50km around each sampling locality
45 using the Spatial Analyst extension in ArcGIS™ 8.2 (ESRI®).

47
48 DNA extraction and microsatellite genotyping
49 Genomic DNA was extracted from skin or muscle sample using a standard phenol-chloroform protocol.
50
51 Individuals were screened at 10 microsatellite loci used previously in harbour porpoises (Igf-1, 417/418,
52 415/416, GT011, GT136, GT015, EV94, EV104, GATA053, TAA031) [11]. PCR reactions were carried out in 10
53
54 µl volumes overlaid with 10 µl of mineral oil using 1µl of template DNA (approximately 10-50 ng/µl); 1 µl 10x
55 PCR buffer with 1.5 mM MgCl (or 2.5 mM for loci GT015 and GT011, 2 mM for locus Igf-1), 45 nl Amplitaq

56
57 DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer), 0.8 mM of each primer, 0.1 mM of each nucleotide and 0.01 mM dCTP. PCR
58 products were labeled by direct incorporation of <1µCi P-dCTP. The PCR cycle regime for EV104, EV96 and
32
59
EV94 was: 1x (95°C for 3 minute); 7x (93°C for 1 minutes, 48°C for 1 minute, 72°C for 50 seconds); 25x (90°C
60
for 45 seconds, second annealing temperature for 1 minute, 73°C for 1 minute); final stage (72°C for 15
minutes). For all other loci: 1x (3 minutes at 95°C); 35x (94°C for 1 minute, annealing temperature for 30

13 Data analysis.
14
15
16 Genetic diversity and differentiation around UK. We estimated the proportion of missing data per locus and
17
region using poppr packages [27] for the R statistical environment v.3.2.4 [22]. Observed and expected
18
19 heterozygosity (H , H ), allelic richness (Ra), and inbreeding coefficient (F ) [28] were calculated using
o e IS
20 GENETIX v.4.05 [29] and FSTAT v.2.9.3 [30]. These statistics were calculated per region (figure 1a). Per region
21
22 R was computed based on a rarefaction procedure using the minimum sample size available across regions
a
23 around UK (n=13). We conducted permutation tests (10 permutations) in FSTAT to assess potential
5
24
25 departures from Hardy–Weinberg (HW) equilibrium for each population. Confidence interval at 95% for the
26 F values were calculated using the diveRsity v.1.9.89 [31] package for R [22].
IS
27
28
29 We also investigated local patterns of genetic diversity by calculating Ra on a grid lattice of 2° where cells
30 included at least two samples. We used a custom R-script to prepare the data, and ADZE 1.0 [32] to calculate
31
32 Ra based on a standardized minimum sample size of 2 individuals. We plotted on a map an interpolated
33 surface of R calculated using an inverse distance weighted procedure using gstat package for R [33].
a
34
35
36 Levels of differentiation in allelic frequencies between regional groups of porpoises was estimated using
37 pairwise F [28] values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using the diveRsity [31] package for R. We
ST
38
39 considered F comparisons as significant only if two conditions were met: the lower CI is >0, and P-values are
ST
40 <0.05 following a Bonferroni correction.
41
42
43 Bayesian genetic clustering analyses. We analysed the genetic structure using a Bayesian model-based
44 clustering method implemented in Structure v.2.3.4 [34-36]. Since Isolation-by-Distance (IBD) has been
45
46 previously observed north of the Bay of Biscay [4], we accounted for this by introducing into the Bayesian
47 analysis a prior assumption that individuals found in the same area are likely to be more closely related to
48
49 each other than individuals sampled from more distant locations. To implement this, we used the sampling
50 location as a prior information in the Bayesian inference using the Locprior admixture model [36]. This model
51
has better performance to detect existing genetic structure when the level of divergence is weak, yet without
52
53 introducing biases towards detecting structure when it is not present [36]. Furthermore, we showed
54 previously that this model provides a significant improvement to recover fine-scale genetic structure for the
55
56 porpoises in the NE Atlantic by reducing the noise around estimates of individual admixture proportions [13].
57 Structure analyses were conducted by running a series of independent simulations with different numbers of
58
simulated clusters (K), testing all values from 1 to 5. Each run used an admixture model with correlated allele
59
60 frequencies, 1 x 10 iterations after a burn-in of 1 x 10 iterations. Ten replicates of each run were conducted to
6 5
test for convergence of the MCMCs. Results were post-processed using CLUMPAK [37] and custom R-scripts

We conducted this analysis at a local scale along the UK coasts, considering 6 zones which correspond to the
9
10 main maritime areas around the UK (figure 1B): the Channel, the Celtic Sea on the South West coast (CWest),
11 the North Sea North (NSN), the North Sea South (NSS), the West coast (West), and West coast of Scotland
12
13 (WScot). In addition, to put the local genetic structure into a broader context in the NE Atlantic, we combined
14 the UK dataset with data previously obtained from Fontaine et al. [4,13]. The two data sets include
15
respectively 9 and 10 microsatellite loci with an overlap for 6 loci and a sample size of 591 new individuals
16
17 from the UK coastlines and 676 from the other regions in the NE Atlantic [4,13] (figure 1, ESM figure S5). To
18 calibrate allele sizes between the two studies, we genotyped 10 samples from UK and 10 from Fontaine et al.
19
20 [4,13] with the same protocol as described in [4,39] and aligned allele sizes between the data sets. We also ran
21 the structure analysis on this enlarged dataset considering 25 sampled locations (figure 2), including the 6
22
zones along the UK coasts (Figure 1b) and the 19 zones previously used in Fontaine et al. [4,13]
23
24
25 Non-parametric multivariate analyses. Multivariate analyses of genetic data can provide a complementary
26
27 view to model-based Bayesian clustering approach [40,41]. We further analysed the genetic structure at the
28 local scale around UK using a spatial Principal Component Analyses (sPCA) [42], accounting for spatial
29
30 autocorrelation, and aiming at displaying genetic variance with a spatial structure. We used a ‘global’ and
31 ‘local’ test procedures based on Monte Carlo permutations (10 permutations) to interpret the significance of
4
32
the spatial principal components in the sPCA [42]. Following the definition of the sPCA, ‘global structure’
33
34 relates to patterns of spatial genetic structure, such as patches, clines, isolation by distance and intermediates,
35 whereas ‘local structure’ refers to strong differences between local neighbourhoods [42]. These analyses were
36
37 conducted using adegenet 1.4-2 package [43] for the R software [22].
38
39
Isolation by distance analysis. Patterns of isolation by distance (IBD) may emerge if dispersal is spatially
40
41 restricted at the scale of our study [19]. Under the hypothesis of IBD, genetic differentiation between
42 individuals (estimated using the â statistics analogous to F /(1-F ) between demes) is expected to increase
r ST ST
43
44 with increasing geographic distance [20,44,45]. We calculated the regression coefficient (b) between genetic
45 and geographic distance matrices between individuals and evaluated its significance with a Mantel Test (10 4
46
47 permutations of geographic locations) using SpaGeDi 1.4 [46]. Instead of using an Euclidian distance that
48 would poorly describe the actual geographic distance between pairs of individuals, we computed a marine
49
geographic distances that accounts for the shortest path by sea between two individuals as described in
50
51 Fontaine et al. [4]. To compute this marine geographic distance, we used a Least Cost Path algorithm using a
52 modified version of PATHMATRIX [47], implemented in C for improved computational efficiency (available
53
54 upon request to Dr. N. Ray).
55
56
We tested the occurrence of IBD first on all individuals around UK. Then we tested whether IBD patterns
57
58 differed among sex and age classes. While IBD patterns should be similar among sexes, since we are using
59 autosomal loci, IBD patterns can potentially differ among age classes if one of the classes (e.g., the juveniles)
60
disperses less than another classes (e.g. the adults). We tested IBD in adults versus juveniles only, as sample

9 individuals (n=336) included in the genetic analyses. As two porpoise ecotypes are present in the study area
10
and are known to differ according to their body size [16], we investigated how body-length varied as a
11
12 function of the animal age and sex using a linear model. We were interested in the residual variation not
13 accounted for by the age and sex and in particular its geographic component. Residual variation in body
14
15 length was compared among the 6 UK geographic zones with an ANOVA in R [22] using log-transformation
16 for body-length and age. We also assessed the correlation between individual residual body size and
17
individual admixture score derived from the Structure analysis.

26 Genetic diversity and differentiation between regions around UK
27 The proportion of missing data observed at the 10 microsatellite loci for the UK individuals ranged between
28
29 0.5% and 4.9% (ESM figure S5). All loci but EV104 showed less than 10% missing data in any of the 6
30 geographic regions around UK (figure 1a and ESM figure S5). We excluded locus EV104 from further analyses
31
32 as the proportion of missing data exceeded 10% in some regions (ESM figure S5) and potential null alleles
33 have been recorded in other studies [4]. The genetic diversity (also known as expected heterozygosity, H ) of
e
34
the remaining 9 loci is shown in table 2, and ranges between 0.67 and 0.71 with an average value of 0.69 ± 0.01
35
36 across the six regions. The allelic richness per region ranged between 3.3 and 3.7 alleles for a standardized
37 sample size of 13 individuals (the lowest sample size observed in the Channel area). Overall, none of the loci
38
39 displayed any significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg and Linkage Equilibrium expectations.

43 Differences in allelic frequencies estimated using F between porpoises from the six UK regions ranged
ST
44 between 0.0 and 1.3% (table 3). Only the CWest group in the SW UK display consistently small but significant
45
46 F values when compared to porpoises from the five other geographic regions, indicating that porpoises from
ST
47 that area are differentiated from the others.

50 The individual-based Bayesian clustering analyses of Structure identified two clusters (K) as the best solution
51 explaining the genetic structure of the harbour porpoises from the NE Atlantic as suggested by the posterior
52
53 probability of the data Ln (P ) = 1 for K=2 and by the Evanno’s method based on the rate of change of this
K=2|X
54 posterior probability (figure 2, ESM figure 6a and 6b). The analyses conducted using the local data set along
55
56 the UK coastlines and at a global scale in the NE Atlantic by combining the UK data set together with previous
57 data of Fontaine et al. [4,13] (figure 1) depicted a very similar picture (figure 2 and ESM figure S6 and S7),
58
with a much clearer pattern observed when UK individuals were placed into the global genetic structure of
59
60 the porpoises in the NE Atlantic (figure 2 and ESM figure S6). These two analyses show that porpoises from
the South-Western UK facing the Celtic Sea clearly have admixed ancestry from the northern (blue) and

4 southern (yellow) ecotypes, similar to that previously identified for porpoises from French waters in the
5
6 northern Bay of Biscay, and in Irish waters of the Celtic Sea [13]. These results were consistent across the 10
7 replicated runs conducted for each data set (result not shown). The admixture zone between the two ecotypes
8
is restricted to the northern part of the Bay of Biscay, and southern parts of the Celtic Sea and Channel. It
9
10 includes porpoises found along the Atlantic coasts of France; the southern coasts of Ireland and northern
11 coasts of Devon and Cornwall facing the Celtic Sea; and parts of the Channel. This is shown by the admixture
12
13 proportions estimated at the individual level (figure 2a); as pie-charts on the map showing the averaged
14 admixture proportion per locality (figure 2b); and by colour-coding hybrid individuals which have less than
15
80% of their genome assigned to any of the two clusters (ESM figure S6c).
16
17
18 The newly analysed individuals from the UK coastlines thus allow for further refinement of the delimitation
19
20 this admixture zone. All the porpoises from the South West coasts of UK (CWest) are part of this admixed
21 zone between the two ecotypes, as are individuals from the west coasts of UK and the Channel. This admixed
22
background quickly declines in porpoises further East into the Channel and along the UK coasts of the North
23
24 Sea, as well as Northward along the coasts of Scotland (figure 2).
25
26
27 The spatial Principal Component Analysis (sPCA) conducted only on the UK porpoises provides a similar
28 picture of the fine scale genetic structure along the UK coastline (figure 3). The Global test assessing the
29
30 significance of positive sPCs showed that the first sPC is significant (p = 0.004) and supports the existence of a
31 global genetic structure such as cline or clusters [42]. In contrast, the local test showed that none of the
32
negative sPC were significant (p = 0.598). Plotting the individual scores along the first two positive sPCs
33
34 (figure 3a) showed that porpoises from the SW region of UK (Cwest) depart from the others along the first
35 sPC axis and that the genetic composition of British porpoises gradually changes along a SW-NE geographic
36
37 axis (figure 3a). This spatial structure is also well depicted when plotting individual scores for the sPC1 on a
38 map (figure 3b).
39
40
41 Isolation by distance (IBD) in UK porpoises. We found significant IBD between the 591 porpoises sampled along
42 the UK coasts, indicating that gene flow, and thus individual dispersal, is spatially restricted at that spatial
43
44 scale (table 4). The IBD slope was similar between males and females, as expected since we are analysing
45 autosomal loci that are transmitted by both parents at each generation. When structuring by age-class, only
46
47 the test performed on juveniles was significant, while the test conducted on the adults was not significantly
48 different from zero. This suggests overall IBD signal is primarily related to juveniles, while adults display a
49
higher variance in dispersal.
50
51
52 Morphological analyses of UK porpoises. As previously reported [48], we found that both age and sex were
53
54 significant predictors of the body-length, explaining about 61% of the total variation (Linear model, LM1: F = 2,334
55 261.1, p < 2.2 10 , n=336). We inspected the geographic variation in the residuals (figure 4a and 4b) and
-16
56
observed that porpoises from the SW (Cwest) area as well as some porpoises from the West area of England
57
58 displayed significantly larger body-size compare to the others (one-way ANOVA, F = 15.53, p < 9.9 10 and p <
5
-14
59 0.001 for all Tukey pairwise comparisons involving Cwest, ESM table S1). We also observed a strong
60
correlation between individual residuals of body size and individual genetic admixture proportions estimated
by Structure (Pearson r = 0.39, p = 8.3 10 , figure 3c). Combining the genetic ancestry together with the age and

13 5. Discussion
14
15
16 Harbour porpoises in UK waters are part of a genetic continuum, characterized by a weak genetic structure, in
17 which geographically proximate individuals are genetically more similar, a so called isolation by distance
18
19 (IBD) pattern [4,13]. However, porpoises stranded along the SW coasts of the UK, facing the Celtic Sea and the
20 Atlantic side of the Channel, display significant genetic differentiation compared to other parts of the UK
21
22 (figure 2 and 3). The genetic distinctiveness of the SW UK porpoises was shown independently by pairwise F ST
23 comparisons (table 3), Bayesian clustering analysis (figure 2, ESM figure S6 and S7) and sPCA (figure 3). Body
24
sizes of SW porpoises are significantly larger compared to the rest of the UK (figure 4), being reminiscent of
25
26 the large porpoises of the southern ecotype inhabiting coastal Atlantic waters of Iberia [13,16]. A significant
27 correlation was found between body size and admixture proportion throughout the porpoise distribution
28
29 around the UK. To our knowledge, this represents one of the largest assessment of body size variation in
30 European porpoises to date. It shows that genetic differentiation correlates with the morphological
31
differentiation observed between the northern and southern ecotypes, and suggests a potential genetic basis to
32
33 traits with adaptive significance such body size.
34
35
36 This pattern of genetic and morphological variation in the UK waters is driven by the admixture between the
37 two ecotypes previously identified in the NE Atlantic waters [13]: the southern ecotype known for their large
38
39 body-size [16] inhabits the upwelling waters off Iberia and Mauritania; and the northern ecotype that has
40 smaller body size and lives on the continental shelf north of the Bay of Biscay and spreading northward up to
41
the Arctic waters of Norway and Iceland (figure 2). The dense sampling along the UK coasts belongs to the
42
43 same cohort as previously (1990 – 2000) as those previously analysed in Fontaine et al. [4,13], and provides a
44 refined picture of the global genetic structure, clearly showing for the first time the full delimitation of the
45
46 admixture zone between the two ecotypes in the NE Atlantic. We can now demonstrate that the admixture
47 zone is confined to the northern side of the Bay of Biscay and includes porpoises found along the coasts of
48
France, Celtic Sea, SW UK, southern Irish Sea and the western side of the English Channel (figure 2, 3 and
49
50 ESM figure S6c). The admixture proportions quickly decline along a SW-NE axis around the UK, blending
51 towards pure individuals from the northern ecotype, with a coincident decrease in body size (figure 4).
52
53
54 While Iberian porpoises were already recognised as having larger body sizes compared to the northern
55
56 ecotype [16], the new results show that the admixed porpoises found in the northern part of the Bay of Biscay
57 are also relatively larger compared to the porpoises from the pure northern ecotype. These genetic and
58
phenotypic differences strengthen the case that porpoises from each ecotype are part of demographically
59
60 independent units, relying on distinct environments and different food resources. The local marine
environment where the admixed porpoises from SW UK (CWest area) were living before stranding showed

3
4 substantial differences compared to other regions of UK with waters that are warmer, saltier, and with slightly
5
6 lower surface Chlorophyll concentration on average (figure 5). From a biogeographic perspective, this area
7 encompassing the Celtic Sea , the western English Channel and more generally the northern Bay of Biscay
8
corresponds to a transition between two biogeographic marine zones (the Boereal-Lusitanean transition
9
10 following [49]), the warm-temperate waters and cool-temperate waters [50]. The distribution of this admixture
11 zone (figure 2 and ESM figure S6c) in the northern part of the Bay of Biscay may just reflect a temporal
12
13 snapshot, but could also be indicative of distinct habitat preferences of porpoises from the admixed zone and
14 the southern ecotype compared to those living further north on the continental shelf. It may also be possible
15
that some local adaptive processes are maintaining these two ecotypes as ecologically and demographically
16
17 distinct. Testing these hypotheses would require a temporal study of the evolution of this admixed zone and
18 should include a genome-wide perspective of the genetic differentiation to identify molecular evidence of
19
20 ongoing natural selection.
21
22
Interestingly, porpoises from SW coasts facing the northern part of the Bay of Biscay displayed slightly lower
23
24 genetic diversity compared to more northern porpoises (ESM figure S8). A previous genetic study reported a
25 similar pattern at larger scale in the Bay of Biscay together with a stronger IBD pattern than in the North Sea
26
27 (see table 2 in Fontaine et al. [4] and table S8 in Fontaine et al. [13]). Such reduced genetic diversity in a zone of
28 admixture might appear counter intuitive at first glance, since we would usually expect an increase of genetic
29
30 diversity when two distinct populations meet in a contact zone. However, we showed previously that the
31 genetic diversity of the Iberian population is very low and does not have any private alleles relative to the
32
northern continental shelf populations. Therefore the reduction in diversity of the Biscay contact zone could
33
34 arise through a combination of low genetic diversity of the southern ecotypes, and a high level of
35 unidirectional gene flow from the Iberian population to the northern populations [4,13,18]. This results in a
36
37 smaller effective population size and stronger IBD slope, which is inversely related to the neighbourhood size
38 – the product of local effective density or population size and squared variance of the intergenerational
39
dispersal distance [20,44,45].
40
41
42 The isolation by distance observed around the UK was weak but highly significant, and consistent with
43
44 patterns observed in other parts of the range [4]. When decomposing by age-class, we observed that the IBD
45 pattern was only significant for juveniles but not adults. To assess the ecological significance of this require
46
47 some consideration of the statistical properties of the IBD test. An ideal test would compare IBD slopes
48 between adults and juveniles and not just rely on the statistical significance of the test. However, the
49
individual-based IBD test of Rousset has low power due to the high variance inherent to Rousset’s a r
50
51 estimator, which leads to an imprecise estimate of the slope [44,45]. The fact that the slope of the regression for
52 adults is not different from 0 makes this slope comparison practically impossible, or would require another
53
54 statistical framework, such as a Bayesian or Likelihood approach. As described in Rousset [20,44,45], the
55 strength of IBD and thus the level of genetic differentiation between individuals at a local scale in a
56
continuous population can be quantified by its slope and is inversely proportional to the ‘neighbourhood
57
58 size’. This ‘neighbourhood size’ can be described more precisely as the product of the local effective density D
59
and the variance of intergenerational dispersal distance s . While local effective density or effective population
2
60
size cannot explain the difference we observed between juvenile and adult porpoises because they are part of
the same population, the most biologically sound interpretation is that juveniles have a reduced

2
3 intergenerational dispersal distance compared to adults. Intuitively, this is expected since adults that are
4
5 found stranded have more time and opportunity to disperse further away from their birthplace than juveniles.
6 The intergenerational dispersal distance and especially its variance component should thus be much higher in
7
8 adults than in juveniles, leading to a reduce ability to detect any IBD in adults but not in juveniles. This result
9 is interesting, since it highlights how an indirect genetic approach based on uncontrolled sampling of stranded
10
individuals can be informative for intergenerational dispersal behaviour in a species, such as the harbour
11
12 porpoises, which has a continuous distribution and no geographic constraints on dispersal.

17 6. Conclusion
18
19 The evidence of an admixed contact zone between northern and southern porpoise ecotypes, occurring in the
20 northern Bay of Biscay has been identified recently [13], but the present study fills an important gap along the
21
22 UK coastlines that existed in the sampling distribution of previous studies. Using a very dense sampling
23 around the UK, we were able to map with high resolution the geographic delimitation of the admixture zone,
24
showing that porpoises from the northern Bay of Biscay, Celtic Sea and SW UK were genetically admixed. We
25
26 showed also that the genetic admixture proportions were strongly correlated with the body size of the
27 porpoises, a discriminant morphological feature of the two ecotypes. This study revealed that not only are
28
29 porpoises from the southern ecotype larger compared to the northern ecotype, but so are the admixed
30 porpoises. This suggest that the body size of porpoises may have some genetic determination and also
31
reinforces the idea that the two ecotypes display distinct feeding ecology, with potentially also distinct
32
33 behavioural ecology and habitat preferences.
34 The current delimitation of the admixture zone raises the question of what environmental and ecological
35
36 factors determine the distributions of the ecotypes, extent of the contact zone, and whether the distributions
37 are stable or dynamic. Previous work has shown that the structure and distribution of harbour porpoise
38
39 populations has been influenced by changes in oceanographic conditions which affect food resources [4,13].
40 Therefore the location and extent of the Biscay admixture zone is likely to be similarly dynamic and sensitive
41
to past and future changes in climate which influence shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions. For
42
43 instance warming waters may see a northward expansion of the southern ecotype, which would be detectable
44 by a shift in the extent of the admixture zone around the SW United Kingdom. The data presented here
45
46 represent samples spanning an approximate 12 years window from 1990-2002. Future genetic studies, making
47 use of the now extensive time series of samples spanning several decades available from European cetacean
48
stranding programmes, will help test whether contemporary porpoise populations are showing a dynamic
49
50 response to current climate change, and could be important in understanding how the structure of European
51 marine ecosystems might respond to changes in the populations of such keystone predators [21].

Comments to the Author:
This is a well-designed and important study which will be of interest to those study harbor
porpoise elsewhere. However, the referees have identified a number of issues that must be
addressed before it can be published; in particular, Referee 2 provides some very useful
concrete suggestions for incorporation of the results of other studies into the overall
context of this work. I agree with the referee that this will significantly improve the paper's
value.

Comments to the Author(s)
Fontaine et al. present a very well written and thorough study of population structure of
harbor porpoises around the UK, and within the context of ecotype differentiation in the
North Atlantic. They have used standard genetic methods (microsatellite genotyping, 9 loci)
with dense sampling through a hybrid zone, applying multiple analytical techniques to
demonstrate the strength, pattern, and potential mechanisms for isolation by distance
through the hybrid zone. The genetic results are put into context of the biogeographic
history of the species in the North Atlantic, ecological variables, and implications for the
further analysis of the genetics of body size differences and the potential effects of climate
change. Overall this is a very nicely presented study and I have only a few, minor
suggestions for modifications prior to acceptance for publication.
Details (page No., line No.)
Throughout the text, tables and figures, the subscripts and superscripts are too small to
read.
>> R1. We used the MS Office template from the R Soc Open Sci, which uses a Palatino font
style. Unfortunately, this impaired the readability of subscript and superscripts so we have
changed them to a Times New Roman font to solve the issue.
3, 23: it becomes obvious later that sex was also determined for most specimens, but it
would be helpful to indicate that in the methods where other data types are listed.
>> R2. We added it in the “Sampling section” of the Methodology on p3.
3, 54-55: contents of the PCR reactions should all be given as final concentrations, not
volumes (e.g., 1x PCR buffer, XX units Amplitaq). Also, the text indicates 0.1mM of each
nucleotide, but then says dCTP was at 0.01 mM. Since one is different, it should indicate
that dT, G, ATP were at 0.1mM.
>> R3. We have clarified this part.
4, 22 and 33: In both of these lines, does R refer to Ra? Only Ra is defined.
>> R4. Yes it is. The subscript was present, but not clearly visible because of the font used in
the R Soc Open Sci template. This is now solved.
4, 40: I don’t believe it is necessary to apply a Bonferroni correction to pairwise Fst
comparisons. Each test is independent of the others, and testing a different hypothesis
(differentiation between the specified strata). Bonferroni should only be applied if multiple
tests are for a common null hypothesis such that all would be rejected if any were
significant. However, using the Bonferroni correction is conservative and does not change
the conclusions of the paper.
>> R5. Here multiple comparisons of pair-wise differentiation between groups are
conducted, using a permutation test. We are thus re-using the same groups of samples
multiple times and might find some significant results just by chance, because the Type-I
error probability increase monotonically with the number of tests performed with the
groups. This is explained by Goudet in the help section of the program FSTAT and in Rice
(1989). This is why we applied a Bonferroni correction. We agree with the reviewer that this
is an extremely conservative correction, but the results do not change with or without this
correction. Therefore, we prefer to leave it for statistical consideration.
7, 16: change “any” to “either”
>> R6. Changed
7, 20: insert “of” before “this admixture zone.”
>> R7. Inserted.
7, 27-38: The sPCA analysis provides another way to “picture” fine scale genetic structure.
This paragraph describes the data, but does not explain what additional information is
added by this analysis that is not already apparent from the structure analysis? Is it that it
allows spatially explicit visualization of the individual PC scores?
>> R8. Yes, the spatial Principal Component Analysis (sPCA) conducted on the UK porpoises
provides a similar picture of the fine scale genetic structure along the UK coastline and
confirmed the results obtained by the Bayesian model-based clustering of Structure using a
method that does not rely on any model assumptions. We now describe this in the result
section as well as in the methodological section, citing references that cover this point
(Patterson et al. 2006; Mcvean 2009; Francois & Durand 2010).
Confirmation of the genetic structure by two independent methodologies (here the
Bayesian model-base clustering and a multivariate approach) provides a complementary
view, which doesn’t rely on any model assumption. This is important to check the
consistency between complementary methods that differ in their rational in order to check
the consistency of the results (Patterson et al. 2006; Mcvean 2009; Francois & Durand
2010).
8, 33: insert “as” before “body size.”
>> R9. Done
8, 43: delete “as previously” after “same cohort”.
>> R10. Done.
Table 1: The totals in the bottom line are not the sum of the number of samples in the
individual categories. The legend should explain that the totals include the samples that
could not be assigned to one of the 3 age-sex classes. Also, the numbers in this table are
different from some of the numbers on the maps in ESM figures S1 and S2. These represent
the same data and should be reconciled.
>> R11.The numbers have been reconciled.
Figure 1b needs a legend and needs to be large enough to clearly see the colors (similar to
ESM figure S7). This will be very useful for the reader to see where the regions are, as there
is no other map in the main text that shows where each of the 6 regions are and what
samples are in those regions.
>> R12. As requested by reviewer 1,2, and 3, the figure 1b has been re-drawn with larger
points for the panel b, and we added a legend describing the color-coding.
Figure 2a: The label for Cwest here is abbreviated as UK SW. It should be changed to Cwest
for consistency. The number of samples should also be indicated in the legend, as it’s not
clear from the text how many samples in total were used in this analysis. The text “post-
processed using CLUMPAK [37]” can be deleted, as this is described in the methods.
>> R13.
- UK SW has been changed to UK CWest for consistency with the rest of the text.
- We deleted from the legend “post-processed using CLUMPAK (Kopelman et al.
2015)”
- We added the number of samples in each group between brackets after the name in
the plot

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The MS from M Fontaine et al describes an interesting genetic characterization of the
harbour porpoise along the costs of the UK, including a comparison at a larger geographical
scale thanks to results previously obtained.
Large shifts of the harbour porpoise distribution in the North East Atlantic waters have been
demonstrated in the last decades by field observations (in particular the SCANS 1 and II
campaigns) and geographically targeted stranding monitorings. Along the French Atlantic
coasts in particular, harbour porpoises were scarce 3-4 decades ago, before becoming again
one the most common cetacean.
>> R14. The reviewer refers to the rare occurrence of harbour porpoises along the French
Atlantic coasts 3 – 4 decades ago (in the 1960s - 70s). However, it can be argued that field
observations are directly related to the search effort, and that both recording of strandings
and field observation were not as intensive or systematic as today. This means that those
observations (or lack of observations) might need to be treated cautiously. Nevertheless,
the systematic surveys in the framework of the SCAN survey indeed show that abundance
could have shifted between 1995 and 2005 within the North Sea and adjacent waters (as
described in Hammond et al 2013). However, this may not be representative of variation at
the scale of the whole NE Atlantic. Importantly, the Bay of Biscay and southward were not
covered by the first SCAN in 1995. Thus we would suggest that the available SCAN data
would not allow conclusions about shifted distributions in the key area around the Biscay
contact zone to be drawn at this time.
Two populations of harbour porpoises, separated by the Bay of Biscay, have been
highlighted by Fontaine et al (2007). Since that, and taking into account genetic data as well
as field observations, the existence of a recent admixing zone between the 2 populations
along the French Atlantic coast of France has been proved by others (not cited in the
Fontaine et al. MS). The samples used in the Fontaine et al. MS come from the north of this
admixing zone, whose northern limits were previously not known.
>> R15. We have added some further references, such as Alfonsi et al (2012), to the
introduction.
The study from Fontaine et al is therefore highly interesting, and its results are significant,
because (1) it takes place in a larger European geographic context (see for instance Fontaine
et al 2007, 2008, 2014 ; Alfonsi et al. 2012, Wiemann et al 2010, Sveegaard et al 2015), and
(2) because it extends the previous study of Alfonsi et al on the admixing area along the Bay
of Biscay and the North West Atlantic French coasts. The study uses a very large number of
samples, the experimental procedures and the data analysis are adequate (although I have
some minor remarks on the MM part), the MS is well written, and I therefore think that this
study deserves to be published.
However, in my opinion, different major points should be addressed before the MS can be
published.
- the genetic characterization of the harbour porpoise in the UK waters must certainly take
into account the present knowledge of the harbour porpoise distribution in the UK waters
and along the French Atlantic coasts (as the admixing zone originates from here). The
significance of the results could certainly be improved if the genetic characterization can be
incorporated in a boarder context including distribution variations. For instance, the
introduction could include a description of the variations of the harbour porpoise
distribution in the 3-4 last decades around the UK and in neighboring regions, including the
relevant citations, and the discussion could consider these data to explain the genetic
results observed.
>> R16. As described above, inferences about the change in harbour porpoise distribution
around the Bay of Biscay over the last 3-4 decades need to be treated cautiously, and the
information would not necessarily improve our understanding of the genetic structure in
the context of the current paper. Our sampling spans the 10 years between 1990 and 2000,
so our data is representative of the genetic structure over the last 2 generations of
porpoises. The most relevant external data related to the point raised by the referee come
from the quantitative abundance estimates performed during the SCAN-I and SCAN-II
survey conducted respectively in 1995 and 2005. Unfortunately, SCAN-I was unable to use
any data from the French Atlantic and Iberian coasts, because of the lack of standardised
field observations, and so doesn’t provide a baseline for assessing changes in abundance in
this region. Thus, in the interests of keeping the manuscript concise, we don’t think it would
be helpful to discuss it in detail.
- The Iberian population has been clearly distinguished by others using mtDNA
polymorphisms. The study of M Fontaine et al. would strongly benefit of including mtDNA
data as well. If such data are available, they could be valuably included in the MS, and help
to decipher the genetic structure of the sampling.
>> R17. As the reviewer has underlined, there have been extensive analyses of the
mitochondrial genetic variation in European harbour porpoises over the last 20 years (e.g.
Walton et al. (1997); Tolley and Rosel (2006); Viaud et al (2007); Alfonsi et al (2012);
Fontaine et al (2014)) including the areas around the admixture zone. In this respect,
analyses of the mtDNA variation across Europe has provided important insights that are
discussed in depth in those previous studies (summarised in a recent review just published
by Fontaine (2016) and in the introduction and discussion in this paper).
MtDNA sequence data are currently not available for the UK samples which are the focus of
this paper. The main aim of this study was to refine understanding of the fine scale structure
around the UK and to map the limits of the admixture zone in the northern Bay of Biscay.
Given the single locus, haploid and non-recombining nature of mtDNA, mtDNA variation
would not add significant power to our admixture analyses. Such admixture analyses rely on
the use of multiple independent nuclear markers – microsatellites in our case, and
associated analysis methodologies such as those employed by Structure. Furthermore, one
original aspect of our present study is the extensive use of spatially explicit methodologies
which requires access to the geographic coordinates for each sample. Unfortunately, these
metadata are not available for all the mitochondrial data from previous studies, making it
problematic to integrate all previous mtDNA data into the same analytical framework used
in the current the study.
Given our microsatellite data set already had sufficient power to detect admixture, and
subtle isolation by distance structuring around the UK, and because mtDNA variation is
already well covered in the literature, we would argue the cost in terms of time and
financial resources of adding mtDNA data for the UK samples is not justified, since it would
not alter or enhance the conclusions about the geographic distribution of admixture. Thus
we suggest that mtDNA variation in UK samples is beyond the scope of the current paper,
and will be better addressed in future work.
However, in response to referee comment we have revised the introduction to better
reflect previous findings and add some key references that were considered as lacking for
mtDNA studies (e.g. Alfonsi et al. 2012).
- Some major publications about harbour porpoise genetic characterization and distribution
in the studied area are not cited. In particular, the publication highlighting the existence of
the harbour porpoise admixture zone along the French Atlantic waters, close to the SW of
the UK. The list of reference should therefore be improved and the text of the MS could cite
the results of the previous studies and discus them. They seem to be in perfect adequacy
with the results of the present MS, and will therefore reinforce it.
>>R18. As indicated above, we have revised the introduction and discussion to add some
additional references.
- One quality of the MS is to include morphological data as well as genetic analysis. Would it
be possible to highlight more this part of the study, which strongly supports the existence of
the 2 populations and of the admixing area, and opens news and highly interesting studies
("...suggests a potential genetic basis to traits with adaptive significance such body size")
>> R19. We thank the referee for their encouraging comment about this novel aspect of our
work. While we appreciate the suggestion, we would prefer to be cautious in the level of
emphasis placed on this finding given the observation is based on a correlative relationship,
and the ‘uncontrolled’ nature of the sampling (in the sense that study is based on an ad-hoc
sampling reliant on stranded animals). We feel the current presentation strikes the right
balance in highlighting the novel and interesting nature of the finding, versus the limitations
of the current data. In our view pursuing this line further will be best addressed in future
studies using new approaches that assess genetic variation and association with phenotypic
traits at the whole genome level.
- In this MS, the UK coasts are divided into 6 regions. The abbreviation for these regions are
not homogeneous among regions, and not easy to remember when reading the MS. It
would be relevant (1) to explain how these 6 regions were defined and (2) name them with
simpler (explicit) names
>> R20. This comment overlaps with comments of the 2 other reviewers. We have
addressed it as follow.
1- We have homogenized the name of the geographic regions across the text to
avoid any confusion;
2- We have improved the second panel of Figure 1, describing the 6 eco-geographic
regions defined along the UK coasts and added a legend within the plot which can provide
an easy reading at first glance;
3- We now describe how these 6 zones are defined. They correspond to the main
maritime areas and main stranding zones defined around the UK (figure 1b) by the UK
strandings programme. These include the Channel, the Celtic Sea on the South West UK
coast (CWest), the North Sea North (NSN), the North Sea South (NSS), the West coast
(West) of UK, and West coast of Scotland (WScot). [letter in bold are used to define the
abbreviation].
We hope these modifications improve the readability of the MS.
- the Fig 5 is interesting, but, in my opinion, it is not sufficiently explained, described and
used in the discussion (see previous remark about the morphological data). It could be
removed.
>> R21. While we agree the figure does not feature prominently in the text, we respectfully
suggest that it adds helpful contextual information to the study, demonstrating how
environmental conditions vary around the UK, and differ between UK maritime regions. This
provides link between the environmental conditions and where we find the most
differentiated genetic groups. This is important for the discussion, and one full paragraph on
p11 (the 3rd one extending on p12) relies on this figure. Given the manuscript is relatively
short, we would prefer to retain the figure.
- The abstract is really confusing, and could be rephrased (for instance, the words southern
and northern ecotypes are used but not defined, and cannot be understood without reading
the MS)
>>R22. The abstract cannot exceed 200 words. We have tried to rephrase the abstract to
make it less confusing. Although the word limit does not allow them to be defined explicitly
in the abstract, the terminology of “southern” and “northern” ecotypes provide the
geographic context of their location and follows the terminology used previously in Fontaine
et al (2014) and Fontaine (2016).
Some minor points.
p2 .
L18: not sure that "dispersal is the relevant word in the last sentence of the paragraph
>>R23. The biological definition of dispersal refers to both the movement of individuals
from their birth site to their breeding site ('natal dispersal'), as well as the movement from
one breeding site to another ('breeding dispersal'). Dispersal is thus totally relevant in the
context we address here. [Ronce, O. (2007). "How does it feel to be like a rolling stone? Ten
questions about dispersal evolution". Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics.
38: 231–253. doi:10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.38.091206.095611.]
L27: some important publications are not cited here. Please complete this list
>>R24. Done, see point R15 and R17 above.
L31-36: To my knowledge, Pp meridionalis comes from a suggestion of Fontaine et al 2014,
ME, and is not an official ecotype name (see
https://www.marinemammalscience.org/species-information/list-marine-mammal-species-
subspecies/). Moreover, I am not sure that the west african and iberian populations have
clearly been deciphered, with a sufficient number of samples analyzed. This sentence could
therefore be rephrased.
>> R25. Done - We have re-written this part and mention that this sub-species status is a
proposition suggested by Fontaine et al. (2014), which is currently under consideration by
the taxonomy committee and IUCN. Based on the results in previous studies, the
Mauritanian and Iberian porpoises meet the criteria to be considered distinct ecotypes and
and independent ESUs (following the definition of Moritz, 2002).
With respect to the second part of the reviewer comment. The Iberian population has been
genetically characterized using a sampling of 31 individuals genotyped with 10 microsatellite
loci and sequenced for 1/3 of the mitogenome. The Mauritanian population was genetically
characterized with the same genetic markers and a sampling of 15 individuals. Simulation-
based and empirical studies showed that a sample size between 15 and 30 is usually enough
to properly characterize the genetic variation and allelic frequencies within and between
populations, especially if the goal is to analyze the evolutionary history using phylogenetic
and coalescent methodology (Rosenberg & Nordborg 2002; Rosenberg et al. 2005; Cornuet
et al. 2010; LANDGUTH et al. 2011; Hale et al. 2012; Willing et al. 2012). The results of these
studies suggest that, when possible, increasing the number of loci is more critical than
increasing the sample size in order to refine the parameter estimates.
New species can be described from a phylogenetic and morphologic point of view based on
just on a few individuals (see for example the new species of whales described in 2002 in
Marine Mammal Sciences (Dalebout et al. 2002) based on 5 individuals or the Omura’s
whales originally defined based on 8 individuals (Wada et al. 2003) in Nature 2003, thus a
very limited number of samples.
L32: Fontaine et al 2014 wrote Pp meridionalis (and not meridionnalis)
>> R26. Corrected
L43: same remark as before about the Iberian and Mauritanian populations
>> R27. We respectfully disagree with the reviewer as explained above.
L48: the admixture zone of harbour porpoise along the French Atlantic coast has been
recently studied and described. Please cite this publication as well.
>> R28. We added the reference.
P3:
L4: same remark as before: the admixture zone of harbour porpoise along the French
Atlantic coast has been recently studied and described. Please cite this publication as well.
>> R29. We added the reference, but please read our previous remarks above.
L13: Why speaking only about climate change? The area studied is concerned by other
possible environmental changes, most of them of anthropogenic origin.
>> R30. The reviewer is correct that the area around the northern Bay of Biscay, and
southern Celtic Sea is subject to a range of other anthropogenic pressures such as intensive
fishing and shipping traffic. We chose to focus on environmental change and admixture here
because there is already strong case for environmental factors acting as drivers for
population structure in porpoises. Evaluating impacts from other anthropogenic activities
on genetic structure would require substantial additional data relating to these activities.
We feel such data and analyses are beyond the scope of the current paper. Moreover the
nature of the sampling coming from stranded carcasses probably would not have sufficient
spatial and temporal resolution to address issues arising from impacts from shipping etc. in
the present framework.
Sampling:
It could be relevant to give more information about the origin of samples (total numbers of
stranded or by-caught porpoises, variation (if any) of these proportions by class age or sex).
>>R31. The distribution of the sampling per age class, sex and years is provided in
supplementary material (Table 1, and ESM Figure S1 to S4).
The criterion used to define the age class could be specified, as well as the sexing method.
>>R32. Following this comment and the one of reviewer 3, we have added the protocol used
and which rely on standardized necropsy protocols in place in the UK stranding network.
L45: You therefore assume that all stranded porpoises died at less than 50km of their
stranding place. Could you discuss this?
>>R33. In the absence of other data on carcass origins we use the assumption that a 50km
radius would provide a representative view of the environmental conditions where the
porpoises were swimming before dying and stranding. As we stated in the text, this is an
arbitrary threshold given the absence of additional information. We made sure this was
clearly stated in the text.
L51: the sequences of the primers could be specified
>>R34. We have added a new table in the supplementary material (Table S1) providing
those information, as well as annealing temperature and the relevant references.
L55: the amount of TAQ pol could be more efficiently expressed in enzymatic units
>>R35. Done (as also suggested by the reviewer 1)
L57: I am not really sure that you use "nucleotide" here. deoxyNucleoside TriPhosphate
more likely.
L57: "and 0.01mM of 32P labelled dCTP". the following sentence could be rephrased.
>>R36. We have corrected that section.
L59: "second annealing temperature" = ?
L60: "annealing temperature" = ?
>>R37. We revised this part and provided annealing temperature within the Table S1.
P4:
Subscript and superscript characters are too small to be read
>>R38 Corrected – see point R1
L20: regions on fig 1a or 1b?
>>R39. Fig 1b., corrected.
L26 (and L37): what is the specific interest of using diveRsity?
>>R40. The package diveRsity was used to calculate the F-statistics (FIS and FST) as well as
the 95%CI as mentioned in the text.
L32: using sample sizes of only 2 individuals should be justified.
>>R41. Since we analysed only grid cells where there was at least 2 individuals, this is
required that the allelic richness is calculated based on a minimum sample size of 2 for the
spatial variation in Ra.
L43: was the Bayesian analysis first performed using no prior information? This would be
relevant.
>>R42. Yes, but as explained in the answer to reviewer 3 (see R56) and in our paper, we only
present the version with prior to remain consistent with our previous study in 2014 which
has demonstrated the usefulness of using the LocPrior Model in the case of harbour
porpoises in the NE Atlantic (See Fig S2 and S3 in Fontaine et al 2014).
L60: I am not sure that all readers will be familiar with CLUMPAK/ Its principle and interests
could be described.
>>R43. While we appreciate the sentiment behind this suggestion we would like to keep the
manuscript succinct. We currently briefly describe that we used CLUMPAK and custom-R
scripts for comparing replicates to each other and identify potential distinct clustering
modes, estimates the change of likelihood, estimate the best K value using the Evanno’s
method (Evanno et al. 2005), and plot the results. For additional explanation, the reader is
directed to the cited paper presenting the program.
P5
L10: this is the first description of the UK regions. it should come before in the MS. also, the
definition of these regions should be justified.
>>R44. We agree and have now put the definition of these 6 zones, zones which correspond
to the main distinct maritime areas around the UK, at the end of the sampling section.
L42: (estimated ...demes): this could be explained more clearly
>>R45. FST/(1-FST) between demes is a standard description in classic population genetic
textbook. A deme is a sub-population (a smaller group within the population) that can freely
interbreed. We don’t believe this is the place to define this terminology here if we want to
keep the manuscript at a reasonable size.
P6
L30: fig 1a of 1b?
>>R46. Figure 1b, now corrected in the text
L35: allelic richness values; clarify with table 2
>>R47. We corrected the values in the text.
P8
L58: not sure that demographically independent units still exist
>>R48. We are not referring to Distinct Segment Unit (DSU) as previously used in
conservation genetics. Here, we use Demographically independent unit in the original
biological/demographic sense. Populations are said to be demographically independent
when their allelic frequency are not correlated to each other anymore (Palsbøll et al. 2007).
P9
L41-58 the paragraph could be shortened and clarified, and the difference between juvenile
and adults should be discussed more and extended.
>>R49. We have improved this section following reviewer 2 and 3.
Fig1
there are no A and B
>>R50. Fixed
some dark dots appear in the blue and green UK regions. could this be avoided?
The grey dots are hardly visible
>>R51. Dots have been enlarged and the figure improved and the entire figure has been
regenerated and improved.
How were the 6 region defined?
>>R52. This is now clarified in the sampling section.

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Fontaine et al,
Thanks for an interesting and well-written ms contributing yet another piece of the puzzle
to understanding the many factors driving porpoise abundance and distribution in the NE
Atlantic. I only have minor comments relating to the division of samples into subregions for
the structure analysis, as well as the interpretation of the IBD results. These and others are
specified in the attached pdf.
Congratulations on a nice study,

>> R55. This was due to the font used by R Soc Open Sci word template. This is now fixed.
P5, 8: I understand the need to divide into regions for the STRUCTURE analysis, but also feel
it introduces a potential bias. Have you considered using e.g. Geneland as a supplement to
the STRUCTURE analyses?
>>R56. The Locprior model recently introduced by Hubisz et al in 2009 in Structure provides
a same type of clustering model base model as the one offered by Geneland, relying on
minimizing HW and LD disequilibrium within cluster. However, Structure offer a few
significant advantages: (1) it provides better mixing properties of the MCMC sampler based
on our own personal experience. In addition, (2) the LocPrior model provides a better
control of the prior information in a practical, transparent and explicit way. In contrast,
Geneland uses a Voronoi tessellation to partition the space into tiles/polygons, with each
sample becoming the centre of a tile. Samples within the same tile or from adjacent tiles get
a higher prior probability to belong to the same cluster than more distant ones. This process
assumes that the samples are distributed randomly across the landscape. Our study departs
significantly from this assumption in various ways: First, we are working with a marine
species. This means that land areas should be exclude from this tiling process, but it is
practically impossible to do it in Geneland. Secondly, and more importantly, most of our
samples come from strandings and the geographic locations follow the coastlines. This
makes the tiling process problematic and the reliability very questionable – since it would
evaluate spatial separation on the basis of Euclidean distances, rather than marine distances
around the coast. We thus preferred to use the Locprior model of Structure and partition
the space into 6 eco-geographic zones which have a sound biological and statistical rational.
Furthermore, Hubisz et al (2009) designed the Locprior model to improve the ability of
Structure to detect weak signals of structure and admixture or with additional precision
without introducing bias or forcing the clustering (see details in Hubisz et al. 2009). We
showed previously how well this model was performing for the porpoise’s dataset at the
scale of the North East Atlantic (Fontaine et al. 2014, Mol Ecol). We thus decided to use the
same clustering analyses as previously done in order to remain consistent and make the
results of this new study fully comparable with our previous ones (see Fontaine et al. 2014,
Mol Ecol.)
Finally, we used a spatial Principal Component analysis of Jombart et al (2008) to validate
the results identify by Structure. This sPCA provides an independent methodology which
does not rely on any specific model-base assumptions and no priors. This is complementary
to the Bayesian Clustering of Structure as suggested by many authors (see Patterson et al
2006, MacVean 2009 and Francois and Durand 2010).
P5, 40: we removed isolation by distance
>> Done
P5, 57: Not sure I follow this. If e.g. males are more dispersed than females in general, and
hence at time of sampling, I would expect this to be reflected in the genetic data, or?
>>R57. Our original statement was based on the fact that nuclear loci are usually not the
best loci to look at sex-biased dispersal. But the reviewer is indeed correct that if a sex is
dispersing more than another, at the time of the sampling we could expect to see a
difference. We thus agree with the reviewer and have modified the text accordingly.
P5, 59: Wouldn’t we typically expect juveniles to disperse more than adults, at least for
mammals?
>>R58. I suppose this is a species-specific trait and usually observed in terrestrial mammals.
In turn, we know little about dispersal behaviour of cetacean species between age-class. In
harbour porpoises the only solid bond known is between a calf and his mother. Thus before
weaning, young porpoises remain with their mothers, and we can expect that their dispersal
abilities will be reduced compared to adults. Furthermore, since females tend to be
philopatric in porpoises, then so are the young porpoises. Thus, we may expect a lower
dispersal, in average, in juveniles compared to adults. Our sentence was just to say that IBD
pattern could differ between age classes. This is all we imply at this point in the MS.
P6,30: Was this locus also analysed in the total data? That is, does the total data set consist
of 6 or 5 loci?
>> R59. Ten loci were analysed in the UK dataset, minus EV104 (because of null allele
issues), leaving 9 loci, as specified on line 34 of the same page.
For the Bayesian clustering analyses using Structure, we ran the analysis for the UK data set
(9 loci for 592 samples) and for the ‘global’ analysis - UK data combined with previously
published data of Fontaine et al (2014, 10 loci, 676 samples) leading to a total of 13 loci
analysed for 1268 samples - there 6 loci overlapping between the 2 studies. We added those
details in the methodological section “Bayesian genetic clustering analyses” on p5.
P7, 44: Not sure I am following this. If age-structured data can provide inference about
dispersal bias, why can’t a sex-structured dataset? Yes, males and females both transmit
autosomal loci, but so do juveniles when the grow up...so rather that interpreting the
patterns on an "evolutionary scale" I would simply take the results to reflect a snapshot at
"ecological scale"
>>R60. We agree with this suggestion and revise the text following that suggestion.
P9, 13: yes, and food availability. Given their small body size, porpoises typically need to eat
continuously (e.g. Wisniewska et al 2016 Curr Biol), so large body size could be an
adaptation to lower prey availability and larger home ranges
Do we know anything about the diet of porpoises in the different areas, e.g. from stomach
contents or stable isotopes?
>> R61. To our knowledge, the fine scale geographic variation in feeding ecology has not
been investigated in detail. Now that we see geographic variation in the genetic make-up of
the porpoises around UK, it is our hope that these results will foster interest in
characterizing local variation in feeding ecology.
P10, 3: Well, if the adults disperse, then we would expect their offspring to reflect the
genetic signature of their parents' birthplace, and not the signature of the place they are
born...unless adults in general disperse, return to natal site to breed during the breeding
season, and then disperse again the rest of the year... so, we have to distinguish between
permanent dispersal, and a more temporal pattern of movements e.g. for foraging.
I would expect the IBD data to reflect a temporal snapshot of the whereabouts of each
animal at the time of stranding
>>R62. This is indeed what is supposed to happen in porpoises. Adult females are supposed
to return to natal sites to breed during the breeding season, and then disperse again for
foraging. We have added some detail.
In mammals, juveniles typically disperse more than adults, which is opposite to your
observation. Please elaborate.
>> R63. See above- we have provided further details.

Dear editor, dear reviewer,
We wish to thank you for the very positive feedbacks. We agree with reviewer 2 that future studies
making use of the now extensive time series of samples spanning several decades available from
European cetacean stranding programmes, combining population genetics with indicators of population
movements such as those coming from stranding networks (Peltier et al. 2013) and field surveys
(Hammond et al. 2013), will help test whether contemporary porpoise populations are showing a
dynamic response to current climate change, and could be important in understanding how the structure
of European marine ecosystems might respond to changes in the populations of such keystone predators
(Beaugrand et al. 2015). We have added this statement in the last two sentences of the conclusions.
Regarding the increased numbers of strandings reported by Pikesley et al. (2011) along the south west
coasts of UK, this is not specific to only that area. Peltier et al. (2013) showed that stranding records
have increased dramatically in the Southern North Sea, Western and Eastern Channel, and northern Bay
of Biscay especially since 2000. As acknowledged by Peltier and colleagues, this is consistent with
population movements reported from field surveys between 1995 and 2005 (Hammond et al. 2013).
However, it would be currently speculative to relate this increase in porpoises standings with the
population of origin. Nevertheless, we agree that combining these observations with genetic analyses in
future studies will likely lead to a better understanding of the dynamic response of the harbour porpoises
to current climate change.
