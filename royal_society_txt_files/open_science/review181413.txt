This study reported the use of organic-metallic hybrid charring material as a flame retardant.
Although the authors have done a lot of characterization work, the current version would need
some revisions before it can be considered for publication. Some comments as below:
-Abbreviations should not be used in the title.
-The authors claimed it is a metallic hybrid, but what they used is ZnO which is an oxide. This is
very misleading.
-Many abbreviations such as SCTCA are not specified.
-The TEM images of Fig. 1 do not look good. The ZnO nanoparticles look more like aggregates.
The SCTCA@ZnO looks entirely different than ZnO with different electron densities. However,
SCTCA modification shouldn’t change the TEM contrast of ZnO.
-The TGA curves in Fig. 8 do not really have any significant differences between samples. The
minor difference could be just due to experimental variations.
-A lot of the measurements in the study are based on one-time measurement which is a potential
issue.
-Each fitted peak in XPS spectra should be labeled.
-There are a lot of grammar mistakes and typos, even in the title of the manuscript. This would
really need a lot of work on it.
-Besides the smoke production and release. Some other performance characterization as a flame

Appendix A
Dear Editors,
Thank you for your letter and the reviewers’ comments
concerning our manuscript entitled “Enhancement of an
organic-metallic hybrid charring agent on flame retardacy of EVA”.
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and
improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to
our researches. We have uploaded a revised manuscript plus responses
to the reviewers’ comments that we feel addresses adequately all the
issues proposed. Words in green are the changes for the comments of
Referees in the modified manuscript. The corrections and responses to
the reviewer’s comments are as following:
Responses to the reviewers’ comments:
Reviewer: 1
Comment 1: Abbreviations should not be used in the title.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s kind advice. According to
the reviewer’s suggestion, the title has been changed to “Enhancement
of an organic-metallic hybrid charring agent on flame retardancy of
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer” in the modified manuscript.
Comment 2: The authors claimed it is a metallic hybrid, but what
they used is ZnO which is an oxide. This is very misleading.
Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. Based on
the definition, hybrid materials are composites consisting of two
constituents at the nanometer or molecular level. Commonly one of
these compounds is inorganic (including inorganic oxide, metal oxide,
etc) and the other one organic in nature and they are connected by the
covalent bonds. The synthetic idea of hybrid polymer materials is that
if there are groups on the polymer chain that can participate in the
hydrolysis and condensation process, through the hydrolysis and
condensation of these functional groups with inorganic precursors, the
organic polymer and inorganic hybrid polymer materials can be
formed by covalent bonding. Thus, they differ from traditional
composites where the constituents are at the macroscopic (micrometer
to millimeter) level. Mixing at the microscopic scale leads to a more
homogeneous material that either shows characteristics in the two
original phases or even new properties. Specific to this work,
nano-ZnO as a nanometer scale inorganic metal oxide was modified by
the triazine oligomer containing functional groups of silicon ethoxy
and the two could be connected by the covalent bonds generated
through the hydrolysis and condensation of these functional groups
with hydroxyl on nano-ZnO, forming a nanometer scale composite.
Based on this, the composite in this work was regarded as metallic
hybrid material.
At the same time, we have also consulted some previous works
and found some metallic hybrids with metal oxides as raw materials.

Comment 3: Many abbreviations such as SCTCA are not
specified.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. According to
your suggestion, we have identified the abbreviations of the flame
retardants again:
OTCA: organic triazine charring agent.
HOTCA: hydrolyzed OTCA.
OTCA@ZnO: organic triazine charring agent hybrid with zinc
oxide.
HOTCA/ZnO: physical blending of HOTCA and nano-ZnO.
Comment 4: The TEM images of Fig. 1 do not look good. The ZnO
nanoparticles look more like aggregates. The SCTCA@ZnO looks
entirely different than ZnO with different electron densities.
However, SCTCA modification shouldn ’ t change the TEM
contrast of ZnO.
Response: Thanks for your comment. As seen from Fig. 1(a),
nano-ZnO possessed shapes like long rods and strongly aggregated
into clusters of several micrometers in size due to the high surface
energy and lots of hydroxyl groups on the surface. The average
particle size of 80 nm × 15 nm of nano-ZnO and yet the aggregation
was measured by a 500 nm scale. In fact, the aggregation for
nanometer metal oxide particles commonly appears due to the high
surface energy and they will agglomerate into clusters much larger
than 500 nm rather than being dispersed at a particle size of nanometer
each, which will strongly affect the dispersion and distribution of
particles in the matrix. Thus the organic surface modification of
nanometer particles may be an optimized way to obstruct the
aggregation of nanometer particles. Just for this reason, this paper
hybridizes nano-zinc oxide with organic charring agent in order to
improve the dispersion of nano-zinc oxide, which is the primary goal
of this work.
In fact, the goals of TEM tests were to identify the influence of
hybridization on the dispersion of nano-ZnO, though the contrast
difference of the test results may be because the operators are different
twice, responded by the testing organization for TEM images in Figure
1. From Figure 1(a, b), the contrast of particles´ morphology and size
before and after hybridization of nano-ZnO was enough obvious.
OTCA@ZnO showed a distribution like “seeds” in “melons”, and we
selected a seed to enlarge, as shown in Figure 1(c). It was not difficult
to see from the enlarged Figure 1(c) that although the nano-zinc oxide
still agglomerated, its particle size had been reduced from much more
than 500 nm to about 100 nm, indicating that the dispersion of
nano-zinc oxide after hybridization was improved in organic
char-forming agent. This may be explained by that the hybridization
consumed the surface hydroxyl groups through the condensation
reactions and lowered the surface energy of nano-ZnO. The organic
modifier layer covering on surface of nano-ZnO generated the large
steric hindrance, obstructing the aggregation of particles. However,
unlike the seeds in melons, the inorganic and organic interfaces are not
so clear, because the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the nano-zinc
oxide and the hydroxyl groups on the OTCA undergo condensation
reaction, which improves the interfacial compatibility of the two, and
at the same time, most of particles of OTCA@ZnO showed darker
center and lighter edger, which was typical of hybridization structure
of inorganic nanometer particles.
Comment 5: The TGA curves in Fig. 8 do not really have any
significant differences between samples. The minor difference
could be just due to experimental variations.
Response: Thanks. Your observation is very careful and indeed,
some of the curves seemed little significant difference, such as the
curves between OTCA@ZnO and IFR, APP and IFR-Cal. In fact, each
test has been carried out more than once in the experimental process to
eliminate potential errors. For this TGA section, our primary goal was
to demonstrate synergy effect between OTCA@ZnO and APP, which
could be seen from the two curves of IFR and IFR-Cal. The
experimental T5% and Tp of IFR-3 both were lower than those of the
theoretical values, which indicated the thermal degradation behaviors
of APP/OTCA@ZnO changed as their incorporation and APP
promoted the degradation of IFR. Further, IFR-3 with more residues
had better charring ability than the calculation value especially in high
temperature.
First of all, the two curves of OTCA@ZnO and IFR seemed close
to each other, but the initial decomposition temperatures were
significantly different. This indicated that the synergy of OTCA@ZnO
and APP made IFR decompose earlier. In fact, the contrast of the two
curves of OTCA@ZnO and IFR was of no significance, and it was
also normal for the char residues of both to be similar, even if the char
residues of OTCA@ZnO was higher or lower than that of IFR,
because the amount of char was not the exclusive crucial factor on the
properties of flame retardants.
Secondly, for the two curves of APP and IFR-Cal, it could be
clearly seen that the calculated IFR-Cal was closer to the thermal
weight loss process of APP. As you said, the two curves are almost the
same and it was really easy to be regarded as certain experimental
errors. In fact, this was because APP accounted for a large part (2/3) of
IFR, so that the calculated theoretical curve was very close to APP
curve. On the contrary, it was the fact that the two almost identical
curves proved the addition of OTCA@ZnO had greatly demonstrated
the synergy effect between OTCA@ZnO and APP, rather than simply
mixing.
Comment 6: A lot of the measurements in the study are based on
one-time measurement which is a potential issue.
Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. For the
experiments in this work, more than once tests have been carried out
for each formula in parallel. The principle insisted on was that each
formula was tested twice, and if the two results were the same or there
were only very small differences for each samples, it was considered
reasonable and adopted. On the contrary, if the results of the two
repeated tests were significantly different, the third test would be
executed until repeatable results were obtained. At the same time, the
tests were in full compliance with international standards. For example,
a calorimeter was used to test two samples per formula. In addition,
every test was done according to its standards. Limited oxygen index
(LOI) values were measured according to American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) D2863-17. UL-94 vertical burning
rating tests were performed following the procedures in ASTM
D3801-10. The forced combustion behavior was measured according
to ISO 5660-1. In a word, the purpose of these was to reduce the error
caused by the accidental experiment, ensuring the objectivity and
accuracy of the experimental results.
Comment 7: Each fitted peak in XPS spectra should be labeled.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. According to
your suggestion, each fitted peak in XPS spectra was labeled as
follows.

Comment 8: There are a lot of grammar mistakes and typos, even
in the title of the manuscript. This would really need a lot of work
on it.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s kind advice. We have invited
a native English speaker to read this manuscript and corrected the
grammar mistakes, which were marked in green in the revised
manuscript.
Comment 9: Besides the smoke production and release. Some
other performance characterization as a flame retardant should be
added, especially given that the mass loss seems very marginal without
statistical analysis.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s kind advice. In this work, the
flame retardancy and thermal behaviour of intumescent flame retardant
EVA composites combining OTCA@ZnO and ammonium
polyphosphate (APP) were investigated using limited oxygen index
(LOI), UL-94 vertical burning, cone calorimetry and TGA. The
structure and morphology of chars were investigated by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR, laser Raman spectroscopy analysis
(LRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results revealed
that the flame retardancy and smoke suppression properties of EVA
were significantly improved by introducing APP/OTCA@ZnO. TGA
results indicated that APP/OTCA@ZnO presented an excellent
synergistic effect and promoted the char formation of EVA composites.
Residue analysis results showed more char with high quality
connected by richer P-O-C, P-N and P-O-Si structures was formed in
APP/OTCA@ZnO system than APP/HOTCA/ZnO system, which
consequently suppressed more efficiently the combustion and smoke
production due to the in situ catalytic carbonization effect of hybrid.
For the flame retardant, the organic triazine charring agent hybrid with
zinc oxide (OTCA@ZnO) was well characterized through fourier
transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), solid state nuclear magnetic
resonance (SSNMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Results revealed that OTCA@ZnO
exhibited excellent thermal stability and dispersity after hybridization.
For an IFR system, commonly these tests could well characterize the
flame retardant properties and the properties of the flame retardants.
Lots of previous works also referred these characterizations and maybe
the performance characterizations in previous references were less
than those in this work. If you insist on still lacking performance
characterizations, please kindly tell us the specific methods, which
would be carried out in the future.
Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions again.
Reviewer: 2
Based on the other reviewer´ suggestions, the abbreviations
appearing below: SCTCA, HSCTCA, SCTCA@ZnO and
SCTCA/ZnO have been replaced by the modified ones: OTCA,
HOTCA, OTCA@ZnO and HOTCA/ZnO, respectively.
Comment 1: In abstract, page 2 line 40-42. The authors mentioned
the comparison of the EVA/APP/SCTCA@ZnO and
EVA/APP/SCTCA/ZnO systems, but in the subsequent text, they
used hydrolyzed product HSCTCA/ZnO. Why did the authors use
the hydrolyzed product HSCTCA/ZnO as a control rather than
the compound of SCTCA with ZnO?
Response: Thank you very much for your question. In fact, this
issue has been considered in this experiment, and the reasons for using
the hydrolyzed product HOTCA/ZnO (HSCTCA/ZnO) as a control
rather than OTCA/ZnO (SCTCA/ZnO) were as follows:
From the synthesis process of OTCA@ZnO seen in Scheme 2,
the ethoxy groups of <U+03B3>-aminopropyltriethoxy silane became firstly
hydroxyl groups after hydrolysis. Next, a part of the hydroxyl groups
of the OTCA after hydrolysis condensed with the hydroxyl groups on
the surface of nano-ZnO, and the other part of hydroxyl groups
self-condensed. Further, the hydrolysis product of OTCA named as
HOTCA was prepared following the same procedure except for
without nano-ZnO, and HOTCA physically blended with nano-ZnO
would be used as a comparative object of the hybrid OTCA@ZnO. In
order to get closer to the real situation of the compound, the
hydrolyzed product HOTCA, physically blending with nano-ZnO
(HOTCA/ZnO), was used as a control rather than the mixture of
OTCA with nano-ZnO, because the network structure after
self-condensation of hydroxyl groups was more similar to that of
OTCA@ZnO.
In addition, the flame retardant properties of
EVA/APP/OTCA/ZnO composite with the same addition amount and
ratio of EVA/APP/HOTCA/ZnO were investigated in the experiment
process, and unexpectedly, the properties were less than those of
EVA/APP/HOTCA/ZnO composite containing the hydrolyzed product
HOTCA, not to mention EVA/APP/OTCA@ZnO. Meantime, the
thermal properties of OTCA were also measured, and yet it was found
both the thermal stability and char forming ability were inferior to the
hydrolyzed product HOTCA.
Thus, considering the above issues, the hydrolyzed product
HOTCA blending with nano-ZnO (HOTCA/ZnO) rather than
OTCA/ZnO was used as a comparative object of the hybrid
OTCA@ZnO.
Comment 2: In introduction, extensive literature regarding
current progress on the flame retardants EVA composites should
be included. In addition, the research progress about ZnO as flame
retardant of polymer should be reviewed.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s kind advice. We have added
the current progress on the flame retardants EVA composites and the
research progress about ZnO as flame retardant of polymer into
introduction, which were labeled in green, and the according
references were added in the revised manuscript.
Comment 3: Clarify the novelty of this study, compared with other
similar research.
Response: At present, lots of flame retardant synergist, such as
ZnO, have been widely studied to enhance the efficiency of IFR
systems on polymers. It was reported that a small amount of metal
oxides (e.g. ZnO and La2O3) could significantly improve the thermal
stability and flame retardancy of IFR composites. However, the
existing works showed metal oxides were usually blended physically
with IFR in polymers and thus it was difficult for the mixtures to fully
show their synergism due to the very low loading amounts and serious
reunion of oxides. The final properties of polymeric composites
strongly depend on particles’ dispersion and distribution in the matrix.
Moreover, the weak compatibility of metal oxides in composites also
was a severe disadvantage, which deteriorated the physical and
mechanical properties. Although the synergistic effect of the metal
oxide and the conventional flame retardant improved the flame
retardancy of materials, the polarity of the inorganic metal compound
was largely different from that of the polymer matrix and easily
agglomerated, if it was physically added. So, the organic surface
modification of metal oxides, especially employing those modifiers
with fire resistance, may be a prospective method, which would not
only settle the above matters, but also bring more efficient synergistic
effect of metal oxides within one compound unit with flame retardants.
Silicon-containing compounds are types of environment-friendly
and highly efficient flame retardants which could form a protective
carbonaceous layer with excellent barrier effect at high temperature. It
was reported that silicone could comparatively lower the heat release
rate and release product of toxic gas (CO), and the synergistic effect
was especially obvious between silicone and IFR with the protective
char layer containing Si-O and Si-C bonds. Further, silicones could
improve the interfacial compatibility of fillers and matrix by chemical
interactions, which regulated the structure and property of composites.
In this work, based on the flame retardant effectiveness of triazine
compounds and silicon, and the synergistic effect of ZnO, a hybrid
organic-metallic charring agent (OTCA@ZnO) had been prepared.
The flame retardancy and thermal stability of EVA composites
containing APP and OTCA@ZnO were studied through LOI, UL-94,
cone test and TGA. The residues were studied to explore the
flame-retardant mechanism by SEM, FTIR, LRS and XPS.
APP/HOTCA/ZnO system as a comparing subject of
APP/OTCA@ZnO system was also systematically investigated to
identify the more efficient flame-retardant action of the hybrid system.
There are many special features of this work. Firstly, the flame
retardant interacts with the metal oxide and exists in the same
molecular unit, which realizes the organic unification of modification
and catalysis, and greatly improves the flame retardant efficiency.
Secondly, the surface modification of the metal oxide is used to solve
the problem of compatibility of inorganic metals. The problem that the
organic small molecule flame retardant is easy to migrate is also
solved. Thirdly, the dispersibility of the nano metal oxide is improved,
and the structure of the organic char-forming agent encapsulating the
nanoparticle effectively improves the mechanical properties of the
polymer. At the same time, cyanuric chloride is a kind of C and N
alternating benzene ring-like structure, which has good char forming
ability, and silicon-containing compounds are types of
environment-friendly and highly efficient flame retardants which
could form a protective carbonaceous layer with excellent barrier
effect at high temperature.
Comment 4: Clarify SCTCA.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s kind advice. OTCA meant the
organic triazine charring agent. The structure of OTCA was added into
the revised manuscript as following scheme:
Scheme 1. Route for the synthesis of OTCA
Comment 5: How to determine the feeding ratio for the
preparation of SCTCA?
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s question. Based on the
different reactivity of the three chlorine atoms in the on the triazine
ring, the first one was substituted by <U+03B3>-aminopropyltriethoxy silane at
0 oC, and the remaining two chlorine atoms are replaced by an amino
group on two ethylene diamines at 50 oC and 100 oC, respectively. So
the molar ratio of <U+03B3>-aminopropyltriethoxy, CYC and EDA is 1:1:1.2.
Comment 6: Describe the reaction mechanism for the preparation
of SCTCA with a schematic.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. Based on the
different reactivity of the three chlorine atoms in the on the triazine
ring, the first one was substituted by <U+03B3>-aminopropyltriethoxy silane at
0 oC, and the remaining two chlorine atoms are replaced by an amino
group on two ethylene diamines at 50 oC and 100 oC, respectively. The
reaction mechanism of OTCA was added into the revised manuscript
and was as following:
Scheme 1. Route for the synthesis of OTCA
Comment 7:2.2, what was used to adjust pH value?
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s question. 5 wt% ammonia
solution was used to adjust pH value.
Comment 8:P4, “Scheme 1 presented the routes of synthesis for
SCTCA and SCTCA@ZnO”, but the route for SCTCA synthesis
was missed.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s kind suggestion. In order to
more clearly represent the structure of the compound, we have added
the scheme 1 as following:
Scheme 1. Route for the synthesis of OTCA
Scheme 2. Route for the synthesis of OTCA@ZnO
Comment 9: The full names for all abbreviations should be given
when they appear for the first time, such as TGA, LRS and PHRR.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s kind advice. We have
carefully checked the manuscript and the full names for all
abbreviations had been given when they appear for the first time, such
as TGA, LRS and PHRR, marked in green in the revised manuscript.
Comment 10:P7, what are HSCTCFA, HSCTFA/ZnO and
SCTCFA-ZnO? They are not consistent with the expressions in the
text and table! Please use the same expressions in full text, figures
and tables!
Response: Thank you very much for your advice. For the
abbreviation of the referred compounds in the manuscript, it was our
mistake, leading to unwanted confusing. In the modified manuscript,
all the compounds have given the modified abbreviations marked in
green, which were consistent in full text, figures and tables. The
modified abbreviations were as follows:
OTCA: organic triazine charring agent.
HOTCA: hydrolyzed OTCA.
OTCA@ZnO: organic triazine charring agent hybrid with
nano-ZnO.
HOTCA/ZnO: physical blending of HOTCA and nano-ZnO.
Comment 11:Page 3 line 38-42 “Firstly, 20 mL DMAc solution
containing 32 g <U+03B3>-aminopropyltriethoxy silane was added into
athree-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. Then, 27 g
CYC and 14.6 g TEA in 20 mLDMAc was slowly added dropwise
with vigorously stirring in an external ice bath”. Was it ice bath or
ice-water bath? What was the temperature? In addition, the
reaction temperature was gone up to 50 0C after three hours. If ice
bath was used, how to increase the temperature? The description
is too confusing.
Response: Thank you very much for your question. It was our
fault that the description of the reaction condition was vague. “an
external ice bath” indicated ice-water bath and the temperature was
kept at 0 oC for three hours. Then the reaction temperature was gone
up to 50 oC in oil bath. According to your valuable suggestions, this
section has been added in the revised manuscript marked in green.
Comment 12:Page 3 line 51-52 “After dried to a constant weight
under vacuum, the intermediate SCTCA (light yellow powder) was
obtained”. What was the drying temperature?
Response: Thank you very much for your question. It was also
our fault that the drying temperature of the products was not given in
the manuscript. The drying temperature was 100 oC. This has been
modified in the revised manuscript and marked in green.
Comment 13: Page 4 Line 3-4, what is the purpose for activation
of nano ZnO? Is there any reference?
Response: Thank you very much for your question, which is very
valuable. The purpose for activation of nano-ZnO was to produce
hydroxyl groups on its surface under high temperature conditions, so
that the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the nano-ZnO could be
condensed with the hydroxyl groups on OTCA (SCTCA). There were
lots of references about the surface modification of nanometer oxide
particle and in fact, the activation to generate hydroxyl groups on the
surface of the nanometer oxide particles, such as nano-ZnO,
nano-TiO2, nano-SiO2 and so on, was a common and typical method in
the similar studies. For example, Chen-Chi M. Ma et al [1] has
mentioned “Surface modified with coupling agents: Nano scale zinc
oxide powders were dried for 24 h, and then put into the reactor.
VTES (C8H18O3Si) and PTES (C12H20O3Si) were used as the
coupling agents and mixed with nanoscale zinc oxide powder,
respectively. The weight ratio of the coupling agent and nanoscale zinc
oxide powder was 20:1. THF was used as solvent and small amount
acetic acid potassium was used as catalyst, and the mixture was stirred
at 60°C for 24 h. After the reaction was complete, the mixture was
separated by centrifuging three times, and then dried in a vacuum
oven.”

Comment 14:Page 4 line 10, “The solid was washed three times
with hot water”, why was hot water used?
Response: Thank you very much for your comment. When the
crude products after reaction were post-processed, we considered the
feedstock may have the greater solubility in hot water than cold water
according to the common sense, and thus hot water was chose to wash
the crude product. Maybe cold water was also usable, which has not
been tried in this experiment.
Comment 15: The authors should characterize the dispersion of
the fillers in the composites by SEM or TEM.
Response: Thank you very much for your kindly suggestion.
According to your suggestion, the dispersion of the fillers in the
composites has been characterized using SEM and the results and
discussion have been added into the modified manuscript marked in
green. Here is an excerpt.
3.5. Dispersion state and compatibility of fillers
The dispersion state and compatibility of APP/OTCA@ZnO (Figure
10) and APP/HOTCA/ZnO (Figure 10) in EVA was investigated by
SEM. Comparing Figure 10 (a) and (c), it could be seen that
EVA/IFR-6 had plenty of small holes and bulges, apparently as a
result of poor compatibility of pristine nano-ZnO particles with the
matrix, while EVA containing OTCA@ZnO didn’t have this
appearence. The dispersion around APP was presented in Figure 10 (b)
and d and it could be observed that the compatibility between the char
forming agent and APP was not bad. From Figure 10 (d), it was worth
noting that a large amount of nano-zinc oxide was accumulated around
APP and the charring agent, and most of them existed in the form of
agglomerate. Such a distribution not only deteriorated the
compatibility of the fillers with the matrix, but also many nano-ZnO
were not sufficiently in contact with APP and the char-forming agent,
which resulted in a significant reduction of flame-retardant efficiency.
In contrast, the hybrid nano-zinc oxide was encapsulated by OTCA,
showing a better compatibility in the matrix and APP. In this way,
nano-zinc oxide together with the char forming agent could be more
uniformly dispersed in matrix, thereby improving the flame retardant
efficiency. This distribution also explained why the initial
decomposition temperature of EVA/IFR-3 was higher than that of
EVA/IFR-6.

and b) and EVA/IFR-6 (c and d).
