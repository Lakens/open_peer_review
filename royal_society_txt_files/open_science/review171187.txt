The only comment I have is associated with the presentation of the results of density estimates
from the software used. As far as the SECR analyses on leopard density estimation is concerned,
the authors must provide additional details on parameters estimated from both DENSITY and
SPACECAP. These include detection probability at activity centre and a range parameter, as
described in literature cited in this manuscript. This could be added as a supplementary
document. As multiple models were assessed using the Bayesian P values for the estimate using
SPACECAP, a table of model selection should also be reported with a z-score statistic used for
model diagnostic. These information are crucial for independent assessment when using these
classes of models.

This paper is well-written and interesting but requires consideration of a number of points
regarding interpretation. Please see my specific comments below.

Page8, Line54: This “98 day subset of the data” is all of the data anyway is it not? The 2 blocks
were surveyed 18 Feb-9 Apr, and 9Apr-3Jun. That is about 98 days. Why is it then a “subset” of
the data?
What was the size of the camera trap area? (polygon around camera locations). I don’t see this.
What was the size of the cam trap area in 2009? What is the difference in size?
Page9: The buffer width of 10 km was maintained following the previous 2009 study. But I
wonder if the buffer widths should be set according to data about animal movement during the
current study instead. Buffer widths are meant to establish the state space that includes all
animals that have any probability of being captured in the study area. It is not an arbitrary width
but rather is usually set according to movement data observed in the study. Setting the buffer the
same as a previous study assumes the animals have the same scale of movement as the previous
study. Is this reasonable? The scale of movement could have changed with changes in (a) leopard
density, (b) prey abundance and distribution, (c) disturbance, and—especially—(d) the
disappearance of tigers, since 2009. I believe to make the studies comparable, the buffer width
should have been chosen based on this study’s movement data. To take a buffer from a previous
study is actually to make the 2 studies less comparable. Did the authors consider buffer size in
accordance with their leopards movements, and whether it was appropriate to apply a buffer
from another time period? If, for example, their leopards in 2014 study had smaller home ranges
than in 2009, then the scale of movement is smaller, and perhaps the buffer should actually be
smaller than in 2009, not the same. Smaller buffer would raise their current density estimate,
possibly affecting conclusions about leopard decline.

SECR results. I think it would be useful to see more details. What was the detection probability
(g0)? scale of movement (sigma)? And, did these differ much from 2009?
Page 15, line 25-28. These consumptions rates (“7.3 muntjac/100 sqkm”)—are these for a period
of 180 days? Why was the period of 180 days chosen (in Methods)? Does this represent the dry
season period in which data were collected? Wasn’t the data collected over 2 years? If so what
period of time do these consumption rates pertain to?
Page 16: Regarding the reported decline in density. To be more certain about leopard population
decline, it would be interesting to compare numbers of leopards, in addition to density. What is
the estimated number of leopards (N-hat) in 2009 compared to now? I realize the study area was
expanded, but in the part that overlapped, how many leopards were there compared to 2009?
This is another way to look at trends in population over time. It would augment the density
estimate comparisons. Also, what about sex ratio between the 2 time periods? This would also be
interesting to compare. I am not talking about a statistical analysis, just discussion. Density
estimates alone are a very narrow window on what is happening over time in a given study site.
It is often more insightful to look at changes in abundance (numbers of animals, not density), sex
ratio (males perhaps being more susceptible to poaching), and demography. The conclusion of
density decline is a central part of this study, but I feel the question has been evaluated quite
narrowly.
Are encounters with leopard sign (foot prints, scrapes, and scats) also decreasing since 2009? The
researchers found 73 leopard scats in their study—this seems quite a lot to find in 2 years. I do
not know the sample area (please tell us; see above), but this is a high number for low density
leopard populations in SE Asia in such a time frame. My point is, leopard signs seem somewhat

and other places is that leopards here are not competing with tigers—they have all the prey to

But what about competition with dholes? Diets of leopard and dhole can also overlap a lot. And
dholes in packs are competitively dominant over leopard. Are dholes abundant there? Could low
dhole abundance be another factor facilitating leopard use of so much large ungulate prey?
Table 1. Freq of Occurrence (FO) does not sum to 100%. It seems these values are actually Percent
occurrence of items (PO), rather than FO (?). FO is the percent of scats in which a prey item occurs
(what is claimed in Methods). But this must sum to 100% (unless I am missing something or
mistaken). When all scats have just 1 prey type, PO = FO. In their case, many scats had > prey
item, so I suspect we are actually looking at PO values not FO. PO is the percent of all prey items
that is comprised of a particular prey type. A list of PO values can sum to > 100% when scats
have >1 prey item, as we see here. Note that in the literature, these terms are used confusingly,
and often incorrectly. But I don’t care about getting bogged down in semantics, just ask that the
authors clarify, and adjust their values and methods if necessary. I don’t know if this will require
going through the paper and changing current “FO” values and interpretations or not.

ar Prof. Padian:
ase consider for publication the attached paper, "An adaptable but threatened cat: density, diet, and prey
ection of the Indochinese leopard (Panthera pardus delacouri) in eastern Cambodia," by S. Rostro-García
l. We feel that we adequately addressed all the concerns of both reviewers.
e following is our detailed responses to comments by reviewers:
Reviewer #1:
e only comment I have is associated with the presentation of the results of density estimates from the
tware used. As far as the SECR analyses on leopard density estimation is concerned, the authors must
vide additional details on parameters estimated from both DENSITY and SPACECAP. These include
ection probability at activity centre and a range parameter, as described in literature cited in this
nuscript. This could be added as a supplementary document. As multiple models were assessed using the
yesian P values for the estimate using SPACECAP, a table of model selection should also be reported with
-score statistic used for model diagnostic. These information are crucial for independent assessment when
ng these classes of models.
added additional details on parameters estimated from both DENSITY and SPACECAP on the
plementary document as suggested by the reviewer. However, because several models were tested but
re not explained in detail in the manuscript, we decided to present those relevant to the paper instead of
assessed models to avoid confusion.
Reviewer #2:
s paper is well-written and interesting but requires consideration of a number of points regarding
erpretation. Please see my specific comments below.
ge8, Line54: This “98 day subset of the data” is all of the data anyway is it not? The 2 blocks were
veyed 18 Feb-9 Apr, and 9Apr-3Jun. That is about 98 days. Why is it then a “subset” of the data?
r cameras did extend for more than 98 days (total of 106 days). We chose 98 days because we deemed this
eriod that would not violate the assumptions of a closed population but would be long enough to obtain a
ger amount of data. Including the 8 extra days did not provided new data and instead increased the risk of
lating the closed population assumption.
at was the size of the camera trap area? (polygon around camera locations). I don’t see this.
at was the size of the cam trap area in 2009? What is the difference in size?
e camera trap area in 2009 was 210 km2. We extended the grid for another 60 km2 for a total of
roximately 270 km2. We added a sentence in the manuscript to clarify the difference in size of the camera
p areas.
ge9: The buffer width of 10 km was maintained following the previous 2009 study. But I wonder if the
fer widths should be set according to data about animal movement during the current study instead. Buffer
ths are meant to establish the state space that includes all animals that have any probability of being
tured in the study area. It is not an arbitrary width but rather is usually set according to movement data
erved in the study. Setting the buffer the same as a previous study assumes the animals have the same
le of movement as the previous study. Is this reasonable? The scale of movement could have changed with
nges in (a) leopard density, (b) prey abundance and distribution, (c) disturbance, and—especially—(d)
disappearance of tigers, since 2009. I believe to make the studies comparable, the buffer width should
e been chosen based on this study’s movement data. To take a buffer from a previous study is actually to
ke the 2 studies less comparable. Did the authors consider buffer size in accordance with their leopards
vements, and whether it was appropriate to apply a buffer from another time period? If, for example, their
pards in 2014 study had smaller home ranges than in 2009, then the scale of movement is smaller, and
haps the buffer should actually be smaller than in 2009, not the same. Smaller buffer would raise their
rent density estimate, possibly affecting conclusions about leopard decline.
e reviewer requested that we based the buffer on the animal movement data instead of using the 10 km
fer. The study conducted in 2009 did not base the buffer on the animal movement but rather used a
ndard 10 km buffer. Because we did not have access to the 2009 data, we were unable to reanalyze this
a using the animal movement. Consequently, to make the studies as comparable as possible, we kept the
km buffer for the density estimation using the maximum-likelihood estimator DENSITY. For the Bayesian
imator SPACECAP, a 15 km buffer was used, which was in accordance with the leopard movements, as
s larger than 3 times the detection function scale parameter, sigma. In addition, spatial capture-recapture
sity estimates are robust even with a fairly large number of transients during the sampling period (Royle
l., 2016). Nonetheless, to verify the density estimates obtained as suggested by the reviewer, we calculated
leopard density using a buffer size of 30 km in SPACECAP, and a buffer of 20 km and 30 km for
NSITY.
ey found 8 leopards—how many female, male?
identified 2 females, and 2 males. We were unable to determine the sex of 4 individuals. We added a
tence in the paper to clarify.
CR results. I think it would be useful to see more details. What was the detection probability (g0)? scale
movement (sigma)? And, did these differ much from 2009?
included more details about the detection probability and scale of movement in the supplementary
terial. The study conducted in 2009 did not provide an overall detection probability and sigma so we were
ble to directly compare between studies.
ge 15, line 25-28. These consumptions rates (“7.3 muntjac/100 sqkm”)—are these for a period of 180
s? Why was the period of 180 days chosen (in Methods)? Does this represent the dry season period in
ich data were collected? Wasn’t the data collected over 2 years? If so what period of time do these
sumption rates pertain to?
s, the consumption rates were calculated for a period covering 180 days, which represented the dry season.
ts were only collected during the dry season, thus our consumption rates could only be calculated for this
iod. Data were collected from two consecutive dry seasons, and data were pooled across years. We
luded a new sentence in Methods to clarify this point.
ge 16: Regarding the reported decline in density. To be more certain about leopard population decline, it
uld be interesting to compare numbers of leopards, in addition to density. What is the estimated number
leopards (N-hat) in 2009 compared to now? I realize the study area was expanded, but in the part that
rlapped, how many leopards were there compared to 2009? This is another way to look at trends in
pulation over time. It would augment the density estimate comparisons. Also, what about sex ratio between
2 time periods? This would also be interesting to compare. I am not talking about a statistical analysis,
t discussion. Density estimates alone are a very narrow window on what is happening over time in a given
dy site. It is often more insightful to look at changes in abundance (numbers of animals, not density), sex
io (males perhaps being more susceptible to poaching), and demography. The conclusion of density
line is a central part of this study, but I feel the question has been evaluated quite narrowly.
e reviewer suggested that we compare the sex ratio between study periods. However, this was not possible
ause we were unable to determine the sex of 50% of the leopards that were photographed. The 2009 study
imated leopard population size (N) based on closed population models implemented in software
PTURE and MARK. Using CAPTURE, for example, the 2009 study obtained a population estimate of
individuals (SE 4.1), whereas we found a population estimate of 8.2 individuals (SE 2.7). However, we
l these values are inadequate given the way they were estimated (i.e., using non-spatial capture-recapture).
non-spatial models, the parameter N is functionally unrelated to any notion of sample area, and are not
egrated with any ecological theory, resulting in values of N that are not connected to the specific landscape
any explicit way. Density, on the other hand, was estimated using N standardized by the area of the state-
ce (i.e., using spatially explicit capture-recapture models), making it less sensitive, and thus directly
mparable between studies. Therefore, we chose to compare density between studies instead of population
e.
encounters with leopard sign (foot prints, scrapes, and scats) also decreasing since 2009? The
earchers found 73 leopard scats in their study—this seems quite a lot to find in 2 years. I do not know the
mple area (please tell us; see above), but this is a high number for low density leopard populations in SE
a in such a time frame. My point is, leopard signs seem somewhat abundant. Has sign encounter rates
lined since 2009?
opard sign was not recorded in 2009, therefore we were unable to compare between studies.
ge 20, line 25-32. Another big reason for differences in prey consumption between this study and other
ces is that leopards here are not competing with tigers—they have all the prey to themselves (I see further
wn they address this—good job). But what about competition with dholes? Diets of leopard and dhole can
o overlap a lot. And dholes in packs are competitively dominant over leopard. Are dholes abundant there?
uld low dhole abundance be another factor facilitating leopard use of so much large ungulate prey?
ring the study period, the dhole population was low. Leopard and dhole potentially competed for food
ources, thus low numbers of dhole might have facilitated predation of larger prey by leopard. However,
assumed the dhole population was unlikely to significantly affect the leopard diet and prey selection due
he low numbers of dhole on our study site. We included a new paragraph and reference in the Discussion
address this point.
ble 1. Freq of Occurrence (FO) does not sum to 100%. It seems these values are actually Percent
urrence of items (PO), rather than FO (?). FO is the percent of scats in which a prey item occurs (what
laimed in Methods). But this must sum to 100% (unless I am missing something or mistaken). When all
ts have just 1 prey type, PO = FO. In their case, many scats had > prey item, so I suspect we are actually
king at PO values not FO. PO is the percent of all prey items that is comprised of a particular prey type.
ist of PO values can sum to > 100% when scats have >1 prey item, as we see here. Note that in the
rature, these terms are used confusingly, and often incorrectly. But I don’t care about getting bogged
wn in semantics, just ask that the authors clarify, and adjust their values and methods if necessary. I don’t
w if this will require going through the paper and changing current “FO” values and interpretations or
.
e reviewer is correct in that Freq of Occurrence (FO) does not sum to 100%. This is because FO is based
the % of scats containing a particular food item. Therefore, if multiple prey items were found in scats, as
his study, the FO will sum >100%. That said, FO is one of the most commonly used methods to describe
pard and other carnivore diets, and we stated in Methods that we included FO for comparison purposes
y. Percent Occurrence (PO), on the other hand, does equal to 100% because it’s based on the % of a
ticular prey item compared to all prey items, and we agree that these terms are often confused in the
rature. To avoid confusion, we included a reference in the Methods (after we mention FO) that clearly
ines the different methods for scat analysis, such as FO and PO.
