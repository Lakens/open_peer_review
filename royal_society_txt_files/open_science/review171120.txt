Overall, this is a clear, concise, and well-written manuscript. The introduction is relevant and
theory based. Sufficient information about the previous study findings is presented for readers to
follow the present study rationale and procedures. The methods are generally appropriate.
Overall, the results are clear and compelling and the authors make a systematic contribution to
the research literature in this area of investigation. The longitudinal nature of the work is a
welcome addition. Overall, this is a high quality work, however, the relevance and significance of
the study to the existing knowledge is certain.
Please find attached my comments, on the manuscript entitled “Remote sensing appraisal of Lake
Chad shrinkage connotes severe impacts on green economics and socio-economics of the
