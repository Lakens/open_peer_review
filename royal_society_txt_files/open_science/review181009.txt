Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript describes observational studies of chacma baboons that find interesting
differences in sexual behavior depending upon the female/male composition of baboons in the
immediate social environment. There is a lot to like in this manuscript – it is a strong naturalistic
observational study, the findings related to female composition of the social environment seem
novel, the writing of the manuscript itself is clear and concise – I do have a number of comments
about the work.
For starters, it seems as though the findings related to male composition of the social
environment are expected and are in line with findings from other species, but that the findings
related to female composition of the social environment are fairly novel. If I am correct in this
interpretation, I wonder if the authors could play up this unique aspect of the work a bit more in
the discussion and maybe in an extra line or two in the abstract.
It may be widely used in this context in the primate literature, but “audience” and “audience
effect” have pretty distinct meanings in animal communication – when a signaler’s signal use
3
varies depending upon the nature of the receivers in the immediate social environment. Such
audience effects are one type of social influence on behavior typically referred to as social
facilitation (the “audience” makes certain behavior more likely) or social inhibition (the
“audience” makes certain behavior less likely to be performed). The author might wish to
consider using the terms social facilitation / inhibition instead of audience effects?
In lines 46-51, the authors raise a number of predictions regarding their study. I suggest they use
the word “expect” in place of “predict” here, given the lack of explicit hypotheses being raised.
Even better, though, I think the manuscript would be strengthened considerably if the authors
could raise two or more explicit hypotheses from the literature that could be tested by their data
set, and then lay out the specific predictions of each hypothesis here in this concluding paragraph
of the Introduction. The ultimate goal in the study would then be to determine if the findings rule
out at least one of those hypotheses.
In lines 60-67 the authors should ideally indicate that data were coded blind with regard to
hypotheses being tested / classes of animal (e.g., females with or without female composition in
immediate social environment) and/or report what their inter-rater agreement was in the data
coding described here.
Minor comments by line number:
26. I suggest the authors replace “. . . to reduce their . . .” with “. . . in ways that reduce those
females’ . . .” to avoid the possible implication that dominant females do this behavior
intentionally.
43-45. I do not know if there is another way to write this, but this sentence made me think that,
after reading the authors’ abstract, the authors already knew what the outcome of their study
would be. Perhaps in this paragraph the authors could build up in a sentence or two how their
new study differs from / adds to what we already knew about social influences on sexual
behavior in chacma baboons?
49. By ‘mate-guarding status’ do the authors mean the status of the male doing the mate
guarding?
80 and elsewhere. Unless “baseline” is frequently used in this way in this literature, I would
suggest the authors use “non-copulation scans” here. When I read “baseline” I typically think of
non-experimental stimulus conditions in an experimental study.
105-108. I appreciate the difficulty of obtaining these data from wild animals, and appreciate the
arguments against a strict interpretation of “significance only when p <=0.05”, but a p = 0.093
seems questionable to interpret as being a significant finding here.
117. this is a reference to the males doing the mate guarding, correct?
139-154. Following from a point raised above, this paragraph seems to discuss the key *new*
information this study contributes to the literature. I wonder if it might be worth expanding on
the importance / implications of this in a paragraph to follow this one, assuming the authors are
not up against tight word limit constraints.
156. The phrase “where females inhibit sexual behavior” suggests females have voluntary control
over the behavior. This may be true, but if this is not what the authors mean (or what studies
have shown) perhaps the authors could write something like “where sexual behavior in females
is inhibited” here?

label_comment_3
The authors have done a really good job of addressing comments of the earlier reviews, and the
manuscript is stronger for it. I only have a small number of relatively minor suggestions - mostly
stylistic. It was a pleasure to review both versions of this really strong study!
I still question the use of “audience effects” here given the centrality of animal communication to
that term. Why not simply use “social influence”, if “facilitation” or “inhibition” are too
directional for the nature of the questions asked here? Alternatively, perhaps state in a sentence
that follows lines 62-64 that the authors are aware they are defining audience effects here more
broadly than is typically considered (and perhaps cite the short Zuberbühler (2008) review of
audience effects in Current Biology)?
In line 85, the authors use the word “friend” – I realize this is becoming more commonplace in
non-human primate literature, but I wonder if it is the most appropriate word here, given its
connection to the male mating partner of the female. Does “friend” really capture the nature of
that relationship?
Line 187 has a reference to “baseline”
In line 240, I suggest replacing “is likely to reflect” with “reflects”, since the earlier use of
“suggesting” already implies a likelihood rather than a certainty
In line 248, you could delete the “may” for the same reason related to the use of “suggest”
In line 253 you can delete the comma after “Although”
In line 275, you could delete the “may” for the same “suggest” reason
9
In line 280, you could replace “may not be” with “is not” for the same “suggest” reason
In line 304, it is not immediately clear what the “it” refers to – it might make it easier for a reader
to specify this

Review: Adult male and female bystanders inhibit matings of oestrous females in wild
chacma baboons
This article provides an interesting perspective on audience effects during mating behavior
of wild chacma baboons, with a focus on female initiated matings. As chacma baboons are a
promiscuous species, matings of females are constrained by the behavior of both male and
emale groupmates. This study provides support for the hypothesis that especially in the
presence of male baboons matings initiated by females are less frequent. Until now, most of
he studies studying audience effects on matings in primates were focused on copulation
calls, this study therefore contributes a new perspective on the importance of considering
audience effects on different aspects of primate behavior.
The results are clearly presented, I have a few remarks and questions especially about the
methodology and results.
hope the authors find my comments useful and constructive.
Suggestion for an additional analysis:
was wondering if the discussion of the most important finding of the study, that female
matings are also influenced by the female audience and depend additionally on the mate
guarding status, could lead to an interesting additional analysis. The authors suggested that
emales would be attacked/harassed by other females and therefore would decrease their
mating behavior. If this is true, the rank of female bystanders should be of high importance
o the female that is initiating the mating. Could it be possible that only higher-ranking
bystanders (relative to the focal female) are really a threat to the female exhibiting sexual
activity? As the authors state in l. 73 the identity of the adult bystanders has been recorded
and therefore they would probably also have knowledge about the ranks of the bystanders.
f that is the case it would be interesting to run the model with the fixed factor: “number of
emale bystanders that outrank the focal female”. If the results are the same this would
validate the interpretation that females are trying to escape harassment of other females
hat witnessed their mating behavior.
Comments concerning the introduction:
n the introduction the authors make a strong point for the importance ofto considering the
effects of male and female audiences on matings. It could be beneficial to establish different
predictions for the influence both sexes on matings especially because the model presented
n table 1 shows the presence of males compared to females is more important to the
occurrence of matings.
Comments concerning the methods:
First a very general question: I wonder if using audience scans directly after the copulation is
a valid way to infer the influence of the audience on mating behavior. It would be useful to
have more information about the changes in composition of the audience relative to
requency and duration of matings, and if it was possible that the audience before and after
a copulation changed. If so, it would be problematic to use only audience scans after the
copulation.
The method section is rather short, for me it would have been helpful to have some more
general information about the data collection, i. e. the average total number of daily
observation time, or during which hours of the day the animals were followed, how the focal
animals were chosen.
The paper cited in l. 60 used a 10-point absolute scale to score the swelling size of females.
How does the scoring in this study differ from the scoring used by Gesquiere et al. 2007?
Even though mate guarding is widely known and prevalent in many studies it would be
helpful to have a more extensive definition of this behavior in the method section, as it is
central to the analysis. Was the mate guarding only defined by the exclusivity of the mating
behavior btw. the mate guard and the focal female and not by distance from the female?
Can the mate guarding status change during a day? (This would only matter if focal
ndividuals would be followed more than once per day.) How exactly was the data on the
mate guarding status of the females collected? I was wondering if the mate guarding male
was considered as audience if a mating occurred in his presence? Is it possible that mate-
guarded females-initiated copulations with other males than the mate-guard (l. 62-63 states
hat the mate guard exclusively mates with the female but is the female still able to mate
with other males)?
t would additionally be interesting to know if the presence of the mate guard had an
nfluence on the audience during the baseline scans of females. This could give additional
upport for the hypothesis stating that females are benefitting from protection of the mate-
guards.
. 72-73: I was wondering about the visibility of the audience. Was an individual only
considered as audience if the view to the focal individual was unobstructed? This could be
especially important for the mating context.
n the last paragraph of the section on statistical analysis (l. 95ff.) you explain the reason for
calculating the model from table 1 with the response variable “male initiated copulations”.
For these control models with the male-initiated copulations the authors state they used the
baseline scans recorded during female observations. I do not understand why not baseline
cans from male observations were used.
n the same paragraph the authors explain that audience effects during female-initiated
copulations could result from active strategies of females but also just from general patterns
affecting all copulations. This is very interesting but the “general patterns affecting all
copulations” are not further discussed. Is there a difference between the average number of
bystanders for male vs. female-initiated copulations? Even if all copulations are peripheral if
not a special property of the habitat of the baboons would prevent them from mating in the
center of the group then it would still be a decision (from males or females) to choose a
peripheral location for the mating.
Comments concerning the results:
For the results some general descriptive statistics about the ranges and mean number of
bystanders would be useful. How many female initiated/male initiated copulations occurred
with 0/>1 male/female bystanders.
.107-111: for the female-initiated copulations you reported the model comparison (with
and without the interaction term for male bystanders and mate-guarding), but for the
nteraction term female bystanders*mate-guarding you did not report it.
noticed that no model with the total number of bystanders was reported. I understand that
one central idea of the paper was to differentiate btw. effects of male and female
bystanders. But it would still be interesting to see if the model including only the total
number of bystanders is worse compared to the one including separate numbers for male
and female bystanders. I would expect a combined audience of male and female individuals
o have the strongest “inhibiting” effect on female initiated matings because in this situation
he individual mating would provoke male and female aggression.
. 231 as well as response variable in table 1, l. 32 (supplementary) and response variable
Table S3:
n your models and in the lines stated above you name your response variable the
probability of female-initiated copulations. For me the term “probability” suggests, that you
calculated the probability that a female or male initiated a copulation e.g. based on the total
amount of copulations occurring in a day for a specific individual. But if I understood you
correctly this was not how the data was collected and used in the model: the 1/0
“probability” only signifies which scan type occurred (as described in l.82-83). I think the
esponse variable could be called occurrence of male(female)-initiated copulation. In the
caption of the table and e. g. also in l. 83 the authors could specify that the variable was
used as a binary 0/1 variable 0 for baseline scans and 1 for copulation scans.
n all the models you report “year” is a significant fixed effect that has a rather big estimate.
This result is not discussed. I wonder if you have any hypothesis concerning the reason for
his effect?
Lastly, I was wondering about the ranks of the male bystanders. I am not sure if male
dominance ranks were also established for the population during this study but if they were,
he following question would be interesting to answer: Do the ranks of the male bystanders
vary when comparing male and female initiated matings? Are lowerranking males more
present during female-initiated copulations?
Comments concerning the discussion:
Considering the importance of the audience to the initiator of the mating it would be very
nteresting to have a measure of the social monitoring towards the audience. I wonder if this
tudy was part of a standardized data collection protocol where information about this
behavior could have been collected. Perhaps this idea could be discussed in the context of
he proximate mechanisms underlying the audience effects.
Comments concerning the supplementary material:
You report that you tested the significance of the fixed factors by using a LRT (l. 66-67) and
also by computing the Wald confidence intervals (l. 71-73). What was the reason for this
procedure?
n Appendix 2 you tested for multicollinearity btw. number of female and male bystanders
but not between mate guarding status and the number of bystanders (l73-78). Why?
Minor comments:

ixed effects that are not included in an interaction term.

Appendix B
Response to referees
We would like to thank the Editor and the two Reviewers for their careful
reading of our manuscript and their very useful suggestions. Our point-by-point
responses are presented below, in bold and blue characters.
Associate Editor's comments (Dr Alexander Ophir):
I have now received the feedback from two expert reviewers. I agree with the
assessment of both reviewers that there is much to like about this manuscript, but that
it could also be improved. The reviewers provide a number of very constructive
comments that you should address. These range from enhancing your discussion of
the novel findings (and the suggestion of additional analyses to strength this), being
more accurate with the language you use, providing more details about the methods
(etc) and several other suggestions that could improve your manuscript. I encourage
you to review and address these comments.
We have carefully addressed the comments of the Reviewers. In particular, we
have now run the new analysis asked by Reviewer 1 that investigates whether
the number of higher-ranking female bystanders (instead of the total number of
adult female bystanders) inhibits the copulations of oestrous females (see
description of new model L171-187). Our result of sexual inhibition by female
bystanders does not hold anymore in this new model (see results L219-232 and
Table 2). Instead, we found that mate-guarded females initiated more
copulations in presence of higher ranking females. We have entirely rewritten
the discussion about female audience in discussion (L280-307). We are now
emphasized more clearly the originality of our manuscript in introduction (L63-
72 and L88-95) and discuss further the male inhibiting effect, which could
represent a form of indirect sexual coercion (L251-266 & 322-333). In addition,
we have provided more details in the methods and have changed some terms
as suggested by the reviewers, where appropriate.
Reviewer 1:
This article provides an interesting perspective on audience effects during mating
behavior of wild chacma baboons, with a focus on female initiated matings. As
chacma baboons are a promiscuous species, matings of females are constrained by
the behavior of both male and female groupmates. This study provides support for the
hypothesis that especially in the presence of male baboons matings initiated by
females are less frequent. Until now, most of the studies studying audience effects on
matings in primates were focused on copulation calls, this study therefore contributes
a new perspective on the importance of considering audience effects on different
aspects of primate behavior. The results are clearly presented, I have a few remarks
and questions especially about the methodology and results. I hope the authors find
my comments useful and constructive.
Suggestion for an additional analysis:
I was wondering if the discussion of the most important finding of the study, that
female matings are also influenced by the female audience and depend additionally
on the mate guarding status, could lead to an interesting additional analysis. The
authors suggested that females would be attacked/harassed by other females and
therefore would decrease their mating behavior. If this is true, the rank of female
bystanders should be of high importance to the female that is initiating the mating.
Could it be possible that only higher-ranking bystanders (relative to the focal female)
are really a threat to the female exhibiting sexual activity? As the authors state in l. 73
the identity of the adult bystanders has been recorded and therefore they would
probably also have knowledge about the ranks of the bystanders. If that is the case it
would be interesting to run the model with the fixed factor: “number of
female bystanders that outrank the focal female”. If the results are the same this
would validate the interpretation that females are trying to escape harassment of
other females that witnessed their mating behavior.
Thank you for this relevant suggestion. Indeed if the inhibiting effect of female
bystanders is due mainly to female-female competition, we expect that the
result will hold when fitting the number of higher-ranking female bystanders
(instead of the total number of adult females). We re-run the model by using the
number of adult females within 5m that outrank the focal female (see new
model description L171-187). As mentioned above, we found no inhibiting effect
of the number of higher ranking females on unguarded females. Instead, we
found that mate-guarded females are more likely to initiate copulation in
presence of higher-ranking females (see new Tables 2 and S2 and results L219-
232). We are now discussing this new result extensively (L280-307).
Comments concerning the introduction:
In the introduction the authors make a strong point for the importance to considering
the effects of male and female audiences on matings. It could be beneficial to
establish different predictions for the influence both sexes on matings especially
because the model presented in table 1 shows the presence of males compared to
females is more important to the occurrence of matings.
We except that male bystanders would be more efficient at inhibiting
copulations than female bystanders given (1) the importance of the sexual
dimorphism in this species (and thus the asymmetry power between the sexes
during aggression) and (2) the fact that they often attack and injure oestrous
females in the context of sexual coercion (see Baniel et al. 2017). We have now
added this prediction at the end of the introduction: "We further hypothesize
(H3) that male bystanders would inhibit sexual behaviour of oestrous females
more strongly than female bystanders given the importance of sexual
dimorphism in this species, where male aggression is the main source of injury
for oestrous females" (L99-102) and are now clearly concluding that male
inhibition is stronger than female inhibition (L271-275).
Comments concerning the methods:
First a very general question: I wonder if using audience scans directly after the
copulation is a valid way to infer the influence of the audience on mating behavior. It
would be useful to have more information about the changes in composition of the
audience relative to frequency and duration of matings, and if it was possible that the
audience before and after a copulation changed. If so, it would be problematic to use
only audience scans after the copulation.
Actually the data from copulation scans were entered immediately after
copulations (i.e. within 30 seconds) but recorded the social context during
copulation. We say ‘after copulation’ to account for the fact that we need time
to enter basic data on the copulation event such as the identity of sexual
partners before the scans are entered, too. Audience scans were recorded
frequently in baseline (i.e. every 5min) during focal observations, leading the
observer to monitor constantly the adult individuals around the focal individual
(in order to fill the next scan). Thus, we are confident that the copulation scans
reflect accurately who was in the 5m during the copulation. We have clarified
that copulation scans were entered within 30 seconds after the copulation and
recorded the social context during the copulation in the main text (L148-151).
The method section is rather short, for me it would have been helpful to have some
more general information about the data collection, i. e. the average total number of
daily observation time, or during which hours of the day the animals were followed,
how the focal animals were chosen.
We were following both study groups daily from 6am to 6pm. Focal individuals
were chosen in a semi-random manner, in order to balance observations
equally across individuals and time periods. We are now providing such
information L134-140.
The paper cited in l. 60 used a 10-point absolute scale to score the swelling size of
females. How does the scoring in this study differ from the scoring used by Gesquiere
et al. 2007?
We used a slightly different scoring scale than Gesquiere et al 2007 to assess
the size of sexual swellings: our scale goes from 1 to 4 by increments of 0.5 (i.e.
7-point scale) while Gesquiere et al 2007 have a 10-point scale. This 7-point
scale system has been implemented for a long time at our field site and
efficiently captures variations in swelling size. However, the principle remains
the same: trained observers scored the swelling size using a visual estimate of
the swelling volume. We have reworded as follow: "Trained observers recorded
the swelling size of females daily through a visual assessment [29], using a 7-
point scale scoring system." (L126-127)
Even though mate guarding is widely known and prevalent in many studies it would
be helpful to have a more extensive definition of this behavior in the method section,
as it is central to the analysis. Was the mate guarding only defined by the exclusivity
of the mating behavior btw. the mate guard and the focal female and not by distance
from the female? Can the mate guarding status change during a day? (This would
only matter if focal individuals would be followed more than once per day.) How
exactly was the data on the mate guarding status of the females collected? I was
wondering if the mate guarding male was considered as audience if a mating
occurred in his presence? Is it possible that mateguarded females-initiated
copulations with other males than the mate-guard (l. 62-63 states
that the mate guard exclusively mates with the female but is the female still able to
mate with other males)?
Mate-guarding episodes were defined both by the exclusivity of matings
between the male and the oestrous female and by the close spatial proximity
between them (with males following females around constantly). These two
criteria now appear in our operational definition "Mate guarding episodes (or
‘consortships’) were defined as periods when oestrous females are constantly
followed by a male who mates exclusively with them " (L128-129). Changes in
mate-guarding patterns were monitored ad libitum (this behaviour is obvious
and unmistakable in chacma baboons) and the mate-guarding status of focal
individuals was also recorded at the start of each focal observation. For the
analysis, we used the record of mate-guarding associated to the focal
observation for a greater accuracy. This has been made clear in the methods
L129-133. Guarded females rarely (almost never) copulate with another male
than their consort: we recorded 2 cases out of 397 copulations. These 2 cases
were removed from the dataset so that the category "mate-guarded females" is
homogenous and only includes cases where females copulate with their
consort. We have added L175-178 that mate guarded female only copulate with
their male consort in our analyses.
It would additionally be interesting to know if the presence of the mate guard had an
influence on the audience during the baseline scans of females. This could give
additional support for the hypothesis stating that females are benefitting from
protection of the mateguards.
Oestrous females had an equal number of higher-ranking females within 5m in
baseline observations when unguarded (mean no. of female bystanders±SD =
0.21±0.31) than when mate-guarded (0.13±0.18, t-test: t=1.17, df= 48.70,
p=0.246). However, oestrous females had more adult males within 5m in
baseline when unguarded (mean no. of male bystanders±SD = 0.33±0.14) than
when mate-guarded (0.02±0.03, t-test: t = 11.73, df = 33.21, p<0.001). This last
result makes sense because the male consort has been excluded from the
baseline audience count of mate-guarded females (cf explanation L155-158).
The raw data of audience composition of unguarded and mate-guarded females
have now been added in Table 1. In addition, we refer to the similar female
audience of unguarded and mate-guarded females L228-233.
l. 72-73: I was wondering about the visibility of the audience. Was an individual only
considered as audience if the view to the focal individual was unobstructed? This
could be especially important for the mating context.
No, we collected all individuals within 5m of the focal female, whether they were
in sight or not (i.e. even if they were obstructed from the view of the
copulation). This has been clarified L152-153. This is because (1) it’s hard to
know who is visible and who is not from the focal perspective, (2) copulations
are very conspicuous (with copulation call and darting behaviour) and
neighbours would know who is copulating anyway, even if they do not see the
copulation, and (3) it is also quite likely that the mating pair is (generally) aware
of who is within 5m of them, even if they are not in sight (e.g. because of
interactions in the previous minutes).
In the last paragraph of the section on statistical analysis (l. 95ff.) you explain the
reason for calculating the model from table 1 with the response variable “male
initiated copulations”. For these control models with the male-initiated copulations the
authors state they used the baseline scans recorded during female observations. I do
not understand why not baseline scans from male observations were used.
In this control model, we do not aim to study audience effects on male
copulatory behaviour (which would indeed require to compare audience
compositions during male-initiated copulations versus during baseline scans of
male observations), as the focus of this ms is female copulatory behaviour.
Instead we aim to test if copulations have some inherent properties that imply
that the mating individuals have less neighbours around them. For this we need
to compare female-initiated copulations and male-initiated copulations to the
same baseline (in this case female baseline scans). Finding that female and
male bystanders inhibit both female-initiated and male-initiated copulations
would suggest either (1) that both females and males are inhibited in front of
male and female bystanders OR (2) that copulations occur in the group
periphery, and are characterised by less neighbours than baseline
observations. Since we found that male-initiated copulations are not inhibited
by female bystanders, these two scenarios are unlikely, suggesting that our
results may rather reflect active female strategies. We now introduced the
rationale behind the control model in the introduction (L107-113) and conclude
about female active strategies in the results (L239-243).
In the same paragraph the authors explain that audience effects during female-
initiated copulations could result from active strategies of females but also just from
general patterns affecting all copulations. This is very interesting but the “general
patterns affecting all copulations” are not further discussed. Is there a difference
between the average number of bystanders for male vs. female-initiated copulations?
Even if all copulations are peripheral if not a special property of the habitat of the
baboons would prevent them from mating in the center of the group then it would still
be a decision (from males or females) to choose a peripheral location for the mating.
Please see our previous response. The number of female bystanders is similar
for female-initiated (mean±SD: 0.11±0.16) and male-initiated copulations
(0.08±0.13, t = 0.69, df = 45.14, p = 0.491), but there are less male bystanders
during female-initiated (0.01±0.03) than male-initiated (0.09±0.22, t = -2.04, df =
30.54, p = 0.050) copulations, suggesting that the effect male bystanders (1) is
stronger on female-initiated copulations than male-initiated copulations and (2)
is partly the result of an active female avoidance rather than reflecting a general
property of copulations. The descriptive statistics have been added in Table 1
and the difference in audience composition between female- and male-initiated
copulations are now discussed L243-248.
Comments concerning the results:
For the results some general descriptive statistics about the ranges and mean
number of bystanders would be useful. How many female initiated/male initiated
copulations occurred with 0/>1 male/female bystanders.
We have now added a table containing the required descriptive statistics (see
new Table 1) and mention it L159-160.
l.107-111: for the female-initiated copulations you reported the model comparison
(with and without the interaction term for male bystanders and mate-guarding), but for
the interaction term female bystanders*mate-guarding you did not report it.
We did not report it in the previous version because the estimate and
significance of the interaction were indicated in former Table 1 (we only
retained significant interactions in our final models, which is why the
interaction term male bystanders*mate-guarding did not figure in the former
Table 1). We have now reported the results of the model comparison with and
without these two interaction terms in the main text so it is symmetrical for
male and female bystanders (see L221-222).
I noticed that no model with the total number of bystanders was reported. I
understand that one central idea of the paper was to differentiate btw. effects of male
and female bystanders. But it would still be interesting to see if the model including
only the total number of bystanders is worse compared to the one including separate
numbers for male and female bystanders. I would expect a combined audience of
male and female individuals to have the strongest “inhibiting” effect on female initiated
matings because in this situation the individual mating would provoke male and
female aggression.
We have now run the model proposed where the number of male and higher
ranking female bystanders are added into a single fixed effect. Please see
results in Table A below. We find similar results than in the manuscript: females
are less likely to initiate copulations in presence of a high number of
bystanders, but there is a significant interaction between mate-guarding status
and the number of bystanders (i.e. mate-guarded females are less affected by
the presence of bystanders than unguarded females). However, when we
compare this pooled model and the one with separate fixed effects for male and
female bystanders, using an anova test, we find that the one with separate
effects of male and female bystanders is better ( =15.22, df=1, p<0.001). In
addition, the pooled model provides less information than the alternative model
in the context of our hypotheses since the number of adult bystanders does not
say anything on the gender composition of the audience: a number of 3
bystanders may mean 3 males, 3 females, 2 females and 1 male, or 2 males and
1 female – and this potential variation will influence the strength of the
inhibiting effect. So we prefer to keep the model with separate estimates in the
main text.

l. 231 as well as response variable in table 1, l. 32 (supplementary) and response
variable in Table S3:
In your models and in the lines stated above you name your response variable the
probability of female-initiated copulations. For me the term “probability” suggests, that
you calculated the probability that a female or male initiated a copulation e.g. based
on the total amount of copulations occurring in a day for a specific individual. But if I
understood you correctly this was not how the data was collected and used in the
model: the 1/0 “probability” only signifies which scan type occurred (as described in
l.82-83). I think the response variable could be called occurrence of male(female)-
initiated copulation.
We have replaced "probability" by "occurrence" in all the Tables and Table
captions (see Table 2, S2, S3).
In the caption of the table and e. g. also in l. 83 the authors could specify that the
variable was used as a binary 0/1 variable 0 for baseline scans and 1 for copulation
scans.
We have changed as suggested L166, 174 and 195.
In all the models you report “year” is a significant fixed effect that has a rather big
estimate. This result is not discussed. I wonder if you have any hypothesis concerning
the reason for this effect?
We did not discuss this effect because "Year" was added in the model as a
control variable, in order to control for differences between 2013 and 2014 in
e.g. variation in the number of oestrous females and copulations, number of
males, social dynamics, etc. This is now mentioned L186-187. The fixed effect
"year" across the different models just indicates that more copulations
occurred in 2014.
Lastly, I was wondering about the ranks of the male bystanders. I am not sure if male
dominance ranks were also established for the population during this study but if they
were, the following question would be interesting to answer: Do the ranks of the male
bystanders vary when comparing male and female initiated matings? Are lower-
ranking males more present during female-initiated copulations?
We only have 3 cases where an adult male was present within 5m during
female-initiated copulations (and 24 cases for male-initiated copulations, see
Table 1). The rank of male bystanders is 0.80±0.29 (mean±SD, on a scale from 0
to 1) during female-initiated copulations and 0.52±0.27 during male-initiated
copulations. We prefer to avoid proposing a prediction on the rank of male
bystanders because it is hard to predict female reactions: all adult males
outrank all adult females, so that a female may be inhibited by any adult male,
and it is unclear whether the rank of her male mating partner could also affect
her reaction to the male audience. So all in all, considering our small sample
size and the lack of clarity of the associated hypothesis, we opted to leave this
test out.
Comments concerning the discussion:
Considering the importance of the audience to the initiator of the mating it would be
very interesting to have a measure of the social monitoring towards the audience. I
wonder if this study was part of a standardized data collection protocol where
information about this behavior could have been collected. Perhaps this idea could be
discussed in the context of the proximate mechanisms underlying the audience
effects.
We did not collect data on how the focal female may monitor who is around her.
However, given the strict dominance hierarchy among individuals and the
frequency of displacements, supplants and attacks by higher ranking
individuals in chacma baboons, individuals most likely monitor permanently
who they have around (especially on such a short distance of 5m). For example,
individuals give frequent eye glances around them when feeding, especially
when hearing a movement, and also seem to use their side vision a lot (it is
frequent to see an individual being supplanted without even giving a look at the
dominant individual approaching). We added a sentence in the discussion
regarding the potential proximate mechanisms mediating these audience
effects (L312-314).
Comments concerning the supplementary material:
You report that you tested the significance of the fixed factors by using a LRT (l. 66-
67) and also by computing the Wald confidence intervals (l. 71-73). What was the
reason for this procedure?
It is usually recommended to avoid reporting the z-values and p-values that are
given by default in the model summary of the R package ‘lme4’. Instead, it is
recommended to use a LRT to estimate the significance of fixed factors, thanks
to the function drop1 (model, test="Chisq"). We also reported confidence
intervals of estimates, to improve the description of the effect size associated
to a given variable. The Wald method is a common method to estimate
confidence intervals of estimates in GLMMs, using the confint.merMod
(method="Wald") command in the R package ‘lme4’.
In Appendix 2 you tested for multicollinearity btw. number of female and male
bystanders but not between mate guarding status and the number of bystanders (l73-
78). Why?
We tested for multicollinearity among all fixed effects (see L207-208). We
provided in addition the correlation coefficient between the number of higher
ranking female and male bystanders within scans to show that we have the
statistical power to differentiate between these effects.
Minor comments:
Table 1, Table S3: Perhaps add to the caption that the LRT, df and p-values are only
given for fixed effects that are not included in an interaction term.
This has been added in the legend caption of Table 2 (former Table 1, see L464)
and Table 3 (former Table S3, see L471).
l. 241 & Figure S1, l. 41: The c in “copulation scans” is capitalized.
This typo has been corrected.
Figure 1 (a) & (b): it would be helpful to state “female initiated copulation” in the axis
labeling as well.
We have changed the title of the x axis (see new Figure 1).
l.195: eliminate the character spacing between “distance” and the comma
Done (L371).
l. 220: add a character spacing between comma and “Macaca fuscata”
Done (L444).
l. 225-226: the journal is not stated for this reference.
This article is now published and the corresponding reference has been
updated (L401-402).
Table S1: It could be helpful to include the total number of individuals for each group
to have a quicker overview of the overall group size.
Done

We have changed the title of the x axis (see new Figure 2, former Figure S1).
l. 77 (supplementary material): Are proximity scans the same as the audience scans
after the matings?
Sorry this was a typo. We replaced "proximity scans" by "audience scans"
(L212, now in main text) to use a consistent terminology.
Reviewer 2:
This manuscript describes observational studies of chacma baboons that find
interesting differences in sexual behavior depending upon the female/male
composition of baboons in the immediate social environment. There is a lot to like in
this manuscript – it is a strong naturalistic observational study, the findings related to
female composition of the social environment seem novel, the writing of the
manuscript itself is clear and concise – I do have a number of comments about the
work.
For starters, it seems as though the findings related to male composition of the social
environment are expected and are in line with findings from other species, but that the
findings related to female composition of the social environment are fairly novel. If I
am correct in this interpretation, I wonder if the authors could play up this unique
aspect of the work a bit more in the discussion and maybe in an extra line or two in
the abstract.
After following the suggestion of Reviewer 1 of replacing "number of female
bystanders" by "number of higher-ranking female bystanders" and finding that
the number of higher-ranking females did not inhibit copulations, we now
conclude that only males inhibit the sexual behaviour of oestrous females
(please see above). We have however edited extensively the ms to emphasize
the novelty of our approach (L63-72 and L92-95) and results (see new
discussion).
It may be widely used in this context in the primate literature, but “audience” and
“audience effect” have pretty distinct meanings in animal communication – when a
signaler’s signal use varies depending upon the nature of the receivers in the
immediate social environment. Such audience effects are one type of social influence
on behavior typically referred to as social facilitation (the “audience” makes certain
behavior more likely) or social inhibition (the “audience” makes certain behavior less
likely to be performed). The author might wish to consider using the terms social
facilitation / inhibition instead of audience effects?
Thanks for this suggestion. However, we find it easier to use the term
"audience effect" compared to "social inhibition", in part because we cannot
know what we will find (social facilitation vs inhibition) before running
analyses, and also because a phenomenon of social inhibition/facilitation may
occur in a wider set of contexts than just audience effects (for example, social
copying may represent one type of social facilitation). Also, the term "audience
effect" was used in the same context in previous relevant literature, e.g:

copulation calls
flexibly to prevent social competition. PLoS One 3, e2431.

behavior. Am J

We hope that’s OK. We have precised the definition of audience effect in the
introduction (L64-65).
In lines 46-51, the authors raise a number of predictions regarding their study. I
suggest they use the word “expect” in place of “predict” here, given the lack of explicit
hypotheses being raised. Even better, though, I think the manuscript would be
strengthened considerably if the authors could raise two or more explicit hypotheses
from the literature that could be tested by their data set, and then lay out the specific
predictions of each hypothesis here in this concluding paragraph of the Introduction.
The ultimate goal in the study would then be to determine if the findings rule out at
least one of those hypotheses.
We have now clearly stated our hypotheses at the end of the introduction.
Previous research in our population has emphasized intense sexual coercion
(Baniel et al. 2017) as well as aggressive reproductive competition between
females for access to mating opportunities with particular males (Baniel et al.
2018a; Baniel et al. 2018b). These two behavioural phenomena both target
oestrous females. We therefore test three distinct hypotheses: (H1) females
inhibit their mating activity in front of adult males to minimize their exposition
to sexual coercion, (H2) females inhibit their mating activity in front of adult
females to minimize their exposition to aggressive reproductive competition,
and (H3) male bystanders have a stronger inhibiting effect than female
bystanders because males are the main source of injuries for oestrous females
(see rephrasing L95-102).
In lines 60-67 the authors should ideally indicate that data were coded blind with
regard to hypotheses being tested / classes of animal (e.g., females with or without
female composition in immediate social environment) and/or report what their inter-
rater agreement was in the data coding described here.
We have added a sentence confirming that all observers collecting the focal
observations were blind to the research questions, except for AB who led the
project (L135-136). However, scans were part of a broader protocol aimed at
testing a variety of research questions, so that AB did not concentrate on this
particular question when recording observations and should not have biased
the data in any direction. It is extremely challenging to collect this kind of
naturalistic observations from a logistical perspective, and often impossible for
the project leader -- who usually contributes to the research design and trains
the field team -- to be excluded from data collection. In total, 8 people
contributed to collect the focal observations included in this analysis. The 7
research assistants have been heavily trained by AB to identify individual
baboons (who have individual marks, in the form of ear notches, to facilitate
behavioural data collection) and to collect accurate focal observations. Focal
observations are usually run by two observers in parallel as part of the
assistant training and until the level of agreement is sufficiently high (e.g., we
target full agreement on individual identities recorded during one given
observation). These parallel observations are excluded from the final dataset
because performed during the training period so we cannot provide a
quantitative figure for the inter-rate agreement statistics.
Minor comments by line number:
26. I suggest the authors replace “...to reduce their..." with “...in ways that reduce
those females’...” to avoid the possible implication that dominant females do this
behavior intentionally.
This has been edited as recommended (L45).
43-45. I do not know if there is another way to write this, but this sentence made me
think that, after reading the authors’ abstract, the authors already knew what the
outcome of their study would be. Perhaps in this paragraph the authors could build up
in a sentence or two how their new study differs from / adds to what we already knew
about social influences on sexual behavior in chacma baboons?
This sentence refers to previously published work in our study population,
where we studied patterns of aggression exchanged between females. We
found that oestrus females harass each other when competing over preferred
male mating partners (Huchard and Cowlishaw 2011; Baniel et al. 2018a), and
that pregnant and lactating females harass oestrus females when they are
mating with the father of their offspring (as a form of reproductive suppression
strategy to monopolize paternal care) (Baniel et al. 2018b). We have edited the
sentence to clarify previous findings (L76-88) and have indicated what remains
unknown so far (L88-95).
49. By ‘mate-guarding status’ do the authors mean the status of the male doing the
mate guarding?
We meant the status of the oestrus female (unguarded versus mate-guarded by
a male). We have now clarified this: "by the mate-guarding status of the female”
(L104).
80 and elsewhere. Unless “baseline” is frequently used in this way in this literature, I
would suggest the authors use “non-copulation scans” here. When I read “baseline” I
typically think of non-experimental stimulus conditions in an experimental study.
We have changed here and elsewhere "baseline scans" by "non-copulation
scans" (e.g. L152, 154,155, 156, 158, 164, etc).
105-108. I appreciate the difficulty of obtaining these data from wild animals, and
appreciate the arguments against a strict interpretation of “significance only when p
<=0.05”, but a p = 0.093 seems questionable to interpret as being a significant finding
here.
We think this is a misunderstanding. We have never interpreted a p-value of
0.093 as being significant – and would never do so, regardless of our working
conditions. The main result referred to as significant in this sentence concerns
the simple effect of the number of male bystanders, which is actually clearly
significant (see Table 2: LRT=49.02 and p<0.001). The p-value of 0.093 stands
for the interaction term ‘number of mate-guarding males*mate-guarding status’.
This interaction term, which is non-significant, is given in the main text because
it has been removed from the final model (as stated in the methods, non-
significant interactions are omitted from the final model to avoid over-
parameterization and facilitate the interpretation of simple effects) and
therefore does not figure in Table 2. We have now rephrased the sentence to
avoid similar confusion: "Oestrous females initiated fewer copulations when
the audience contained more adult males, and this was true for both unguarded
and mate-guarded females (comparison of models with and without an
interaction between number of male bystanders and mate-guarding status:
=2.06, p=0.151)." (L216-218). Note that in the new model including higher-
ranking females, the p-value of the interaction is 0.151 instead of 0.093.
117. this is a reference to the males doing the mate guarding, correct?
Sorry if this was unclear. We were talking about the mate-guarding status of
females. We have now clarified it (L235).
139-154. Following from a point raised above, this paragraph seems to discuss the
key *new* information this study contributes to the literature. I wonder if it might be
worth expanding on the importance / implications of this in a paragraph to follow this
one, assuming the authors are not up against tight word limit constraints.
Given the new results that the number of higher-ranking female bystanders
does increase the mating activity of mate-guarded females, we cannot expand
on the inhibition effect by female bystanders. Instead, we discuss in more
details the male inhibiting effect, which could represent a form of indirect
sexual coercion (L251-279) and the interpretation of the female effect (L280-
307).
156. The phrase “where females inhibit sexual behavior” suggests females have
voluntary control over the behavior. This may be true, but if this is not what the
authors mean (or what studies have shown) perhaps the authors could write
something like “where sexual behavior in females is inhibited” here?
Thanks for pointing this confusing sentence. Here, we were referring to the
strategies of the oestrous females, and not of the female bystanders. We
rephrased as follow "where females avoid copulating inhibit sexual behaviour
in the presence of certain bystanders or take advantage of their absence" (309).

Appendix C
Response to referees
We would like to thank the Editor and the Reviewer for their comments on our
manuscript. Our responses are presented below, in bold and blue characters.
Reviewer: 2
The authors have done a really good job of addressing comments of the earlier
reviews, and the manuscript is stronger for it. I only have a small number of relatively
minor suggestions - mostly stylistic. It was a pleasure to review both versions of this
really strong study!
I still question the use of “audience effects” here given the centrality of animal
communication to that term. Why not simply use “social influence”, if “facilitation” or
“inhibition” are too directional for the nature of the questions asked here?
Alternatively, perhaps state in a sentence that follows lines 62-64 that the authors are
aware they are defining audience effects here more broadly than is typically
considered (and perhaps cite the short Zuberbühler (2008) review of audience effects
in Current Biology)?
We have replaced the term "audience effect" by "social influence" or ‘social
constraints’ or ‘social inhibition’ throughout the manuscript (e.g. L64, 68, 69,
80, 91, 106, etc).
In line 85, the authors use the word “friend” – I realize this is becoming more
commonplace in non-human primate literature, but I wonder if it is the most
appropriate word here, given its connection to the male mating partner of the female.
Does “friend” really capture the nature of that relationship?
"with their male friend" has been replaced by "with the sire of their offspring"
(L87)
Line 187 has a reference to “baseline”
"baseline" has been replaced by "non-copulation scans" (L197).
In line 240, I suggest replacing “is likely to reflect” with “reflects”, since the earlier use
of “suggesting” already implies a likelihood rather than a certainty
Done (L250).
In line 248, you could delete the “may” for the same reason related to the use of
“suggest”
Done (L258).
In line 253 you can delete the comma after “Although”
Done (L263).
In line 275, you could delete the “may” for the same “suggest” reason
Done (L287).
In line 280, you could replace “may not be” with “is not” for the same “suggest” reason
Done (L291).
In line 304, it is not immediately clear what the “it” refers to – it might make it easier
for a reader to specify this
"it" has been replaced by "this social inhibition" (L316).
