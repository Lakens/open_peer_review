In this work, the ceramics(Li0.9<U+25A1>0.1NiV0.5P0.5O4) was prepared, The AC electrical conductivity,
the dielectric relaxation properties, of this compound have been investigated by means of
impedance spectroscopy measurements. Then the Temperature dependence of the dc
conductivity and modulus was fitted, the conduction mechanism was determined. The work is
solid, however, a few problems still exist and need to be solved if the paper could be possible for
publication in the journal.
1. In the title, Li0.9<U+25A1>0.1NiV0.5P0.5O4, did one of the elements miss? Please check it.
2. In the paper, a lot of words were overlapped, the blank space should be inserted, such as,
characteristicsof, importantto, electronicdevices, et al. The author should check them.
3. In the Introduction part, the author only showed the importance cathode materials for the
lithium ion batteries. There are many compound used in the Li-ion battery, Why does the author
focus on the Li0.9<U+25A1>0.1NiV0.5P0.5O4? What is the advantage of that compound? And the
Introduction part should be reorganized.
4. In page 3, line 53, the sentence ‘The structural properties of the samples were studied by using
the X-ray diffraction (XRD).’ should be deleted. It is redundant.
5. In Fig.1, there are four curves, there are no explanation on the Yobs, Ycalc, Yobs-Ycalc,
Bragg_position, the author should explain the intent.
6. In Fig.2~Fig.10, the author fitted the curves, the author should show the fitting parameters and
their value. In addition, based on the fitting parameters, the author should show the changing
trend of those parameters.
7. After the measurement of the compound, the author should compare the determining factor
with other compound used in the Li-ion battery, it maybe useful for this work.

Comments to the Author(s)
n this work, the ceramics(Li0.9<U+25A1>0.1NiV0.5P0.5O4) was prepared, The AC electrical conductivity, the
dielectric relaxation properties, of this compound have been investigated by means of impedance
pectroscopy measurements. Then the Temperature dependence of the dc conductivity and modulus
was fitted, the conduction mechanism was determined. The work is solid, however, a few problems still
exist and need to be solved if the paper could be possible for publication in the journal.
Question 1
1. In the title, Li0.9<U+25A1>0.1NiV0.5P0.5O4, did one of the elements miss? Please check it.
Response
no, it is correct, there is no forgotten element in the title: there is in fact a deficit (vacancy or
acunar) in the lithium site.
Question 2
2. In the paper, a lot of words were overlapped, the blank space should be inserted, such as,
characteristicsof, importantto, electronicdevices, et al. The author should check them.
Response
You are quite right. I have corrected this in our revised manuscript.
Question 3
3. In the Introduction part, the author only showed the importance cathode materials for the
lithium ion batteries. There are many compound used in the Li-ion battery, Why does the
author focus on the Li0.9<U+25A1>0.1NiV0.5P0.5O4? What is the advantage of that compound? And
the Introduction part should be reorganized.
Response
Olivine-type compounds are of great interest as candidate materials for lithium-ion batteries,
ever since the discovery of the insertion-deinsertion properties of lithium in LiFePO4 [1]. This
esult has led to new investigations of lithium storage electrodes among materials belonging to
amilies of polyanionic compounds, especially olivine-type compounds.
Olivine-type LiNiPO4 [5, 6] has been considered as a most competitive positive electrode active
material for lithium-ion batteries. Our previously oxide LiNiV0.5P0.5O4 [7] which belongs to the
olivine-type family, is also promising cathode materials for application in lithium-ion batteries.
According to our knowledge, the lacunar plays an important role on the physical properties of
many oxides. Therefore, there is no work done on the lacunar in the orthophospho-vanadium
mixed oxide. From this, comes our idea of creating a vacancy in the lithium site of
LiNiV0.5P0.5O4 compound, for the research of a new cathodic materials.
So the present work aims to synthesize for the first time a mixed oxide with a 10% lithium
deficiency. We propose to investigate, structural, electrical and dielectrical properties of the
mixed compound Li0.9<U+F083>0.1NiV0.5P0.5O4 as a function of frequency and temperature.
We have added this in the introduction section of our revised manuscript.
n the introduction section we have added three references that hve numbered [5, 6 and 7].
Therefore, the number of reference that are <U+F0B3>5, are changed by adding +3.
We have also added phrases in the abstract and in the conclusion to show that our compound
with lithium vacancy is promising cathode material for application in lithium-ion batteries.
Question 4
4. In page 3, line 53, the sentence ‘The structural properties of the samples were studied by using
the X-ray diffraction (XRD).’ should be deleted. It is redundant.
Response
We have removed this sentence from the crystalline parameters section 3.1.
Question 5
5. In Fig.1, there are four curves, there are no explanation on the Yobs, Ycalc, Yobs-Ycalc,
Bragg_position, the author should explain the intent.
Response
Here Yobs, Ycal, Yobs–Ycal and Bragg position represent the experimental data, calculated
data, the difference of experimental and calculated data and Bragg's positions, respectively.
We have added this in our revised manuscript in the fig.1 caption section.
Question 6
6. In Fig.2~Fig.10, the author fitted the curves, the author should show the fitting parameters
and their value. In addition, based on the fitting parameters, the author should show the
changing trend of those parameters.
Response
You are quite right; we have added a table1 which presents the extracted parameters for the
circuit elements. There is a good conformity of the calculated lines with the experimental data
observed in Figs. 2, 3(a) and 3(b) indicates that the suggested equivalent circuit describes the
crystal–electrolyte interface reasonably well.
We have added a table 2 and fig.11 for comparison with the parent compound LiNiV05P05O4
We have added a table 3 for the extracted parameters for the M”(w) curves fitted using the
equation 10 in our revised manuscript.
7. After the measurement of the compound, the author should compare the determining factor with
other compound used in the Li-ion battery, it may be useful for this work.
You are quite right. We have added this comparison in our revised manuscript. (see in our
evised manuscript the impedance studies section3.2 and the Ac conductivity section3.5). also,
we have added a fig11 for comparison.
