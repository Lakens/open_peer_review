The authors proposed a DCT-SVD image watermarking scheme. the grayscale cover image and
watermark image are decomposed into non overlapping blocks and subsequently some selected
image blocks are transformed into DCT domain for inserting the watermark blocks permanently.
The paper needs a lot of improvement as follows:
1) The main point in the paper that the proposed scheme is subjected to the false positive
problem. The authors can check easily where since the UWp and VWp are used in the extraction.
Please check the
"Security analyses of the watermarking scheme based on redundantdiscrete wavelet transform
and singular value decomposition" International Journal of Electronics and Communications
(AEÜ).
2) In Table 20, also Makbol et al. and Lai et al. are suffering the false positive problem.
3) The references numbers in the manuscript are not correct as mentioned in the references.
4) The chart figures are not clear. I advise the authors to remove some of them while enlarge the
others. The authors can bold the best results in the result tables.
5) The references need to be updated. 2014 is the recent reference.
6) The authors need to do statistical test to prove the robustness of their proposed scheme. They

This work lacks a novelty. The problem for robust watermarking has been solved long time ago.
The use of DCT followed by SVD grants the robustness to the method. The most important issue
with watermarking is a security in the modern context. Authors must highlight the security
aspect of the method. Similar robustness can also be obtained by using SVD. The usage of two
specific domains for robust domain watermarking domain will also increase the computational
complexity. What is the basis for selection of different attacks simulated in the experimentation.

In this manuscript, a DCT and SVD based hybrid robust image watermarking scheme is
proposed and
simulated. The idea of the proposed method is effective and experimental results are satisfactory.
However, I feel that there are sufficient scope to improve the
presented work.
(1) Introduction part is quite lengthy. It is better to present in concise form.
(2)The description of DCT and SVD algorithms is too redundant.

MODIFICATION SUMMARY
Respected Sir,
We are very grateful to have been given the opportunity to revise our manuscript.
We carefully consider your comments as well as all the comments provided by the
reviewers. We summarize all the modifications made by us during correction process of our
paper in the below section:
Paper DCT-SVD based Robust Image Watermarking Scheme using Arnold
Title: Scrambling
Authors Soumitra Roy and Arup Kumar Pal
Reviewer #1’s comment:The main point in the paper that the proposed scheme is subjected
to the false positive problem. The authors can check easily where since the UWp and VWp
are used in the extraction. Please check the"Security analyses of the watermarking scheme
based on redundantdiscrete wavelet transform and singular value decomposition"
International Journal of Electronics and Communications (AEÜ).
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0B7> Modern researchers suggest lots of solutions for the security issues like (i) Lower
invisibility,(ii) false positive detection problem,(iii)diagonal line problem of SVD based
watermarking algorithms. It has been solved by adopting a digital signature into the
watermarked image by Makbol et al.[19] . In another research work, Loukhaoukha et
al.[20] encrypt the watermark before inserting it into the cover object. This encryption
policy is adopted in this proposed method.
<U+F0B7> In this modification process, paper title is also different now.
Reviewer #1’s comment:In Table 20, also Makbol et al. and Lai et al. are suffering the false
positive problem.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0B7> Table 20 is now Table 21.Table 21 is modified according to the suggestion.
Reviewer #1’s comment:The references numbers in the manuscript are not correct as
mentioned in the references.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0B7> Referencesection is adjusted according to the modification of the paper.
Reviewer #1’s comment:The chart figures are not clear. I advise the authors to remove
some of them while enlarge the others. The authors can bold the best results in the result
tables.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0B7> This suggestion is followed to enhance the some section of the paper.
Reviewer #1’s comment:The references need to be updated. 2014 is the recent reference.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0B7> This section is altered according to the need.
Reviewer #1’s comment:The authors need to do statistical test to prove the robustness of
their proposed scheme. The authors can read this paper"A new robust and secure digital
image watermarking scheme based on the integer wavelet transform and singular value
decomposition"
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0B7> In this paper, special attention is given to security issues like (i) Lower invisibility,(ii)
false positive detection problem,(iii)diagonal line problem of SVD based watermarking
algorithms.In this proposed technique, watermark is scrambled before inserting it into the
cover object to overcome the above stated security issues.
<U+F0B7> Also, the Experimental Results section is re-written. Now,the proposed DCT –SVD based
watermarking scheme are tested with various experiments in terms of imperceptibility,
robustness, security and capacity analysis.
Reviewer #1’s comment:The manuscript need to be proofreading
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0B7> Manuscript is checked minutely to remove grammar and language errors. Some sentences
and words are revised in this process.
Reviewer #2’s comment:This work lacks a novelty. The problem for robust watermarking
has been solved long time ago. The use of DCT followed by SVD grants the robustness to
the method. The most important issue with watermarking is a security in the modern context.
Authors must highlight the security aspect of the method.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0D8> SVD based watermarking scheme suffers from security issues like (i) Lower
invisibility,(ii) false positive detection problem,(iii)diagonal line problem. The security
aspect of the proposed method is discussed in the Experimental Results section.
Reviewer #2’s comment:Similar robustness can also be obtained by using SVD. The usage
of two specific domains for robust domain watermarking domain will also increase the
computational complexity.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0D8> To achieve better robustness and high imperceptibility, recently researchers have
developed their watermarking scheme using two or three transform domain technique.
These hybrid domain techniques provide better results than their single counterpart. In
addition to this, the application of SVD mechanism in one single image requires huge
computation as suggested by Makbol et al.[12].So hybrid domain watermarking scheme
is becoming more effective than pure SVD,though this policy increases computational
complexity.
Reviewer #2’s comment:What is the basis for selection of different attacks simulated in the
experimentation.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F0D8> For performance evaluation and fair benchmarking, the proposed technique is verified
against various attacks. In[26](by Voloshynovskiy et al.), Stirmarkbenchmark is
represented as a watermarking scheme benchmark where different types of image
watermarking scheme attacks are divided into some categories like signal enhancement,
compression, scaling, cropping, shearing, rotation, linear transformations, other geometric
transformations and random geometric distortions. These attacks are divided into three
sections according to their properties as described in[25](by Kutter et al.).
Reviewer #3’s comment:Introduction part is quite lengthy. It is better to present in concise
form.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F076> This section is modified. Now, it is presented in concise form.
Reviewer #3’s comment:The description of DCT and SVD algorithms is too redundant.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F076> Preliminaries Section is altered according to the need.
Reviewer #3’s comment:For better robustness test, author should try some computational
attacks. These typesofcomputational attacks are found in the following paper:“Das
C,Panigrahi S, Sharma VK, Mahapatra KK,2014, A novel blind robust imagewatermarking
in DCT domain using inter-block coefficientcorrelation.AEU-InternationalJournal of
Electronics and Communications 68(3):244-253.”
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F076> For robustness test, the proposed method is verified against some combinational attacks.
Results of some of the combinational attacks are presented in the Experimental Results
section.
Reviewer #3’s comment:How can you improve the performance of the algorithm?
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F076> To improve the performance, the proposed DCT –SVD based watermarking scheme are
tested with various experiments in terms of imperceptibility, robustness, security and
capacity analysis.
Reviewer #3’s comment:Several grammatical and type errors are presented.
Answer/Actions taken in response to the Reviewer’s comments/suggestions:
<U+F076> Carefully, the manuscript is studied multiple times to detect and remove the grammatical
mistakes. Also, some sections are added and some sections are re-written in this revision
process.
We have tried our best to upgrade the paper manuscript according to valuable comments of
reviewers.
Thanks.
