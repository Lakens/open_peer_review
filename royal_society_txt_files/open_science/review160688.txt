General Comments
This is a great analysis of the proportion of the sky that would be useful for human navigation
using celestial polarisation patterns relative to meteorological conditions.
My only major concern with the manuscript is the comparison of the three different wavelength
bands used. It is not necessary to provide all three colour bands, and in fact it detracts from the
story by making it more complicated than it needs to be. The entoptics phenomenon of
Haidinger's brushes is mediated by the absorption of short-wavelength light by the macular
carotenoids (lutien, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin) (Müller et al 2016, and Bone 1984) and is
not visible at wavelengths above about 500 nm, therefore the two colour bands in the green and
red are not useful for perception of polarization and therefore do not add to your argument.
Instead the extra data makes the story more confusing. If you remove the colour component you
can focus on the main effect in the blue and make the story more concise and more easily
accessible.
In case you are interested, the original experiments we did (Temple et al. 2015) were done with
humans looking at a modified LCD screen, however, I have since measured the human threshold
using a sheet of rotating polarizer combined with a series of my custom made depolarizing filters
and found that the human threshold is even lower than 23% we originally reported. Out of 20
people studied, four individuals could see HB down to 16% and one could go as low as 12%. In
this study the mean d* was 32.4% and the min was 70%. If you want to add these results to this
paper you could report them as unpublished data or personal communication. This work was
done as part of a preliminary experiment that showed a correlation between threshold for
detecting HB (d*) and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measured on a dual wavelength
scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Spectralis). These results concur with recent findings
of Müller et al. 2016 (Müller PL, Müller S, Gliem M, et al. Perception of Haidinger brushes in
macular disease depends on macular pigment density and visual acuity. Invest Ophthalmol Vis
Sci. 2016;57:1448–1456. DOI:10.1167/ iovs.15-19004).
It is not helpful for the reader when sentences have too many equations (e.g. P5 L5-11 ) or are
written around a figure (e.g. start with "Figure x shows..."). It is much easier to read and
understand the point being made if the sentences are written in words and just tell the story,
leaving the equations and figures to the end to be put in parentheses e.g. Page 3 Line 56 "Figure 2
shows a totally overcast sky taken with our full-sky imaging polarimeter when the solar elevation
was <U+03B8> = 0º and the cloud percent was <U+03C1> = 100 %." It is much easier to understand if you focus on
the results not the figure, as I have tried to do here "When skies are clear the proportion of the
celestial hemisphere P suitable for human polarimetric navigation based on perception of
Haidinger's brushes is high (insert P-value here; Figure 2). However, when the sky is overcast, P
approaches 0 making it infeasible for navigation by this means (Fig. 3)." NOTE I would reverse
the order in which these two points are presented and start with the positive situation in which
polarimetric navigation IS possible rather than starting with when it IS NOT.
Specific Comments
To preclude, I really like this work and think that it will be a valuable contribution to the field but
that it needs to be written in a way that makes it more accessible to the reader, so I have provided
numerous suggestions below.

Page 1 Title
The title is long and not easily understandable, specifically the expression "sky-polarization
prerequisite" is not clear.
Please consider an alternative, for example a variation of:
Limits of human polarization perception support Viking navigation with the naked eye based on
celestial polarization patterns.
OR
Celestial polarization patterns sufficient for Viking Navigation with Haidinger's brushes.
OR
Viking navigation with Haidinger's brushes: assessment of the meteorological conditions and
proportion of the sky suitable based on human threshold for polarization perception.
Page 1 Line 25 (P1 L25) Here 'brush' is used rather than "brushes" I recommend brushes but pick
one and stick to it for consistency.
P1 L25 you have already said '8-shaped' and I am not sure that 'brush-like' is a good description, I
recall that the word brush was a poor translation of the German that was meant to be bushel, like
a bushel of wheat. A better description is 'bowtie-like' rather than 'brush-like'
P1 L25-28 This Sentence is long and difficult to understand with novel terminology that needs
defining upon first use.
"Since the celestial great circle passing through any sky point with high enough d-values and
parallel to the yellow Haidinger’s brush crosses the sun, if two such sky points are selected, the
sun position can be determined, which is at the intersection of the two great circles."
specifically you need to define or come up with a better description of "the celestial great circle"
And this statement is really unclear "passing through any sky point with high enough d-values
and parallel to the yellow Haidinger’s brush crosses the sun" please see if you can reword this.
The last part refers to "two great circles" but the first part makes it seem like there should only be
one "the celestial great circle".
Personally, I can see HB quite easily both in clear skies and in the forest when only a very small
portion of the clear sky is visible through the canopy, and I don't think it is necessary to talk
about 'great circles' but rather I think you could talk about a band of high degree of polarization
that arcs across the sky at about 90 degrees to the position of the sun and that a person could pick
two points on that band and observe the yellow brushes of HB and from that triangulate the
position of the sun based on the orientation of those two observed brushes. But equally it does
not need to be static observation. by sweeping your eye across the band of high DoP it is possible
to get a dynamic view of HB that point directly at the sun.
P1 L30 in addition to occlusion by cloud and fog, HB can also be used to locate the sun when it is
below the horizon or occluded by objects on the horizon.
P1 L30 the expression 'atmospheric optical prerequisite' is overly complicated, and this sentence
could be simplified to something like "In order to determine the position of the sun using the
celestial polarization pattern the d of the portion of the sky used, must be greater than the
viewers degree of polarization threshold (d*) for perception of Haidinger's brushes."
4
P1 L34 remove the red and green here and throughout the paper (see general comment above)
P1 L36 recommend changing 'cloud percent' to 'cloud cover (in percentage)'
P1 L37 the statement 'We obtained that P is large enough only for the most sensitive human
observers having perception threshold d*min = 23 % of Haidinger's brushes." does not make
sense. "Large enough" for what?
P1 L38 no space required between the number and the percent symbol, whereas there is a space
required between a number and most of other units (e.g. nm) but not degree.
P1 L39 recommend change to 'with cloud coverage of p = 0%, when the sun's position is already
easily determined." delete "since it is visible with a big chance".
P1 L42 again what does 'P is large enough' mean?
if P is the proportion of the sky where d>d* then surely an observer only needs a couple of small
areas of the sky that are larger the 5 degrees in radius (size of HB perception) to observe HB and
detect the position of the sun, so if the d is high then only a small portion of the sky located near
the band of maximum d is required. So what does 'large enough' mean?
P1 L45 change 'great' to 'large'
P1 L48 because on-line search engines will search your title and abstract it is redundant to use
keywords that are already in your title and abstract in your list of keywords. Instead consider
using other words that a potential reader might use to search for similar articles. e.g. calcite,
orientation, sea-faring, orienteering, migration, vision, macula, macular pigment etc...
P1 L53 see comment above about 'brush-like'
could add that the two 8-shaped figures combine to form a Maltese cross shape
P1 L54 & L55 stick to the '8-shaped figure' or perhaps 'bowtie-like shape' as used elsewhere
P1 L55 delete 'well-known'. Haidinger's brushes are certainly not well known. I have been
interested in this subject for near 20 years and very few vision scientists, optometrist, visual
ecologist have ever heard of them and even few of the general population.
P2 L2 change to 'brushes' here and throughout.
P2 L2 suggest removing the word 'well' most people find it difficult to perceive HB at the best of
times, and even those of us that can see them consistently would not say they are easy to see or
are highly salient, it suffices to say that they can be perceived.
P2 L4 suggest change to "when large portions of the sky are red and orange, or when the sky is..."
P2 L11 correct 'treshold' to 'threshold'
P2 L10 it is much easier to read if words are used rather than equations e.g. 'Recently, Temple et
al [13] measured the degree of polarization threshold, d*, at which humans could just detect
Haidinger's brushes.
P2 L14 consider adding to this sentence as such "determined by the relative position of the
observer, the sun and the celestial point observed (Fig. 1)."
P2 L21 this 'celestial great circle' needs to be well defined earlier in the paper if it is going to be
used. Otherwise consider 'band of highest polarization'
5
P2 L24 if is not clear why there are now 'two great circles'. I know what you are talking about but
it is not written clearly enough for someone slightly unfamiliar with the specifics to understand it
well enough. Furthermore there are no 'great circles' in your figure 1, nor should there be. I think
it easier to describe it somewhat as I have in my comment above re P1 L25-28.
P2 L34 change to 'they had their own analyser..."
P2 L43 change to past tense 'the aim of this work was to study'
P2 L44-45 remove red and green from here and the paper in general
P2 L47 change to 'percent cloud cover' here and throughout the manuscript
P2 L50 used past conditional past tense ' navigation could have been based on the perception...'
P3 L14 change to 'coverage of the visible sky estimated by visual examination [40].'
P3 L15 suggest 'refer to ever increasing cloud coverage'
P3 L24 spelling 'approximately'
P3 L30-32 this is a bit confusing, it is clear that there were 12 sun azimuth groups and 9 cloud
coverage groups, but what are the '12 different skies"? Are these just 12 examples/samples of
each of the above 108 groups? if so then this needs to me spelled out (described) more clearly.
P3 L32-34 delete reference to colour
P3 L43 consider 'probability that a viewer (Viking) with high, average and low sensitivity,
respectively, ...'
P3 L45 remove reference to colour
P3 L50 the statement says that the areas that were not sky were masked out but they still show up
in the figures (e.g. Fig 2 c,d, & e and 4 c,d & e) with red and blue regions suggesting under and
overexposed regions, but really this just detracts from the message you are trying to get accross,
so I recommend blacking out the non-sky regions in these images to remove the red a blue that is
not in the sky (the only part of interest here).
P3L57 see note in general comments about the order of presentation of results. Start with the
positive situation i.e. clear skies (section 3.2 rather than 3.1) and use full sentences that do not
start with "Figure X shows..."
Actually by the time you remove the parts of 3.1 and 3.2 that belong in discussion and remove the
reference to red and green the sections will be short enough that they can be combined into a
single section that just focuses on percent cloud cover.
P4 L9-12 this statement is interpretation of the results and therefore belongs in discussion section
not results.
P4 L16 change sentence so it does not start with "Figure 4A..."
P4 L22-29 this statement is interpretation of the results and therefore belongs in discussion
section not results.
P4 L31 consider changing to "sun elevation-cloud cover matrix..."
6
P4 L33 change sentence so it does not start with "Figure 6..."
P4 L44 change sentence so it says something more like "A person having low polarization
sensitivity (e.g. d*max = 87%) can only detect HB under a select few meteorological conditions
(Fig 6; Supplementary table S3, S6, S9) and would therefore be an unlikely choice for a Viking
navigator."
In the discussion, you could suggest that Viking navigators were likely those that had the highest
polarization sensitivity (So move P4 L59 to discussion), you could also add that a diet rich in fish,
which is a good source of macular carotenoids, may have contributed to Viking's general ability
to see HB.
P4 L50 same as above.
P5L5-11 this paragraph is almost incomprehensible, it is written as an equation masquerading as
a sentence. Rewrite as a sentence with words rather than symbols.
P5 L20 This paragraph starts off well with clear words used to describe everything and then the
reader gets to this line that starts with <P>(<U+03B8>,<U+03C1>), and gets totally lost. Please write out in words
what these symbols mean as you did in the first two sentences.
P5 L25 need to change this to blue since polarization sensitivity has nothing to do with the
human spectral sensitivity curve that peaks in green, and everything to do with the polarization
sensitivity, which is maximal at 460 nm (2nd sentence of Chapter 14 of your book Gábor that we
wrote together) due to absorption of macular pigments (Bone 1980 Vision research 20:213-220).
The statement that blue can be ignored is incorrect. In blue light the HB become clearer, and it is
thought that the yellow colour a person sees under full spectrum illumination is a psychophysical
effect of the eye where yellow is perceived when there is an absence of blue.
I agree that the blue brushes of HB are or little utility for navigation but that has nothing to do
with the spectral content of the sky.
P5 L31 & 34 again consider rewording the 'great circle passing the sun', especially the last part
'passing the sun' this does not make sense.
P5 L35-45 suggest changing to something like... "We found that the proportion of the sky suitable
for the humans with a high sensitivity to Haidinger's brushes (d*min = 23%) is high under
numerous meteorological conditions, particularly when the sun is low on the horizon and when
the sky is clear of cloud. When the sun is below the horizon, and therefore not possible to see or
accurately locate, the proportion of the sky suitable for sky polarimetric navigation is between
40% and 77% depending on cloud cover.
P5 L48 Need to define "3rd step" of just use the word-based description first and then put '3rd
step' in brackets and state that this is what they called it.
P5 L51 need to provide a very brief description of a twilight board and how it is used, or else this
statement is meaningless to the reader.
P6 L3 The few seconds before fading are irrelevant if you tilt your head back and forth while
looking at the sky and then use an object in the peripheral foreground (e.g. your arm) to point in
the direction of the yellow brushes.
P6 L11 You need to describe the 3 steps, otherwise the reader has no idea what you are referring
to.
7
figures
Figures 3 and 5 are confusing. I am well aware of the topic but cannot easily determine what
these plots are showing
Again I have no idea what Figure 7 is attempting to show, and the associated text in the
manuscript P4 L41 does not help. Please write out in words what the statement you are
attempting to make is and then use the figure to support that statement. This is important
because you want your reader to understand your results and be able to use them, if not why
bother publishing.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is an interesting paper that evaluates the hypothesis that Vikings could navigate using
polarisation patterns visible to the naked eye. This is assessed by using a large database of
recorded polarization levels in whole skies for different sun elevations and cloud cover
percentage, and comparing these to previously established thresholds for perception of
Haidinger's brushes.
The title seems overlong, Perhaps’delectability of polarization cues for navigation under varied
celestial conditions' would suffice?
The final sentence of the abstract wcould be clearer it rearranged - ‘is most useful after sunset and
prior to sunrise, when the sun is not visible and great sky' etc.
line 55- l don't think the brushes would be well known to the typical reader. This is also why I
suggest they are not featured in the title
8
p.2 line 10, it would be helpful to say a bit more about the thresholds. E-g. what percentile of
tested subjects meet the most sensitive threshold? Or do they mean to say the lowest threshold
measured for any subject was 23%, and the highest 87%? Is the distribution symmetric enough for
the average to be meaningful? Briefly, how was the threshold determined?
line 46, could mention the latitude of the measurements here (and somewhere in the discussion
explain whether and how this might affect the polarisaton
the final sentence of the introduction is uninformative, either remove or give an indication of the
results.
p3 liner 5, delete "from which we selected 1296 different skies". The grouping happens before the
selection. It does not seem necessary to spell out all the ranges, or to use a numerical subscript
rather than one that contains the relevant information.
p4 line 3 (fig 3) I do not understand the description of this figure as plotting P(d*). It plots d
against % sky with at least that value of d. The thresholds d* could be included in the figure, as
vertical lines at the relevant valves. The same applies to fig 5.
P4 line 28, if the elevation shown is 0 (as stated on line 16) then the elevation is not >0, so it is not
clear what point is being made here. The sun is not visible in fig 4A.
P5 lines 5 onward, it is not clear what information should be taken from the variance or delta_P.
How might this affect the use of the method?
P6 lines 7 onward, is it beyond the scope of this paper to carry out the error propagation steps to
determine the practicality of the method?

This is a great analysis of the proportion of the sky that would be useful for human navigation
using celestial polarisation patterns relative to meteorological conditions.
My only major concern with the manuscript is the comparison of the three different wavelength

It is not helpful for the reader when sentences have too many equations (e.g. P5 L5-11 ) or are

approaches 0 making it infeasible for navigation by this means (Fig. 3)." NOTE I would reverse

And this statement is really unclear "passing through any sky point with high enough d-values
and parallel to the yellow Haidinger’s brush crosses the sun" please see if you can reword this.
The last part refers to "two great circles" but the first part makes it seem like there should only be
one "the celestial great circle".
Personally, I can see HB quite easily both in clear skies and in the forest when only a very small
portion of the clear sky is visible through the canopy, and I don't think it is necessary to talk
about 'great circles' but rather I think you could talk about a band of high degree of polarization
that arcs across the sky at about 90 degrees to the position of the sun and that a person could pick
two points on that band and observe the yellow brushes of HB and from that triangulate the
position of the sun based on the orientation of those two observed brushes. But equally it does
not need to be static observation. by sweeping your eye across the band of high DoP it is possible
to get a dynamic view of HB that point directly at the sun.
P1 L30 in addition to occlusion by cloud and fog, HB can also be used to locate the sun when it is
below the horizon or occluded by objects on the horizon.
P1 L30 the expression 'atmospheric optical prerequisite' is overly complicated, and this sentence
could be simplified to something like "In order to determine the position of the sun using the
celestial polarization pattern the d of the portion of the sky used, must be greater than the
viewers degree of polarization threshold (d*) for perception of Haidinger's brushes."
13
P1 L34 remove the red and green here and throughout the paper (see general comment above)
P1 L36 recommend changing 'cloud percent' to 'cloud cover (in percentage)'
P1 L37 the statement 'We obtained that P is large enough only for the most sensitive human
observers having perception threshold d*min = 23 % of Haidinger's brushes." does not make
sense. "Large enough" for what?
P1 L38 no space required between the number and the percent symbol, whereas there is a space
required between a number and most of other units (e.g. nm) but not degree.
P1 L39 recommend change to 'with cloud coverage of p = 0%, when the sun's position is already
easily determined." delete "since it is visible with a big chance".
P1 L42 again what does 'P is large enough' mean?
if P is the proportion of the sky where d>d* then surely an observer only needs a couple of small
areas of the sky that are larger the 5 degrees in radius (size of HB perception) to observe HB and
detect the position of the sun, so if the d is high then only a small portion of the sky located near
the band of maximum d is required. So what does 'large enough' mean?
P1 L45 change 'great' to 'large'
P1 L48 because on-line search engines will search your title and abstract it is redundant to use
keywords that are already in your title and abstract in your list of keywords. Instead consider
using other words that a potential reader might use to search for similar articles. e.g. calcite,
orientation, sea-faring, orienteering, migration, vision, macula, macular pigment etc...
P1 L53 see comment above about 'brush-like'
could add that the two 8-shaped figures combine to form a Maltese cross shape
P1 L54 & L55 stick to the '8-shaped figure' or perhaps 'bowtie-like shape' as used elsewhere
P1 L55 delete 'well-known'. Haidinger's brushes are certainly not well known. I have been
interested in this subject for near 20 years and very few vision scientists, optometrist, visual
ecologist have ever heard of them and even few of the general population.
P2 L2 change to 'brushes' here and throughout.
P2 L2 suggest removing the word 'well' most people find it difficult to perceive HB at the best of
times, and even those of us that can see them consistently would not say they are easy to see or
are highly salient, it suffices to say that they can be perceived.
P2 L4 suggest change to "when large portions of the sky are red and orange, or when the sky is..."
P2 L11 correct 'treshold' to 'threshold'
P2 L10 it is much easier to read if words are used rather than equations e.g. 'Recently, Temple et
al [13] measured the degree of polarization threshold, d*, at which humans could just detect
Haidinger's brushes.
P2 L14 consider adding to this sentence as such "determined by the relative position of the
observer, the sun and the celestial point observed (Fig. 1)."
P2 L21 this 'celestial great circle' needs to be well defined earlier in the paper if it is going to be
used. Otherwise consider 'band of highest polarization'
14
P2 L24 if is not clear why there are now 'two great circles'. I know what you are talking about but
it is not written clearly enough for someone slightly unfamiliar with the specifics to understand it
well enough. Furthermore there are no 'great circles' in your figure 1, nor should there be. I think
it easier to describe it somewhat as I have in my comment above re P1 L25-28.
P2 L34 change to 'they had their own analyser..."
P2 L43 change to past tense 'the aim of this work was to study'
P2 L44-45 remove red and green from here and the paper in general
P2 L47 change to 'percent cloud cover' here and throughout the manuscript
P2 L50 used past conditional past tense ' navigation could have been based on the perception...'
P3 L14 change to 'coverage of the visible sky estimated by visual examination [40].'
P3 L15 suggest 'refer to ever increasing cloud coverage'
P3 L24 spelling 'approximately'
P3 L30-32 this is a bit confusing, it is clear that there were 12 sun azimuth groups and 9 cloud
coverage groups, but what are the '12 different skies"? Are these just 12 examples/samples of
each of the above 108 groups? if so then this needs to me spelled out (described) more clearly.
P3 L32-34 delete reference to colour
P3 L43 consider 'probability that a viewer (Viking) with high, average and low sensitivity,
respectively, ...'
P3 L45 remove reference to colour
P3 L50 the statement says that the areas that were not sky were masked out but they still show up
in the figures (e.g. Fig 2 c,d, & e and 4 c,d & e) with red and blue regions suggesting under and
overexposed regions, but really this just detracts from the message you are trying to get accross,
so I recommend blacking out the non-sky regions in these images to remove the red a blue that is
not in the sky (the only part of interest here).
P3L57 see note in general comments about the order of presentation of results. Start with the
positive situation i.e. clear skies (section 3.2 rather than 3.1) and use full sentences that do not
start with "Figure X shows..."
Actually by the time you remove the parts of 3.1 and 3.2 that belong in discussion and remove the
reference to red and green the sections will be short enough that they can be combined into a
single section that just focuses on percent cloud cover.
P4 L9-12 this statement is interpretation of the results and therefore belongs in discussion section
not results.
P4 L16 change sentence so it does not start with "Figure 4A..."
P4 L22-29 this statement is interpretation of the results and therefore belongs in discussion
section not results.
P4 L31 consider changing to "sun elevation-cloud cover matrix..."
15
P4 L33 change sentence so it does not start with "Figure 6..."
P4 L44 change sentence so it says something more like "A person having low polarization
sensitivity (e.g. d*max = 87%) can only detect HB under a select few meteorological conditions
(Fig 6; Supplementary table S3, S6, S9) and would therefore be an unlikely choice for a Viking
navigator."
In the discussion, you could suggest that Viking navigators were likely those that had the highest
polarization sensitivity (So move P4 L59 to discussion), you could also add that a diet rich in fish,
which is a good source of macular carotenoids, may have contributed to Viking's general ability
to see HB.
P4 L50 same as above.
P5L5-11 this paragraph is almost incomprehensible, it is written as an equation masquerading as
a sentence. Rewrite as a sentence with words rather than symbols.
P5 L20 This paragraph starts off well with clear words used to describe everything and then the
reader gets to this line that starts with <P>(<U+03B8>,<U+03C1>), and gets totally lost. Please write out in words
what these symbols mean as you did in the first two sentences.
P5 L25 need to change this to blue since polarization sensitivity has nothing to do with the
human spectral sensitivity curve that peaks in green, and everything to do with the polarization
sensitivity, which is maximal at 460 nm (2nd sentence of Chapter 14 of your book Gábor that we
wrote together) due to absorption of macular pigments (Bone 1980 Vision research 20:213-220).
The statement that blue can be ignored is incorrect. In blue light the HB become clearer, and it is
thought that the yellow colour a person sees under full spectrum illumination is a psychophysical
effect of the eye where yellow is perceived when there is an absence of blue.
I agree that the blue brushes of HB are or little utility for navigation but that has nothing to do
with the spectral content of the sky.
P5 L31 & 34 again consider rewording the 'great circle passing the sun', especially the last part
'passing the sun' this does not make sense.
P5 L35-45 suggest changing to something like... "We found that the proportion of the sky suitable
for the humans with a high sensitivity to Haidinger's brushes (d*min = 23%) is high under
numerous meteorological conditions, particularly when the sun is low on the horizon and when
the sky is clear of cloud. When the sun is below the horizon, and therefore not possible to see or
accurately locate, the proportion of the sky suitable for sky polarimetric navigation is between
40% and 77% depending on cloud cover.
P5 L48 Need to define "3rd step" of just use the word-based description first and then put '3rd
step' in brackets and state that this is what they called it.
P5 L51 need to provide a very brief description of a twilight board and how it is used, or else this
statement is meaningless to the reader.
P6 L3 The few seconds before fading are irrelevant if you tilt your head back and forth while
looking at the sky and then use an object in the peripheral foreground (e.g. your arm) to point in
the direction of the yellow brushes.
P6 L11 You need to describe the 3 steps, otherwise the reader has no idea what you are referring
to.
figures
16
Figures 3 and 5 are confusing. I am well aware of the topic but cannot easily determine what
these plots are showing
Again I have no idea what Figure 7 is attempting to show, and the associated text in the
manuscript P4 L41 does not help. Please write out in words what the statement you are
attempting to make is and then use the figure to support that statement. This is important
because you want your reader to understand your results and be able to use them, if not why
bother publishing.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting paper that evaluates the hypothesis that Vikings could navigate using
polarisation patterns visible to the naked eye. This is assessed by using a large database of
recorded polarization levels in whole skies for different sun elevations and cloud cover
percentage, and comparing these to previously established thresholds for perception of
Haidinger's brushes.
The title seems overlong, Perhaps’delectability of polarization cues for navigation under varied
celestial conditions' would suffice?
The final sentence of the abstract wcould be clearer it rearranged - ‘is most useful after sunset and
prior to sunrise, when the sun is not visible and great sky' etc.
line 55- l don't think the brushes would be well known to the typical reader. This is also why I
suggest they are not featured in the title
p.2 line 10, it would be helpful to say a bit more about the thresholds. E-g. what percentile of
tested subjects meet the most sensitive threshold? Or do they mean to say the lowest threshold
measured for any subject was 23%, and the highest 87%? Is the distribution symmetric enough for
the average to be meaningful? Briefly, how was the threshold determined?
line 46, could mention the latitude of the measurements here (and somewhere in the discussion
explain whether and how this might affect the polarisaton
the final sentence of the introduction is uninformative, either remove or give an indication of the
results.
p3 liner 5, delete "from which we selected 1296 different skies". The grouping happens before the
selection. It does not seem necessary to spell out all the ranges, or to use a numerical subscript
rather than one that contains the relevant information.
p4 line 3 (fig 3) I do not understand the description of this figure as plotting P(d*). It plots d
against % sky with at least that value of d. The thresholds d* could be included in the figure, as
vertical lines at the relevant valves. The same applies to fig 5.
17
P4 line 28, if the elevation shown is 0 (as stated on line 16) then the elevation is not >0, so it is not
clear what point is being made here. The sun is not visible in fig 4A.
P5 lines 5 onward, it is not clear what information should be taken from the variance or delta_P.
How might this affect the use of the method?
P6 lines 7 onward, is it beyond the scope of this paper to carry out the error propagation steps to
determine the practicality of the method?

the spectrum. We obtained that the mean <P> of P is large only for the most sensitive-eyed
observers (Viking navigators) having a perception threshold d*min = 23% of Haidinger’s

ost sensitive persons (d*min = 23%) possess the widest range of the standard deviation (1.97% =

Point-by-Point Response to the Comments of Reviewer 2
ank for the positive and constructive comments of Referee 2. Our manuscript was revised on the
f the reports of two Reviewers. All relevant changes performed on the basis of the comments of

r: Taking into consideration the suggestions of both Referees, the new title is:

r: This sentence was rewritten as follows:
quently, the sky-polarimetric Viking navigation based on Haidinger’s brushes is most useful
unset and prior to sunrise, when the sun is not visible and large sky regions are bright, clear and

e 2 wrote: line 55, I don't think the brushes would be well known to the typical reader. This is
hy I suggest they are not featured in the title.
r: The criticized word ’well-known’ was replaced by so-called:
are the so-called Haidinger’s brushes, the angular extension of which is about 5o centered at the
of the human retina, and are mediated by dichroic carotenoids in the macula lutea [1-7].’
er, we kept ’Haidinger’s brushes’ in the title, because they are the main subject of this paper.
e 2 wrote: p.2 line 10, it would be helpful to say a bit more about the thresholds. E-g. what

r: As requested, in the revised Introduction we added the following:

revised Discussion we wrote:
ugh we measured the sky polarization for 1296 meteorological situations with different solar
