This is an interesting study on the effects of phytoestrogenic root exudates on vertebrate
development.
I have found three points:
(1) One concern that must be discussed is that individuals were euthanized with beginning of
metamorphosis (Gosner stage 42) and not at completed metamorphosis (see below).
(2) The author must give a proper citation and explanation how to sex individuals without
histological examination!
(3) Another concern might be that there is no measurements of chemical compounds for quality
assurance (see below).
All in all, I recommend minor revision because of the overall value of the manuscript and because
I am aware that at least two out of these concerns (perhaps to early termination of the experiment
and measurements for quality assurance) cannot be subsequently done (the experiments are over)
and I think that it is adequate to discuss them and possible effects on the results in the present
manuscript.
Introduction
The introduction aims to highlight the main question/problem of endocrine disrupting natural
chemicals (here, phytoestrogens). All relevant literature has been considered. L. 63 Rana sylvatica
is now placed into the genus Lithobates (L. sylvaticus)
Methods
Are the phytoestrogenic root exudates (i.e. the chemical compounds) from red clover known and
- most important - measurable? If yes, why they have not been measured for quality assurance?
Please clarify in the text (here or in the discussion).
Using one egg clutch would ensure to test only siblings, but I suggest that randomly selected
individuals from two clutches (from one population) have not significantly influenced the results.
From the supplementray material, I am aware that 40 individuals were used per treatment?! I
think the number of individually maintained tadpoles per treatment should be stated in the
manuscript.
Only 0.06 g aquarium salt per liter of distilled water was added to maintain osmolarity. Many
other amphibian toxicological studies using embryos or early larvae used FETAX-solution, i.e.
distilled water with a defined amount of different nutrient salts added (see
http://www.astm.org/Standards/E1439.htm and, e.g.,
http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00128-015-1474-z). In some amphibian species, sex
determination is influenced by higher temperatures and other environmental factors (reviewed
by https://hal.inria.fr/file/index/docid/900509/filename/hal-00900509.pdf). But I don't think
that there is any evidence that different nutrient (salt) conditions can affect sex termination?!
However, two concerns that must be discussed (later in the discussion) is that individuals were
euthanized with beginning of metamorphosis (Gosner stage 42) and not at completed
metamorphosis (see below) and that sex termination was done without histological examination
(give proper citation for this method and clarify in the method part of the supplementary
material).
Results
The results are clearly presented and details can be found in the supplementary material.
Discussion
It has to be noted and discussed that sex differentiation can occur in some anurans during
metamorphosis, i.e. the final sex is only seen at Gosner stage 46 (completed metamorphosis)
(reviewed by https://hal.inria.fr/file/index/docid/900509/filename/hal-00900509.pdf and see
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400520203/pdf).

L. 140: which two studies?
L. 147: It has to be noted that Schmidt et al. (2012) found that the effects of date of and size at
metamorphosis on different juvenile traits cancelled each other out such that toads that were
small or large at metamorphosis had equal performance
(https://homepage.univie.ac.at/walter.hoedl/Schmidt_etal_Ecology_2012.pdf)

This manuscript, by Max Lambert, entitled “Clover root exudate produces male-biased sex ratios
and accelerates male metamorphic timing in wood frogs” provides interesting and novel
experimental data. As indicated by the title, the author tested the effects of clover root exudate
on wood frog gonadal differentiation (sex ratio) and metamorphic timing. This is a useful study
that contributes new information about how plant-based compounds might impact endocrine
function in animals.
That said, I recommend that the author increase the detail presented in the methods section. Data
in Fig. 4 would be better presented using box plots rather than histograms. Finally, the
discussion (and maybe introduction) would be greatly strengthened by adding information about
the endocrine mechanisms underlying wood frog gonadal development, which endocrine-active
plant compounds are found in clover, and in what ways those clover compounds are known to
interact with animal physiology – as estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists, as androgens…etc.
This is an interesting study. Thank you for the opportunity to provide a review. Detailed
suggestions are below.

Abstract
Line 28 – you indicate that exposure to exudates accelerates male metamorphosis relative to
females – but not at all doses if I understand your results. So, you could increase the accuracy of
your abstract with a more specific statement of the results.
Introduction
Line 35 – I would add pharmaceuticals in addition to pesticides and wastewater contaminants
(which do include pharmaceuticals).
Line 58 – It would be helpful to summarize here the nature of phytoestrogen diversity reported in
your earlier study. What compounds were measured, which ones were found – how did those
compare to other sites that you considered less diverse with regard to phytoestrogens.
Line 59 – instead of saying the sex ratios are deviant, it would be more informative to say they
were male-biased or female-biased and to what degree. The term “deviant” feels odd in this
context, since it usually is used to describe behavior, rather than morphology. You could also say
that sex ratios deviate from the expected 1:1 – if that is what would be expected for the frogs in
your previous study.
Line 60 – add details about the correlation – which direction did it go?
Line 63 – be more specific than “somatic development” – what exactly did you measure? Time to
metamorphosis in this case.
Line 66 – delete “itself” from the end of the sentence.
I would add some information about which isoflavonoids/phytoestrogens are found in clover
roots.
Methods
Line 70 – the densities should be expressed per square cm area of water surface or similar.
Please add information on the following. How did you germinate the seeds? What hydroponic
media did you use? If you added fertilizer – how much, how often? How did you support the
seeds in the water while they germinated and grew? (the photo is very helpful). What was your
light source (bulb type if applicable)? Did you use a greenhouse, growth chambers, or the
outdoors? What temperature did you grow the clover at, and what was the photoperiod? Did all
the seeds germinate? What volume of water did you use for growing the seedlings?
How did you extract root exudate – how long did it take and in what volume of water? Was the
exudate extracted from living roots or ground up roots…? Were the plants getting older as the
study progressed? Were they always vegetative? How many batches of exudate did you
produce that were then pooled? What material were the hydroponic containers made from?
(looks like glass from the photo). Were the extracts collected in the hydroponic containers? How
big were the containers? I’m especially asking because certain types of plastics leach estrogens.
Line 75 – how many tadpoles were placed in each treatment?
Line 77 – what size were the glass jars? How was the DI water reconstituted (with what?)
Line 78 – what was the treatment solution – how was it related to the exudate collections? How
was it created, what was in it? How much treatment solution did you add to each jar? Did you
make any dilutions? Was the treatment solution taken straight from the hydroponic containers?
5
Was there any fertilizer or other hydroponic media ingredients in the treatment solution? Was
the solution stored at all? If it was stored – how and for how long?
Line 79 – what brand/type of feed did you give the tadpoles? Give enough information that
someone could go to the store and buy the same thing. What was in the food if not alfalfa, which
is the most common ingredient in rabbit chow.
Line 82 and Fig. 2. The picture of the ovaries and testes look similar except they are colored
slightly differently (possibly due to lighting differences) and the ovaries are slightly bigger. What
characteristics did you use to distinguish the male vs. female gonads? Also, the red arrows are
pointing to the tops of the gonads. I’m not familiar with wood frog sexual development, but if it
is like Xenopus, the gonads are differentiated at metamorphosis. To me, the paired gonads are
the full length of whitish tissue in the photos, not just the top. Can you clarify and explain which
part of the photographed tissue is gonadal, and what the rest is. A scale bar on each photo would
also be useful.
Results
Line 88 – I’m guessing you mean specimens of the metamorphs (not the clover). Did you catalog
individuals from each treatment? What is the benefit of the cataloging?
Line 96 and elsewhere – I don’t think you need to capitalize low, high, medium, or control when
referring to the treatments. The statistical value “p” also should not be capitalized - should be (p
= 0.05).
Fig. 4. In the figure description, please indicate what comparisons the p-values refer to.
The most interesting question here is - did the different concentrations of clover exudate change
metamorphic timing? I think you are right to separate the sexes. The differences between the
sexes within treatments is an interesting secondary question.
So, another way to show the data is as a line graph showing mean number of days to
metamorphosis for each treatment for males and females. So the x-axis is treatment and the y-
axis is mean days to metamorphosis. You could use box plots to more readily demonstrate the
variance and outliers around the means and use various symbols to show where the significant
differences are. Differences among means could be analyzed with ANOVA.
Fig. 4 as presented is hard to digest because the patterns are difficult to see.
Discussion
Line 116 – remove comma after “many legumes”.
I don’t know much about wood frogs. Is their gonadal differentiation determined by estrogens
and androgens? I think the discussion could be expanded with some information about the
control of gonadal differentiation in wood frogs, as it relates to the hormonal context, and then
connect that to the potential for endocrine disruption by phytoestrogens.
There are also phytoandrogens (as you note) – possibly clover has them. You’ve cited a paper
about a plant that is not a legume – did you check for androgens in legumes, which would be
more relevant. (There are also several papers about paper mill effluent, which contains an
androgenic compound from pine trees that masculinizes mosquitofish anal fins, which are
sexually dimorphic.)
6
Additionally, some environmental estrogens block the estrogen receptor and this could be the
case for some of the clover phytoestrogens. Your discussion would be stronger if you delved
more into the mechanistic details involved in the effects you observed.
Line 132. You note that “The physiological impact of plant chemicals on vertebrate sexual
development may also vary between plant species [24].” This is of course a true statement. It’s
not all the useful though because it is too general. Also, it’s not clear what plant species you have
in mind to compare.
You go on to say that “The results here indicate that developing an understanding
of how different plant species impact the physiology and development of animals will be a
fruitful research direction.” This is true too, but also too general. Readers might interpret this as
a statement on your part that no research has ever been done in this area of plant-animal
interactions. Of course, you do not mean this, because there is a large body of work on plant-
animal interactions.
I think you could make more specific statements describing future research needs. For example,
we do need to better understand the chemical cocktails that are exuded by the roots of legumes,
which are traditionally held to be estrogenic. It makes me wonder where the idea first came
from. How was “estrogenicity” of legumes first observed? We also need to better understand
how these cocktails interact with an animal’s physiology to create the sum of the animal’s final
phenotype at the point of sampling. What’s more, the effects of plant chemicals are probably
affected by other environmental factors and by the animal’s developmental stage. It could even
be that root exudates are estrogenic in the gonad, but androgenic in the brain – how that would
manifest would be interesting to see!
Line 136 – there is a great paper by Ji et al., 2007. Genistein Prevents Thyroid Hormone-
Dependent Tail Regression of Rana catesbeiana Tadpoles by Targetting Protein
Kinase C and Thyroid Hormone Receptor. DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS 236:777–790. The
paper shows that genistein could potentially delay metamorphosis. This is a useful reference for
your paper.
Line 144. You note that it is not known if “developmental rates differ among sexes in wild
populations. Is this definitely the case? It seems like this would have been measured at least for
some amphibian species.

This is an interesting study on the effects of phytoestrogenic root exudates on vertebrate
development.
I have found three points:
(1) One concern that must be discussed is that individuals were euthanized with beginning of
metamorphosis (Gosner stage 42) and not at completed metamorphosis (see below).
(2) The author must give a proper citation and explanation how to sex individuals without
histological examination!
(3) Another concern might be that there is no measurements of chemical compounds for quality
assurance (see below).
All in all, I recommend minor revision because of the overall value of the manuscript and because
I am aware that at least two out of these concerns (perhaps to early termination of the experiment
and measurements for quality assurance) cannot be subsequently done (the experiments are over)
and I think that it is adequate to discuss them and possible effects on the results in the present
manuscript.

Introduction
The introduction aims to highlight the main question/problem of endocrine disrupting natural
chemicals (here, phytoestrogens). All relevant literature has been considered. L. 63 Rana sylvatica
is now placed into the genus Lithobates (L. sylvaticus)
Methods
Are the phytoestrogenic root exudates (i.e. the chemical compounds) from red clover known and
- most important - measurable? If yes, why they have not been measured for quality assurance?
Please clarify in the text (here or in the discussion).
Using one egg clutch would ensure to test only siblings, but I suggest that randomly selected
individuals from two clutches (from one population) have not significantly influenced the results.
From the supplementray material, I am aware that 40 individuals were used per treatment?! I
think the number of individually maintained tadpoles per treatment should be stated in the
manuscript.
Only 0.06 g aquarium salt per liter of distilled water was added to maintain osmolarity. Many
other amphibian toxicological studies using embryos or early larvae used FETAX-solution, i.e.
distilled water with a defined amount of different nutrient salts added (see
http://www.astm.org/Standards/E1439.htm and, e.g.,
http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00128-015-1474-z). In some amphibian species, sex
determination is influenced by higher temperatures and other environmental factors (reviewed
by https://hal.inria.fr/file/index/docid/900509/filename/hal-00900509.pdf). But I don't think
that there is any evidence that different nutrient (salt) conditions can affect sex termination?!
However, two concerns that must be discussed (later in the discussion) is that individuals were
euthanized with beginning of metamorphosis (Gosner stage 42) and not at completed
metamorphosis (see below) and that sex termination was done without histological examination
(give proper citation for this method and clarify in the method part of the supplementary
material).
Results
The results are clearly presented and details can be found in the supplementary material.
Discussion
It has to be noted and discussed that sex differentiation can occur in some anurans during
metamorphosis, i.e. the final sex is only seen at Gosner stage 46 (completed metamorphosis)
(reviewed by https://hal.inria.fr/file/index/docid/900509/filename/hal-00900509.pdf and see
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400520203/pdf).

from. How was “estrogenicity” of legumes first observed? We also need to better understand
how these cocktails interact with an animal’s physiology to create the sum of the animal’s final
phenotype at the point of sampling. What’s more, the effects of plant chemicals are probably
affected by other environmental factors and by the animal’s developmental stage. It could even
be that root exudates are estrogenic in the gonad, but androgenic in the brain – how that would
manifest would be interesting to see!

Abstract: In amphibians, abnormal metamorph sex ratios and sexual development have almost
exclusively been considered in response to synthetic compounds like pesticides or
pharmaceuticals. However, endocrine-active plant chemicals (i.e., phytoestrogens) are commonly
found in agricultural and urban waterways hosting frog populations with deviant sexual
development. Yet the effects of these compounds on amphibian development remain
predominantly unexplored. Legumes, like clover, are common in agricultural fields and urban
yards and exude phytoestrogen mixtures from their roots. These root exudates serve important
ecological functions and may also be a source of phytoestrogens in waterways. I show that clover
root exudate produces male-biased sex ratios and accelerates male metamorphosis relative to
females. My results indicate that root exudates are a potential source of contaminants impacting
vertebrate development and that humans may be cultivating sexual abnormalities in wildlife by
actively managing certain plant species.

Dr. Ferrier,
reciate the opportunity to resubmit my manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. As you
d, both reviewers found this manuscript interesting and I hope I have done a sufficient job at
essing their comments.
neral, I found the reviewers’ comments to be positive as well as insightful and helpful. In
st every instance I addressed the comments as suggested. In a few instances, I argue to keep
iscussion as it was currently written, or with minor changes, to keep the manuscript brief and
ise.
y comments from Reviewer 2 (Dr. Edwards) dealt with details about methods and results. All
nswers to these, detailed in my responses below, were in the supplementary materials which
have been obscured from the reviewer. To remedy this, I have eliminated my supplementary
ods and moved all detail about methods and results into the main text of the manuscript to
the study more clear. I have also taken Dr. Edwards’ suggestions for making Figures 2 and 4
clear.
comments from the reviewers are below with my responses in bold text.
k forward to yours and the journal’s response to my revisions.

of the arguments I make in my introduction is that the chemical milieu in the root

e this more obvious in my introduction. However, there are likely many different
icals in clover root exudate that we are currently unaware of and we currently do not
whether these chemicals may exert a stronger hormonal effect than the chemicals we
ently know something about. This is one of the reasons I chose not to directly measure
idual compounds in the exudate. I believe it could be misleading to discuss
entrations of certain chemicals in different clover seedling densities rather than just

is case, I disagree. The seedlings were all germinated in the same size jars and in the
volume of water. Because the exudate was later diluted, the density of seedlings per unit
ater surface area may not be particularly descriptive. Here my goal was to create
able low, medium, and high dose treatments that are relative to each other.

oors? What temperature did you grow the clover at, and what was the photoperiod? Did all the
germinate? What volume of water did you use for growing the seedlings?
did you extract root exudate – how long did it take and in what volume of water? Was the
ate extracted from living roots or ground up roots…? Were the plants getting older as the
progressed? Were they always vegetative? How many batches of exudate did you produce
were then pooled? What material were the hydroponic containers made from? (looks like glass

iners? I’m especially asking because certain types of plastics leach estrogens.

77 – what size were the glass jars? How was the DI water reconstituted (with what?)
78 – what was the treatment solution – how was it related to the exudate collections? How

e are also phytoandrogens (as you note) – possibly clover has them. You’ve cited a paper
t a plant that is not a legume – did you check for androgens in legumes, which would be more

ound from pine trees that masculinizes mosquitofish anal fins, which are sexually dimorphic.)

se as the general belief is that isoflavones and coumestins are estrogenic. The idea that
toestrogens” may be more androgenic is a newer idea that runs counter to what is often
ved. At this time there isn’t anything I can add about phytoandrogens in legumes.
he paper mill effluent information, my understanding is that the compounds in the pine
selves are not androgenic per se. Rather it is microbial transformation of the pine
icals that produces androgens. Regardless, I hope to keep this manuscript concise and
mize delving too deep into a discussion on phytoandrogens until more data is available. I
er to keep this section of the discussion as it is.
tionally, some environmental estrogens block the estrogen receptor and this could be the case
ome of the clover phytoestrogens. Your discussion would be stronger if you delved more into
echanistic details involved in the effects you observed.

132. You note that “The physiological impact of plant chemicals on vertebrate sexual
lopment may also vary between plant species [24].” This is of course a true statement. It’s not
e useful though because it is too general. Also, it’s not clear what plant species you have in
to compare.
Hermelink et al. paper here looked at in vitro agonistic and antagonistic effects of several
t species’ leaf litter leachate. To my knowledge this is one of the few papers taking a
parative approach across plant species to look at the effects of a plant chemical mixtures.
point of my statement is to encourage more research of this sort on different plant species
far as I can tell there is currently little known to this effect. The generality of the
ment indicates how little is currently known.
e tried to clarify this area of the discussion.
go on to say that “The results here indicate that developing an understanding
w different plant species impact the physiology and development of animals will be a
ul research direction.” This is true too, but also too general. Readers might interpret this as a
ment on your part that no research has ever been done in this area of plant-animal
actions. Of course, you do not mean this, because there is a large body of work on plant-animal
actions.
