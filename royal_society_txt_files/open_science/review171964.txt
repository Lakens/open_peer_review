Comments to the Author:
A more substantial quantity of results in terms of the papers treated and subsequent
analysis/comparison of the effects is needed. The QSPR studies identified in the title are not
included in the main body of the paper. A key feature of security paper is also durability, of the
fluorescent marker and the effects on the underlying paper, neither of which has been examined.
Suggested rationalisations should be experimentally evaluated. The abstract in its current form is
non-standard and inappropriate. While individual words within the text make sense, whole
sentences, in numerous cases, do not. Text is cumbersome in other places and substantially
detracts from the science. Inappropriate use of contractions in figures, spectra not of high enough
resolution. ESI should be provided as a single document.

In this manuscript, the authors describe the synthesis of a series of fluorinated pyrazolines, the
QSPR study of the correlation of the fluorescence quantum yield with the structural descriptors
and the application of the most efficient dyes as fluorescent marker for paper sheets. I find the
study interesting, clear and suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science after some
minor revisions:
1. The first sentence of the introduction should be improved to make it clearer. Example,
“application in various fields such as medicine, dyes, fluorescent labeling, biological detectors,
cosmic-ray detection, and most commonly, fluorescent lamps, as well as quantum dots and
security maker for safety documents”. Detectors, documents and lamps are objects, not fields.
2. The references 2, 3, 5, 13, 14, 31 are not relevant.
3. The works cited under ref. 16 and 17 are the same.
4. Please avoid excessive self-citations especially when talking about general concepts, such as
organic and inorganic dyes (references 6 and 7) or AM1 technique (ref. 40-47).
5. Page 2, “Generally, the inorganic-based fluorescence compounds are zinc sulfide or cadmium
sulfide”. I do not agree. What about silica nanoparticles, carbon dots, upconversion nanoparticles,
gold or silver nanoparticles, etc?
6. Page 2, “These compounds have mild toxicity and low quantum efficiency.” Please, provide a
citation to the statement. I would say these compounds are characterized by high toxicity.
7. Page 2, “Most of the fluorescence active-compounds are excited in the near ultraviolet region

1. Page 2, “Most of the organic-based fluorescence active-compounds are excited in the near
ultraviolet region (300-420 nm).” I cannot agree with this statement neither. You can easily find
organic-based fluorescent compounds excitable in the visible, red and near-infrared region.
Please remove this sentence; it will have no influence on the logic of the introduction.
2. Page 2, “These properties make them accessible for many applications including
photoconductive and emitting materials,9,10” Ref. 9 is not relevant, it does not refer to
photoconductive or emitting materials.

Dear Dr. Anthony Stace (Editor of Royal Society Open Science)
First, I would like to acknowledge your help and those of the Ass. Editor Dr Patricia and Dr. Siobhán
Hackett, to improve our Ms. We sincerely believe that your feedback improved our manuscript. We really
appreciated it and we have taken into account your remarks accordingly.
*The QSPR studies identified in the title are not included in the main body of the paper.
Answer: We have added it, please check sub-titles 2.2. & 3.2, in the resubmitted text. Data related to
QSPR studies are illustrated in Tables 2 & 3, and Fig. 2. With thanks.
* The abstract in its current form is non-standard and inappropriate.
Answer: Thank you, I think the modified abstract is summarized the novel achievements in this
submitted articles.
* A key feature of security paper is also durability, of the fluorescent marker and the effects on the
underlying paper, neither of which has been examined. Suggested rationalisations should be
experimentally evaluated.
Answer: Thank you again for providing us instructive suggestions. We agree about your view, But as you
noticed. This article is Pt. I. and we concerned on synthesizing and evaluating the fluorescence behavior
of novel fluorescence active fluorinated-pyrazolines. Moreover, for recommending they behavior as
security marker in production of safety documents, we must confirm about they have nothing any
deterioration effect on paper strength. This evaluation also included in this submitted article, and in the
forthcoming part; Pt. II (LORD willing), they behavior as security markers towards counterfeiting and
forgery purposes, as well as the resistance of treated paper to erasure, and ageing will be examined in
detail
* Inappropriate use of contractions in figures, spectra not of high enough resolution. ESI should be
provided as a single document.
Answer: Thank you, we combined the 5 files related to supplementary materials in one file, as pdf
(because it s v. large, and May I can’t download it in word version.
I know the charts related to FT-IR spectra not in high resolution, as we scanned the charts received from
service Lab. at NRC, and the printing ink in these original not good.
I included it in supplementary material only to support the strs. of the synthesized novel active
fluorinated-pyrazolines, if the Reviewers’ need to confirm about it.
Once again, we thank both editor and associate editor for their positive and constructive comments. We
tried our best to improve the manuscript and we hope that the correction will meet with approval.

Girgis et al., Manuscript Number: RSOS-170902, for potential publication in the Royal
Society Open Science.
This manuscript shows the synthesis of novel fluorescence active 2-pyrazolines and
application Pt.I. I've the following to say:
Many thanks for your efforts and providing us instructive suggestions
Comments:
1. The abbreviation "Pt.I." in the "Title" should be avoided.
Answer
Thank you again, but I would like to clear you that I reported this work as part 1.,
because now we’re undertaken on preparing another article dealing the utilization of
such fluorescence compunds in production of safety documents, moreover for trial to
translate the imbedded data from the printer used to visible information's can be tracked
under the UV. Lamp. This will facilitate to detect any forage crime take on value
documents. Based on your comment I canceled Pt.I. from title.
2. The manuscript has many grammatical mistakes and thereby the text shall thoroughly
be checked for language with the help of a native English speaker.
Answer
We checked the language in all text, and the corrected words are highlighted in grey
color, I'm so sorry about it.
3. The mathematical expression for the fluorescence spectra and molecular descriptors
should be rewritten by MathType.
Answer
We are sorry for these mistake and conceptual confusion. May the conversion of text
from word 2007 to 2003 made this problem (view the equations as Figs.). In revised
version I saved it as word 2007.
4. In order to be publishable, three-dimensional quantitative structure-property
relationship (3D-QSPR) models must be constructed in this work.
Answer
Thank you for providing us instructive suggestion, but the software adopted for this
study (CODESSA Pro) is 2D- QSPR, only available for us, and software for 3D-
QSPR is not available in our lab. (or Institute), and it s difficult to have or purchased
the 3D-QSPR softwar in this period. Please forgive me as we can’t. Believe me this
out of my hand.
5. All the Figures and Tables in this manuscripts are low quality.
Answer
We know the Figures in supplementary file dealing the FT-IR and 1H NMR are not
good, as we scanned the original spectra as received from service Lab, and the printing
ink in these original not good. I included these Figs. in supplementary material only to
confirm about our results and support the strs. of the synthesized novel active
fluorinated-pyrazolines ( if the Reviewers’ need to confirm about it).
We try to improve all Figs. & Tables reported in Manuscript and supplementary files, by
increasing the contrast, Thank you.
6. The number of "Reference" should be condensed.
Answer
Based on your comment & Reviewer 2 asked, the No. of References are reduced to
become 33 instead of 48.
7. The procedures of organic synthesis is too tedious, and some parts should be moved
to the part of "Supporting Information".
Answer
The Methods of synthesizing fluorescence pyrazolines 13-33. are transferred to
Supplementary file, with thanks.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, the authors describe the synthesis of a series of fluorinated
pyrazolines, the QSPR study of the correlation of the fluorescence quantum yield with
the structural descriptors and the application of the most efficient dyes as fluorescent
marker for paper sheets. I find the study interesting, clear and suitable for publication
in Royal Society Open Science after some minor revisions:
Many thanks for you decision and providing us instructive suggestions
1. The first sentence of the introduction should be improved to make it clearer. Example,
“application in various fields such as medicine, dyes, fluorescent labeling, biological
detectors, cosmic-ray detection, and most commonly, fluorescent lamps, as well as
quantum dots and security maker for safety documents”. Detectors, documents and
lamps are objects, not fields.
Answer
We are so sorry for this mistake and conceptual confusion. We have carefully corrected
it through the revised version, and further highlighted in grey color,
2. The references 2, 3, 5, 13, 14, 31 are not relevant.
Answer
We deleted these References in the revised article, with thanks
3. The works cited under ref. 16 and 17 are the same.
Answer
Please forgive me about this wrong, I checked it. Because the work in Ref. 17
continuation to the Res. 16, and the Reviewer 1 asked to reduce the No. of Refs.,
therefore we canceled Ref. # 16. Thank you
4. Please avoid excessive self-citations especially when talking about general concepts,
such as organic and inorganic dyes (references 6 and 7) or AM1 technique (ref. 40-
47).

Thank you, but I would like to clear you that we cited some of our References related
to subject of presented article, till we clear there is no repetition with other previous
publications. In the revised article we only preserved the more recent References
(Ref. 7, 41 & 46).
5. Page 2, “Generally, the inorganic-based fluorescence compounds are zinc sulfide or
cadmium sulfide”. I do not agree. What about silica nanoparticles, carbon dots,
upconversion nanoparticles, gold or silver nanoparticles, etc?
Answer
Thank you again for this comment, I included these fluorescence nanoparticles in
text, introduction section, and replaced Ref. # 12 (in revised version, after deleting
some Refs. it will become Ref. # 8) by the following Reference;
O. S. Wolfbeis, An overview of nanoparticles commonly used in fluorescent
bioimaging, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2015, 44, 4743-4768.
6. Page 2, “These compounds have mild toxicity and low quantum efficiency.” Please,
provide a citation to the statement. I would say these compounds are characterized
by high toxicity.
Answer
I agree about your view, as I rember I reported it based on cited articles related to
CdSe quantum-dot, National Academies Press and National Research Council
(US). In revised text I corrected it, with thanks.
7. Page 2, “Most of the fluorescence active-compounds are excited in the near
ultraviolet region (300-420 nm) “. I do not agree, there are numerous inorganic
fluorophores that could be excited in the red part of the spectrum (ex. quantum dots,
upconversion nanoparticles).
Answer
Thank you, I agree about your reported, with thanks, therefore we added the word
most of the fluorescence…. . In the revised version we corrected this sentence to
become “Most of the organic-based fluorescence active-compounds are excited in the
near ultraviolet region (300-420 nm)”.
8. Page 3, “Interest in these analogues is attributed to the unique properties of fluorine
containing-compounds as thermal stability and lipophilicity.” I did not find any data
on fluorine containing compounds in the cited paper (N. Louhichi, A. Houas, N.B.
Hamadi and M. Msaddek, Synthesis and chemistry of new spiro-<U+0394>1-pyrazoline, J.
Heterocyclic Chem., 2012, 49; 267-271.).
Answer
I’m so sorry about it, in the revised version I included the corrected Ref. (L. Siva
Sanker Reddy*, T. Rajkumar, K. Jyothi and Y. Siva Rami Reddy,
Synthesis, characterization and anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory activities of
some novel chalcones and 1,3,5-trisubstituted pyrazolines. Der Pharmacia Sinica, 2015,
6(4),73-82.). This Ref. will be Ref. # 22 in revised version)
with many thanks for your efforts.
9. Experimental part: please provide 13C NMR spectra for all the compounds.
Answer
Thank you v. much for providing us instructive suggestions. But we would like to clear
you that, because the 13CNMR instrument not available in my Institute, as you noticed in
original submitted article (Last text file, Research Ethics section, the funding of this
work is self-employed from all authors). Therefore, this analysis was carried on the on
promising fluorescence compounds, at Chem. Dept, Cairo Univ.
I hope you response with our situation.
I think, in original article, page # 4, line #55, we reported the information’s dealing the
Instrument used. In Expt. section, sub.title 2.1. we modified it to become “13C-NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend 400/R (100 MHz) spectrometer, This analysis
was only tested for four promising compounds with greatest <U+0424>s (13, 15,18 and 23)”.
with thanks.
10. Page 12: Please use “absorption spectra” instead of “UV-vis spectra”.
Answer
We corrected it in revised version, subtitle: 3.2.1, with thanks
11. Page 16: Please indicate the correspondence between the names SF1-5, SB1-5 and
the compounds 13,15,18,19,23.
Answer
We illustrated it in revised Figures (Figs 3 a& b), with thanks
Once again, we thank both editor and associate editor for their positive and
constructive comments. We tried our best to improve the manuscript and we hope that
the correction will meet with approval.
Please forgive me for delay in reply.

Reviewer #2
Comments to the Author(s)
I am mostly satisfied with the corrections made by the authors and I recommend the study for
publication in Royal Society Open Science after few additional corrections of the
introduction:
1. Page 2, “Most of the organic-based fluorescence active-compounds are excited in the
near ultraviolet region (300-420 nm).” I cannot agree with this statement neither. You can
easily find organic-based fluorescent compounds excitable in the visible, red and near-
infrared region. Please remove this sentence; it will have no influence on the logic of the
introduction.
Answer
Many thanks for your decision and your patience. As your advice we deleted this sentence.
2. Page 2, “These properties make them accessible for many applications including
photoconductive and emitting materials,9,10” Ref. 9 is not relevant, it does not refer to
photoconductive or emitting materials.
Answer
I corrected it to reported only Ref. 10, I’m extremely soeey for this wrong, with thanks.
3. Page 3, “For forgery purposes, safety paper must be performed durability, and included
safety marker resistance to forgery and counterfeiting.6, 13-20” Ref. 6 is not relevant, it does
not refer to safety marker resistance to forgery and counterfeiting.
Answer
Thank you, The correct Refs. related to this sentence are Ref. 13 and 21, I’m already made
this correction in text, with many thanks again.
4. Page 3, “Interest in these analogues is attributed to the unique properties of fluorine
containing-compounds as thermal stability and lipophilicity.” I did not find information about
the exceptional thermal stability and lipophilicity of fluorine containing compounds in the
cited paper (K.I. Bhat, M.K.S. Chauhan, A. Kumar and P. Kumar,, Synthesis,
pharmacological, and biological screening of novel derivatives of benzodiazepines, J.
Heterocyclic Chem., 2014, 51, 1189-1192.) Please, rephrase or provide a relevant citation.
Answer
We replaced the reorted Ref. 26 by the following ref. with thanks
S.Y. Jadhav, R. B. Bhosale, “Pyrazole Chemistry Synthesis and Medicinal Applications”,
Publisher, Lulu.com. ISBN, 1365756769, 9781365756764. Feb., 2017,
Once again, we thank both editor and reviewers for their positive and
constructive comments. We hope that the correction will meet with approval.
Please forgive me again for delay in reply.
