The study investigated bacterial and fungal communities in root and rhizosphere of healthy and
diseased soybean plants, affected by root-knot nematodes, in two rows of a field. Several OTU
were identified that preferentially occurred on healthy or affected plants, and their connections in
microbe-microbe networks described. The experimental design was very good. The data are well
presented and conclusions supported by the data. I suggest to better discuss the underlying
mechanisms or consequences of preferential occurrence of OTU. Those OTU on healthy plants
might indicate their role in protecting the plant from nematode attack. Preferential OTU on
diseased plants might live on the nematodes (following nematode population dynamics but not
controlling it), or simply profit from resource leakage of diseased roots.

This paper dealt with relationship between microbial communities in rhizosphere and root of
soybean plants and the infection by root-knot nematodes. Interestingly, authors sampling the
soybean individual in the one field plot and separate the soybean individuals into three groups
(normal, yellow and no leaf) corresponding to the infection of root-knot nematodes. Overall, the
manuscript is well-written, methods and results are well presented and conclusions are fully
justified.
However, the significantly weaknesses are that there were no any data on the nematode
infections. It is quite easy to measure the root-knot index, which is quite necessary to explain how
serious of the plants infected by nematode. Moreover, the infection of the nematodes (secondary-
stage juveniles) occurred in the seedling stage of the plants. However, sampling was conducted at
the late stage of the soybean. It is quite hard to correlate the microbes in the rhizosphere soil and
roots to the nematode damaging. Although there are some relationships between some
nematophagous microbes previously reported and nematode damaging, most of those microbes
could survive as saprophytes in the soil. The other key issue is that root-knot nematode is kind of
animals and many microbes can colonize on the different stages of root-knot nematode.
However, there was no any examination on the microbial community on nematode.
Following are some recent papers that may have reference value to help promote the significance
of this manuscript:
The analysis of rhizosphere microbial communities during an invasion by Ralstonia
solanacearum (Wei et al., Ralstonia solanacearum pathogen disrupts bacterial rhizosphere
microbiome during an invasion, 2018), besides, the results on rhizosphere, root and cyst microbial
communities in disease suppressive soil provide more insights into consortia of anti-nematode
bacteria (Hussain et al., Bacterial community assemblages in the rhizosphere soil, root
endosphere and cyst of soybean cyst nematode-suppressive soil challenged with nematodes,
2018).

I thought the overall science was sound, and the paper provides an interesting insight into the
correlation between plant health, root-knot nematode colonization, and corresponding
recruitment of nematophagous fungi and nematocidal bacteria to the root and rhizosphere. The
paper makes a sound contribution to the literature on these complex interactions, and the authors
are careful not to overinterpret their results. The only issue I found with the article was some
minor formatting issues and some substantive grammatical concerns especially in the Summary,
Introduction, and Discussion sections. These concerns are described in the attached review file

The manuscript is acceptable except a minor comment. Actually Dactylellina is trapping fungus
and can capture secondary-stage juveniles and Clonostachys, Pochonia and Purpureocillium can
parasitize on nematode eggs. Those fungi associated with no-leaf individuals of soybean, that
means high nematode densities in no-leaf individuals can stimulate the multiply of those fungi.
Authors may discuss this point a little bit.

Review for RSOS root-knot nematode paper
Formatting concerns.
1) Figure and Table notations should be consistent throughout – I would
suggest Bold, written out. For supplementary data/figures, these can
just be labeled “Figure Sx” rather than redundantly labeling them
“electronic supplementary material, Figure Sx”
2) The sections labeled Ethics, Data Accessibility, etc. These should be
bolded
3) Tables should be rotated so the text can be big enough to read.
Tables 2-4. Alternatively just use the most specific classification for
the identified OTU (perhaps labeled with (P/O/F/C/G to clarify), to
make the table easier to read. Also separate tables for Green and No
Leaf associated OTUs would be clearer
4) The primers used for sequencing and amplification should be put in a
Table, and the Tables in the paper should be renumbered.
Writing concerns.
The writing is generally clear, but there are a few bad habits that make for
difficult reading. The most pervasive is the use of words like “However”,
“Overall”, and “Therefore” to start sentences. In most cases these words can
be removed without changing the meaning of the text. There are also
several instances of run on sentences using several commas to delineate
clauses that could be broken up into separate sentences. This is largely in the
Summary, Introduction, and to a lesser extent in the discussion. Almost
everywhere in the text where a sentence starts with a short clause followed
by a comma, this clause can be removed or place at the end of the sentence
to make the writing clearer.
A specific concern in the discussion is that the preference analysis used to
suggest that certain microbes are preferentially found on the roots of the
diseased plants, but no quantitative data is provided (in other words, how
much more prevalent is Pseudomonas in the “no leaf” rhizosphere?). Similar
analysis on each of the OTUs found to have a preference could shed
additional light on the magnitude of the effect of disease.
The discussion is pretty good,but a little long. The network analysis is
discussed a lot, and I think lengthy discussion of the nematicidal properties of
various organisms can be cut, considering that you don’t know if these
specific organisms are present (only organisms in the same genus).

22 Summary.
23 Cyst and root-knot nematodes are major risk factors of agroecosystem management, often
24 causing devastating impacts on crop production. The use of microbes that parasitize or prey
25 on nematodes has been considered as a promising approach for suppressing phytopathogenic
26 nematode populations. However, as effects and persistence of those biological control agents
27 often vary substantially depending on regions, soil characteristics, and agricultural practices, :
28 mmore ore insights into microbial community processes are required to develop reproducible
29 control of nematode populations. By performing high-throughput sequencing profiling of
30 bacteria and fungi, we examined how root and soil microbiomes differ between benign and
31 nematode-infected plant individuals in a soybean field in Japan. Results indicated that various
32 taxonomic groups of bacteria and fungi occurred preferentially on the soybean individuals
33 infected by root-knot nematodes or those uninfected by nematodes. Based on a network
34 analysis of potential microbe–microbe associations, we further found that several fungal taxa
35 potentially preying on nematodes [Dactylellina (Orbiliales), Rhizophydium (Rhizophydiales),
36 Clonostachys (Hypocreales), Pochonia (Hypocreales), and Purpureocillium (Hypocreales)]
37 co-occurred in the soybean rhizosphere at a small spatial scale. Overall, tThis study suggests
38 how “consortia” of anti-nematode microbes can derive from indigenous (resident)
39 microbiomes, thereby providing basic information for managing anti-nematode microbial
40 communities in agroecosystems.

43 1. Introduction
44 Plant pathogenic nematodes, such as cyst and root-knot nematodes, are major threats to crop
45 production worldwide [1, 2]. Soybean fields, in particular, are often damaged by such
46 phytopathogenic nematodes, resulting in substantial yield loss [3, 4]. A number of chemical
47 nematicides and biological control agents (e.g., nematophagous fungi in the genera
48 Purpureocillium and Clonostachys) have been used to suppress nematode populations in
49 farmlands [5, 6]. However, once cyst and root-knot nematodes appear in a farmland, they
50 often persist in the soil for a long time [7], causing high financial costs in agricultural
51 management. Therefore, fFinding ways to suppress pathogenic nematode populations in
52 agroecosystems is a key to reducing risk and management costs in production of soybean and
53 other crop plants.
54 To reduce damage by cyst and root-knot nematodes, a number of studies have evaluated
55 effects of crop varieties/species, crop rotations, fertilizer inputs, and tillage intensity on
56 nematode density in farmland soil [1, 8-10]. However, the results of those studies varied
57 considerably depending on regions, soil characteristics, and complicated interactions among
58 multiple factors (e.g., interactions between organic matter inputs and tillage frequency) [11].
59 ThereforeThus, it remains an important challenge to understand the mechanisms by which
60 phytopathogenic nematode populations are suppressed in some farmland soils but not in
61 others [12]. New lines of information are required for building general schemes for making
62 agroecosystems robust to the emergence of pest nematodes.
63 Based on the technological advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing, more and
64 more studies have examined structures of microbial communities (microbiomes) in order to
65 evaluate biotic environmental conditions in the endosphere and rhizosphere of plants [13-16].
66 Indeed, rRecent studies have uncovered microbiome compositions of “disease suppressive
67 soils”, in which pests and pathogens damaging crop plants have been suppressed for long
68 periods of time [17-19]. Some studies have further discussed how some microbes within such
69 disease-suppressive microbiomes contribute to health and growth of crop plant species [17,
70 20, 21]. In one of the studies, soil microbiome compositions were compared among soybean
3
71 fields that differed in the density of cyst nematodes [12]. The study then revealed that bacteria
72 and fungi potentially having negative impacts on nematode populations (e.g., Purpureocillium
73 and Pochonia) were more abundant in long-term than in short-term monoculture fields of
74 soybeans [12]. While sSuch among-farmland comparisons have provided invaluable insights
75 into ecosystem functions of indigenous (native) microbiomes. Nonetheless, potential
76 relationship between cropping system management and community processes of anti-
77 nematode microbes remains obscured because the farmlands compared in those studies could
78 vary in climatic and edaphic factors, obscuring potential relationship between cropping
79 system management and community processes of anti-nematode microbes. Moreover, because
80 incidence of cyst and root-knot nematodes generally varies at small spatial scales [22], there
81 can be spatial heterogeneity in abundance and community compositions of anti-nematode
82 bacteria and fungi within a farmland. Thus, sStudies focusing on fine-scale assembly of anti-
83 nematode microbes are are requiredawaited for developing agroecosystem management
84 protocols for controlling phytopathogenic nematodes.
85 We herein conducted By an Illumina sequencing analysis of bacteria and fungi in a
86 soybean (Glycine max) field, we and then examined how root and rhizosphere microbiome
87 structures varied among host plant individuals that differed in damage by root-knot nematodes
88 (Meloidogyne sp.). Based on the data of microbiomes at a small spatial scale, we statistically
89 explored microbial species/taxa that occurred preferentially in the roots or rhizosphere soil of
90 nematode-infected soybean individuals. We further investigated the structure of networks
91 depicting co-abundance patterns of microbial species/taxa within the soybean field, thereby
92 examining whether multiple anti-nematode bacteria and fungi form consortia (assemblages)
93 on/around the plant individuals infected by root-knot nematodes. Overall, this studyOur
94 results suggests that various taxonomic groups of anti-nematode bacteria and fungi are present
95 within indigenous microbiomes. Our resultsThis study also suggests that microbiome
96 assembly at fine spatial scales is a key to manage populations and communities of such
97 functional microbes.

99 2. Methods
100 2.1. Sampling
101 Fieldwork was conducted at the soybean field on the Hokubu Campus of Kyoto University,
102 Japan (35.033 ºN, 135.784 ºE). In the field, the soybean strain “Sachiyutaka” was sown at 15
103 cm intervals in two lines (electric supplementary material, figure S1) on July 4, 2016 [basal
104 fertilizer, N:P2O5:K2O = 3:10:10 g/m2]. In the lines, 69 and 62 individuals (“set 1” and “set
105 2”, respectively), respectively, were sampled every other positions (i.e., 30 cm intervals)
106 (Figfigure. 1) on October 7, 2016. The sampled soybean individuals were classified into three
107 categories: normal individuals with green leaves (“green”), individuals with yellow leaves
108 (“yellow”), and those with no leaves (“no leaf”) (Fig.figure 1A-Ca-c). Among them, “green” Formatted: Font: Italic
109 individuals exhibited normal growth, while “no leaf” individuals were heavily infected by
110 root-knot nematodes: “yellow” individuals showed intermediate characters. In total, 97
111 “green”, 19 “yellow”, and 15 “no leaf” individuals were sampled (Fig.figure 1D1d). Formatted: Font: Italic
112 For each individual, two segments of 5-cm terminal roots and rhizosphere soil were
113 collected from ca. 10-cm below the soil surface. The root and soil samples were transferred
114 into a cool box in the field and then stored at -80ºC until DNA extraction in the laboratory.
115 The whole above-ground bodies bodies of the individuals were placed in drying ovens at 80
116 ºC for 72 hours to measure dry mass. The dry mass data indicated that “green”, “yellow”, and
117 “no leaf” soybean individuals significantly differed in their biomass (Fig.figure 1C1c). Formatted: Font: Italic
118
119 2.2. DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing
120 The root segments of each individual were transferred to a 15 mL tube and washed in 70%
121 ethanol by vortexing for 10 s. The samples were then transferred to a new 15 mL tube and
122 then washed again in 70% ethanol by sonication (42 Hz) for 5 min. After an additional
123 sonication wash in a new tube, one of the two root segments were dried and placed in a 1.2
124 mL tube for each soybean individual. DNA extraction was then performed with a
125 cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method [23] after pulverizing the roots with 4 mm
5
126 zirconium balls at 25 Hz for 3 min using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen).
127 For DNA extraction from the rhizosphere soil, the ISOIL for Beads Beating kit (Nippon
128 Gene) was used as instructed by the manufacturer. For each sample, 0.5 g of soil was placed
129 into a 2 mL microtubes of the ISOIL kit. To increase the yield of DNA, 10 mg of skim milk
130 powder (Wako, 198-10605) was added to each sample [24].
131 For each of the root and soil samples, the 16S rRNA V4 region of the prokaryotes and the
132 internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of fungi were amplified. The PCR of the 16S
133 rRNA region was performed with the forward primer 515f [25] fused with 3–6-mer Ns for
134 improved Illumina sequencing quality [26] and the forward Illumina sequencing primer (5’-
135 TCG TCG GCA GCG TCA GAT GTG TAT AAG AGA CAG- [3–6-mer Ns] – [515f] -3’) and
136 the reverse primer 806rB [27] fused with 3–6-mer Ns and the reverse sequencing primer (5’-
137 GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG AGA TGT GTA TAA GAG ACA G [3–6-mer Ns] - [806rB] -3’)
138 (0.2 <U+F06D>M each). To prevent the amplification of mitochondrial and chloroplast 16S rRNA
139 sequences, specific peptide nucleic acids [(mPNA and pPNA; Lundberg, Yourstone [26]]
140 Lundberg, Yourstone [26]) (0.25 <U+F06D>M each) were added to the reaction mix of KOD FX Neo
141 (Toyobo). The temperature profile of the PCR was 94 ºC for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at
142 98 ºC for 10 s, 78 ºC for 10 s, 50 ºC for 30 s, 68 ºC for 50 s, and a final extension at 68 ºC for
143 5 min. To prevent generation of chimeric sequences, the ramp rate through the thermal cycles
144 was set to 1 ºC/sec [28]. Illumina sequencing adaptors were then added to respective samples
145 in the supplemental PCR using the forward fusion primers consisting of the P5 Illumina
146 adaptor, 8-mer indexes for sample identification [29] and a partial sequence of the sequencing
147 primer (5’- AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GAG ATC TAC AC - [8-mer index] - TCG TCG
148 GCA GCG TC -3’) and the reverse fusion primers consisting of the P7 adaptor, 8-mer
149 indexes, and a partial sequence of the sequencing primer (5’- CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC
150 ATA CGA GAT - [8-mer index] - GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG -3’). KOD FX Neo was used
151 with a temperature profile of 94 ºC for 2 min, followed by 8 cycles at 98 ºC for 10 s, 55 ºC for
152 30 s, 68 ºC for 50 s (ramp rate = 1 ºC/s), and a final extension at 68 ºC for 5 min. The PCR
153 amplicons of the 131 soybean individuals were then pooled after a purification/equalization
154 process with the AMPureXP Kit (Beckman Coulter). Primer dimers, which were shorter than
6
155 200 bp, were removed from the pooled library by supplemental purification with AMpureXP:
156 the ratio of AMPureXP reagent to the pooled library was set to 0.6 (v/v) in this process.
157 The PCR of fungal ITS1 region was performed with the forward primer ITS1F_KYO1
158 [30] fused with 3–6-mer Ns for improved Illumina sequencing quality [26] and the forward
159 Illumina sequencing primer (5’- TCG TCG GCA GCG TCA GAT GTG TAT AAG AGA
160 CAG- [3–6-mer Ns] – [ITS1F_KYO1] -3’) and the reverse primer ITS2_KYO2 [30] fused
161 with 3–6-mer Ns and the reverse sequencing primer (5’- GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG AGA
162 TGT GTA TAA GAG ACA G [3–6-mer Ns] - [ITS2_KYO2] -3’). The buffer and polymerase
163 system of KOD FX Neo was used with a temperature profile of 94 ºC for 2 min, followed by
164 35 cycles at 98 ºC for 10 s, 50 ºC for 30 s, 68 ºC for 50 s, and a final extension at 68 ºC for 5
165 min. Illumina sequencing adaptors and 8-mer index sequences were then added in the second
166 PCR as described above. The amplicons were purified and pooled as described above.
167 The sequencing libraries of the prokaryote 16S and fungal ITS regions were processed in
168 an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (run center: KYOTO-HE; 15% PhiX spike-in). Because the
169 quality of forward sequences is generally higher than that of reverse sequences in Illumina
170 sequencing, we optimized the MiSeq run setting in order to use only forward sequences.
171 Specifically, the run length was set 271 forward (R1) and 31 reverse (R4) cycles in order to
172 enhance forward sequencing data: the reverse sequences were used only for discriminating
173 between 16S and ITS1 sequences based on the sequences of primer positions.
174
175 2.3. Bioinformatics
176 The raw sequencing data were converted into FASTQ files using the program bcl2fastq 1.8.4
177 distributed by Illumina. The output FASTQ files were demultiplexed with the program
178 Claident v0.2.2017.05.22 [31, 32], by which sequencing reads whose 8-mer index positions
179 included nucleotides with low (< 30) quality scores were removed. The sequencing data were
180 deposited to DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (DRA006845). Only forward sequences were
181 used in the following analyses after removing low-quality 3’-ends using Claident. Noisy reads
182 [31] were subsequently discarded and then denoised dataset consisting of 2,041,573 16S and
7
183 1,325,199 ITS1 reads were obtained.
184 For each dataset of 16S and ITS1 regions, filtered reads were clustered with a cut-off
185 sequencing similarity of 97% using the program VSEARCH [33] as implemented in Claident.
186 The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) representing less than 10 sequencing reads were
187 subsequently discarded. The molecular identification of the remaining OTUs was performed
188 based on the combination of the query-centric auto-k-nearest neighbor (QCauto) method [32]
189 and the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm [34] as implemented in Claident. Note that
190 taxonomic identification results based on the combination of the QCauto search and the LCA
191 taxonomic assignment are comparable to, or sometimes more accurate than, those with the
192 alternative approaches [32, 35, 36]. In total, 5,351 prokatyote (bacterial or archaeal) OTUs
193 and 1,039 fungal OTUs were obtained for the 16S and ITS1 regions, respectively (electric
194 supplementary material, data S1). The UNIX codes used in the above bioinformatic pipeline
195 are available as electric supplementary material, data S2.
196 For each combination of target region (16S or ITS1) and sample type (root or soil), we
197 obtained a sample <U+F0B4> OTU matrix, in which a cell entry depicted the number of sequencing
198 reads of an OTU in a sample (electric supplementary material, data S3). The cell entries
199 whose read counts represented less than 0.1% of the total read count of each sample were
200 removed to minimize effects of PCR/sequencing errors [37]. The filtered matrix was then
201 rarefied to 1,000 reads per sample using the “rrarefy” function of the vegan 2.4-1 package
202 [38] of R 3.4.3 [39]. Samples with less than 1,000 reads were discarded in this process: the
203 numbers of samples in the rarefied sample <U+F0B4> OTU matrices were 119, 128, 117, and 128 for
204 root prokaryote, root fungal, soil prokaryote, and soil fungal matrices, respectively (electric
205 supplementary material, data S4).
206
207 2.4. Prokaryote and fungal community structure
208 Relationship between the number of sequencing reads and that of detected OTUs was
209 examined for each dataset (root prokaryote, root fungal, soil prokaryote, or soil fungal
210 dataset) with the “rarecurve” function of the R vegan package. Likewise, relationship between
8
211 the number of samples and that of OTUs was examined with the vegan “specaccum” function.
212 For each dataset, difference in OTU compositions among “green”, “yellow”, and “no leaf”
213 soybean individuals was examined by the permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA;
214 Anderson [40]) with the vegan “adonis” function (10,000 permutations). To control effects of
215 sampling positions (lines) on the community structure, the information of sampling sets (set 1
216 or set 2) was included as an explanatory variable in the PERMANOVA. The variation in OTU
217 compositions was visualized with nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the
218 vegan “metaMDS” function. To examine potential relationship between root/soil microbial
219 community structure and plant biomass, an additional PERMANOVA was performed for each
220 dataset. The information of sampling sets was included in the models. To explore signs of
221 spatial autocorrelation in the community data, a Mantel’s correlogram analysis was performed
222 with the vegan “mantel.correlog” function. The “Bray-Curtis” metric of <U+F062>-diversity was used
223 in the PERMANOVA, NMDS, and Mantel’s correlogram analyses.
224
225 2.5. Screening of host-state-specific OTUs
226 To explore prokaryote/fungal OTUs that preferentially occurred on/around “green”, “yellow”,
227 or “no leaf” soybean individuals, a randomization test was performed by shuffling the plant
228 state labels in each of the root prokaryote, root fungal, soil prokaryote, and soil fungal data
229 matrices (100,000 permutations). We then evaluated preference of a prokaryote/fungal OTU
230 (i) for a plant state (j) (“green”, “yellow”, or “no leaf”) as follows:
231 Preference (i, j) = [Nobserved (i, j) – Mean (Nranodomized (i, j))] / SD (Nranodomized (i, j)),
232 where Nobserved (i, j) denoted the mean number of the sequencing reads of OTU i among state j
233 soybean samples in the original data, and the Mean (Nranodomized (i, j)) and SD (Nranodomized (i, j))
234 were the mean and standard deviation of the number of sequencing reads for the focal OTU–
235 plant state combination across randomized matrices. Regarding this standardized preference
236 index, values larger than three generally represent strong preferences (false discovery rate
237 (FDR) < 0.05; see results of a previous study [35]): hence, we listed OTUs whose preference
238 values exceeded three.
9
239
240 2.6. Microbe–microbe networks
241 To examine how prokaryote and fungal OTUs co-occurred in root or soil samples, a co-
242 abundance network analysis was performed based on the sparse inverse covariance estimation
243 for ecological association inference (Spiec-Easi) method [41]. In each of the root and soil
244 sample analyses, the input data matrix was prepared by merging the sample <U+F0B4> OTU matrices
245 of prokaryotes and fungi. As inferences of co-abundance patterns were unavailable for rare
246 OTUs, only the OTUs detected from 30 or more samples were retained in the input matrices.
247 For each of the root and soil data matrices, a co-abundance analysis was performed with the
248 “spiec.easi” function of the R “SpiecEasi” package [41]. The networks depicting the co-
249 abundance patterns were drawn using the R “igraph” package [42].
250
251 3. Results
252 3.1. Prokaryotes and fungal community structure
253 On average, 107.9 (SD = 18.0), 25.4 (SD = 8.9), 172.5 (SD = 17.3), and 78.3 (SD = 10.5)
254 OTUs per sample were observed, respectively, from the root prokaryote, root fungal, soil
255 prokaryote, and soil fungal dataset after filtering and rarefaction steps (electric supplementary
256 material, figure S2). The total number of OTUs observed was 1387, 346, 1191, and 769 for
257 the root prokaryote, root fungal, soil prokaryote, and soil fungal datasets, respectively
258 (electric supplementary material, figure S3).
259 In the soybean field, the prokaryote community on roots was dominated by the bacterial
260 classes Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes, while that of
261 rhizosphere soil consisted mainly of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria, and
262 the archaeal lineage Thaumarchaeota (Fig.figure 2A2a). The fungal community of roots was Formatted: Font: Italic
263 dominated by the fungal orders Hypocreales, Sordariales, Plesporales, while that of soil
264 consisted mainly of Hypocreales, Agaricales, Eurotiales, Mortierellales, and Filobasidiales
265 (Fig.figure 2B2b). Regarding the order level compositions of fungi in the rhizosphere soil, the Formatted: Font: Italic
10
266 proportion of Orbiliales reads was much higher in “yellow” (3.62 %) and “no leaf” (4.82 %)
267 soybean individuals than in “green” ones (0.89 %) (Fig.figure 2). The genus level
268 compositions of the samples are shown in electric supplementary material, figure S4.
269 In each dataset (i.e., root prokaryote, root fungal, soil prokaryote, or soil fungal data),
270 microbial community structure varied among “green”, “yellow”, or “no leaf” soybean
271 individuals, although the effects of sampling sets on the community structure were much
272 stronger (Fig.figure 3). Even within each sampling set, spatial autocorrelations of
273 bacterial/fungal community structure were observed (electric supplementary material, figure
274 S4figure S5). Significant relationships between microbial community structure and soybean
275 biomass were observed in the soil prokaryote and soil fungal datasets but not in the root
276 prokaryote and root fungal datasets (Table table 1).
277
278 3.2. Screening of host-state-specific OTUs
279 In the root microbiome, only an unidentified fungal OTU showed a strong preference for
280 “green” soybean individuals, while 18 bacterial and 4 fungal OTUs occurred preferentially on
281 “no leaf” host individuals (Table table 2; electric supplementary material, figure S5figure S6).
282 The list of the bacteria showing preferences for “no leaf” soybean individuals included OTUs
283 whose 16S rRNA sequences were allied to those of Dyella, Herbaspirillum, Labrys,
284 Phenylobacterium, Gemmata, Chitinophaga, Pedobacter, Niastella, and Streptomyces (Table
285 table 2). The four fungal OTUs showing preferences for “no leaf” hosts were unidentified
286 basidiomycetes (Table table 2).
287 In the rhizosphere soil microbiome, seven prokaryote OTUs, including those belonging to
288 Chloroflexi (e.g., Sphaerobacteraceae sp.) and Proteobacteria (Kofleriaceae sp.), occurred
289 preferentially on “green” host individuals (Table table 3). Likewise, five fungal OTUs,
290 including those allied to basidiomycete yeasts in the genera Solicoccozyma and Saitozyma,
291 showed preferences for “green” soybean individuals (Table table 3). Results also revealed that
292 26 bacterial and 11 fungal OTUs had biased distributions in the rhizosphere of “no leaf”
293 soybean individuals (Table table 3). The list of microbes showing preferences for “no leaf”
11
294 hosts included OTUs allied to bacteria in the genera Pesudomonas, Nevskia, Cellvibrio,
295 Massilia, Duganella, Novosphingobium, Mucilaginibacter, and Flavobacterium and OTUs
296 allied to fungi in the genera Burgoa, Clonostachys, Plectosphaerella, Xylaria, Dactylellina,
297 Talaromyces, Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Peniophora (Table table 3). The list of microbes
298 that preferentially occurred on “no leaf” hosts involved OTUs with high sequence similarity
299 to the nematophagous fungi, Clonostachys rosea (Hypocreales) and Dactylellina sp.
300 (Orbiliales) (Table table 3). The reads of the Clonostachys (F_0257) and Dactylellina
301 (F_0163) OTUs, respectively, represented 9.5% and 3.5% of the sequencing reads of “no
302 leaf” samples (electric supplementary material, data S5). The indices of preferences for
303 “yellow” soybean individuals are shown in electric supplementary material, data S5.
304
305 3.3. Microbe–microbe networks
306 The structure of microbe–microbe networks (Fig.figure 4) were more complicated in the soil
307 microbiome data (Fig.figure 4C-Dc-d) than in the root microbiome data (Fig.figure 4A-Ba-b). Formatted: Font: Italic
Formatted: Font: Italic
308 Within the network representing co-abundance of microbes across root samples, the
309 Clonostachys OTU (F_0257) had a significant link with a Streptomyces OTU, while
310 Dactylellina was absent from the root microbiome network data (Fig.figure 4A4a). Within the Formatted: Font: Italic
311 positive co-abundance network of the rhizosphere soil microbiome (Fig.figure 4C4c), the Formatted: Font: Italic
312 Clonostachys (F_0257) and Dactylellina (F_0163) nematophagous fungal OTUs were
313 connected with each other (Table table 4). In addition, the Clonostachys OTU was linked with
314 two bacterial OTUs (Ralstonia and Rhizobiales) and fungal OTUs in the genera Calonectria
315 and Purpureocillium (Table table 4). Likewise, the Dactylellina OTU was connected also with
316 two Alphaproteobacterial OTUs and a bacterial OTU allied to Nitrospira japonica as well as
317 fungal OTUs in the genera Rhizophydium, Pochonia, Purpureocillium (Table table 4).
318
319 4. Discussion
320 Based on Illumina sequencing, we herein compared root-associated/rhizosphere microbial
12
321 communities between soybean individuals infected by root-knot nematodes and those
322 showing no symptoms. The results indicated that, in both soybean roots and rhizosphere soil,
323 prokaryote and fungal community structures significantly varied depending on host plant
324 states (Figs.figures 2 and 3). We further performed statistical analyses for screening
325 prokaryote and fungal OTUs preferentially associated with infected and benign soybean host
326 individuals (Tables tables 2-3; Fig.figure 4). The results are based on purely descriptive data
327 and hence they, in principle, are not direct evidences of interactions among plants, nematodes,
328 and microbiomes. : i.e., causal relationship among those agents remains unknown.
329 MoreoverA, as this study provided only “snap-shot” information of microbiome structure at
330 the end of a growing season, we need to conduct further studies uncovering temporal
331 microbiome dynamics throughout the growing season of soybeans are awaited. Nonetheless,
332 as detailed below, the statistical analyses suggest assembly of diverse anti-nematode bacteria
333 and fungi from indigenous microbial communities in the soybean field, providing a basis for
334 exploring ways to reduce damage by root-knot nematodes with those indigenous functional
335 microbes.
336 Within the root microbiome analyzed, various taxonomic groups of bacteria preferentially
337 occurred on “no leaf” soybean samples (Table table 2). Among them, the genus Streptomyces
338 is known to involve some species that suppress nematode populations, potentially used as
339 biological control agents for root-knot nematodes [43-46]. In contrast, Herbaspirillum,
340 Rickettsia, Chitinophaga, and Pedobacter have been reported as symbionts of nematodes,
341 potentially playing beneficial roles for host nematodes [47-49]. Thus, rResults of these
342 statistical analyses should be interpreted with caution, as they are likely to highlight not only
343 prospective microbes potentially parasitizing on pests/pathongens but also microbes that can
344 form mutualistic interactions with disease agents.
345 Within the soybean rhizosphere soil microbiome, diverse taxonomic groups of not only
346 bacteria but also fungi preferentially occurred around “no leaf” soybean individuals (Table
347 table 3). Among them, Pseudomonas has been known to suppress root-knot nematode
348 populations [50, 51] potentially by producing hydrogen cyanide [52] or extracellular protease
349 [53], but interactions with root-knot nematodes have not yet been examined for other bacteria
13
350 preferentially found in the rhizosphere of “no leaf” soybean individuals. Meanwhile, the list
351 of the fungal OTUs frequently observed in the rhizosphere of “no leaf” soybeans included
352 some fungi whose ability to suppressing suppress nematode populations had been well
353 documented (Ttable 3). Clonostachys rosea, for example, has been known as a prospective
354 biological control agent of plant- and animal-pathogenic nematodes [54, 55]. An
355 observational study based on green fluorescent protein imaging has indicated that the conidia
356 of the fungus adhere to nematode cuticle and their germ tubes penetrate nematode bodies,
357 eventually killing the invertebrate hosts [56]. The fungus is also known to produce a
358 subtilisin-like extracellular protease, which plays an important role during the penetration of
359 nematode cuticles [57]. In addition to Clonostachys, oOur analysis also highlighted a another
360 nematophagous fungus in the genus Dactylellina (teleomorph = Orbilia). Species in the genus
361 and many other fungi in the order Orbiliales produce characteristic trap structures with their
362 hyphae to prey on nematodes [58-60], often nominated as prospective biological control
363 agents [61-63].
364 An additional analysis focusing on Clonostachys and Dactylellina highlighted bacteria
365 and fungi that frequently co-occurred with the nematophagous fungi (Fig.figure 4). In the root
366 microbiome, Clonostachys and a Streptomyces OTU showed positively correlated
367 distributions across soybean samples (Table table 4). In the rhizosphere microbiome,
368 Clonostachys and Dactylellina showed significant co-abundance patterns (Table table 4).
369 Moreover, in the soil, the two nematophagous fungi co-occurred frequently with other
370 taxonomic groups of nematophagous fungi such as Purpureocillium, Pochonia, and
371 Rhizophydium (Table table 4; Fig.figure 5). Among them, fungi in the genus Purpureocillium
372 (Hypocreales: Ophiocordycipitaceae) have been known to suppress plant parasitic nematodes,
373 insect pests, and oomycete phytopathogens [64-67] and their genome sequences have been
374 analyzed for understanding the physiological mechanisms of the pest/pathogen suppression
375 [64, 68, 69]. As one of Purpureocillium species (P. liacinum) can form symbiotic interactions
376 with plants as endophytes [67, 70], it has been recognized as promising biological control
377 agents for commercial use [64].. Another Hypocreales genus, Pochonia (previously placed in
378 the genus Verticillium; teleomorph = Metacordyceps; Clavicipitaceae) has been known as
14
379 nematophagous as well and they can kill eggs and females of root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.)
380 and cyst (Globodera spp.) nematodes [68-71]. Pochonia fungi, especially P. chlamydosporia,
381 are also endophytic and hence they have been used in agriculture [75-78]. Species in the
382 chytrid genus Rhizophydium involve species that utilize nematodes as parasites or saprophytes
383 [72, 73]. They are known to explore host nematodes in the form of zoospores [72]. Overall,
384 ourAll these results suggest that indigenous anti-nematode or nematophagous microbes can
385 form consortia in soil ecosystems of soybean fields. It is important to note that the members
386 of the consortia do not necessarily interact with each other directly: i.e., they may merely
387 share habitat preferences [36, 37, 74]. However, the inferred structure of microbe–microbe
388 networks helps us understand overall consequences of ecological processes in microbiomes
389 [15].
390 Along with the consortia of anti-nematode microbes, an OTU in the genus Calonectria,
391 which causes leaf blight, wilt, and root rot of various plant species [75, 76], was frequently
392 observed (Table table 4). The phytopathogenic fungus might have attacked soybean
393 individuals weakened by root-knot nematodes. Alternatively, Calonectria may have infected
394 host soybeans earlier than root-knot nematodes, followed by the emergence of nematodes and
395 their exploiters (i.e., anti-nematode microbes). Given that fungi can interact with each other
396 both antagonistically and mutualistically in the soil [77, 78], direct interactions between
397 Calonectria and nematophagous fungi in the genera Clonostachys, Dactylellina,
398 Purpureocillium, Pochonia, and Rhizophydium are of particular interest. Studies examining
399 potential interactions involving soybeans, root-knot nematodes, anti-nematode bacteria/fungi,
400 and Calonectria will help us understand ecological processes that structure consortia of
401 nematophagous fungi.
402 Although this study did not evaluate potential effects of background environmental
403 conditions (e.g., soil pH and inorganic nitrogen concentration) on microbiome structure,
404 management of edaphic conditions are expected to have great impacts on dynamics of anti-
405 nematode microbiomes. A number of studies have explored ways to suppress nematode
406 populations by optimizing cropping systems [1]. Crop rotation, in which planting of a crop
407 variety and that of nematode-resistant varieties/species are rotated, has been recognized as an
15
408 effective technique for regulating root-knot and cyst nematode populations [8, 79, 80]. In
409 contrast, long-term continual cropping in soybean monoculture fields can increase anti-
410 nematode bacteria and fungi (e.g., Pseudomonas, Purpureocillium, and Pochonia), potentially
411 resulting in lowered densities of cyst nematodes [12]. Tillage regimes [9-11] and introduction
412 of organic matter (e.g., alfalfa leaves or crop residue) [81-83] have great impacts on nematode
413 densities in farmlands, but their effects vary considerably among studies [1]. In addition,
414 because nematode-infected plant individuals infected by nematodes can show highly
415 aggregated distributions at a small spatial scale within a farmland (Fig.figure 1D1d), tillage Formatted: Font: Italic
416 can promote the spread of plant damaging nematodes [22]. Frequent tillage may have
417 negative impacts on populations of nematophagous fungi as a consequence of hyphal
418 fragmentation (cf. [84]), but such destructive effects on fungal communities have not yet been
419 tested intensively. Given that microbiome structures were not taken into account in most
420 previous studies evaluating effects of cropping systems on nematode suppression (but see
421 [12, 21]), more insights into relationship between agroecosystem management and indigenous
422 (native) microbiome dynamics are required for building reproducible ways for developingto
423 develop disease-suppressive soil.
424 We herein found that consortia of anti-nematode bacteria and fungi could develop at a
425 small spatial scale within a field of soybeans infected by root-knot nematodes. Taking into
426 accountGiven the diversity of those anti-nematode microbes observed in this study, multiple
427 biological control agents are potentially available in situ without introducing exogenous ones
428 depending on base compositions and conditions of indigenous microbiomes within and
429 around a focal farmland. In this respect, design of cropping systems (e.g., crop rotations,
430 tillage frequencies, and inputs of fertilizer or organic matter) is of particular importance in
431 activating and maximizing ecosystem functions that stem from resident microbial diversity
432 [15]. Because those indigenous microbes, in general, have adapted to local biotic and abiotic
433 environments, their populations are expected to persist more stably than exogenous microbes
434 artificially introduced to a target agroecosystem (see [19] for reviews of the success/failure of
435 microbial introduction). Elucidating relationship between cropping systems and microbiome
436 processes is the key to design disease-suppressive agroecosystems.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript is acceptable except a minor comment. Actually Dactylellina is trapping fungus and
can capture secondary-stage juveniles and Clonostachys, Pochonia and Purpureocillium can parasitize
on nematode eggs. Those fungi associated with no-leaf individuals of soybean, that means high
nematode densities in no-leaf individuals can stimulate the multiply of those fungi. Authors may
discuss this point a little bit.
Response:
The suggested information of Dactylellina and other anti-nematode fungi has been
included in the revised manuscript (l.353-355, 359-378).
