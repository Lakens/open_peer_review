Achache et al took a replica of an Anna's Hummingbird's wing, simulated molt in which various
combinations of feathers were removed, and then measured the estimated flow-field around the
wing as a function of these treatments. Parts of the paper were rather unclear, especially the
methods which are not presented here, and are not already in a published paper. I found parts of
the results and discussion to be hard to evaluate in the absence of methods.
Overall, this is a confirmatory study, I didn't really learn anything fundamentally new about
hummingbirds from this paper. Much of the intro and discussion talks about topics tangential to
what their data actually support. Data from live birds would have greatly improved the quality
of the discussion or ideas presented.
Major suggestions:
(1) Methods are lacking. How many wings were used? Was more than one wing was used to
build the model...? It seems it might have been from a single wing that was slightly underspread
(see below), and this sample size has generated some problems (see 3, below). What was the age
and sex of the birds from whom the wings were obtained? Anna's hummingbirds are sexually
3
dimorphic in mass and wing morphology, and this varies with age as well. Surprisingly, the very
most relevant study to the present one, Kruyt et al 2014, is not cited!
(2) Cut the "Scenario 1" from the discussion, it is not realistic nor based on any sort of actual data.
No study has found that body mass remains constant during the annual molt, and I seriously
doubt that mass remains the same. All birds lose condition when molting- - this is also
anecdotally known in hummingbird husbandry. In fact, the authors are ignoring a bigger issue--
hummingbirds vary their body mass by 25% (Calder et al., 1990; Hou et al., 2015), every single
day, since they eat a whole bunch of food right before beadtime. Thus the varying scenarios that
the authors present are in fact faced by the same individual at different points in the day. Also a
related issue that has been studied quite a bit is mass gain during migration. Some species can
gain a gram or more of fat during migration.
(3) Cut the "P8 treatment" from the paper, it is clearly flawed. It is obvious that many of the
results of this treatment in particular are due to experimental artefacts. Specifically, the wing
used in this study was under-spread such that P8 overlapped with its neighboring feathers more
than it should have. Most studies of dried hummingbird wings wind up using wings that are
under-spread. The spread of this wing is pretty good overall, but it is p8 that in particular that is
problematic. The result that removing P8 barely impacted the wing's surface area is clearly an
artefact. A hummingbird's wing, when properly spread, does not have a concave perimeter in the
trailing edge--- google images of hummingbirds in flight. In fact, google image search of "Steve
Zamek Anna's hummingbird", the first image clearly shows an Anna's Hummingbird in flight, in
which P8 has mostly regrown (note the base is clearly in sheathe), and you can see that the
missing P8 clearly influences the back edge of the wing. A slightly underspread wing won't affect
some types of aerodynamic measurements all that much, but when the authors want to zoom in
and focus on a subtle issue such as the contribution to the wing's surface area of a single feather,
as the present authors have done, then they need to work with material suitable for the focus of
their study.
Kruyt et al 2014 provides a figure 2 of a bunch of spread hummingbird wings as an example,
some of these wings are quite good and the rest are slightly under-spread, just like the present
author's wing. Notice how the very best wings have a straight trailing edge, not a concave one.
There should have been a substantial gap in the wing in the P8 removal treatment. The fact that
there isn't a gap in the present authors' data indicates that all of their data for this experimental
treatment is an experimental artifact. I think the best solution to this problem is to drop this
entire treatment from the analyses, since I didn't find myself believing any of the author's
assertions about the P8 treatment, anywhere in the paper.
Notes as I read the paper:
Lines 25-28 this is a bit of an oversimplification, I would not expect molt to always cost this much
extra metabolic cost
Line 29: not necessarily—it depends on which definition of “energy for flight” the authors mean.
Chai et al showed that molting hummingbirds decrease mass, apparently in order to reduce flight
costs. Might delete this statement, since energy for flight does not play a role in the author's later
arguments
Figure 1: Strange to call the secondaries the “root”—they are a part of the wing, the same as the
primaries. They are the arm wing rather than the hand wing.
page 4 line 33-- "elevated metabolism" here and above-- this is tricky and large parts of the
literature are sloppy about this. Is it really elevated? Chai 1997 measured *mass specific*
4
metabolism, and then found that as the birds decrease in mass, their mass specific metabolism
increased. But look at the numbers in Chai's table 1. Multiply body mass by mass-specific
metabolic rate, and all three experimental treatments have essentially the same metabolic rate, if
anything metabolism declined in the "moulting, intermediate wing area loss" treatment. Which
value matters to the bird? I submit it's more likely whole bird metabolism, rather than mass
specific metabolism. Getting skinny reduces metabolic rate, not increases it.
Line 43: reference 27 is unpublished, making it hard for me to evaluate these methods
Line 48: Male, or female? Adult, or hatch-year? They are sexually dimorphic, and morphology
varies with age
line 56--these are strange references for this assertion. There are studies on air transmissivity of
bird wing feathers, cite those instead! Didn't David Lentink have a paper on hummingbird wing
air transmissivity? (or maybe that was just an idea for a project, I don't recall a specific citation to
suggest)
Figure 2: The wing is slightly under-spread. When fully spread, the trailing edge is essentially
straight, whereas here the trailing edge is concave at around the tip of p8, p7, and p6. Not
necessarily a fatal flaw here, but treatment D is biologically unrealistic.
Page 5 line 36 assertion that feathers in contact with air are prone to wear and damage is naive
and probably incorrect. At a minimum, back up this speculation with some references-- there is a
large ornithological literature on how feathers wear. I submit that most wear in outer wing
feathers comes from mechanical abrasion with substrates, except for that one white frigatebird
Jedd Burt had once -- (Schreiber, R. W., E. A. Schreiber, A. M. Peele*, and E. H. Burtt, Jr. 2006.
Pattern of damage to albino Great Frigatebird flight feathers supports hypothesis of abrasion by
airborne particles. Condor 108: 736-741). But that albino bird was the exception that proves the
rule
Page 7 lin15 "of the manufacturing process described earlier" the manufacturing process was not
described earlier-- another unpublished paper was cited
Page 7 line 17-- what previous study? This statement should be supported by a citation
also, delete the sentence "this aspect will be investigated in a future study", there is no point in
saying that here.
Page 8 "due to the increasing overlap..." this could be an artifact of an unrealistic wing
preparation, this needs to be acknowledged in the text
Page 8 lines 35-38-- cite one of the Tobalske studies showing that hummingbirds do have an
attached leading edge vortex, and modify this text accordingly
Page 8 line 48-- explain the meaning of coherence here in the context of vorticity, where it is
claimed that the vortices lose coherence-- spatial coherence? Temporal coherence? Coherence
with the wing, i.e. how it is attached with the wing? Coherence from one stroke to the next?
Figure 5: I am confused, why is there a large region of detached flow in Figure 5A? is this to
imply that the wing was highly inefficient at this orientation? Is this in any way representative of
a hummingbird in flight, or is this a complete experimental artifact? Why a regular wing should
have so much drag, whereas a wing missing P10 should have so little, strikes me as likely to be
inaccurate. Especially as birds missing wing feathers likely change their kinematics, and thus
5
comparing an intact wing to a wing missing feathers with the same kinematic conditions is not a
perfectly valid example.
Pg 13 Line 55 this is unclear to me-- are the authors really asserting that Sapir and Dudley found
no weight loss during molt? A word search on that paper for the word 'molt' returns no hits.
And why is no weight loss during molt a "likely scenario"? Given that ALL published studies on
molt in hummingbirds suggest that weight goes down while molting, I think the only likely
scenario is that anna's hummingbird weight goes down as well. Also the authors are making a
somewhat simplistic argument, to boot. It is well known that hummingbird body masses
fluctuate dramatically over the course of the day (Calder et al., 1990; Hou et al., 2015). It's quite a
bit more than 10% per the statement on the next page.
Figure 9: Panel D is inaccurate. A given Anna's hummingbird individual does not spend 6
months molting their wings. It's 2 months, 3 tops. You are mistakening a range derived from a
population (earliest individuals are molting in June, very late individuals are finishing molt in
December) for what an individual does. But just because there are individuals in the population
molting over a 6-month span does not mean that wing molt takes every individual 6 months!
That's like saying "there are women pregnant any given point in time, therefore all women are
pregnant all the time". Males are on breeding territories in November and most individuals are
full-feathered (including finishing body molt) by then. See also (Pyle, 1997).
Page 15, line 6-- something I'm not following here: what about increasing stroke amplitude? How
are kinematic changes factored into this analysis?
Page 15 line 24 "territorial clashes lessen until they cease altogether" -- this is incorrect. What you
mean to say is that the birds seem to reduce activity a bit and individuals that had been territorial
sometimes lose their territories to other birds. They most definitely continue competing for
resources during the non-breeding season. (Ortiz-Crespo, 1980; Yeaton and Laughrin, 1976)
line 53 "aggressive interactions are relatively rare during molt". I disagree-- when molting they
don't win as often , but aggressive interactions are still fairly frequent.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Dear Mr Achache,
Thank you for your submission to RSOS. Two reviewers have made significant criticisms of your
manuscript , in particular relating to your ecological interpretations of the biomechanical data.
On the other hand, they find the biomechanical results interesting in their own right. You might
consider merging the two manuscripts into one, as there are no particular page or word limits at
label_version_2
RSOS.
I should note that two different reviewers accepted review of this manuscript than the two
reviewers who saw your first manuscript, so they were justifiably confused about missing
7
methods. If you choose to resubmit, please ensure that you forward via the submission system or
to the editorial team a copy of the first part manuscript so that the reviewers of the second part
are able to read it. You might alternatively place the submitted version of part I on a preprint
server such as BioRrxiv http://biorxiv.org/ and supply the reviewers with its DOI.

The authors have adequately addressed my concerns addressed in my previous review. The
current version of the manuscript is nicely focused on the biomechanical results, and the removal
of the speculative natural history applications have eliminated the serious distractions found in
the earlier draft. Nice work!
The authors do need to give this version of the manuscript a good read as I encountered several
grammatical errors in various places that should be corrected.
The only point from my previous review that I will revisit is the idea that ground effects could be
an important strategy for mounting birds. The authors claim, in their response to my comment,
that hummingbirds rarely are stationary near the ground (or flat surface). This comment simply
shows that the authors really have not spent much time watching hummingbirds in the wild.
Hummingbirds forage frequently on low-lying herbaceous plants where ground effects could be
quite useful. I am not requesting that the authors alter any content based on this comment, but
perhaps it might be a good idea to spend some time getting to know these creatures if they plan
to continue using hummingbirds as a model for their work.

The authors have done a good job incorporating feedback from the review process. I have only
very minor comments:
pg 18, line 49: typos
Pg 28: Typo: distinguish, not distinct
also, avoid contractions there's -> there is; it's -> it is
Figure 2: add word "male" to description of wing. I think it is important to emphasize slightly
more that the analysis done here was for only one sex; sex differences were ignored. Although
sexual dimorphism of wing morphology (of this species) is slight enough that it matters little to
this study, there are a number of papers on hummingbird flight that use only males and imply
their results are general to all hummingbirds when they may not be.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have done a good job incorporating feedback from the review process. I have only
very minor comments:
pg 18, line 49: typos
Pg 28: Typo: distinguish, not distinct
also, avoid contractions there's -> there is; it's -> it is
Figure 2: add word "male" to description of wing. I think it is important to emphasize slightly
more that the analysis done here was for only one sex; sex differences were ignored. Although
sexual dimorphism of wing morphology (of this species) is slight enough that it matters little to
this study, there are a number of papers on hummingbird flight that use only males and imply
their results are general to all hummingbirds when they may not be.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have adequately addressed my concerns addressed in my previous review. The
current version of the manuscript is nicely focused on the biomechanical results, and the removal
of the speculative natural history applications have eliminated the serious distractions found in
the earlier draft. Nice work!
The authors do need to give this version of the manuscript a good read as I encountered several
grammatical errors in various places that should be corrected.
The only point from my previous review that I will revisit is the idea that ground effects could be
an important strategy for mounting birds. The authors claim, in their response to my comment,
that hummingbirds rarely are stationary near the ground (or flat surface). This comment simply
shows that the authors really have not spent much time watching hummingbirds in the wild.
Hummingbirds forage frequently on low-lying herbaceous plants where ground effects could be
quite useful. I am not requesting that the authors alter any content based on this comment, but
perhaps it might be a good idea to spend some time getting to know these creatures if they plan
to continue using hummingbirds as a model for their work.

neral Comments:
From a biomechanical perspective this study interesting because it offers the first
asurements of flow characteristics around hummingbird wings during hovering. This
wledge is an important contribution in that hummingbird hovering represents a unique
ction in vertebrate flight evolution (convergence with insects). There results offer good
lanation of observed hummingbird molt patterns, which in and of itself makes the study
rthwhile.
Even though the basic results of this study are interesting there are issues I believe need
e addressed. First and foremost this study relies heavily on the author’s unpublished and
eviewed companion paper describing flow characteristics of an complete wing. In my view
is poor practice, and makes this manuscript impossible to properly review since 1) the
panion manuscript was not made available to me, and 2) it has not been accepted for
lication. If this companion manuscript is not accepted for publication then this manuscript
l need a complete rewrite. I assume those reviewing this companion manuscript will be
luating the uniqueness of the author’s complete wing measurements relative to other studies
have made similar measurements on live birds.
I am also concerned that the authors have a poor understanding of their study species.
rything they know seems based on Williamson (1956), a study simply not intended for the
e of natural history extensions made by the authors in their conclusion. Below I will suggest
eral additional readings that will be helpful in expanding the author’s understanding of
na’s hummingbird annual cycles and current distribution. Frankly, the authors would be fine
making broad natural history extrapolations of their data and focusing solely on their
mechanical findings as these are the interesting results. It is possible that the author’s attempt
xtrapolate their data to free-living birds is an appeal to the broader audience of RSOS, but in
end I think it distracts from the key results.
cific Comments:
e 2, Line 15: Here you shift from impact of feather damage on lift production to factors that
pe molt patterns. Perhaps start a new paragraph?
e 3, Line 55: This is a key assumption for the author’s work so they might want to offer
er justification than these cited references. Reference #27 is listed as submitted so cannot be
luated and #30 deals with insect flight, which in some cases is kinematically similar, but not
ntical to hummingbirds. Reference #28 only suggests that hummingbird wings are “rigid”
tive to other birds.
e 4, Line 46: I am not clear on what is meant by “abruptly moulting.” Are the authors
rring to unnatural feather removal? Later the authors refer to this model as an “unnatural
ulting stage,” which also seems incorrect. The authors should reconsider there terminology
e.
e 8, Line 49: The interpretation of the influence of the secondary vortex is stated as a fact.
ndering if the wording should not be softened to suggest the impact of the secondary vortex?
e 9, Line 42: The authors should change terminology here. Since wing structure such as this
ht only occur due to accident, referring to it as a “moult stage” is not correct.
e 11, Line 54: During hovering meaningful lift is also produced during the upstroke (see
rence 38). How might this contribute to diminished wing performance during moult? Below
authors assume that upstroke accounts for a fixed 30% of lift production, yet I wonder if
uced ability to produce proper camber when the wing is inverted makes this assumption
stionable? It would seem difficult to address some of the author’s conclusions below without
ood understanding of molt impact on upstroke.
e 13, Line 33: This is a method and should be moved to the methods section.
e 14, Line 43: Hummingbirds easily change their body mass by 10% by simply feeding, so
rt-term fluctuations occur regularly throughout the day. What does this mean for a molting
mmingbird? How does this impact your various scenarios?
e 15, Line 26 (and several places below): I will say up front that I think the authors should
ain from making broad extrapolations of their data to free-living hummingbirds. They have
y evaluated flow for upstroke and should confine their analyses and conclusions to that.
ything else is really just speculation.
authors should use caution here when inferring cause to observations made by Williamson
56). Anna’s have an extended breeding season that for males can begin as early as November
continue into May (see Stiles 1973, Ewald & Carpenter 1978, Powers 1987, Eberhard &
ald 1994; also see the Anna’s hummingbird BNA account – Russell & Clark 2012). It could
argued that the reduction in agonistic behavior and territory size is as much a transition from
eding to feeding behavior as anything else. A more complete assessment of the Anna’s
ual cycle is warranted if the authors wish to suggest how their results translate to real birds.
o, the authors should look at Kim et al. (2014). This paper looks at how ground effects can
er hovering costs. This might be a relevant strategy during molt.
ally, the authors should consider how variable daily metabolic costs and food availability are
Anna’s. When Williamson (1956) was written, the species was largely confined to portions
California. Now, they range from SW United States all the way up into Canada (with sitings
ar north as Alaska). The point here is that if the molt cycle for birds in the NW is similar to
reported by Williamson, then their energetic costs are likely substantially higher, and food
uisition more difficult due to cooler temperatures and less food availability.
e 15, Line 43: Why is this a good assumption? Wing mass is unlikely to change beyond a
uction in feather number during molt, so this assumption over simplifies the connection
ween muscle mass and power production for hovering. I know Chai made the same
umption, but he was also careful to point out that the assumption might not be realistic.
e 16, Line 12: The data cited here are only for 2 species that were held in a captive
ironment. Thus, this statement is too strong since not evidence is presented that free-living
mmingbirds reduce their mass during molt. The authors might consider seeking input from
or more of the many hummingbird banders regarding weight changes in natural populations
ing molt. One good source might be the Hummingbird Monitoring Network which bands in
ny places where Anna’s occur.
e 16, Line 28: The authors have not provided convincing evidence for this conclusion. See
comments above.
e 16, Line 36: This is the author’s best conclusion based on their analysis of P89 removal.

r editors of the Royal Society Open Science journal,
ase find enclosed our revised manuscript entitled ”Hovering hummingbird wing aerodynamics dur-
the annual cycle: II. Implications of wing feather moult” (manuscript #RSOS-170184). We provide
ow a detailed point-by-point response to the comments of the reviewers and revised the manuscript

lication in Royal Society Open Science.

mment 1: From a biomechanical perspective this study interesting because it offers the first
asurements of flow characteristics around hummingbird wings during hovering. This knowledge is an
ortant contribution in that hummingbird hovering represents a unique direction in vertebrate flight
lution (convergence with insects). There results offer good explanation of observed hummingbird
ult patterns, which in and of itself makes the study worthwhile.
sponse: We thank the reviewer for his encouraging assessment.
mment 2: Even though the basic results of this study are interesting there are issues I believe
d to be addressed. First and foremost this study relies heavily on the author’s unpublished and
eviewed companion paper describing flow characteristics of a complete wing. In my view this is
r practice, and makes this manuscript impossible to properly review...
sponse: We apologise about this misunderstanding and for not providing the reviewers the
panion manuscript describing our measurements of a complete wing. We submitted the two
nuscripts together as two parts of the same study and apparently these two papers were unfortu-
ely reviewed as two separate contributions by two different sets of reviewers.
mment 3: I am also concerned that the authors have a poor understanding of their study species.
rything they know seems based on Williamson (1956), a study simply not intended for the type of
ural history extensions made by the authors in their conclusion. Below I will suggest several addi-
al readings that will be helpful in expanding the author’s understanding of Anna’s hummingbird
ual cycles and current distribution. Frankly, the authors would be fine not making broad natural
ory extrapolations of their data and focusing solely on their biomechanical findings as these are

ults.

sponse: We thank the reviewer for his constructive review that assisted us to improve our work.
owing this comment we substantially reduced the broader natural history inferences that were
de in the previous version of the manuscript.
mment 4: Page 2, Line 15: Here you shift from impact of feather damage on lift production to
ors that shape moult patterns. Perhaps start a new paragraph?
sponse: Done. Please see Page 2 Line 15 in the revised manuscript.
mment 5: Page 3, Line 55: This is a key assumption for the author’s work so they might want to
r better justification than these cited references. Reference #27 is listed as submitted so cannot
evaluated and #30 deals with insect flight, which in some cases is kinematically similar, but not
ntical to hummingbirds. Reference #28 only suggests that hummingbird wings are ”rigid” relative
ther birds.
sponse: Previous studies suggested that hummingbird wings are rigid throughout the downstroke
balske et al., 2007, M.Maeda et al., 2017, Tanaka et al., 2013). Moreover, it was demonstrated that
porosity of the wings has very little effect, if existing at all, on its performance (Kruyt et al., 2014,
melech and Ellington, 2013). The above justified the use of a rigid and non-porous 3D printed wing
del to analyse Anna’s hummingbird’s complete wing performance and aerodynamics. However, to
best of our knowledge, there is no published data regarding these properties (wing deformation and
transmissivity) for a hummingbird wing during active moult of its flight feathers. Therefore, the
g is assumed to be rigid and non-porous throughout the annual cycle for the purpose of presenting
rst attempt to understand the consequences of flight feather moult on the wing’s aerodynamic
formance. It is understood that the results presented herein might be an over estimation of the
g’s performance, which needs to be assessed by a designated research.
added the above explanation to the text (Page 4, Line 46).
mment 6: Page 4, Line 46: I am not clear on what is meant by ”abruptly moulting.” Are the
hors referring to unnatural feather removal? Later the authors refer to this model as an ”unnatural
ulting stage,” which also seems incorrect. The authors should reconsider there terminology here.
sponse: The text was revised accordingly and addresses the P89 wing as a wing configuration
oughout the manuscript.
mment 7: Page 8, Line 49: The interpretation of the influence of the secondary vortex is stated
a fact. Wondering if the wording should not be softened to suggest the impact of the secondary
tex?
sponse: The text was softened as suggested (”...might have been...”, Page 9, Line 55)
mment 8: Page 9, Line 42: The authors should change terminology here. Since wing structure
h as this might only occur due to accident, referring to it as a ”moult stage” is not correct.
sponse: Done. See our response to Comment #6.
mment 9: Page 11, Line 54: During hovering meaningful lift is also produced during the upstroke
reference 38). How might this contribute to diminished wing performance during moult? Below
authors assume that upstroke accounts for a fixed 30% of lift production, yet I wonder if reduced
ity to produce proper camber when the wing is inverted makes this assumption questionable? It
ld seem difficult to address some of the author’s conclusions below without a good understanding
moult impact on upstroke.
2
sponse: Following this comment, the entire section discussing wing performance during moult
revised and re-written. We now present an analysis that consists of three scenarios: 1. Where
re’s no body mass reduction during moult; 2. Where there’s 25% body mass reduction with fixed
scle mass; 3. Same body mass reduction as Scenario 2 for moult stages P1-4 and SP6 and 10%
y mass reduction at the P10 moult stage. Moreover, the impact of the upstroke contribution was
examined for a range of h values, accounting for the downstroke contribution to overall weight
port of the wingbeat (see Page 4 Line 10).
mment 10: Page 13, Line 33: This is a method and should be moved to the methods section.
sponse: Done. See Page 5 Line 40.
mment 11: Page 14, Line 43: Hummingbirds easily change their body mass by 10% by simply
ing, so short-term fluctuations occur regularly throughout the day. What does this mean for a
ulting hummingbird? How does this impact your various scenarios?
sponse: We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment. In the updated version of the
nuscript we discuss wing performance (Page 4 Line 10) and present the power requirements for
erent body masses under three different scenarios, two of which include a constant body mass and
% decrease in body mass. Therefore, the daily 10% variation in body mass is inclusive in the tested
ge. We additionally discuss body mass variation during the day in the updated manuscript and its
sible implications for flight biomechanics (Page 2 Line 50). Since data on hummingbird body mass
he wild is scarce, including during the feather moulting period, we limit our calculations to the
erent scenarios outlined above and we hope that future studies will be able to address this issue
re accurately following the collection of field data on hummingbird body mass variation during the
ulting period.
mment 12: Page 15, Line 26 (and several places below): I will say up front that I think the
hors should refrain from making broad extrapolations of their data to free-living hummingbirds.
y have only evaluated flow for upstroke and should confine their analyses and conclusions to that.

he authors should use caution here when inferring cause to observations made by Williamson
56). Anna’s have an extended breeding season that for males can begin as early as November and
tinue into May (see Stiles 1973, Ewald & Carpenter 1978, Powers 1987, Eberhard & Ewald 1994;
see the Anna’s hummingbird BNA account Russell & Clark 2012). It could be argued that the
uction in agonistic behavior and territory size is as much a transition from breeding to feeding
avior as anything else. A more complete assessment of the Anna’s annual cycle is warranted if the
hors wish to suggest how their results translate to real birds.
sponse: Following this and several additional comments regarding our inferences for hummingbird
ural history, we revised the text and substantially reduced our extensions regarding hummingbird
ural history.
mment 13: Also, the authors should look at Kim et al. (2014). This paper looks at how ground
cts can lower hovering costs. This might be a relevant strategy during moult.
sponse: Ground effects may indeed reduce hovering costs when flying close to the ground. Yet,
e hummingbirds hardly ever sustain their flight close to the ground and other flat surfaces, in
ctice such effects are rare and hence are likely not substantial in the birds’ energy budget.
mment 14: Finally, the authors should consider how variable daily metabolic costs and food
ilability are for Anna’s. When Williamson (1956) was written, the species was largely confined to
tions of California. Now, they range from SW United States all the way up into Canada (with
ngs as far north as Alaska). The point here is that if the moult cycle for birds in the NW is similar
hat reported by Williamson, then their energetic costs are likely substantially higher, and food
uisition more difficult due to cooler temperatures and less food availability.
3
sponse: Due to lack of empirical data regarding Anna’s hummingbird energy budget throughout
distribution range and due to our wish to minimise any natural history extensions, we decided not
nclude such considerations within the manuscript as they may substantially distract the reader
m the main points of this work. We do note that Anna’s hummingbird is a partial migrant, with
s inhabiting the northern part of the species’ range migrating to more hospitable areas during
ter. Consequently, making any assumptions regarding daily energy budget at different localities
xtremely difficult to assess without sound empirical data that, to the best of our knowledge, are
sently not reported in the scientific literature.
mment 15: Page 15, Line 43: Why is this a good assumption? Wing mass is unlikely to change
ond a reduction in feather number during moult, so this assumption over simplifies the connection
ween muscle mass and power production for hovering. I know Chai made the same assumption,
he was also careful to point out that the assumption might not be realistic.
sponse: Please see our response to comment 9. This scenario was accordingly changed so the
scle mass remained constant throughout moult (see Page 14, Line 10).
mment 16: Page 16, Line 12: The data cited here are only for 2 species that were held in a
tive environment. Thus, this statement is too strong since not evidence is presented that free-
ng hummingbirds reduce their mass during moult. The authors might consider seeking input from
or more of the many hummingbird banders regarding weight changes in natural populations during
ult. One good source might be the Hummingbird Monitoring Network which bands in many places
re Anna’s occur.
sponse: We believe that the updated discussion on wing performance during moult is detailed
ugh and presents several scenarios that likely represent hummingbird wing performance in the
d. Moreover, our results are compared to the few works which described hummingbird wing moult
body mass variation, all of which indeed examined captive hummingbirds. We did not consider
ublished data for our calculations since such data did not pass peer review and as such could be
sed by several reasons, such as methodological differences between different banders, specifically
h respect to registering moult data and wing surface area in the field. Future improvement of our
k is of course desired and we specifically propose to collect and publish field data that may refine
calculations in the future.
mment 17: Page 16, Line 28: The authors have not provided convincing evidence for this con-
ion. See my comments above.
sponse: Following this comment we deleted this text.

mment 18: Methods are lacking. How many wings were used? Was more than one wing was used
build the model...? It seems it might have been from a single wing that was slightly underspread
below), and this sample size has generated some problems (see 3, below). What was the age and
of the birds from whom the wings were obtained? Anna’s hummingbirds are sexually dimorphic
mass and wing morphology, and this varies with age as well. Surprisingly, the very most relevant
dy to the present one, Kruyt et al 2014, is not cited!
sponse: Please see our response to Comment #2 and the Methods section of the first manuscript
m this project Achache et al., 2017. We specifically note that the two contributions by Kruyt
al. (Kruyt et al., 2014, 2015) were cited multiple times in the first manuscript of this project.
apologise again for this misunderstanding and for not providing sufficient information about the
dy’s methodology. We hope that the detailed description of the methods in the paper that is
ady published is sufficient to address all the questions regarding our methodology.

mment 19: Cut the ”Scenario 1” from the discussion, it is not realistic nor based on any sort
ctual data. No study has found that body mass remains constant during the annual moult, and
riously doubt that mass remains the same. All birds lose condition when moulting- - this is
anecdotally known in hummingbird husbandry. In fact, the authors are ignoring a bigger issue–
mingbirds vary their body mass by 25% (Calder et al., 1990; Hou et al., 2015), every single day,
e they eat a whole bunch of food right before bedtime. Thus the varying scenarios that the authors
sent are in fact faced by the same individual at different points in the day. Also a related issue that
been studied quite a bit is mass gain during migration. Some species can gain a gram or more of
during migration.
sponse: Indeed, hummingbirds exhibit large variation in their body mass, both on a seasonal
is during the feather moult and migration periods and on a daily basis for example when feeding
nsively before nighttime. Yet, it is still unknown if during the moult process the decrease in
body mass occurs simultaneously with the reduction in the birds’ wing area and this possible
match may result in cases where wing area was reduced but bird body mass was not, justifying
exploration of Scenario 1. Intense feeding and hence weight gain during different parts of the
and specifically before nighttime during the moulting period may further justify exploring this
nario. We consequently add these explanations in the text and include in the revised manuscript
eral references that describe the large variation in the body mass of hummingbirds in different
ts of the day (Page 2 Line 50 and Page 14 Line 18). Although Anna’s hummingbird is a partial
rant, we decided not to explore body mass gains for migrating birds due to lack of empirical data
arding this phenomenon in this hummingbird species, and also because such exploration, although
resting, could distract the readers from the main focus of the manuscript that deals with wing
d and aerodynamics under several wing feather moult stages.
mment 20: Cut the ”P8 treatment” from the paper, it is clearly flawed. It is obvious that many
he results of this treatment in particular are due to experimental artefacts. Specifically, the wing
d in this study was under-spread such that P8 overlapped with its neighboring feathers more than it
uld have. Most studies of dried hummingbird wings wind up using wings that are under-spread. The
ead of this wing is pretty good overall, but it is p8 that in particular that is problematic. The result
t removing P8 barely impacted the wing’s surface area is clearly an artefact. A hummingbird’s
g, when properly spread, does not have a concave perimeter in the trailing edge— google images
ummingbirds in flight. In fact, google image search of ”Steve Zamek Anna’s hummingbird”, the
t image clearly shows an Anna’s Hummingbird in flight, in which P8 has mostly regrown (note the
e is clearly in sheathe), and you can see that the missing P8 clearly influences the back edge of
wing. A slightly underspread wing won’t affect some types of aerodynamic measurements all that
ch, but when the authors want to zoom in and focus on a subtle issue such as the contribution to
wing’s surface area of a single feather, as the present authors have done, then they need to work
h material suitable for the focus of their study.
ruyt et al 2014 provides a figure 2 of a bunch of spread hummingbird wings as an example, some
hese wings are quite good and the rest are slightly under-spread, just like the present author’s
g. Notice how the very best wings have a straight trailing edge, not a concave one. There should
e been a substantial gap in the wing in the P8 removal treatment. The fact that there isn’t a
in the present authors’ data indicates that all of their data for this experimental treatment is an
erimental artifact. I think the best solution to this problem is to drop this entire treatment from
analyses, since I didn’t find myself believing any of the author’s assertions about the P8 treatment,
where in the paper.
sponse: Thank you for your thoughtful comment. The P8 analysis was accordingly taken out of
manuscript and the text was changed accordingly.
mment 21: Lines 25-28 this is a bit of an oversimplification, I would not expect moult to always
t this much extra metabolic cost.
5
sponse: Please note that these metabolic costs of feather synthesis and body insulation during
ult were reported in a review of empirical studies (Walsberg, 1983) and we are unaware of other
dies reporting lower costs. We clearly note in the text (Page 2, Line 25) that these feather synthesis
body insulation costs do not concern possible additional costs related to elevated metabolism
ing flight due to lower wing surface of moulting birds (see below).
mment 22: Line 29: not necessarily - it depends on which definition of ”energy for flight” the
hors mean. Chai et al showed that moulting hummingbirds decrease mass, apparently in order to
uce flight costs. Might delete this statement, since energy for flight does not play a role in the
hor’s later arguments
sponse: Indeed, the definition of ”energy for flight” may result in different interpretations of
outcome of wing feather moult. Epting (Epting, 1980) suggested that reduced wing integrity
to moult will greatly increase the required power for hovering, and Chai (Chai, 1997) reported
ilar empirical findings resulting from mass-specific metabolic rates. Yet, the latter author also
onstrated that hummingbirds reduced their body mass during moult and consequently the power
ands that is required to lift the bird’s mass was concomitantly reduced (see below), resulting in
ilar ”energy for flight” calculations when considering the whole organism rather than mass-specific
mates. We added the information about how differences in the definition of energy for flight may
ult in differences in the interpretations of such findings (see our response to Comment #24 below).
mment 23: Figure 1: Strange to call the secondaries the ”root”-they are a part of the wing, the
e as the primaries. They are the arm wing rather than the hand wing.
sponse: Following this comment we revised the text and refrain from using the term wing root
instead use secondaries throughout the text.
mment 24: Page 4 Line 33– ”elevated metabolism”here and above– this is tricky and large parts
he literature are sloppy about this. Is it really elevated? Chai 1997 measured *mass specific*
abolism, and then found that as the birds decrease in mass, their mass specific metabolism in-
ased. But look at the numbers in Chai’s table 1. Multiply body mass by mass-specific metabolic
, and all three experimental treatments have essentially the same metabolic rate, if anything
abolism decLined in the ”moulting, intermediate wing area loss” treatment. Which value matters
he bird? I submit it’s more likely whole bird metabolism, rather than mass specific metabolism.
ting skinny reduces metabolic rate, not increases it.
sponse: We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment and completely agree with his/her
essment. Indeed, the interpretation of the results of Chai (Chai, 1997) depends on whether one
siders whole-bird or mass-specific metabolism. Since we did not measure bird metabolism and
e our inferences on simulations of the performance of wing models, we provide several different
narios related to plausible natural conditions, which include body mass reduction that takes place
ultaneously with wing moulting, as well as no such decrease in body mass. Please see also our
ponse to Comment #9. Regarding mass-specific versus whole organism metabolism: we added
rmation regarding these two perspectives in the text to present it to the reader (Page 2, Line 32).
mment 25: Line 43: reference 27 is unpublished, making it hard for me to evaluate these methods.
sponse: Please see our responses to Comments #2 & 18.
mment 26: Line 48: Male, or female? Adult, or hatch-year? They are sexually dimorphic, and
rphology varies with age.
sponse: The wing used was of adult male Anna’s hummingbird. The text was revised accordingly
ge 3, Line 55).
6
mment 27: Line 56–these are strange references for this assertion. There are studies on air trans-
sivity of bird wing feathers, cite those instead! Didn’t David Lentink have a paper on hummingbird
g air transmissivity? (or maybe that was just an idea for a project, I don’t recall a specific citation
uggest)
sponse: Following this comment we elaborate regarding this issue in the updated manuscript text
ge 4, Line 46):
vious studies suggested that hummingbird wings are rigid throughout the downstroke (Tobalske
al., 2007, M.Maeda et al., 2017, Tanaka et al., 2013). Moreover, it was demonstrated that the
osity of the wings has very little effect, if existing at all, on its performance (Kruyt et al., 2014,
melech and Ellington, 2013). The above justified the use of a rigid and non-porous 3D printed wing
del to analyse Anna’s hummingbird’s complete wing performance and aerodynamics. However, to
best of our knowledge, there is no published data regarding these properties (wing deformation and
transmissivity) for a hummingbird wing during active moult of its flight feathers. Therefore, the
g is assumed to be rigid and non-porous throughout the annual cycle for the purpose of presenting
rst attempt to understand the consequences of flight feather moult on the wing’s aerodynamic
formance. It is understood that the results presented herein might be an over estimation of the
g’s performance, which needs to be assessed by a designated research.
mment 28: Figure 2: The wing is slightly under-spread. When fully spread, the trailing edge is
ntially straight, whereas here the trailing edge is concave at around the tip of p8, p7, and p6. Not
essarily a fatal flaw here, but treatment D is biologically unrealistic.
sponse: See our response to Comment #20; This treatment was deleted from the updated version
he manuscript.
mment 29: Page 5 Line 36 assertion that feathers in contact with air are prone to wear and damage
aive and probably incorrect. At a minimum, back up this speculation with some references– there
large ornithological literature on how feathers wear. I submit that most wear in outer wing
hers comes from mechanical abrasion with substrates, except for that one white frigatebird Jedd
t had once – (Schreiber, R. W., E. A. Schreiber, A. M. Peele*, and E. H. Burtt, Jr. 2006. Pattern
damage to albino Great Frigatebird flight feathers supports hypothesis of abrasion by airborne
ticles. Condor 108: 736-741). But that albino bird was the exception that proves the rule.
sponse: We thank the reviewer for this important comment and we revised the text to make clear
t outer feathers are likely to wear mostly due to contact with substrates, while airborne particles
likely not very important for feather wear (Page 4 Line 36).
mment 30: Page 7 Line 15 ”of the manufacturing process described earlier” the manufacturing
cess was not described earlier– another unpublished paper was cited.
sponse: The manufacturing process was described in the section dealing with wing design in the
terials and Methods (Page 3 Line 54).
mment 31: Page 7 Line 17– what previous study? This statement should be supported by a
tion. also, delete the sentence ”this aspect will be investigated in a future study”, there is no point
aying that here.
sponse: Please see Achache et al., 2017. The text was accordingly deleted.
mment 32: Page 8 ”due to the increasing overlap...” this could be an artifact of an unrealistic
g preparation, this needs to be acknowledged in the text.
sponse: We examined numerous pictures of hummingbirds’ wings, including fully spread ones,
in all these wings an increasing feather overlap towards the tip is evident (Tanaka et al., 2013,
yt et al., 2015).
7
mment 33: Page 8 Lines 35-38– cite one of the Tobalske studies showing that hummingbirds
have an attached leading edge vortex, and modify this text accordingly. This unsteady spanwise
ticity concentrations that is formed and shed in the vicinity of the leading-edge.
sponse: In our published paper (Achache et al., 2017), we presented flow field measurements over
na’s hummingbird compete wing. Results indicated that a spanwise vorticity concentration formed
r the leading-edge, similarly to previously reported attached leading-edge vortex (e.g, Warrick
l., 2009). However, our higher-resolution measurements allowed us to discover that this spanwise
ticity concentration is unsteady, periodically formed and shed throughout the downstroke, therefore
bed a leading-edge bubble. In this bubble, the flow separates and creates a low-pressure region,
ilar to the one that evolved within the leading-edge vortex. The difference between the two is
t in the former, a vortex shedding evolves too, introducing more time-scales to this flow field
more frequencies). Since this evolution does not reach a steady state (like the one over a steady
nslating wing), the aerodynamic characteristics remain fruitful (i.e. high enough lift-to-torque ratio
noticeable lift).
mment 34: Page 8 Line 48– explain the meaning of coherence here in the context of vorticity, where
claimed that the vortices lose coherence– spatial coherence? Temporal coherence? Coherence with
wing, i.e. how it is attached with the wing? Coherence from one stroke to the next?
sponse: We thank the reviewer for his/hers comment. We aimed to present the temporal and spa-
development of the tip vortex throughout the downstroke. The wording was changed accordingly
learly describe the generation and breakdown of tip vortex (Page 9, Line 50). Please see Achache
l., 2017 for a similar analysis performed over the complete wing.
mment 35: Figure 5: I am confused, why is there a large region of detached flow in Figure 5A? is
to imply that the wing was highly inefficient at this orientation? Is this in any way representative
hummingbird in flight, or is this a complete experimental artifact? Why a regular wing should have
much drag, whereas a wing missing P10 should have so little, strikes me as likely to be inaccurate.
ecially as birds missing wing feathers likely change their kinematics, and thus comparing an intact
g to a wing missing feathers with the same kinematic conditions is not a perfectly valid example.
sponse: Implying drag from the standard deviation is not very reliable, especially in 3D flows.
ead, we measured the aerodynamic loads (see Figure 3A), which suggested that the complete wing
duced more drag than the wing that is missing its P10 flight feather. This can be explained by
higher lift the complete wing produced (which can also be seen by the circulation measurements
Figure 8), hence, it has a higher induced drag component, with roughly the same wing area. The
mingly large detached area and flow fluctuation appearing in Fig. 5 are one of the manifestation of
leading-edge bubble (in phase-averaged flow fields). See Comment #33 and Achache et al., 2017
ch explored the decomposition of these flow fields.
egarding wing kinematics, there is very little data on wingbeat kinematics of moulting humming-
s. Chai (Chai, 1997) reported that the wing stroke amplitude essentially stayed the same during
ult. We do not know if wingbeat kinematics changed or stayed the same during moult, but it is
ly that this angle of attack would be reached during the stroke regardless of whether the wing was
ulting or not.
mment 36: Pg 13 Line 55 this is unclear to me– are the authors really asserting that Sapir and
dley found no weight loss during moult? A word search on that paper for the word ’moult’ returns
hits. And why is no weight loss during moult a ”likely scenario”? Given that ALL published
dies on moult in hummingbirds suggest that weight goes down while moulting, I think the only
ly scenario is that anna’s hummingbird weight goes down as well. Also the authors are making
mewhat simplistic argument, to boot. It is well known that hummingbird body masses fluctuate
matically over the course of the day (Calder et al., 1990; Hou et al., 2015). It’s quite a bit more
n 10% per the statement on the next Page.
8
sponse: The citation of Sapir and Dudley (Sapir and Dudley, 2012) refers to the average body
ss of Anna’s hummingbirds that was recorded during non-moulting periods. Indeed, large variation
hummingbird body mass was found both when comparing moulting and non-moulting periods.
, due to the large uncertainties regarding the relationships between wing feather moult and body
ss decrease in hummingbirds (for example whether hummingbird body mass reduction exactly
cides with wing feather moult and the associated wing surface area reduction) and since the
dies that described the association between wing feather moult and body mass reduction were done
laboratory housed birds and not on wild ranging birds, we decided to examine several potential
narios that may take place in moulting Anna’s hummingbirds. One scenario describes no weight
at all during the period, a second one describes a 25% drop in body mass, and a third one a
body mass drop for the P10 moult stage. This allowed us to define clear limits to our analysis
t may represent real-world conditions in order to provide insights regarding Anna’s hummingbird
formance during moult. We hope that detailed empirical data regarding wing feather moult and
y mass variation in hummingbirds will be published in the future and this will allow refining our
erimental procedure.
dditionally, there are indeed large variations in hummingbird body mass during different parts of
day and we thank the reviewer for pointing it out. We consequently add this information in the
sed manuscript (Page 2, Line 50). We note that the different scenarios may represent different
ditions of moulting hummingbirds throughout the day, for example when a bird that reduced its
y mass during moult consumes large quantity of food before night-time, to an extent that may
similar to its body mass during periods when it does not moult. We elaborate on the possible
sequences of daily body mass variation in the revised text (Page 14, Line 10).
mment 37: Figure 9: Panel D is inaccurate. A given Anna’s hummingbird individual does not
nd 6 months moulting their wings. It’s 2 months, 3 tops. You are mistakening a range derived
m a population (earliest individuals are moulting in June, very late individuals are finishing moult
December) for what an individual does. But just because there are individuals in the population
ulting over a 6-month span does not mean that wing moult takes every individual 6 months! That’s
saying ”there are women pregnant any given point in time, therefore all women are pregnant all
time”. Males are on breeding territories in November and most individuals are full-feathered
luding finishing body moult) by then. See also (Pyle, 1997).
sponse: Thank you for your comment. We revised this entire section and removed this part of
analysis.
mment 38: Page 15, Line 6– something I’m not following here: what about increasing stroke
plitude? How are kinematic changes factored into this analysis?
sponse: According to Chai (Chai, 1997) the stroke amplitude does not change significantly during
ult. As we emphasised earlier, this is a first attempt to understand the underlying effects of flight
her moult on wing performance and, besides the study by Chai (Chai, 1997), we are not aware of
research that comprehensively measured the complete wing kinematics of a hummingbird during
ulting versus non-moulting periods. We hope that our research will encourage such examination.
mment 39: Page 15 Line 24 ”territorial clashes lessen until they cease altogether” – this is
orrect. What you mean to say is that the birds seem to reduce activity a bit and individuals that
been territorial sometimes lose their territories to other birds. They most definitely continue
peting for resources during the non-breeding season. (Ortiz-Crespo, 1980; Yeaton and Laughrin,
6).
sponse: Following this, and other comments, we substantially changed the text in this section of
manuscript and removed natural history extensions due to their speculative nature.
mment 40: Line 53 ”aggressive interactions are relatively rare during moult”. I disagree– when
ulting they don’t win as often, but aggressive interactions are still fairly frequent.
sponse: This text was changed (see our response to Comment #39 above).

Second round of reviewing
Yonathan Achache Nir Sapir Yossef Elimelech
January 5, 2018
r editors of the Royal Society Open Science journal,
thank the reviewers for accepting our manuscript entitled ”Hovering hummingbird wing aerody-
ics during the annual cycle: II. Implications of wing feather moult” (manuscript #RSOS-170184)
publication. As suggested by the reviewers, we proofed the manuscript and corrected grammatical
rs and typos. Below we also provide a point-by-point response to the reviewers’ comments.
view 1
mment 1: The authors have adequately addressed my concerns addressed in my previous review.
current version of the manuscript is nicely focused on the biomechanical results, and the removal
he speculative natural history applications have eliminated the serious distractions found in the
ier draft. Nice work! The authors do need to give this version of the manuscript a good read as
countered several grammatical errors in various places that should be corrected. The only point
m my previous review that I will revisit is the idea that ground effects could be an important
tegy for mounting birds. The authors claim, in their response to my comment, that hummingbirds
ly are stationary near the ground (or flat surface). This comment simply shows that the authors
ly have not spent much time watching hummingbirds in the wild. Hummingbirds forage frequently
low-lying herbaceous plants where ground effects could be quite useful. I am not requesting that
authors alter any content based on this comment, but perhaps it might be a good idea to spend
e time getting to know these creatures if they plan to continue using hummingbirds as a model
their work.
sponse: We thank the reviewer for his comments and insights which helped us to improve our
nuscript.

sponse: The text was corrected accordingly.
mment 3: Figure 2: add word ”male” to description of wing. I think it is important to emphasize
htly more that the analysis done here was for only one sex; sex differences were ignored. Although
ual dimorphism of wing morphology (of this species) is slight enough that it matters little to this
dy, there are a number of papers on hummingbird flight that use only males and imply their results
general to all hummingbirds when they may not be.
