24 16 ABSTRACT
25 17
26
27 18 India faces major environmental challenges associated with waste generation and inadequate waste
28
29
19 collection, transport, treatment and disposal. Current systems in India cannot cope with the volumes of waste
30 20 generated by an increasing urban population, and this impacts on the environment and public health. The
31
32 21 challenges and barriers are significant, but so are the opportunities. This paper reports on an International
33 22 seminar on “Sustainable Solid Waste Management for Cities: Opportunities in SAARC countries” organized
34
35 23 by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute
36
37 24 and the Royal Society. A priority is to move from reliance on waste dumps that offer no environmental
38 25 protection, to waste management systems that retain useful resources within economy. Waste segregation at
39
40 26 source and use of specialized waste processing facilities to separate recyclable materials has a key role.
41
42
27 Disposal of residual waste after extraction of material resources needs engineered landfill sites and/or
43 28 investment in energy from waste facilities. The potential for energy generation, from landfill via methane
44
45 29 extraction or thermal treatment, is a major opportunity, but a key barrier is the shortage of qualified
46 30 engineers and environmental professionals with the experience to deliver improved waste management
47
48 31 systems in India.

5 40
6
7 41 Solid Waste Management (SWM) is a major problem for many urban local bodies (ULB) in India, where
8
9 42 urbanization, industrialization and economic growth have resulted in increased municipal solid waste
10 43 (MSW) generation per person (PPCB, 2010). Effective SWM is a major challenge in cities with high
11
12 44 population density. Achieving sustainable development within a country experiencing rapid population
13
45 growth and improvements in living standards is made more difficult in India because it is a diverse country
14
15 46 with many different religious groups, cultures and traditions (World Bank, 2012).
16
17 47 Despite significant development in social, economic and environmental areas, SWM systems in
18 48 India have remained relatively unchanged. The informal sector have a key role in extracting value from
19
20 49 waste, with ~90% of residual waste currently being dumped rather than properly landfilled (Narayan, 2008).
21
22 50 There is an urgent need to move to more sustainable SWM, and this requires new management systems and
23 51 waste management facilities. Current SWM systems are inefficient with waste having a negative impact on
24
25 52 public health, the environment and the economy (Biswas et al., 2010). The waste Management and Handling
26
53 Rules in India introduced by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) in 2000, although compliance
27
28 54 is variable and limited.
29
30 55 This paper reviews the challenges, barriers and opportunities associated with improving waste
31 56 management in India. It is the output from an International seminar on “Sustainable Solid Waste
32
33 57 Management for Cities: Opportunities in SAARC countries” organized by the Council of Scientific and
34
35 58 Industrial Research-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) held in Nagpur
36 59 in 2015.

61 2. Waste generation in India
40
41 62
42
43 63 India is experiencing rapid urbanization while remaining a country with physical, climatic, geographical,
44 64 ecological, social, cultural and linguistic diversity (Bhalla et al., 2013). The population of India was 1,210
45
46 65 million in 2011, compared to 1,028 million in 2001 (Census of India, 2011). Population growth is a major
47
48 66 contributor to increasing MSW in India.
49 67
50
51 68 2.1. Growth of Mega Cities in India
52
69 Mega-cities are a relatively recent phenomenon, associated with the globalization of the economy, culture and
53
54 70 technology (ISWA 2012). Mega-cities in India include Ahmedabad (6.3 million), Hyderabad (7.7 million),
55
56 71 Bangalore (8.4 million), Chennai (8.6 million), Kolkata (14.1 million), Delhi (16.3 million) and Greater

2 72 Mumbai (18.4 million, Census of India, 2011). These have dynamic economic growth and high waste
3
4 73 generation per capita (ISWA, 2012) as shown in Table 1.
5 74
6
7 75 2.2. Infrastructure Development for Public Health and Protection of the Environment
8
9 76 Improvements in civil infrastructure are required for India to become a world leading economy. Developing
10 77 high quality infrastructure that meets the needs of the people and protects the environment is fundamental to
11
12 78 achieving effective economic growth (World Economic Forum, 2010). Waste management infrastructure has
13
79 an important role in delivering sustainable development (ISWA, 2012). Rapid population growth in India has
14
15 80 led to depletion of natural resources. Wastes are potential resources and effective waste management with
16
17 81 resource extraction is fundamental to effective SWM. Value extraction from waste can be materials, energy
18 82 or nutrients and this can provide a livelihood for many people (ISWA, 2012). The transition from wastes to
19
20 83 resources can only be achieved through investment in SWM as this depends on a coordinated set of actions
21
22 84 to develop markets and maximize recovery of reusable/recyclable materials (Sridevi et al., 2012). Materials,
23 85 energy and nutrient recovery must be the aim of future SWM infrastructure development in India. Resources
24
25 86 can be recovered from wastes using existing technologies and India has an extremely effective recycling
26
87 tradition. The “scrap dealer” systems produce recycled materials through an extensive and well-coordinated
27
28 88 network across the country.
29
30 89
31 90 2.3. Statistics on Waste Generation and Waste Characterization Data
32
33 91 Estimating the quantity and characteristics of MSW in India and forecasting future waste generation is
34
35 92 fundamental to successful waste management planning (Rana et al., 2014). The quantity of MSW generated
36 93 depends on standard of living, extent and type of commercial activity, eating habits and season (Kaushal et
37
38 94 al., 2012). India generates ~133,760 tonnes of MSW per day, of which ~91,152 tonnes is collected and
39
95 ~25,884 tonnes is treated (CPCB Report, 2012). MSW generation per capita in India ranges from ~0.17
40
41 96 kg/person/day in small towns to ~0.62 kg/day in cities as shown in Table 2 (NEERI, 2005).
42
43 97 Waste generation rate depends on factors such as population density, economic status,
44 98 (HIG/MIG/LIG /slum), level of commercial activity, culture and city/region. Figure 1 shows data on MSW
45
46 99 generation in different states, indicating high waste generation in Maharashtra (115,364-19,204 tonnes/day),
47
48 100 Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal (11,523-15,363 tonnes/day), Andhra Pradesh, Kerala (7,683-
49 101 11,522 tonnes/day) and Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka and Mizoram (3,842-7,662
50
51 102 tonnes/day). Lower waste generation occurs in Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa,
52
103 Goa, Assam, Arunanchal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Tripura, Nagaland and Manipur (<3,841tonnes/day).

2 106 The local economy impacts on waste composition, as high income groups use more packaged products,
3
4 107 resulting in higher volumes of plastics, paper, glass, metals and textiles. Changes in waste composition can
5 108 have a significant impact on waste management practices (Sridevi et al., 2013). MSW may also contain
6
7 109 hazardous wastes such as pesticides, paints, used medicine and batteries. Compostable organics include
8
9 110 fruits, vegetables and food waste. Healthcare waste contains disposable syringes, sanitary materials and
10 111 blood containing textiles (Mathur, 2012, Bhala et al., 2003) and is governed by the Biomedical Waste
11
12 112 (Management and Handling) Rules 1998 and the Amended Rules, 2003, and should not be mixed with
13
113 MSW. The average composition of MSW produced by Indian cities is ~41 wt.% organic, ~40 wt.% inert
14
15 114 with ~19 wt.% potentially recyclable materials as shown in Table 3 (Singh et al., 2011). Most organic waste
16
17 115 is generated from households and inert waste is generated from construction, demolition road sweeping.
18 116 Waste samples collected from Delhi, Ahmadabad and Bangalore (Rawat et al., 2013) indicate that MSW
19
20 117 composition varies between cities (Kumar et al., 2009).
21
22 118
23 119 2.5. Predictions on Future Waste Growth
24
25 120 World waste production is expected to be ~27 billion tonnes per year by 2050, a third of which will come
26
121 from Asia, with major contributions from China and India (Modak, 2010). Waste generation in urban areas
27
28 122 of India will be 0.7 kg/person/day in 2025, ~4 to 6 times higher than in 1999 (World Bank, 1999). The
29
30 123 problems associated with waste become more acute as the size of communities increase (Kumar et al., 2011)
31 124 and this provides opportunities for decentralized waste management by self-help groups and NGOs. The
32
33 125 waste produced in urban areas of India is ~170,000 tonnes per day, equivalent to about 62 million tonnes per
34
35 126 year, and this is expected to increase by 5% per year due to increases in population and changing lifestyles
36 127 (Planning Commission, 2014). Table 4 shows that urban India generated 31.6 million tonnes of waste in
37
38 128 2001 and is currently generating 47.3 million tonnes. By 2041 waste generation will be 161 million tonnes, a
39
129 fivefold increase in four decades (Annepu et al., 2012).

43 131 3. Current Waste Management in India
44 132
45
46 133 3.1. Key waste management legislations in India
47
48 134 The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) issued MSW (Management and Handling) Rules 2000 to
49 135 ensure proper waste management in India and new updated draft rules have recently been published (MSW
50
51 136 (Management and Handling) Rules 2015). Municipal authorities are responsible for implementing these rules
52
137 and developing infrastructure for collection, storage, segregation, transportation, processing and disposal of
53
54 138 MSW. Chandigarh is the first city to develop SWM in a planned way and has improved waste management
55
56 139 compared to other Indian cities (Rana et al., 2015).

2 141 3.2. Role of the informal sector in waste materials reuse and recycling
3
4 142 The informal sector has a very important role in India (Mathur, 2012) and this must be integrated into formal
5 143 SWM systems (Annepu et al., 2012). The informal sector is characterized by small-scale, labour-intensive,
6
7 144 largely unregulated and unregistered low-technology manufacturing or provision of materials and services
8
9 145 (Wilson et al., 2001). Waste pickers collect household or commercial/industrial waste and many hundreds of
10 146 thousands of waste pickers in India depend on waste for an income, despite the associated health and social
11
12 147 issues (Wilson et al., 2006). Pickers extract potential value from waste bins, trucks, streets, waterways and
13
148 dumpsites. Some work in recycling plants owned by co-operatives or waste picker associations. Waste
14
15 149 picking is often the only source of income for families and provides a livelihood for significant numbers of
16
17 150 urban poor (ISWA, 2012). Waste pickers provide usable materials to other enterprises. In Pune waste pickers
18 151 collect organic waste for composting and biogas generation. Waste pickers also make a significant
19
20 152 contribution by helping to keep cities clean.
21
22 153 A recent study of six Indian cities found that waste pickers recovered approximately 20% of waste
23 154 (GTZ/CWG2007), with 80,000 people involved in recycling ~3 million tonnes. It is estimated that every
24
25 155 tonne of recyclable material collected saved the urban local body ~ INR 24,500 per annum and avoided the
26
156 emission of 721 kg CO2 per annum (Annepu et al., 2012).
27
28 157
29
30 158 3.3. Waste Collection and Transport
31 159 Waste collection, storage and transport are essential elements of any SWM system and can be major
32
33 160 challenges in cities (US EPA, 2002). Waste collection is the responsibility of the Municipal Corporations in
34
35 161 India, and bins are normally provided for biodegradable and inert waste (Guria et al., 2010, Das et al., 2014,
36 162 Bhoyar et al., 1999). Mixed biodegradable and inert waste is often dumped with open burning a common
37
38 163 practice. Improvements to waste collection and transport infrastructure in India will create jobs, improve
39
164 public health and increase tourism (US EPA, 2002). Local bodies spend around Rs. 500-1000 per tonne on
40
41 165 SWM with 70% of this amount spent on collection and 20% spent on transport.
42
43 166
44 167 3.4. Waste Disposal
45
46 168 SWM disposal is at a critical stage of development in India. There is a need to develop facilities to treat and
47
48 169 dispose of increasing amounts of MSW (Sharholy et al. 2008). More than 90% of waste in India is dumped
49 170 in an unsatisfactory manner (Das et al. 1998) and it is estimated that ~1,400 km2 was occupied by waste
50
51 171 dumps in 1997. This is expected to increase in the future, as shown in Figure 2 (Singhal and Pandey, 2001).
52
172 Properly engineered waste disposal protects public health and preserves key environmental resources
53
54 173 such as ground water, surface water, soil fertility and air quality. Indian cities with containment landfill sites
55
56 174 include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Nashik, Vadodra, Jamshedpur, Allahabad, Amritsar, Rajkot, Shimla,

10 180 3.5. Environmental and health impacts of waste dumping
11
12 181 Waste dumps have adverse impacts to the environment and public health (Rathi, 2006; Sharholy et al., 2005;
13
182 Ray et al., 2005; Jha et al., 2003; Kansal, 2002; Kansal et al., 1998; Gupta et al., 1998). Open dumps release
14
15 183 methane from decomposition of biodegradable waste under anaerobic conditions. Methane causes fires and
16
17 184 explosions and is a major contributor to global warming (Sridevi et al., 2012). There are also problems
18 185 associated with odour and migration of leachates to receiving waters (Srivastava et al., 2014). Odour is a
19
20 186 serious problem, particularly during summer when average temperatures in India can exceed 45°C (Dasgupta
21
22 187 et al., 2013). Discarded tyres at dumps collect water, allowing mosquitoes to breed, increasing the risk of
23 188 diseases such as malaria, dengue and West Nile fever. Uncontrolled burning of waste at dump sites releases
24
25 189 fine particles which are a major cause of respiratory disease and cause smog (Sridevi et al., 2012). Open
26
190 burning of MSW and tyres emits 22,000 tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere around Mumbai every year
27
28 191 (Annepu et al., 2012). The impacts of poor waste management on public health are well documented, with
29
30 192 increased incidences of nose, throat and infections, breathing difficulties, inflammation, bacterial infections,
31 193 anemia, reduced immunity, allergies, asthma and other infections (CPCB, 2000).
32
33 194
34
35 195 4. Engineered landfills in India
36 196
37
38 197 The UN Environmental Program (UNEP) defines landfill as the controlled disposal of MSW on land in such
39
198 a way that contact between waste and the environment is significantly reduced, with waste disposal
40
41 199 concentrated in a well-defined area. Engineered landfill allows the safe disposal of residual MSW on land
42
43 200 but protects ground and surface water from pollution and avoids air emissions, wind-blown litter, odour, fire
44 201 hazards, problems with animals, birds and other pests/rodents, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions and
45
46 202 slope instability issues (Management and Handling Rule 2015). Properly managed engineered landfills
47
48 203 should replace dumps in India. This would significantly reduce the environmental impact of waste (UNEP,
49 204 2005).

52
206 5. Waste to energy in India
53
54 207
55
56 208 The problems associated with improper waste disposal could be significantly mitigated by requiring material
57 209 recovery. Source separation of inert and high moisture content fractions would maximize potential for
58
59
60 6
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 7 of 22 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2 210 thermal recovery and other treatment options in India. The waste processed in thermal recovery is residual
3
4 211 waste that remains after all commercially viable recyclable materials have been extracted. Waste to energy
5 212 technologies produce energy, recover materials and free land that would otherwise be used for dumping
6
7 213 (India: Renewable Energy Sector, 2013). The composition of residual waste is important for energy recovery
8
9 214 (Khatib et al., 2010) and waste composition is changing in India, with the amount of high calorific waste
10 215 generally increasing. A significant increase in the use of waste to energy technologies has been proposed
11
12 216 (Planning Commission report Waste to Energy, 2014) but this depends on location, climate, demographics
13
217 and other socioeconomic factors (Srivastava et al., 2014; Gomez et al., 2009).
14
15 218 The most widely used waste to energy technology for residual waste uses combustion to provide
16
17 219 combined heat and power (CHP) (World Energy Council 2013). Adopting maximum recycling with waste to
18 220 energy in an integrated waste management system would significantly reduce dumping in India (Planning
19
20 221 Commission 2014). Waste to energy technologies are available that can process unsegregated low-calorific
21
22 222 value waste, and industry is keen to exploit these technologies in India. Several waste to energy projects
23 223 using combustion of un-segregated low-calorific value waste are currently being developed. Alternative
24
25 224 thermal treatment processes to combustion include gasification, pyrolysis, production of refuse derived fuel
26
225 (RDF) and gas-plasma technology.
27
28 226 Waste to energy development in India is based on a build, operate and transfer (BOOT) model
29
30 227 (India: Renewable Energy Sector, 2013). Increased waste to energy would reduce disposal to land and
31 228 generate clean, reliable energy from a renewable fuel source, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and
32
33 229 reducing GHG emissions. In addition, generation of energy from waste would have significant social and
34
35 230 economic benefits for India. However, the track record of waste to energy in India highlights some of the
36 231 difficulties. The vast majority of facilities have not worked effectively due to various operational and design
37
38 232 problems. For example, the first large scale MSW incinerator built at Timarpur, New Delhi in 1987 had a
39
233 capacity to process 300 tonnes/day and cost Rs. 250 million (US$5. 7 million). The plant failed because of
40
41 234 poor waste segregation, seasonal variations in waste composition and properties, inappropriate technology
42
43 235 selection and operational and maintenance issues (Indo-UK Seminar Report, 2015). Despite this type of
44 236 experience waste to energy will have a key role in future waste management in India.
45
46 237
47
48 238 6. Barriers to improved waste management in India
49 239
50
51 240 The current status of SWM in India is poor because the best and most appropriate methods from waste
52
241 collection to disposal are not being used. There is a lack of training in SWM and the availability of qualified
53
54 242 waste management professionals is limited. There is also a lack of accountability in current SWM systems
55
56 243 throughout India (Khajuria et al., 2010). Municipal authorities are responsible for managing MSW in India
57 244 but have budgets that are insufficient to cover the costs associated with developing proper waste collection,
58
59
60 7
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 22
1
2 245 storage, treatment and disposal. The lack of strategic MSW plans, waste collection/segregation and a
3
4 246 government finance regulatory framework are major barriers to achieving effective SWM in India.
5 247 Limited environmental awareness combined with low motivation has inhibited innovation and the
6
7 248 adoption of new technologies that could transform the way wastes are managed in India. Public attitudes to
8
9 249 waste are also a major barrier to improving SWM in India.
10 250
11
12 251 7. Changes required to improve waste management in India
13
252
14
15 253 Core to the vision for waste management in India is the use of wastes as resources with increased value
16
17 254 extraction, recycling, recovery and reuse. Urban local bodies (ULBs) need to be responsible for waste
18 255 management, with the ULB Commissioner and Chairman directly responsible for performance of waste
19
20 256 management systems. Waste management needs to be regarded throughout Indian society as an essential
21
22 257 service requiring sustainable financing. The case presented to a ULB for a properly funded system must
23 258 demonstrate the advantages of sound investment in waste management.
24
25 259 A strong and independent authority is needed to regulate waste management if SWM is to improve
26
260 in India. Without clear regulation and enforcement improvements will not happen. Strong waste regulations
27
28 261 can drive innovation. The waste management sector needs to include attractive and profitable businesses
29
30 262 with clear performance requirements imposed by the ULB and financial penalties applied when waste
31 263 management services are not working effectively. Finance for waste management companies and funding for
32
33 264 infrastructure must be raised from waste producers through a waste tax. An average charge of one rupee per
34
35 265 person per day would generate close to 50,000 Crores annually and this level of funding would probably be
36 266 sufficient to provide effective waste management throughout India.
37
38 267 Information on future quantities and characterisation of wastes is essential as this determines the
39
268 appropriateness of different waste management and treatment options. State level procurement of equipment
40
41 269 and vehicles is necessary for primary and secondary collection with effective systems for monitoring
42
43 270 collection, transport and disposal.
44 271 Littering and waste in streets is a major problem in India that has serious impacts on public health.
45
46 272 Nagpur has introduced a system for sweeping roads in which every employee sweeps a fixed road length.
47
48 273 And the Swatchata Doot Aplya Dari (sanitary worker at your doorstep) scheme of the Centre for
49 274 Development Communication was selected as an example of good practice by UN HABITAT in 2007.
50
51 275 Waste management must involve waste segregation at source to allow much more efficient value
52
276 extraction and recycling. Separating dry (inorganic) and wet (biodegradable) waste would have significant
53
54 277 benefits and should be the responsibility of the waste producer.
55
56 278 Long-term waste management planning requires visionary project development by ULBs, the private
57 279 sector and NGOs. The roles and responsibilities to deliver sustainable systems need to be defined, with
58
59
60 8
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 9 of 22 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2 280 monitoring and evaluation to monitor progress. Experiences should be shared between different regions of
3
4 281 India and different social groups. There are a number of research institutes, organizations, NGOs, and private
5 282 sector companies working on a holistic approach to SWM and future waste management in India must
6
7 283 involve extensive involvement of the informal sector throughout the system.
8
9 284 There is a need to develop training and capacity building at every level. All Indian school children should
10 285 know about waste management, the effects of poor waste management on the environment and public health,
11
12 286 and the role and responsibilities of each individual in the waste management system. This will develop
13
287 responsible citizens who regard waste as a resource opportunity.
14
15 288
16
17 289 8. Conclusions
18 290
19
20 291 Population growth and particularly the development of mega-cities is making solid waste management in
21
22 292 India a major problem. The current situation is that India relies on inadequate waste infrastructure, the
23 293 informal sector and waste dumping. There are major issues associated with public participation in waste
24
25 294 management and there is generally a lack of responsibility towards waste in the community. There is a need
26
295 to cultivate community awareness and change the attitude of people towards waste as this is fundamental to
27
28 296 developing proper and sustainable waste management systems. Sustainable and economically viable waste
29
30 297 management must ensure maximum resource extraction from waste, combined with safe disposal of residual
31 298 waste through the development of engineered landfill and waste to energy facilities. India faces challenges
32
33 299 related to waste policy, waste technology selection and the availability of appropriately trained people in the
34
35 300 waste management sector. Until these fundamental requirements are met India will continue to suffer from
36 301 poor waste management and the associated impacts on public health and the environment.

We would like to thank the editor and reviewers for taking the time and effort to review our
paper, Challenges and opportunities associated with waste management in India that, has
been accepted for publication in publication in the journal Royal Society Open Science.
We have addressed the reviewer’s comments as below:
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
A clear and well-presented paper with minor errors and omissions. Thank you
Would benefit from inclusion of SAARC in full. SAARC is the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC). It includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and
Afghanistan. The text has been changed.
Table numbers require changing to numbers in text match numbers on tables. This has been
completed and is now correct.
Section 2.5 assumes that waste generation in 2011 is the same as it is now, considering population
growth this is highly unlikely and should be reviewed. Section 2.5 has been reviewed and is
corrected.
When considering future waste arisings statements should not be definitive, perhaps estimated may
be better. We now say predicted to be….
Grammar should be reviewed to ensure sentences have subjects eg line 171 This.... Sentences have
been changed to correct this problem.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The reviewed paper attempts to evaluate the challenges and opportunities associated with waste
management in India.
Paper’s strength is the major review that carried out associated with improving waste management
in India.
The main weaknesses of the paper are the following:
1. There are a few errors in the manuscript (please see the attached PDF file) All corrections
noted in the pdf have been corrected in the resubmitted version of the paper.
2. The references should be placed at the end of the sentence (please see at Page 3 of 22 etc.)
This has been done.
3. The acronyms HIG/MIG should be explained (Page 4 of 22). These were removed as they are
not necessary.
4. The ‘sources’ should be given as ‘references’ in the titles of tables (c.f. page 20). All
corrected.
5. It should be ‘waste-to-energy’ instead of ‘waste to energy’. Corrected throughout.
The authors must ensure that the manuscript is grammatically correct and without spelling or
typographical errors. For corrections, comments and more details, please see the attached pdf file.
We have thoroughly reread the paper to check for any grammatical errors and as far as we can see it
is correct.
