This manuscript is interesting, informative and well-written.There are a couple of points to
address:
1. Page 9, please include the range of stimulation voltage/ currents used.
2. The phrase "high active state" may be confusing to some readers. The muscle activation is a
function of the calcium concentration in the muscle, whereas it appears that in this manuscript
the "high active state" refers to bound cross-bridges that have been stretched and so have
developed a higher force. These two features are different, and so the terminology used int he
manuscript should not lead the reader to confusion or ambiguity.
3. Lines 270-277. The residual force enhancement comes from the titin interactions, that are
initially set at the moment of activation. As the muscle is actively stretched these forces from the
titin would increase, but presumably the residual forces would return to zero during the
concentric phase as the muscle returns to the initial length at which it was activated. If this is true,
then you would expect the effects of residual force enhancement to be negligible (zero) by time
points T4 and T5, even without having to invoke force depression. Please clarify what is meant by
"force depression" and discuss these points further.

It seems fundamentally important to me to use the ultrasound data to show that a significant

of the lengthening of the muscle-tendon unit. Depending on the level of force and the compliance
of the tendon, it is possible that fascicles could shorten during lengthening of the whole-muscle
tendon unit (although this seems unlikely at low stimulation intensity). The fact that fascicles
were not at different lengths at the onset of concentric contraction does not tell us about the
preceding length change. You have the data, so it should be relatively straight-forward to
calculate the stretch of fascicles and comment on whether it is in agreement with your finding
that there was residual force enhancement.
There is an important issue that is highlighted by the paragraph starting at line 278. Here you
state that, at the onset of concentric contraction, the muscle fascicle length and joint angle were
the same, and therefore tendon length must be the same. However, the joint torque was
significantly greater from ECC to TRAN to ISO, implying that the force exerted on the tendon by
muscle must be greater in ECC and TRANS. Given the known elastic nature of this tendon, the
increase in force must be associated with an increase in length of the tendon. This is an issue for
all measured time point where torques/forces were different across conditions but muscle
architecture was not. This issue is not trivial because changes in tendon stretch/recoil would
influence muscle fascicle velocities, which has important implications for muscle force
production. This issue is of course clouded by the fact that you are measuring fascicle length from
one muscle but stimulating at least three, one of which (Soleus) is much larger in terms of PCSA
then medial gastrocnemius and therefore may have more influence over force production. It is
conceivable that there are differences in the length changes of soleus between conditions that are
influencing the force exerted on the tendon and the torque output at the joint level. At the very
least, I think these issues warrant discussion.

Comments to the Author:
I have now received reviews of your manuscript by two experts. The reviewers have commented
that the study has been well-conducted and is well-written overall, and makes a solid and timely
contribution to the literature. Reviewer 1 raises a few points to address in revision, requesting
some additional information and clarification of terminology, and asking the authors to clarify
their interpretation of the residual force enhancement data, especially whether or not force
depression is required to explain the observed lack of force enhancement in T4 and T5.
Reviewer 2 raises the important concern that the authors need to provide direct evidence that
significant stretch of the fascicles occurred during the eccentric portion of the contraction,
especially considering the known series elasticity present in the plantar flexor muscles. This
concern is critical to the interpretation of the data and the conclusions drawn, so it must be fully
addressed for the manuscript to be considered for publication in RSOS.
Finally, Reviewer 2 raises an additional concern about the interpretation of fascicle and tendon
lengths at the onset of concentric contraction, considering the differing joint torques observed
between ECC, TRAN and ISO. The authors need to provide further information and discussion
on how to reconcile the apparent inconsistencies, which also likely involves some further
discussion and acknowledgment of the limitation of the current work.
If the authors feel that they can fully address the concerns raised, I would be happy to see a
resubmission of a revised version of the manuscript, along with a point-by-point response the
reviews.

I am satisfied that the author's responses adequately address my original concerns. It seems
reasonable that, for such small increments in torque, any additional tendon elongation would be
small (~1 mm) and potentially not detectable by subtraction of fascicle length from MTU length. I
am pleased to see the inclusion of fascicle length data plots in the results.

We are glad to hear your feedback and summary regarding our manuscript and revised comments. We
have replied to each comment as follows. We hope our revisions improve the quality of our manuscript.
Responses to reviewer #1
We appreciate your review comments. Thanks to your comments, the quality of our manuscript would
be improved. We have provided the reply to your comments. In the [Revised manuscript], the points
where we changed are highlighted by yellow.
Comment 1]
Page 9, please include the range of stimulation voltage/ currents used.
Response]
Thank you for your suggestion. Regrettably, we did not measure stimulation voltage and/or current in
his experiment. This is because resistance (caused by skin, fat, and/or muscle and so on) should be
ubstantially different among subjects, stimulation voltage alone cannot be used as a reference (index)
of contraction intensity. As far as we can remember, the range of stimulation voltage would be within
20-50 volts.
Comment 2]
The phrase "high active state" may be confusing to some readers. The muscle activation is a function of
he calcium concentration in the muscle, whereas it appears that in this manuscript the "high active state"
efers to bound cross-bridges that have been stretched and so have developed a higher force. These two
eatures are different, and so the terminology used in the manuscript should not lead the reader to
confusion or ambiguity.
Response]
Thank you for your comments. We totally agree with your comment. When we prepared this manuscript,
we considered that which words (i.e., active state or elongation of attached cross bridge) was appropriate
n this manuscript. We knew that many researchers have used the word of “active state” as “activation
evel of muscle, i.e., the magnitude of Ca2+ concentration in the muscle fibers” as you mentioned.
However, some researchers who published the stretch-shortening cycle papers have used “active state”
as the “magnitude of muscle force/torque (especially at the onset of shortening)” (Bobbert and Casius
2005, Arakawa et al. 2010). This definition includes the effect of elastic energy stored in the attached
crossbridges. Based on the situation that some stretch-shortening cycle researchers seem to be familiar
with the word of active state, we selected the word of “active state” in our manuscript. However, as you
pointed out, the word (definition) of active state is ambiguous in our context. Thus, according to your
Overall. All revised points are highlighted as yellow)

Comment 3]
Lines 270-277. The residual force enhancement comes from the titin interactions, that are initially set at
he moment of activation. As the muscle is actively stretched these forces from the titin would increase,
but presumably the residual forces would return to zero during the concentric phase as the muscle returns
o the initial length at which it was activated. If this is true, then you would expect the effects of residual
orce enhancement to be negligible (zero) by time points T4 and T5, even without having to invoke
orce depression. Please clarify what is meant by "force depression" and discuss these points further.
Response]
Thank you for your comment. Regarding this point, we think that negative effect (i.e., residual force
depression, which is considered to be caused by the deformation of actin filaments due to active
hortening) can mask the positive effect (i.e., residual force enhancement). In addition, there is a
possibility that positive effect itself disappeared by active shortening. Regarding this point, there is two
possible explanations. First, after the end of active shortening (T4 and T5), muscle length became short
PF15). As consequently, muscle fibers should work at the ascending limb at T4 and T5. In this region,
he influence of residual force enhancement (i.e., titin stiffness) should become small because the
magnitude of titin elongation is small or negligible. Second, residual force enhancement (increased titin
tiffness) disappears by active shortening (although the possible reason has not proposed). We consider
hat the first explanation is more reasonable. This point can be clarified by conducting a similar
experiment adopting much longer muscle length even at the end of active shortening because this
experiment can emphasizes the influence of residual force enhancement (i.e., titin stiffness). We have
added these explanations in the manuscript. (Page 18, Line 287 to 301)
Responses to reviewer #2
We appreciate your review comments. We have considered all of your comments and suggestions, and
our responses have been provided below. We hope these responses are appropriate to your comments
and suggestions. In the [Revised manuscript], the points where we changed are highlighted by yellow.
Comment 1]
t seems fundamentally important to me to use the ultrasound data to show that a significant stretch of
he fascicles occurred during the eccentric portion of contractions. In muscles with significant series
compliance like the plantarflexors, the tendon can be responsible for some or all of the lengthening of
he muscle-tendon unit. Depending on the level of force and the compliance of the tendon, it is possible
hat fascicles could shorten during lengthening of the whole-muscle tendon unit (although this seems
unlikely at low stimulation intensity). The fact that fascicles were not at different lengths at the onset of
concentric contraction does not tell us about the preceding length change. You have the data, so it should
be relatively straight-forward to calculate the stretch of fascicles and comment on whether it is in
agreement with your finding that there was residual force enhancement.
Response]
According to your comment, we have added the data about elongation of the fascicle (Added Figure 4).
We can say strongly that the fascicle was elongated substantially during eccentric contraction phases
all subjects showed the fascicle elongation in both TRAN and ECC conditions). This result shows
active lengthening of muscle fibers-induced phenomena, that is, residual force enhancement and
elongation of attached crossbridges occurred in our experimental setting. In addition, magnitude of
ascicle lengthening was similar between TRAN and ECC conditions, indicating that same magnitude
of residual force enhancement and elongation of attached crossbridges occurred at the end of active
engthening in our experimental setting. We have added these explanations in the manuscripts. (Page
18-19, Line 302-309)
Comment 2]
There is an important issue that is highlighted by the paragraph starting at line 278. Here you state that,
at the onset of concentric contraction, the muscle fascicle length and joint angle were the same, and
herefore tendon length must be the same. However, the joint torque was significantly greater from ECC
o TRAN to ISO, implying that the force exerted on the tendon by muscle must be greater in ECC and
TRANS. Given the known elastic nature of this tendon, the increase in force must be associated with an
ncrease in length of the tendon. This is an issue for all measured time point where torques/forces were
different across conditions but muscle architecture was not. This issue is not trivial because changes in
endon stretch/recoil would influence muscle fascicle velocities, which has important implications for
muscle force production. This issue is of course clouded by the fact that you are measuring fascicle
ength from one muscle but stimulating at least three, one of which (Soleus) is much larger in terms of
PCSA then medial gastrocnemius and therefore may have more influence over force production. It is
conceivable that there are differences in the length changes of soleus between conditions that are
nfluencing the force exerted on the tendon and the torque output at the joint level. At the very least, I
hink these issues warrant discussion.
Thank you for your comment. We also assumed that because tendon has compliance to some extent, it
s reasonable to speculate that tendon length should be different when the joint torque is different.
However this was not observed in our experiment. Similar results (tendon length was not different
although joint torque was different) have been observed in the recent studies (Seiberl et al. 2010, Tilp et
al. 2011, Power et al. 2012). Regarding this point, first of all, we have to mention the fact that we (and
almost all previous studies reporting tendon elongation) did NOT measure tendon length “directly” (just
estimated it from joint angle changes and fascicle length changes). Thus, it may be difficult to mention
he tendon length changes precisely. Based on this situation, our current thought is that, as have
mentioned in our manuscript, relatively low contraction intensity (25%MVC) would be the one of
easons. Because 25%MVC was adopted in this study, the magnitude of joint torque difference was not
o large among condition (e.g., the largest difference observed at the time point T1 was about 10 Nm,
which was corresponding to ~8%MVC). This speculation is supported by the data that the tendon
elongation during isometric contractions measured “directly” by using MRI was 3% for free tendon and
2% for aponeurosis in the 60% MVC condition (Iwanuma et al. 2011). Thus, the elongation of tendon
ength by about 10%MVC would be very small or maybe negligible. In addition, even in the 100%MVC
conditions which means that larger joint torque difference should be observed (Seiberl et al. 2010, Tilp
et al. 2011, Power et al. 2012), no difference in fascicle length (tendon length) were observed although
oint torque was different. These data indicate that tendon length changes do not behave simply as a
unction of muscle force/joint torque. We speculate that larger fascicle shortening observed at the early
phase of isometric contraction (judging from joint angle changes) would be caused by eliminating slack,
not tendon elongation. For example, the fascicle shortening observed during the eccentric contraction
phase (judging from joint angle changes) in this study would be caused by just eliminating slack, not
endon elongation. The reason why we think so is that when we conducted preliminary isometric
contractions (=eliminating slack) before eccentric contractions, all subjects in all trials showed no
ascicle shortening during eccentric contractions although joint torque was increased substantially after
he initiation of eccentric contraction (unpublished data). In addition, when we did not conduct
preliminary isometric contractions (=eliminating slack) before eccentric contractions, even single twitch
=very weak contractions which seem to be too small to elongate tendon substantially) could induce
ascicle shortening during eccentric contractions (unpublished data). Thus, although we agree with your
dea that tendon (rather, all materials) has compliance to some extent, we believe that fascicle length
changes “do not necessarily” represent the (substantial) tendon length changes. Part of these explanation

Regarding the concern about different muscles (i.e., lateral gastrocnemius and soleus), we agree that
hese muscles may potentially behave differentially during contractions, it is difficult to assume that
“these different behaviors among muscles” change “among conditions”. Thus, authors consider that this
point should not affect our main result, and authors consider that not only medial gastrocnemius but also
ateral gastrocnemius and soleus were elongated similarly between TRAN and ECC conditions
explanation has added in the manuscript as a limitation of this study. (Page 20, Line 331-337)

Minor comments
Comment 3]
ntro: Line 84 – should be changed to - “…the following concept…”
Response]
Thank you for your suggestion. We added “the” before “following concept…”. (Page 6, Line 83)
Comment 4]
Methods: Line 160 – change “inserting” to “onset of”
Response]
According to your suggestion, we changed the words. (Page 10, Line 158)
Comment 5]
Results: It would be helpful to have time-series plots of fascicle length change in all three conditions
similar to the torque plots.
My preference would be for time series plots to be group means with shaded standard deviations
Response]
We have added the data of the fascicle length changes as Figure 2 and Figure 4.
Discussion: Line 222 – change TRAS to TRAN
Response]
We are sorry for our mistake. We revised it. (Page 15, Line 235)
Comment 7]
Discussion: Line 349 - change “should be disappeared” to “should have disappeared”
Response]
Thank you for your suggestion. We changed the expression as you suggested. (Page 16, Line 262-263)

Responses to reviewer #2
Again, we appreciate your review. We are glad that our responses seem to be appropriate with respect
o your comments/suggestions. We have added the new Figure about fascicle length considering your
following comments. (Figure 4)
[Comment 1]
I am satisfied that the author's responses adequately address my original concerns. It seems reasonable
hat, for such small increments in torque, any additional tendon elongation would be small (~1 mm)
and potentially not detectable by subtraction of fascicle length from MTU length. I am pleased to see
he inclusion of fascicle length data plots in the results.
