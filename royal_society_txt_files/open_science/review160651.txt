This manuscript presents an important development of a next-gen approach to screening a large
number of microsatellites, together with the utilisation of such an approach in a non-model fish
to elucidate its population structure to answer an important management question. Alone either
of these two main research issues are significant, and together make for an important paper of
interest to many. As such the paper is well suited for publication.
The paper is very well written and the various parts well described in a logical flow. The
statistical analysis and the approaches used are robust, and the findings well interpreted. There
are few additions/changes to be made apart from some minor ones as indicated.
Paragraph beginning Line 84
As later a temporal analysis is made it would be useful as background information to add to this
paragraph something about the generation time of the boarfish.

analyses (ESM Table 4)”
Line 447
“The point of diminishing return, with and without putatively outlier loci included, for
increasing number of loci equated to approximately 30 loci,…”
As this is likely to be directly related to the number of alleles rather than loci it might be
interesting to plot allele number/Fst rather than Loci number. This might also then allow some
comparison to be made with likely numbers of SNPs that might give comparable power.

Is this correct? It seems the bold ones are the non-sig ones?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors have conducted a large-scale population genetic study of boarfish with samples
distributed widely across the species range in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.
Population genetic data has been generated in a two-step approach, utilizing high-throughput
sequencing to first isolate microsatellite markers and then to resequence a selection of these
markers across a set of nearly 1000 samples. The study represents an impressive amount of work
and has the potential to offer useful insights into new approaches for molecular ecological
investigation and into the population structure of the target species. However there are a number
of drawbacks with the current manuscript that I feel prevent publication in its current form.
Major issues:
The paper presents a novel method for microsatellite genotyping and then continues to apply the
data to generate a ‘robust’ picture of population structure, culminating in a recommendation for
how to manage the newly found stocks of boarfish. While the volume of data is impressive, the
authors appear to be going from A to Z without spending much time considering many of the
assumptions in between, leading to a strong impression that the conclusions are not supported by
the data.
For example, it is normal for novel methods to undergo a level of validation against an
established standard. In this case a short comparative study between microsatellite genotyping
via GBS and via traditional CE for a subset of markers would seem to be an essential pre-requisite
prior to any application of microsatellite GBS data to population genetic analysis. Are the results
concordant, are all alleles recovered, is the GBS approach repeatable? Within the GBS analysis,
were control samples used throughout the library preparation process (among plates)? I would
like to see a lot more empirical evaluation of the GBS microsatellite data prior to application to a
molecular ecological study.
The authors start with the premise that microsatellite markers are selectively neutral and then go
on to refer to many of the markers as being under directional or balancing selection. The
language is rather sloppy on this issue throughout. The finding that 20% of markers are ‘outliers’
seems suspiciously high and may raise questions over the accuracy of the genotype data,
however the authors take these results at face value and move immediately to a biological
interpretation.
4
This practice is continued throughout the population genetic analysis, giving the impression that
the multiple analyses have been implemented following something of a black box approach,
without a deeper understanding of how the different packages work or what they can be used to
infer. It is critical that population genetic software is applied with knowledge of underlying
population genetic theory and that the results are critically evaluated to check that they make
sense. For example, the genetic similarity between the ALM and NEA ‘populations’ indicated by
Fst and Migrate data is a peculiar result given their respective locations and the number of
localities between them that show more distant genetic relationships. Is the result genuine? Are
there any explanations for this finding (either biogeographical or methodological)?
It is not clear how many different stocks are being proposed based on the total data set, or the
results of the different analyses, but I am slightly alarmed by the certainty with which the authors
make conclusions from their data and move immediately to management recommendations. I
would see this manuscript as an initial investigation into the population structure of boarfish,
particularly in light of the fact that the technique itself is novel and in my opinion not yet
sufficiently demonstrated. The authors should understand that the uptake of such
recommendations has serious implications for fisheries management and that the managers
making these decisions will not be able to critically evaluate the population genetic data for
themselves. It is therefore a significant responsibility to make genetic management
recommendations; I do not feel that the current study provides a sufficiently robust set of data to
do this.
The quality of English is fairly high throughout, however the paper has been written in a very
confident style with little room for consideration of possible limitations, drawbacks or alternative
explanations. This can make for quite a frustrating read when there are clearly areas where the
study is lacking or the authors are making claims not entirely supported by the data. A more
circumspect style would be worth considering.
The authors claim repeatedly that the method is quicker and cheaper than CE microsatellite
genotyping however no costs or timescales are provided for the work. This is a potentially very
interesting and useful area to assess, but claims cannot be made in the absence of data. A
comparison of estimated costs and timescales for genotyping 40 microsats for 960 fish using the
two approaches (after the msat discovery phase) would be welcome.
Minor corrections:
Line 38 How are the authors defining population genomics here? Are 40 microsatellites really a
population genomic tool?
Line 40 Not all microsatellites are selectively neutral – reword
Line 45 Repetition of ‘laborious’ – remove
Lines 47-50 I understand the direction of the argument here but the authors are over-
simplifying somewhat – microsatellites are also subject to ascertainment bias, but are probably
less sensitive to it, and microsatellites don’t necessarily have higher allelic richness in all cases.
Please rephrase with less absolute language.
Line 57 ‘per unit effort’
Line 71 What do the authors mean by ‘better’ data?

Line 74 What does ‘de novo’ mean in the context of a marker panel? And again at line 81, and
110,
Line 84 Scientific name required
Line 102 It is…
Line 111 ‘Species range’ or ‘distribution of the species’, not ‘distribution range’. And see Line 119.
Line 117 How many fish, at how many locations? What years? A map would be useful here.
Line 133 Why were they considered free of parasites?
Line 167 How many primer pairs were used in total?
Line 187 The final extension step is normally at the same temperature as the cycling extension
step (72 degrees C). Any reason that 60 degrees was used here?
Line 228 Was there a minimum number of reads per allele?
Line 302 Move this section to methods.
Line 313 Almost 40% of reads contained microsatellites. This seems quite high.
Line 317 Should this be ‘read depth per allele’? Otherwise it seems to contradict the first half of
the sentence.
Line 330 80% read redundancy seems very high. Any explanation why so many PCR products
failed to sequence as expected?
Line 353 Please give a brief explanation of gametic phase disequilibrium
Line 359 20% of loci were potential outliers - seems high.
Line 376 ‘significant population differentiation’
Line 390- It’s hard to see 3 and 5 clusters respectively in the structure plots. Looks like
fewer clusters to me – 2 (orange/not orange) and 3 (light blue, orange and yellow), respectively?
Table 4 I’m confused by the Table description. Presumably its pairwise Fst in the upper diagonal
and p-value in the lower diagonal? So in fact all values are significant other than those in bold??
Either way the Table doesn’t match the text at Line 421. Same goes for ESM Table 7.
Line 425 Typo with Fst = 0.4610??
Line 436 How can this be explained given the relative geographic position of the sampling
localities? The relative positions of the ALM, NEA and MED samples seems odd.
Line 444 Is the term ‘high grading’ being used as an equivalent to ‘outlier’ here?
Line 465 No costs are provided, no timescales are provided, this sentence is not supported.
6
Line 468 I am not convinced that boarfish ‘stocks’ have been robustly delineated based on this
data. Are the authors suggesting 8 different stocks? The Structure results don’t show this.
Line 522 The use of the word ‘validation’ is not appropriate here. The approach would benefit
from validation, for example by comparing the genotype data from GBS with traditional
genotyping via CE.
Line 530 It is not possible to say that the method is easily transferable if it has only been used on
one platform.
Line 579 Not supported by the data.

Authors have revised the manuscript comprehensively. While they have put forward a robust
defense against certain points that I raised, they have nonetheless addressed my key concerns
regarding the eventual strength of their conclusions relating to fish stock management, and they
have provided reassurance on the issue of method development, validation and controls.
On the whole, I am much happier with this draft of the ms and would like to see it published,
however I am yet to be convinced that the conclusions are supported by the data when it comes
to the number of populations that exist within the dataset.
The authors have revised the number of populations they have found down from 8 to 7 and near
the start of the discussion (Line 494) refer to Table 4 for support. However Table 4 is still a matrix
of 8 putative populations and it is not clear which of these is now thought not to exist. Similarly,
the divMIGRATE analysis is based on 8 populations rather than 7. The discussion hints at the
NEA and NSA-PT1 samples possibly being too close to separate, but I don’t think that this is
actually concluded. It would be useful to know which 7 populations are now being proposed.
The authors state in their response that “…we have assimilated [structure data] with the other
analyses performed and also with our biological knowledge of the species and come to the
supported conclusion that there are 7 populations”. This may well be the case, but I cannot see
the argument (or support) for this conclusion in the results or discussion. I would encourage the
authors to put forward this interpretation of their data more clearly.
On a related note, although the authors’ defence of my comments regarding the STRUCTURE
interpretation is understood, I still feel that the reader will struggle to reach the same conclusion
as the authors regarding the number of clusters resulting from STRUCTURE analysis,
particularly on splitting the AZA and PTS samples at k=5. It is difficult for me to accept the
14
authors’ statement in their response that, ‘This is again supported by the data and not just the
visual interpretation of the figure’, when in fact in the text it states ‘data not shown’ (Line 412).
The reader therefore only has a visual interpretation to go on. Perhaps the point is moot anyway,
as there are now seven populations, but a supplementary presentation of this data may be a good
idea (if this is already included, apologies, but I cannot view the supplemental data online for
some reason and there is no description of what it contains in the paper).
Lastly, on the suggestion that my criticism of the style is unfair, I should say that my intention
with this review was to help improve the quality of the manuscript and the style of language
used can sometimes be an important component in this respect. Given the substantial changes
made between the original version and the current revision, both in terms of the conclusions
regarding population genetic structure and the applications of this information to stock
management, I feel that my suggestion of employing a more circumspect style may have been
warranted. Nevertheless, I do like this paper and want to assure the authors of my best
intentions with regard to providing hopefully constructive criticism.

Your revision has been well-received by the reviewers but referee 2 wants you to return to the
justification of number of populations in your data. Can you have look at their comments and
consider final adjustments based on their recommendation. Provided you can address these
comments I think the paper should be able to go through without further review.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
authors have revised the manuscript comprehensively. While they have put forward a robust
defense against certain points that I raised, they have nonetheless addressed my key concerns
regarding the eventual strength of their conclusions relating to fish stock management, and they
have provided reassurance on the issue of method development, validation and controls.
On the whole, I am much happier with this draft of the ms and would like to see it published,
however I am yet to be convinced that the conclusions are supported by the data when it comes
to the number of populations that exist within the dataset.
The authors have revised the number of populations they have found down from 8 to 7 and near
the start of the discussion (Line 494) refer to Table 4 for support. However Table 4 is still a matrix
of 8 putative populations and it is not clear which of these is now thought not to exist. Similarly,
the divMIGRATE analysis is based on 8 populations rather than 7. The discussion hints at the
NEA and NSA-PT1 samples possibly being too close to separate, but I don’t think that this is
actually concluded. It would be useful to know which 7 populations are now being proposed.
The authors state in their response that “…we have assimilated [structure data] with the other
analyses performed and also with our biological knowledge of the species and come to the
supported conclusion that there are 7 populations”. This may well be the case, but I cannot see
the argument (or support) for this conclusion in the results or discussion. I would encourage the
authors to put forward this interpretation of their data more clearly.
On a related note, although the authors’ defence of my comments regarding the STRUCTURE
interpretation is understood, I still feel that the reader will struggle to reach the same conclusion
as the authors regarding the number of clusters resulting from STRUCTURE analysis,
particularly on splitting the AZA and PTS samples at k=5. It is difficult for me to accept the
authors’ statement in their response that, ‘This is again supported by the data and not just the
visual interpretation of the figure’, when in fact in the text it states ‘data not shown’ (Line 412).
The reader therefore only has a visual interpretation to go on. Perhaps the point is moot anyway,
as there are now seven populations, but a supplementary presentation of this data may be a good
idea (if this is already included, apologies, but I cannot view the supplemental data online for
some reason and there is no description of what it contains in the paper).
Lastly, on the suggestion that my criticism of the style is unfair, I should say that my intention
with this review was to help improve the quality of the manuscript and the style of language
used can sometimes be an important component in this respect. Given the substantial changes
made between the original version and the current revision, both in terms of the conclusions
regarding population genetic structure and the applications of this information to stock
management, I feel that my suggestion of employing a more circumspect style may have been
warranted. Nevertheless, I do like this paper and want to assure the authors of my best
intentions with regard to providing hopefully constructive criticism.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript presents an important development of a next-gen approach to screening a large
number of microsatellites, together with the utilisation of such an approach in a non-model fish to
elucidate its population structure to answer an important management question. Alone either of
these two main research issues are significant, and together make for an important paper of interest
to many. As such the paper is well suited for publication.
The paper is very well written and the various parts well described in a logical flow. The statistical
analysis and the approaches used are robust, and the findings well interpreted. There are few
additions/changes to be made apart from some minor ones as indicated.
Thank you very much for the positive comments. We have addressed the minor comments below.
Paragraph beginning Line 84
As later a temporal analysis is made it would be useful as background information to add to this
paragraph something about the generation time of the boarfish.
We agree and have added the following sentence ‘Boarfish in the northeast Atlantic area are a long-
lived species that reach a maximum age of >30 years with a length- and age-at-maturity of 9.7 cm
TL and 3.4 years, respectively (Farrell et al. 2012; Hüssy et al, 2012).’
Line 102/3
“reported recent increases in abundance…” please add reference for this reported increase
We have added the references from lines 87-90 ‘[24-26]’
Line 341
“Individuals genotyped at <75% of genotyped loci were not included in further analyses (ESM Table
4)”
Change to “In total 121Individuals were genotyped at <75% of loci and were not included in further
analyses (ESM Table 4)”
We have changed this as suggested.
Line 447
“The point of diminishing return, with and without putatively outlier loci included, for increasing
number of loci equated to approximately 30 loci,…”
As this is likely to be directly related to the number of alleles rather than loci it might be interesting to
plot allele number/Fst rather than Loci number. This might also then allow some comparison to be
made with likely numbers of SNPs that might give comparable power.
Whilst this is an interesting point we believe the exercise would be rather complicated as FST values
are not necessarily only related to number of alleles but also to frequencies within individual
populations. For instance if population A is fixed for one allele while population B is fixed for an
alternative allele then the resulting FST will be high, however the number of alleles will be low. In
addition increasing number of alleles usually increases heterozygosity which can reduce F ST (cf Jost,
2008), while the statistical power might increase with increasing number of alleles. Hence any
results would be confounded. Therefore we would suggest not to include this analysis.
Line 823 Table 4
“Values in bold were significant after Bonferroni correction”
Is this correct? It seems the bold ones are the non-sig ones?
Also I assume the values above the diagonal are the Fst and below the p values. Please add this to
Table legend.
Thank you for noticing this discrepancy. This was a simple error on our part. The values indicated in
bold were significant before and after sequential Bonferroni correction for multiple tests.
The legend has been corrected accordingly.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have conducted a large-scale population genetic study of boarfish with samples
distributed widely across the species range in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Population
genetic data has been generated in a two-step approach, utilizing high-throughput sequencing to first
isolate microsatellite markers and then to resequence a selection of these markers across a set of
nearly 1000 samples. The study represents an impressive amount of work and has the potential to
offer useful insights into new approaches for molecular ecological investigation and into the
population structure of the target species. However there are a number of drawbacks with the current
manuscript that I feel prevent publication in its current form.
Major issues:
The paper presents a novel method for microsatellite genotyping and then continues to apply the data
to generate a ‘robust’ picture of population structure, culminating in a recommendation for how to
manage the newly found stocks of boarfish. While the volume of data is impressive, the authors
appear to be going from A to Z without spending much time considering many of the assumptions in
between, leading to a strong impression that the conclusions are not supported by the data.
We contest this point and are confident that our data are robust and the assertions that are made
in the manuscript are well founded and well supported. We have presented the methods and data
in a simple and logical manner so that they are understandable and easy to follow in a step wise
progression even by a non-expert (as noted and complemented by reviewer 1). This is an important
consideration given the applied nature of the study. We understand that this may appear to be a
quick A to Z guide but we can assure the reviewer that careful consideration was given to each and
every step. We have explained this below and addressed the concerns of the reviewer.
For example, it is normal for novel methods to undergo a level of validation against an established
standard. In this case a short comparative study between microsatellite genotyping via GBS and via
traditional CE for a subset of markers would seem to be an essential pre-requisite prior to any
application of microsatellite GBS data to population genetic analysis. Are the results concordant, are
all alleles recovered, is the GBS approach repeatable? Within the GBS analysis, were control samples
used throughout the library preparation process (among plates)? I would like to see a lot more
empirical evaluation of the GBS microsatellite data prior to application to a molecular ecological study.
This is a very good point and something we have been working very hard to achieve in a systematic
way over the past few years. The manuscript presents a method which has been under development
for a number of years in our research group. Each step of the development has been rigorously
tested, employed, reviewed and published along the way. The version of the methods presented in
the current manuscript for both marker discovery and microsatellite GBS are modified and
improved versions of those in Carlsson et al 2003 (Journal of Fish Biology, 82, 944–958) and of Vartia
et al 2014 (Hereditas. 151, 43-54) and Vartia et al 2016 (R. Soc. Open Sci. 3, 150565). They are also
being further developed and employed in a number of other marine fish species and deep sea
species in ongoing projects within our research group. Other research groups are also working on
microsatellite GBS as evidenced by three recent publications Darby et al 2016 (Ecol. Evol. 6, 4502–
4512), Zhan et al (Mol Ecol doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12561) and Suez et al 2016 (Mol. Ecol. Res. 16,
524–33).
Vartia et al 2016 (Published in Royal Society Open Science) validated the GBS of microsatellites
approach against microsatellite data generated by traditional capillary electrophoresis. Though that
study used the 454 sequencing platform and the current manuscript used the MiSeq we feel that
this validation study is robust and it is the basis of the current manuscript. Darby et al also
performed a comparative study using both GBS on an Illumina MiSeq and traditional capillary
electrophoresis on a subset of loci which indicated that ‘fragment analysis by sequencing not only
detects a greater number of alleles than by capillary electrophoresis but that this also appears to
resolve a greater degree of population genetic structure and may reduce overall costs of projects
with a large number of samples’. We have clarified this in the introduction text.
Therefore we believe it is not necessary to perform a capillary electrophoresis comparison for each
subsequent study GBS is used in, especially if that study is on a species with no existing capillary
electrophoresis generated data. If there are existing data then some form of calibration may be
possible to compare new GBS data with existing data. However as stated in Vartia et al 2016 ‘It is
unlikely that complete agreement between these two approaches is achievable, owing to inherent
errors in capillary electrophoresis, genotype calls and GBS platform-specific sequencing errors.’
Therefore the benefit of comparing the genotyping of de novo developed boarfish microsatellites
by GBS and capillary electrophoresis is limited. Further, unlike capillary electrophoresis, the GBS
method provides access to the underlying sequence data so many of the inherent technical issues
associated with capillary electrophoresis and the lack of reproducibility within and between labs
can be avoided.
In our specific case the MICROCHECKER analyses (line 365) ‘indicated that genotyping was not
affected by technical artefacts, errors or large allele dropouts…’ further supporting the capability of
recovering also large alleles. Further the same individuals used for microsatellite discovery through
shotgun sequencing were included in the amplicon sequencing effort which has now been clarified
in the text. These two control individuals confirmed that all alleles present in the shotgun
sequencing effort were also detected in the amplicon sequencing effort. Additional alleles were
detected among the sequenced amplicons which is likely due to the lower read depth of the shotgun
effort. Hence the repeatability of the approach has been verified. This has now been highlighted in
the manuscript.
The authors start with the premise that microsatellite markers are selectively neutral and then go on
to refer to many of the markers as being under directional or balancing selection. The language is
rather sloppy on this issue throughout. The finding that 20% of markers are ‘outliers’ seems
suspiciously high and may raise questions over the accuracy of the genotype data, however the
authors take these results at face value and move immediately to a biological interpretation.
We believe that there is some confusion regarding line 40 of the introduction which states
‘Selectively neutral microsatellites have been the workhorses of population genetics for the past
two decades and have played an important role in identifying population structure in numerous
species’. We are aware that not all microsatellites are selectively neutral however neutral
microsatellites were the focus of most of the microsatellite based population genetics research for
the past two decades which is what is stated in the introduction. It is only more recently that there
has been a move towards identifying microsatellites under diversifying selection. We have clarified
this with a follow up sentence ‘Though markers under selection are increasingly being included in
population genetic studies due to their sometimes higher power to detect contemporary population
structure including microsatellites (Mariani & Bekkevold).’
The fact that we found that some of the markers in the study were potentially showing footprints
of selection is an interesting observation that was further investigated in detail. This finding was not
merely taken at face value. Subsequent analyses were performed with two datasets one with 40
loci (including potential outliers) and one with 32 loci (without potential outliers). The potential
effect of the inclusion of markers showing footprints of selection was assessed on a global and
pairwise scale. Further, (lines 483-489) pairwise analyses with LOSITAN indicated that only 3 loci
were potential outliers in multiple pairwise tests.
It is difficult to draw comparison with previous microsatellite based population genetic studies in
marine fish as most do not have a large number of microsatellites and very few conduct further
analyses of outlier loci as we have in the current study.
This practice is continued throughout the population genetic analysis, giving the impression that the
multiple analyses have been implemented following something of a black box approach, without a
deeper understanding of how the different packages work or what they can be used to infer. It is
critical that population genetic software is applied with knowledge of underlying population genetic
theory and that the results are critically evaluated to check that they make sense. For example, the
genetic similarity between the ALM and NEA ‘populations’ indicated by Fst and Migrate data is a
peculiar result given their respective locations and the number of localities between them that show
more distant genetic relationships. Is the result genuine? Are there any explanations for this finding
(either biogeographical or methodological)?
We disagree with this comment about a black box approach. We have been clear and open in how
we have analysed and presented our data. We have deliberately avoided ‘black box’ packages such
as Migrate (we used divMigrate which is a different, R based, package) and have presented simple
statistics to support the data as acknowledged by reviewer 1 ‘The statistical analysis and the
approaches used are robust, and the findings well interpreted’. Yes a number of different software
packages have been used but each for a specified purpose and the results do not hang on any
particular package all of which have known issues. Hence we have assimilated the results/outputs
from a multiple statistical approaches to reach the most parsimonious scientific conclusion.
Yes we agree that the genetic similarity between ALM and NEA is interesting from an academic
perspective and is possibly due some historical biogeographical effect. However there is no
empirical evidence yet for this and as such we refrain from speculation in the manuscript. In the
context of identifying population units to inform assessment and consequently management it is
not as relevant as the other observations. The inclusion of the ALM sample despite the peculiar
result highlights the transparency in the way in which the results in the current manuscript are
presented which allows readers to interpret the result themselves also. However this observation
certainly warrants further investigation in a further complementary study.
We have clarified this in the text (lines 502-505) ‘Interestingly the Alboran Sea sample appeared to
show closer affinity with the NEA and NSA-PTN1 samples than with the geographically closer PTS
samples. It is unclear what the cause this affinity is but should be further investigated.’
It is not clear how many different stocks are being proposed based on the total data set, or the results
of the different analyses, but I am slightly alarmed by the certainty with which the authors make
conclusions from their data and move immediately to management recommendations. I would see
this manuscript as an initial investigation into the population structure of boarfish, particularly in light
of the fact that the technique itself is novel and in my opinion not yet sufficiently demonstrated. The
authors should understand that the uptake of such recommendations has serious implications for
fisheries management and that the managers making these decisions will not be able to critically
evaluate the population genetic data for themselves. It is therefore a significant responsibility to make
genetic management recommendations; I do not feel that the current study provides a sufficiently
robust set of data to do this.
We understand the concerns of the reviewer and are well aware of the implications for fisheries
assessment and management. Therefore we have clarified this in the manuscript and reworded this
section of the discussion lines 484-519. We have removed references to stocks as this is a
management term and as identified it is not up to this study to define these. We have instead
reported only the identified population structure and suggested that it may be used to inform
scientists on the appropriate level on which to base assessment and management.
The quality of English is fairly high throughout, however the paper has been written in a very confident
style with little room for consideration of possible limitations, drawbacks or alternative
explanations. This can make for quite a frustrating read when there are clearly areas where the study
is lacking or the authors are making claims not entirely supported by the data. A more circumspect
style would be worth considering.
We believe this is an unfair criticism to have as a major issue and is in stark contrast to the comment
of reviewer 1 ‘The paper is very well written and the various parts well described in a logical flow.’
We have taken great care with the wording of the manuscript in order to make it comprehensible
to a wide audience and not just to highly specialised geneticists. Where possible we have avoided
technical jargon and have clearly stated our aims, described in fine detail the methods and the
unambiguous results. We have also highlighted the weaknesses in the discussion section and made
suggestions for improvements to the approach.
The authors claim repeatedly that the method is quicker and cheaper than CE microsatellite
genotyping however no costs or timescales are provided for the work. This is a potentially very
interesting and useful area to assess, but claims cannot be made in the absence of data. A comparison
of estimated costs and timescales for genotyping 40 microsats for 960 fish using the two approaches
(after the msat discovery phase) would be welcome.
Stated first by Vartia et al 2016 and later corroborated independently and empirically by Darby et
al 2016 the GBS approach to microsatellite genotyping is quicker and cheaper than CE genotyping
when conducted on a large scale. We have now cited Darby et al earlier in the manuscript to clarify
this. We do not believe an additional cost benefit analyses in the current manuscript would be a
relevant exercise. Further the costs of labour, consumables and sequencing are highly variable
between countries and institutes and are also highly dependent on the availability of equipment etc
so any cost comparisons are of limited general value anyway.
Minor corrections:
Line 38 How are the authors defining population genomics here? Are 40 microsatellites really a
population genomic tool?
We are not referring to the final panel of 40 microsatellites in our study in this sentence in the
introduction and we do not think or state that 40 microsatellites should be considered a population
genomic tool. As we believe is quite clear from the sentence we are referring to population
genomics and the use of SNPS. ‘Population genetics and genomics rely primarily on two types of
genetic markers; microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or short tandem
repeats (STRs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).’
Line 40 Not all microsatellites are selectively neutral – reword
Please see the explanation above in the major issues section.
Line 45 Repetition of ‘laborious’ – remove
We have changed the word ‘laborious’ in line 43 to ‘time-consuming’ to avoid this instance of
repetition.
Lines 47-50 I understand the direction of the argument here but the authors are over-simplifying
somewhat – microsatellites are also subject to ascertainment bias, but are probably less sensitive to
it, and microsatellites don’t necessarily have higher allelic richness in all cases. Please rephrase with
less absolute language.
We agree that we have presented a simple and concise review of the pros and cons of microsatellites
and SNPs. It is not a thorough review and is purely an introduction to why microsatellites should
not be overlooked as a useful population genetics tool. We have cited a number of studies and
reviews which deal with the topic in detail. We have moderated the language to reflect this.
Line 57 ‘per unit effort’
Changed to ‘per sequencing effort’
Line 71 What do the authors mean by ‘better’ data?
The citation for this statement about better data is provided …‘Vartia et al 2016’
To clarify, by better data we are referring to having access to the actual sequence rather than a trace
of the fragment length. This provides more information and is a better form of data.
Line 74 What does ‘de novo’ mean in the context of a marker panel? And again at line 81, and 110,
De novo as defined means starting from the beginning. So de novo development of microsatellites
and marker panels means developing them from scratch and not simply redesigning primers from
existing microsatellites to fit the sequencing platform.
Line 84 Scientific name required
This is supplied in previous line with the authority and we want to avoid unnecessary repetition. So
we would argue against repeating it here.
Line 102 It is…
We have deleted the word ‘However’
Line 111 ‘Species range’ or ‘distribution of the species’, not ‘distribution range’. And see Line 119.
Changed to “species’ range”
Line 117 How many fish, at how many locations? What years? A map would be useful here.
The details of the samples are included in the results and in Figure 1 and ESM Table 1. Line 117 is
the method of collection and processing.
Line 133 Why were they considered free of parasites?
There were no visible parasites in the muscle tissue. We did not use gill tissue for this step as there
was a higher probability of ecto-parasites being present and they are more difficult to see on the
gill tissue.
Line 167 How many primer pairs were used in total?
This in the results section in line 325.
Line 187 The final extension step is normally at the same temperature as the cycling extension
step (72 degrees C). Any reason that 60 degrees was used here?
It was specified in the multiplex PCR kit manufacturers (Qiagen) protocol. It specifically states to use
60C for microsatellite multiplex. This temperature promotes the adenylation of amplicons
(additions of A overhang) which in our case was not strictly speaking necessary. However this
temperature proved successful in test runs which were analysed for amplification success on
agarose gel.
Line 228 Was there a minimum number of reads per allele?
The minimum was for the number of reads per locus and individual. The genotyping was performed
based in the read length histogram which is similar to the method used for scoring microsatellites
from capillary electrophoresis.
Line 302 Move this section to methods.
We disagree with this suggestion. These are the results of the sampling which is described in
methods section. They are appropriate where they are.
Line 313 Almost 40% of reads contained microsatellites. This seems quite high.
Almost 40% of the reads which were paired contained microsatellites but only 15% of the total
recovered reads contained microsatellites. This is well within the range seen in other species (one
per 260 bp in cod [Carlsson et al 2013], one per 6·56 kbp in three-spined stickleback, to one per 32
bp of the spotted green pufferfish [Chistiakova et al., 2005]) therefore this was not a notable finding.
Line 317 Should this be ‘read depth per allele’? Otherwise it seems to contradict the first half of
the sentence.
No this is just read depth per locus. The contigs in tablet contained many assembled reads not all of
which contained the microsatellite. Therefore the contigs comprised 10-79 reads and the section
with the locus had a read depth of 2 to 40 reads. We have added ‘per locus’ to the text to clarify
this.
Line 330 80% read redundancy seems very high. Any explanation why so many PCR products failed
to sequence as expected?
It is quite high and we discuss the potential reasons for this in Line 555 and make recommendations
on how to improve the yield.
Line 353 Please give a brief explanation of gametic phase disequilibrium
In the text we state ‘It is likely that the loci were affected by gametic phase disequilibrium and not
actually physically linked…’ meaning ‘linkage disequilibrium may exist between alleles at different
loci without any genetic linkage between them and independently of whether or not allele
frequencies are in equilibrium’.
Line 359 20% of loci were potential outliers - seems high.
Please see explanation in major issues above.
Line 376 ‘significant population differentiation’
We have changed ‘structure’ to differentiation
Line 390- It’s hard to see 3 and 5 clusters respectively in the structure plots. Looks like fewer
clusters to me – 2 (orange/not orange) and 3 (light blue, orange and yellow), respectively?
We disagree. In Figure 2a there are 3 clusters which are supported by the delta K method AZA, PTS1
and PTS2 form one cluster. MTA and TKM for another and the remaining samples for the third. The
difference in Figure 2b is that the MOR samples form a separate cluster and the AZA and PTS samples
are split into two clusters. This is again supported by the data and not just the visual interpretation
of the figure.
Table 4 I’m confused by the Table description. Presumably its pairwise Fst in the upper diagonal and
p-value in the lower diagonal? So in fact all values are significant other than those in bold?? Either
way the Table doesn’t match the text at Line 421. Same goes for ESM Table 7.
Thank you for pointing this out. This has been corrected as explained in response to reviewer 1.
Similarly ESM table 7 has also been corrected
Line 425 Typo with Fst = 0.4610??
That is a typo and has been corrected
Line 436 How can this be explained given the relative geographic position of the sampling
localities? The relative positions of the ALM, NEA and MED samples seems odd.
We assume you mean the ALM, NEA and MOR samples? We have explained this in the major issues
section above. We agree that given the geographic positions of the samples it is unusual that they
appear more closely related than to the AZA and PTS samples in between. One explanation may be
historical biogeography and distribution. The ALM, NEA and MOR samples may have an ‘Atlantic
shelf’ common ancestry whilst the AZA and PTS may have a common insular ancestry.
Line 444 Is the term ‘high grading’ being used as an equivalent to ‘outlier’ here?
No it is not. We use the term high-grading as it better describes selecting the most informative loci
which may be used to differentiate two populations.
Line 465 No costs are provided, no timescales are provided, this sentence is not supported.
Please the explanation in the major issues section and Darby et al 2016.
Line 468 I am not convinced that boarfish ‘stocks’ have been robustly delineated based on this
data. Are the authors suggesting 8 different stocks? The Structure results don’t show this.
No it is 7 populations as clarified now in the discussion and we have removed the suggestions as to
how these should separated into stocks as this is a decision for managers as noted above. Regarding
the STRUCTURE results no they do not indicate a K of 7 however as noted by the STRUCTURE authors
in the software manual, STRUCTURE ‘merely provides an ad hoc approximation and the biological
interpretation of K may not be straightforward’. See full extract from Manual below. Therefore we
have not merely accepted the K values from STRUCTURE on face value. Instead we have assimilated
them with the other analyses performed and also with our biological knowledge of the species and
come to the supported conclusion that there are 7 populations.
‘5 Estimation of K (the number of populations)
In our paper describing this program, we pointed out that this issue should be treated with care for
two reasons: (1) it is computationally difficult to obtain accurate estimates of Pr(X|K), and our
method merely provides an ad hoc approximation, and (2) the biological interpretation of K may
not be straightforward. In our experience we find that the real difficulty lies with the second issue.
Our procedure for estimating K generally works well in data sets with a small number of discrete
populations. However, many real-world data sets do not conform precisely to the structure model (e.g.,
due to isolation by distance or inbreeding). In those cases there may not be a natural answer to what
is the “correct” value of K. Perhaps for this kind of reason, it is not infrequent that in real data the value
of our model choice criterion continues to increase with increasing K. Then it usually makes sense to
focus on values of K that capture most of the structure in the data and that seem biologically sensible.’
Line 522 The use of the word ‘validation’ is not appropriate here. The approach would benefit
from validation, for example by comparing the genotype data from GBS with traditional genotyping
via CE.
We agree that validation is not the correct term to use here. As described in detail above the
approach was validated in Vartia et al. and implemented in the current study. ‘validating’ have been
changed to ‘implementing’.
Line 530 It is not possible to say that the method is easily transferable if it has only been used on
one platform.
We disagree. The method has also been used on the 454 platform, albeit with a smaller number of
samples and markers. The method uses universal tails to anneal simple barcodes which are not
platform specific. Therefore the barcoded amplicons can be sequenced on any sequencing platform
(following standard library preparation) which can deliver sufficient read length. This stipulation has
been added to clarify. Other methods which use Illumina specific adapters can only be sequenced
on Illumina platforms. They would need to redesign the barcodes/adapters to switch to for example
an Ion Torrent. Our method does not have this limitation.
Line 579 Not supported by the data.
The basis for this statement has been addressed above and the line in question has been supported
by the two relevant citations.

implementing a high-throughput approach to population genetics in boarfish (Capros aper)’
Dear Professor Padian and reviewers,
Thank very much for the rapid and thorough review of our revised manuscript and the positive
outcome. We are very grateful for the suggestions of the reviewers which improved the original
manuscript.
We have addressed the additional minor comments of reviewer 2 and detailed these below in bold.
We have also made changes to the manuscript using track changes.
We look forward to seeing the manuscript in print and hope that it makes a significant contribution to
the emerging field of microsatellite GBS.
Kind Regards,
Edward Farrell

Comments to the Author:
Your revision has been well-received by the reviewers but referee 2 wants you to return to the
justification of number of populations in your data. Can you have look at their comments and
consider final adjustments based on their recommendation. Provided you can address these
comments I think the paper should be able to go through without further review.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I am satisfied that the authors have addressed my original comments and am happy for publication
to commence once agreement has been reached on the issues raised by the other reviewer.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
authors have revised the manuscript comprehensively. While they have put forward a robust
defense against certain points that I raised, they have nonetheless addressed my key concerns
regarding the eventual strength of their conclusions relating to fish stock management, and they
have provided reassurance on the issue of method development, validation and controls. On the
whole, I am much happier with this draft of the ms and would like to see it published, however I am
yet to be convinced that the conclusions are supported by the data when it comes to the number of
populations that exist within the dataset.
The authors have revised the number of populations they have found down from 8 to 7 and near the
start of the discussion (Line 494) refer to Table 4 for support. However Table 4 is still a matrix of 8
putative populations and it is not clear which of these is now thought not to exist. Similarly, the
divMIGRATE analysis is based on 8 populations rather than 7.
We have made minor changes to the text to clarify this. It is now clearer that Table 4 presents data
for 8 clustered samples (line 434) and not 8 populations. This is also the case with the divMigrate
analysis. We do not present the idea of 7 populations until the discussion now and here we clearly
explain why one of the 8 samples is not considered to be a true population unit but rather a small
sample collected in a mixing zone (line 502-504).
The discussion hints at the NEA and NSA-PT1 samples possibly being too close to separate, but I
don’t think that this is actually concluded. It would be useful to know which 7 populations are now
being proposed.
The level of differentiation between these is clarified in lines line 510-513. This information can be
used by stock assessment scientists to decide if they think they should define these as two stocks
or a single stock comprising two population components. On the reviewer’s recommendation we
have refrained from making a suggestion in the manuscript on which option we believe to be
appropriate but have provided the necessary data for others to make this call.
The 7 proposed populations are explained in detail in lines 491-519 and are also indicated in Figure
1. As explained above the PTN2A samples is not considered to represent a true population.
The authors state in their response that “…we have assimilated [structure data] with the other
analyses performed and also with our biological knowledge of the species and come to the
supported conclusion that there are 7 populations”. This may well be the case, but I cannot see the
argument (or support) for this conclusion in the results or discussion. I would encourage the authors
to put forward this interpretation of their data more clearly.
We believe that we have presented the data clearly in the results section (in particular lines 424-
435) and have shown all of the steps involved in analysing the data from the 20 samples dataset
through to the final determination of 7 population units. The confusion seems to arise mainly from
the STRUCTURE results but it is well known (as explained in the previous response to the
reviewers’ comments) that STRUCTURE results only provide and an ‘ad hoc approximation’ of K
estimation and ‘the biological interpretation of K may not be straightforward’. Ideally we would
not have presented the STRUCTURE results as they do not contribute significantly to the overall
results and are primarily useful as a visual representation of the clustering of samples. However
this would likely have been a significant issue with reviewers as STRUCTURE remains the most
common approach for estimating K in population genetics. We do not want the discussion to
become a debate on the use and misuse of STRUCTURE however we have added a sentence to
resolve any confusion Line 492-496.
On a related note, although the authors’ defence of my comments regarding the STRUCTURE
interpretation is understood, I still feel that the reader will struggle to reach the same conclusion as
the authors regarding the number of clusters resulting from STRUCTURE analysis, particularly on
splitting the AZA and PTS samples at k=5. It is difficult for me to accept the authors’ statement in
their response that, ‘This is again supported by the data and not just the visual interpretation of the
figure’, when in fact in the text it states ‘data not shown’ (Line 412). The reader therefore only has a
visual interpretation to go on. Perhaps the point is moot anyway, as there are now seven
populations, but a supplementary presentation of this data may be a good idea (if this is already
included, apologies, but I cannot view the supplemental data online for some reason and there is no
description of what it contains in the paper).
We understand and appreciate the concerns of the reviewer on this issue. The misinterpretation
of and overreliance on STRUCTURE results is widespread in the literature. For clarity we have
added ESM Figure 1 which illustrates the Mean LnP(K).
Lastly, on the suggestion that my criticism of the style is unfair, I should say that my intention with
this review was to help improve the quality of the manuscript and the style of language used can
sometimes be an important component in this respect. Given the substantial changes made
between the original version and the current revision, both in terms of the conclusions regarding
population genetic structure and the applications of this information to stock management, I feel
that my suggestion of employing a more circumspect style may have been warranted. Nevertheless,
I do like this paper and want to assure the authors of my best intentions with regard to providing
hopefully constructive criticism.
Thank you for your comments and a very thorough review of the manuscript. We agree that the
manuscript has been improved and are grateful for the constructive comments which lead to this.
