The manuscript by Shanafelt et al. presents a very nice example for the current needs in different
disciplines to define appropriate surrogate network models for the purpose of modeling and
hypothesis testing. While the authors focus here on the special case of habitat graphs in ecology,
the framework developed by them is far more general and offers a wide range of possible
applications. During the revision of their manuscript, Shanafelt et al. have substantially improved
the presentation of their approach and achieved results. I am convinced that this work can now
become an important reference for future work across a variety of fields of research making use
of concepts from complex network theory. Therefore, I recommend this work for publication in
the Royal Society Open Science conditional on a few minor points to be addressed by the authors
in their final manuscript.
General comments:
1. The type of networks studied in the present work models connectivity relationships among
ecological habitats. In this regard, I am wondering about the specific mathematical structure
described in ll.93-99. If the main motivation would be species dispersal between spatially
disconnected patches, the corresponding ecological processes would be conveniently represented
by a flow, with A describing a stochastic matrix and a_{ij} being the probability of a randomly
selected individual to migrate from patch I to patch j within a given time unit. In that case, I
would normally expect a_{ii}>0 (in fact, eventually close to 1). Since the authors choose a
3
distinctively different setting with a_[ii}=0, I would in turn appreciate if they could add a few
words to clarify which specific ecological processes are modelled by their adjacency matrix.
2. Ll.102-103: While I generally agree with this statement, one could easily replace the
(unweighted) node degree by the (weighted) node strength to obtain an appropriate and
ecologically meaningful per-node network characteristic.
3. Pp.10-11: In the description of the network generation algorithm, I understand that the final
stochastic step is necessary to achieve an agreement between resulting network properties and
the user-defined criteria up to a certain tolerance. However, I don’t see that it guarantees
convergence to an optimal solution, but may also result in some local minimum of the
optimization function (1.5). I agree that this is a pragmatic approach, but would recommend a
few lines of discussion on convergence and optimality (also emphasizing on existence and
uniqueness of the dedicated solution for a given set of r*, v* and s*). I explicitly don’t request any
mathematical proof or additional results to be presented here, but would appreciate some general
remarks in this direction. The authors partially address this point in their conclusions (p.13,
ll.269-271). In a similar context, I would appreciate a short explanation of the reasons for the non-
convergence of the algorithm for very small v, as well as for jointly high values of v and s, as
shown in Fig. 2.
Technical comments:
• P.2, l.41: “criteria” => “criterion”
• P.5, ll.108-110: I am no native speaker, but would find the article “the” in front of the term
“spectral radius” more natural. Same on p.6, l.126 and on pp.6-7, ll.139-148 in relation with
“variance” and “skewness”.
• P.5, l.109: “there exist”(?)
• P.7, l.143: “of a wide…”
• P.7, l.160: “highlights”(?)
• P.8, ll.174-175: This sentence still reads a bit odd, what about: “We choose the entries of A_0 so
that they minimize the weighted sum of squared differences between the properties of our “new”
adjacency matrix and our user-defined criteria, resulting in the following minimization problem:”
• P.9, l.186: “form an”
• P.9, l.196: “given by an”
• Enumeration of equations: Why do you use (1.1) to (1.6) instead of just (1) to (6)?
• Tab. 1: Should the “Basal” algorithm just read “Bansal algorithm”?
• Fig. 1: Please explain briefly why you have a physical unit [km] for the spectral radius.
• Since the Supplementary Material is no Appendix included in the main body of the manuscript,
it should contain all references cited within (i.e., in SM A, citations of Salau et al. (2015) and Cao
(1998) should be given explicitly again).
• Suppl. Mat. A, Proposition 1: It seems to me that some of the steps are restricted to certain
specific properties of the networks studied in the main paper and do not hold in general (e.g., the
last inequality in eq. (S4)). Please carefully include all corresponding prerequisites in the
proposition.
• Suppl. Mat. B, Proposition 2: Do you have any reference for eq. (S6)? In addition, I would
suggest adding a brief explanation for the positivity in eq. (S7).
• Suppl. Mat. C: Why do you separate Figs. S2 and S3 instead of combining them into a single
three-panel figure?
• In general, I would recommend combining the contents of Suppl. Mat A, B and C into a single
text file with three separate sections. Suppl. Mat. D should be kept separate.

neral comments:
The type of networks studied in the present work models connectivity relationships among
logical habitats. In this regard, I am wondering about the specific mathematical structure
cribed in ll.93-99. If the main motivation would be species dispersal between spatially
connected patches, the corresponding ecological processes would be conveniently
resented by a flow, with A describing a stochastic matrix and a_{ij} being the probability of a
domly selected individual to migrate from patch I to patch j within a given time unit. In that
e, I would normally expect a_{ii}>0 (in fact, eventually close to 1). Since the authors choose
istinctively different setting with a_[ii}=0, I would in turn appreciate if they could add a few
ds to clarify which specific ecological processes are modelled by their adjacency matrix.
ponse: We have clarified that we are defining a randomly-generated adjacency matrix
cribing the cost of species movement between patches. Indeed, depending on the structure of
model, if we were concerned with a species interaction matrix or an unweighted spatial
work then the diagonals would correspond to the growth rate of the species and would need
equal zero. We note this in footnote number three.
Ll.102-103: While I generally agree with this statement, one could easily replace the
weighted) node degree by the (weighted) node strength to obtain an appropriate and
logically meaningful per-node network characteristic.
ponse: True. We have amended the statement from "inappropriate" to "less appropriate" to
make the statement less strong.
Pp.10-11: In the description of the network generation algorithm, I understand that the
l stochastic step is necessary to achieve an agreement between resulting network properties
the user-defined criteria up to a certain tolerance. However, I don’t see that it guarantees
vergence to an optimal solution, but may also result in some local minimum of the
imization function (1.5). I agree that this is a pragmatic approach, but would recommend a
lines of discussion on convergence and optimality (also emphasizing on existence and
queness of the dedicated solution for a given set of r*, v* and s*). I explicitly don’t request
mathematical proof or additional results to be presented here, but would appreciate some
eral remarks in this direction. The authors partially address this point in their conclusions
3, ll.269-271). In a similar context, I would appreciate a short explanation of the reasons for
non-convergence of the algorithm for very small v, as well as for jointly high values of v and
s shown in Fig. 2.
ponse: At the end of the results section (lines 243-252) we now include a discussion on the
ors limiting the convergence of the algorithm. Specifically, we discuss three: lower and
er bounds on the feasible values of the variance and skewness of the dominant eigenvector,
tness" of the concave function in (5) caused by the values of the desired network metrics and
r weights, and local versus global minima.
hnical comments:
P.2, l.41: “criteria” => “criterion”
P.5, ll.108-110: I am no native speaker, but would find the article “the” in front of the term

P.5, l.109: “there exist”(?)
P.7, l.143: “of a wide…”
P.7, l.160: “highlights”(?)
ponse: We have modified the text accordingly.
P.8, ll.174-175: This sentence still reads a bit odd, what about: “We choose the entries of
so that they minimize the weighted sum of squared differences between the properties of our
w” adjacency matrix and our user-defined criteria, resulting in the following minimization
blem:”
ponse: Thank you for your suggestion. We have changed the sentence.
P.9, l.186: “form an”
P.9, l.196: “given by an”
ponse: Corrected.
Enumeration of equations: Why do you use (1.1) to (1.6) instead of just (1) to (6)?
ponse: We have changed the numbering format in the text.
Tab. 1: Should the “Basal” algorithm just read “Bansal algorithm”?
ponse: Yes.
Fig. 1: Please explain briefly why you have a physical unit [km] for the spectral radius.
ponse: Figures 1 and 2 were adapted from Salau et al. (2015), which was focused on prairie
dispersal between spatially isolated colonies. We have removed the unit (km) from the
ts.
Since the Supplementary Material is no Appendix included in the main body of the
nuscript, it should contain all references cited within (i.e., in SM A, citations of Salau et al.
15) and Cao (1998) should be given explicitly again).
ponse: Yes. Done.
Suppl. Mat. A, Proposition 1: It seems to me that some of the steps are restricted to certain
cific properties of the networks studied in the main paper and do not hold in general (e.g., the
inequality in eq. (S4)). Please carefully include all corresponding prerequisites in the
position.
ponse: We now specify that in our framework we assume the existence of a positive
minant eigenvalue, and for our habitat example, a square adjacency matrix with off-diagonal
ries greater than zero. We then direct the reader to Horn and Johnson (1990) and Caswell
01), which provide conditions for more general non-negative matrices with positive dominant
envalues.
Suppl. Mat. B, Proposition 2: Do you have any reference for eq. (S6)? In addition, I would
gest adding a brief explanation for the positivity in eq. (S7).
ponse: We cite Salau et al. (2015) as a reference for equation S6. We also clarify in
tnote 4 in the main text and lines 42-43 and 92-94 in the Supplemental Material that the
itivity of the expected value in equation S7 lies in the fact that our adjacency matrix has a
itive dominant eigenvalue. This means that the elements of the associated eigenvector are
positive (Caswell 2001).
Suppl. Mat. C: Why do you separate Figs. S2 and S3 instead of combining them into a
gle three-panel figure?
ponse: Separating Figures S2 and S3 is simply for readability. We feel that combining them
a single figure makes the text and markers quite small and difficult to read.
In general, I would recommend combining the contents of Suppl. Mat A, B and C into a
gle text file with three separate sections. Suppl. Mat. D should be kept separate.
ponse: Done.
