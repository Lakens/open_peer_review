Responses to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
Thank you for your valuable suggestions. Our responses to your questions are listed below.
(1) First of all an explanation given in the abstract and also in the introduction part for replying to
the question, why do they think that this work is so important and to what extent there are new
prospects for the estimation of the lifetime prediction of rubber deriving from their research?
Response: The thermal oxidative aging reaction of rubber material will accelerate with the
increase of temperature, which will lead to the decline of the anti-fatigue property of it. Under
the action of repeated loads, fatigue failure is easy to be caused, then potential safety hazard
are generated. Therefore, the effective prediction of fatigue life at different temperatures is of
great significance for timely replacement and extension of service life of rubber products.The
motivation of this study, including why the work is important and its application prospect
have been added to the introduction. All the corrections are marked in red in the paper.
(2) What is new in comparison to other studies already done?
Response: At present, the prediction of rubber fatigue life under the influence of temperature
is faced with two major difficulties. On the one hand, it is necessary to carry out the
corresponding fatigue test and establish a model to analyze the fatigue characteristics of such
parts because of the large variation of ambient temperature and complex loading conditions.
On the other hand, how to establish the relationship between temperature and fatigue life
model to predict the rubber fatigue life at different temperatures.
However, the prominent scholars only studied the fatigue characteristics under the
influence of temperature from the perspective of the type of rubber materials and the selection
of fatigue damage parameters, and no model was established to relate the relationship between
temperature and fatigue life prediction.
The difference between this study and other studies already done is that this study solves
two major difficulties in predicting the fatigue life of rubber under the influence of
temperature. Based on the above analysis, the uniaxial tensile fatigue tests of dumbbell rubber
specimens are carried out at different temperatures and different loading in this study. The
fatigue life prediction model is established with strain energy as the fatigue damage parameter,
and the fatigue characteristics under different temperature are predicted by the relationship
between the model parameters and temperature.
(3) Why did the authors use only this experimental data and not, e.g., rheological data and creep
tests?
Response: Rheological data and creep test are important applications in the study of materials.
However, the fatigue life of rubber is studied in this paper. The reasons for not using
rheological data and creep tests are as follows:
1) Creep test is a kind of mechanical property test to measure the slow plastic deformation
of material under the constant temperature and constant stress for a long time. Creep failure
life is not the same as fatigue life. Creep is that under a certain temperature and stress, even
if the applied stress is lower than the yield limit at this temperature, the material will still
appear slow plastic deformation, and finally creep cracks will lead to the failure of the material.
The time before creep failure is called creep failure life. Fatigue damage occurs in parts and
members subjected to alternating stress (or strain), which are subjected to repeated
alternating stress (or strain) below the yield limit of the material, and after a certain number
of cycles. When a crack is initiated at a stress concentration site, the crack propagates under
certain conditions and finally suddenly fracture. This failure process is called fatigue failure.
2) According to the constitutive model of materials, the creep mainly refers to viscoelastic
materials, and rheological multi-finger viscous materials.
To sum up, the stress-strain data are used to test the fatigue life of rubber, but not
rheological data and creep test.
(4) What is the experimental error of the measurements?
Response: According to the comments from you, we queried the relevant parameters of the
100-100 (200) WH oven type universal material testing machine in Section 3.2. The accuracy
of the uniaxial tensile test is better than ±1%. The related modifications are marked in red in
the paper.
(5) What is the fitting errors of the used models for the calculation of the fatigue life of the rubber?
Response: There are usually three types of the error for fitting results: sum of squares of errors
(SSE), mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). SSE is the sum of
squares of the errors corresponding to the fitting data and the original data. The closer the
SSE is to 0, the better the model selection and fitting are, and the more successful the data
prediction is. MSE is the mean of the square sum of errors corresponding to the predicted
data and the original data. RMSE is the fitting standard deviation of regression system and
the square root of MSE. The relationship among the three types is MSE = 1 SSE ,
n
RMSE = MSE . The correlation coefficient r 2 that is defined as the ratio of sum of squares of
the regression (SSR) to total sum of squares (SST) is used to evaluate the fitting degree of the
model in this study. SSR is the sum of squares of the regression,and SST is the total sum of
squares.
The related formula is as follows:
n n
SSR = <U+F0E5> wi (<U+F073>ˆ i - <U+F073> i )2 SST = <U+F0E5> wi (<U+F073> i - <U+F073> i )2
i =1 , i =1
Where <U+F073>ˆ i is the prediction SSR dataSSTand SSE <U+F073> i is raw data - SSE
= SSTand
SSRmean <U+F073> i is the raw data.
The relationship among , and is that .
The formula of correlation coefficient can be expressed by r 2 = SSR SST - SSE SSE .
= = 1-
SST SST SST
2
Therefore, the correlation coefficient r can include the evaluation of fitting error, and the
variation of data can be used to characterize a fitting. What’s more, compared with SSR, it
can better reflect the fitting precision.
(6) What is the advantage of the use of the specific model?
Response: The fatigue life prediction model is established with strain energy as the fatigue
damage parameter and with temperature as the variable in this study. The advantage of it is
that the predicted value of it is close to the measured value and the average relative error is
within the acceptable range. Compared with the fatigue crack initiation method to predict the
fatigue life at different temperatures, it can predict the fatigue life is more flexible and concise.
When predicting the fatigue life of rubber at different temperatures, it doesn’t need to be
solved by experiments with temperature as a variable. What’s more, the prediction error of it
is smaller than the fatigue crack initiation method. Therefore, the prediction model established
in this study is accurate and effective. The related modifications are marked in red in the paper.
(7) The beginning of the abstract is not that nicely written. Please re-write it.
Response: Thanks for your suggestions. According to the comments from you, we have revised
the abstract of the article. The related modifications are marked in red in the paper.
Reviewer #2:
Thank you for your valuable suggestions. Our responses to your questions are listed below.
(1) The title is inappropriate, it can be “Strain energy-based rubber fatigue life prediction under the
influence of temperature”;
Response: The title of the article has been revised as required.
(2) For the rubber materials in the current work, the thermal aging under temperature effect is fully
different from the fatigue failure mechanism, actually they interact with each other, please specify
the boundary between them, especially under different temperatures;
Response: The thermal aging of rubber mainly refers to the thermal-oxidative aging reaction,
which is the oxidation catalytic reaction initiated by ROOH. With the increase of temperature,
the oxidation reaction intensifies, which leads to the cracking or structuring of rubber
molecules and the destruction of rubber materials. The fatigue failure mechanism of rubber
material is that the repeated change of rubber specimen under load leads to repeated
alternating stress below the yield limit and the failure of rubber specimen. The two kinds of
failure interact with each other and cause damage to the fatigue life of rubber at the same time.
When the temperature is low, the thermal-oxidative aging reaction is gentle, the damage
degree of molecular chain small, the molecular chain close and the microcosmic gap small.
The molecular movement of rubber materials accelerates with the increase of temperature,
and the thermal oxygen aging reaction also accelerates. The molecular chains continue to
expand and polymerize repeatedly under the load. With the increase of micro-cracks,
macroscopic cracks and relaxation degree increase, and irreversible plastic deformation
occurs, which leads to the failure of rubber materials. The related modifications are marked
in red in the paper.
(3) In Section 2, the background and motivation of current work should be strengthened;
Response: The background and motivation of the current work have been added and refined
in the introduction. The related modifications are marked in red in the paper.
(4) In Fig. 1, the unit mm should be given in the figure title;
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out the problem of missing units in our
manuscript. We have added it to the title in figure 1.
(5) In Section 3.2, the reference should be added to “GB6672”;
Response: We have been revised to “the dumbbell rubber specimen was cut according to the
standard in the document GB6672‘plastic film and sheeting—Determination of thickness by
mechanical scanning’” and moved it to Section 3.1. The document GB6672 also has been
added to the reference. The related modifications are marked in red in the paper.
(6) In Section 4, the statement “There are two kinds of methods suiting for fatigue life prediction of
rubber materials. One is crack growth life…another is crack initiation life…” is not correct, these
two kinds methods are for fatigue analysis under different phases, moreover, there are lots of recent
publications on this topic, please clarify this statement; more information can be referred from
“International Journal of Fatigue, 2018, 113: 33-42” and “Structural Engineering and Mechanics,
2018, 66(2): 151-160.”
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this question in our manuscript. According
to the comments from you, we have corrected it in Section 4 with reference to relevant
references. The related modifications are marked in red in the paper.
(7) In Section 4.2, more contents are needed for specifying the “strain energy density” method, like
plastic strain energy density or total one? Also Eq. (2) should be clarified more clearly;
Response: The relevant contents of plastic strain energy density method have been added and
improved in Section 4.2 of the paper. The related modifications are marked in red in the paper.
According to the comments from you, we have added a equation that is now number (4.1) to
clarify the Eq. (4.2), which is number (2) before the modification. The related modifications
are marked in red in the paper.
(8) Please remove the items “<U+3001> ” in the text;
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this error in our manuscript. We have
corrected it in the paper.
(9) In Section 4.3, the physical meanings of constitutive model parameters should be clarified, also
the corresponding units should be added in the tables;
Response: The content of the physical meaning of the material parameters of the Yoeh
hyperelastic constitutive model has been added and improved in Section 4.3. The related
modifications are marked in red in the paper. The corresponding units have been added in the
tables.
(10) In Section 5, the authors introduced a power law for rubber fatigue life model, which is actually
a S-N curve model, any other commonly used models for comparison?
Response: A power law for rubber fatigue life model can be solved by the local stress-strain
method and nominal stress method. The nominal stress method is based on the theory of
mechanics of materials or elasticity, and the nominal stress of dangerous point can be
calculated by S-N curve, which is suitable for the condition that the stress level is not high and
the load is relatively stable. The local stress-strain method relates the fatigue life of a certain
point in the dangerous area. It assumed that the stress-strain history of the dangerous area is
the same as that of the smooth specimen, which is suitable for the condition of high stress level
and local yield of the material. Based on the fact that the stress range is small and the load is
stable, the nominal stress method can be used to solve the fatigue life in this study. The related
modifications are marked in red in the paper.
(11) In Section 5.2.2, the authors fit the k and b parameters by a polynomial function of temperature,
they use the same set of experimental data for fitting, then reuse them for prediction?
Response: The nine sets of data used to build the model were from dumbbell rubber specimens,
and the data used to verify the model was from another group of rubber specimens with the
same rubber formula. Therefore, the experimental data used in these two places are not from
the same set of rubber specimens.
(12) The conclusion section should be shortened and model concise.
Response: The conclusion of the paper has been reduced as required. The related modifications
are marked in red in the paper.
