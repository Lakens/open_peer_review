label_comment_1
Arctic ecosystems are being strongly impacted by climate change, leading to bottom up effects
that impact top predators. For example, temperate fish, particularly capelin, are moving into
Arctic ecosystems. The authors examine the isotope signature of belugas, ringed seals, char and
their prey over a 20 year period. In the recent period, the species occupy less isotopic space than
in the earlier period.
While the data is certainly useful, I found the authors often went well beyond what was shown
by their data. They really want to show that an increase in capelin has led to an overlap
('redundancy') in the isotope signatures. However, because of the caveats listed below (especially
that they have no way of separating capelin from other forage fish), they cannot really draw any
conclusions about food webs. The authors would be much better off to hew closer to what their
data actually show rather than speculating about what could be happening in terms of food web
functioning.
1. The authors show that the isotopic signature of predators is slightly different between two time
points. Almost certainly, it is. Due to random year-to-year stochasticity, two different time
periods will have, on average, slightly different isotopic signatures when examined across four
species. The authors then describe those differences as “associated with interactions among
abiotic and biotic variables including decreased sea ice concentration, increased summer sea
surface temperature and changes to forage fish species composition.” They have no evidence for
cause-and-effect. Yes, isotopic signatures (and diet) change over time, but that does not mean
those changes are a consequence of bottom-up response to climate change.
2. The 1990-2002 vs 2005-2012 period seems arbitrary. The authors obtained their results by
comparing two time periods: 1990-2002 and 2005-2012. They justify that split by saying that Inuit
encountered no capelin in stomachs in the 1990s (Do they encounter more now? Do you have any
formal interviews or is that just based on hearsay?) and a significant decrease in beluga whale
d15N and sympagic carbon source use for both beluga whales and ringed seals after the early
2000s in Cumberland Sound. Having examined those two papers, I find it hard to justify a large
shift between the two time periods. Rather, it seems like the authors arbitrarily chose a time point
that gave them the results they were searching for.
3. Most of the results are based on Bayesian mixing models that are known to be dubious at best.
Discrimination factors are often age, sex and species-specific, and, as can be seen from the Caut
papers, relying on a discrimination factor from another study includes a great degree of
uncertainty, which the model cannot completely account for. Similarly, as they recognize in the
supplementary materials, isotopic baselines could be changing between the two time periods,
influencing results (all three species in Table 1 that are shown across the two time periods are
depleted in d13C in the earlier period, though not significantly so). Finally, the authors are almost
certainly missing some prey items; it is essential for mixing models that all prey items are
included. Thus, the diet proportions in Figure 1 have high uncertainty, and could be completely
inaccurate. Just because you can put numbers into a model and get an output, doesn’t mean that
output is reliable.
4. Much of the interpretation is based on capelin vs. cod, yet they cannot distinguish between the
two as they overlap isotopically.
5. The paper came across as being written in a rush. There are quite a few typos and poorly
worded sections.

Minor comments.
L 18 “However, the effects of such climate-driven species redistributions on the trophic ecology
of high trophic-level predator assemblages and associated implications on ecosystem function
have not been quantified.” In contrast, some of the papers you cite have clearly shown changes in
the foraging ecology of predators.
L 39 “Biodiversity within marine ecosystems varies across environmental gradients but is
ultimately mediated by temperature, which in turn regulates the ecological functioning of marine
ecosystems”. That is an oversimplification, even compared to the summary in the Tittensor
paper. Salinity, currents, coastline length, etc. are also important. Indeed, one of the two groups
that are in the current paper and also included in the Tittensor paper (pinnipeds) shows exactly
the opposite trend to the one described in the paragraph. Suggest “Biodiversity within marine
ecosystems varies across environmental gradients, of which temperature is one of the most
important, which in turn can regulate functioning of marine ecosystems.”
L 46. “Climatic driven ecosystem shifts are most pronounced in the Arctic”. Alpine shifts are
often more pronounced.
L 58. “Arctic cod are typically associated with colder water temperatures (<0°C) with near
maximal growth at 5°C [17], therefore declining sea ice and a warming ocean, especially at lower
latitudes, will continue to alter the timing of Arctic cod reproduction and larval development and
lead to a northward retraction in its range [16].”
Bouchard et al. 2017 found the exact opposite. Bouchard, C., Geoffroy, M., LeBlanc, M., Majewski,
A., Gauthier, S., Walkusz, W., Reist, J.D. and Fortier, L., 2017. Climate warming enhances polar
cod recruitment, at least transiently. Progress in Oceanography, 156, pp.121-129.
L 65. “Capelin are considered a sea ‘canary’ for a warming climate in colder marine ecosystems as
their presence and abundance increase with temperature”. What is so special about capelin? Like
any fish, they have an optimal temperature regime. The second part of your statement isn’t
globally correct. In the St Lawrence or Gulf of Alaska, their presence and abundance decreases
with temperature, and they are considered indicators of cold water regimes.
L 77 “Here, we examine the diet and isotopic niche of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas),
ringed seals, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and anadromous Arctic char
(Salvelinus aplinus) across a temporal scale that captures a rapid warming period and where
capelin have become increasingly abundant since the mid-2000s [18]” This is a critical statement,
yet the reference is to an article in Iceland, pers. obs. (why not include them in your paper) and to
a figure in the paper itself. It is circular to justify your choice of a mid-2000s shift on your own
data.
82. “Beluga whales consume forage fish [Arctic cod and more recently capelin [25,26,27],”
Presumably beluga have been feeding on capelin for a long time, though proportions appear to
be increasing. Given the rest of the paragraph, this sentence seems to imply that the beluga are
feeding on capelin in Cumberland Sound, yet only one citation is from Cumberland Sound.
Suggest “Beluga whales consume forage fish [Arctic cod and, increasingly, capelin [26],”
92. Why the leap to African lakes?
116. “Traditional ecological knowledge on beluga whales inhabiting Southeast Baffin Island does
not report the occurrence of capelin in beluga whale stomachs in the 1990s”. It is not ‘traditional
ecological knowledge’ if it refers to knowledge about stomach contents in the 1990s. Why not just
say “Inuit hunters did not report…”?
4
L 161. A logit transformation is usually preferable to an arcsin transformation.
The Discussion strays far from the Results, and could likely be shortened.
273 “our study provides the first evidence for a simultaneous diet and isotopic niche shift of
several sympatric higher trophic position predator species over the past two decades”. There are
many studies that examine diet of multiple predator species over time (often periods longer than
two decades), perhaps spread out over several papers, including some that you cite. Why a
simultaneous ‘diet’ and ‘isotope’ shift? Your ‘diet’ shifts are inferred from the ‘isotope’ shifts.
L 296. “though with a decreasing reliance on Arctic cod and increase in capelin in diet over time”.
To retain parallel structure, should be “and increasing reliance on capelin” or “decrease in Arctic
cod”
L 298. “In addition, Cumberland Sound beluga whales dive to shallower depths (0 – 100m) in the
summer compared to the late-autumn and winter where dives are >400m, suggesting a seasonal
switch from foraging on forage fish in shallower waters to deep-water Greenland halibut – a
species whose abundance has been stable over time [29,65]. Diving is energetically expensive for
marine mammals, especially to deeper depths (>400m) where larger Greenland halibut reside
[44].” Diving is not energetically expensive. In fact, energy expenditure is likely suppressed
during deep dives due to reduced heart rate and blood perfusion. There may be costs associated
with diving, but higher energy expenditure is unlikely to be one of them. Also, could they be
diving to get benthic Arctic cod rather than halibut?
L 304. Overall size is likely far more important than a small difference in energy density, which is
likely size-dependent as well.
L 306. This is the third reference to ‘unpublished data’ or ‘personal observations’. Why not just
include the data in the paper?

Abstract:
Line 22: I don’t think that Greenland halibut and Arctic char should be considered or described as
near-apex predator. How did you define or decide that you would combine beluga and ringed
seals within the same category of “near-apex predator” with these two species of fish?
Introduction:
Line 57: “are likely undergoing” – please rephrase this sentence and add a more recent citation on
the linkages between arctic cod abundance/distribution and sea ice dynamics.
Line 83: Reference is missing.
Line 84: Add a few examples of which benthic invertebrates are preyed upon by beluga whales
(e.g., refer to Loseto et al.)
Line 95: Any examples of similar studies in higher latitudes? If not, add a sentence to highlight
the gap in the Arctic and how your study is addressing it.
Material and methods
Line 111: Why did you only consider the month of June? This sentence should be rewritten as
follow: “Sea ice concentration for the Davis Strait was also estimated for the same period (1990-
2012) for the month of June.” Maybe add a sentence to explain why the other months were not
considered.
Line 134: “due to its slower turn-over rate” – relative to what? Skin? Blood?
Line 134: This sentence is not clear. Shrimp and Arctic cod are the principal prey items of which
species? If they are for all 4 predators used in this study, then it should be mentioned.
Line 137: Need to write fully where the samples came from. As it reads now, it only refers to [47].
Same comment applies for Line 131.
Lines 139-141: I suggest that you used published SI values in Themisto as this hyperiid amphipod
is an important potential prey item to most of the species used in this study. An explanation as to
why Gonatid was used instead of Themisto is needed.
Lines 144-148: Did you take into consideration the effects of lipid-extraction on d15N? Did you
analyze d15N on lipid-extracted and non-lipid extracted samples to assess the effects of lipid-
extraction on d15N?
Discussion
Lines 287-291: These two sentences are literally saying the same thing.
6
Lines 325-328: The sentence is long and I would suggest rewriting and avoiding repetitive words
“….increasing sea temperatures [9], an increase in the summer sea surface temperature…”
Line 341: Provide some examples of potential consequences on food web structure.
Line 377: I recommend rewriting “several near-apex predator” (see my comment above)

Comments to the Author:
The authors furnish decadal data on ocean temperature, sea ice cover, and the trophic structure of
apex marine predators (inferred from stable isotopes). The ms is generally well written and easy
to follow. The ms was reviewed by two experts, both of whom were enthusiastic about the
dataset. Nevertheless, one of the reviewers raised serious concerns about the interpretation of the
data, arbitrary temporal "bins", and the suitability/rigor of the mixed models employed. I agree
with these criticisms, and felt they were fair and constructive. Such issues have lead to a
somewhat diluted (and perhaps conflated) ms. The authors can streamline the discussion to the
data, and refrain from unnecessary extrapolation. I thought the 5-page-long discussion section
could be shortened considerably. With much gratitude to the expert reviewers, I invite the
authors to revise this ms reporting very interesting data. It has a lot of potential, particularly if
the data are analyzed and interpreted more parsimoniously.

Arctic ecosystems are being strongly impacted by climate change, leading to bottom up effects

their prey over a 20 year period. In the recent period, the species occupy less isotopic space than
in the earlier period.
While the data is certainly useful, I found the authors often went well beyond what was shown

that they have no way of separating capelin from other forage fish), they cannot really draw any
conclusions about food webs. The authors would be much better off to hew closer to what their
data actually show rather than speculating about what could be happening in terms of food web
functioning.
1. The authors show that the isotopic signature of predators is slightly different between two time
points. Almost certainly, it is. Due to random year-to-year stochasticity, two different time
9
periods will have, on average, slightly different isotopic signatures when examined across four
species. The authors then describe those differences as “associated with interactions among
abiotic and biotic variables including decreased sea ice concentration, increased summer sea
surface temperature and changes to forage fish species composition.” They have no evidence for
cause-and-effect. Yes, isotopic signatures (and diet) change over time, but that does not mean
those changes are a consequence of bottom-up response to climate change.
2. The 1990-2002 vs 2005-2012 period seems arbitrary. The authors obtained their results by
comparing two time periods: 1990-2002 and 2005-2012. They justify that split by saying that Inuit
encountered no capelin in stomachs in the 1990s (Do they encounter more now? Do you have any
formal interviews or is that just based on hearsay?) and a significant decrease in beluga whale
d15N and sympagic carbon source use for both beluga whales and ringed seals after the early
2000s in Cumberland Sound. Having examined those two papers, I find it hard to justify a large
shift between the two time periods. Rather, it seems like the authors arbitrarily chose a time point
that gave them the results they were searching for.
3. Most of the results are based on Bayesian mixing models that are known to be dubious at best.
Discrimination factors are often age, sex and species-specific, and, as can be seen from the Caut

influencing results (all three species in Table 1 that are shown across the two time periods are
depleted in d13C in the earlier period, though not significantly so). Finally, the authors are almost
certainly missing some prey items; it is essential for mixing models that all prey items are
included. Thus, the diet proportions in Figure 1 have high uncertainty, and could be completely
inaccurate. Just because you can put numbers into a model and get an output, doesn’t mean that
output is reliable.
4. Much of the interpretation is based on capelin vs. cod, yet they cannot distinguish between the
two as they overlap isotopically.
5. The paper came across as being written in a rush. There are quite a few typos and poorly

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
Comments to the Author:
The authors furnish decadal data on ocean temperature, sea ice cover, and the
trophic structure of apex marine predators (inferred from stable isotopes). The
ms is generally well written and easy to follow. The ms was reviewed by two
experts, both of whom were enthusiastic about the dataset. Nevertheless, one
of the reviewers raised serious concerns about the interpretation of the data,
arbitrary temporal "bins", and the suitability/rigor of the mixed models
employed. I agree with these criticisms, and felt they were fair and
constructive. Such issues have lead to a somewhat diluted (and perhaps
conflated) ms. The authors can streamline the discussion to the data, and
refrain from unnecessary extrapolation. I thought the 5-page-long discussion
section could be shortened considerably. With much gratitude to the expert
reviewers, I invite the authors to revise this ms reporting very interesting data.
It has a lot of potential, particularly if the data are analyzed and interpreted
more parsimoniously.
RESPONSE: We thank the editors for evaluating our manuscript and
having the opportunity to submit a revised version. We thank the
reviewers for their thoughtful constructive comments and suggestions
which improved the manuscript as a whole. We have incorporated and
addressed all of their comments in the manuscript and in comments
below. To accommodate reviewer 1’s concerns, we have removed
paragraphs regarding food web structure and function and have instead
focused on implications from our results (i.e. describing the diet shift
among the predator assemblage and that this predator assemblage is now
more trophically redundant than before). This has shortened the
Discussion from 5 to 4 pages and is therefore more streamlined and
succinct.
We provide several lines of evidence for the justification of the time
periods (see response to comment 2) as well as the statistical rigor of our
results from mixing model analysis (see response to comment 3)
Comments to Author:
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Arctic ecosystems are being strongly impacted by climate change, leading to
bottom up effects that impact top predators. For example, temperate fish,
particularly capelin, are moving into Arctic ecosystems. The authors examine
the isotope signature of belugas, ringed seals, char and their prey over a 20
year period. In the recent period, the species occupy less isotopic space than in
the earlier period.
While the data is certainly useful, I found the authors often went well beyond
what was shown by their data. They really want to show that an increase in
capelin has led to an overlap ('redundancy') in the isotope signatures.
However, because of the caveats listed below (especially that they have no
way of separating capelin from other forage fish), they cannot really draw any
conclusions about food webs. The authors would be much better off to hew
closer to what their data actually show rather than speculating about what
could be happening in terms of food web functioning.
RESPONSE: We have removed much of the discussion regarding food
web function (two paragraphs) and mainly focus on implications from
our results (i.e. describing the diet shift among the predator assemblage
and that this predator assemblage is now more trophically redundant
than before). This has shortened the Discussion from 5 to 4 pages and is
therefore more succinct.
1. The authors show that the isotopic signature of predators is slightly
different between two time points. Almost certainly, it is. Due to random year-
to-year stochasticity, two different time periods will have, on average, slightly
different isotopic signatures when examined across four species. The authors
then describe those differences as “associated with interactions among abiotic
and biotic variables including decreased sea ice concentration, increased
summer sea surface temperature and changes to forage fish species
composition.” They have no evidence for cause-and-effect. Yes, isotopic
signatures (and diet) change over time, but that does not mean those changes
are a consequence of bottom-up response to climate change.
RESPONSE: We agree that there is likely small inter-annual variation in
the isotopic values of these predator species, however we describe large
isotopic and trophic shifts in the system which would be greater than
random year-to-year stochasticity. We agree that we cannot discern a
cause-effect without statistically testing relationships between
environmental variables and our diet and trophic structure results.
However, these biotic changes are correlated/associated with the abiotic
changes we found over the same time period (1990-2012) and this is
clearly stated in lines 273-276. Overall, we observed less sea ice, warmer
waters, increased forage fish consumption and more trophic redundancy
in 2005-2012 versus 1990-2002 when there was more sea ice, cooler
waters, less consumption of forage fish and more trophic diversity in the
predator assemblage.
2. The 1990-2002 vs 2005-2012 period seems arbitrary. The authors
obtained their results by comparing two time periods: 1990-2002 and 2005-
2012. They justify that split by saying that Inuit encountered no capelin in
stomachs in the 1990s (Do they encounter more now? Do you have any
formal interviews or is that just based on hearsay?) and a significant decrease
in beluga whale d15N and sympagic carbon source use for both beluga whales
and ringed seals after the early 2000s in Cumberland Sound. Having examined
those two papers, I find it hard to justify a large shift between the two time
periods. Rather, it seems like the authors arbitrarily chose a time point that
gave them the results they were searching for.
RESPONSE: Coupled with observations from prominent local hunters
(albeit not from formal interviews), researchers (see line 79), the
Carscadden et al. 2013 – Prog Oceanography, remains of capelin from
ringed seal (see Fig. S5) and Arctic char (see Supp Mat. from Yurkowski
et al. 2017 – Biol Lett) stomachs, and the significant decrease in d15N and
sympagic carbon source use mentioned in both papers the reviewer
describes (Brown et al. 204 and 2017 – L&O), we feel confident in the
splitting of both time periods to encompass changes that began in the
early to mid-2000s. We even provided additional analysis using the time
period of 2007-2012 – see lines 224-226 - which provided even stronger
results on a temporal shift in diet estimates and the trophic structure of
this predator assemblage (see section in supplementary materials).
Altogether, we feel confident that the diets of these predators have
changed significantly between time periods (1990-2002 versus 2005-2012
and 2007-2012) and in turn, the structure of this predator assemblage.
3. Most of the results are based on Bayesian mixing models that are known
to be dubious at best. Discrimination factors are often age, sex and species-
specific, and, as can be seen from the Caut papers, relying on a discrimination
factor from another study includes a great degree of uncertainty, which the
model cannot completely account for. Similarly, as they recognize in the
supplementary materials, isotopic baselines could be changing between the
two time periods, influencing results (all three species in Table 1 that are
shown across the two time periods are depleted in d13C in the earlier period,
though not significantly so). Finally, the authors are almost certainly missing
some prey items; it is essential for mixing models that all prey items are
included. Thus, the diet proportions in Figure 1 have high uncertainty, and
could be completely inaccurate. Just because you can put numbers into a
model and get an output, doesn’t mean that output is reliable.
RESPONSE: We agree that there are many uncertainties regarding
Bayesian mixing models but if used correctly, can be powerful tools in the
toolbox of isotope ecologists. There can be variation in diet-tissue
discrimination factors between individuals of a predator species
dependent on age (growth) and sex but the effects are generally small (see
Hobson & Quirk 2014 IEHS; Browning et al. 2014 – JEB). The principal
factor affecting DTDF variation is diet (i.e. protein quality and quantity)
which we use published values from harp seals (Hobson et al. 1996) and
killer whales (Caut et al. 2011) fed a high protein diet for ringed seals and
beluga, respectively. Therefore, these DTDFs would be representative of
‘wild’ piscivorous pinnipeds (ringed seals) and cetaceans (beluga). We use
DTDF values estimated from linear equations developed for Arctic char
and Greenland halibut by Caut et al. 2009 (J Appl. Ecol. – cited 798
times) which was a meta-analysis on DTDF discrimination variation.
Bayesian mixing models like SIAR can also include uncertainty around
the DTDF (i.e. standard deviation where we used 0.2 in our case) which
can account for DTDF uncertainty in mixing analysis.
We discuss in supplementary materials that changing isotopic baselines
through Oceanic Suess effect and increased temperature would be
negligible (<0.2‰ for d13C and d15N) given the magnitude of change we
describe through mixing model and trophic structure analyses.
In regards to prey, we have included the main prey functional groups (i.e.
pelagic and benthic fish and invertebrates) in an informed way to obtain
the most reliable results. The addition of many prey items (5-7) for a two-
element mixing model would lead to a less constrained, more diffuse
solution where prey items would likely have high correlations with each
other (this caveat is mentioned in lines 168-172). This would provide high
uncertainty in our model outputs (phillips et al. 2014 - CJZ. A main prey
item, Themisto libellula (mentioned by reviewer 2 and in lines 139-142)
could not be included due to not being sampled from the general
Cumberland Sound area in the ‘early’ time period. Therefore, we used
Gonatid squid (who are also an omnivorous invertebrate) to represent
this functional group (lines 139-142). Hobson et al. 2002 – Deep Sea
Research is also cited where Themisto occupy a trophic position of 2.5
and have a similar d15N to Gonatid squid (10‰ versus 11‰). We also
include the 95% credible intervals for each prey contribution (see Figure
1 and Table 2).
4. Much of the interpretation is based on capelin vs. cod, yet they cannot
distinguish between the two as they overlap isotopically.
RESPONSE: Unfortunately, we cannot distinguish between capelin and
Arctic cod isotopic values due to their similarity, therefore we have
referred to this prey group as forage fish which is used throughout the
Results and Discussion sections. Bayesian mixing model analysis revealed
that the consumption of forage fish increased substantially for all four
predator species. This predator assemblage is now more trophically
redundant than before inferring increased consumption of a prey
functional group (i.e. in this case forage fish). Many predator species have
been documented to have decreased consumption of Arctic cod over time
(see Gaston et al. 2003 – Arctic, Provencher et al. 2012 – MEPS; Watt et
al. 2016; Vihtakari et al. 2018 Sci Rep) and with the increased prevalence
of capelin in Cumberland Sound, we speculate by suggesting this shift in
predator diet and trophic structure is likely due to capelin. This is
discussed in lines 292-293 and 313-325. We discuss temporal shifts in diet
among the predator assemblage in the context of forage fish – see lines
294-312.
5. The paper came across as being written in a rush. There are quite a few
typos and poorly worded sections.
RESPONSE: We have edited the manuscript and have removed the
couple typos and have shortened the discussion from 5 to 4 pages to
improve clarity and flow.
Minor comments.
6. L 18 “However, the effects of such climate-driven species redistributions
on the trophic ecology of high trophic-level predator assemblages and
associated implications on ecosystem function have not been quantified.” In
contrast, some of the papers you cite have clearly shown changes in the
foraging ecology of predators.
RESPONSE: We have revised this sentence which now states that “little
attention has been focused on effects of such climate-driven species
redistributions on the trophic ecology of a high trophic-level predator
assemblage”. – lines 18-20. While there are numerous studies examining
temporal shifts in foraging ecology of predators, there are scant details on
temporal shifts of a high trophic level predator assemblage (4 sympatric
predator species).
7. L 39 “Biodiversity within marine ecosystems varies across environmental
gradients but is ultimately mediated by temperature, which in turn regulates
the ecological functioning of marine ecosystems”. That is an
oversimplification, even compared to the summary in the Tittensor paper.
Salinity, currents, coastline length, etc. are also important. Indeed, one of the
two groups that are in the current paper and also included in the Tittensor
paper (pinnipeds) shows exactly the opposite trend to the one described in the
paragraph. Suggest “Biodiversity within marine ecosystems varies across
environmental gradients, of which temperature is one of the most important,
which in turn can regulate functioning of marine ecosystems.”
RESPONSE: We have revised sentence to reviewers’ suggestion – lines
39-40.
8. L 46. “Climatic driven ecosystem shifts are most pronounced in the Arctic”.
Alpine shifts are often more pronounced.
RESPONSE: We have removed “most” – line 46.
9. L 58. “Arctic cod are typically associated with colder water temperatures
(<0°C) with near maximal growth at 5°C [17], therefore declining sea ice and
a warming ocean, especially at lower latitudes, will continue to alter the
timing of Arctic cod reproduction and larval development and lead to a
northward retraction in its range [16].”
Bouchard et al. 2017 found the exact opposite. Bouchard, C., Geoffroy, M.,
LeBlanc, M., Majewski, A., Gauthier, S., Walkusz, W., Reist, J.D. and
Fortier, L., 2017. Climate warming enhances polar cod recruitment, at least
transiently. Progress in Oceanography, 156, pp.121-129.
RESPONSE: We have modified this sentence and state that Arctic cod
are typically associated with waters = 5°C (line 59). There are several
studies stating that cardio-respiratory performance declines at
temperatures above 5°C (Drost et al. 2016; JEB, 219:3114-3215) and it is
also stated in the Bouchard paper that eggs of polar cod typically develop
between -1 to 3.5°C but not beyond 5°C.
10. L 65. “Capelin are considered a sea ‘canary’ for a warming climate in
colder marine ecosystems as their presence and abundance increase with
temperature”. What is so special about capelin? Like any fish, they have an
optimal temperature regime. The second part of your statement isn’t globally
correct. In the St Lawrence or Gulf of Alaska, their presence and abundance
decreases with temperature, and they are considered indicators of cold water
regimes.
RESPONSE: Capelin are a highly plastic species and are found across a
broad range of temperatures. We now state that their distribution and
abundance generally increase with temperature (see Rose 2005) – lines
64-66.
11. L 77 “Here, we examine the diet and isotopic niche of beluga whales
(Delphinapterus leucas), ringed seals, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius
hippoglossoides) and anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus aplinus) across a
temporal scale that captures a rapid warming period and where capelin have
become increasingly abundant since the mid-2000s [18]” This is a critical
statement, yet the reference is to an article in Iceland, pers. obs. (why not
include them in your paper) and to a figure in the paper itself. It is circular to
justify your choice of a mid-2000s shift on your own data.
RESPONSE: The Carscadden et al. (2013) paper is a comprehensive
review on Capelin distributional changes in the Barents Sea and
Northwest Atlantic waters and not just Iceland as the reviewer indicates.
This paper also mentions community observations from Pangnirtung that
capelin became unusually abundant in 2004 and 2005. This has also been
observed by researchers and other prominent local hunters (mentioned as
pers. comm. in text – line 79). We have removed the reference to Fig. S5
though it clearly illustrates the consumption of capelin by ringed seals in
this system. Unfortunately, no data on Capelin abundance has been
collected anywhere across the Canadian Arctic but long-term changes to
predator diets can provide insight into abundance and distributional
changes in the prey community (see Gaston et al. 2003; Provencher et al.
2012).
12. L 82. “Beluga whales consume forage fish [Arctic cod and more recently
capelin [25,26,27],” Presumably beluga have been feeding on capelin for a
long time, though proportions appear to be increasing. Given the rest of the
paragraph, this sentence seems to imply that the beluga are feeding on capelin
in Cumberland Sound, yet only one citation is from Cumberland Sound.
Suggest “Beluga whales consume forage fish [Arctic cod and, increasingly,
capelin [26],”
RESPONSE: We have revised sentence to reviewers’ suggestion – lines
82-84.
13. L 92. Why the leap to African lakes?
RESPONSE: This has been changed to aquatic systems – lines 90-92.
14. L 116. “Traditional ecological knowledge on beluga whales inhabiting
Southeast Baffin Island does not report the occurrence of capelin in beluga
whale stomachs in the 1990s”. It is not ‘traditional ecological knowledge’ if it
refers to knowledge about stomach contents in the 1990s. Why not just say
“Inuit hunters did not report…”?
RESPONSE: We have modified sentence to reviewers’ suggestion – lines
116-119.
15. L 161. A logit transformation is usually preferable to an arcsin
transformation.
RESPONSE: We have now incorporated the results from logit
transformation and removed the arcsin transformation (lines 161-163).
16. The Discussion strays far from the Results, and could likely be shortened.
RESPONSE: We have removed much of the discussion regarding food
web function (two paragraphs) and mainly focus on implications from
our results (i.e. describing the diet shift among the predator assemblage
and that this predator assemblage is now more trophically redundant
than before). This has shortened the Discussion from 5 to 4 pages and is
therefore more succinct.
17. 273 “our study provides the first evidence for a simultaneous diet and
isotopic niche shift of several sympatric higher trophic position predator
species over the past two decades”. There are many studies that examine diet
of multiple predator species over time (often periods longer than two
decades), perhaps spread out over several papers, including some that you
cite. Why a simultaneous ‘diet’ and ‘isotope’ shift? Your ‘diet’ shifts are
inferred from the ‘isotope’ shifts.
RESPONSE: See response to comment 6. We have removed diet shift and
now only includes “isotopic niche shift”. See lines 270-273.
18. L 296. “though with a decreasing reliance on Arctic cod and increase in
capelin in diet over time”. To retain parallel structure, should be “and
increasing reliance on capelin” or “decrease in Arctic cod”
RESPONSE: We have modified sentence to reviewers’ suggestion – lines
294-295.
19. L 298. “In addition, Cumberland Sound beluga whales dive to shallower
depths (0 – 100m) in the summer compared to the late-autumn and winter
where dives are >400m, suggesting a seasonal switch from foraging on forage
fish in shallower waters to deep-water Greenland halibut – a species whose
abundance has been stable over time [29,65]. Diving is energetically
expensive for marine mammals, especially to deeper depths (>400m) where
larger Greenland halibut reside [44].” Diving is not energetically expensive. In
fact, energy expenditure is likely suppressed during deep dives due to reduced
heart rate and blood perfusion. There may be costs associated with diving, but
higher energy expenditure is unlikely to be one of them. Also, could they be
diving to get benthic Arctic cod rather than halibut?
RESPONSE: We have removed the sentences regarding the energetics of
diving and solely focus on seasonal changes in diving behaviour in the
context of potential prey availability (shallower dives in summer and
deeper dives in winter – lines 295-299). Beluga could also be diving
deeper for some other forage fish species, thus have changed the sentence
to, “deep-water fishes such as Greenland halibut”- line 298. However, it
is most likely Greenland halibut, as Yurkowski et al. (2017) – Biol Lett.
used a multi-tissue approach of different turnover rates to quantify
seasonal shifts in consumption of forage fish (more in summer) and
Greenland halibut (more in winter).
20. L 304. Overall size is likely far more important than a small difference in
energy density, which is likely size-dependent as well.
RESPONSE: Energetic components of prey have been removed.
21. L 306. This is the third reference to ‘unpublished data’ or ‘personal
observations’. Why not just include the data in the paper?
RESPONSE: We have now cited another paper (Giraldo et al. 2018 – J
Mar Syst) describing high consumption of Arctic cod by Greenland
halibut (see lines 303-305).
Reviewer: 2
22. Line 22: I don’t think that Greenland halibut and Arctic char should be
considered or described as near-apex predator. How did you define or decide
that you would combine beluga and ringed seals within the same category of
“near-apex predator” with these two species of fish?
RESPONSE: We disagree with this assertion that Arctic char and
Greenland halibut are not considered to be near-apex predators.
Greenland halibut and Arctic char are primarily piscivorous species with
Greenland halibut documented to be at trophic level 4-7 (see Hussey et al.
2014 -Ecol Lett). In this study, Arctic char also have similar d15N values
to ringed seals who have been documented to occupy near-top trophic
positions of (3.5-5) depending on latitude (see Yurkowski et al. 2016 –
Oecologia).
23. Line 57: “are likely undergoing” – please rephrase this sentence and add a
more recent citation on the linkages between arctic cod abundance/distribution
and sea ice dynamics.
RESPONSE: We now reference a study (Vihtakari et al. 2018 – Sci
Reports) who documented a decline in occurrence of Arctic cod in black-
legged kittiwake diet associated with sea ice dynamics. We also now cite
Kortsch et al. 2015 – Proc B [reference 3]) who report an abundance
decline of more-Arctic associated fish species, including Arctic cod, in the
Barents Sea over time (Lines 55-58). This relationship is linked with sea
temperature and decreasing sea ice.
24. Line 83: Reference is missing.
RESPONSE: This 1°C change refers to results from our paper and we
now state to see results – lines 82
25. Line 84: Add a few examples of which benthic invertebrates are preyed
upon by beluga whales (e.g., refer to Loseto et al.)
RESPONSE: We reference Loseto et al. 2009 here and now include
decapods and amphipods in the sentence (see lines 82-84).
26. Line 95: Any examples of similar studies in higher latitudes? If not, add a
sentence to highlight the gap in the Arctic and how your study is addressing it.
RESPONSE: We now describe that stable isotopes are a proven tool to
describe climate shifts on trophodynamics in polar environments and cite
a recent study examining seabird communities in Antarctica (Moreno et
al. 2016 – J Anim Ecol) – see lines 92-94.
27. Line 111: Why did you only consider the month of June? This sentence
should be rewritten as follow: “Sea ice concentration for the Davis Strait was
also estimated for the same period (1990-2012) for the month of June.”
Maybe add a sentence to explain why the other months were not considered.
RESPONSE: We have revised the sentence following the reviewers’
suggestion (lines 109-112) and briefly describe that June is a month which
partially encompasses the ice-breakup period in Cumberland Sound.
Also, sea ice concentration for the month of May is not fully recorded by
the Canadian Ice Service.
28. Line 134: “due to its slower turn-over rate” – relative to what? Skin?
Blood?
RESPONSE: We have modified this sentence and compare it to more-
metabolically active tissues (see lines 133-134).
29. Line 134: This sentence is not clear. Shrimp and Arctic cod are the
principal prey items of which species? If they are for all 4 predators used in
this study, then it should be mentioned.
RESPONSE: The term ‘principal prey items’ has been removed – see
lines 134-138.
30. Line 137: Need to write fully where the samples came from. As it reads
now, it only refers to [47]. Same comment applies for Line 131.
RESPONSE: We now state that Arctic char samples were collected from
northern Cumberland Sound near Lake Kipisa and Isuituq from Ulrich
2013 (lines 129-131). We also detail the collections of other prey samples
from fishing trawls and where those trawls generally took place (see lines
135-139).
31. Lines 139-141: I suggest that you used published SI values in Themisto as
this hyperiid amphipod is an important potential prey item to most of the
species used in this study. An explanation as to why Gonatid was used instead
of Themisto is needed.
RESPONSE: We agree that Themisto is an important prey item for many
of these predators however, stable isotopes values (or samples) for
Themisto were not available from the general Cumberland Sound area
during the 1990-2002 time period. Therefore, we used Gonatid squid
(who are also an omnivorous invertebrate) to represent this functional
group (lines 139-142). Hobson et al. 2002 – Deep Sea Research is also
cited where Themisto occupy a trophic position of 2.5 and have a similar
d15N to Gonatid squid (10‰ versus 11‰).
32. Line 154: 10th ? th should be superscript
RESPONSE: Changed (see line 155).
33. Lines 144-148: Did you take into consideration the effects of lipid-
extraction on d15N? Did you analyze d15N on lipid-extracted and non-lipid
extracted samples to assess the effects of lipid-extraction on d15N?
RESPONSE: We did not as the effect would be negligible given the
magnitude of change seen in our results. Lipid extraction has been shown
to affect d15N values but this seems to vary by taxa and lipid content of
the tissue. Following lipid extraction, d15N has been shown to increase by
0.1 and 0.2 for beluga whale and ringed seals muscle, respectively.
Marine mammal muscle is relatively ‘lean’ tissue. And this change is
within the measurement error for most stable isotope ratio mass
spectrometers. The influence of lipid extraction on d15N of fish muscle is
mixed with several studies reporting no significant change (Pinnegar &
Polunin – Functional Ecology; Ingram 2007 – L&O) while others have
reported higher increases (0.3-0.5‰ - Sotiropolous et al. 2004 – Ecol
Fresh Fish), an increase that would still be negligible given the magnitude
of changes observed in our results.
34. Lines 287-291: These two sentences are literally saying the same thing.
RESPONSE: Agreed – we have removed the second sentence previously
mentioning ecosystem stability.
35. Lines 325-328: The sentence is long and I would suggest rewriting and
avoiding repetitive words “….increasing sea temperatures [9], an increase in
the summer sea surface temperature…”
RESPONSE: We have modified sentence to reviewers’ suggestion – lines
313-316.
36. Line 341: Provide some examples of potential consequences on food web
structure.
RESPONSE: We have moved this sentence to lines 344-348 when briefly
discussing changing fish species composition on the functional
biogeography and spatial coupling of the system. We have now cited
Frainer et al. 2017 which details changes to certain functional traits of the
Barents Sea with implications on trophodynamics (see lines 348-351).
37. Line 377: I recommend rewriting “several near-apex predator” (see my
comment above)
RESPONSE: We disagree – see response to comment 22.
38. Figure 3: The different plots are not very clear (poor quality) and the y-
axis have different font/size (e.g., see (a) smaller than (b)).
RESPONSE: We have modified Figure 3 and all axes labels/fonts are of
similar size.
