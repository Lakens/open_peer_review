This study tested the efficacy of eDNA methods in running waters using a relatively small
stream-dwelling species, Odorrana splendida. The authors found the interesting results and the
results can be useful for further eDNA study and monitoring for aquatic vertebrates. However, I
have two major concerns on the technical issues.
1) I think that the MS lacks the descriptions of the sample preparations and qPCR methods. 1A)
The study used qPCR, so the MS should contain the essential information for the qPCR
experiment with regarding MIQE checklist (http://www.rdml.org/miqe.php). Particularly, the
information for standard curves (R2, PCR efficiency, the standard solution…) are totally missing.
1B) Also, my concern is for the PCR inhibitor effect on the results. In the discussion, the authors
suggested the authors possibly fail to amplify in the PCR assay. To test that, the DNA-spiking
experiment for the eDNA samples would be important for their conclusion. The authors can refer
a nice review paper of Goldburg et al. 2016 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-
210X.12595/full), which actually wrote by an author. 1C) Although this study used the primers
and probe from Takahara (unpublished data), the sequences of primers and probe should be
described because the published paper can be verified scientifically. Several minor comments on
the methods are described below.
3
2) Estimating the relationships between the eDNA flow and abundance/biomass was performed
using a type II model without any considering of the other potential models including
exponential function as well as the log and log linear (or type II) regressions. In fact, many studies
found that the exponential or log-log regression were significant for the eDNA-
biomass/abundance relationship. Also, for each site, the statistical power for type II regression is
very low with the small sample sizes (N=3, sometimes). I think the model for all sites would be
useful with plotting all sites with different colors or shapes. The results and discussions should
be revised along with the additional results.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
This manuscript uses eDNA methods to detect the presence and abundance of stream tadpoles.
No doubt this is a useful, timely, and potentially important application of eDNA technology. The
manuscript was reviewed by two experts, both of whom were enthusiastic about the work in
general. Nevertheless, both reviewers raise rather similar issues regarding the methods and
technical aspects of the work (in addition to several other important issues). I felt the reviews
were highly constructive and fair. Incorporating such comments would require a major revision.
Nevertheless, I am unsure if the authors have all the required information to furnish the details
requested by the expert reviewers. With much gratitude to the reviewers, I am recommending
reject/resubmit, and encourage the authors to resubmit if they feel confident they can adequately
address these comments. Finally, I urge the authors to clean up the manuscript (there are
numerous grammatical and typographical errors), and make the presentation clearer.
Editor Comments to the Author:
I agree with the AE's recommendation that the authors will benefit from the additional time
allowed with a "reject/resub" decision to see if they can marshal the evidence and arguments that
the reviewers suggest. Thanks for submitting.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have addressed all of the comments previously made, however, I have a couple of
clarifications and comments to make on this revised version of the text.
Personally, I do not think that validation of primers alone is really sufficient for a full paper any
more now that we are 10 years into eDNA analyses and I would not have separated this
information out of the paper into a separate submission as per your response to one of my
comments. Validation of assays is becoming more talked about in the field and to fully validate a
test certain conditions should be met, one of which being to include all the primer development
and in silico analyses etc. when reporting a study. I think as a field we have to be careful with the
term ‘fully validated’ as there are massively different levels of validation being reported in eDNA
papers.
Minor comments
Summary line 16: add what units are being used for ‘amount of O. splendida eDNA’ in
parenthesis
Introduction line 24: do you mean ‘unreliable’? otherwise ‘less reliable’ than what?
Introduction line 25: is 10 years still considered recent?
Introduction line 32: ‘Higher numbers of target species create…..’
Materials and methods line 11: where? In the stream?
Materials and methods line 35: delete ‘all the’ as you may have missed some
Materials and methods line 45: when was the filtering control done, prior to/ in between/after
samples?
Materials and methods line 61: ‘We used a primer/probe for….’
Materials and methods PCR section line 4: did you consider testing co-occurring species, this
should really be done too.
Materials and methods PCR section line 13: you should use MIQE guidelines as a checklist when
writing papers to make sure that you have included all the necessary information for another lab
to perform the same experiments, it is not as stated ‘The real-time PCR was performed according
to MIQE’, please delete. It is difficult to review a paper when a lot of this information is missing
as it is within another paper which is as yet unpublished, hence my dislike of separating the two
when developing a new test.
Results line 36: do you mean ‘up to 43 tadpoles per site….’?, and ‘up to 54.3g….’ and ‘upstream of
each sampling site…..’ At the moment you sound as though you are talking about only one of the
sites.
Discussion line 54: it is good to have included inhibition testing but there is no mention of how
you did this in the materials and methods, this will need to be added in.
Discussion line 56: not sure that ‘peels away’ is the best terms for this I would just say ‘Therefore,
it is more likely that we failed to collect eDNA in water samples as eDNA is unlikely to be
distributed evenly in the stream’ and just delete everything else up to ‘Further studies….’ Which
should be retained.
Discussion line 20 (last page): I think that you also need to add in that you could consider
filtering samples on site with single use filters as this would mean that you would not need to
carry litres of heavy water back with you but just the sampling equipment itself.

Appendix A
Comments to the Author
The use of eDNA to investigate the stream-dwelling species Odorrana splendida is
novel. However, I believe the current submission is not sufficient to validate the
process as I think that this study requires additional data analyses. Specifically, an
analysis of detection probability can be used to quantify the effectiveness of
different approaches (survey vs eDNA). See e.g. Sewell et al. 2010. Optimising
biodiversity assessments by volunteers: The application of occupancy modelling to
large-scale amphibian surveys. Biol. Conserv. 143, 2102-2110 for an application to
UK amphibian monitoring, and Schmidt et al. 2013. Site occupancy models in the
analysis of environmental DNA presence/absence surveys: a case study of an
emerging amphibian pathogen. Methods in Ecology and Evolution 4, 646-653 for an
application to eDNA studies.
Other comments:
Summary:
I think you need to change the 2nd sentence as you go on in the introduction to say
that studies have been done in lotic systems, perhaps remove ‘in lentic systems’.
Also ‘the amount of eDNA in the waster’, is this total eDNA or species-specific
eDNA?
Introduction:
I do not agree with the statement in paragraph 1 that ‘detection of eDNA from small
organisms in flowing water is more difficult as the amount of eDNA is small’ I think it
would be better to say that ‘detection of eDNA from organisms is more difficult in
flowing water due to dilution and dispersion by dynamic hydrological processes’
otherwise it sounds like you are saying that small organisms only release small
amounts of eDNA which is not necessarily the case.
End of paragraph 2: I think that there is a need for more studies in general in flowing
systems not just those focusing on small animals, I don’t really think that you can
make a big deal of the fact that ‘small animals’ have not been studied as you are
trying to do in this paper so I think remove all references to ‘small or large’
organisms. Also you keep on insisting that this species is small but have not as yet
given an average size range which would be useful.
Paragraph 3: I do not like the use of ‘true-positive rate’, just because you did not
observe animals at one eDNA positive site does not mean that the eDNA result was
wrong. Just call it the ‘eDNA detection rate’?
Materials and Methods:
Study Species:
information on size here? It reads as a list of statements rather than flowing
together, revisit this please. The ‘estimated density around the breeding site’, is this
an average of all 7 sites as at the moment it sounds like the density in one site.
Field survey: If there are 10 sites, why were samples not collected from all 10 sites
at each time point, this seems a very odd way to carry out your sampling and is a bit
of a flaw to be honest.
I would move the line ‘To account for…….for each subsection’ to after the sentences
‘In 2017……sampling sites’.
Why were samples not immediately filtered upon return to the laboratory?
Did you not use a combination of the scale and pixels to calculate SVL and body
size?
Real-time quantitative PCR:
The sequences of the primers and probe should be stated within the section, please
see Bustin et al (2009) MIQE Guidelines. Saying ‘unpublished data’ is not good
enough. Also no information about how primers were designed should probably
have a separate section on primer design and validation.
More information on the sodium hypochlorite treatment required: concentration
used, how long soaked for, how rinsed etc.
Why were the filters then frozen, 2 lots of freeze-thaw is not ideal.
The method of DNA extraction stops suddenly at ‘tubes were centrifuged again at
5000 g for 5 minutes’ you need to add a sentence to say that the DNeasy kit was
then used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to further clean and purify
the DNA. Also why was the standard elution volume (200µL) not used.
Should read ‘1µL of O. splendida primer/probe mix’
I would start a new paragraph at ‘Environmental DNA was quantified……’.
I think more information on primer validation is also required in this section.
How is copy number calculated there is no explanation of standard curves etc. or
what was used as a positive control for the PCRs.
I’d also add whether or not you followed a unidirectional lab flow?
What were the results for the cooler blanks, you put the negative control results in
this section, but need to state these too.
Statistical analysis:
Again do not like the use of ‘true-positive’.
Here is where your occupancy modelling should go.
You need a reference for biomass estimation from SVL and what is the ‘3’ referring
to?
‘stream site and whole sites combined’ – do you mean all sites combined, if so
change this.
Discussion:
I would state the reported detection rates as a range and then add references in
parenthesis. Also in lentic systems in the UK, great crested newt populations have
been studied and do not get 100% detection rates, so you need to consider adding a
range for lentic systems too.
‘Moreover, smaller biomass could cause lower detection rates’ – the giant
salamander example says ‘low density’ which does not necessarily mean smaller
biomass, I would amend this text so that your meaning is clear.
In paragraph 2 you discuss ‘false-negatives’, I think you also need to add discussion
on the eDNA positive where no O. splendida were observed and an explanation for
this as the eDNA results is not necessarily incorrect. Also the 20 individuals could
have been shedding more DNA for some reason as compared to the 30 which could
explain why they were detected and the 30 were not. I think you need to add some
text in to consider this.
In paragraph 3 you suggest that stream substrate could explain the different
relationships between tadpole abundance and eDNA among the stream sites
however you have not included any information on this so I assume that this was
not investigated so I think that you need to say so here.
Again in paragraph 3, if existing literature (Pilliod) collected more samples per site,
one has to ask the question why did you not do this too?
In paragraph 4 you say that eDNA can detect small organisms with high probability,
however, you have not done any analysis on probability, you mean detection rates.
Also remove the reference to small organisms.
Table 1: It would be useful to add a table with the eDNA score out of 8 into the
supplemental results, as if the not observed positive is only 1/8 its less likely to
really be positive than if it is e.g. 5/12 and vice versa for all other samples too.
Figure 4: typo? ‘snout-vent-length3’
Ethics statement: there is no ethics statement, one should be added as you are
catching organisms unless it is dealt with elsewhere during the submission process.

Comments to the Author:
This manuscript uses eDNA methods to detect the presence and abundance of
stream tadpoles. No doubt this is a useful, timely, and potentially important
application of eDNA technology. The manuscript was reviewed by two experts,
both of whom were enthusiastic about the work in general. Nevertheless, both
reviewers raise rather similar issues regarding the methods and technical aspects
of the work (in addition to several other important issues). I felt the reviews were
highly constructive and fair. Incorporating such comments would require a major
revision. Nevertheless, I am unsure if the authors have all the required information
to furnish the details requested by the expert reviewers. With much gratitude to
the reviewers, I am recommending reject/resubmit, and encourage the authors to
resubmit if they feel confident they can adequately address these comments.
Finally, I urge the authors to clean up the manuscript (there are numerous
grammatical and typographical errors), and make the presentation clearer.
--- Thank you for your positive comments to our manuscript. We thoroughly
revised it following the reviewers’ comments, including additional DNA-
spiking experiment that was suggested by reviewer 2. Please see our responses
to the reviewers.

Reviewer 1
Comments to the Author
The use of eDNA to investigate the stream-dwelling species Odorrana splendida is
novel. However, I believe the current submission is not sufficient to validate the
process as I think that this study requires additional data analyses. Specifically, an
analysis of detection probability can be used to quantify the effectiveness of
different approaches (survey vs eDNA). See e.g. Sewell et al. 2010. Optimising
biodiversity assessments by volunteers: The application of occupancy modelling to
largescale amphibian surveys. Biol. Conserv. 143, 2102-2110 for an application to
UK amphibian monitoring, and Schmidt et al. 2013. Site occupancy models in the
analysis of environmental DNA presence/absence surveys: a case study of an
emerging amphibian pathogen. Methods in Ecology and Evolution 4, 646-653 for
an application to eDNA studies.
--- Thank you for the suggestion. However, our aim was not in examining
detection probability in presence/absence survey. All the stream sites we
surveyed was with known distribution of O. splendida, that is, presence. We
admit that this explanation was not enough in previous version, so added it to
the text.
Other comments:
Summary:
I think you need to change the 2nd sentence as you go on in the introduction to say
that studies have been done in lotic systems, perhaps remove ‘in lentic systems’.
Also ‘the amount of eDNA in the water’, is this total eDNA or species-specific
eDNA?
--- The 2nd sentence was changed to “However, the efficacy of this method has
not been fully validated in lotic systems.”
--- “the amount of eDNA in the water” was changed to “the amount of O.
splendida eDNA in the water”.
Introduction:
I do not agree with the statement in paragraph 1 that ‘detection of eDNA from
small organisms in flowing water is more difficult as the amount of eDNA is small’
I think it would be better to say that ‘detection of eDNA from organisms is more
difficult in flowing water due to dilution and dispersion by dynamic hydrological
2
processes’ otherwise it sounds like you are saying that small organisms only release
small amounts of eDNA which is not necessarily the case.
--- Thank you for the comment. We changed the sentence as suggested.
End of paragraph 2: I think that there is a need for more studies in general in
flowing systems not just those focusing on small animals, I don’t really think that
you can make a big deal of the fact that ‘small animals’ have not been studied as
you are trying to do in this paper so I think remove all references to ‘small or
large’ organisms. Also you keep on insisting that this species is small but have not
as yet given an average size range which would be useful.
--- We admit that the effect of size was actually not examined and thus we
deleted the expressions on “small size” from the text. The wet weight of the
tadpole was added to Study species section (P2L5-6).
Paragraph 3: I do not like the use of ‘true-positive rate’, just because you did not
observe animals at one eDNA positive site does not mean that the eDNA result was
wrong. Just call it the ‘eDNA detection rate’?
--- We understand that either visual counting or eDNA methods do not have
100% detection. Although negative by visual counting can be false, positive by
visual counting is truly positive. Therefore, if eDNA is negative at the sites
visually positive, it is true-false, and if eDNA is positive there, it is true-
positive. This is why we used “true-positive” for detection rate.
Following your suggestion, we decided to use just “detection rate” for
the rate of positive results out of all the surveys (all are expected to be positive
because tadpoles are always there). We re-calculated detection rate and showed
79.2% for eDNA and 92.5% for visual method. These are all added to the text.
Materials and Methods:
Study Species:
information on size here? It reads as a list of statements rather than flowing
together, revisit this please. The ‘estimated density around the breeding site’, is
this an average of all 7 sites as at the moment it sounds like the density in one site.
--- Wet weight of the tadpole was added (P2L5-6).
--- The paragraph was revised to flow together.
--- The estimated density was from another study. To clear this, the sentence
was changed to “the estimated density…has been reported to be 266.5”.
3
Field survey: If there are 10 sites, why were samples not collected from all 10 sites
at each time point, this seems a very odd way to carry out your sampling and is a
bit of a flaw to be honest.
--- Due to the time constraints and loss of access to some sites after heavy rain,
not all the sites were surveyed every time. This was added to the text (P2L15-
16). We could use only the sites surveyed every time, but it would lose most of
the data, which we thought was a great loss of information.
I would move the line ‘To account for…….for each subsection’ to after the
sentences ‘In 2017……sampling sites’.
--- The sentence was moved to the end of the paragraph.
Why were samples not immediately filtered upon return to the laboratory?
--- The field station was far from the laboratory, and we did not have enough
equipment there for filtering without contamination. Therefore, the samples
transported to field station were frozen there and were then sent to laboratory
when the survey finished. We used the term “laboratory” for field station,
which made confusion. The sentence is now changed to “…placed into
individual plastic bags and transported to the field station with refrigerant and
stored in a freezer until filtering in the laboratory”.
Did you not use a combination of the scale and pixels to calculate SVL and body
size?
--- Yes we did use. “using the pixels on each photograph” is changed to “using
the scale and pixels on each photograph”. Sorry for the confusion.
Real-time quantitative PCR:
The sequences of the primers and probe should be stated within the section, please
see Bustin et al (2009) MIQE Guidelines. Saying ‘unpublished data’ is not good
enough. Also no information about how primers were designed should probably
have a separate section on primer design and validation.
--- We are publishing other paper where we describe primers and probe of
Odorrana splendida. The paper is under review at the moment and will be cited
in this MS once it is accepted. We added sequences of primer and probe in P2
L55-57.
4
More information on the sodium hypochlorite treatment required: concentration
used, how long soaked for, how rinsed etc.
--- We added the information in P2L38-39.
Why were the filters then frozen, 2 lots of freeze-thaw is not ideal.
--- Because we had limited space in freezer, we had to filter samples before all
the samples were ready for DNA extraction. Other studies froze samples before
(Deiner and Altermatt 2014, Plos one; Thomsen et al. 2012, Mol Ecol) or after
(Baldigo et al. 2017, Trans Ame Fisher Soc; Doi et al. 2017, Freshwat Biol)
filtering, and some did two lots of freeze (Takahara et al. 2013, Plos one).
Freezing at each stage has been confirmed to have little effect on results (Lear
et al. 2018, New Zealand J Ecol). Thus, we believe two lots of freeze did not
have serious deleterious effects on our results, especially when comparing
among sites and seasons by using the same method.
The method of DNA extraction stops suddenly at ‘tubes were centrifuged again at
5000 g for 5 minutes’ you need to add a sentence to say that the DNeasy kit was
then used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to further clean and purify
the DNA.
--- We added sentences to describe clean and purification steps of the DNA in
P2L46-51.
Also why was the standard elution volume (200µL) not used.
--- The concentration of eDNA from this targeted species was thought to be
very low, because the density is low in the fields. Thus, we thought that it was
necessary to concentrate the final elution DNA volume (i.e., 100µL). This
method is used in other studies as well (e.g. Deiner and Altermatt 2013, Plos
one; Laramie et al. 2015, Biol Conserv), and should be no problem.
Should read ‘1µL of O. splendida primer/probe mix’
--- Changed as suggested.
I would start a new paragraph at ‘Environmental DNA was quantified……’.
--- Changed as suggested.
5
I think more information on primer validation is also required in this section.
--- As we mentioned above, we are publishing another paper reporting this
primer probe and will cite it once accepted. For this MS, we added sequences
in P2L55-57.
How is copy number calculated there is no explanation of standard curves etc. or
what was used as a positive control for the PCRs.
--- Explanations of standard curve and positive controls are now added to the
text in P2L61-63, P3L1-3.
I’d also add whether or not you followed a unidirectional lab flow?
--- Explanations of unidirectional lab flow is added to the text in P3L4-6.
What were the results for the cooler blanks, you put the negative control results in
this section, but need to state these too.
--- Results for controls are now stated at the beginning of the Results section.
Statistical analysis:
Again do not like the use of ‘true-positive’.
--- We deleted true-positive and used detection rate as mentioned above.
Here is where your occupancy modelling should go.
--- Thank you for your suggestion, but as we responded above, occupancy
modelling does not fit in the aim of this study.
You need a reference for biomass estimation from SVL and what is the ‘3’
referring to?
--- “SVL3” was cubic of SVL, and “3” was rough estimation of the relationship
between biomass and SVL. In order to obtain more accurate relationship, we
measured biomass and SVL of 468 tadpoles in the field. Using the obtained
equation, all the data were re-analyzed with the estimated biomass. This was
added to the text.
‘stream site and whole sites combined’ – do you mean all sites combined, if so
change this.
--- Following the other reviewer, the analysis is now done only for all the sites
6
combined. The sentence was changed according to it.
Discussion:
I would state the reported detection rates as a range and then add references in
parenthesis. Also in lentic systems in the UK, great crested newt populations have
been studied and do not get 100% detection rates, so you need to consider adding a
range for lentic systems too.
--- Biggs et al. (2015) showed 99.3% detection rate in eDNA survey on Great
Crested newt. This is added to the text and the references are shown in
parenthesis.
‘Moreover, smaller biomass could cause lower detection rates’ – the giant
salamander example says ‘low density’ which does not necessarily mean smaller
biomass, I would amend this text so that your meaning is clear.
--- We agree that the smaller animals do not necessarily release smaller
amounts of eDNA. Therefore, these sentences were deleted.
In paragraph 2 you discuss ‘false-negatives’, I think you also need to add
discussion on the eDNA positive where no O. splendida were observed and an
explanation for this as the eDNA results is not necessarily incorrect.
--- Our survey sites are all positive sites, and thus, if the method fails to detect
tadpole, it means false-negative. We did not visually observe tadpoles in some
surveys, which is of course false-negatives of the visual survey. We now
clearly mention that the sites should be all positive. We did not discuss on
false-negatives of the visual survey because we choose survey sites by visual
survey, and thus it may have already biased toward higher detection by visual
survey.
Also the 20 individuals could have been shedding more DNA for some reason as
compared to the 30 which could explain why they were detected and the 30 were
not. I think you need to add some text in to consider this.
--- We agree. The sentence was deleted.
In paragraph 3 you suggest that stream substrate could explain the different
relationships between tadpole abundance and eDNA among the stream sites
however you have not included any information on this so I assume that this was
7
not investigated so I think that you need to say so here.
--- Following this suggestion, we added “However, stream substrates of the
survey sites were rocky with small amount of sands and did not seem to be
highly different among sites” to the text.
Again in paragraph 3, if existing literature (Pilliod) collected more samples per
site, one has to ask the question why did you not do this too?
--- Because our survey sites located deep in steep mountains and we walked
along streams with collected samples for several sites, it was not easy to collect
more than 1 L at each site. The volume of each water sample in previous
studies ranges from 15 mL to more than 5 L, with most common amount of 1-2
L (Evans and Lamberti 2018, Fish Res). Thus, we believed 1 L of sampling
was reasonable. However, now that we show 1 L may not be enough, our study
is important to raise an alarm for small volume of water samples. We added
these explanations to the text (P4L2-7).
In paragraph 4 you say that eDNA can detect small organisms with high
probability, however, you have not done any analysis on probability, you mean
detection rates. Also remove the reference to small organisms.
--- We changed the sentence only to say that the detection rate was around
80%, and deleted the reference to small organisms.
Table 1: It would be useful to add a table with the eDNA score out of 8 into the
supplemental results, as if the not observed positive is only 1/8 its less likely to
really be positive than if it is e.g. 5/12 and vice versa for all other samples too.
--- We added the data to Table 1.
Figure 4: typo? ‘snout-vent-length3’
--- SVL3 was deleted and the description is changed to “the total of estimated
biomass of Odorrana splendida tadpoles”.
Ethics statement: there is no ethics statement, one should be added as you are
catching organisms unless it is dealt with elsewhere during the submission process.
--- Ethical Statement is shown in “Ethical statement” section.

Comments to the Author(s)
This study tested the efficacy of eDNA methods in running waters using a
relatively small stream-dwelling species, Odorrana splendida. The authors found
the interesting results and the results can be useful for further eDNA study and
monitoring for aquatic vertebrates. However, I have two major concerns on the
technical issues.
1) I think that the MS lacks the descriptions of the sample preparations and qPCR
methods. 1A) The study used qPCR, so the MS should contain the essential
information for the qPCR experiment with regarding MIQE checklist
(http://www.rdml.org/miqe.php). Particularly, the information for standard curves
(R2, PCR efficiency, the standard solution…) are totally missing. 1B) Also, my
concern is for the PCR inhibitor effect on the results. In the discussion, the authors
suggested the authors possibly fail to amplify in the PCR assay. To test that, the
DNA-spiking experiment for the eDNA samples would be important for their
conclusion. The authors can refer a nice review paper of Goldburg et al. 2016
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12595/full), which actually
wrote by an author. 1C) Although this study used the primers and probe from
Takahara (unpublished data), the sequences of primers and probe should be
described because the published paper can be verified scientifically. Several minor
comments on the methods are described below.
<U+F0E8> 1A) We added details of the method.
<U+F0E8> 1B) Following your suggestion, we performed the DNA-spiking experiment. As a
result, the PCR inhibitor effect was not detected in the four samples with negative
eDNA results. We added this to the Discussion section where we discussed the
possibility of failing to amplify the eDNA (P3L43-45).
<U+F0E8> 1C: We are publishing another paper where we describe primers and probe of
Odorrana splendida. The paper is under review at the moment and will be cited in
this MS once it is accepted. We added sequences of the primer and probe to the text
(P2L55-57).
9
2) Estimating the relationships between the eDNA flow and abundance/biomass
was performed using a type II model without any considering of the other potential
models including exponential function as well as the log and log linear (or type II)
regressions. In fact, many studies found that the exponential or log-log regression
were significant for the eDNA-biomass/abundance relationship. Also, for each site,
the statistical power for type II regression is very low with the small sample sizes
(N=3, sometimes). I think the model for all sites would be useful with plotting all
sites with different colors or shapes. The results and discussions should be revised
along with the additional results.
--- Because our aim was to see whether eDNA amount reflected the abundance
or biomass of tadpoles, we determined the type of model a priori. Many other
studies with the same aim did also have one model a priori [6,8,10]. We chose
type II regression because both eDNA concentration and the abundance or
biomass of tadpoles had variations. It is true that we should have considered
logarithmic relationship, thus we followed other studies [6,9] and log-
transformed the eDNA amount. The results then showed that both abundance
and biomass had significantly positive relationships with eDNA amount.
Method and Results were changed according to it.
--- Following the suggestion, figure 3 and 4 are now shown as one figure for
the all streams combined with different shapes of plots for each stream.
Regression analysis was conducted for the all streams combined as well.
Methods, Results, and Discussion were changed accordingly.
Minor comments

--- We added the size data in Study species section. Following the other
reviewer’s comments, we deleted the references on the smallness of our target
species.

—> • GF/F, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
--- Corrected.

L31 Sodium hypochlorite treatment
-> What is the concentration? How long did you?
--- We added the concentration and soak time in P2L38-39.
There are not any filtering controls with DNA-free water?
--- There were filtering controls in 2015. We added this information in the text
in P2L39-40.
L37 were centrifuged again at 5000 g for 5 min.
—>after the sentence, please add the purification step using DNeasy kit.
--- We added sentences explaining purification step in P2L46-51.
L39 • 1 µL of O. splendida primer probe
-> Should describe the concentrations (e.g., ** nM)
--- We added concentrations of the primers and the probe as “1 µL of O.
splendida primer (900 nM)/probe (125 nM) mix”.
• 2 µL of DNA solution
-> 2 µL of sample DNA solution. or 2 µL of DNA template
--- Because we used the 2 µL of eDNA extract, we changed “DNA solution” to
“eDNA extract”.
L41 2 min at 50 °C
-> The step is usually for UNG (Uracil-N-glycosylase) preparation. The PCR
templates may not contain the solution.
--- We agree with your comment. Although we did not add UNG, this step is
default in our qPCR system and running the program is no problem.
L44 8 wells that contained no template
-> with 2µL of DNA-free water?
--- Yes, with 2µL of DNA-free water. We added this to the text. Thank you.
There was no amplification from any of these negative controls.
-> DID these negative controls include cooler and other blanks?
--- Yes. We checked the cooler blanks and filtering blank. We now state
“Positive results were not obtained for any of the control samples (i.e., cooler
11
blanks, filtering controls, NTC); therefore, contamination was unlikely” at the
beginning of the Results section.
L54 • type II regressions
-> What method is for the type II regression?
--- “with the standard major axis method” was added.
L55
The biomass of tadpoles was estimated as the sum of SVL3
-> This equation looks very rough for the biomass calculation. Please cite any
references using the equation to estimate the tadpole biomass.
--- The estimation equation is now obtained from 468 tadpoles in other study
and all the biomass data was re-calculated. The equation was added to the text
and the results were changed according to the new data.
P3
L30
The reason for this negative result may be that we did not catch floating eDNA in
stream water, or we collected existing eDNA but it failed to amplify in the PCR
assay.
—> Please see the above major comment.
--- Following your suggestion, we performed the DNA-spiking experiment. As
a result, the PCR inhibitor effect was not detected in the eDNA-negative
samples (N=4). We added this to the Discussion section.
Fig.2 The order of the open and filled points in each month may be complicated.
For instance, in Dec of C2, open->filled, but in Dec of C4, the order was opposite.
--- The circles were allocated according to the date of sampling, not to the
month, and that is why this happened. We added the explanation to the caption
of Fig.2.
Fig.4 upper and lower 95% CI
—> of what? upper and lower 95% CI of slope?
--- The sentence was changed to “with upper and lower limits of the 95% CI
for the slope and elevation of the regression”.

Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed all of the comments previously made, however, I have a
couple of clarifications and comments to make on this revised version of the text.
Personally, I do not think that validation of primers alone is really sufficient for a
full paper any more now that we are 10 years into eDNA analyses and I would not
have separated this information out of the paper into a separate submission as per
your response to one of my comments. Validation of assays is becoming more talked
about in the field and to fully validate a test certain conditions should be met, one of
which being to include all the primer development and in silico analyses etc. when
reporting a study. I think as a field we have to be careful with the term ‘fully
validated’ as there are massively different levels of validation being reported in
eDNA papers.
--- The validation of primers is not being published as a full paper by itself. We
are publishing another research paper and the primer validation is included as
methodology there. We understand that the paper with primer validation should
be published first, but the order of reviewing step and acceptance cannot be
controlled by authors. We appreciate if Editor and Reviewers understand the
situation and allow us to cite the paper as (under review).
--- “fully” is deleted.

Summary line 16: add what units are being used for ‘amount of O. splendida eDNA’
in parenthesis
--- (copies/s) is added.
Introduction line 24: do you mean ‘unreliable’? otherwise ‘less reliable’ than what?
--- changed to “unreliable”.
Introduction line 25: is 10 years still considered recent?
--- “relatively” is added.
Introduction line 32: ‘Higher numbers of target species create…..’
--- changed as suggested.
Materials and methods line 11: where? In the stream?
--- yes. “in the stream” is added.
Materials and methods line 35: delete ‘all the’ as you may have missed some
--- “all the” is deleted.
Materials and methods line 45: when was the filtering control done, prior to/ in
between/after samples?
--- It was after samples. “as a last sample” is added to the text.
Materials and methods line 61: ‘We used a primer/probe for….’
--- changed as suggested.
Materials and methods PCR section line 4: did you consider testing co-occurring
species, this should really be done too.
---It was actually done and is included in the under-review. This is shown in
P2L58-60.
Materials and methods PCR section line 13: you should use MIQE guidelines as a
checklist when writing papers to make sure that you have included all the necessary
information for another lab to perform the same experiments, it is not as stated ‘The
real-time PCR was performed according to MIQE’, please delete. It is difficult to
review a paper when a lot of this information is missing as it is within another paper
which is as yet unpublished, hence my dislike of separating the two when developing
a new test.
---We deleted the sentence.
Results line 36: do you mean ‘up to 43 tadpoles per site….’?, and ‘up to 54.3g….’
and ‘upstream of each sampling site…..’ At the moment you sound as though you
are talking about only one of the sites.
--- “per site” is added to each.
Discussion line 54: it is good to have included inhibition testing but there is no
mention of how you did this in the materials and methods, this will need to be added
in.
--- “to test for inhibition in the eDNA samples, we performed a spike experiment
using the number of known target DNA copies (1.0 × 10^3 copies) with a
plasmid containing the cytochrome b gene of Hypomesus nipponensis (a fish not
inhabits in our study area) and the primer-probe set from Takahara et al.
(unpublished data)” is added to P3L45-48.
Discussion line 56: not sure that ‘peels away’ is the best terms for this I would just
say ‘Therefore, it is more likely that we failed to collect eDNA in water samples as
eDNA is unlikely to be distributed evenly in the stream’ and just delete everything
else up to ‘Further studies….’ Which should be retained.
--- The sentence is changed as suggested.
Discussion line 20 (last page): I think that you also need to add in that you could
consider filtering samples on site with single use filters as this would mean that you
would not need to carry litres of heavy water back with you but just the sampling
equipment itself.
--- “Alternatively, we could consider filtering water samples on site with single
use filters” is added to P4L11-12.
