GENERAL COMMENTS:
The manuscript entitled ‘Long seed dispersal distances by an inquisitive flightless rail (Gallirallus
australis) are reduced by interaction with humans’ is an original work through which authors
combine GPS data and gut retention time to estimate seed dispersal distances provided by the
New Zealand weka, and evaluate the impact that a strong contact with humans can have on this
service. The study has involved a major field effort. It provides interesting results on cryptic
function loss and opens debate on conservation strategies.
The manuscript is clearly written, easy to follow and concise. However, I have some comments
that I hope they help to improve the manuscript.
-ABSTRACT:
l 38-40: I think that reporting the number of individuals analysed is not relevant in the abstract.
Maybe you could rewrite this part of the abstract: ‘However, we found evidence of a significant
human impact on the seed dispersal distances of weka, birds occupying areas of high human use
showing 34.8-40.9% shorter distances that their more remote counterparts’.
- KEYWORDS: I suggest replacing ‘habitat change’ by ‘habitat use’, which I think fits better to the
studied situation in which structural anthropogenic modifications of the landscape are not
described.
- INTRODUCTION:
l. 54: add a comma after ‘noise’
l. 61-64: your focal seed disperser species is a bird, so why don’t you change this example by
highlighting what has been reported in birds (ref. 6)?
l. 71. This is a very general statement about seed dispersal consequences, so I think that ref. 9 is
not necessary here (it refers to a certain plant species). But if want to keep it, it should be
necessary to fix it in the reference list (author names are not correctly written and two of them are
repeated).
l. 96. I suggest adding the authorship of the species the first time you mention it in the
manuscript. The same for other taxa.
l. 104. Carpenter 2018 unpubl. data: Why don’t you include these data on gut retention time as
part of this study?
l. 110. …to study weka seed dispersal distances.
METHODS
l. 124. birds (plural)
l. 130-138: Any reference supporting these descriptions of the plant species?
l. 139 onwards: The study has an important spatial component, so It would be nice to see a figure
with a map showing the three sites studied and the area occupied by the campsites at the
Mahinapua and Goldsborough Reserves. Besides, the current manuscript has only one figure, so
maybe a first figure showing graphically the experimental design could be part of the body of the
ms.
l. 166. Justify why the device shouldn't be heavier than 5% of the bird’s body mass and add a
3
reference (e.g. Geen et al 2019. Effects of tracking devices on individual birds – a review of the
evidence. Journal of Avian Biology, e01823)
l. 167. Why 14 days of monitoring? I guess because of the lifespan of the GPS batteries, but justify
why.
l. 170. Were these three birds those from Mahinapua Reserve?
l. 173. Report n of males and females, and n of juvenile and adults.
l. 175. Report the % of GPS fixes excluded.
l. 183 onwards (Mechanistic model). As required by the journal: “Datasets, code, and other digital
materials should be deposited in an appropriate, recognised, publicly available repository”.
Therefore I recommend you to make the R-code for the Mechanistic model available as
supporting information.
l. 189. As pointed above, I think that this study focused on the estimation of seed dispersal
distances by combining GPS data and information about gut retention time could be the place
where properly report the data you have on seed retention time.
l. 196. Delete ‘only’
l. 218-225. It is not clear from the text if n=10 camp followers includes the juveniles or not,
because they are also camp followers according to their home range. Rewrite this part in order to
clarify that juvenile birds are n=5 and the final analysis was performed with 21 adult birds.
l. 235. You included ‘site’ as a random effect in your linear mixed effect model. However, you are
only considering 2 sites, and the use of random factors with less than 5-6 levels is not
recommended. Crawley [p. 670: Crawley, M. J. 2002. Statistical Computing: An Introduction to
Data Analysis using S-PLUS] recommended treating variables as fixed factors when there aren’t
enough levels of a factor.
As published by Bolker et al. in the following blog:
http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#should-i-treat-factor-xxx-as-fixed-
or-random
Are there enough levels of the factor in the data on which to base an estimate of the variance of
the population of effects? No, means [you should probably treat the variable as] fixed effects.
- RESULTS
l. 243. This info (< 7%) is redundant. You already said that 93-96% of the seeds are dispersed
away from the parent tree.
l. 253. Cite Table 2 instead of Table 1.
DISCUSSION
l. 268 You cite an important study on spatial patterns of seed dispersal, but I miss here other
important and more recent studies reporting seed dispersal kernels by birds of different sizes to
which it would be interesting compare and discuss your dispersal kernel:
e.g.
Jordano et al. 2007. Differential contribution of frugivores to complex seed dispersal patterns.
PNAS, 104
González-Varo et al. 2017. Unravelling seed dispersal through fragmented landscapes: Frugivore
species operate unevenly as mobile links. Molecular Ecology, DOI: 10.1111/mec.14181
l. 272. I would be more careful when talking about effectiveness in seed dispersal (also in l. 345),
since it involves many other drivers besides seed dispersal distance. I think that your results are
very important for the qualitative component of the seed dispersal effectiveness. I also but think
that you can talk about effectiveness when discussing your results together with previous
information on the quantitative component of seed dispersal.
l. 284-286. But are these other frugivores capable of dispersing the seeds of the large-fruited
Hinau and Miro? Please, rewrite to clarify that weka and these other frugivores overlap in their
4
fruit diet so they could provide complementary seed dispersal services.
l. 292. Do you know if juveniles perform dispersal movements in a certain time of the year? If so,
could these movements involve long distance dispersal events for certain plant species with
overlapping fruit phenologies? (This is just a question that rises to me when reading this line).
l. 304-305. Not only on enhancing gene-flow but also for colonising new sites and tracking the
climatic envelope.
l. 317. Add references to support this.

Carpenter et al. explore the efficiency of flightless birds, in particular the New Zealand rail weka,
as seed dispersers, and further investigate the effects of increased exposure to human presence in
the landscape. Using GPS tracks from some 40 birds in three different sites combined with
mechanistic modeling of seed retention time, they find that while volant birds are usually
presumed more efficient seed dispersers, the flightless weka is a surprisingly efficient disperser
due to relatively large home ranges and unusually long seed retention time. However, wekas are
curious birds that are attracted to human activity, and the authors noticed reduced mobility
among rails in areas with human presence (e.g. campgrounds), leading to cryptic loss of
ecosystem services through reduced seed dispersal.
This is overall a neat and well-designed study that delivers both counterintuitive and important
results. I have unusually few remarks, but I do find one issue generally problematic: The
mechanistic model of seed retention is based on an unpublished dataset of seed retention times
by the main author (“Carpenter 2018 unpubl. data”), from which the statement also stems that
the weka has the longest seed retention time in the world. Since this is one of the two major
datasets that the present paper is based upon, I do not think it is acceptable to only refer to this as
an unpublished dataset (and not make it available). In the present paper, the probability
distributions of seed dispersal distances are presented, but as reader I am only presented with a
couple of descriptive statistics of the seed retention time. Perhaps this dataset is meant to be
published in a separate manuscript, but if that manuscript is not accepted, it renders the present
one premature. In order to avoid that, I would argue that the authors should include methods
and results for the collection of that dataset too in this manuscript. I also note that the authors
have answered “Yes” to the question whether new data is presented (true), and state that “All
data used in this paper are available as ESM 1”. The GPS logging dataset in ESM 1 is extensive
and well curated, but it only covers the tracking, and the latter statement is thus incorrect. Thus,
in order to adhere to RSOS standards, the seed retention data should make up ESM 2, and be
presented in the manuscript.
I don’t think that the opening statement is correct. The authors claim that “Humans have
modified approximately 50 to 70% of the earth’s surface” and refer to Barnosky et al. (2012)
Nature. However, I do not believe that these numbers are supported by Barnosky et al.
(especially look at terrestrial vs. marine parts of the Earth, and current vs. projected
transformation).
The authors consistently use “weka” as plural form. As far as I, as non-newzeelander,
understand, “wekas” would be the correct plural form of weka, although I also understand that
“weka” is sometimes used also as plural.
References 5, 24, 26, 38, 42 have missing or incorrect details or incorrect formatting.
As a very minor comment, I would advise the authors to present Figure 2 as boxplots rather than
a bar chart, given the type of data.
6
Apart from the treatment of seed retention data, all other comments are minor, and would render
an “Accept with minor revision”. In my opinion, if the availability and treatment of seed
retention data (preferably by inclusion in the manuscript and as supplement or data deposition),
this manuscript is in good shape and qualifies for publication in RSOS. However, as is, I therefore
recommend a “Major revision”.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The paper has clearly improved a lot after full disclosure of the retention time experiment.
However, I stand by my earlier comments which the authors have chosen to dismiss. In
particular in two sites, birds are compared between two groups, those associated with a camp site
and those not. In principle, there could be many reasons why there is a difference in movement
between birds using one part of a habitat and another. There are only two places where there is a
comparison made between camp and other. Hence it is perfectly possible that the results have a
different explanation, the real sample size of importance is N = 2 study sites, in both of which a
similar spatial pattern is recorded. Given this reality, and in the absence of other data I think the
conclusions need to be presented with some more caution.
In this new version I have the following specific comments:
There is a lack of clarity about what is meant by “quality of seed dispersal” e.g. in line 105 or 483.
If we compare the paper with Schupp et al. 2017, I do not see what component of quality (as
defined in that paper) is being studied herein. The effectiveness framework as presented says
very little about dispersal distance, unlike this rail paper. I suggest it is best to just talk of
dispersal distance rather than “quality”.
Line 113 Explain/spell out what RFID is.
132-134 A clear justification is required here for why you are modelling dispersal of these two
plant species, since you present no data on the consumption or abundance of these two plant
species in your study area. Ultimately it is because you have data from a captive experiment, but
this needs pointing out. And some idea of the distribution of these two plant species in the study
area should be given.
160-161 Discuss the possible consequences of removing the fleshy exocarp from miro seeds on the
results, especially retention time. You assume that removing pulp makes no difference, but what
studies in other organisms support such an assumption? Furthermore, the seeds were smeared
with cheese, might that not influence retention time? At least say why you think not.
433 “very long distance dispersal” seems a significant exaggeration to me for a flightless bird. I
would apply that term rather to birds that move a much greater distance of hundreds of km, e.g.
Viana et al.

I think that the authors have addressed all of the issues brought up by the reviewers in a
satisfactory manner, and improved the manuscript greatly. With the explicit inclusion of the seed
retention estimation, and the provision of that dataset, the manuscripts is now “complete” and
meets the open access standards of RSOS. With a minor edit (see below) I think that this study is
now suitable for publication.
After reading the revised manuscript, I only find one minor issue that could easily be addressed.
For some reason, in a single passage, only scientific names are used. I would strongly suggest that
in the final version of the manuscript, the common names are inserted for lines 395–397. The birds
are spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) and song thrush (Turdus philomelos), the trees wild olive
(Olea europaea var. sylvestris) and mahaleb cherry (Prunus mahaleb) [although the latter one
may also be known also under other common names].

Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The paper has clearly improved a lot after full disclosure of the retention time experiment.
However, I stand by my earlier comments which the authors have chosen to dismiss. In
particular in two sites, birds are compared between two groups, those associated with a camp site
and those not. In principle, there could be many reasons why there is a difference in movement
between birds using one part of a habitat and another. There are only two places where there is a
comparison made between camp and other. Hence it is perfectly possible that the results have a
different explanation, the real sample size of importance is N = 2 study sites, in both of which a
similar spatial pattern is recorded. Given this reality, and in the absence of other data I think the
conclusions need to be presented with some more caution.
In this new version I have the following specific comments:
There is a lack of clarity about what is meant by “quality of seed dispersal” e.g. in line 105 or 483.
If we compare the paper with Schupp et al. 2017, I do not see what component of quality (as
defined in that paper) is being studied herein. The effectiveness framework as presented says
very little about dispersal distance, unlike this rail paper. I suggest it is best to just talk of
dispersal distance rather than “quality”.
Line 113 Explain/spell out what RFID is.
132-134 A clear justification is required here for why you are modelling dispersal of these two
plant species, since you present no data on the consumption or abundance of these two plant
species in your study area. Ultimately it is because you have data from a captive experiment, but
this needs pointing out. And some idea of the distribution of these two plant species in the study
area should be given.
160-161 Discuss the possible consequences of removing the fleshy exocarp from miro seeds on the
results, especially retention time. You assume that removing pulp makes no difference, but what
studies in other organisms support such an assumption? Furthermore, the seeds were smeared
with cheese, might that not influence retention time? At least say why you think not.
433 “very long distance dispersal” seems a significant exaggeration to me for a flightless bird. I
would apply that term rather to birds that move a much greater distance of hundreds of km, e.g.
Viana et al.

Appendix A
This is a study of estimated seed dispersal distances by populations of a flightless rail in three
sites. From my understanding, adults and juveniles are tracked at three different sites. Then
seed dispersal was estimated only for adults, and only for two of the sites (those with some
adult birds using a campsite and other birds using other habitats). Seed dispersal is estimated
based on unpublished retention time data, and it seems that neither these data nor the
movement data per se are made available by the authors (Q: is that not against the policy of
this journal?).
There seems to be no use of real data on true diet or the location or the timing of seed
ingestion data, so in that sense the seed dispersal distance estimates cannot be considered to
be reliable. Neither are there data presented that show that the rails disperse these plants at
these sites, although perhaps some such data are included in reference 21.
The reported effects seem believable and are somewhat equivalent to showing that ducks in
urban ponds, where people feed them bread, fly around less (and disperse seeds over shorter
distances) than ducks in natural wetlands. This is not very surprising, but there is only a weakly
significant effect and the statistical analyses do not seem to me to be robust, since there is
really only a sample size of two (i.e. the two locations where birds are compared with and
without a campsite). Furthermore, it may be that there is some other confounding variable,
e.g. the campsites are positioned in low-lying areas with more emergent vegetation that
provides more natural food (if these rails behave anything like Porphyrio).
I did not understand how the movement data from the third site was used, but it looks like the
same data from the other sites was used twice, first to construct a dispersal kernel, then to use
that kernel to predict seed movement. This strikes me as an important source of error on the
distance estimates that needs to be recognized by the authors, and perhaps means that the
dispersal estimates for different individual birds are not at all independent. In any case,
movements of birds living together cannot strictly speaking be considered as independent (as
they are in your statistical models), as they will obviously influence each other e.g. through
antagonistic behaviour or conspecific attraction.
I think the paper would be much stronger if it focused more on the movement data and
included the third site (no campsite) data and the juvenile data, making a clear comparison in
movement patterns between them all. The seed dispersal estimates are rough approximations
(for the reasons given above), and should be a secondary part of the paper. In my opinion,
they are not strong enough to make a stand alone paper in a high quality journal. Perhaps
there is some plant to split the data into different papers, but that can be counterproductive.
Another thing of concern is the manner in which the paper is written as if seed dispersal only
occurs through frugivory, ignoring the important dispersal of other seeds by rallids through
granivory, e.g. see Bartel et al. 2018, Thorsen et al. 2009, Green et al. 2016. I was left
wondering what other plants are dispersed by these rails, e.g. given the importance of
Porphyrio as a vector for Eleocharis (Bell 2000).
MINOR COMMENTS
28 overstated, e.g. there are many papers about the influence of disturbance on waterfowl,
which are major seed vectors (e.g. papers by Madsen and Stillman)
62 “are reduced” should be “can be reduced” since this is not a universal finding
104 some explanation for extraordinary retention times should be offered, and these
unpublished data should be made available. These are not so extraordinary in the light of
Proctor 1968.
123 again this looks like the authors are ignoring the existence of seed dispersal by
herbivorous and granivorous birds e.g. by introduced black swans (Green et al. 2008).
153 Exactly how these data were used needs explaining somewhere.
272 overstated, you present no information about dispersal quality since there are no results
about how many virtual seeds would be deposited under the canopy of different trees, or in
more suitable microhabitats. Hence you have not demonstrated highly effective dispersal. For
that, you would at least need to present information on the estimated proportions of different
habitats to which seeds are moved, and some idea of the value of each for seedling
establishment.
333 in particular, it should be mentioned that dispersal can increase dispersal distances, e.g.
when waterbirds are regularly disturbed and forced to fly to different wetlands.
342-44 presumably you mean 26 fleshy fruited species, I bet they disperse even more species
that don’t have a fleshy fruit (including those with a dry fruit).
482 This reference 27 seems incomplete, and ref 26 also seems wrong. Grey literature that is
not available to a reader is best left uncited, or details of the important content provided in
supplementary material.

Dear Editor,
We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments and welcome the opportunity to resubmit
our revised manuscript. As suggested by the three reviewers, we have added the dataset, methods,
and results of the seed retention time experiment into this work, which has significantly
strengthened the paper. This makes the basis for our mechanistic model much clearer. We have also
made the other small changes suggested by reviewers, and have responded to their specific
comments below in green type.
Thank you for your consideration,
Dr. Jo Carpenter
Associate Editor's comments:
The reviewers of your paper are broadly positive towards it, though each indicate a number
of modifications are necessary before it may be considered for publication. Importantly, it
has been observed that only a portion of your data have been made available to reviewers
(and thus also to readers in the event the paper is published). In line with the journal's data
access policy, you should make the dataset(s), code, or other digital research materials
available at submission - we will not be able to accept the paper unless you can not only
respond effectively to the reviewers' concerns but also provide the additional (and currently
absent) data. Please contact the editorial office with any queries you may have before you
resubmit.

GENERAL COMMENTS:
The manuscript entitled ‘Long seed dispersal distances by an inquisitive flightless rail
(Gallirallus australis) are reduced by interaction with humans’ is an original work through
which authors combine GPS data and gut retention time to estimate seed dispersal
distances provided by the New Zealand weka, and evaluate the impact that a strong contact
with humans can have on this service. The study has involved a major field effort. It provides
interesting results on cryptic function loss and opens debate on conservation strategies.
The manuscript is clearly written, easy to follow and concise. However, I have some
comments that I hope they help to improve the manuscript.
Thank you for your helpful comments. This study did have a major field effort and we
appreciate the reviewer acknowledging that.
-ABSTRACT:
l 38-40: I think that reporting the number of individuals analysed is not relevant in the
abstract. Maybe you could rewrite this part of the abstract: ‘However, we found evidence of a
significant human impact on the seed dispersal distances of weka, birds occupying areas of
high human use showing 34.8-40.9% shorter distances that their more remote counterparts’.
We have made these changes as suggested. It now reads: “However, we found evidence of
a significant human impact on the seed dispersal distances of weka, with birds occupying
areas of high human use performing 34.8-40.9% shorter distances that their more remote
counterparts.” Lines 38-41.
- KEYWORDS: I suggest replacing ‘habitat change’ by ‘habitat use’, which I think fits better
to the studied situation in which structural anthropogenic modifications of the landscape are
not described.
Done.
- INTRODUCTION:
l. 54: add a comma after ‘noise’
We are actually referring to noise pollution specifically, not noise and pollution, so a comma
isn’t appropriate here.
l. 61-64: your focal seed disperser species is a bird, so why don’t you change this example
by highlighting what has been reported in birds (ref. 6)?
We searched for possible bird examples but thought that the cited mammal paper is more
relevant to this case.
l. 71. This is a very general statement about seed dispersal consequences, so I think that
ref. 9 is not necessary here (it refers to a certain plant species). But if want to keep it, it
should be necessary to fix it in the reference list (author names are not correctly written and
two of them are repeated).
We have removed ref 9 as suggested.
l. 96. I suggest adding the authorship of the species the first time you mention it in the
manuscript. The same for other taxa.
We have added the authorship for weka, it now reads “In New Zealand, one species that has
a high level of human interaction is the weka (Gallirallus australis; Sparrman, 1786), an
inquisitive flightless rail.” Line 96.
l. 104. Carpenter 2018 unpubl. data: Why don’t you include these data on gut retention time
as part of this study?
This is a good point. We originally were planning to publish the seed retention data
separately, but we agree with the reviewer that it should be part of this manuscript. We have
added the seed retention time methods and results to this paper, and have extended the
discussion to accommodate the new data.
l. 110. …to study weka seed dispersal distances.
Amended, the sentence now reads “We used a mechanistic model approach to study weka
seed dispersal distances.” Line 109.
METHODS
l. 124. birds (plural)
Corrected, thank you.
l. 130-138: Any reference supporting these descriptions of the plant species?
We have added a reference to support the plant species descriptions (The Flora of New
Zealand, Vol. 1).
“Miro is a tree that grows to 25 m tall and occurs throughout New Zealand. Its fruits are 12-
15 mm in diameter, with a fleshy exocarp and a hard, woody seedcoat 1.5-2 mm thick that
encases the single seed [27]. Hinau trees grow up to 20 m tall and occur in lowland conifer-
broadleaf forest throughout the North Island and the northern South Island. Its fruits average
9.2 mm diameter, with a carbohydrate-rich exocarp and mesocarp and a hard woody
seedcoat protecting the single seed [27].” Lines 134-140.
l. 139 onwards: The study has an important spatial component, so It would be nice to see a
figure with a map showing the three sites studied and the area occupied by the campsites at
the Mahinapua and Goldsborough Reserves. Besides, the current manuscript has only one
figure, so maybe a first figure showing graphically the experimental design could be part of
the body of the ms.
We have added a map showing the location of the three study sites in New Zealand (to give
overall context), and then two satellite images of Mahinapua and Goldsborough to show the
area occupied by campsites (now Figure 2).
l. 166. Justify why the device shouldn't be heavier than 5% of the bird’s body mass and add
a reference (e.g. Geen et al 2019. Effects of tracking devices on individual birds – a review
of the evidence. Journal of Avian Biology, e01823)
Done, the sentence now reads: “Birds were only fitted with a GPS and harness if the
combined unit was no more than 5% of their body weight, as heavier devices relative to bird
body mass can result in negative effects on foraging, locomotion, and physiology [31].” Lines
225-228.
l. 167. Why 14 days of monitoring? I guess because of the lifespan of the GPS batteries, but
justify why.
We have added the following clarification: “After 14 days (the battery life of the GPS), we
recaptured the weka and removed the transmitter and harness.” Lines 229-233.
l. 170. Were these three birds those from Mahinapua Reserve?
Two were from Mahinapua, one was from Goldsborough. We have added that detail to the
text: “Three weka were unable to be recaptured after the two week monitoring period (two
individuals from Lake Mahinapua and one individual from Goldsborough), and four weka had
their GPS devices fail.” Lines 233-235.
l. 173. Report n of males and females, and n of juvenile and adults.
Done, the sentence now reads: “This left us with GPS data from 39 weka (Lake Mahinapua
n = 13, Goldsborough n = 12, Ulva Island n = 14), including both sexes (F = 11, M = 19, 5
individuals from Ulva Island and 4 juveniles from Goldsborough and Mahinapua could not be
sexed) and juvenile (n = 4) and adult individuals (n = 35).” Lines 235-239.
l. 175. Report the % of GPS fixes excluded.
We have included the following sentence: “The final dataset retained 66% of the original
fixes.” Line 246.
l. 183 onwards (Mechanistic model). As required by the journal: “Datasets, code, and other
digital materials should be deposited in an appropriate, recognised, publicly available
repository”. Therefore I recommend you to make the R-code for the Mechanistic model
available as supporting information.
This is a good point, the code has been added as an ESM (ESM 3).
l. 189. As pointed above, I think that this study focused on the estimation of seed dispersal
distances by combining GPS data and information about gut retention time could be the
place where properly report the data you have on seed retention time.
We agree, see above comment.
l. 196. Delete ‘only’
Done.
l. 218-225. It is not clear from the text if n=10 camp followers includes the juveniles or not,
because they are also camp followers according to their home range. Rewrite this part in
order to clarify that juvenile birds are n=5 and the final analysis was performed with 21 adult
birds.
Thank you for pointing this out. We have attempted to clarify this and the text now reads:
“Individuals whose core home range (defined as the 70% isopleth [29]) overlapped with the
campground were defined as birds that had a high level of human interaction (hereafter
referred to as ‘camp followers’). Birds at the two sites whose core home range did not
overlap with a campground were categorised as ‘remote’ birds. We only used adult birds for
the analysis as juvenile weka have different movement patterns to adult birds [35] and all the
juvenile birds we captured were camp followers (n = 4), which would have confounded the
model. Our analyses were therefore performed on 10 adult camp follower birds, and 11
adult remote birds.” Lines 284-292.
l. 235. You included ‘site’ as a random effect in your linear mixed effect model. However, you
are only considering 2 sites, and the use of random factors with less than 5-6 levels is not
recommended. Crawley [p. 670: Crawley, M. J. 2002. Statistical Computing: An Introduction
to Data Analysis using S-PLUS] recommended treating variables as fixed factors when there
aren’t enough levels of a factor.
As published by Bolker et al. in the following blog:
http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#should-i-treat-factor-xxx-as-fixed-
or-random
Are there enough levels of the factor in the data on which to base an estimate of the
variance of the population of effects? No, means [you should probably treat the variable as]
fixed effects.
This is a good point. We have rerun the model with site as a fixed effect rather than a
random effect. “Median dispersal distance for each bird for each plant species (obtained
from the mechanistic model) was the response variable, while human interaction (or not),
site, and plant species were the fixed effects.” Lines 294-297. Also see Table 2.
- RESULTS
l. 243. This info (< 7%) is redundant. You already said that 93-96% of the seeds are
dispersed away from the parent tree.
Noted, we have removed the latter part of the sentence. It now reads: “The mechanistic
model estimated that weka dispersed 93-96% of seeds away from the parent tree (assuming
a canopy radius of 10 m; Table 1).” Lines 325-326.
l. 253. Cite Table 2 instead of Table 1.
Done, thank you.
DISCUSSION
l. 268 You cite an important study on spatial patterns of seed dispersal, but I miss here other
important and more recent studies reporting seed dispersal kernels by birds of different sizes
to which it would be interesting compare and discuss your dispersal kernel:

Thank you for highlighting those references. We have added text comparing the weka
dispersal kernels with other studies. “The weka dispersal kernels were similar to seed
dispersal kernels calculated for medium sized volant birds dispersing Prunus mahaleb in
Spain [50], and for Sturnus unicolor and Turdus philomelos dispersing Olea europaea var.
sylvestris [51].” Lines 394-397.
l. 272. I would be more careful when talking about effectiveness in seed dispersal (also in l.
345), since it involves many other drivers besides seed dispersal distance. I think that your
results are very important for the qualitative component of the seed dispersal effectiveness. I
also but think that you can talk about effectiveness when discussing your results together
with previous information on the quantitative component of seed dispersal.
This is a good point. The sentence now reads: “Since seeds that are deposited beneath
parent canopies can suffer from disproportionate mortality due to density- and distant-
dependent mortality [52], this result demonstrates that weka provide good qualitative seed
dispersal [53]”. Lines 399-402.
We have also amended the statement on line 483 to talk about high quality seed dispersal
rather than effective seed dispersal.
l. 284-286. But are these other frugivores capable of dispersing the seeds of the large-fruited
Hinau and Miro? Please, rewrite to clarify that weka and these other frugivores overlap in
their fruit diet so they could provide complementary seed dispersal services.
We have clarified this point and the text now reads: “Despite being flightless, the mean
dispersal distances of weka compare favourably to dispersal distances calculated for some
of New Zealand’s volant frugivores, which are also capable of consuming hinau or miro
(although it should be noted that two common frugivores, bellbirds (Anthornis melanura) and
tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae) have not been recorded consuming hinau).” Lines
406-410.
l. 292. Do you know if juveniles perform dispersal movements in a certain time of the year? If
so, could these movements involve long distance dispersal events for certain plant species
with overlapping fruit phenologies? (This is just a question that rises to me when reading this
line).
Juvenile weka have been recording dispersing large distances from their natal home ranges
by Coleman et al. 1983 (Notornis), and we reference this in the text in terms of its potential
for long distance dispersal events. Bramley 2001 (Notornis) studied juvenile dispersal of
weka also, but dispersal distances were generally small (ranging from no dispersal to 3.5
km), although most would have still resulted in long distance dispersal events.
l. 304-305. Not only on enhancing gene-flow but also for colonising new sites and tracking
the climatic envelope.
Very true, we have amended the text to include these. It now reads: “These long distance
dispersal events could profoundly enhance genetic flow across extensive landscape scales,
as well as helping plants track their climatic envelope and colonize new sites.” Lines 435-
437.
l. 317. Add references to support this.
We have added the following reference to support the statement:

Comments to the Author(s)
Carpenter et al. explore the efficiency of flightless birds, in particular the New Zealand rail
weka, as seed dispersers, and further investigate the effects of increased exposure to
human presence in the landscape. Using GPS tracks from some 40 birds in three different
sites combined with mechanistic modeling of seed retention time, they find that while volant
birds are usually presumed more efficient seed dispersers, the flightless weka is a
surprisingly efficient disperser due to relatively large home ranges and unusually long seed
retention time. However, wekas are curious birds that are attracted to human activity, and
the authors noticed reduced mobility among rails in areas with human presence (e.g.
campgrounds), leading to cryptic loss of ecosystem services through reduced seed
dispersal.
This is overall a neat and well-designed study that delivers both counterintuitive and
important results. I have unusually few remarks, but I do find one issue generally
problematic: The mechanistic model of seed retention is based on an unpublished dataset of
seed retention times by the main author (“Carpenter 2018 unpubl. data”), from which the
statement also stems that the weka has the longest seed retention time in the world. Since
this is one of the two major datasets that the present paper is based upon, I do not think it is
acceptable to only refer to this as an unpublished dataset (and not make it available). In the
present paper, the probability distributions of seed dispersal distances are presented, but as
reader I am only presented with a couple of descriptive statistics of the seed retention time.
Perhaps this dataset is meant to be published in a separate manuscript, but if that
manuscript is not accepted, it renders the present one premature. In order to avoid that, I
would argue that the authors should include methods and results for the collection of that
dataset too in this manuscript. I also note that the authors have answered “Yes” to the
question whether new data is presented (true), and state that “All data used in this paper are
available as ESM 1”. The GPS logging dataset in ESM 1 is extensive and well curated, but it
only covers the tracking, and the latter statement is thus incorrect. Thus, in order to adhere
to RSOS standards, the seed retention data should make up ESM 2, and be presented in
the manuscript.
Thank you for the overall positive response to the MS. The reviewer has a very good point
about the unpublished dataset of seed retention times. We have rectified this problem as
stated above. The seed retention time dataset is available as ESM2.
I don’t think that the opening statement is correct. The authors claim that “Humans have
modified approximately 50 to 70% of the earth’s surface” and refer to Barnosky et al. (2012)
Nature. However, I do not believe that these numbers are supported by Barnosky et al.
(especially look at terrestrial vs. marine parts of the Earth, and current vs. projected
transformation).
Thank you for pointing this out. We have changed the sentence and the reference. It now
reads: “Humans have modified over half of the earth’s terrestrial surface [1], with profound
consequences for the species that use those habitats.”

The authors consistently use “weka” as plural form. As far as I, as non-newzeelander,
understand, “wekas” would be the correct plural form of weka, although I also understand
that “weka” is sometimes used also as plural.
We can see why this might be confusing. Weka is a te reo word from the maori (indigenous
people of New Zealand) language. There is no ‘s’ in te reo so ‘weka’ can be both singular
and plural. We have added this to the text and it now reads: “Weka (as a maori word, the
spelling is the same for singular and plural) are bold, opportunistic birds that frequently
aggregate at areas of high human use, such as campsites or picnic areas [19]”. Line 97.
References 5, 24, 26, 38, 42 have missing or incorrect details or incorrect formatting.
We have corrected these references.
As a very minor comment, I would advise the authors to present Figure 2 as boxplots rather
than a bar chart, given the type of data.
We appreciate this suggestion and have changed the graph to show boxplots rather than
bars (new Figure 5).
Apart from the treatment of seed retention data, all other comments are minor, and would
render an “Accept with minor revision”. In my opinion, if the availability and treatment of seed
retention data (preferably by inclusion in the manuscript and as supplement or data
deposition), this manuscript is in good shape and qualifies for publication in RSOS.
However, as is, I therefore recommend a “Major revision”.
This is a study of estimated seed dispersal distances by populations of a flightless rail in three
sites. From my understanding, adults and juveniles are tracked at three different sites. Then
seed dispersal was estimated only for adults, and only for two of the sites (those with some
adult birds using a campsite and other birds using other habitats). Seed dispersal is estimated
based on unpublished retention time data, and it seems that neither these data nor the
movement data per se are made available by the authors (Q: is that not against the policy of
this journal?).
Thank you for your comments. Seed dispersal distances were calculated for all birds from all sites.
We then just used adult birds at two sites with a hub of high human use to test whether seed
dispersal distances were shorter when birds had more human interaction. The movement data are
fully accessible as ESM1, and the seed retention time methods, results, and data are now also
available.
There seems to be no use of real data on true diet or the location or the timing of seed
ingestion data, so in that sense the seed dispersal distance estimates cannot be considered to
be reliable. Neither are there data presented that show that the rails disperse these plants at
these sites, although perhaps some such data are included in reference 21.
Mechanistic models of seed dispersal kernels using movement data and seed retention time data are
frequently used to estimate seed dispersal distances for animals with no use of diet data or timing of
seed ingestion (e.g. Holbrook and Smith 2000, Santamaria et al. 2007, Ward and Paton 2007, Lenz et
al. 2011). Other diet studies have already demonstrated that weka eat many fruits (e.g. Carpenter et
al. 2018, Coleman et al. 1983) and the exact timing of ingestion is irrelevant as weka can be active
and feed at all hours of the day and night (most other studies simply model their seed ingestion
times during the day for diurnal species). We did not collect data to show that weka specifically
consume hinau and miro at these sites as weka have already been shown to eat these two plant
species’ fruits (Carpenter et al. 2018, Kelly et al. 2010).
The reported effects seem believable and are somewhat equivalent to showing that ducks in
urban ponds, where people feed them bread, fly around less (and disperse seeds over shorter
distances) than ducks in natural wetlands. This is not very surprising, but there is only a weakly
significant effect and the statistical analyses do not seem to me to be robust, since there is
really only a sample size of two (i.e. the two locations where birds are compared with and
without a campsite).
We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. Each individual bird gives a data point (median seed
dispersal distance) and therefore the sample size for the analysis is 21 (21 birds). Birds could behave
differently so are independent tests of the hypothesis. Moreover, we used two sites, each with a
treatment (human interaction) and non treatment (remote) area. This spatial replication covering
birds in two different areas makes our analyses even more robust.
Furthermore, it may be that there is some other confounding variable,
e.g. the campsites are positioned in low-lying areas with more emergent vegetation that
provides more natural food (if these rails behave anything like Porphyrio).
We never saw weka foraging for natural food in the campsites, which consist largely of mown grass.
The nearby non-campsite areas are similar in altitude, so we think there are no other obvious
confounding factors.
I did not understand how the movement data from the third site was used, but it looks like the
same data from the other sites was used twice, first to construct a dispersal kernel, then to use
that kernel to predict seed movement. This strikes me as an important source of error on the
distance estimates that needs to be recognized by the authors, and perhaps means that the
dispersal estimates for different individual birds are not at all independent.
We are unsure what the reviewer means here. Movement data from weka at all three sites was used
in a mechanistic model to create seed dispersal kernels for weka. This is the common approach
when using movement data and seed retention time data in a mechanistic model to create seed
dispersal kernels.
In any case,
movements of birds living together cannot strictly speaking be considered as independent (as
they are in your statistical models), as they will obviously influence each other e.g. through
antagonistic behaviour or conspecific attraction.
We agree that birds that occur in the same habitat may influence each others movement. However,
as this is environmentally realistic (i.e., these birds would almost never occur in complete isolation) it
leads to more accurate estimates of how far these birds actually disperse seeds in a ‘normal’
ecological setting. All the papers we are aware of that compute mechanistic models for species’ seed
dispersal kernels use animals that are part of the same community and therefore may be influencing
each others’ movements (e.g. Lenz et al. 2011, Wotton and Kelly 2012).
I think the paper would be much stronger if it focused more on the movement data and
included the third site (no campsite) data and the juvenile data, making a clear comparison in
movement patterns between them all. The seed dispersal estimates are rough approximations
(for the reasons given above), and should be a secondary part of the paper. In my opinion,
they are not strong enough to make a stand alone paper in a high quality journal. Perhaps
there is some plant to split the data into different papers, but that can be counterproductive.
As we mention above, we believe our method of constructing mechanistic models to estimate seed
dispersal distances from the movement data and the seed retention data is a tried and tested
approach that has been used to estimate seed dispersal kernels for multiple species with good
results. We actually think the seed dispersal distances we calculated for weka as a species are
particularly robust because we used such a large sample size of birds (n = 39) across three sites.
Most studies to date have smaller sample sizes of birds and they only study their movement at one
site (e.g. Holbrook and Smith 2000; Lenz et al. 2011).
Another thing of concern is the manner in which the paper is written as if seed dispersal only
occurs through frugivory, ignoring the important dispersal of other seeds by rallids through
granivory, e.g. see Bartel et al. 2018, Thorsen et al. 2009, Green et al. 2016. I was left
wondering what other plants are dispersed by these rails, e.g. given the importance of
Porphyrio as a vector for Eleocharis (Bell 2000).
This is a good point, and we appreciate the reviewer highlighting this for us. We have added text to
acknowledge that weka could also disperse seeds through granivory, and that other rails have been
reporting doing so. See below.
“Weka also may disperse the seeds of monocots or dry seeds through granivory, an overlooked yet
important seed dispersal mechanism that has been demonstrated for other rail species such as
Eurasian Coots (Fulica atra)[62].” Lines 480-483.
“More broadly, our research into the seed dispersal capabilities of weka suggests that other rails
across the Pacific may have been important seed dispersers, even though they are rarely mentioned
as such. However, Porphyrio species have been recorded as significant vectors of Coprosma seeds
both within and between New Zealand and the Pacific, and Scleria seeds were found in the gut of
Porphyrio in Fiji (cited in [63]).” Lines 499-502.
MINOR COMMENTS
28 overstated, e.g. there are many papers about the influence of disturbance on waterfowl,
which are major seed vectors (e.g. papers by Madsen and Stillman)
This is a good point. We have modified the sentence and it now states: “Human presence is
becoming increasingly ubiquitous, but the influence this has on the seed dispersal services
performed by frugivorous animals is largely unknown”. Lines 27-28. We feel this is a fair statement
as while many studies have examined how disturbance affects animals (some of which are seed
dispersers), very few have looked specifically at how seed dispersal services were affected as a
result.
62 “are reduced” should be “can be reduced” since this is not a universal finding
True, we have modified the sentence as suggested and it now reads: “Due to these mechanisms,
movements of mammals in intensively human-modified areas can be reduced by half to two-thirds
compared with individuals in areas with less human modification [5], and similar reductions in
vagility have been documented for other taxa (e.g.[6,7]).” Lines 60-64.
104 some explanation for extraordinary retention times should be offered, and these
unpublished data should be made available. These are not so extraordinary in the light of
Proctor 1968.
We have now included the methods, results, and data from the seed retention time study in this
paper. We have also inserted a paragraph in the discussion which compares weka seed retention
times to those of other birds and demonstrates that they are some of the longest avian seed
retention times ever recorded.
123 again this looks like the authors are ignoring the existence of seed dispersal by
herbivorous and granivorous birds e.g. by introduced black swans (Green et al. 2008).
This is a good point, we have changed the sentence and it now states: “Weka are one of the largest
(mean 900 g, range 400-1700 g) extant frugivorous birds in New Zealand [24].” Lines 125-126.
153 Exactly how these data were used needs explaining somewhere.
It is explained in the latter half of the paragraph: “Ulva Island had no hub of high human use so was
not used for this analysis, but was still used to estimate overall weka seed dispersal distances.” Line
216-217.
272 overstated, you present no information about dispersal quality since there are no results
about how many virtual seeds would be deposited under the canopy of different trees, or in
more suitable microhabitats. Hence you have not demonstrated highly effective dispersal. For
that, you would at least need to present information on the estimated proportions of different
habitats to which seeds are moved, and some idea of the value of each for seedling
establishment.
We see the reviewer’s point that data on microsite deposition would be excellent to have, and this is
an important component of dispersal quality. However the distance that seeds are dispersed and the
proportion of seeds that are dispersed away from the parent canopy are still important facets of
seed dispersal quality, so we do not think the sentence is overstated.
333 in particular, it should be mentioned that dispersal can increase dispersal distances, e.g.
when waterbirds are regularly disturbed and forced to fly to different wetlands.
This is a very good point. We have added the following sentence to acknowledge this: “However, it
should be noted that in some cases human disturbance may have the potential to increase seed
dispersal distances of some species, for example when water birds are regularly disturbed and fly to
different wetlands [58].” Lines 449-452.
342-44 presumably you mean 26 fleshy fruited species, I bet they disperse even more species
that don’t have a fleshy fruit (including those with a dry fruit).
That is true, we have amended the sentence and it now reads: “They have been recorded consuming
the fruits of over 26 native fleshy fruited plant species, including some of New Zealand’s largest-
seeded species [61], and the fruits of low-growing divaricating shrubs. Weka also may disperse the
seeds of monocots or dry seeds through granivory, an overlooked yet important seed dispersal
mechanism that has been demonstrated for other rail species such as Eurasian Coots (Fulica
atra)[62].” Lines 477-483.
482 This reference 27 seems incomplete, and ref 26 also seems wrong. Grey literature that is
not available to a reader is best left uncited, or details of the important content provided in
supplementary material.
We have fixed the references.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The paper has clearly improved a lot after full disclosure of the retention time experiment.
However, I stand by my earlier comments which the authors have chosen to dismiss. In
particular in two sites, birds are compared between two groups, those associated with a
camp site and those not. In principle, there could be many reasons why there is a difference
in movement between birds using one part of a habitat and another. There are only two
places where there is a comparison made between camp and other. Hence it is perfectly
possible that the results have a different explanation, the real sample size of importance is N
= 2 study sites, in both of which a similar spatial pattern is recorded. Given this reality, and in
the absence of other data I think the conclusions need to be presented with some more
caution.
We thank the reviewer for their comments on the paper, which have greatly improved it. As
the reviewer notes, however, we disagree about interpretation of the movement data. The
key point is about the relevant level of independence for the question being asked. Within
each area, we had multiple birds, varying in size, sex, experience, whether their ranges
include the camp, and other attributes. Our stats use birds as replicates, because each bird
makes its own decisions about movement and hence is an independent sample of
movement data. When classified into two groups by one attribute (use camp areas vs not
using camps), there was a significant difference in seed dispersal distance. The main reason
for including two different sites is that the difference in bird movement associated with camp
use at one site may be caused by some other unknown variable which happened to be
confounded with camp location. By having two independent sites, and finding the same trend
for birds when classified by camp, we gain confidence that the demonstrated difference in
ranges of individual birds was causally linked to use of camp areas (and consequent
interaction with humans), rather than caused by an unknown confounding factor. So the two
sites are important for generalization about causes, but the relevant sample size for testing
numerical differences in bird range areas remains the number of birds. Having said that, two
independent sites make unknown confounding factors unlikely, but not impossible. Hence in
recognition of the reviewer’s point, we added to the discussion: “In addition, it is possible that
there were other unmeasured factors associated with the campsites (other than human
presence) which affected weka seed dispersal distances.”
In this new version I have the following specific comments:
There is a lack of clarity about what is meant by “quality of seed dispersal” e.g. in line 105 or
483. If we compare the paper with Schupp et al. 2017, I do not see what component of
quality (as defined in that paper) is being studied herein. The effectiveness framework as
presented says very little about dispersal distance, unlike this rail paper. I suggest it is best
to just talk of dispersal distance rather than “quality”.
We have changed all references in the paper to ‘dispersal quality’ to ‘dispersal distance’, as
recommended by the reviewer.
Line 113 Explain/spell out what RFID is.
We have added more detail to the sentence. It now reads: “Our aims were to: 1) estimate
weka seed retention times using a novel RFID (radio-frequency identification) microchip
method, which records when ingested microchipped seeds were still inside weka.”
132-134 A clear justification is required here for why you are modelling dispersal of these
two plant species, since you present no data on the consumption or abundance of these two
plant species in your study area. Ultimately it is because you have data from a captive
experiment, but this needs pointing out. And some idea of the distribution of these two plant
species in the study area should be given.
We have added the following text to clarify why we were interested in these two plant
species in particular: “We were particularly interested in these two species as weka have
been shown to be the most important disperser for hinau in terms of fruit removal [20], and
they are also likely to be an important disperser for miro where weka they are present as its
large fruits are consumed by few other species [21]. In addition, both plant species feature
some fruit traits (e.g. early abscission, thick seed coats) that suggest they may be partially
adapted for dispersal by flightless birds such as weka [26], and are found throughout all
(miro) or nearly all (hinau) of the range of weka.”
At the three field sites used for GPS tracking, both plants are present except for hinau being
absent at Ulva Island. We thought it would be potentially confusing to detail this (in a later
part of the Methods section), as the field sites only measured bird movements, not ingestion
of particular plant species; the actual plant species growing at the field sites were irrelevant
to those experiments. If a reader was interested in this, the above new text in combination
with Fig 2 would make clear to them that the Ulva site was beyond the range of hinau.
160-161 Discuss the possible consequences of removing the fleshy exocarp from miro
seeds on the results, especially retention time. You assume that removing pulp makes no
difference, but what studies in other organisms support such an assumption? Furthermore,
the seeds were smeared with cheese, might that not influence retention time? At least say
why you think not.
This is a good point. We have added the following text to the discussion: “In addition, our
removal of the fruit pulp of miro may have affected weka seed retention times for that
species, as the secondary metabolites within fruit pulp can alter seed retention times [47–
49]. Here we found long retention times both in hinau (which had the fruit pulp intact) and
miro (which had the fruit pulp removed), although we cannot determine what might have
happened if fruit pulp had been removed for hinau or left intact for miro. Similarly, the cheese
we smeared on the fruits may have affected the weka seed retention times, although we
think this is unlikely given how long the seeds remained inside the birds.”
433 “very long distance dispersal” seems a significant exaggeration to me for a flightless
bird. I would apply that term rather to birds that move a much greater distance of hundreds
of km, e.g. Viana et al.
This is a fair point. We have removed the ‘very’ from the sentence so it now reads: “These
occasional long distance movements, coupled with seed retention times that can reach 40
days, demonstrate that weka almost certainly generate rare long distance dispersal events
beyond what could be documented with our mechanistic model (which also underestimated
dispersal distances for several technical reasons as noted in Methods).”

Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
I think that the authors have addressed all of the issues brought up by the reviewers in a
satisfactory manner, and improved the manuscript greatly. With the explicit inclusion of the
seed retention estimation, and the provision of that dataset, the manuscripts is now
“complete” and meets the open access standards of RSOS. With a minor edit (see below) I
think that this study is now suitable for publication.
After reading the revised manuscript, I only find one minor issue that could easily be
addressed. For some reason, in a single passage, only scientific names are used. I would
strongly suggest that in the final version of the manuscript, the common names are inserted
for lines 395–397. The birds are spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) and song thrush (Turdus
philomelos), the trees wild olive (Olea europaea var. sylvestris) and mahaleb cherry (Prunus
mahaleb) [although the latter one may also be known also under other common names].
We thank the reviewer for their suggestions. We have made the suggested amendment. The
sentence now reads: “The weka dispersal kernels were similar to seed dispersal kernels
calculated for medium sized volant birds dispersing mahaleb cherry (Prunus mahaleb) in
Spain [51], and for spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) and song thrush (Turdus philomelos)
dispersing wild olive (Olea europaea var. sylvestris) [52].”
