This paper draws from an important set of theories in biology, partner choice theories, and uses
these theories to motivate an important question: How do people trade-off willingness and ability
to share in cooperative partners? To answer this question, the authors conducted a
straightforward and elegant experiment. Their results are clear: people favor fair partners over
rich partners, particularly when wealth is unstable. Beyond the scientific quality and rigor, the
paper is also written in an admirably clear style.
Although I think this paper could be published as is with no problem, a couple issues struck me
that the authors could address if they chose.
Regarding the statistical method, it took me a little bit the realize that the alpha values were the
effective alphas used for a particular test (right?). So on the technique the authors’ used, if p =
.001 (a conventionally significant value), but their adjusted alpha value = .00001, then given their
correction, the test would not in fact be significant. The authors could consider adding a few
sentences on this to the supplement.
The authors did not run all possible combinations of scenarios (e.g., Rich-Fair versus Rioch-Stingy
or any ones where the two dictators were identical in wealth and choice). This is eminently
understandable given the exponential growth in conditions this would entail. But the authors did
not directly address why they made choices they made here, which could be helpful to readers.
Presumably, they chose the most inferentially relevant main condition and closest controls (e.g.,
Rich-Fair versus Rich-Stingy would reveal only the obvious that people prefer fair dictators in the
DG). They might consider adding a sentence or two on this to help readers understand their
design choices.
In the figure, could the authors add a legend that explains the bar colors, rather than embedding
it in the caption?
In the table, could the authors report percentages rather than n’s? Interested readers could always
use the percentages and overall sample sizes to convert back to n’s. Using percentages would
make cross-scenario comparison easier in the table. Alternatively or additionally, they could
include a figure in the supplement that shows an analogue of Figure 1 but with all scenarios
included.
Again, I think the paper is publishable and a great contribution in its current form. These
suggestions do not change that opinion.

In this paper, the authors are interested in partner choice in humans. Specifically, they are
interested in the question of how people trade off two desirable traits in potential partners: ability
and willingness to provide resources. They ask subjects whether they would rather be the
recipient in a Dictator Game when paired with somebody who was previously rich (got a large
endowment) versus poor (got a small endowment), and who previously was fair (shared 50%)
versus stingy (shared 20%). They also manipulate wealth stability (the probability that somebody
who was previously rich (poor) will be rich (poor) again).
I think the authors ask an interesting question and design the experiment appropriately. The
results make sense, and I think the paper will make a good contribution to the literature.
However, I have a general comment about the framing of the research question and of the results.
It seems to me that there is not much reason to expect humans to categorically prioritize wealth
over fairness or vice versa. It seems to make more sense that we would value both wealth and
fairness, assign weights to each trait (and assign more or less weight depending on assessed
stability of the trait in the particular context), and then make a decision that would depend on the
magnitude of the disparity between prospective partners on each trait. In other words, I don't
really think that there is a general answer to the question "do we care more about wealth or
fairness?". I agree with the authors that we should care relatively less about wealth when wealth
is less stable, but I also think we should care relatively less about fairness when fairness is less
stable. In the experiment in question, fairness was pretty stable, but that's likely because it was an
abstract game that was played twice in a row. It seems like there definitely could be contexts in
life where two fairness-based decisions were pretty different, or there were relevant extenuating
circumstances surrounding the first decision (e.g. somebody was in a bad mood, or didn't like the
recipient, or was being watched by their boss), which would call into question the stability of
fairness behavior across decisions. And I would expect this to reduce the weight people place on
fairness decisions when choosing a partner.
4
Consequently, then, I don't really think the authors' finding that subjects prioritized fairness over
wealth when wealth was unstable is a particularly general finding. For example, it seems like if
they redid the experiment but made the endowment in the "rich" condition $50 instead of $2.50,
they would almost certainly get the opposite result, because it would always be worth picking
whichever partner was most likely to have $50 so long as wealth was at least somewhat stable
(which it was, even in the unstable condition). My impression is thus that the answers the authors
found to their questions were dependant on the specific payoffs / probabilities that they used.
Despite this, the authors seem to talk about their research question and results as if this were not
the case. For example, they say at the end of their introduction: "We expected that quality would
typically be prioritised over fairness, but that fairness would be prioritised when quality was
unstable." But what is the basis for the first half of this claim? It appears to be a general prediction
about how this tradeoff would generally go in life, which, as argued above, I don't think makes a
lot of sense. (Regardless of if the authors agree with this point, it would be good to justify this
prediction when it is presented in the paper).
Similarly, after reporting their findings, the authors say "Here, however, we show that
willingness to give (i.e. fairness) is only significantly preferred when ability (quality) is an
unstable trait. This study illuminates how how partner quality is traded-off against fairness and
emphasises the crucial role of quality stability in mediating these decisions." I definitely agree
that they show that quality stability mediates decisions (and I absolutely think this is a general
finding), but I feel like this wording suggests that the finding that fairness is preferred over
ability when quality is unstable is also a general finding that we can expect to apply in all sorts of
settings. As argued above, I don't think this would hold, for example, if the endowment in the
rich condition was much higher.
So, in sum, I think that the authors' answer to their key question "which do we prioritize, wealth
or fairness" is unlikely to be general, because I think this question is unlikely to have a general
answer. I would like, in a revision, for the authors to revise their manuscript to either rebut this
criticism, or to reframe their question and results. I also think it would be good to acknowledge
that in the same way that wealth can be unstable or stable, fairness could also be stable or
unstable--and this factor would probably also affect preferences in this domain.

In this paper, the authors are interested in partner choice in humans. Specifically, they are

who was previously rich (poor) will be rich (poor) again).
I think the authors ask an interesting question and design the experiment appropriately. The
results make sense, and I think the paper will make a good contribution to the literature.
However, I have a general comment about the framing of the research question and of the results.
It seems to me that there is not much reason to expect humans to categorically prioritize wealth

fairness, assign weights to each trait (and assign more or less weight depending on assessed
stability of the trait in the particular context), and then make a decision that would depend on the

really think that there is a general answer to the question "do we care more about wealth or
fairness?". I agree with the authors that we should care relatively less about wealth when wealth
is less stable, but I also think we should care relatively less about fairness when fairness is less
stable. In the experiment in question, fairness was pretty stable, but that's likely because it was an
abstract game that was played twice in a row. It seems like there definitely could be contexts in
life where two fairness-based decisions were pretty different, or there were relevant extenuating
circumstances surrounding the first decision (e.g. somebody was in a bad mood, or didn't like the
9
recipient, or was being watched by their boss), which would call into question the stability of
fairness behavior across decisions. And I would expect this to reduce the weight people place on
fairness decisions when choosing a partner.
Consequently, then, I don't really think the authors' finding that subjects prioritized fairness over
wealth when wealth was unstable is a particularly general finding. For example, it seems like if
they redid the experiment but made the endowment in the "rich" condition $50 instead of $2.50,

ear Editor, Dear Authors,
is is a clear, clean, serious study without major issues to criticize.
ave only one significant comment, and a few minor ones.
ain comment:
egarding the results and their interpretation. It would be interesting if the
thors computed and shown the expected gain of the chooser (in the
cond game) with each type of partner and each type of condition (fair/
far ; rich/poor ; stable/unstable). These quantities can be computed easily
ssuming that partner’s fairness is stable).
is would allow to highlight an important aspect of the present results which,
hink, is not enough commented by the authors: the fact that the choosers
e often ready to sacrifice a gain in order to choose a fair partner. This
curs when the chooser has the choice between a rich/stingy and a poor/fair
rtner in the stable condition. Rationality would predict that choosers should
oose the rich/stingy in 100% of cases (because the expected gain is
ger). Yet, in 50% of cases they purposefully choose the poor/fair guy. The
erpretation of this observation is not totally clear. I see three possibilities:
Choosers simply mis-calculated the expected gain. A pure cognitive issue.
Not very interesting.
In real life, partner choice is a long term issue (not just for a single game),
and wealth is rarely stable in the long term. Hence, it is often better to
choose the fair partner over the rich one.
) Partner choice is itself a moral decision. Maybe also choosers find it
unfair to choose the rich and unfair player. Or, conversely, they find it
unfair to reject a fair person, just because she is poor. So choosers need
to choose between their immediate interest (choosing the rich) and their
long-term moral reputation (not being seen as someone treating badly a
poor but fair person).
yway, independently of the precise interpretation of this result, I find it
sleading when the authors say in the discussion that « willingness to give
e. fairness) is only significantly preferred when ability (quality) is an
stable trait ». This would be true only if choosers did not prefer fairness at
(even when wealth was constant across players). But this is not the case.
d even when wealth varies across players, the fact that 50% of choosers
ll prefer the poor partner is not only an absence of preference, but an
eresting (apparent) paradox.
nor comments:
One paper by Bliege Bird & Power seems particularly relevant for the
present study and should be cited and commented (Bliege Bird & Power
2015. Prosocial signaling and cooperation among Martu hunters. Evol.
Hum. Behav). In a social network study, Bliege Bird & Power show that
more generous hunters tend to be more central and have more
cooperation partners in the cooperative network, whereas they find no
tendency for the better hunters on average to be more central in the
cooperative network. This is interesting because this parallels the present
study ; good/bad hunters being the equivalent of rich/poor players.
Line 15 : I find it a little strange to read that the authors have chosen
humans as a « model species ». It is strange for two reasons. First,
understanding human social behavior is interesting in itself and not only as
a model for other species (in contrast with understanding the gut diseases
of mice or the genetics of drosophila, which are interesting really as
models). Second, human is so peculiar in the intensity of its
cooperativeness that we are probably the worst model for understanding
most other species! However, I certainly do not want to be picky on such a
secondary issue.
Line 34 : « In many cases, ability and willingness to cooperate may be
correlated ». I do not understand this claim. It is not supported by data,
and it’s not really useful here.
Line 139 : « how how »
Line 150 : « in » not « is »
To the editor,
We would like to thank all three reviewers for their positive assessment and constructive
criticism, which we believe has strengthened this manuscript. Please find below our detailed
responses to each reviewer. In addition to these responses, we also made a few minor
revisions (moved the description of Mechanical Turk from the supplementary material to the
main text, and added some new references).

Thanks for the positive feedback.
Although I think this paper could be published as is with no problem, a couple issues struck
me that the authors could address if they chose.
Regarding the statistical method, it took me a little bit the realize that the alpha values were
the effective alphas used for a particular test (right?). So on the technique the authors’ used, if
p = .001 (a conventionally significant value), but their adjusted alpha value = .00001, then
given their correction, the test would not in fact be significant. The authors could consider
adding a few sentences on this to the supplement.
We have added a line in the main manuscript (line 85) as follows:
Thus, results should only be taken as conventionally significant where p < a.
The authors did not run all possible combinations of scenarios (e.g., Rich-Fair versus Rich-
Stingy or any ones where the two dictators were identical in wealth and choice). This is
eminently understandable given the exponential growth in conditions this would entail. But
the authors did not directly address why they made choices they made here, which could be
helpful to readers. Presumably, they chose the most inferentially relevant main condition and
closest controls (e.g., Rich-Fair versus Rich-Stingy would reveal only the obvious that people
prefer fair dictators in the DG). They might consider adding a sentence or two on this to help
readers understand their design choices.
The paragraph from line 71 has been amended as follows:
The experiment was designed such that rich dictators always offered higher absolute payoffs
than poor dictators, even if they were stingy. Accordingly, we predicted that (i) choosers
would typically prefer rich partners, so long as wealth was stable and both partners were
equally fair; but that (ii) poor-fair partners might be preferred over rich-stingy partners, and
that (iii) this preference would be most pronounced in the wealth-unstable condition. To test
these predictions, it was not necessary to run conditions where dictators were equally
wealthy, but differed in fairness. As such, we did not run conditions comparing receiver
responses to Rich-Fair versus Rich-Stingy dictators, or Poor-Fair versus Poor-Stingy (see Table
1 for all conditions that were run). We had no prior expectations about how accurate
choosers would be when predicting the preferences of other choosers.
In the figure, could the authors add a legend that explains the bar colors, rather than
embedding it in the caption?
Added the legend – though we also kept the explanation in the caption.
In the table, could the authors report percentages rather than n’s? Interested readers could
always use the percentages and overall sample sizes to convert back to n’s. Using percentages
would make cross-scenario comparison easier in the table. Alternatively or additionally, they
could include a figure in the supplement that shows an analogue of Figure 1 but with all
scenarios included.

other words, I don't really think that there is a general answer to the question "do we care
more about wealth or fairness?". I agree with the authors that we should care relatively less
about wealth when wealth is less stable, but I also think we should care relatively less about
fairness when fairness is less stable. In the experiment in question, fairness was pretty stable,
but that's likely because it was an abstract game that was played twice in a row. It seems like
there definitely could be contexts in life where two fairness-based decisions were pretty
different, or there were relevant extenuating circumstances surrounding the first decision (e.g.
somebody was in a bad mood, or didn't like the recipient, or was being watched by their boss),
which would call into question the stability of fairness behavior across decisions. And I
would expect this to reduce the weight people place on fairness decisions when choosing a
partner.
This is a reasonable concern. The assumption of consistency in cooperative behaviour is
supported by the current empirical literature suggests that people’s pro-social
behaviour is relatively consistent across interactions and contexts (Peysakhovich et al.
2014). These empirical observations support the predictions of theoretical models
demonstrating that consistent variation in social traits can persist when observers
respond to this variation (McNamara & Houston 2002; Wolf et al. 2007). Thus, we
believe that the assumption of fairness being relatively consistent (also supported by our
empirical study) is reasonable. We have modified the section from line 158 as follows,
and included some new supporting references:
In this study, the fact that choosers preferred poor-fair partners over rich-stingy ones
(particularly when wealth was unstable) indicates that they believed that fairness was a
relatively stable trait. How justified is this belief? Theoretical models support the idea that
costly cooperation can be a consistent trait: initial variation in a population (arising through
mutation or other random processes) can favour the evolution of responsive individuals, who
choose or avoid partners on the basis of their actions [18]. These responsive individuals can,
in turn, favour the evolution of consistency in social behaviours, even when these behaviours
are costly to perform [18-20]. The assumption that cooperativeness is a relatively stable trait
also has empirical support: social decision-making is relatively stable over time and contexts
[21], even in relatively 'noisy' environments like MTurk [22]. Most importantly, in the context
of the current study, dictator decisions in game 1 were highly predictive of their decisions in
game 2, even (albeit to a lesser extent) when their wealth changed. Thus, choosers could
reliably infer dictators' future behaviour from their previous actions.
Consequently, then, I don't really think the authors' finding that subjects prioritized fairness
over wealth when wealth was unstable is a particularly general finding. For example, it seems
like if they redid the experiment but made the endowment in the "rich" condition $50 instead
of $2.50, they would almost certainly get the opposite result, because it would always be
worth picking whichever partner was most likely to have $50 so long as wealth was at least
somewhat stable (which it was, even in the unstable condition). My impression is thus that
the answers the authors found to their questions were dependant on the specific payoffs /
probabilities that they used.
Despite this, the authors seem to talk about their research question and results as if this were
not the case. For example, they say at the end of their introduction: "We expected that quality
would typically be prioritised over fairness, but that fairness would be prioritised when
quality was unstable." But what is the basis for the first half of this claim? It appears to be a
general prediction about how this tradeoff would generally go in life, which, as argued above,
I don't think makes a lot of sense. (Regardless of if the authors agree with this point, it would
be good to justify this prediction when it is presented in the paper).
Similarly, after reporting their findings, the authors say "Here, however, we show that
willingness to give (i.e. fairness) is only significantly preferred when ability (quality) is an
unstable trait. This study illuminates how how partner quality is traded-off against fairness
and emphasises the crucial role of quality stability in mediating these decisions." I definitely
agree that they show that quality stability mediates decisions (and I absolutely think this is a
general finding), but I feel like this wording suggests that the finding that fairness is preferred
over ability when quality is unstable is also a general finding that we can expect to apply in
all sorts of settings. As argued above, I don't think this would hold, for example, if the
endowment in the rich condition was much higher.
These are legitimate concerns. First, we have removed the prediction from the
introduction that quality would be prioritized over fairness. This prediction was made
based on the payoffs we used in our study (where high quality always trumps fairness)
but as this was not explained until the methods section, we agreed that the prediction
seemed to be unsubstantiated as it appeared in the introduction.
The line referred to in the discussion has now been amended as follows:
The preference for fairness is most strongly pronounced when wealth is unstable,
emphasising the important role of quality stability in mediating partner choice decisions.
Also we included a paragraph in the discussion (line 148 on) outlining the point that
trade off between wealth and fairness might lead to different thresholds for preferring
quality over fairness as follows:
Another important consideration in future studies will be to explore how willingness and
ability to give are traded off against one another when there are large disparities in quality
and/or fairness in a population. For instance, it is not clear how our results might change if
we assumed far larger differences, either in quality or in fairness. We suggest that the
generality of the current findings could best be tackled using theoretical models, which could
define the thresholds at which individuals are willing to accept high quality, unfair partners
over lower quality, fair ones. Similar approaches have been used in the context of
understanding mate choice in females – specifically for defining the thresholds at which
females should accept mating polygynously with a high quality male versus mating
monogamously with an inferior male [17] - and could be used to understand partner choice
in other contexts.
So, in sum, I think that the authors' answer to their key question "which do we prioritize,
wealth or fairness" is unlikely to be general, because I think this question is unlikely to have a
general answer. I would like, in a revision, for the authors to revise their manuscript to either
rebut this criticism, or to reframe their question and results. I also think it would be good to
acknowledge that in the same way that wealth can be unstable or stable, fairness could also
be stable or unstable--and this factor would probably also affect preferences in this domain.
Reviewer: 3
Comment: Please include a table with expected payoffs from the different conditions.
This is a great idea and we have now included this as Table 2 – and refer to it in
interpretation of the results as suggested by Reviewer 3.
This would allow to highlight an important aspect of the present results which, I think, is not
enough commented by the authors: the fact that the choosers are often ready to sacrifice a
gain in order to choose a fair partner.
Thanks for this suggestion. We now have the following paragraph in the results, which
we believe suggests a really interesting and previously overlooked interpretation of our
data patterns:
Although fairness in game 1 was predictive of fairness in game 2, it is somewhat surprising
that over 50 % of choosers stated an (economically irrational) preference for a poor-fair
partner (over a rich-stingy one) when wealth was stable. Under the assumption that fairness
is a stable trait, the expected payoffs associated with choosing the rich-stingy partner
outweigh those associated with choosing the poor-fair one when wealth is stable (Table 2),
suggesting that choosers are often willing to sacrifice payoffs in order to select a fair partner.
One simple explanation for this could be that choosers simply miscalculated the payoffs
associated with choosing the rich or poor partner, respectively. Though possible, this
explanation seems relatively unlikely as chooser preferences (or lack of preference) aligned
with expected payoffs in all other conditions. Instead, we suggest that the avoidance of rich-
stingy dictators can also be interpreted as a form of third-party punishment [23]: by
incurring a cost to choose the poor-fair partner, choosers may have believed that they were
preventing the rich-stingy dictator from taking part in another game and thereby imposing a
punishment cost on this individual. Indeed, choosers were not informed that dictators would
play with another individual, even if the chooser did not choose them. Proximate motives to
invest in third-party punishment can be supported on a functional level if, for example, the
punisher derives signalling benefits from their actions [24,25]. To explore this idea further, in
future studies, it would be interesting to determine whether individuals who forego expected
payoffs to reject rich-stingy partners are also more likely to invest in conventional third-party
punishment of a stingy dictator, and whether they gain reputation benefits for their actions
(e.g. [25,26]). Although several studies have shown how rejecting an uncooperative partner
can be self-serving decision [27], no study to our knowledge has described scenarios where
partner rejection could operate as a form of costly third-party punishment (i.e. when
accepting an uncooperative partner would nevertheless yield higher payoffs than accepting
a cooperative one). This suggests interesting avenues for further theoretical and empirical
exploration.
We also now cite and discuss the very important paper by Bliege-Bird & Power and made
all the other changes suggested by Reviewer 3.
We hope that the reviewers will find these revisions acceptable and look forward to
hearing back from you in due course.
