Line 61 – The authors state that “Pseudocellus specimens formed a single clade without much
genetic variability”. However, this statement doesn’t seem entirely consistent with Fig S1 (e.g,
split between P_102697 versus other samples), or FIG 1 (although it’s hard to tell what branch
lengths mean in FIG 1)?. I don’t think that this issue impacts downstream sampling design, but
text accuracy regarding the result is important. Similar claim again made on line 99.
Line 66 – What is Cryptocellus sp nov (IZ-30913). In particular, how does this relate to samples
shown on the COI tree (FIG S1)??
Line 72 – Are these gene occupancy values correct?
Line 102 – Referring to FIG 2, the authors claim “no conflict at the gene tree level”. However, FIG
2 suggests a near trichotomy at the base of Ricinulei, somewhat at odds with the topology shown
in FIG 1b. Is it true that ALL of the gene trees recover the exact same topology within Ricinulei?
Again, this issue doesn’t greatly impact the general phylogenomic results of the paper, but the
statement seems like an oversimplification of reality.
Figure 1b – The grey star for calibration within Ricinulei is unclear? Is this supposed to represent
the base of the crown group? Also, there are many more grey stars shown on this figure
(calibration points) than discussed in the Supp Material (11 on figure, only 2 or 3 discussed in
text)??
Figure 1b – Why are BI values > 0.9 shown as solid? It would be more valuable and transparent
to show values > 0.95.
Figure 1b – This tree must result from a particular analysis (e.g., inference method and
supermatrix), but it’s not clear what this this?
Supplemental Material – In discussing the different supermatrices, it would be relevant to know
how much missing data there is for the ingroup taxa.
Supplemental Material – In discussing the fossil calibrations, the authors are very “casual” about
the calibration of the key Myanmar fossil. The 98 million-year-old Myanmar fossil, described as a
Palaeoricinulei by the original authors, is considered by the authors to be crown-group
Neoricinulei, and used as an age constraint for the living taxa.
Even if correct, some type of justification is needed? There is potential for bias here – if the fossil
is not crown group (e.g., crown group members are more derived), then crown group age could
be younger than estimated. In this regard, I note that all other calibrations used are ancient, and
that these ancient calibrations could be biasing analyses towards older estimated divergence
times.

Rosa Fernández and Gonzalo Giribet,
This study comprises a solid and meaningful phylogenetic treatment of a vastly understudied
group that will impact our understanding of arachnid systematics and biogeography. My main
concerns with this work relate to its brevity. I feel like more could be said to introduce readers to
this poorly-studied group. Given how little is published concerning ricinulids, I would like to see
more details concerning the group, including ecology, taxonomic history, and evolutionary
relationships to other arachnids. Additionally, I would appreciate more details concerning the
methods in this text. While other works and supplemental materials detailing the methods are
cited, I think more could be added to the body of the manuscript.
Minor comments:
Line 73: Should this say 100%?
Line 209: I think this should say, “Colour codes as in Figure 1b.”
Figure 1b: The stars representing calibration points were not properly aligned in my version of
the document.

Comments to the Author(s)
Rosa Fernández and Gonzalo Giribet,
This study comprises a solid and meaningful phylogenetic
treatment of a vastly understudied group that will impact
our understanding of arachnid systematics and
biogeography. My main concerns with this work relate to its
brevity. I feel like more could be said to introduce readers
to this poorly-studied group. Given how little is published
concerning ricinulids, I would like to see more details
concerning the group, including ecology, taxonomic history,
and evolutionary relationships to other arachnids.
Additionally, I would appreciate more details concerning
the methods in this text. While other works and
supplemental materials detailing the methods are cited, I
think more could be added to the body of the manuscript.
Authors: We absolutely agree with reviewer 1. The brevity
of the manuscript is due to the fact that it was submitted
first to Biology Letters, that imposes a restriction of 2,500
words. We were then offered the possibility of transferring it
automatically to Royal Society Open Science. Being
unaware of length limitations in this new journal, we
decided not to modify the manuscript for its peer review. In
the revised version, we have extended considerably the
manuscript (particularly the introduction and material and
methods) to familiarize the readers with the taxonomic and
evolutionary history of this neglected arachnid lineage.
Minor comments:
Line 73: Should this say 100%?
Authors: corrected.
Line 209: I think this should say, “Colour codes as in Figure
1b.”
Authors: corrected.
Figure 1b: The stars representing calibration points were
not properly aligned in my version of the document.
Authors: corrected.

Comments to the Author(s)
Line 61 – The authors state that “Pseudocellus specimens
formed a single clade without much genetic
variability”. However, this statement doesn’t seem entirely
consistent with Fig S1 (e.g, split between P_102697 versus
other samples), or FIG 1 (although it’s hard to tell what
branch lengths mean in FIG 1)?. I don’t think that this issue
impacts downstream sampling design, but text accuracy
regarding the result is important. Similar claim again made
on line 99.
Authors: We agree with the reviewer and have changed the
text accordingly. It now reads ‘Pseudocellus specimens
formed a single clade with less genetic variability than
Cryptocellus or Ricinoides, while the other two genera were
subdivided into two clades each, exhibiting high genetic
variability (see Results and Discussion)’ (line 90), and
‘Pseudocellus shows more homogeneity than the other two
genera in the Sanger-based data analysis, while the
African Ricinoides and the Neotropical Cryptocellus appear
to have deep structure with two major clades each’ (line
209).
Line 66 – What is Cryptocellus sp nov (IZ-30913). In
particular, how does this relate to samples shown on the
COI tree (FIG S1)??
Authors: This new species of Cryptocellus was collected
twice in Panama. The first time was in 2013, and the
assigned catalogue numbers IZ-128904.1 (male) and IZ-
128904.2 (juvenile). The COI was sequenced in both
specimens, and their sequences are included in the COI
tree. The second time that the species was collected was
in 2014 and it was assigned the catalog number IZ-30913.
This specimen was fixed in RNAlater for RNA extraction.
We have included this information in the manuscript (lines
98-102): ‘Note that Cryptocellus sp. nov. was collected
twice and therefore appears with a different IZ number in
the COI tree (IZ128904) and the phylogenomic tree
(IZ30913). Further details can be found in the database
Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University
(MCZ)(
http://mcz.harvard.edu/collections/searchcollections.html)’.
Line 72 – Are these gene occupancy values correct?
Authors: There was a mistake: it was written 10% gene
occupancy instead of 90%. This has been corrected in the
new version of the manuscript.
Line 102 – Referring to FIG 2, the authors claim “no conflict
at the gene tree level”. However, FIG 2 suggests a near
trichotomy at the base of Ricinulei, somewhat at odds with
the topology shown in FIG 1b. Is it true that ALL of the
gene trees recover the exact same topology within
Ricinulei? Again, this issue doesn’t greatly impact the
general phylogenomic results of the paper, but the
statement seems like an oversimplification of reality.
Authors: The figures only show some gene conflict in the
position of both lineages of Ricinoides, but in any case
there is a contradiction with the general results of the
different analyses, which were all congruent. Also, we
would like to remind the reviewer that in the supernetwork
analysis conflict is shown as short branches and/or
reticulations, and the length of the branches of the three
lineages do not indicate conflict within Ricinulei.
Figure 1b – The grey star for calibration within Ricinulei is
unclear? Is this supposed to represent the base of the
crown group? Also, there are many more grey stars shown
on this figure (calibration points) than discussed in the
Supp Material (11 on figure, only 2 or 3 discussed in
text)??
Authors: More information about the calibration points has
been added to the manuscript (from line 190 on).
Figure 1b – Why are BI values > 0.9 shown as solid? It
would be more valuable and transparent to show values >
0.95.
Authors: One of the analyses showed a marginal posterior
probability value (0.92), but in most analyses the posterior
probability values were higher than 0.95.
Figure 1b – This tree must result from a particular analysis
(e.g., inference method and supermatrix), but it’s not clear
what this this?
Supplemental Material – In discussing the different
supermatrices, it would be relevant to know how much
missing data there is for the ingroup taxa.
Authors: This information is implicitly provided as we
include the percentage of gene occupancy.
Supplemental Material – In discussing the fossil
calibrations, the authors are very “casual” about the
calibration of the key Myanmar fossil. The 98 million-year-
old Myanmar fossil, described as a Palaeoricinulei by the
original authors, is considered by the authors to be crown-
group Neoricinulei, and used as an age constraint for the
living taxa.
Even if correct, some type of justification is needed? There
is potential for bias here – if the fossil is not crown group
(e.g., crown group members are more derived), then crown
group age could be younger than estimated. In this regard,
I note that all other calibrations used are ancient, and that
these ancient calibrations could be biasing analyses
towards older estimated divergence times.
Authors: We have included more information about the
calibration points in the main text (lines 167-185).
