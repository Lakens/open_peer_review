This ms aims to describe sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in Indian fossil strombids from the
Miocene. Unfortunately, the authors have no means of rejecting alternative hypotheses regarding
why the two size classes they observe exist. As such, the ms fails to meet the standards for
publication, and I recommend that it be rejected.
In order to suggest SSD, one must be able to discriminate between the sexes independently of
shell size, quantify some size difference(s) within the sample, and finally show that the size
differences discriminates between the sexes in the same manner as the independent data. The
authors identified a bimodal size distribution within their sample, but have no independent,
corroborating data that conclusively can assign the sex to individuals. Their assertion that "all
females are bigger, so all bigger snails are female" may indeed be true, but with no way to assign
sex, their data doesn't mean much. Also, there are other explanations for the observed bimodal
distribution. Micro- and macrohabitat differences, large and small genotypes, and selection due
to predation have all been shown to affect phenotype presence and distribution in gastropod
populations. The authors did not test any other hypothesis that could explain their data.
Since I recommend rejection, I did not go line by line to correct the grammar in the ms. However,
the authors are encouraged to have their English more thoroughly edited in any future
submissions/resubmissions of this work.

This article reports the first record of sexual size dimorphism in fossil Strombidae and its possible
evolutionary implications. Overall I think that this is a simple and tidy paper that discusses
interesting hypotheses about size dimorphism. In my opinion the paper fit the journal scope and
is quite well structured. I recommend the publication on the Royal Society Open Science with
revisions.
The specific comments are attached in the manuscript (Appendix A).
General comments:
- I suggest that the authors get editing help from someone with full proficiency in English.
- The manuscript (including figures and tables) needs format editing according to the journal
instructions.
- The use of some categorical adjectives to describe the results is a bit speculative (e.g.
conclusively, in all probabilities, etc.).
- The way the authors refer to the overlapping between morphs and intermediate sizes is
confusing.

Dear Dr Halder:
Manuscript ID RSOS-171755 entitled "First record of sexual size dimorphism in fossil Strombidae
(Gastropoda) from the Miocene of Kutch, western India and its evolutionary implications" which
you submitted to Royal Society Open Science, has been reviewed. The comments from reviewers
are included at the bottom of this letter.
In view of the criticisms of the reviewers, the manuscript has been rejected in its current form.
However, a new manuscript may be submitted which takes into consideration these comments.
The reviews are very divergent, making it difficult to arrive at a final decision. However, I am
swayed by the fact that in the absence of a clear means of establishing sex of fossil taxa, it is
difficult to establish sexual dimorphism. This is a valid criticism, but one common to most studies
of fossil organisms. It is something that you should address explicitly in a revised version of your
manuscript, specifically to avoid accusation of circularity. All reviewers suggest some
improvement of use of English is called for, and this should also be given priority when revising
your manuscript.
Please note that resubmitting your manuscript does not guarantee eventual acceptance, and that
your resubmission will be subject to peer review before a decision is made.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of your
manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript and upload the files via your author centre.

1. Summary
39
40 Persististrombus deperditus (Sowerby) from the lower Miocene of Kutch, Gujarat, western India is
41
42 represented by two size classes in our collection. Simple statistical analyses separate the size morphs
43
44 conclusively. The size difference presumably resulted from sexual dimorphism where the larger
45
46 morph is the female. All the living species of the family Strombidae, wherever examined, are
47
48 characterized by similar sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Other possible causes of large size variation
49
50 within a species generally occur in different populations or subpopulations. This is the first report of
51
52 SSD in a fossil strombid gastropod. Longitudinal analysis of diameter data indicates possible
53
54 involvement of positive allometry in the ontogeny of both the morphs, and neoteny in the growth of
55
56 the microconch with respect to the macroconch. It is argued that fecundity selection was the driving
57
58 force behind the evolution of SSD in this gonochoristic gastropod species.

2. Introduction
9
10 The family Strombidae is present in the Holocene exclusively in shallow tropical and sub-tropical
11
12 seas. Wherever strombid species are found they are generally quite abundant [1]. The family is
13
14 characterized by determinate growth. Once the shell attains final size it undergoes substantial change
15
16 in apertural features, such as upturned suture, often flared and thickened outer lip that sometimes
17
18 bears spines. Final shell size and shape are attained in this family before sexual maturity [2, 3].
19
20
21
22 All the living species of Strombidae are gonochoristic. All the examined species of the family exhibit
23
24 sexual dimorphism with respect to size where females are larger than males ([4] and references
25
26 therein]). Sexual size dimorphism in some recent species of Strombidae has been known for a long
27
28 time (e.g., [5-7]), and Cob et al. [8] considered it the general characteristic of the genus “Strombus”.
29
30 Size ranges of the two sexes often overlap, but members in the larger size end are generally females
31
32 whereas those in the smaller size end are males (e.g., [8]). In spite of the determinate growth and
33
34 apparent ease of recognition of adulthood because of the presence of adult apertural modifications,
35
36 sexual dimorphism has never been reported in fossil Strombidae. Dependence of palaeontological
37
38 studies solely on hard part morphologies and presence of overlapping size ranges between the sexes
39
40 might have discouraged such documentation. Here we report sexual size dimorphism in
41
42 Persististrombus deperditus (Sowerby, 1840) from the Miocene of Kutch, western India. We also seek to
43
44 understand the possible mechanism of development of dimorphism and causes of its evolution.

3. Dimorphic Persististrombus deperditus (Sowerby,
7
8
9 1840)
10
11
12 Strombus deperditus Sowerby, 1840 is known from the lower Miocene of Kutch and Pakistan [9, 10].
13
14 Harzhauser et al. [11] included it (misspelled as depertitus) in the genus Persististrombus Kronenberg &
15
16 Lee, 2007 and put Strombus nodosus Sowerby, 1840 into its synonymy. The latter comes from the same
17
18 stratigraphic level and geographic locality as it. The species is abundant in Kutch. Harzhauser et al.
19
20 [11] provided a formal systematic description of the species.
21
22
23
24 The species is fusiform, anomphalous, dextrally coiled with elevated and step like spire. The spire is
25
26 shorter than the last whorl. The last whorl overlaps about 70% of the preceding whorl. The base is
27
28 conical and extended into a short and slightly curved anterior siphonal canal. An angular shoulder
29
30 separates a moderately wide and slightly sloping shelf from the rather flat whorl side. Its surface
31
32 bears characteristic ornament having prominent spiral ribbing and shoulder tubercles. The species is
33
34 easily identifiable because of these prominent morphological features. Interestingly, it occurs in a
35
36 wide range of adult sizes in Kutch. On visual inspection they can be broadly grouped in two size
37
38 classes, which do not differ significantly in other features. The number of whorls in all the adult
39
40 specimens is about eight. The larger and the smaller size groups are referred here as the macro- and
41
42 the microconch respectively (table 1, figure 1).
43
44
45
46 The height of the largest macroconch is twice that of the smallest microconch although overlapping is
47
48 present in the size ranges of the two groups. Therefore, it is difficult to assign some specimens to
49
50 either of the groups. Hence, we have performed simple statistical analyses to see the viability of these
51
52 groups.

4. Material and methods
5
6 4.1. Material studied
7
8 The lower Miocene is represented in Kutch, Gujarat by the Khari Nadi Formation and the Chhasra
9
10 Formation [12]. The Khari Nadi Formation was deposited in the Aquitanian and the Chhasra
11
12 Formation represents the Burdigalian [13]. The succession is comprised of a thick pile of sandstone,
13
14 shale and siltstone with intervening thin layers of marl and limestone. These marl and limestone
15
16 bands are richly fossiliferous and mainly yield varieties of benthic molluscs – bivalves and
17
18 gastropods. Persististrombus deperditus is quite common at certain levels through this succession. In
19
20 this study, out of several hundred specimens in our collection we have used only 72 sub-adult to
21
22 adult specimens. These are chosen because of preservation of major parts of their apical and basal
23
24 sides so that faithful measurements can be taken. Many of these specimens are preserved with shell.
25
26 The specimens were collected randomly from three localities. The specimens come from the Khari
27
28 Nadi Formation exposed near village Aida (Loc 1: 23°24' 48.5" N, 68°48' 58" E), and Chhasra
29
30 Formation exposed about 2.5 km north of village Bhadra (Loc 2: 23°27' 47.8" N, 68°55' 34" E) and at
31
32 Kankawati River near village Vinjan (Loc 3: 23°06' N, 69°02' 52" E) (Fig. 2). All these specimens
33
34 approach adulthood, which has been confirmed using one or more of the features discussed below.
35
36
37
4.2. Methodology
38
39 The dimension of a gastropod is traditionally represented by the shell height (figure 3), especially in
40
41 the recent forms. In fossil strombids either the apex or the anterior extremity of the siphonal canal or
42
43 both are commonly broken. For this analysis we have selected specimens with relatively less
44
45 truncated ends to minimize error in the measurement of height. Still, measurement of the shell height
46
47 (H) could have incorporated some error due to reconstruction. Hence, we have also measured the
48
49 shell diameter (D) of the last whorl near the final position of aperture where the suture turns up
50
51 adapically (figure 3). Measurements were taken using a digital slide caliper and used up to two
52
53 decimal digits (table 1). Histograms were constructed with D and H data (figure 4). The data
54
55 distribution of designated macro- and microconch specimens were tested for normality by Shapiro-
56
57 Wilk test (p<0.05) (table 2). Equality of mean, variance and distribution were tested using t-, F- and
58

1
2
3 Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests respectively (p<0.05) (table 3). Normal probability plots were also
4
5 obtained for the data (figure 5). All the statistical analyses and plots were obtained using the PAST
6
7 3.12 software [14].
8
9
10
11 A longitudinal data analysis has been carried out using six well-preserved specimens where a set of
12
13 consecutive measurements of diameter at different ontogenetic stages were possible. Three
14
15 macroconch and three microconch specimens have been used. Eight diameter data have been
16
17 measured in each of the specimens. First measurement was that of the last whorl (D), which was used
18
19 in the previous analyses. Successively other measurements corresponding to earlier ontogenetic
20
21 stages were taken at 180o angular distance apart (figure 3). These eight diameter data (table 4) for each
22
23 of the specimens were plotted in a univariate space keeping early ontogenetic stage to the left (figure
24
25 6).
26
27
28
29 Representative specimens were coated with magnesium oxide before they were photographed by
30
31 Nikon D7000 DSLR and Sony RX10 III cameras (figure 1).
32
33
34
35 4.3. Determining adulthood
36
Adulthood in the family Strombidae is generally marked by an apical extension of the posterior canal
37
38
and an upturned suture. Other features commonly associated with the adult aperture in this family
39
40
are a flared and thickened outer lip having plicate interior. In Persististrombus deperditus apical
41
42
extension of the suture is relatively short and rarely crosses the preceding whorl (figure
43
44
1(b),(g),(l),(m),(s) etc., however, 1(e) for an exception). Flared outer lip with plicate interior is
45
46
preserved in only a few specimens of our collection (figure 1(b),(e)). However, here a few other
47
48
features facilitated recognition of the final size. Nearly one whorl before the final aperture strength of
49
50
the shoulder tubercles and surface ornamentation reduce considerably (figs 1(c),(i),(j)). This area,
51
52
which lies at the same level with the adult aperture, was in contact with the substrate in the living
53
54
55 individual. Apparently, this reduction of ornamentation is an adaptation for smooth movement of the
56
adult individual. This is also economical because anti-predatory ornaments were not required in this

3 part. The strength of the shoulder tubercles abruptly increases after this stage (figure
4
5 1(d),(f),(j),(n),(o),(q)). This increase is accompanied by sudden appearance of spirally arranged
6
7 tubercles at the middle of the whorl side (figure 1(d),(f),(n)–(p)). We have restricted our analysis only
8
9 to specimens where one or more of these features could be studied. Measurements were taken only
10
11 when adapical extension of the suture is observed.

17 5. Results
18
19 Visual inspection of our collection of Persististrombus deperditus from the lower Miocene of Kutch
20
21 indicated large variability in the adult shell size and the presence of broadly two size classes. The
22
23 larger size class, referred as the macroconch, has the shell diameter of about 20 mm and above, and
24
25 the shell height of 50 mm and above. The smaller size group, referred as the microconch, comprises of
26
27 individuals with D mostly less than 15 mm, and H less than 40 mm. The histograms that have been
28
29 prepared from the data of H and D broadly show two-peak distributions, thus separating the
30
31 macroconch from the microconch (figure 4). The Shapiro–Wilk test reveals that H and D for both the
32
33 macro- and the microconch specimens are distributed normally (p<0.05) (table 2). The normal
34
35
probability plots arranged the data points for both the morphs largely along the reduced major axis
36
37 regression lines, which were drawn for reference and comparison (figure 5). This also indicates
38
39
normal distribution of shell height and shell diameter for the two morphs. The probability of their
40
41
means, variances and distributions being equal appears to be negligible (p<0.05) (table 3). Because the

variances of D and H for the two morphs can be significantly different unequal variance t-test scores
44
45
are also given in the Table 3. However, p-values for both equal and unequal variance t-tests show
46
47
significant difference between the macro- and the microconch. Normal distribution, and significantly
48
49
different means, variances and distributions indicate that the macro- and the microconch specimens
50
51
represent natural populations, which differ significantly in their final diameter and height.

3 the eight ontogenetic stages of each of the six specimens are slightly concave up indicating possible
4
5 increase in the rate of growth of the diameter during ontogeny, i.e., involvement of possible
6
7 allometry. The macroconch specimens further show an acceleration of growth of the diameter over
8
9 the microconch specimens from stage four, thereby making the curve more acutely concave and
10
11 separating the macroconch group from the microconch more clearly in later ontogeny (figure 6).
12
13 There is a tendency of flattening of the curves from stage seven, which demarcates approaching
14
15 adulthood.

6. Discussion
23
24 6.1. Evolution of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in Persististrombus deperditus
25
26 All the analyses reveal significant difference in the final size between the macro- and the microconch,
27
28 which were separated by visual inspection. Size dimorphism in a gonochoristic species is generally
29
30 attributed to differences due to sexes. The size dimorphism in Persististrombus deperditus can be
31
32 considered as sexual in nature in view of the fact that SSD is present in all the living species of the
33
34 family wherever examined from this point of view. This fact prompted Cob et al. [8] to consider SSD
35
36 the general condition of the lineage. In these living species it is also characterised primarily by
37
38 difference in size between the macro- and the microconch. SSD, while known from ancient
39
40 gonochoristic prosobranch gastropods [15], is not as prevalent as in the Mesozoic ammonites
41
42 (Ammonitida, Cephalopoda) [16], and has never been reported in fossil strombids.
43
44
45
46 Intra-specific size variation is known to occur in many animals including molluscs due to other
47
48 causes. They include difference in physical conditions of the habitat or micro-habitat, e.g.,
49
50 temperature, latitude, moisture content, food availability, predation pressure, water energy etc. [17-
51
52 20]. While such size variations generally occur between geographically isolated populations of a
53
54 species significant size difference has also been reported between sub-populations separated by only
55
56 about 10m distance [19]. Johannesson et al. [19] reported wide variation in size in Littorina saxatilis
57
58 (Olivi, 1792) (Littorinidae, Gastropoda) population from Galicia. It is a direct developer species
59

2
3 having indeterminate growth that lives in the intertidal zone. They found large difference in size
4
5 between individuals living in lower shore and those in upper shore zones [19]. Molluscs lacking
6
7 planktotrophic dispersive larval ontogeny are known to display more prominent differences between
8
9 their populations in terms of size ([19] and references therein). However, strombids with
10
11 planktotrophic larval development are also known to vary significantly in size. Savazzi [2] observed
12
13 that conspecific strombids living in the intertidal zone are much smaller than those living in the
14
15 subtidal part a few tens of meters away. Within the same population, however, size varies between
16
17 20% and 30% [2].
18
19
20
21 The macro- and the microconch specimens of the present study were found to occur together in all
22
23 the sites of collection. High abundance of the species wherever it was encountered, random
24
25 orientation of its shells, presence of the specimens only in plane bedded marl and limestone indicate
26
27 that the fossils are largely autochthonous to parautochthonous. They apparently had substrate
28
29 preference and flourished in abundance whenever substrate conditions were suitable. Co-occurrence
30
31 of the two morphs in autochthony indicates that they belong to the same population. It appears that
32
33 two distinct size classes in the same population can best be explained by sexual size dimorphism.
34
35 Hence, difference in sexes appears to be the most likely reason for the development of the size
36
37 dimorphism in Persististrombus deperditus. Savazzi’s [2] observation that fossil strombids of the same
38
39 assemblage may display a size ratio of 4:1 can also include SSD.
40
41
42
43 The family Strombidae perhaps appeared in the Upper Cretaceous but became a common component
44
45 of benthic mollusc faunas in shallow tropical and sub-tropical seas only since the later part of the
46
47 Paleogene [2,3]. The present report indicates that SSD, comparable to that of the living strombids, had
48
49 appeared quite early in the history of this lineage. Another stromboid species belonging to the genus
50
51 Tibia Röding, 1798 (Rostellariidae, Stromboidea, Gastropoda) co-occurs with Persististrombus
52
53 deperditus in the lower Miocene of Kutch. It also shows large variability in adult size in spite of similar
54
55 number of whorls in the adulthood, indicating presence of possible SSD (Halder and Paira
56
57 unpublished data).

4
5 It appears from the longitudinal data analysis that the size difference between the macro- and the
6
7 microconch arose by a heterochronic process where the microconch is neotenic with respect to the
8
9 macroconch. It may be mentioned that the macro- and the microconch have similar number of whorls
10
11 and the measurements were taken at comparable growth stages with reference to their adulthood.
12
13 Hence, the neoteny that is involved in the growth of diameter of the microconch is in terms of
14
15 comparable growth stages and not necessarily with respect to age. It may further be noted here that
16
17 the heterochronic term ‘neoteny’ is used in a relative sense and does not indicate any evolutionary
18
19 direction. It is the same as ‘acceleration’ of the macroconch with respect to the growth of the
20
21 microconch.
22
23
24
25 Cob et al. [4] recorded allometry in the ontogeny of the living Laevistrombus canarium (Linneaus, 1758)
26
27 from Malaysia and difference in growth rate between the sexual variants of this species. At the age of
28
29 one year the males of the species attain a height of 48.54 mm whereas the females attain 54.54 mm.
30
31 The males of the species mature at a smaller size, and they also live slightly longer than the females
32
33 [4].
34
35
36
37 In all examined living species of Strombidae SSD is characterised by larger adult females [1,4,8,21].
38
39 Cob et al. [8] observed that while size difference between the sexes in Laevistrombus canarium is small
40
41 most of the sampled large individuals are females and small individuals are males. In the four recent
42
43 strombid species from the USA, live caught specimens of which were used for captive breeding
44
45 experiment, female shells were observed to be higher and heavier than male shells although their
46
47 ranges overlap to a great extent (see table 2 in [22]). In Persististrombus deperditus we have found
48
49 significant difference between the sizes of macro- and microconch although there is overlapping in
50
51 their size ranges. Wherever sexual consorts of a living mollusc species are observed to have
52
53 prominent difference in adult sizes, the females are usually larger [23]. Fossil molluscs including
54
55 strombids, in all likelihood, followed the same pattern of SSD. Hence, the macroconch of P. deperditus
56
57 represents, in all probability, the females.

5 It may be pertinent to mention that Cob et al. [8] reported imposex variety of Laevistrombus canarium,
6
7 which is the largest and males the smallest. Imposex is generally developed due to presence of
8
9 pollutant tributyltin (TBT) compounds [24]. TBT induced imposex has also been reported in strombid
10
11 species Lobatus gigas (Linnaeus, 1758) [25]. However, imposex has also been reported from gastropod
12
13 samples collected before the use of TBT [26]. But, majority consensus is still inclined towards a strong
14
15 correlation between TBT and imposex. It may be mentioned that trimorphism has also been reported
16
17 in the Mesozoic ammonites [16]. In species where size ranges of the two sexes differ relatively less
18
19 and have overlapping, shell character based studies often tend to distinguish an intermediate size
20
21 variety. In Persististrombus deperditus an intermediate size variety may be separated by visual
22
23 inspection and validated by some statistical means. But establishing such a biological disorder like
24
25 imposex is impossible in this nearly 20 million year old gastropod species. Further, anthropogenic
26
27 pollutants like TBT were absent in the seas of that time.
28
29
30
31 It has been observed that the macroconch of Persististrombus deperditus is considerably more abundant
32
33 than the microconch. Cob et al. [4] also observed abundance of females over males throughout the
34
35 year of study in Laevistrombus canarium from Malaysia. Disparate sex ratios are a commonplace
36
37 observation in sexually dimorphic species of ammonites, where it has been seen to vary from nearly
38
39 one to 100 in either way. There, the disparity has been attributed to seasonal segregation of the sexes
40
41 or taphonomic bias [16,27,28]. Seasonal niche partitioning between the sexes is also known in living
42
43 cephalopods [29]. It has been documented that in living strombids sexes sometimes segregate during
44
45 burial behaviour [30], which may be a part of their reproductive behaviour pattern ([31] and
46
47 references therein). At the present state of knowledge it is uncertain whether the relative abundance
48
49 of the morphs of P. deperditus is real.

53
6.2. Why dimorphism - general remarks
54
55 SSD can evolve in an organism in response to one or more of the following causes.

3 Sexual selection. A male can father more offspring than a female can bear by mating with more than
4
5 one female, thereby increasing its reproductive success but a female’s reproductive success does not
6
7 increase by mating with multiple males. This ensues in selection pressure on males. In response to
8
9 this selection pressure males either fight among themselves to win over a female or mate a female
10
11 coercively. As a consequence larger males are generally selected because strength is the key factor in
12
13 this selection [32,33]. Larger males are also commonly selected in response to this selection pressure
14
15 where epigamic choice by females is involved. There may be other responses to this selection pressure
16
17 that result in smaller males. A smaller male with higher agility and maneuverability is selected
18
19 because of greater success in search of mate, especially in fluid media [34,35]. Further, smaller males
20
21 that mature early can spend maximum energy in reproduction [36]. Such progenetic growth of the
22
23 male due to reproductive haste is common in molluscs [29,37].
24
25
26
27 Fecundity selection. Females grow to a larger size than males and often differ in body shape to
28
29 physically accommodate a large clutch of eggs. SSD in some bivalves and gastropods has been
30
31 attributed to this factor [37-39].
32
33
34
35 Niche partitioning. If males and females occupy different ecological niches - either geographically or
36
37 based on resource utilisation - occupation of the eco-space increases and intersexual competition
38
39 decreases [32,40]. As a consequence, sexes adapt and evolve independently. Dimorphism produced in
40
41 such cases is generally seen to be characterised by larger females.
42
43
44
45 Non-adaptive causes. SSD can result as a by-product of change in some other character, e.g., feeding
46
47 rates in juveniles or paedomorphic growth in one sex relative to the other [41]. It is worth mentioning
48
49 that slower feeding rate and progenetic growth with early maturity in male had been reported and
50
51 explained in adaptive terms also [42].

3 Sexual selection that selects larger males due to male-male fighting or involvement of coercion in
4
5 copulation is not known in any mollusc or any other invertebrate organism. Epigamic choice by
6
7 females is also primarily a phenomenon known in more complex groups of vertebrates. In recent
8
9 Strombidae, often several males including those that belong to different species are seen to attempt
10
11 copulation with a female individual simultaneously [43,44]. A male attempting copulation with
12
13 another male has also been observed [43,44]. Epigamic choice in such a group is almost impossible.
14
15 Small size would not provide much agility and maneuverability to a benthic crawler, like a strombid
16
17 gastropod. Although early maturity in males is common in molluscs, progenetic growth has not been
18
19 reported in males of living Strombidea. Instead, neotenic growth of the male with respect to the
20
21 female has been observed in Laevistrombus canarium [4]. The Kutch species from the Miocene
22
23 demonstrated similar possibility of neoteny of the microconch in terms of growth stages. If this also
24
25 means neoteny with respect to absolute age, then “reproductive haste” cannot be forwarded as a
26
27 driving mechanism of SSD in this case.
28
29
30
31 The larger size of the female gastropod to accommodate more eggs definitely provides higher success
32
33 in producing large number of progenies and hence fecundity selection can be a probable cause of SSD
34
35 in strombids. Cob et al. [8] also suggested that females of Laevistrombus canarium allocated more
36
37 energy to gonad production.
38
39
40
41 Ecological niche separation between males and females leading to independent adaptation and
42
43 evolution of the sexes can be a possible cause behind SSD in Persististrombus deperditus because it
44
45 separates the resource utilisation between the sexes of the species, thereby lowering intersexual
46
47 competition. This can also explain the significantly discrepant relative abundance of the morphs.
48
49 However, information on living strombids is inadequate to support this hypothesis unequivocally.
50
51 Living strombids are gregarious, and herbivorous or detritivorous in habit [2]. They commonly show
52
53 a burial behavior, during which sometimes sexes segregate [30]. But, this separation does not
54
55 adequately explain the size difference.

3 Evolution of SSD as a fabricational noise (sensu [45]), such as by paedomorphic growth of one sex
4
5 compared to the other, can only be established if such modification does not involve any adaptive
6
7 advantage. We, here, found possible involvement of a heterochronic mechanism in the evolution of
8
9 SSD in the Miocene strombid species from Kutch. But this phenomenon cannot be dissociated from
10
11 adaptive causes.
12
13
14
15 It appears from the above discussion that fecundity selection is the most plausible cause for the
16
17 evolution of SSD in Persististrombus deperditus. The only other factor that might have played some role
18
19 was niche separation between the sexes.

7. Conclusions
27
28 Sexual size dimorphism is present in all the living species of Strombidae wherever examined but was
29
30 unknown in fossil strombids. The oldest SSD in the gastropod family Strombidae is reported here in
31
32 Persististrombus deperditus from the lower Miocene of Kutch, western India. The two morphs are
33
34 distinguished mainly in the adult size, which is represented in this analysis by the shell diameter and
35
36 the shell height. The intersexual difference in the shell diameter appears to have evolved by a
37
38 heterochronic mechanism involving rate of growth leading to narrower microconchs. The SSD seems
39
40 to have served the purpose of accommodating larger clutch of eggs in the larger female. Discrepant
41
42 abundance of the sexes, if not actual, might have resulted from niche separation between the two
43
44 sexes. Appearance of SSD in such early stage of evolution of the family suggests that further
45
46 investigation may reveal more dimorphic species in this lineage.

Appendix B
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
(1) This ms aims to describe sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in Indian fossil strombids from
the Miocene. Unfortunately, the authors have no means of rejecting alternative
hypotheses regarding why the two size classes they observe exist. As such, the ms
fails to meet the standards for publication, and I recommend that it be rejected.
(2) In order to suggest SSD, one must be able to discriminate between the sexes
independently of shell size, quantify some size difference(s) within the sample, and
finally show that the size differences discriminates between the sexes in the same
manner as the independent data. The authors identified a bimodal size distribution within
their sample, but have no independent, corroborating data that conclusively can
assign the sex to individuals. Their assertion that "all females are bigger, so all bigger
snails are female" may indeed be true, but with no way to assign sex, their data doesn't
mean much. Also, there are other explanations for the observed bimodal
distribution. Micro- and macrohabitat differences, large and small genotypes, and
selection due to predation have all been shown to affect phenotype presence and
distribution in gastropod populations. The authors did not test any other hypothesis that
could explain their data.
(3) Since I recommend rejection, I did not go line by line to correct the grammar in the ms.
However, the authors are encouraged to have their English more thoroughly edited in
any future submissions/resubmissions of this work.
Authors’ response: (1) We had provided a brief discussion in the initial submission
regarding rejection of alternative hypotheses. However, it was brief. In this revised version
we have elaborated on it.
(2) Assignment of sex to individuals by some independent means is possible in the
domain of biology, but not in palaeontology. In the revised MS we have specifically
addressed this issue and taken the approach of refuting hypotheses concerning sexual
and asexual origin of the dimorphism. Asexual factors that can create size difference
between subpopulations leaving in sympatry, especially in marine molluscs, have been
reviewed. It has been found that the asexual factors are more easily refuted than the
sexual cause in the case of this strombid species.
(3) We have given care to English grammar and edited the language of the MS.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
(1) In ‘Introduction’ part the full form of ‘SSD’ already mentioned. Please replace ‘sexual
size dimorphism’ by ‘SSD’ from rest of the manuscript.
(2) Author should provide better photographs in Figure 1 for (a), (l), (n) and (o).
Authors’ response: (1) Retained the full form (sexual size dimorphism) only in the first
mention under a 1st order heading.
(2) Some of the photographs have been deleted. However, we feel, all the photographs
mentioned by the reviewer are not that bad. They might look somewhat poor in the PDF.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
(1) This article reports the first record of sexual size dimorphism in fossil Strombidae and
its possible evolutionary implications. Overall I think that this is a simple and tidy
paper that discusses interesting hypotheses about size dimorphism. In my opinion
the paper fit the journal scope and is quite well structured. I recommend the publication
on the Royal Society Open Science with revisions.
The specific comments are attached in the manuscript.
General comments:
-(2) I suggest that the authors get editing help from someone with full proficiency in
English.
-(3) The manuscript (including figures and tables) needs format editing according to the
journal instructions.
-(4) The use of some categorical adjectives to describe the results is a bit speculative
(e.g. conclusively, in all probabilities, etc.).
-(5) The way the authors refer to the overlapping between morphs and intermediate sizes
is confusing.
Authors’ response: (1) Thank you.
(2) We have made necessary editing.
(3) Made necessary changes in the figures and tables following instructions and recent
online papers published in RSOS.
(4) Made necessary changes.
(5) We agree. Deleted that part.
