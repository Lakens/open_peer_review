Dear authors,
I have read with much interest the manuscript entitled:"Salting-out assisted liquid-liquid
extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography for determination of vitamin
D3 in milk samples. But I recommend to improve your paper, in particular:
1. The introduction section is too general. For instance, there is no needs to mention in details in
which samples vitamin D3 was found. It will be enough to write generally (for e.g. food samples,
dietary supplements and biological samples, etc.). But information about SALLE should be
included, its principles and benefits. Please, transfer information about SALLE from Result and
Discussion section to Introduction one.
2. It is not clear how the conditions of HPLC separation were selected. Was performed any
optimization? Information about injection volume, run time, software should be provided.
3. Line 45 p. 4. The word “extraction” is repeated 2 times . I would recommend to change to
“SALLE procedure” or “Extraction procedure”.
4. The description of extraction procedure is not clear. How was performed experiment? What
tools were used?
5. Line 59, p. 4. It is not clear how much of vitamin C was added. Why was it necessary to prepare
vitamin C in ethanol?
6. Line 6, p. 5. Why was added formic acid?
7. In Result and Discussion section should be provided only obtained results. Line 22-46, there is
known information, which can be transferred to introduction section.
8. Preliminary study is not clear. The results of this study are not provided, just only mention the
reference.
9. Line 15, 38 p.7. The titles of these items can be change to “Effect of type of extraction solvent”,
“Effect of extraction solvent volume”.
10. Line 17-33 p. 7. A lot of a well-known information, but this is not the results of this
experiment. Here should be provided only the results of the test.
11. Line 26, p. 7. At the beginning of Results and discussion section it was mention about
magnesium sulfate, ammonium acetate (but, not only these salts can be used for phase
separation), after the effect of NaCl and ammonium sulfate was studied (line 6, p 8).
12. The coefficient of determination should contain 4 digits (line 39, p.9).
13. Please provide recovery and RSD to Table 2. From my point of view, the developed method is
not suitable for analysis milk powder 1 and 3 (from your data, RSD in this sample is about 81%),
for milk powder 3 RSD is 105.5%). How can you explain these results of analysis? What did effect
on such critical deviation? In Table 2, I would to recommend to write results in ng/g. The way of
writing of SD as 0.000 is not acceptable (liquid milk 3, liquid milk 4).
14. In section Comparison to previously reported methods, referenced should be added and in
Table 2 references should be modified according to the same references style like in the whole
text.
15. To the capture of Fig 1 should be added information about extraction conditions. Fig 3b,c (ml
and g should be mention only one time (on the scale or in the title of the axis).

The paper is written in a concise and well understood way and fit with the scope of Royal Society
Open Science. In the chapter Introduction, the authors of the work in a clear way introduced into
the subject of work and presented current knowledge on the subject. The aim of the work was
precisely defined. The Experimental chapter do not raise any objections. The discussion of the
results was carried out correctly. As well as formulated conclusions are correct.
There are only a series of comments that have been introduced in the manuscript. All remarks are

It would be good to make some changes in the manuscript:
1. page 5, line 58, Please add reference. From the method description, it is not clear, what
concentration of Vitamin C was.
2. Avoid the excess of figure numbers in all the parts of the manuscript and, specially in the tables
(for e.g. 94.4+-10.8, 113.5+-1.8).
