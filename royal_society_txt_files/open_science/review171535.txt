This is a very interesting paper that presents evidence confirming prior work that genetic kinship
between individuals often increases helping/sharing/cooperation in humans and that there is an
interaction between relative need and kinship in predicting helping/sharing/cooperation (see
below for additional references to prior work). The paper also shows a potentially interesting
interaction between distance between households and genetic kinship (but see comment below).
That said, the paper needs some additional work in terms of situating its contribution to the
existing literature and also clarifying the methods, analysis, and results in a way that a reader
could assess the analyses and interpretations. Here are the major concerns.
In the earlier checkboxes, I said 'no' for a number of things. If there were a 'sort of' box, I would
have checked that instead for all of them.
More careful review of existing literature and description of how this paper contributes to it. In
the introduction, the paper overlooks a lot of past and recent evidence from the human literature
that supports inclusive fitness explanations for costly helping (Hawkes 1983, Hooper et al. 2015,
Hackman et al. 2017, Nolin 2010, Nolin 2011), and the interaction between relative need and
genetic relatedness in shaping resource transfers (Hooper et al.). By downplaying this, it risks
overemphasizing its novelty. That doesn’t detract from it as an important confirmatory study in
a new context. The paper also briefly discusses the potential importance of non-kin relationships,
such as affines and fictive kin, but only operationalizes this as one very specific kind of non-kin
relationship (mating partners and shared children), thus ignoring other kinds of non-kin
relationships, such as friendships and other ritual relationships (Hackman et al. 2017, Hill 2014,
Hruschka 2010). Thus, it’s difficult to know how important the kin effect is in relation to other
kinds non-kin relationships in these communities. This should be included as a limitation.
Predictions: It would be helpful to more clearly outline the argument for each of the predictions,
rather than referencing the earlier literature. In some cases, the justification for these specific
predictions is not apparent given the wide range of predictors considered. For example, why not
predict an interaction of relative wealth/poverty by kinship in predicting helping (if poverty is
another proxy for relative need). Why is gift game behavior positively associated with observed
cooperation? Why should helping/sharing in one domain transfer to another?
Measuring of genetic kinship. Since genetic kinship is the primary variable of interest in the
analyses, it would be helpful to clarify in more detail how it was assessed. How many
generations back did the pedigrees go? It sounds like it was just for the present generation
(linking people by their mother’s and father’s from the census). If the genetic pedigrees are
shallow, then the analyses would really only tell us about parent-child and sibling relationships
and maybe some of the grandparent/aunt/uncle/cousin relationships. Also, what is the level of
paternity certainty in this society? To what degree are the relationships through “paternal” lines
genetic or social? Paternity certainty may be high. That would be great. It’s important clarify
that. Finally, it’s difficult to assess the effect size for relatedness. Is it scaled from R = 0 to 1? If
so, the effect size should be reported in meaningful units, such as the increased sharing among
those at relatedness 0.5, 0.25…… If the OR is currently based on R = 0 to 1, then it gives a value
for an absurd case when thinking about helping others (R = 1). Also, it would be helpful to see if
the assumption of a linear effect of relatedness is valid by examining the regression with dummy
variables (R >= 0.5, R > 0.5 to R >=0.25,….)
Distance travelled to help: Are fields close to houses or are they dispersed throughout the
3
landscape? If they are dispersed than it is difficult to interpret the spatial distance measure as
how far individuals are willing to travel to help since the location of a house within a village may
not be good indicator of how far they travel to help. A little more description of context would
help interpret this result.
Reporting descriptives and raw associations: It would be helpful to have a table of descriptives
on key variables (ideally stratified by village). Also, reporting uncontrolled bivariate associations
helps the reader understand how results change when you controlling for other important
factors.
Figures: It’s helpful that you show figures for the interactions. However, placing relatedness on
a log scale in the figures, bunches up all the lines on the left. For example, it’s nearly impossible
to inspect the interaction between need and relatedness in figure d. It would help see the results if
the x-axis used a linear scale for relatedness.
Confusing predictors & dependent variable: On lines 30-34 (page 5), the description appears to
mix together predictors and the dependent variable. Also, it would help to describe each of these
at the same level of detail as other variables. For example, does “ever gave a gift” mean ever
gave a gift in the gift game or ever gave a gift more generally?
Dealing with cross-village dyads. It’s not clear whether it is expected that there will be cross-
village social relationships. If there are, then it would be important to include a variable to
account for this (1 if dyad is in same village and 0 if they are in different village). If there is not an
expectation of relationships between villages, then it is important to treat those dyads as missing.
In either case, not appropriately accounting for this could lead to seriously biased estimates. It
would probably also be good to add a fixed effect for village and also check if village of residence
modifies any of the key effects of interest. Maybe this is already dealt with, but I couldn’t see
where.
Terminological clarity: Lots of terms are used: cooperation, costly sharing, costly cooperation.
Why not be specific by calling it uniformly labor sharing or helping? Cooperation is so
polysemous that it can confuse readers.
Finally: more details should be given about how requests for the data will be reviewed and
decided (and why it's not possible to give a suitably anonymized dataset, by removing
identifying variables, and maybe GIS).

Title: Kinship underlies costly cooperation in Mosuo villages
Summary: This paper contributes to a substantial literature on evolutionary motivations for the
formation of cooperative social relationships. The paper frames cooperation as a multi-causal
phenomenon and aims to provide new insight into the socioecological variation in these causes of
cooperation. If the authors are able to accomplish this, then the paper would succeed in
contributing something novel and instructive to an already saturated literature.
This manuscript attempts to show that the pattern of cooperation in the realm of farm labour is
strongly premised on kinship among the Mosuo of Southwest China. The finding that kinship is
important is not particularly surprising, but is well supported with the models shown in the
paper and justifies publication. The manuscript suffers from three primary weaknesses that
should be addressed prior to resubmission: (1) the description of the site (i.e., the Mosuo
population) seems out-dated and is not likely to describe the sample that was collected; (2) the
discussion is rather thin and prevents the paper from making as strong an impact as it might.
What does the Mosuo case say about cooperation more generally, if anything? Is the kinship
system of relevance for understanding why kinship might be a stronger predictor of cooperation
in this context than in other settings for example? What general inferences can be drawn about
the pattern of giving and receiving help in relation to wealth? (3) The description of methods and
analysis is not sufficient to make a clear judgment on the accuracy of the conclusions drawn.
Given the range of observed variability regarding the degree to which relatedness and reciprocity
reinforce or replace each other in network studies of cooperation (Koster 2011, Nolin 2010, Baggio
5
et al. 2016, etc.), a better understanding of how these two mechanisms interact in a particular
socioecology would be a significant advance. However, the paper is somewhat lacking in theory.
At one point the authors talk about how kinship might have varying importance to cooperation
in different societies, and even suggest that it may be more important for certain kinds of
cooperation, such as childcare, rather than for labor or food sharing. However, they do not
elaborate this kind of socioecological thinking to make predictions that are specific to the context
or to the particular measure of cooperation (labor exchange). In fact they don’t even offer a
prediction that kinship may be less important to labor cooperation, as they point out a few lines
above. A number of anthropologists have recently studied cooperation through the lens of labor
exchange (e.g. MacFarlan, Remiker, & Quinlan 2012; Downey 2010; etc.) and this, while not cited
in the current paper, would likely be informative for deriving more specific predictions.
An important improvement that this paper requires is a more detailed description of data,
sampling, and analytical methods. For an open-science venue like RSOS, transparency and
internal consistency are of critical importance, but the paper in its current iteration does not meet
these criteria. A number of major pieces of information are missing, preventing the reader from
being able to evaluate whether the design, results, and interpretation are logically consistent. For
example, it is unclear how many villages were sampled, how respondents are distributed among
villages, how 128,082 dyads were derived from 770 households, and how much overlap exists
between alters and egos (if villages weren’t comprehensively surveyed). While the conclusions
offered in this paper seem plausible and interesting, it is quite hard to tell whether they follow
logically from the methodological decisions, since it is unclear what those decisions were.
Specific Comments
Introduction
l.3-4,p.2: Is it appropriate to say that genetic relatedness causes conflict or is it more correct to say
that conflict arises among kin due to shared resources?
More generally, this section reads a bit like an undergraduate thesis with disjointed paragraphs
exploring particular hypotheses without joining them together or to the purpose of the article.
Revision to improve coherence and tighten up is recommended.
p. 3 line 21 – a number of studies also find that households with more consumers do not tend to
receive more. The authors cite Koster 2011 above, but here fail to note his finding that the
disparity in number of producers is what matters, not the number of consumers in the receiving
household. Baggio et al. 2016 point out a similar feature in their networks as well. There’s
obviously a more complicated relationship going on here, one worth parsing out with a little
more nuanced detail. This would probably generate some slightly different predictions that
would be more socioecologically grounded.
p. 3 - Predictions do not appear to follow directly from the theoretical background provided
above. These predictions are too general, providing questions that are tested in virtually every
network cooperation study, but with no clear rationale for why they should apply here. And, as
I’ve noted above, some of these predictions seem to be in clear contradiction with suggestions
made just a few paragraphs prior. It would also be helpful to number the predictions and put
them in a table in the results section to help reviewers to keep track.
p. 3 line 46 – why predict that game behavior associates with cooperation in general as opposed
to giving or receiving in particular?
Methods
l.53-54,p.3: Why cite this paper [44] to explain duolocal residence? That is a far more salient of
historical Mosuo society than it is of contemporary society. Why not cite one of the standard
6
ethnographies here, like Shih?
l.56-57,p.3: How much forest is there to prevent land expansion here? Don't the matrilineal
Mosuo reside in basins areas that have been largely deforested?
l.3-5,p.4: Yes, all of this is normatively true, though many Mosuo will now say that they are
increasingly working without much assistance from others, even in farming activities. I do not
think it is fair to say that their nutrition is worse off from the absence of wildlife. It's not a hunting
and gathering society and their fowl, pigs, etc. are as plentiful as ever.
l.10-11,p.4: I do not agree that the Sichuan Mosuo are following a 'traditional' way of life, even at
the time these data were collected. Why is it necessary to present things this way? They are
certainly more agrarian than areas more influenced by tourism but the vast majority of
individuals we spoke with there insisted that they had abandoned many of the reproductive
patterns that have characterized the Mosuo.
l.29-30,p.4: This needs some context if it is important. There were several marriage campaigns
before the 1980s that would have influenced marriage patterns. The rule of formal marriage is
most strictly applied to individuals who work for the government and many couples have
children without being officially married, even today.
p.4 line 44 - Is this a variation on the dictator game? Do they keep what’s left over? Specify this.
l.24-25,p.5: Why not use a standard dependency ratio here (i.e., including elderly dependents)?
l.22-26,p.5: Can the relative need values be anchored in something to make sense of Figure 2? 0
presumably means no dependents and 1 is 1 dependent/consumer? Would be nice to see this
clarified as it seems the majority of households have no dependents if I'm reading Figure 2
correctly.
This section, too, seems a bit disjointed. The material might be more clearly connected to the ideas
under test in this paper to keep it coherent. The 'data collection' section could be written more
completely. What were the time windows for spot observations? What kinds of labor were
considered as part of the definition? Was leisure time spent, e.g., drinking tea (or…?) considered
'laboring' in the farm? How was the economic game set up? Where was it played? Who were the
participants? Etc.?
Results
It is quite difficult to read the figures without legends and there is insufficient expansion in the
text. Does figure 1 reveal that for most villages, there is very limited relatedness among
households?
There are also a number spots where there is an apparent error. This is confusing and a bit
sloppy.
p. 6 line 4 - How does 770 households translate into 128,082 dyads? How many individuals does
this represent? What was the method for identifying and following up with individuals? Are all
the sampled individuals adults? Are these dyads parts of comprehensively-surveyed village
networks, or are they just scattered pairs of people? Do we know anything about their other
cooperation ties or even how many other people they might participate in labor cooperation
with?
Discussion
The discussion essentially provides a series of results without any real fleshing out of context or
how this might reflect on more general hypotheses and existing literature.
The paragraph beginning with "Our study complements" is a perfect example of this. The study
shows that kin are labouring on the farms of kin; couldn't this result be used to weigh in on the
debate about what patterns cooperation in different places? Why just leave the hypotheses
hanging there?
7
The paragraph beginning "theoretical models of kin selection" is also fairly tangential to what is
being described here and could be condensed or cut.
p.7 line 16 – Interesting, c.f. Nolin 2012 who also finds that wealthier households reciprocate less
and receive net positive inflows from poorer households, while poorer households come out net
negative. But why might it be happening in this context? Does it correlate with household size
(and thus the size of the land parcel leased to the family)? Are these contributions being repaid
with some other currency like food or meat or cash? Are these individuals currying favor with
wealthier households as Nolin saw?
p. 7 line 23-24 – do we know the distribution of relatedness for families and individuals who did
not provide labor cooperation? This seems like it’s illuminating just one cell in a 2x2 table.
Wouldn’t it make more sense to first compare this against the random mixing possibility using a
chi-square or something similar?
p. 7 line 51 - “our results suggest that helping is not a means of provisioning existing children”
how exactly were existing children incorporated in the analysis? It’s hardly mentioned. And is it
controlling for children of the providing individual or is it just children in the household in
general? In the context of zouhun, the distinction is quite important.
p. 7 line 53 - How does labor exchange buffer against a resource shortfall like crop failure exactly?
This doesn’t make a ton of sense, at least not without a little bit of theory. It’s certainly not trivial,
and it just doesn’t follow explicitly.
p. 8 - Limitations are too general and vague. Yes, cross-sectional data and coefficients of
relatedness are tools with limitations. But there are much more important limitations specific to
the way this study was conducted that impact on its conclusions. For example, using a within-
village subjective wealth ranking for a statistical model applied across all villages and households
at once; it is unclear how this may impact the output of the model and the interpretation that we
can draw. At first glance, it seems that this is only valid if we can assume that labor exchange
occurred only within villages. There are also a host of limitations introduced by choosing to use
only dyadic information rather than constructing whole networks from exhaustive village
censuses.
The parameter estimate for reciprocation is almost as strong as for kinship. Why de-emphasize
this result so much?

Title: Kinship underlies costly cooperation in Mosuo villages
Summary: This paper contributes to a substantial literature on evolutionary motivations for the
formation of cooperative social relationships. The paper frames cooperation as a multi-causal
phenomenon and aims to provide new insight into the socioecological variation in these causes of
cooperation. If the authors are able to accomplish this, then the paper would succeed in
contributing something novel and instructive to an already saturated literature.
This manuscript attempts to show that the pattern of cooperation in the realm of farm labour is
strongly premised on kinship among the Mosuo of Southwest China. The finding that kinship is
12
important is not particularly surprising, but is well supported with the models shown in the
paper and justifies publication. The manuscript suffers from three primary weaknesses that
should be addressed prior to resubmission: (1) the description of the site (i.e., the Mosuo
population) seems out-dated and is not likely to describe the sample that was collected; (2) the
discussion is rather thin and prevents the paper from making as strong an impact as it might.
What does the Mosuo case say about cooperation more generally, if anything? Is the kinship
system of relevance for understanding why kinship might be a stronger predictor of cooperation
in this context than in other settings for example? What general inferences can be drawn about
the pattern of giving and receiving help in relation to wealth? (3) The description of methods and
analysis is not sufficient to make a clear judgment on the accuracy of the conclusions drawn.
Given the range of observed variability regarding the degree to which relatedness and reciprocity
reinforce or replace each other in network studies of cooperation (Koster 2011, Nolin 2010, Baggio
et al. 2016, etc.), a better understanding of how these two mechanisms interact in a particular
socioecology would be a significant advance. However, the paper is somewhat lacking in theory.
At one point the authors talk about how kinship might have varying importance to cooperation
in different societies, and even suggest that it may be more important for certain kinds of
cooperation, such as childcare, rather than for labor or food sharing. However, they do not
elaborate this kind of socioecological thinking to make predictions that are specific to the context
or to the particular measure of cooperation (labor exchange). In fact they don’t even offer a
prediction that kinship may be less important to labor cooperation, as they point out a few lines
above. A number of anthropologists have recently studied cooperation through the lens of labor
exchange (e.g. MacFarlan, Remiker, & Quinlan 2012; Downey 2010; etc.) and this, while not cited
in the current paper, would likely be informative for deriving more specific predictions.
An important improvement that this paper requires is a more detailed description of data,
sampling, and analytical methods. For an open-science venue like RSOS, transparency and
internal consistency are of critical importance, but the paper in its current iteration does not meet
these criteria. A number of major pieces of information are missing, preventing the reader from
being able to evaluate whether the design, results, and interpretation are logically consistent. For
example, it is unclear how many villages were sampled, how respondents are distributed among
villages, how 128,082 dyads were derived from 770 households, and how much overlap exists
between alters and egos (if villages weren’t comprehensively surveyed). While the conclusions
offered in this paper seem plausible and interesting, it is quite hard to tell whether they follow
logically from the methodological decisions, since it is unclear what those decisions were.
Specific Comments
Introduction
l.3-4,p.2: Is it appropriate to say that genetic relatedness causes conflict or is it more correct to say
that conflict arises among kin due to shared resources?
More generally, this section reads a bit like an undergraduate thesis with disjointed paragraphs
exploring particular hypotheses without joining them together or to the purpose of the article.
Revision to improve coherence and tighten up is recommended.
p. 3 line 21 – a number of studies also find that households with more consumers do not tend to
receive more. The authors cite Koster 2011 above, but here fail to note his finding that the
disparity in number of producers is what matters, not the number of consumers in the receiving
household. Baggio et al. 2016 point out a similar feature in their networks as well. There’s
obviously a more complicated relationship going on here, one worth parsing out with a little
more nuanced detail. This would probably generate some slightly different predictions that
would be more socioecologically grounded.
13
p. 3 - Predictions do not appear to follow directly from the theoretical background provided
above. These predictions are too general, providing questions that are tested in virtually every
network cooperation study, but with no clear rationale for why they should apply here. And, as
I’ve noted above, some of these predictions seem to be in clear contradiction with suggestions
made just a few paragraphs prior. It would also be helpful to number the predictions and put
them in a table in the results section to help reviewers to keep track.
p. 3 line 46 – why predict that game behavior associates with cooperation in general as opposed
to giving or receiving in particular?
Methods
l.53-54,p.3: Why cite this paper [44] to explain duolocal residence? That is a far more salient of
historical Mosuo society than it is of contemporary society. Why not cite one of the standard
ethnographies here, like Shih?
l.56-57,p.3: How much forest is there to prevent land expansion here? Don't the matrilineal
Mosuo reside in basins areas that have been largely deforested?
l.3-5,p.4: Yes, all of this is normatively true, though many Mosuo will now say that they are
increasingly working without much assistance from others, even in farming activities. I do not
think it is fair to say that their nutrition is worse off from the absence of wildlife. It's not a hunting
and gathering society and their fowl, pigs, etc. are as plentiful as ever.
l.10-11,p.4: I do not agree that the Sichuan Mosuo are following a 'traditional' way of life, even at
the time these data were collected. Why is it necessary to present things this way? They are
certainly more agrarian than areas more influenced by tourism but the vast majority of
individuals we spoke with there insisted that they had abandoned many of the reproductive
patterns that have characterized the Mosuo.
l.29-30,p.4: This needs some context if it is important. There were several marriage campaigns
before the 1980s that would have influenced marriage patterns. The rule of formal marriage is
most strictly applied to individuals who work for the government and many couples have
children without being officially married, even today.
p.4 line 44 - Is this a variation on the dictator game? Do they keep what’s left over? Specify this.
l.24-25,p.5: Why not use a standard dependency ratio here (i.e., including elderly dependents)?
l.22-26,p.5: Can the relative need values be anchored in something to make sense of Figure 2? 0
presumably means no dependents and 1 is 1 dependent/consumer? Would be nice to see this
clarified as it seems the majority of households have no dependents if I'm reading Figure 2
correctly.
This section, too, seems a bit disjointed. The material might be more clearly connected to the ideas
under test in this paper to keep it coherent. The 'data collection' section could be written more
completely. What were the time windows for spot observations? What kinds of labor were
considered as part of the definition? Was leisure time spent, e.g., drinking tea (or…?) considered
'laboring' in the farm? How was the economic game set up? Where was it played? Who were the
participants? Etc.?
Results
It is quite difficult to read the figures without legends and there is insufficient expansion in the
text. Does figure 1 reveal that for most villages, there is very limited relatedness among
households?
There are also a number spots where there is an apparent error. This is confusing and a bit
sloppy.
p. 6 line 4 - How does 770 households translate into 128,082 dyads? How many individuals does
14
this represent? What was the method for identifying and following up with individuals? Are all
the sampled individuals adults? Are these dyads parts of comprehensively-surveyed village
networks, or are they just scattered pairs of people? Do we know anything about their other
cooperation ties or even how many other people they might participate in labor cooperation
with?
Discussion
The discussion essentially provides a series of results without any real fleshing out of context or
how this might reflect on more general hypotheses and existing literature.
The paragraph beginning with "Our study complements" is a perfect example of this. The study
shows that kin are labouring on the farms of kin; couldn't this result be used to weigh in on the
debate about what patterns cooperation in different places? Why just leave the hypotheses
hanging there?
The paragraph beginning "theoretical models of kin selection" is also fairly tangential to what is
being described here and could be condensed or cut.
p.7 line 16 – Interesting, c.f. Nolin 2012 who also finds that wealthier households reciprocate less
and receive net positive inflows from poorer households, while poorer households come out net
negative. But why might it be happening in this context? Does it correlate with household size
(and thus the size of the land parcel leased to the family)? Are these contributions being repaid
with some other currency like food or meat or cash? Are these individuals currying favor with
wealthier households as Nolin saw?
p. 7 line 23-24 – do we know the distribution of relatedness for families and individuals who did
not provide labor cooperation? This seems like it’s illuminating just one cell in a 2x2 table.
Wouldn’t it make more sense to first compare this against the random mixing possibility using a
chi-square or something similar?
p. 7 line 51 - “our results suggest that helping is not a means of provisioning existing children”
how exactly were existing children incorporated in the analysis? It’s hardly mentioned. And is it
controlling for children of the providing individual or is it just children in the household in
general? In the context of zouhun, the distinction is quite important.
p. 7 line 53 - How does labor exchange buffer against a resource shortfall like crop failure exactly?
This doesn’t make a ton of sense, at least not without a little bit of theory. It’s certainly not trivial,
and it just doesn’t follow explicitly.
p. 8 - Limitations are too general and vague. Yes, cross-sectional data and coefficients of
relatedness are tools with limitations. But there are much more important limitations specific to
the way this study was conducted that impact on its conclusions. For example, using a within-
village subjective wealth ranking for a statistical model applied across all villages and households
at once; it is unclear how this may impact the output of the model and the interpretation that we
can draw. At first glance, it seems that this is only valid if we can assume that labor exchange
occurred only within villages. There are also a host of limitations introduced by choosing to use
only dyadic information rather than constructing whole networks from exhaustive village
censuses.
The parameter estimate for reciprocation is almost as strong as for kinship. Why de-emphasize
this result so much?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have done a good job of addressing my earlier comments. Now that I have a better
idea of how they conducted the analyses and are interpreting results, I have a few additional
concerns (mostly minor) that should be easily addressed.
First, it would be much easier to interpret the results and compare with others studies using
similar variables if the results are also presented in meaningful units (when possible). For
example, the increased odds of helping if the coefficient of relatedness between households is 0.5
vs. 0, the increased odds of helping if there was help in the opposite direction (reciprocity), the
increased odds of help if the households share a child,… . I understand the impetus to normalize
by standard deviations, to provide some kind of uniform comparison across variables, but that
comparability is somewhat illusory and depends on reliability, range restrictions of measures,
distribution of predictors, and other aspects of a specific study's design design (see Baguley 2009
below). One of these analyses (either unstandardized or standardized) should be included in SM.
Also, to increase transparency, the authors should report in the article the clarifications about
Paternity certainty in this context and how it might affect interpretations of coefficient of
relatedness.
16
Minor point:
1) It was difficult to find how you operationalized affines. Please clarify in the methods section.
2) “each of these theories drive human sociality”. Theories don’t drive behavior. Theories
predict, explain, describe human behavior.
3) When reporting odds ratios and other statistics, try to use a reasonable and uniform level of
precision. 1 decimal place is probably sufficient, but 2 decimal places would be OK too, if you
prefer.
4) Please give units in which distance is measured for table 2.
5) It would help to give mean gifts and mean help provided and received by household in table 2.
(not just mode).
6) Is the probability of helping a household with R = 0.25 and no help reciprocated really nearly 1
(100%) as indicated in the sigmoid figure b?
7) The correlation table would be more informative, if it reported the correlation coefficients in
the entries and then marked significance in some other way.
8) Why is interaction between child presence and relatedness reported in main text, when it does
not appear in the best fitting model described in the table.
9) To organize the disparate findings, it would be helpful to include the findings for support for
or against each of the hypotheses in table 1.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very interesting paper that presents evidence confirming prior work that genetic kinship
between individuals often increases helping/sharing/cooperation in humans and that there is an
interaction between relative need and kinship in predicting helping/sharing/cooperation (see below for
additional references to prior work). The paper also shows a potentially interesting interaction between
distance between households and genetic kinship (but see comment below). That said, the paper needs
some additional work in terms of situating its contribution to the existing literature and also clarifying
the methods, analysis, and results in a way that a reader could assess the analyses and interpretations.
Here are the major concerns.
In the earlier checkboxes, I said 'no' for a number of things. If there were a 'sort of' box, I would have
checked that instead for all of them.
More careful review of existing literature and description of how this paper contributes to it. In the
introduction, the paper overlooks a lot of past and recent evidence from the human literature that
supports inclusive fitness explanations for costly helping (Hawkes 1983, Hooper et al. 2015, Hackman et
al. 2017, Nolin 2010, Nolin 2011), and the interaction between relative need and genetic relatedness in
shaping resource transfers (Hooper et al.). By downplaying this, it risks overemphasizing its novelty.
That doesn’t detract from it as an important confirmatory study in a new context.
RESPONSE: Thank-you for useful comments throughout. We have added the majority of these
suggested citations and more to the Introduction. See e.g. page 3 lines 6-7,
The paper also briefly discusses the potential importance of non-kin relationships, such as affines and
fictive kin, but only operationalizes this as one very specific kind of non-kin relationship (mating partners
and shared children), thus ignoring other kinds of non-kin relationships, such as friendships and other
ritual relationships (Hackman et al. 2017, Hill 2014, Hruschka 2010). Thus, it’s difficult to know how
important the kin effect is in relation to other kinds non-kin relationships in these communities. This
should be included as a limitation.
RESPONSE: We have added this point to our discussion of limitations and cited the suggested papers
(page 8 lines 30-32).
Predictions: It would be helpful to more clearly outline the argument for each of the predictions, rather
than referencing the earlier literature. In some cases, the justification for these specific predictions is not
apparent given the wide range of predictors considered. For example, why not predict an interaction of
relative wealth/poverty by kinship in predicting helping (if poverty is another proxy for relative need).
Why is gift game behavior positively associated with observed cooperation? Why should helping/sharing
in one domain transfer to another?
RESPONSE: To more clearly outline our arguments for each prediction, we have now integrated them
into the relevant parts of the Introduction and also collated the predictions into a numbered list in new
Table 1 and referred to them in the relevant parts of the Results section. To answer the reviewer’s
specific questions, we did not use relative wealth as a proxy for relative need because it is a more
subjective measure compared to the producer:consumer ratio. We have removed the prediction about
the association between game behaviour and observed behaviour, although it remains a discussion point
later in the paper.
Measuring of genetic kinship. Since genetic kinship is the primary variable of interest in the analyses, it
would be helpful to clarify in more detail how it was assessed. How many generations back did the
pedigrees go? It sounds like it was just for the present generation (linking people by their mother’s and
father’s from the census). If the genetic pedigrees are shallow, then the analyses would really only tell
us about parent-child and sibling relationships and maybe some of the grandparent/aunt/uncle/cousin
relationships.
RESPONSE: The pedigree goes back multiple generations, up to four. Data were collected by identifying
parents (including old people identifying their parents). We have clarified this on page 4 line 29.
Also, what is the level of paternity certainty in this society? To what degree are the relationships through
“paternal” lines genetic or social? Paternity certainty may be high. That would be great. It’s important
clarify that.
RESPONSE: We do not know paternity certainty but it seems not to be especially high: 20% of women
had reported offspring by more than one partner; we do not have genetic measures.
Finally, it’s difficult to assess the effect size for relatedness. Is it scaled from R = 0 to 1? If so, the effect
size should be reported in meaningful units, such as the increased sharing among those at relatedness
0.5, 0.25…… If the OR is currently based on R = 0 to 1, then it gives a value for an absurd case when
thinking about helping others (R = 1). Also, it would be helpful to see if the assumption of a linear effect
of relatedness is valid by examining the regression with dummy variables (R >= 0.5, R > 0.5 to R
>=0.25,….)
RESPONSE: Relatedness is a continuous variable with values between 0 and 0.5 that was scaled over
two standard deviations, as were our other predictors, to have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0.5.
Scaling in this manner allows direct comparison of effect sizes between continuous and binary predictors
within models (Gelman 2008). Interpreting the probability of help received given an effect size of scaled
r = 1 does not imply an ‘absurd case’ of helping genetic clones; it refers to the probability of help
received when relatedness increases by half a standard deviation. To aid interpretability, we presented
back-transformed predictions in Figure 4.
As suggested, we re-fitted the models with dummy variables for relatedness. Using this approach, we
were not able to fit all model specifications; however, the overall relationship between relatedness and
farm help remained the same. We have included the R code to fit the dummy variable models along with
code to reproduce the rest of our analyses.
Distance travelled to help: Are fields close to houses or are they dispersed throughout the landscape? If
they are dispersed than it is difficult to interpret the spatial distance measure as how far individuals are
willing to travel to help since the location of a house within a village may not be good indicator of how
far they travel to help. A little more description of context would help interpret this result.
RESPONSE: Fields are normally fairly close to houses; thus, our distance measure is indicative of people
travelling in order to help. We have added a note to this effect on page 5, line 13-14.
Reporting descriptives and raw associations: It would be helpful to have a table of descriptives on key
variables (ideally stratified by village). Also, reporting uncontrolled bivariate associations helps the
reader understand how results change when you controlling for other important factors.
RESPONSE: We have now reported descriptives stratified by village in new Table 2 and included a plot of
bivariate correlations for our predictors (new Figure 2).
Figures: It’s helpful that you show figures for the interactions. However, placing relatedness on a log
scale in the figures, bunches up all the lines on the left. For example, it’s nearly impossible to inspect
the interaction between need and relatedness in figure d. It would help see the results if the x-axis used
a linear scale for relatedness.
RESPONSE: We have modified the figure to show interactions on a linear scale.
Confusing predictors & dependent variable: On lines 30-34 (page 5), the description appears to mix
together predictors and the dependent variable. Also, it would help to describe each of these at the
same level of detail as other variables. For example, does “ever gave a gift” mean ever gave a gift in the
gift game or ever gave a gift more generally?
RESPONSE: We have changed ‘predictors’ to ‘variables’ (page 5, line 25). “Ever gave a gift” refers to the
gift game only; we have clarified this in the text and added more to the descriptions of the other binary
variables (page 5, lines 27-31).
Dealing with cross-village dyads. It’s not clear whether it is expected that there will be cross-village
social relationships. If there are, then it would be important to include a variable to account for this (1 if
dyad is in same village and 0 if they are in different village). If there is not an expectation of
relationships between villages, then it is important to treat those dyads as missing. In either case, not
appropriately accounting for this could lead to seriously biased estimates. It would probably also be good
to add a fixed effect for village and also check if village of residence modifies any of the key effects of
interest. Maybe this is already dealt with, but I couldn’t see where.
RESPONSE: We only included within-village dyads in our analyses; we’ve added a note to this effect
(page 5, line 24). We have also re-analysed our data with a fixed effect for village, as suggested (see
Figure 3).
Terminological clarity: Lots of terms are used: cooperation, costly sharing, costly cooperation. Why not
be specific by calling it uniformly labor sharing or helping? Cooperation is so polysemous that it can
confuse readers.
RESPONSE: This is a good point. We have kept the term ‘costly cooperation’ in the paper’s title because
it will be familiar to the majority of readers and distinguishes our paper from those that do not
investigate costly forms of cooperation.
Finally: more details should be given about how requests for the data will be reviewed and decided (and
why it's not possible to give a suitably anonymized dataset, by removing identifying variables, and
maybe GIS).
RESPONSE: The small size of the communities means that the need to preserve anonymity makes it not
possible to reveal certain covariates (such family size). We have, however, produced a dataset without
household-level covariates or village identifies and uploaded this to Dryad.

Title: Kinship underlies costly cooperation in Mosuo villages
Summary: This paper contributes to a substantial literature on evolutionary motivations for the
formation of cooperative social relationships. The paper frames cooperation as a multi-causal
phenomenon and aims to provide new insight into the socioecological variation in these causes of
cooperation. If the authors are able to accomplish this, then the paper would succeed in contributing
something novel and instructive to an already saturated literature.
This manuscript attempts to show that the pattern of cooperation in the realm of farm labour is strongly
premised on kinship among the Mosuo of Southwest China. The finding that kinship is important is not
particularly surprising, but is well supported with the models shown in the paper and justifies
publication. The manuscript suffers from three primary weaknesses that should be addressed prior to
resubmission: (1) the description of the site (i.e., the Mosuo population) seems out-dated and is not
likely to describe the sample that was collected; (2) the discussion is rather thin and prevents the paper
from making as strong an impact as it might. What does the Mosuo case say about cooperation more
generally, if anything? Is the kinship system of relevance for understanding why kinship might be a
stronger predictor of cooperation in this context than in other settings for example? What general
inferences can be drawn about the pattern of giving and receiving help in relation to wealth? (3) The
description of methods and analysis is not sufficient to make a clear judgment on the accuracy of the
conclusions drawn.
RESPONSE: We respond to these points in more detail below.
Given the range of observed variability regarding the degree to which relatedness and reciprocity
reinforce or replace each other in network studies of cooperation (Koster 2011, Nolin 2010, Baggio et al.
2016, etc.), a better understanding of how these two mechanisms interact in a particular socioecology
would be a significant advance. However, the paper is somewhat lacking in theory. At one point the
authors talk about how kinship might have varying importance to cooperation in different societies, and
even suggest that it may be more important for certain kinds of cooperation, such as childcare, rather
than for labor or food sharing. However, they do not elaborate this kind of socioecological thinking to
make predictions that are specific to the context or to the particular measure of cooperation (labor
exchange). In fact they don’t even offer a prediction that kinship may be less important to labor
cooperation, as they point out a few lines above. A number of anthropologists have recently studied
cooperation through the lens of labor exchange (e.g. MacFarlan, Remiker, & Quinlan 2012; Downey
2010; etc.) and this, while not cited in the current paper, would likely be informative for deriving more
specific predictions.
RESPONSE: Given our paper is a contribution to a special issue about inclusive fitness, we decided to
focus our theoretical and empirical discussions, as well as our predictions, on that area. The reviewer is
quite right to point out that there are other approaches one could take and many alternative hypotheses
to form. However, for the sake of space and clarity, we chose to keep mainly to the focus of the special
issue.
We already cited several anthropologists who have studied cooperation through the lens of labour
exchange: see refs 27, 36, 39 and 40 in our original manuscript. We thank the reviewer for bringing
these additional manuscripts to our attention. As our study does not have the data to speak to
hypotheses about competitive altruism, we have included MacFarlan et al. (2012) in our Discussion
(page 7 lines 22-24) rather than complicating the Introduction. However, we have amended our
hypothesis about reciprocity (H4; Table 1) in light of the paper we cite re: labour exchange.
An important improvement that this paper requires is a more detailed description of data, sampling, and
analytical methods. For an open-science venue like RSOS, transparency and internal consistency are of
critical importance, but the paper in its current iteration does not meet these criteria. A number of major
pieces of information are missing, preventing the reader from being able to evaluate whether the design,
results, and interpretation are logically consistent. For example, it is unclear how many villages were
sampled, how respondents are distributed among villages, how 128,082 dyads were derived from 770
households, and how much overlap exists between alters and egos (if villages weren’t comprehensively
surveyed). While the conclusions offered in this paper seem plausible and interesting, it is quite hard to
tell whether they follow logically from the methodological decisions, since it is unclear what those
decisions were.
RESPONSE: Among other changes, we have now included a table of descriptive statistics (new Table 1),
expanded the descriptions of data, sampling and analytical methods, and included anonymised data to
enable others to reproduce our findings. Table 1 and the accompanying description explains how we
derived 128,082 dyads from the comprehensive survey of 770 households in the study villages.
Specific Comments
Introduction
l.3-4,p.2: Is it appropriate to say that genetic relatedness causes conflict or is it more correct to say that
conflict arises among kin due to shared resources?
RESPONSE: We did intend to say that genetic relatedness causes conflict. We have modified the
sentence to read: “While such assortment can select for cooperation, under some circumstances such as
shared resources or limited mates, genetic relatives might also compete [3]” (page 2 line 1-2).
More generally, this section reads a bit like an undergraduate thesis with disjointed paragraphs exploring
particular hypotheses without joining them together or to the purpose of the article. Revision to improve
coherence and tighten up is recommended.
RESPONSE: This paper is a contribution to a special issue about “debating inclusive fitness”, which is
why we have taken a broader approach with our introduction and hypotheses. We describe particular
mechanisms in their own paragraphs before joining them together starting in the paragraph beginning
on page 2 line 29 and finishing the Introduction by explicitly discussing how our contribution relates to
the literature. We stand by this approach. We have now, however, included our predictions within the
body of the Introduction rather than separately at the end (see further discussion of this point below).
p. 3 line 21 – a number of studies also find that households with more consumers do not tend to receive
more. The authors cite Koster 2011 above, but here fail to note his finding that the disparity in number
of producers is what matters, not the number of consumers in the receiving household. Baggio et al.
2016 point out a similar feature in their networks as well. There’s obviously a more complicated
relationship going on here, one worth parsing out with a little more nuanced detail. This would probably
generate some slightly different predictions that would be more socioecologically grounded.
RESPONSE: Koster explicitly states in a follow-up paper (Koster and Leckie 2014) that the results in
Koster 2011 have been superseded. This is why we do not note the finding about disparity in number of
producers.
p. 3 - Predictions do not appear to follow directly from the theoretical background provided above. These
predictions are too general, providing questions that are tested in virtually every network cooperation
study, but with no clear rationale for why they should apply here. And, as I’ve noted above, some of
these predictions seem to be in clear contradiction with suggestions made just a few paragraphs prior. It
would also be helpful to number the predictions and put them in a table in the results section to help
reviewers to keep track.
RESPONSE: Following comments from both reviewers, we have now integrated our predictions into the
main text of the Introduction, collated them in a numbered list in new Table 1, and referred to them
throughout the Results section. Our aim with this paper is to produce (quoting the other reviewer) “an
important confirmatory study in a new context.” This is why we test these more general hypotheses
derived from studies of people in other communities and societies; it should not need justifying why this
is a valuable pursuit.
p. 3 line 46 – why predict that game behavior associates with cooperation in general as opposed to
giving or receiving in particular?
RESPONSE: We have removed this prediction, although we have kept this association as a discussion
point pertaining to the issue of external validity of economic games.
Methods
l.53-54,p.3: Why cite this paper [44] to explain duolocal residence? That is a far more salient of
historical Mosuo society than it is of contemporary society. Why not cite one of the standard
ethnographies here, like Shih?
RESPONSE: Reference [44] (Ji et al 2016; now ref [49]) is a contemporary study of the same site at the
same time of data collection, not a historical study of Mosuo society. We have also added a citation to
Shih here [47].
l.56-57,p.3: How much forest is there to prevent land expansion here? Don't the matrilineal Mosuo
reside in basins areas that have been largely deforested?
RESPONSE: Sentence deleted.
l.3-5,p.4: Yes, all of this is normatively true, though many Mosuo will now say that they are increasingly
working without much assistance from others, even in farming activities. I do not think it is fair to say
that their nutrition is worse off from the absence of wildlife. It's not a hunting and gathering society and
their fowl, pigs, etc. are as plentiful as ever.
RESPONSE: Sentence deleted.
l.10-11,p.4: I do not agree that the Sichuan Mosuo are following a 'traditional' way of life, even at the
time these data were collected. Why is it necessary to present things this way? They are certainly more
agrarian than areas more influenced by tourism but the vast majority of individuals we spoke with there
insisted that they had abandoned many of the reproductive patterns that have characterized the Mosuo.
RESPONSE: We have added the caveat ‘many’ and changed ‘traditional’ to ‘duolocal’. Our previous work
Ref. [45] quantifies exactly how many are of which marriage type over the study period in these villages
and it is not true that the vast majority are not duolocal.
l.29-30,p.4: This needs some context if it is important. There were several marriage campaigns before
the 1980s that would have influenced marriage patterns. The rule of formal marriage is most strictly
applied to individuals who work for the government and many couples have children without being
officially married, even today.
RESPONSE: Added ‘for most people’.
p.4 line 44 - Is this a variation on the dictator game? Do they keep what’s left over? Specify this.
RESPONSE: This is a common game used in a number of other studies, such as Apicella et al.,
Chaudhary et al., Glowacki et al. and Thomas et al. (2016; forthcoming in Royal Society Open Science).
It is a variant of the dictator game only as far as it involves a one-way transaction. However, in the gift
game the givers choose who gets to receive how much of their endowment. Players must give
everything away; they cannot keep anything for themselves. We have clarified this in the manuscript
(page 4 lines 30-36).
l.24-25,p.5: Why not use a standard dependency ratio here (i.e., including elderly dependents)?
RESPONSE: We don’t know who the elderly dependents are as most people continue to work into old
age, especially women.
l.22-26,p.5: Can the relative need values be anchored in something to make sense of Figure 2? 0
presumably means no dependents and 1 is 1 dependent/consumer? Would be nice to see this clarified as
it seems the majority of households have no dependents if I'm reading Figure 2 correctly.
RESPONSE: The relative need values are anchored at 1 since it is a ratio of producers:consumers, as we
specified in the figure’s caption. We also stated what it means to have a relative need > 1.
This section, too, seems a bit disjointed. The material might be more clearly connected to the ideas
under test in this paper to keep it coherent. The 'data collection' section could be written more
completely. What were the time windows for spot observations? What kinds of labor were considered as
part of the definition? Was leisure time spent, e.g., drinking tea (or…?) considered 'laboring' in the farm?
How was the economic game set up? Where was it played? Who were the participants? Etc.?
RESPONSE: We have added more details in the main text. See ‘Data Collection’ section.
Results
It is quite difficult to read the figures without legends and there is insufficient expansion in the text.
Does figure 1 reveal that for most villages, there is very limited relatedness among households?
RESPONSE: The figure 1 caption says that coloured bars refer to different villages; since we do not go
into detail about specific villages beyond this, the actual colours do not matter and no legend is required.
Figure 1 shows that the majority of households are unrelated, approximately 3400 household dyads are
related up to r = 0.125 and 419 households are related at r >= 0.125. The log scale potentially
obfuscates this so we have replaced this figure with Table 3.
Figures 2 and 3 do not require legends. Figure 4 already includes a legend.
There are also a number spots where there is an apparent error. This is confusing and a bit sloppy.
RESPONSE: We are not sure what the reviewer is referring to here.
p. 6 line 4 - How does 770 households translate into 128,082 dyads? How many individuals does this
represent? What was the method for identifying and following up with individuals? Are all the sampled
individuals adults? Are these dyads parts of comprehensively-surveyed village networks, or are they just
scattered pairs of people? Do we know anything about their other cooperation ties or even how many
other people they might participate in labor cooperation with?
RESPONSE: We have added a table of descriptive statistics (Table 1) and a note explaining how we
derived the number of dyads (page 6 lines 2-5). The dyads are formed of households, not individuals;
networks include all households. For this study, we know how many times members of a given
household helped on another household’s farm, which is why we do not present data on how many other
people they might participate in labour cooperation with.
Discussion
The discussion essentially provides a series of results without any real fleshing out of context or how this
might reflect on more general hypotheses and existing literature.
RESPONSE: The second paragraph onwards of our discussion explicitly links our results to the wider
empirical and theoretical literature. Following suggestions from both reviewers, we have expanded the
discussion; see below for further details.
The paragraph beginning with "Our study complements" is a perfect example of this. The study shows
that kin are labouring on the farms of kin; couldn't this result be used to weigh in on the debate about
what patterns cooperation in different places? Why just leave the hypotheses hanging there?
RESPONSE: We have deleted this paragraph and weighed in on the debate about what patterns
cooperation in other places in the discussion.
The paragraph beginning "theoretical models of kin selection" is also fairly tangential to what is being
described here and could be condensed or cut.
RESPONSE: This relates to the theme of the special issue, which is about reconciling theoretical and
empirical studies of inclusive fitness, and thus is relevant to include.
p.7 line 16 – Interesting, c.f. Nolin 2012 who also finds that wealthier households reciprocate less and
receive net positive inflows from poorer households, while poorer households come out net negative. But
why might it be happening in this context? Does it correlate with household size (and thus the size of
the land parcel leased to the family)? Are these contributions being repaid with some other currency like
food or meat or cash? Are these individuals currying favor with wealthier households as Nolin saw?
RESPONSE: We didn’t collect verbal data on why some-one helps someone else. We only have the
quantitative data, which shows that larger households received and gave more help. That help is mainly
reciprocal of course, as discussed in the results section. However, we have no evidence that
contributions were repaid in other currencies – it seems reciprocation is all that is expected.
p. 7 line 23-24 – do we know the distribution of relatedness for families and individuals who did not
provide labor cooperation? This seems like it’s illuminating just one cell in a 2x2 table. Wouldn’t it make
more sense to first compare this against the random mixing possibility using a chi-square or something
similar?
RESPONSE: A chi-square test would not take the interdependencies among households into account,
hence why we conducted a dyadic analysis.
p. 7 line 51 - “our results suggest that helping is not a means of provisioning existing children” how
exactly were existing children incorporated in the analysis? It’s hardly mentioned. And is it controlling for
children of the providing individual or is it just children in the household in general? In the context of
zouhun, the distinction is quite important.
RESPONSE: We mention how existing children were incorporated into the analysis on page 5, line 30.
p. 7 line 53 - How does labor exchange buffer against a resource shortfall like crop failure exactly? This
doesn’t make a ton of sense, at least not without a little bit of theory. It’s certainly not trivial, and it just
doesn’t follow explicitly.
RESPONSE: We meant this in the sense that households who do not have a deficit in resources might
share any surplus with people who helped on their farms. We have removed this.
p. 8 - Limitations are too general and vague. Yes, cross-sectional data and coefficients of relatedness are
tools with limitations. But there are much more important limitations specific to the way this study was
conducted that impact on its conclusions. For example, using a within-village subjective wealth ranking
for a statistical model applied across all villages and households at once; it is unclear how this may
impact the output of the model and the interpretation that we can draw. At first glance, it seems that
this is only valid if we can assume that labor exchange occurred only within villages. There are also a
host of limitations introduced by choosing to use only dyadic information rather than constructing whole
networks from exhaustive village censuses.
RESPONSE: The statistical model was fitted to within-village dyads, hence the wealth ranking is valid to
include in these models. We have clarified this on page 5 line 24. We do not include only dyadic
information: our analyses include household-level variables such as number of residents and
producer:consumer ratios. We present a social network analysis of the sort the reviewer is presumably
thinking in a companion paper: Mace et al. (forthcoming in Nature Human Behaviour).
The parameter estimate for reciprocation is almost as strong as for kinship. Why de-emphasize this
result so much?
RESPONSE: The effect size for kinship (OR = 2.604; 95% CI [2.4, 2.826]) is 77% larger than that for
reciprocity (OR = 1.473; 95% CI [1.382, 1.570]). The sizes of ego and alter households also have larger
effect sizes than reciprocity. We highlight this result in the first paragraph of the Discussion.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have done a good job of addressing my earlier comments. Now that I have a better idea of
how they conducted the analyses and are interpreting results, I have a few additional concerns (mostly
minor) that should be easily addressed.
First, it would be much easier to interpret the results and compare with others studies using similar
variables if the results are also presented in meaningful units (when possible). For example, the
increased odds of helping if the coefficient of relatedness between households is 0.5 vs. 0, the increased
odds of helping if there was help in the opposite direction (reciprocity), the increased odds of help if the
households share a child,… . I understand the impetus to normalize by standard deviations, to provide
some kind of uniform comparison across variables, but that comparability is somewhat illusory and
depends on reliability, range restrictions of measures, distribution of predictors, and other aspects of a
specific study's design design (see Baguley 2009 below). One of these analyses (either unstandardized
or standardized) should be included in SM.
Response: We now present unstandardized log odds in the main text of the Results section alongside
standardised odds ratios in Figure 3.
Also, to increase transparency, the authors should report in the article the clarifications about Paternity
certainty in this context and how it might affect interpretations of coefficient of relatedness.
Response: We have added the clarification to page 5, lines 22-24.
Minor point:
1) It was difficult to find how you operationalized affines. Please clarify in the methods section.
Response: On page 4, line 39, we stated that we collected names of spouses; these are the affines. For
additional clarify, we have also added “Affinal networks were constructed based on the names and
households of individuals’ spouses and aggregated at the household level” to the Data Preparation
section (page 5 line 24-25).
2) “each of these theories drive human sociality”. Theories don’t drive behavior. Theories predict,
explain, describe human behavior.
Response: We have changed ‘drive’ to ‘explains’ (page 1, line 22)
3) When reporting odds ratios and other statistics, try to use a reasonable and uniform level of
precision. 1 decimal place is probably sufficient, but 2 decimal places would be OK too, if you prefer.
Response: As far as we could see, we consistently reported all statistics to three decimal places
throughout the manuscript – a common level of precision in evolutionary anthropology.
4) Please give units in which distance is measured for table 2.
Response: Added ‘km’ to the table.
5) It would help to give mean gifts and mean help provided and received by household in table 2.
(not just mode).
Response: Median number of gifts and amount of help given are also 1 in all villages. We have added a
note to Table 2’s caption.
6) Is the probability of helping a household with R = 0.25 and no help reciprocated really nearly 1
(100%) as indicated in the sigmoid figure b?
Response: This probability is 0.635 [0.470, 0.773].
7) The correlation table would be more informative, if it reported the correlation coefficients in the
entries and then marked significance in some other way.
Response: We have reversed the figure – numbers in cells now show correlation coefficients and cell
colour gives a guide to statistical significance. Blue cells are statistically significant (P < 0.05), with
darker shades as P approaches zero; white cells are borderline statistically significant; red and grey cells
are not statistically significant.
8) Why is interaction between child presence and relatedness reported in main text, when it does not
appear in the best fitting model described in the table.
Response: This interaction terms was included in all models that we marked as ‘relatedness’. We have
added a note to Table 4’s caption to highlight this.
9) To organize the disparate findings, it would be helpful to include the findings for support for or
against each of the hypotheses in table 1.
Response: Added to Table 1.
