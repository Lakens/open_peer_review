Authors presented an interesting study on modelling and evaluation of the propagation of
cardiac electric potentials for wearable devices.
The following points need to be addressed:
1. In the experimental validation part, it’s unclear whether there is any variation (in ear-ECG or
face-CG) between two subjects tested, in other words, is two a sufficient number for the
evaluation or validation of the 3D model?
2. Clarify ‘simple data conditioning’ (L31p6). Concha ECG recording (fig 4b) is ‘noisy’, as
expected, how the data was processed in comparison with that in reference ECG?
3. In addition to the comparison with the reference (arm ECG, in table 2), further comment on the
comparison of the experimental results with those of simulated ones from the 3D model. In other
words, is the 3D model highly representative?

This paper presents electromagnetic biophysical modelling of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as
they propagate from the heart to the head so that head mounted ECG recordings can be
performed and optimized to give the same information as conventional ECG. This has
advantages in terms of ease of application/wearability as no electrodes as required on the chest. I
have a number of concerns with the current manuscript.
1) Admittedly I do not use it in daily practice, but I never thought that head ECG was particularly
hard to do. It has been reported previously (see e.g. D. Da He, E. S. Winokur and C. G. Sodini, "A
continuous, wearable, and wireless heart monitor using head ballistocardiogram (BCG) and head
3
electrocardiogram (ECG)," 2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in
Medicine and Biology Society, Boston, MA, 2011, pp. 4729-4732.) and the authors themselves
have already published many papers ([2]-[4], [18]) which demonstrate head ECG measurements.
The authors do not clearly state how the current work relates to all of this background literature.
A more systematic review of the literature, and what these articles present is required.
Certainly to my knowledge a theoretical background/modelling has not been considered before,
but given that it is readily apparent head ECG signals can be recorded the authors need better
justification for why (given inevitable modelling inaccuracies) this is particularly useful
compared to a more empirical approach which intrinsically accounts for subject variabilities. It is
clear that the modelling is useful for optimizing the electrode placements and similar, but I
would see this as a much smaller contribution compared to that currently stated in the article. A
much clearer statement on the specific contributions and the conclusions from these are required.
At present the contributions are limited to advising on electrode locations, but no consideration is
given to whether these correspond to easy locations to integrate into a helmet, or indeed if better
locations are available but not integratable.
2) The methods are incredibly briefly explained. Fig. 2a in particular is very poor. What do the
different colour lines mean? What are the axis labels/scales? Shouldn't it be a 3D dipole? No scale
is included in Fig. 2b. There are no details on the type of simulation performed in Comsol, the
grid size, boundary conditions and many other factors. What is the sensitivity of the modelling
to these parameters and to the different choices for the values in Table 1? The current methods
don't really say anything more than "we did some modelling in Comsol". Similarly no details on
the ECG set up are given. The amplifier details and electrode sizes and materials will be
important for assessing the noise floor present (significant for the smaller amplitude head ECG
signals).
3) Further verification of the modelling is required. I would expect at least a chest ECG signal
from the model to be included to help demonstrate accuracy compared to a well known ECG
trace. I would also suggest that the authors quantity the modelling error (via the root mean error
or similar). This could then be compared to the modelling error from other methods, and would
highlight the substantial error in Fig. 4 channel LM-LJ where the model predicted no visible T
wave. If possible further details on the source of this error are required. At present is it rather
unconvincingly dismissed and does not give me confidence that the modelling has been well
investigated and verified.
4) It is not clear why the reference ECG signal is recorded across the arms rather than standard
locations on the chest. The conclusion states "suitable head-ECG recording position for medical
quality" but I do not see how "medical quality" can be claimed when using an arm rather than
chest reference. The recordings should be changed to correct this. Indeed, to put the timing
differences from Table 2 in context it would be useful to do a full lead chest ECG and to include
how much the waveform timings differ between the leads. Is the variation in head-ECG timings
comparable to these?
5) An explicit measure of signal SNR should be added to Table 2. The authors discuss SNR in the
text, inferring it based upon the times in Table 2, rather than doing an explicit quantification for
some (unclear) reason.
6) No information is included on how to access the models, code and supporting material as
required by this journal.
7) Fig. 1b is very low quality.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewer 1:
We wish to express our gratitude to Reviewer 1 for their detailed comments which have helped us to
clarify the material in the manuscript. Our response is as follows.
1. In the original manuscript, the experimental validation was performed for a single subject, over two
separate recordings. We have completely revised this part and have included the measurements on five
more participants, with the same experimental setup. While the quality of the results is similar to the
initial results, we can now also show that the different characteristic waveforms (P-, Q-, R-, S-, and T-
waves) from the participants are accurately reflected in head-ECG. In addition, ear-ECG was recorded
from five subjects with different waveforms in the cardiac cycles and the results are shown in Figure 6,
Figure 7, and Table 3.
2. We have now added a new section and algorithm-style step-by-step instructions outlining in detail
how the recordings were processed. The new Section (“2. (d) Signal processing”) can be found on pages
4 and 5, and the algorithmic overview is on page 5.
3. In order to enable a validation of the 3D model beyond the comparison of the simulations and
measurements on the head surface, we have now extracted and plotted the modelled cardiac cycles for
known standard ECG-traces. For example, Figure 2 on page 6 shows the results for the standard limb
leads Lead I, II and III. These cycles correspond to the results in the open literature which further
validates the robustness of our model.
Response to Reviewer 2:
We thank Reviewer 2 for their insightful comments and for providing suggestions on how to improve the
clarity. Our response is as follows.
1) It is correct that cardiac signals have been recorded from the head before. However, all studies on
this topic (including those the reviewer mentioned in their comment) only extract the timings of R-waves
from the ECG. This is already – due to high noise levels and low signal amplitudes – not trivial to
achieve. However, while R-wave timings are sufficient for determining the heart rate and its variations
over long periods of time, this knowledge alone does not enable more complex analyses of ECG or
medical diagnoses. We have now emphasized this aspect in the last paragraphs of the Introduction and
have added examples for heart conditions that can be diagnosed with the new head-ECG system. Those
include, among others, myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation. All mentioned heart conditions are
visible in Lead I in multiple consecutive cardiac cycles and we can therefore expect to be able to identify
them in our recorded cardiac cycles from head- and ear-based sensors.
In addition, we would highlight that the system developed by Da He et al. is wearable but not
unobtrusive or discreet, since electrodes need to be attached to the skin around the ear and are clearly
visible.
The motivation for our approach was that it is not uncommon to make misleading conclusions from only
an empirical evidence of a phenomenon. This is why the vast majority of accepted and robust methods
have been eventually supported by biophysics/physiology models. This is particularly important for weak
data for which the existing models are not applicable, and the experimental evidence is only emerging.
In this particular case, the proposed model for the propagation of ECG to the head has been missing in
the open literature. The model also provides an insight into the expected cardiac cycles, and helps
establish the feasibility of ECG measurements on the head. Provided that the simulations and
measurements match, as is the case in our work, this indicates that no artefacts or undesired signals
from other sources were present, and that all waveform details that can be measured from the head in
theory are also reflected in our measurements. In the second step, our head-ECG measurements are
compared to standard Lead I recordings from the arms (Fig. 3), in order to establish that: i) the
proposed measurements and methods are indeed true ECG and ii) the head-ECG signals we observed
are comparable in their information content to a standard ECG lead. This both validates the recording
setup and supports the claim that we can produce a medically relevant ECG from head-worn devices.
This is a breakthrough in unobtrusive and discreet wearable ECG and has direct application in the
monitoring of chronic cardiac diseases (out of the scope of this present work).
Another advantage of the proposed head-ECG biophysics model is that it naturally suggests the best of
the practically relevant electrode positions. In our work, all positions that were used in the experiment
are integratable into a helmet or onto a standard earplug. We have now included a statement pointing
that out in Section “2. (c) Electrode arrangement”. Figure 3a) shows that the potential differences
become stronger towards the base of the neck. However, that part is not covered by the helmet and
cannot be used in our application.
2) We have now added a new section and an algorithm-style protocol which outline all signal processing
steps and enable interested readers to replicate our analysis in a step-by-step fashion (Section “2.(d)
Signal processing” and Algorithm 1). The caption to Figure 2a) (now Figure 1b)) has been expanded and
now explains the meaning of the different colours. In addition, the axes are now labelled in mm for the
dimensions of the heart muscle and in mAm for the magnitude and the orientation of the heart vector,
and Figure 2b) (Figure 3a) in the revised manuscript) now includes a colour palette to illustrate the
values the electric potentials on the body surface (in millivolts).
Furthermore, more details about the simulation are provided in Section “2. (a) Model geometry”. The
grid size depends on the geometrical complexity of a given region. For example, the elements describing
the boundary of the surrounding sphere have a much larger grid than those that define the geometry of
the skull, see Fig. 1.
Similarly, Section “2. (c) Electrode arrangement” now contains more details regarding the experimental
details: Gold-plated electrodes with a 10mm diameter and filled with conductive gel were utilised and
the recording was performed using an Avatar biosignal recorder.
3) Agreed and corrected. We have created an additional figure (Figure 2 in the revised manuscript)
which shows the simulated cardiac cycles for the standard limb leads. They correspond to the standard
Lead I, II and III from the literature and are shown in the new Fig. 3. Thank you for suggesting to
include this analysis. We have also restructured the Results Section. In the first part, we use Figure 2 to
validate the model in general, and subsequently the results of the now validated simulation are used to
compare the predicted and measured cardiac cycles on the head. Afterwards, the quality of the
measurements is assessed based on four metrics (three of them are new in the revised manuscript and
address additional properties of the cardiac cycle) in Table 2 for six subjects in total, instead of just one
subject in the original submission.
The new recordings utilise a bipolar setup which is more robust to external noise. For example, a
mechanical impact on the reference electrode in the previous set-up would influence all channels, while
with the updated set-up, only one channel would be affected. Due to the bipolar set-up across the
sagittal plane, the electrode positions LM-LJ and RM-RJ were replaced by other channels.
We are not aware of any other study which has attempted to model the cardiac potentials on the head
surface and therefore we cannot compare the results of our methods to an existing method.
4) As a reference, we chose the standard limb leads Lead I to Lead III. In a separate recording we
verified that the waveforms from Lead I (left arm – right arm) are practically the same when recording
ECG from the arms or across the chest; the figure is not included in the manuscript, but we can provide
it on request. Since the recording channels on the face lie almost in parallel to one another (see Fig.
2a)) and therefore the projection of the heart vector onto the individual channels would practically be
the same for all channels, we can only expect to measure one component of the total ECG. This
component is highly correlated with Lead I, which also uses a horizontal electrode arrangement. This
justifies the use of Lead I to analyse the similarities between the head- and the limb-ECG.
Regarding the timing differences between different leads, we addressed this issue in two ways. Firstly,
we have included three more metrics to assess the quality of the head-ECG (see Table 2). The newly
added metrics do not consider the timings but the shape and the relative amplitudes of features and
thereby take into account additional features of cardiac cycles. Secondly, (not included in the
manuscript, as we believe it is out of scope of this study) we have examined the timings of cardiac
features in Lead I, Lead II and Lead III for one subject. The maximum time differences for the different
features were: T: 11ms, S: 45ms (this is because the S-wave is not well defined and not accurately
identifiable in Lead I; between Lead II and III the time difference was 1ms), R: 8ms, Q: 22ms (similar
issue as in the S-wave but for Lead II and III), P: 8ms.
5) Since there is no ground truth for the actual signal, i.e. its exact shape and amplitude are unknown, it
is not possible to calculate a traditional SNR. The closest to the SNR that can be achieved is the
comparison between the individual cardiac cycles around every R-wave and the mean cardiac cycle
across all individual cycles. This provides a proxy for the variance in a head-ECG channel under
consideration. The results of this analysis are included in Table 2, column “iv) Noise” on page 8. The
results confirm the discussion in the original submission which was of a qualitative nature. For example,
the noise (i.e. the variation around the mean over multiple cycles) is highest in the Forehead-channel.
6) The materials were uploaded to Dryad and to our own website. For this review, we have only
uploaded them to Dryad and the link is included in the document.
7) Agreed and corrected. Figure 1 b) has been replaced by an annotated screenshot of the body
geometry, which also displays the new electrode positions.
