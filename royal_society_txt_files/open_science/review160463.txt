The causes of parental and sex role differences among animals is an active, progressive research
field. This study is an excellent, well-written test of the causes of great differences between two
closely related species in the same area, polyandrous black coucals (BC) and monogamous white-
browed coucals (WBC). They represent a rare, nearly ideal situation for comparing two closely
related contrasting species breeding as neighbors in the same area. It is therefore a most welcome,
rare kind of study.
Painstakingly measuring parental expenditure (incubation and feeding) and offspring
production, which is far from easy under these field conditions, the authors show convincingly
that in contrast with predictions, monogamous WBC work less, not more than BC in raising
similar numbers of offspring. Differences in food abundance is therefore refuted as a sufficient
present cause of their different parental roles and sex differences.
Instead, the authors suggest a likely evolutionary progression of changes that have led up to the
present differences between the two species. The black coucal has evolved from ancestors that
were apparently monogamous, with females somewhat larger than males. The factors leading to
male-only parental care, great sexual size dimorphism with much larger females, polyandry, and
strong sexual selection in females, are suggested to be 1) migration and high breeding density
owing to abundant food, 2) high nest predation, 3) female emancipation from incubation, 4) with
possibility of acquiring several mates, 5) strong sexual selection and 6) larger female body size,
increasing reproductive success but also mortality, hence 7) male-biased sex-ratio.
These suggestions are plausible in relation to the interesting results that the authors have
presented here and elsewhere. But I think a clearer distinction between primary and secondary
influences, and some words about their likely evolutionary interplay and feedback relations,
could further strengthen the suggested explanation and provide a more explicit framework for
future testing, in these or other species.
Factors 1 – 3 seem likely to be the initial, primary steps on the black coucal’s route towards
presently extreme polyandry and sexual size dimorphism. Point 4 is a crucial intermediate
consequence of 1-3, creating a new selection pressure: 5, sexual selection in females that compete
over territories and mates. The new selection pressure favors (as a secondary consequence of 1 –
4) point 6) larger body size, which in turn leads to 7) strongly male-biased sex ratio. There are
several likely mutual feedback loops among these points.
Sex ratio is sometimes regarded as an independent influence on the strength of sexual selection,
and in some cases it may well be so. But here, it seems likely that strongly male-biased sex ratio is
as much a consequence as a cause of sexual selection. It may be both, because of feedback loops
among several factors in points 4-7, and this seems worth pointing out. I therefore suggest adding
some words about feedback loops. Manipulation of an accessible variable in a likely mutual
feedback system may offer a rare possibility for experimental testing of evolutionary hypotheses,
if not in coucals in some other, more easily accessible system.
The manuscript is well-written, and I have only a few minor suggestions.

Title: I suggest rephrasing the negative title, instead mentioning what the study helps explain, for
instance: The causes of parental and sex role differences: a test in two contrasting coucal species.
L 19, add a sentence saying e.g. “The two species ate the same kinds of prey but in different
proportions.”
L 20, for clarity replace “pairs of” by “both mates combined”.
L 256 – 259, did black coucal males make much shorter foraging trips?
L 326, omit “from black coucals”
L 354, rephrase “Unlike predicted”
Congratulations on an excellent study.

RE-Report RSOS-160085
This study explores differences in parental behaviour and their consequences for offspring
growth in two closely related coucal species that differ in sex roles during the period of parental
care. The biparental species provides food to their nestlings at a low rate, while the male-only
care species has feeding frequencies that are higher than two times the total feeding rate of a
given biparental couple. However, no differences in offspring growth were observed, which
could potentially relate to prey type and size differences between the two species.
The study has been performed over several years, the study system is very interesting, and the
topic also of great relevance. However, many details concerning data collection, sample sizes, and
analyses are missing, and some of the conclusions and hypotheses are a bit too speculative. E.g.
the title suggests that differences in parental expenditure are investigated, but this is not the case.
Instead feeding rates (and to some extend incubation behaviour) are measured, which should be
stated correctly throughout the manuscript. My further queries are listed below, in order of
appearance:
4
Line 19: That is a rather frequent statement, that the habitat is food-rich. Has that somehow be
quantified, and is it as food-rich in frogs as it is in grasshoppers? That becomes relevant for your
argumentation that follows , as you argue that food is not a driving force for the evolution of uni-
parental care. And if there is so much food, why is the bi-parental species not laying more eggs?
The conclusions (line 21-28) seem not to be derived from the data, e.g. Line 24: How do you
know? That was not tested. A mate removal or brood size manipulation would be a next logical
step in order to address this question. Line 26: Neither of the parameters that is mentioned here
was measured (magnitude of sexual selection, adult sex ratio bias, environmental conditions).
And it is not only interesting to know why a pattern is not there, but also why does it not evolve.
Line 62: male-only
Line 72-73: What about sexual conflict? Uni-parental care may remove the costs of negotiation.
Line 92: Maybe selecting for the production of high quality offspring that are able to withstand
the harsh conditions to come.
Line 116: Were in 2005-10 only white-browed coucals studied? As black coucals breed “... around
June…”. Please provide the information concerning the sample sizes of both species across the
different years of your study.
Line 102: Egg mass differences?
Line 121: What is the index used for?
Line 122: Please provide the numbers of tagged birds per species.
Line 125-130: How regular were the checks, and how sound are incubation checks that are
performed every 4th day?
Line 131: Could you provide some example (as supplementary material)? And please include
more details, as 3 days is quite different from 6 days.
Line 142: How often did you check to find a nestling in order to have the age accurate?
Line 146: Why are data and analyses not included in the manuscript?
Line 149: How many hours per nest? Is it once 60min? Based on what is provided below it is
apparently about 4h?
Line 160: What about (standardized) laying date and year? Why is that not taken into account
here and in the subsequent incubation behaviour analysis?
Line 163: How does the data structure look like, several measures per individual or one value per
individual? And what is the added value for “the total absence duration” and “mean absence
duration” respectively?
Line 175: Why is clutch mass (or rather brood mass) included? Nestling age and brood size may
be better options. It looks like a circular argument to include brood mass. Again laying date and
year could be included as well? Although laying date is probably reflecting species differences
too?
Line 232-234, 241-244, 256-261: rather part of the discussion?
Line 247: This interaction hinges on one female? In case of incubation you argue that you can’t
include black coucal females as they don’t incubate. And how does that fit with having two data
points in Fig. 2 BC female? These are estimates of mean feeding rates?
Line 262: Why is prey size not quantified?
Line 277-8: How do I see that?
Line 279-286: How should that be interpreted?
Line 304-5: Do black coucals maybe fledge prematurely to avoid predation, which is more
pronounced in this species? And in terms of % adult body mass it looks as if there would be
differences between the two species, and how should that be interpreted, if so?
Line 322-4: Repeating my earlier question, is food as abundant for both species? Why do black
coucals not forage for frogs, if so abundant and more valuable? And why do white-browed
coucals not raise more nestlings?
Line 344: Be careful in your interpretation as you pointed out yourself in the results section.
Line 350: Frees them from the costs of incubation?
Line 357-8: This is very speculative, that has not been tested explicitly.
5
Line 363: Speculative, there may be e.g. a low site fidelity? And do you see the same black coucal
females across years?
Line 367-372: Remove? This section stands rather loose.
Line 373-389: This section is not related to the results of this study neither.

According to the Abstract, this paper sets out to test whether the degree of parental cooperation is
due to the strength of sexual selection, and an adult sex ratio bias, or due to environmental
harshness.
There is a lot to admire about this paper. Relatively little is known about the biology of coucals,
so the data reported here are a valuable contribution to the literature and each data point
collected must have involved a huge effort in the field. The data are analysed carefully and the
Bayesian approach is thoughtful and well-justified.
For me, the key weakness of the paper lies in the way in which it seeks to connect these valuable
observational data to concepts in the theoretical literature.
First the paper measures neither the adult sex ratio bias nor environmental harshness directly –
yet these are the two key explanatory factors in the conclusions drawn at the end (see for
example, line 395).
Instead we have data on provisioning rates, incubation patterns, sex roles in parental care and
nestling growth rates that are compared between two different species. This is because (lines 69-
71) ‘the aim was to evaluate whether differences in the apparent requirement for parental care or
in the growth pattern of young could potentially drive the difference sex roles and mating system
between the two species’.
6
The problem here is that observations alone cannot tell us the requirement for parental care – the
observation is an outcome, not a causal factor. An experimental manipulation is required to
determine cause and effect. Furthermore, the authors equate observed provisioning rates with
parental expenditure. This is problematic for a number of reasons. It assumes that the prey
delivered at the nest are of equal value each time – yet clearly they are not. It also assumes that
parents pay the same cost for each nest visit. This we cannot know. Thus the comparison of nest
visit rates between species cannot tell us very much at all about the causal factors underlying the
difference in sex roles between the species: the measurements are not directly comparable and
anyway causality cannot be inferred without an experiment.

The work compares parental behaviour between 2 closely related coucal species: one has
conventional sex role whereas the other has sex role reversal. As the authors correctly argue, the
fact that these 2 species live in the same environment provides great opportunities to understand
what might drive their difference in sex roles.
The paper is well written, convincing and interesting. I only have the following comments.
1. The paper seems to focus on parental expenditure, although this focus in my opinion is not
justified. Just by reading the Abstract I thought that they measured energy expenditure and
metabolic rates.
Expenditure is not the best term, since even if a parent delivers few items to the chicks, if he/she
has to fly further away, then his/her energy expenditure might well be higher than those parents
who deliver many items by collecting from around the nest. Perhaps just say "parental
behaviour", or "incubation", "brood feeding,...
7
I see that the logic is using life-history trade-off: if there is solid experimental evidence FROM
COUCALS that high workload indeed precipitate into higher parental mortality, then using
expenditure might be OK.
2. The higher rate of nest predation in black coucals is consistent with the author's argument that
absences create opportunities for predators. Are these predators snakes, mongooses or other
birds such as crows?
3. I was missing sample sizes in most analyses. For F tests, r2 I strongly suggest including DF or
N. The meaning of specific observations, eg lines 247 - 249 also depend on whether the number
of nests that were observed was 191 or just 2. I presume, for most analyses N will be
substantially less than 191 - this is perfectly fine, as long as the reader can assess how large
sample sizes were used to infer certain patterns.
Table 1 should also say the number of nests (not only the number of items delivered)
3. I wonder whether growth rate could be better analysed. I presume, there are enough data to fit
growth curve to each individual chick, and then these growth parameters could be used as
response variables in a mixed-model setting, eg test whether species, sex of the chick, hatch date,
brood size etc might influence the growth of each individual chick.
An overall model analysing growth could provide lot more information than single-species (or
cross-species) analyses themselves, and they have the advantage of allowing to control for hatch
date.
A similar approach could be adopted for feeding rates.
4. In Figs do not abbreviate species names nor use acronyms: they put off readers. Spell out
species names - there is enough space on all graphs.
5. One section I found too wordy was growth rates (lines 270-290). These sentences are quite long
and cumbersome. This section could be speeded up since the main patterns can be summarised in
a succinct para.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
The authors have made an effort to clarify a number of aspects concerning methods and sample
sizes as well as to adjust terminology when necessary. Both of which were shortcomings of the
previous manuscript that have been addressed now. However, I still have a number of queries
that still should be dealt with:
The terminology has been changed, however, “parental cooperation” may not be the best choice
neither. See e.g. line 14 “to better understand sex differences in cooperation”, what is the sex
difference referring to? Why not using “parental care”? Somewhat below the term “sex roles in
parental care” is used, which would be a good option for the title too.
Please rephrase line 23-24 “We conclude that a food-rich habitat with a benign climate may be a
necessary, but is not a sufficient factor for the evolution of uniparental care”. If just the climate
would be relevant more if not all species in that habitat should show uni-parentaI care, which is
obviously not the case. However, the low levels of care in the bi-parental species suggest that
there is potential to provide more care, which they by whatever reason do not provide. That
could be stated more clearly.
Line 182: Please rephrase the term `nuisance variables´. And why are you treating your covariates
differently? E.g. even if time of the day is not contributing to the model, it is retained, while year
is systematically dropped.
Line 279-282: Remove? This is quite repetitive, and in case of the parental perspective, it also
reverses the argumentation as absence bouts but not expenditure is studied.
Line 197: Please mention the number and range of feeding visits per nest, as this is more relevant
for the statistics than the time it took to record.
14
Line 203: I still disagree with including brood mass instead of nestling age and brood size. Broods
may be heavy for a given age because of the quality of the parents. Thus including brood mass
then again to explain parental feeding, which involves quality differences among parents, is not a
good choice I think. Second, brood mass is also more likely confounded by species differences.
This should be corrected.
Line 295-297: This is confusing, please omit. It is furthermore repeated below. It is sufficient from
my point of view to state that you did not measure foraging trips in time or length. Given that
you didn’t you can’t state anything else about it.
Line 313: I could not find a description of the statistical procedures concerning the off-times? And
the female black coucals that were part of this analysis, are these the partners of the male coucals
that are part of this study?
Line 333-334: “both female and male white-browed coucals reached a higher asymptotic body
mass than female and male black coucals” Doesn’t that suggest that male black coucals are,
despite the higher effort they make, and despite the unlimited food resources, not able to raise as
high quality offspring as white-browed coucals? That should be discussed more substantially. In
the abstract it is just stated that “these differences in parental care were not reflected in offspring
growth”, which is rather vague. In line 364 onwards it is then argued that the species do not
differ in important growth parameters, which I find confusing. That is mainly based on k, but
asymptotic mass is not mentioned. It is only stated that white browed coucals fledge later, which
is something different. Including the analysis of tarsus length in the manuscript may in fact be
very helpful to understand species differences in growth trajectories and resource allocation to
different traits!

Review Goymann et al Sex roles, parental cooperation and offspring growth in two
contrasting coucal species
The manuscript presents exciting and substantial research in a clear manner using sound analysis
and logic. It is stimulating and an important and in many ways unrivalled contribution to the
field. I have few comments. Maybe my main contribution is to ask for a broader approach to the
interpretation and discussion of the findings rather than an alignment with Remeš et al which
sometimes seems a bit forced.
I congratulate the authors to their work.
Line 22-24: The argument made here is somewhat inconsistent. If a difference in food types is
claimed between the two species it is not obvious why the habitat should be food rich for both
species or in fact even one of them. Time spent trapping and handling prey may still mean the
species is food limited. I do not suggest or believe they are I just think this needs to be phrase
carefully.
Regardless, the conclusion drawn from this that these conditions are conducive to uniparental
care but do not inevitably lead to it is not surprising given the scarcity of uniparental care in birds
and the fact that these would not be the only 2 bird species living in a food rich environment.
It also directly contradicts Line 88
Line 24 what and whose previous results
Line 68-73 This is very dense the contrasting hypotheses could be spelt out more clearly.
Line 78 and elsewhere. I would think that genus would be a more suitable term than taxon
Line 170 Whose personal observation?
Line 271 re phrase “rule out” rather than “exclude”
Line 272 A sentence on night incubation in Black coucals may be warranted
Line 275 re-phrase: Also the total duration nest remained unattended was longer...
Line 278-279: Not sure what this statement or figure add to the argument
Line 288: It is not clear what cases means here is it nests then state that and also the number of
nests rather than the number of feeds
Line 295: This sentence is confusing. I believe you are saying that WBC territories were not
significantly bigger and cannot to justify a lower feeding rate and neither can direct observation
of the length of foraging trips of each species. Line 301 expresses this better but you say this twice
Line 297: Hence is not the right way to start this sentence because the conclusion you draw it does
not follow from the previous sentence but from the one before that.
Line 295 ff and Line 301 ff. seem more suited to the discussion
Line 424 ff Maybe say: Hence a good food supply may be a necessary factor for the evolution of
biparental care but perhaps unsurprisingly does not inevitably lead to the evolution even in
closely related and ecologically similar species.
I do indeed wonder why given your finding female White-browed coucals do not at least try to
raise a brood of their own even if they were not going for polyandry. Female shorebirds happily
do this of course. This may be worth bringing up in discussion, I guess asking not only why BC
have uniparental care but also asking why white-browed coucals do not.
line 427 ff. This is a bit of a chicken and egg thing here is the sex ratio skewed because there is
uniparental care or is there uniparental care because the sex ratio is skewed. Unless there is a
credible independent reason for a male biased DULT sex ratio in BC this argument seems week.
Line 445 may have been NOT may have be
Line 460-462 Unclear. I am assuming this is trying to say exactly the same thing as the next
sentence.
Line 464. The potential to find additional mates would stop the evolution of polyandry but not
that for uniparental care.
16
Line 482 I am not sure I accept this conclusion that the observed differences in sex roles and care
are due to the strength of sexual selection when in fact differences in predation rate and the
environmental harshness of the plains during the dry season are invoked to explain the
differences in breeding density in the first place.
I do wonder whether the two different coucal strategies are not rather just two ways to deal with
predation risk. Black coucals use an r strategy vs WBC using a K strategy, trying to minimize nest
visits maximize vigilance etc.
A detailed study of predation patterns maybe using remote cameras may be clarifying this as
well as subsequent experimental variation to the nest predation risk.

It is obviously a difficult task to fulfill the requests of different referees, I can imagine. However, I
have with the current version of the manuscript the impression that a number of insertion are
rather repetitive or distracting, given also that the initial submission was well-written. So - as a
final task - carefully evaluating and removing overlap between sections would strongly benefit
the manuscript, as well as trying to make better links with newly inserted parts. I give some
examples of sections that could be improved below.
Some additional suggestions:
Line 46 and 50: Please delete “also”.
22
Line 74-82: This new paragraph does not link well with the previous paragraph. Maybe, delete
line 74-75, starting then with: “We hypothesize that a larger required effort…”. And it may be
redundant as most of its content will be repeated e.g. line 126 onwards.
Line 206-207: It is, still, unclear for me why hatch date or year are not biologically meaningful,
there is ample evidence for both. So this statement should be deleted.
Line 372: typo: thy
Line 370-74; very similar to line 412-415
Line 497 onwards: this section is rather similar to the section on positive feedback loops in the
introduction. Maybe an option to shorten it here or in the introduction.
Supplement: Data on tarsus could be integrated in table 2, and adding the statistical outcome to
the main manuscript does not add more than 1-2 sentences. I also suggest to decide for one
feeding rate analysis rather than leaving the choice to the reader, that is a bit odd. I have
previously argued that brood mass may be more confounded by species differences. If keeping
brood mass you should thus test the species * brood mass interaction. In any case all data could
be integrated in the main file, which I think should be aimed at.

causes of parental and sex role differences among animals is an active,
gressive research field. This study is an excellent, well-written test of
causes of great differences between two closely related species in the
e area, polyandrous black coucals (BC) and monogamous white-browed coucals
C). They represent a rare, nearly ideal situation for comparing two closely
ated contrasting species breeding as neighbors in the same area. It is
refore a most welcome, rare kind of study.
nstakingly measuring parental expenditure (incubation and feeding) and
spring production, which is far from easy under these field conditions, the
hors show convincingly that in contrast with predictions, monogamous WBC
k less, not more than BC in raising similar numbers of offspring.
ferences in food abundance is therefore refuted as a sufficient present
se of their different parental roles and sex differences.
tead, the authors suggest a likely evolutionary progression of changes that
e led up to the present differences between the two species. The black
cal has evolved from ancestors that were apparently monogamous, with
ales somewhat larger than males. The factors leading to male-only parental
e, great sexual size dimorphism with much larger females, polyandry, and
ong sexual selection in females, are suggested to be 1) migration and high
eding density owing to abundant food, 2) high nest predation, 3) female
ncipation from incubation, 4) with possibility of acquiring several mates,
strong sexual selection and 6) larger female body size, increasing
roductive success but also mortality, hence 7) male-biased sex-ratio.
se suggestions are plausible in relation to the interesting results that
authors have presented here and elsewhere. But I think a clearer
tinction between primary and secondary influences, and some words about
ir likely evolutionary interplay and feedback relations, could further
engthen the suggested explanation and provide a more explicit framework for
ure testing, in these or other species.
tors 1 – 3 seem likely to be the initial, primary steps on the black
cal’s route towards presently extreme polyandry and sexual size dimorphism.
nt 4 is a crucial intermediate consequence of 1-3, creating a new selection
ssure: 5, sexual selection in females that compete over territories and
es. The new selection pressure favors (as a secondary consequence of 1 – 4)
nt 6) larger body size, which in turn leads to 7) strongly male-biased sex
io. There are several likely mutual feedback loops among these points.
ratio is sometimes regarded as an independent influence on the strength of
ual selection, and in some cases it may well be so. But here, it seems
ely that strongly male-biased sex ratio is as much a consequence as a cause
sexual selection. It may be both, because of feedback loops among several
tors in points 4-7, and this seems worth pointing out. I therefore suggest
ing some words about feedback loops. Manipulation of an accessible variable
a likely mutual feedback system may offer a rare possibility for
erimental testing of evolutionary hypotheses, if not in coucals in some
er, more easily accessible system.

s study explores differences in parental behaviour and their consequences
offspring growth in two closely related coucal species that differ in sex
es during the period of parental care. The biparental species provides food
their nestlings at a low rate, while the male-only care species has feeding
quencies that are higher than two times the total feeding rate of a given
arental couple. However, no differences in offspring growth were observed,
ch could potentially relate to prey type and size differences between the
species.
study has been performed over several years, the study system is very
eresting, and the topic also of great relevance. However, many details
cerning data collection, sample sizes, and analyses are missing, and some
the conclusions and hypotheses are a bit too speculative. E.g. the title
gests that differences in parental expenditure are investigated, but this
not the case. Instead feeding rates (and to some extend incubation
aviour) are measured, which should be stated correctly throughout the
uscript.
adhered to a probably rather loose definition of parental expenditure
luding time or energy invested into parental care interpreting feeding
es and incubation patterns as “time invested into parental care”. Part of
reason was that in a previous version of the manuscript we had included
ess-hormone data in relation to parental care, but these data distracted
m the focus of the current manuscript and were removed. Unfortunately, we

ck (1991) and Royle, Smiseth and Kölliker (2014) we agree with the referee

further queries are listed below, in order of appearance:

that somehow be quantified, and is it as food-rich in frogs as it is in
sshoppers? That becomes relevant for your argumentation that follows , as
argue that food is not a driving force for the evolution of uni-parental
e. And if there is so much food, why is the bi-parental species not laying
e eggs?
Usangu is a tropical seasonal wetland and has been classified as one of 80
ortant Bird areas of Tanzania. During the rainy season millions of birds
ed in the seasonal wetlands and it probably harvests 450 different species
birds (Baker and Baker 2002, Important Bird Areas of Tanzania: A first
entory. Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam). During
rainy season birds arrive in the Usangu to “exploit the massive food
ential released by the initial flooding of the grasslands” (Baker and
er, 2002). Even though there are no data for the Usangu, the net primary
ductivity is higher in tropical wetlands than in any other ecosystem type
ue, H. U., et al. (1997) Carbon in tropical wetlands. Geoderma 79, 163-
.). We have not quantified food abundance, because an adequate quantitative
wer of that question would have taken so much of our time that we could not
e studied coucals, which was our aim. But considering that it is well-known
t seasonal wetlands belong to the most productive habitats on earth and
ed on personal observations that support this notion (e.g. impressive `frog
certs´ even during the day, the escape behavior of hundreds of grasshoppers
frogs while walking through the area when tracking birds or examining
ts, or frequent visits of up to a dozen or more frogs that are attracted by
sounds of swarming mosquitos while we were waiting under a hide when
ching coucals) we consider it adequate to state that food is superabundant
ing the rainy season. We added some references to support our statement.

e 26: Neither of the parameters that is mentioned here was measured
gnitude of sexual selection, adult sex ratio bias, environmental

stated above, some of these factors relate to a different study where we
pared the bias in the adult sex ratio. And the factor environmental
ditions was addressed, because we studied the two coucal species in the
e environment. We have rephrased the conclusion section.

thank the referee for this comment because it highlights a
understanding. We intended to say that black coucals leave the area in
e, after finishing breeding. But we now see that the sentence could have
n misunderstood in that they would breed in June and then leave. In fact
ck coucals typically start breeding around mid-February. This has been
rified in the revision. In all years, both species have been studied
ultaneously.
e 102: Egg mass differences?
mass differences have been reported in Goymann et al. 2015, but we do not
why this should be of relevance here.
e 121: What is the index used for?
nk you for pointing this out. Initially we had intended to include body
dition and hormone data in this manuscript, where the index was used for a
parison of these factors. However, the manuscript was too long and we thus
it it into two. We removed the index information because it is not relevant

e 122: Please provide the numbers of tagged birds per species.
se numbers are now given in the revision
e 125-130: How regular were the checks, and how sound are incubation checks
t are performed every 4th day?
stated in the manuscript, in the egg-stage, nests were checked every 4 days
the ID of the bird leaving the nest was noted. More frequent checks were
performed to not disturb the nesting area and nesting birds too often. The
cks of radio-tagged birds were more frequent, i.e. 1-2 times a day. The
ubation checks comprise a sample of 154 observations from 28 nests is
ficient to detect a bias in incubation patterns of white-browed coucals.
e 131: Could you provide some example (as supplementary material)? And

nk you for pointing this out. We can see that it is difficult to imagine

cedure of determining absence bouts.
find daily incubation patterns it does not really make a difference whether
eriod of 3 or 6 days are recorded. Nests that were recorded for 6 days
tributed more data points than nests with 3 day recordings, but this is
ounted for by the mixed model analysis with nestID as random factor.
e 142: How often did you check to find a nestling in order to have the age
urate?
stated, nests were checked during the incubation stage every 4 days. Once
expected day of hatching came close we checked the nests more frequently.
h our experience we can very well estimate the age of chicks that are 1-2
s old, it is harder to distinguish 3-4 day old chicks, but we only included
t data of nestlings for which we knew the exact age. Nests that were found
a later developmental stage or where we could not precisely age the young
not contribute to the analysis.
e 146: Why are data and analyses not included in the manuscript?
ause the results of the tarsus analysis are similar to the body mass
ults that are reported in the manuscript, we decided to include the tarsus
ults only as a supplement. We have clarified this in the revision of the
uscript.
e 149: How many hours per nest? Is it once 60min? Based on what is provided
ow it is apparently about 4h?
al observation times differed from nest to nest, but were at least 2 times
min per nest. We included information regarding this in the revision of the
uscript.
e 160: What about (standardized) laying date and year? Why is that not
en into account here and in the subsequent incubation behaviour analysis?
did not do this analysis, because from our experience we did not expect
t laying date and year would have an impact. But to be sure we repeated the
lysis including Julian date as a covariate and year as a random factor,
e of which explained any of the patterns. Hence we decided to stick to the
ginal analysis, but mention in the manuscript the lack of influence of year
Julian date.
e 163: How does the data structure look like, several measures per
ividual or one value per individual? And what is the added value for “the
al absence duration” and “mean absence duration” respectively?
, each nest (with the temperature loggers we cannot differentiate between
ividuals if more than one individual incubate the nest) contributed several
a points (one per day, and since we recorded nests for 3 or 6 days each
ts contributed either 3 or 6 data points). We have modified the description
make that clear.
n absence duration indicates the average time a nest is unattended per
ence bout. Total absence duration indicates the total time per day the nest
unattended per day. The added value for the mean absence duration is that
clearly shows a diurnal pattern, and the added value for the total time the
t was unattended per day shows the total time the nest is at an increased
k from predation (with regard to predators that the parent could deal
h).
e 175: Why is clutch mass (or rather brood mass) included? Nestling age and
od size may be better options. It looks like a circular argument to include
od mass. Again laying date and year could be included as well? Although
ing date is probably reflecting species differences too?
our view brood mass (clutch mass was changed to brood mass throughout the
ision) gives the best combined estimate of nestling age and brood size,
ause smaller broods and those consisting of younger chicks will have a
er brood mass than broods consisting of larger broods with older young.
s, it allows us to combine measures of nestling age and brood size.
ther, it is difficult to include nestling age, because coucals hatch
nchronously and one would thus need to include mean age or find a different
posite measure. Further, clutch size and mean nestling age would require
covariates in the analysis, whereas brood mass requires only the inclusion
one covariate.
cannot follow the argument that the usage of brood mass would be circular.
course one would expect that a brood with a larger composite mass would
uire more feedings than a brood with a smaller composite mass, but the same
ld be true for a brood with more nestlings or for a brood with older
tlings compared to a brood with fewer or younger nestlings. We considered
od mass the best composite measure to control for nestling age and brood
e when looking at parental feeding rates in species that are characterized
intraspecific differences in the number of nestlings and by variation in
age of nestlings within a clutch. We added a sentence in the methods
tion to explain our decision.
did not include laying dates (which are indeed overlapping between species)
year, because from our experience we did not expect differences. However,
the purpose of responding to the referee, we included year as a random
ect, but it did not change any of the results, so that we decided to drop
from the final analysis. This is now indicated in the manuscript.
e 232-234, 241-244, 256-261: rather part of the discussion?
found these brief statements useful as summaries within the results section
would like to keep them there.
e 247: This interaction hinges on one female? In case of incubation you
ue that you can’t include black coucal females as they don’t incubate. And
does that fit with having two data points in Fig. 2 BC female? These are
imates of mean feeding rates?
this interaction does not hinge on one female and you can see that
icated in the Fig. 2. The two models for incubation and feeding rates
not be directly compared. For the incubation pattern we used a binomial
ed model with nest as the dependent variable that had either the male or
female incubating. Because we did not have a single case of female black
cals incubating doing such a comparison seemed redundant.
feeding rate data have a completely different structure. Here, the
ependent variable is not the nest, but the individual which has a certain
ding rate during each focal nest observation. And this feeding rate can
o can be 0 and regularly is 0 for female black coucals. Hence, for all
ts of black coucals and all nests of white-browed coucals we had feeding
es for all males and for all females. For all of the 256 observations of 76
ts of black coucals that went into the analysis the respective feeding rate
the respective female was 0 except for 2 observations of one nest in which
emale fed her offspring. Thus, the interaction does not hinge on one
ale, but is balanced for males and females of both species. We have
ified the methods section and the results section to clarify the data
ucture.
e 262: Why is prey size not quantified?
ing some observations we quantified prey size (measured on a relative
ale” as prey size times bill size’), but in general there was not much
iance in prey size and the reliability of such classifications is very low,
our view.
e 277-8: How do I see that?
mean that black coucals left the nest earlier or that white-browed coucals
t the nest at a higher body mass? The body mass differences can be simply
n by comparing the asymptotes of the graph, for the age we added some
lanation in the figure caption.
e 279-286: How should that be interpreted?
ically, the data show that the random factors nest and nestling ID showed
siderable variation that should be looked into, but this kind of analysis
ld have a different focus and needs to be published separately (see also
ments of referee 4 and our response to those comments). We added some
lanatory sentences.
e 304-5: Do black coucals maybe fledge prematurely to avoid predation,
ch is more pronounced in this species? And in terms of % adult body mass it
ks as if there would be differences between the two species, and how should
t be interpreted, if so?
coucals leave the nest `prematurely´, that is, before they are able to
. Coucals can only walk when they leave the nest and we thus avoided the
m `fledge´ throughout the manuscript. In terms of % of adult body mass
re is no difference between the species, but there is a difference between
e and female black coucals. Males leave the nest at a similar body mass
ative to adult body mass as white-browed coucals. Only female black coucals
ve the nest at a relatively lower body mass compared to adult body mass.
s has been extensively discussed in Goymann et al. 2015 and in the revision
refer to this discussion.
e 322-4: Repeating my earlier question, is food as abundant for both
cies? Why do black coucals not forage for frogs, if so abundant and more
uable? And why do white-browed coucals not raise more nestlings?
outlined above, the Usangu plains are a typical tropical wetland ecosystem
h lush conditions during the rainy season. Because both species are in the
e habitat at the same time, and because they often have overlapping
ritories we do not see why food abundance should differ for the species.
ck coucals do forage for frogs, but to a lesser extent than white-browed
cals, as our analysis has shown. We do not know why white-browed coucals do
raise more nestlings, but the number of nestlings may be limited by the
acity to incubate eggs (belly surface), the size of the nest (larger nests
be easily visible for predators) or other factors that we do not know. In
revision we include an analysis of off-times, i.e. the time the two coucal
cies do nothing in-between feeding visits, also here are clear differences
ween the two species.

ments to the Author(s)
ording to the Abstract, this paper sets out to test whether the degree of
ental cooperation is due to the strength of sexual selection, and an adult
ratio bias, or due to environmental harshness.
re is a lot to admire about this paper. Relatively little is known about
biology of coucals, so the data reported here are a valuable contribution
the literature and each data point collected must have involved a huge
ort in the field. The data are analysed carefully and the Bayesian
roach is thoughtful and well-justified.
me, the key weakness of the paper lies in the way in which it seeks to
nect these valuable observational data to concepts in the theoretical
erature.
st the paper measures neither the adult sex ratio bias nor environmental
shness directly – yet these are the two key explanatory factors in the
clusions drawn at the end (see for example, line 395).
bias in the adult sex ratio has been reported in a different paper that is
ed in the manuscript (Goymann et al. 2015) and that seasonal tropical
lands belong to the most productive of ecosystems in the world has been
died by others before. We think it is fair to form conclusions based on the
ults of the current study in combination with those of a previous paper
m our group and based on knowledge about ecosystem types. However, in the
ision we have made adjustments in the text to differentiate between the
dings of this study and the findings of previous studies that we rely on.
stated in our reply to referee 2, the Usangu is a tropical seasonal wetland
has been classified as one of 80 Important Bird areas of Tanzania. During
rainy season millions of birds breed in this seasonal wetland (Baker and
er 2002, Important Bird Areas of Tanzania: A first inventory. Wildlife
servation Society of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam). During the rainy season
ds arrive in the Usangu to “exploit the massive food potential released by
initial flooding of the grasslands” (Baker and Baker, 2002). Even though
re are no data for the Usangu, the net primary productivity is higher in
pical wetlands than in any other ecosystem type (Neue, H. U., et al. (1997)
bon in tropical wetlands. Geoderma 79, 163-185.). We have not quantified
d abundance, because an adequate quantitative answer of that question would
e taken so much of our time that we could not have studied coucals, which
our aim. But considering that it is well-known that seasonal wetlands
ong to the most productive habitats on earth and based on personal
ervations that support this notion (e.g. impressive `frog concerts´ even
ing the day, the escape behavior of hundreds of grasshoppers and frogs
le walking through the area when tracking birds or examining nests, or
quent visits of up to a dozen or more frogs that are attracted by the
nds of swarming mosquitos while we were waiting under a hide when catching
cals) we consider it adequate to state that food is superabundant during
rainy season.
tead we have data on provisioning rates, incubation patterns, sex roles in
ental care and nestling growth rates that are compared between two
ferent species. This is because (lines 69-71) ‘the aim was to evaluate
ther differences in the apparent requirement for parental care or in the
wth pattern of young could potentially drive the difference sex roles and
ing system between the two species’.
problem here is that observations alone cannot tell us the requirement for
ental care – the observation is an outcome, not a causal factor. An
erimental manipulation is required to determine cause and effect.
st, we would like to stress that we disagree with the referee that
eriments are the only way to infer causation in evolutionary studies. Ever
ce Darwin there have been two ways to infer causation in evolutionary
dies: One way is to do experiments, the other possibility is a comparative
roach (highlighted in any textbook on evolution). An experiment could be
next step in our study, but the observations of two closely related
cies that have a similar ecology and live in the same habitat, but differ
some core parameters fulfills the requirement of a comparative study. This
especially true since the black coucal is the odd-one out of all coucal
cies, whereas the white-browed coucal represents the more typical coucal
tern.
ond, we do not think that we inferred causation, instead we suggested the
sibility of causation which in our view is sound based on the data we
sent. As the referee correctly cites our aim was “to evaluate whether
ferences in the apparent requirement for parental care or in the growth
terns of young could potentially drive the differences in sex roles…”.
ce, we did not infer causation, we used comparative observations to
estigate if it would be possible that parental care requirements could
luence sex roles. An experiment could be the next step, but any experiment
hout previous observation and knowledge about the behavior of a study
anism seems not very intelligible to us.
rd, on a more general note we find it very unfortunate that the role of
avioral observations of natural populations is undervalued by many
entists. In our view, observations are the necessary basis before any
eriment should be conducted. As stated above, the results reported in this
uscript are the basis for any experimental manipulation. Without these data
foundational knowledge for an experiment would be missing and any
eriment would be conducted out into the blue.
thermore, the authors equate observed provisioning rates with parental
enditure. This is problematic for a number of reasons. It assumes that the
y delivered at the nest are of equal value each time – yet clearly they are
. It also assumes that parents pay the same cost for each nest visit. This
cannot know. Thus the comparison of nest visit rates between species cannot
l us very much at all about the causal factors underlying the difference in
roles between the species: the measurements are not directly comparable
anyway causality cannot be inferred without an experiment.
stated in the comments to referee 2 we adhered to a probably rather loose
inition of parental expenditure including time or energy invested into
ental care, interpreting feeding rates and incubation patterns as “time
ested into parental care”. However, looking up the definitions in Clutton-
ck (1991) and Royle, Smiseth and Kölliker (2014) we agree with the referee
have deleted the term “parental expenditure”. We thank the referees for
nting this out.
stated in the previous section, with regard to the comparative approach we
agree with the referee. Much of evolutionary biology is comparative rather
n experimental and the comparative approach has been a valid and very
ful approach in the history of evolutionary biology. To test whether sex
es in coucals can be altered with an experiment would be a major logistic
eavor and it is difficult to get the necessary funding for it (I have tried
d). After all, coucals are not microbes or drosophila that you can easily
se and manipulate on a petri dish/laboratory.

work compares parental behaviour between 2 closely related coucal species:
has conventional sex role whereas the other has sex role reversal. As the
hors correctly argue, the fact that these 2 species live in the same
ironment provides great opportunities to understand what might drive their
ference in sex roles.
paper is well written, convincing and interesting. I only have the
lowing comments.
The paper seems to focus on parental expenditure, although this focus in my
nion is not justified. Just by reading the Abstract I thought that they
sured energy expenditure and metabolic rates.
enditure is not the best term, since even if a parent delivers few items to
chicks, if he/she has to fly further away, then his/her energy expenditure
ht well be higher than those parents who deliver many items by collecting
m around the nest. Perhaps just say "parental behaviour", or
cubation", "brood feeding,...
stated in the comments to referees 2 and 3 we adhered to a probably rather
se definition of parental expenditure including time or energy invested
o parental care interpreting feeding rates and incubation patterns as “time
ested into parental care”. However, looking up the definitions in Clutton-
ck (1991) and Royle, Smiseth and Kölliker (2014) we agree with the referee
have deleted the term “parental expenditure”. We thank the referees for
nting out this mistake.
ee that the logic is using life-history trade-off: if there is solid
erimental evidence FROM COUCALS that high workload indeed precipitate into
her parental mortality, then using expenditure might be OK.
do not have direct evidence for this, the only evidence we have is that
eline and stress-induced corticosterone concentrations of parental male
ck coucals are much higher than those of white-browed coucals, but this is
ject of a follow-up manuscript.
The higher rate of nest predation in black coucals is consistent with the
hor's argument that absences create opportunities for predators. Are these
dators snakes, mongooses or other birds such as crows?
main predators are snakes, mongoose, feral and wild cats, monitor lizards,
other birds, mainly birds of prey and coppery-tailed coucals, but also
ents.
I was missing sample sizes in most analyses. For F tests, r2 I strongly
gest including DF or N. The meaning of specific observations, eg lines 247
49 also depend on whether the number of nests that were observed was 191 or
t 2. I presume, for most analyses N will be substantially less than 191 -
s is perfectly fine, as long as the reader can assess how large sample
es were used to infer certain patterns.
ple sizes were given repeatedly a) in the methods section and b) in
ition in the figure captions. The referee must have overlooked this
ormation. In mixed model analyses it is difficult to give DF, as it is
ated how many degrees of freedom should be allocated (see discussion by
ker et al. (2009) TREE 24, 127-135). For example, the details for the
lyses described in lines 247-249, that the referee was missing, were given
the methods section (lines 169-170) “The feeding rate analysis was based on 256
vidual observations of 76 black coucal nests (302 hours), and 184 feeding observations of 54 white-
wed coucal nests (209 hours)” and in the figure legend of the previous Fig. 2.
le 1 should also say the number of nests (not only the number of items
ivered)
luded in the revision, but again this referred to the information given in
methods section cited above.
I wonder whether growth rate could be better analysed. I presume, there are
ugh data to fit growth curve to each individual chick, and then these
wth parameters could be used as response variables in a mixed-model
ting, eg test whether species, sex of the chick, hatch date, brood size etc
ht influence the growth of each individual chick.
s might be an interesting approach and we had thought about doing so.
ever, it is difficult to fit individual growth curves to each chick in a
ndardized manner, so that the curves are comparable to each other. The only
iable way of doing so may be during the linear portion of the growth.
ever, the focus of this manuscript was to describe the similarities and
ferences between the species of the whole nestling period. Thus, we used a
atively advanced mixed model method developed by Sofaer et al. (2013) in
ch individual data from all nestlings went in. In the revision we try to
ter explain the random effects that describe differences between individual
tlings and nests. We might use the linear portion of the growth for a more
used analysis in a different manuscript, but for the purpose of the
stions asked here we think the approach used is valid.
overall model analysing growth could provide lot more information than
gle-species (or cross-species) analyses themselves, and they have the
antage of allowing to control for hatch date.
imilar approach could be adopted for feeding rates.
sure what you mean here, for the feeding rates we have done exactly that,
ept that we did not control for brood size, but instead used brood mass as
omposite variable combining brood size and age as a control variable. We
not include hatch date because we had no reason to assume that feeding
es should be affected by the time of year.
In Figs do not abbreviate species names nor use acronyms: they put off
ders. Spell out species names - there is enough space on all graphs.

One section I found too wordy was growth rates (lines 270-290). These

Appendix B
The research article by Goymann and collegues addresses particularly relevant research questions in
the expanding field of parental care. By comparing two closely related and intriguing coucal species,
the authors conclude that the evolution of uniparental care may be favored by the existence of a sex
ratio bias (cf. extra mating opportunities for the rare sex) in combination with favorable
environmental conditions like high food abundance. With their study, the authors confirm theoretical
model predictions of sex roles in mating and parental care. The (correlative) analyses are well
conducted and are based on good sample sizes. The comments I have are rather minor, except for an
extra word about the predictions and subsequent discussion.
In L71-73 and L119-120 the authors indicate that feeding rate and offspring growth is expected to be
higher in biparental, relative to uniparental species. Perhaps an alternative prediction could be added
here, which can be picked up again in the discussion. The alternative would be that parents caring
alone may have higher feeding rates and offspring growth, because they are not directly involved in a
sexual conflict over care. In biparental species, it is expected that this conflict between two caring
parents typically results in overall suboptimal levels of parental care to prevent exploitation by the
mate. This prediction is based on mathematical negotiation models (Lessells & McNamara 2012) and
has been shown empirically in captive zebrafinches (Royle et al. 2002, 2006) and canaries (Iserbyt et
al. 2015).
This prediction, however, holds only under such conditions that each parent has a net equal work
load (i.e. equal number of chicks per parent). Yet, the expected net work load for black coucal males
is twice the net work load for one of the white-browed coucal parents, given the equal mean brood
sizes for both species. Despite this double work load, the results indicate that uniparental black
coucals invest even more than twice the amount of time in provisioning compared to the more
suboptimal investment levels in white-browed coucals (L293-299). This is a situation that is probably
only possible when food supply is super abundant like in the case study, during the rain/breeding
season (as also mentioned several times throughout the manuscript). In my opinion, the alternative
prediction about species differences in food provisioning with and without sexual conflict matches
the results and could be included, at least in the discussion.
Other minor comments:
• L74-86: Perhaps information about the sex ratios for both species can be given too, as it
forms a major part in the discussion.
• L143: add a comma after incubation
• L178: perhaps incubation behavior can be specified. Given the model structure, I guess it is
presence/absence (1/0) data?
• In L327, L336-349 and the heathers of Table 2, 3 and the supplement, 95% confidence
intervals (frequentist approach) are mentioned, whereas it should be credible intervals
(Bayesian approach) according to the methods?
• L463: ‘likely’ instead of ‘unlikely’?
• The lines about sample size in the heather of Table2 are an exact replica of the ones in the
main text. Perhaps it can be shortened in the heather? E.g. the number of data points don’t
really matter in the heather.
Overall, I would like to congratulate the authors with the quality of the manuscript of which I would
recommend publication.

scarcity of uniparental care in birds and the fact that these would not be

o indeed wonder why given your finding female White-browed coucals do not
least try to raise a brood of their own even if they were not going for
yandry. Female shorebirds happily do this of course. This may be worth
nging up in discussion, I guess asking not only why BC have uniparental
e but also asking why white-browed coucals do not.
s is true, and we can only speculate about this. The shorebirds, in which
ales do multiple clutching, only have one breeding attempt per season, I
ss. Maybe the fact that females do not attempt to have their own nest after
viding the male with a clutch is related to the value of a single brood,
ch may be lower in WBCs than in shorebirds with a short breeding season. We
culate about this in the revision of the discussion.
e 427 ff. This is a bit of a chicken and egg thing here is the sex ratio
wed because there is uniparental care or is there uniparental care because
sex ratio is skewed. Unless there is a credible independent reason for a
e biased ADULT sex ratio in BC this argument seems week.
our view it is not so much a chicken and egg problem, but an issue of
itive feedback loops. We have attempted to further develop and clarify this
ue in particular in the following section of the revised version of the
uscript.

e 464. The potential to find additional mates would stop the evolution of

ember that the ancestral trait in coucals is biparental care, and in
trast to migratory shorebirds with a short breeding season an individual
tch may have a lower brood value for white-browed coucals. Hence, selective
ces towards uniparental care may be much lower in coucals than in the
rebird species for which multi-clutching has been found. We have tried to
lement these considerations into the manuscript.
e 482 I am not sure I accept this conclusion that the observed differences
sex roles and care are due to the strength of sexual selection when in fact
ferences in predation rate and the environmental harshness of the plains
ing the dry season are invoked to explain the differences in breeding
sity in the first place.
actually agree with this point of view and have altered the conclusion (and
o the abstract) accordingly.
o wonder whether the two different coucal strategies are not rather just
ways to deal with predation risk. Black coucals use an r strategy vs WBC
ng a K strategy, trying to minimize nest visits maximize vigilance etc.
etailed study of predation patterns maybe using remote cameras may be
rifying this as well as subsequent experimental variation to the nest
dation risk.
tainly, black coucals use more of an r-strategy than white-browed coucals
considering the whole pace of life discussion in tropical birds, white-
wed coucals may be also r-strategists, but certainly less so than black
cals.
e 486 don’t forget fish
we specifically address terrestrial vertebrates because fish are an
irely different case. In most fish with uniparental (and typically male)
ental care the conflict between mating and parental care is relaxed (see
. Kokko and Jennions 2008) because male fish with nests are attractive for
ales. We thus think that the evolution of uniparental care in males of
ds and fish are based on different evolutionary premises.

ments to the Author(s)
authors have made an effort to clarify a number of aspects concerning
hods and sample sizes as well as to adjust terminology when necessary. Both
which were shortcomings of the previous manuscript that have been addressed
. However, I still have a number of queries that still should be dealt
h:
terminology has been changed, however, “parental cooperation” may not be
best choice neither. See e.g. line 14 “to better understand sex
ferences in cooperation”, what is the sex difference referring to? Why not
ng “parental care”? Somewhat below the term “sex roles in parental care” is
d, which would be a good option for the title too.
nged throughout the ms
ase rephrase line 23-24 “We conclude that a food-rich habitat with a benign
mate may be a necessary, but is not a sufficient factor for the evolution
uniparental care”. If just the climate would be relevant more if not all
cies in that habitat should show uni-parentaI care, which is obviously not
case. However, the low levels of care in the bi-parental species suggest
t there is potential to provide more care, which they by whatever reason do
provide. That could be stated more clearly.
have changed the section and hope it is more clear now.
e 182: Please rephrase the term `nuisance variables´. And why are you
ating your covariates differently? E.g. even if time of the day is not
tributing to the model, it is retained, while year is systematically
pped.
rephrased the term. In general, we did not intend to use a step-wise model
uction approach, but tried to frame a meaningful model including variables
t we considered biologically meaningful for the analyses. From a biological
spective and from knowing our study system we did not expect that year or
ian date would have an effect on feeding rates. This is why we called them
isance variables” that we dropped from the model (in fact only included
m to demonstrate the referees that they were not meaningful). The analyses
luding year as a random effect showed that all the random variance was
eady explained by nest ID and parent ID. Including year did not alter
thing. On the other hand, from a biological perspective we would have
ected an effect of day time and hence wanted to include this factor in the
lysis from the beginning and never intended to drop it from the analysis.
rephrased the statistical section to clarify our approach.
e 279-282: Remove? This is quite repetitive, and in case of the parental
spective, it also reverses the argumentation as absence bouts but not
enditure is studied.
changed the section
e 197: Please mention the number and range of feeding visits per nest, as
s is more relevant for the statistics than the time it took to record.
do not quite understand the comment. The number and range of feeding visits
part of the results and can be seen in Fig. 3. We think the referee meant
range for the number and duration of nest observations, and we included
s information in the revision.
e 203: I still disagree with including brood mass instead of nestling age
brood size. Broods may be heavy for a given age because of the quality of
parents. Thus including brood mass then again to explain parental feeding,
ch involves quality differences among parents, is not a good choice I
nk. Second, brood mass is also more likely confounded by species
ferences. This should be corrected.
s is a tricky point. A similar argument could be made for the number of
tlings: High quality parents may raise a larger number of nestlings, which
ld reflect parental feeding ability in a very similar way as brood mass.
since individual nestlings can vary much in age, we can only include
rage nestling age. We decided to keep the analysis with brood mass as a
ariate in the main manuscript, but included a similar analysis replacing
od mass with the number of nestlings and the mean nestling age as a
ariate in a supplementary analysis (now Supplement 1). The results are very
ilar to our original analysis.
e 295-297: This is confusing, please omit. It is furthermore repeated
ow. It is sufficient from my point of view to state that you did not
sure foraging trips in time or length. Given that you didn’t you can’t
te anything else about it.
ge parts of this section were deleted, also following the comments of
eree 6.
e 313: I could not find a description of the statistical procedures
cerning the off-times? And the female black coucals that were part of this
lysis, are these the partners of the male coucals that are part of this
dy?
added a description of the statistical analysis of off-times in the methods
tion.
e 333-334: “both female and male white-browed coucals reached a higher
mptotic body mass than female and male black coucals” Doesn’t that suggest
t male black coucals are, despite the higher effort they make, and despite
unlimited food resources, not able to raise as high quality offspring as
te-browed coucals?
do not think that comparing the asymptotic body mass across species says
h about quality. Adult body size differs between the species, i.e. both
es of white-browed coucals are heavier than male black coucals. In a
vious publication we have stated that female black coucals left the nest at
lowest body mass relative to their adult mass. Body when leaving the nest
responded to 45.7 % of adult body mass in female black coucals, whereas
es fledged at 66.9 % of adult body mass. White-browed coucals fledged at
2 % (females) and 65.8 % (males) of adult body mass. We have inserted these
ults in the figure legend and also mention it in the text of the revision,
it is an important argument for differential male and female mortality
ing juvenile development.
at should be discussed more substantially. In the abstract it is just
ted that “these differences in parental care were not reflected in
spring growth”, which is rather vague. In line 364 onwards it is then
ued that the species do not differ in important growth parameters, which I
d confusing. That is mainly based on k, but asymptotic mass is not
tioned. It is only stated that white browed coucals fledge later, which is
ething different. Including the analysis of tarsus length in the manuscript
in fact be very helpful to understand species differences in growth
jectories and resource allocation to different traits!
expanded the discussion and included more information regarding the
ative adult body mass that coucals reach once they leave the nest. Because
ms is already quite dense in data and because we think that the tarsus
lysis renders very similar results as the body mass data, we would prefer
keep it in the supplement. However, if the editor and the referee think it
ld be useful to move it to the main manuscript we would do so.

ments to the Author(s)
comments and suggestions can be found in the attached letter
research article by Goymann and collegues addresses particularly
evant research questions in the expanding field of parental care. By
paring two closely related and intriguing coucal species, the authors
clude that the evolution of uniparental care may be favored by the
stence of a sex ratio bias (cf. extra mating opportunities for the rare
) in combination with favorable environmental conditions like high food
ndance. With their study, the authors confirm theoretical model
dictions of sex roles in mating and parental care. The (correlative)
lyses are well conducted and are based on good sample sizes. The
ments I have are rather minor, except for an extra word about the
dictions and subsequent discussion.
L71-73 and L119-120 the authors indicate that feeding rate and
spring growth is expected to be higher in biparental, relative to
parental species. Perhaps an alternative prediction could be added
e, which can be picked up again in the discussion. The alternative
ld be that parents caring alone may have higher feeding rates and
spring growth, because they are not directly involved in a sexual
flict over care. In biparental species, it is expected that this
flict between two caring parents typically results in overall
optimal levels of parental care to prevent exploitation by the mate.
s prediction is based on mathematical negotiation models (Lessells &
amara 2012) and has been shown empirically in captive zebrafinches
yle et al. 2002, 2006) and canaries (Iserbyt et al. 2015).
s prediction, however, holds only under such conditions that each
ent has a net equal work load (i.e. equal number of chicks per parent).
, the expected net work load for black coucal males is twice the net
k load for one of the white-browed coucal parents, given the equal mean
od sizes for both species. Despite this double work load, the results
icate that uniparental black coucals invest even more than twice the
unt of time in provisioning compared to the more suboptimal investment
els in white-browed coucals (L293-299). This is a situation that is
bably only possible when food supply is super abundant like in the case
dy, during the rain/breeding season (as also mentioned several times
oughout the manuscript). In my opinion, the alternative prediction
ut species differences in food provisioning with and without sexual
flict matches the results and could be included, at least in the
cussion.
s is a very interesting aspect that we have not considered yet. We
st tried to implement these ideas in the introduction, but found it
ficult to do so without disturbing the flow. We thus followed the
ice of the referee and included this aspect in the discussion.

Reply to referee 2
Original comment of the referee:
It is obviously a difficult task to fulfill the requests of different referees, I can imagine. However, I have
with the current version of the manuscript the impression that a number of insertion are rather
repetitive or distracting, given also that the initial submission was well-written. So - as a final task -
carefully evaluating and removing overlap between sections would strongly benefit the manuscript, as
well as trying to make better links with newly inserted parts. I give some examples of sections that
could be improved below.
Our response:
This is true. We went through the ms carefully again and tried to reestablish the flow where it had
gotten lost.
Referee: Some additional suggestions:
Line 46 and 50: Please delete “also”.
Our response
done
Referee: Line 74-82: This new paragraph does not link well with the previous paragraph. Maybe, delete
line 74-75, starting then with: “We hypothesize that a larger required effort…”. And it may be redundant
as most of its content will be repeated e.g. line 126 onwards.
Our response:
We have rephrased the section and therefore improved the flow.
Referee: Line 206-207: It is, still, unclear for me why hatch date or year are not biologically meaningful,
there is ample evidence for both. So this statement should be deleted.
Our response:
We have rephrased the statement, but maintain it in the ms, because we had included it in response to
a query from another reviewer. We think that hatch date and year do not have a biologically meaningful
influence in our case because the environmental conditions, in particular the ambient temperatures are
stable and similar between the years. Hence, you cannot compare these tropical birds to arctic or
temperate species, where environmental conditions vary from year to year and during the season and
influence incubation patterns.
Referee: Line 372: typo: thy
Our response:
Changed
Referee: Line 370-74; very similar to line 412-415
Our response:
Lines 370-74 report a result, whereas lines 412ff. discuss these results. We do not see a necessity to
change this.
Referee: Line 497 onwards: this section is rather similar to the section on positive feedback loops in the
introduction. Maybe an option to shorten it here or in the introduction.
Our response:
We have modified and shortened line 497ff, but kept the main argument, which indeed picks up a topic
from the introduction. This is however necessary in the light of the following discussion of the data that
come from white-browed coucals.
Referee: Supplement: Data on tarsus could be integrated in table 2, and adding the statistical outcome
to the main manuscript does not add more than 1-2 sentences.
Our response:
Unfortunately, to fully address the tarsus data we would need to add at least a full new paragraph.
present the data on tarsus length in 1-2 sentences. We prefer to keep the tarsus data in full length in
the supplement. They support the data on body mass, but do not provide additional arguments, hence
we think it is justified to place them in a supplement.
Referee: I also suggest to decide for one feeding rate analysis rather than leaving the choice to the
reader, that is a bit odd. I have previously argued that brood mass may be more confounded by species
differences. If keeping brood mass you should thus test the species * brood mass interaction. In any
case all data could be integrated in the main file, which I think should be aimed at.
Our response:
In our view we demonstrate a clear preference for the brood mass analysis, which is expressed by the
fact that we placed it into the main manuscript and the alternative analysis into the supplement. We do
not see why it would be odd to present this alternative in the supplement and instead decide on one of
the analyses? We did both analyses to convince the referees and the future reader that if brood mass
was replaced by number of nestlings and mean age of nestlings the analysis would render very similar
results. This is not leaving the choice to the reader, this is convincing the reader that the analyses are
robust, regardless of what kind of control variables are used to control for the stage and size of the
brood. Given the robustness of the analysis we also do not see a necessity to introduce an interaction
term between species and brood mass, which in our view would represent an unnecessary complication.
