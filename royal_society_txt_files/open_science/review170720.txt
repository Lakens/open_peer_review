This paper investigates how mountain gorillas, a non-territorial species, partitions space use,
chooses the area they want to move to, and to what degree they exclusively use some part of their
home range. The authors use a large data set of 10 groups, that shows extensive sampling effort,
and well-done statistics to show that gorillas maintain relatively exclusive access to their core
areas and that this may occur due to mutual avoidance. In general, I thought this paper was quite
good. I really like the idea of investigating mutual space use by groups with overlapping home
ranges and I don’t think it is done enough. I have made some comments below to improve the
manuscript but overall I think it will be a nice addition to the literature.
The Introduction is mostly fine but it could be improved with a bit more information on what
makes a species territorial versus non-territorial. Lines 45-55 hop between these two concepts and
it would be nice to have a few lines about what determines whether a species will behave
territorially. In addition, mutual use of shared areas by these animals is presumably causing
between-group scramble competition. Thus, in some ways the authors are actually measuring
between-group scramble. This is a slippery topic that is hard to measure but the authors should
at least mention and define it in the Introduction.
In the Methods, I have two main issues. In lines 154-157, I really wondered about the impact of
unhabituated groups on the results. I was glad to see that they were acknowledged on line 229.
However, I think that the authors could further demonstrate that these groups did not impact the
results severely if they discussed more about how many unhabituated groups there were, what
their group size was, and where they ranged relative to the study groups. Larger groups and
those that range in the middle of habituated groups would certainly have more of an effect on the
results than smaller groups or those that range at the edges of the ranges of habituated groups.
I also kept wondering throughout the Methods, how the authors accounted for the fact that
gorillas on the edge of 500 x 500 m quadrat are much more likely to visit the close adjoining
quadrat rather than other surrounding ones. So, the current location largely determines the next
location. The authors explain that they controlled for the probability of entering nearby quadrats
in S9 but I think a line addressing this in the main text’s Methods is also warranted to ease
reader’s minds.
In the Discussion, the authors present their case for gorilla groups avoiding one another. While I
don’t disagree with this interpretation, mate defense by males could also work to keep other
groups out of a certain area and indirectly defend food for females (i.e., the hired-guns
hypothesis, Rubenstein, 1986). Male mate defense is alluded to in the Conclusions but more
information on this and the form that between-group encounters take would be good in the
Discussion. For instance, chest beats are noted on lines 398-403 as a potential spacing mechanism
but no context is provided for how often these are actually made within and outside of a between
group encounter situation.
Minor comments:
L 24-25 – Change “to choose” to “choosing”.
L 26-28 – This sentence is quite awkward. Consider rephrasing.
L 27-29 – This part about core areas does not really flow from what is above.
L 30 – Pluralize “suggest”.
L 30 – I’m not sure if “features” is the best word here… “aspects” may be better.
L 40 – Change “such” to “space use”.
L 40-41 – Between-group dominance is another important factor determining space use that
should be mentioned. The distribution of neighbors may not matter if you are a dominant group.
3
L 45 – This is not a good definition of home range. Consider changing “spacing pattern of” to
“overall area used by a group from sequential”.
L 72 – What is the range of home-range overlap seen? Please put in parentheses for the reader.
L 72 – Delete “both”.
L 89 – Delete the first “the”.
L 93 – Delete “the”.
L 100-105 – This is a really long sentence that would be clearer if it was portioned somehow.
Perhaps with numbers.
L 108 – Delete “the”.
L 109 – “both responses” is not clear. What responses?
L 152 – Add “that” after “showed”.
L 155 – Add a colon and “1)” after “both”.
L 156 – Add a semi-colon after “groups” and “2)” after “and”.
L 172 – Change “tested” to “examined”.
L 211 – What two variables? Please state again.
L 220 – Add “As a composite measure of previous use,“ before “For each group”.
L 333 – Change “the” to “some” since not all test predictors were significant.
L 339 - Change “the” to “some” since not all test predictors were significant.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In the Introduction, the hypotheses come after the predictions and are interwoven with
methodology and justification of methods. He Introduction needs to be restructured considerably
so that the theoretical expectations are placed first, then specific hypotheses, and then specific
predictions based on the methods used. All detail on the methodology needs to be moved and
discussed in the Methods section. I am curious why this study uses a grid cell usage method and
4
not the actual GPS locations and distances. Is there no data on the breadth of impact of a foraging
group or the detection distances of another group’s activity? Such data should be used to justify
the use of a 500 by 500 m grid system as it seems to infer that individual foraging impacts a rather
large radius than I would have expected. This methodology should also be detailed in the
Methods section and not in the Introduction section.
The writing needs considerable editing, so that I was quite confused in several sections. For
example, the Abstract need to be carefully edited as many of the sentences, although
understandable, are not well written. For example: “The probability of a group to choose an area
was positively influenced by both food availability and the previous use of that area by the
group.” Should read: The probability that a group chose an area was positively influenced by
both food availability and the previous use of that area by the group. The statistical analyses were
especially confusedly written and in need of clarification and simplification. This detracted
considerably from the overall perspective and focus of the paper and resulted in lengthy methods
section and an abbreviated discussion.
Paragraph on lines 80 to 91 give summary results as statements from manuscript in review. This
approach is always problematic as this information has not been reviewed and published and
may not be acceptable and deemed publishable by the journal cited. This could lead to a situation
where the statements in this article are published, but are not substantiated anywhere else. In this
case, it is complex because the information is interesting and relevant, but I think it is best to
leave this information out unless the article referred to is accepted and can be cited as in press.
The results of this study are important and I would like to learn more about this study, but I need
a more carefully edited version before I am sure of my understanding.

Comments to the Author:
While reviewer 1 generally agrees with the quality of the manuscript, reviewer 2 found it
confusing and preferred not to comment on the statistical methods and other details before a
revised version is available. Although I felt that I could follow the manuscript, I clearly could see
the reviewer’s point and encourage the authors to spend some more effort on optimizing the
presentation of their study. Specifically, I suggest to include the linear models in R syntax in
supplementary S9 (or even in the main text) – for many readers, this may be the most accessible
representation of the analysis.

clear to them. Following that, we edited these parts accordingly (lines 18-20, 24-29, 38-39, 59-
72-76, 100-115, 122-129, 136-138, 166-168, 218-222, 225-230, 236-241, 245-247, 257-261,

, 745-748). Furthermore, to improve the presentation of the statistical model, we included the
yntax of our models in the supplementary material S7 and refer to it in the main text (lines 253-
and 269-270).

s paper investigates how mountain gorillas, a non-territorial species, partitions space use,
oses the area they want to move to, and to what degree they exclusively use some part of their
me range. The authors use a large data set of 10 groups, that shows extensive sampling effort,
well-done statistics to show that gorillas maintain relatively exclusive access to their core areas
that this may occur due to mutual avoidance. In general, I thought this paper was quite good.
ally like the idea of investigating mutual space use by groups with overlapping home ranges
I don’t think it is done enough. I have made some comments below to improve the manuscript
overall I think it will be a nice addition to the literature.
thank the reviewer very much for this positive feedback on our study! We agree that mutual
ce use by groups with overlapping home ranges has been a neglected topic and hope that readers
l find our results interesting.
The Introduction is mostly fine but it could be improved with a bit more information on what
kes a species territorial versus non-territorial. Lines 45-55 hop between these two concepts and
would be nice to have a few lines about what determines whether a species will behave
itorially. In addition, mutual use of shared areas by these animals is presumably causing
ween-group scramble competition. Thus, in some ways the authors are actually measuring
ween-group scramble. This is a slippery topic that is hard to measure but the authors should at
t mention and define it in the Introduction.
thank the reviewer very much for these suggestions. We now define territoriality and we added
re information on what causes a species to exhibit territorial behavior (lines 45-58).
thermore, we now mention and define between-group scramble competition in the Introduction
es 67-69).
n the Methods, I have two main issues. In lines 154-157, I really wondered about the impact of
abituated groups on the results. I was glad to see that they were acknowledged on line 229.
wever, I think that the authors could further demonstrate that these groups did not impact the
ults severely if they discussed more about how many unhabituated groups there were, what their
up size was, and where they ranged relative to the study groups. Larger groups and those that
ge in the middle of habituated groups would certainly have more of an effect on the results than
aller groups or those that range at the edges of the ranges of habituated groups.
agree with the reviewer that more information on the unhabituated groups is necessary.
erall, we believe that the unhabituated groups did not have an effect on our results. To address
issue, we added more information on the number of unhabituated groups to the Methods (lines
-193 and 301-303). We added how many unhabituated groups were found in the park-wide
sus in 2011 (one year before our study) within the study groups’ home ranges and we report
r group sizes. Additionally, we now show two maps in the supplementary material S4, which
icate the approximate home ranges of the unhabituated groups as well as the study group’s
me ranges and core areas, respectively. In 2011, nest sites of only three unhabituated groups
e found in the periphery of the 2012-2013 annual home ranges of some study groups, but no
2
t sites were found in the study groups’ core areas. Therefore, we assumed that the unhabituated
ups did not bias our results.
I also kept wondering throughout the Methods, how the authors accounted for the fact that
illas on the edge of 500 x 500 m quadrat are much more likely to visit the close adjoining
drat rather than other surrounding ones. So, the current location largely determines the next
ation. The authors explain that they controlled for the probability of entering nearby quadrats
9 but I think a line addressing this in the main text’s Methods is also warranted to ease reader’s
ds.
agree with the reviewer that the current location may have an influence on the next location.
wever, to control for the issues raised by the reviewer, we would need to quantify the
babilities of gorillas to visit the adjoining cells depending on the current location within a cell,
ch obviously is not trivial (particularly given that we could not collect data about group spread).
s is why we refrained from following this suggestion further. However, we do not think that
introduces a systematic error. We added some information concerning this issue to the
thods (lines 250-255).
wever, we controlled for several other related issues. We controlled for for the non-
ependence of choices as each time only one of the surrounding cells can be chosen by including
ice ID (lines 237-241). Additionally, we controlled for the fact that the probability that a group
se one of the four directly adjacent cells was higher than the probability that a group chose a
bordering the corner of the original cell (please see also supplementary material S7 and figure
. We added this information to the Methods (lines 247-250).
n the Discussion, the authors present their case for gorilla groups avoiding one another. While
on’t disagree with this interpretation, mate defense by males could also work to keep other
ups out of a certain area and indirectly defend food for females (i.e., the hired-guns hypothesis,
benstein, 1986). Male mate defense is alluded to in the Conclusions but more information on
and the form that between-group encounters take would be good in the Discussion. For
ance, chest beats are noted on lines 398-403 as a potential spacing mechanism but no context
rovided for how often these are actually made within and outside of a between group encounter
ation.
thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer that mate defense may be
underlying rationale for the observed avoidance behaviour among neighbouring groups. We
e added one paragraph to the discussion about the ‘hired gun’ strategy. We now discuss the
sibility of gorilla males using displays and chest beating during intergroup encounters to drive
ay extragroup competitors from a certain area, thereby indirectly defending high-quality food
ources for the females. We also added more information about intergroup encounters and chest
ts in gorillas (lines 410-412 and 416-430).
nor comments:
L 24-25 – Change “to choose” to “choosing”.

L 27-29 – This part about core areas does not really flow from what is above.
edited this part (lines 27-29):
sum, our results show that both foraging needs and avoidance of competition with neighbours
ermined the gorillas’ daily movement decisions, which presumably lead to largely mutually
lusive core areas.”
L 30 – Pluralize “suggest”.

L 30 – I’m not sure if “features” is the best word here… “aspects” may be better.
have now changed this (line 30) and in the Discussion (lines 407 and 436).
L 40 – Change “such” to “space use”.
changed this (line 40).
L 40-41 – Between-group dominance is another important factor determining space use that
uld be mentioned. The distribution of neighbors may not matter if you are a dominant group.
thank the reviewer for pointing that out. As between-group dominance is part of between-
up competition, we now mention between-group competition when talking about the effect of
ghbours in territorial species (lines 39-42):
r territorial animals, in which territory owners actively exclude conspecifics from fixed areas,
ce use patterns are largely determined by the distribution of neighbours resulting from between-
up competition (Mosser & Packer 2009, Roth & Cords 2016, Harris 2006) and peripheral areas
he territory are often underused.”
L 45 – This is not a good definition of home range. Consider changing “spacing pattern of” to
erall area used by a group from sequential”.
changed this into (lines 45-46):
home range is the overall area used by a group and arises from sequential daily movement
isions.”
L 72 – What is the range of home-range overlap seen? Please put in parentheses for the reader.
added that home range overlap in mountain gorillas ranges from 13% to 100% (line 83).

In the Introduction, the hypotheses come after the predictions and are interwoven with
hodology and justification of methods. The Introduction needs to be restructured considerably
that the theoretical expectations are placed first, then specific hypotheses, and then specific
dictions based on the methods used. All detail on the methodology needs to be moved and
cussed in the Methods section.
edited the Introduction to first present the theoretical expectations and then our specific
dictions. We removed details on our methodology from the Introduction. The last paragraph of
Introduction was edited and now only contains our objectives, hypotheses and predictions
es 56-58, 63-77, 100-115). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we placed the prediction about
ce partitioning on the annual scale at the end of the last paragraph (lines 113-115). To maintain
order, please note that we re-ordered the Methods and Results accordingly with the daily
vement decision being first now and the annual overlap being last.
I am curious why this study uses a grid cell usage method and not the actual GPS locations
distances. Is there no data on the breadth of impact of a foraging group or the detection
ances of another group’s activity? Such data should be used to justify the use of a 500 by 500
grid system as it seems to infer that individual foraging impacts a rather large radius than I
uld have expected. This methodology should also be detailed in the Methods section and not in
Introduction section.
thank the reviewer for raising these issues. We now justify the use of the grid cell method in
supplementary material S1 to not add additional information to the already detailed Method
tion but refer to it in the main text (lines 152-153).
added the following infomration to the supplementary material S1:
chosen grid cell size was a compromise between spatial resolution and feasibility. However,
ng this approach, we followed a protocol from a previous study investigating the spatial and
poral availability of herbaceous vegetation consumed by gorillas in Bwindi. It found that the
tial availability of gorilla food species differed significantly among habitat types (Ganas et al.
9). Hence, this method seems to be appropriate to reflect spatial variability in herbaceous food
ilability.
ditionally, a previous study on daily travel distances in Bwindi gorillas found that they move
average 808 m per day (range: 547-1034 m; Ganas & Robbins 2005). Hence, a cell roughly
resents the area used for the daily foraging activities of a group.
decision to do the vegetation sampling on a 500 x 500 m grid cell basis lead to the estimates
orilla food availability being estimates per 500 x 500 m cell. Hence, all GPS points within such
ell would get the same food availability estimate, which would not allow testing the effect of
iation in herbaceous food availability but be redundant.
The writing needs considerable editing, so that I was quite confused in several sections. For
mple, the Abstract need to be carefully edited as many of the sentences, although
erstandable, are not well written. For example: “The probability of a group to choose an area
positively influenced by both food availability and the previous use of that area by the group.”
uld read: The probability that a group chose an area was positively influenced by both food
ilability and the previous use of that area by the group.

improve the presentation of our study, two scientists who were unfamiliar with this study were
ed to read the manuscript and indicate parts that were not clear to them. In addition to the
ady mentioned parts of the Introduction, we edited more parts in the Introduction, Results and
cussion accordingly to improve the presentation of our study (lines 18-20, 24-29, 38-39, 59-
326-328, 329-331, 364-367, 389-390, 392-394, 397, 415, 436, 451, 704-706, 708-710, 727-
, 745-748).
The statistical analyses were especially confusedly written and in need of clarification and
plification. This detracted considerably from the overall perspective and focus of the paper and
ulted in lengthy methods section and an abbreviated discussion.
are sorry if we were not clear in the presentation of our statistical analyses. We agree with the
iewer that the methods part is partially extensive and hence we moved some methodological
ails to the supplementary material S3 and S7 to make this part simpler. We refer to them in the
n text (lines 218-222, 267-268).
ddition to the already mentioned editing of the ms based on the suggestions of two scientists
o were unfamiliar with this study, we also edited parts of the Methods to be clearer (lines 122-
, 136-138, 166-168, 218-222, 225-230, 236-241, 245-247, 257-261, 285).
ditionally, as also suggested by the Associate Editor, we included the R syntax of our models
he supplementary material S7 and refer to it in the main text text (lines 253-254 and 269-270).
wever, we believe that a thorough description of the methods and analyses is essential in judging
ether results are robust and hence, we think presenting details on the methods is essential.
Paragraph on lines 80 to 91 give summary results as statements from manuscript in review.
s approach is always problematic as this information has not been reviewed and published and
y not be acceptable and deemed publishable by the journal cited. This could lead to a situation
ere the statements in this article are published, but are not substantiated anywhere else. In this
e, it is complex because the information is interesting and relevant, but I think it is best to leave
information out unless the article referred to is accepted and can be cited as in press.
thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments on this. We agree with the reviewer that the
ults of the study in review are not yet substantiated, but the information is relevant to this study.
refore, we removed some references in the introduction when other comparable information
already available (lines 92-93, 281-283). However, we think that the results of the study in
iew are important for the interpretation of the results of this study as they nicely complement
h other and a bigger picture of gorilla space use emerges. Hence, we decided to keep some
rences in the Introduction (lines 94-96), Methods (line 133) and Discussion (lines 391-392,
-401). Please note that we have given this manuscript in review a reference number like all
er literature references.
results of this study are important and I would like to learn more about this study, but I need
ore carefully edited version before I am sure of my understanding.

nuscript and have clarified what we did, how and why we did it.

manuscript is greatly improved with revisions but the abstract and Introduction contain major
ting issues where the English used appears to set up logical fallacies, but this is clearly (to me)
misused terminology - I have corrected these to (hopefully) fit the authors intended meaning
he attached copy - my apologies that I was without technology when I did these corrections and
pe my handwriting is clear!
thank the reviewer very much for the valuable input. We have changed the manuscript based
the reviewer’s suggestions.
stract:
We rephrased the first sentence in the Abstract (lines 18-20):
territorial species, the distribution of neighbours and food abundance play a crucial role in
ce use patterns but less is known about how and when neighbours use shared areas in non-
itorial species.’
s we agree with the reviewer that the Abstract suggested some active avoidance, which we do
want to suggest, we rephrased the sentence (lines 29-31):
r research suggests that non-territorial species actively avoid neighbours to maintain core
a exclusivity.’
oduction:
ollowing the suggestion of the reviewer, we rephrased the first paragraph of the Introduction
es 38-43).
1
We exchanged ‘arises’ with ‘results’ (line 44).
We also adapted the part on territoriality in the introduction according to the changes suggested
the reviewer (lines 49-54).
To avoid repetition, we removed sentences as suggested by the reviewer but included a new
sition sentence (lines 60-62):
imals with overlapping home ranges need to adjust their spacing patterns to maximize foraging
ciency, but at the same time they need to minimize negative effects of between-group
petition.’
We changed the definition of between-group scramble competition into (line 64):
ere resources are exploited by the group that arrives first.’
Following the suggestions of the reviewer, we rephrased the sentences on the relationship
ween home range overlap and intergroup encounters and removed any repetition (lines 68-71).
We rephrased the part on gorilla intergroup encounters as suggested by the reviewer (lines 85-
.
We changed the phrasing of our predictions following the reviewer’s suggestions but changed
se to past tense (lines 94-95, 97-99 and 101-103).
thods:
We rephrased the sentence on data collection when not following the gorillas directly (line
-118):
llowing the trails gave data on distance travelled in an area but not temporal use of an area.’
We restructured the first sentence of the paragraph about ‘Herbaceous food availability per
d cell’ (line 131):
rbaceous food availability per grid cell was measured as the energy density of herb species…’
We changed ‘previous use of groups and of neighbouring groups’ into ’previous use by groups
by neighbouring groups’ (line 183).
We replaced ‘Probability to choose a particular area’ with ‘Probability of choosing a
ticular area’ (lines 194 and 213).
2
We replaced ‘probability that they/gorillas/a group chose’ with ‘probability that
y/gorillas/a group would choose’ (lines 214, 236, 237).
ults:
We replaced ‘Probability to choose a particular area’ with ‘Probability of choosing a
ticular area’ (line 314, Figure 2 and Table 2).
We replaced ‘probability that a group chose’ with ‘probability that a group would choose’
e 315 and 729).
We replaced ‘as’ with ‘when’ (line 320).
cussion:
We removed a phrase (line377) and rephrased part of the sentence as suggested by the reviewer
e 383).
plementary Information:
M_S6: We replaced ‘probability that a group chose’ with ‘probability that a group would
ose’.
M_S7: We replaced ‘probability to choose a particular area’ and ‘probability that
y/gorillas/a group’ with ‘probability of choosing a particular area’ and ‘probability that
y/gorillas/a group would choose’, respectively.
M_S10: We replaced ‘Probability to choose a particular area’ and ‘probability that Bwindi
untain gorilla groups chose’ with ‘Probability of choosing a particular area’ and ‘probability
t Bwindi mountain gorilla groups would choose’, respectively.
M_S11: We replaced ‘Probability to choose a particular area’ and ‘probability that Bwindi
untain gorilla groups chose’ with ‘Probability of choosing a particular area’ and ‘probability
t Bwindi mountain gorilla groups would choose’, respectively.
top of the suggestions by the reviewer, we restructured the Abstract in such a way that it follows
same order as the manuscript. We apologize for not realizing this when submitting the first
ised version. In the newly revised manuscript, we now present the daily movement decisions
t and then the annual home range and core area overlap (lines 21-27). Please note that we did
change the content.
3
tly, we exchanged ‘density of neighbouring gorillas’ with ‘local gorilla population density’ in
manuscript in review based on the suggestion of a reviewer (lines 89-90 and 380-381).
