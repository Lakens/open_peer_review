The paper studies an interesting issue of cooperation formation among fishers. However, they do
not consider adequate methods in their study. So in short they claim to achieve more than their
model is capable of. I would suggest the authors either being honest what their paper is about or
invite an Economist and/or game-theorist to work with them to achieve their research questions.
To begin with they could familiarise themselves to the relevant literature before studying the
issue.

OVERALL
I found this paper to be a breath of fresh air in a field that rarely marries interviews about
behavior with models of information sharing. While some parts of the writeup could be more
clear and detailed, the paper is worthy of publication.
MAJOR
I found the description of the model to be too cursory: it should not be necessary to read another
paper to understand how the model works in this paper. The key is not to repeat all the
equations, but to repeat the general motivation, assumptions, and how the model works. In
particular, not enough space is devoted to how differences in agents emerge: are agents all equal
at the start but some are luckier than others, or are agents intrinsically better or worse throughout
(see the debate over whether some fishermen are better than others). In addition, are the
simulations over one season or over multiple seasons?
Two reviewers highlight game theory. While related to this manuscript, I agree with the authors
that this is beyond the scope of the paper itself. However, what would be very interesting would
be a more complete paragraph or two in the discussion about how the results might feed into
3
game theory, e.g. armed with this information, how might it play out in the future: would most
fishers choose to share more or less, and gradually over time would this result in the entire
fishery sharing everything? Also of interest would be a tournament style simulation where
different strategies could compete that choose to explore vs. share information at different levels.
A paper outlining this: Rendell et al. (2010) would be a very interesting model to adapt to a
fisheries context.
In lines 50-115 the introduction is overtaken by methods, results and discussion, and conclusions.
It’s OK to have a short paragraph outlining what you plan to do, but this goes far beyond that.
Any bits starting with “we show that”, for example, are premature at this point.
270 “the successful agent sees a 15% decline in CPUE”. From the previous descriptions of the
model, I don’t see how this is actually true. Is it true that the individual agent that is most
successful at low <U+03BB> is the same agent most successful at high <U+03BB>? Or are all agents
interchangeable? In other words, are some people better at fishing always, or is it random who
does the best depending on random factors like where they happen to fish? I thought in the
model that all agents are interchangeable. In other words there is a probability that you do better,
and that probability goes up with higher information sharing, but never reaches 100% because
there is always the chance that in a particular simulation you did really well at low information
sharing but badly at high information sharing. I don’t think the white dots represent the exact
same agents in Figure 1a,b for example. As far as I can tell, although CPUE varies among agents,
there is no preset CPUE level for a particular agent. For example, if I do badly (compared to
others) this year with high information sharing, will I still do badly next year (relative to others) if
I choose low information sharing? If this is built-in, then I agree with the results here, if not, then I
disagree. So the question not explicitly addressed is this: are agents equally good a priori, or is
there an inherent difference in their ability to find and catch fish?
Figure 3: because the optimal area is shaded, it cannot be compared to the other areas in the plot,
because the colors are different. Better to delineate the optimal area as being within some lines,
rather than shading it. Additionally, while you can see where some objectives dominate over
others, you can’t see where all objectives are high (and equal) compared to low (and equal). It
might be better to have four plots: one for equity showing colors from white (low) to bright blue
(high), one for profit, one for stability, and then a fourth one showing high overall average of the
three or sum of the three. Alternatively a plot where each individual square has the three colors
going from 0 to 1, so they can all be high or all low.
One point to consider in a world where fuel use also has climate change implications: is there a
difference in fuel use between TACs and ITQs?
A note about writing up interviews. It is really powerful to write out individual interview
anecdotes, rather than general summaries of what was said in the interviews. A classic paper
doing this is Holland (2008).
MINOR
In the cover page, author “Watson” is spelled as “Watsom”.
36 “classic examples” should be “classic example”
66-67 remove the (1) and (2) here.
80 remove “yet” since this sentence is not the opposite of the previous sentence.
92 “for majority” should be “for the majority”
4
183-185 I don’t quite follow this: why should fish be replenished when they are being depleted by
fishing? That doesn’t make sense. Do the authors mean “diminished” instead of “replenished”?
220 It is not clear at this point whether “simulation period” refers to catches within a fishing
season, or catches over a long period of multiple years.
245 I don’t think the scenario of inexhaustible fish is very realistic, especially when exploring
scenarios of information sharing that would deliberately lead to depletion and competition
among vessels. With no depletion, there is effectively no penalty for telling everyone else where
the schools are, since your own catches are not affected. In lines 254-255 it get confusing, because
here it says that schools either move away quickly or are depleted quickly. Which is it? No
depletion, or depletion?
262 A gentle suggestion here and elsewhere: rather than saying “even at <U+03BB> = 1”, why not refer to
“complete information sharing”, then the reader does not have to keep remembering what the
parameter means.
321 “TACs is better” should be “TACs are better”
Figure 3: how can target species mobility be negative? They can’t be more than stationary (0).
406 “those less successful” should be “less successful”.
443-445 This sentence needs rewording.
448-451 This final sentence is just a little too long and complicated.
495 “no data was” should be “no data were”.

ponse:
me theoretic analysis has been suggested by previous reviewers, and there is indeed a large
rature on economic cooperation, but these works most often start with assumptions on the
e's payoffs and how they depend on external factors such as variability in natural resources.
r goal in this manuscript lies upstream from economic game theoretic analyses: we wish to
ke a statement about how ecological dynamics shape payoffs in the first place. We identify
es where there is no social dilemma, and therefore no additional social dynamics is going to
duce a different result than that of group optimization. We also find settings which do exhibit
ocial dilemma, and this is enough to suggest a range of counter-intuitive management
comes and inter-community variation. This was initially suggested to us by our interviews,
ch provided early motivation for this study.
mmitting to a precise economic model would be making an additional claim about our ability
redict the social dynamics that ensue once the dilemma is in place. But the degree of inter-
munity variation we found in our interviews shows that these outcomes are diverse and
plex; instead it seems better for us to focus on the (largely unexplored) ecological-human
nection, and leave to further work the task of understanding the purely social dynamics that
ow.
have addressed the text to include this further clarification.

und this paper to be a breath of fresh air in a field that rarely marries interviews about
avior with models of information sharing. While some parts of the writeup could be more
ar and detailed, the paper is worthy of publication.
ponse:
very much agree on the need to combine qualitative and other information with quantitative
dels. We greatly appreciate the positive response from this reviewer.
mment:
und the description of the model to be too cursory: it should not be necessary to read another
er to understand how the model works in this paper. The key is not to repeat all the equations,
to repeat the general motivation, assumptions, and how the model works. In particular, not
ugh space is devoted to how differences in agents emerge: are agents all equal at the start but
e are luckier than others, or are agents intrinsically better or worse throughout (see the debate
r whether some fishermen are better than others). In addition, are the simulations over one
son or over multiple seasons?
ponse:
have clarified the intent with which the model was developed and the assumptions we made.
articular, simulations corresponded to one season and agents were intrinsically equal. The
soning for this is that other sources of inequality (economic advantage accrued over seasons,
difference in skill) could always be added on, but they would not interact in an unpredictable
y with spatial dynamics. The only aspects that required explicit spatial modeling were the
rch process, and how it interacts with information sharing and catch limitations. See also our
ly below to the comment regarding line 270.
mment:
o reviewers highlight game theory. While related to this manuscript, I agree with the authors
this is beyond the scope of the paper itself. However, what would be very interesting would
a more complete paragraph or two in the discussion about how the results might feed into
e theory, e.g. armed with this information, how might it play out in the future: would most
ers choose to share more or less, and gradually over time would this result in the entire
ery sharing everything? Also of interest would be a tournament style simulation where
erent strategies could compete that choose to explore vs. share information at different levels.
aper outlining this: Rendell et al. (2010) would be a very interesting model to adapt to a
eries context.
ponse:
have added a discussion paragraph on how our results can inform game theoretic
roaches, and why we did not do it: the diversity of social behaviors emerging from our
rviews suggested that the purely social aspect of these dynamics was very complex in itself,
would require dedicated work to be represented accurately. We have included this comment
hat part of the discussion, and thank this reviewer for this thoughtful inquiry.
mment:
ines 50-115 the introduction is overtaken by methods, results and discussion, and
clusions. It’s OK to have a short paragraph outlining what you plan to do, but this goes far
ond that. Any bits starting with “we show that”, for example, are premature at this point.
ponse:
agree with this comment and have addressed the Introduction as recommended.
mment:
“the successful agent sees a 15% decline in CPUE”. From the previous descriptions of the
del, I don’t see how this is actually true. Is it true that the individual agent that is most
cessful at low <U+03BB> is the same agent most successful at high <U+03BB>? Or are all agents
rchangeable? In other words, are some people better at fishing always, or is it random who
s the best depending on random factors like where they happen to fish? I thought in the
del that all agents are interchangeable. In other words there is a probability that you do better,
that probability goes up with higher information sharing, but never reaches 100% because
re is always the chance that in a particular simulation you did really well at low information
ring but badly at high information sharing. I don’t think the white dots represent the exact
e agents in Figure 1a,b for example. As far as I can tell, although CPUE varies among
nts, there is no preset CPUE level for a particular agent. For example, if I do badly (compared
thers) this year with high information sharing, will I still do badly next year (relative to
ers) if I choose low information sharing? If this is built-in, then I agree with the results here, if
, then I disagree. So the question not explicitly addressed is this: are agents equally good a
ri, or is there an inherent difference in their ability to find and catch fish?
ponse:
have tried to amend the previous manuscript's ambiguity on this point. Throughout, we
lyze the potential social dilemma that arises from heterogeneous outcomes between agents.
s then takes two possible interpretations: if the heterogeneity comes from fixed skill
erences, then the dilemma will hold between skilled and unskilled agents. If, however, the
erogeneity comes from chance, then the dilemma holds between (risk-seeking) agents
imizing for maximal gain, and (risk-averse) agents optimizing for minimal loss. Even if the
st successful agent changes from run to run, a risk-seeking agent will optimize as if they were
ays going to be the most successful.
wever, the former (skill-based differences) is not affected by resource depletion or by the
es of management action we represented, and therefore could not explain their impact.
nce, we spend more time discussing the latter (risk-based differences), since it contains the
e basic intuitions (e.g. no matter whether from skill or chance, heterogeneity decreases as
ring increases), but exhibits a larger dependence on ecological factors and management.
haps the most realistic version of this dilemma would be between risk-averse agents and
ected profit maximizers instead, as we now comment in the discussion; taking the extreme of
-seeking agents simply amplifies the patterns but does not alter them qualitatively.

ure 3: because the optimal area is shaded, it cannot be compared to the other areas in the plot,
ause the colors are different. Better to delineate the optimal area as being within some lines,
er than shading it. Additionally, while you can see where some objectives dominate over
ers, you can’t see where all objectives are high (and equal) compared to low (and equal). It
ht be better to have four plots: one for equity showing colors from white (low) to bright blue
h), one for profit, one for stability, and then a fourth one showing high overall average of the
e or sum of the three. Alternatively, a plot where each individual square has the three colors
ng from 0 to 1, so they can all be high or all low.
ponse:
have updated figure 3 in response to this comment.
mment:
e point to consider in a world where fuel use also has climate change implications: is there a
erence in fuel use between TACs and ITQs?
ponse:
agree that there are additional outside impacts with the potential to alter outcomes, and
tainly the implications of climate change on fuel is a good one. This is an important question
mpacts of such additional influences are critical, and we hope to engage this in future work.
mment:
ote about writing up interviews. It is really powerful to write out individual interview
cdotes, rather than general summaries of what was said in the interviews. A classic paper
ng this is Holland (2008).
ponse:
agree that individual anecdotes can be powerful. However, we explicitly stated in our
sent forms that the interviews were being conducted to inform our hypotheses and model, and
refore would only be used as summaries and would not be used or reported by individual. We
include a bit more detail in our Supplementary Material.

-185 I don’t quite follow this: why should fish be replenished when they are being depleted
fishing? That doesn’t make sense. Do the authors mean “diminished” instead of
plenished”?
agree the wording is confusing and have updated this for clarity.
It is not clear at this point whether “simulation period” refers to catches within a fishing
son, or catches over a long period of multiple years.
r “simulation period” is a fishing season, and we have edited the text to clarify this point.
I don’t think the scenario of inexhaustible fish is very realistic, especially when exploring
narios of information sharing that would deliberately lead to depletion and competition
ong vessels. With no depletion, there is effectively no penalty for telling everyone else where
schools are, since your own catches are not affected. In lines 254-255 it gets confusing,
ause here it says that schools either move away quickly or are depleted quickly. Which is it?
depletion, or depletion?
clarified the wording in what are now lines 278-279 which was indeed confusing: we meant
alk about the full harvest of an individual school, without depleting the global stock (meaning
t exhausted schools are replaced quickly, representing the fact that agents are in fact
loiting a larger population with roughly fixed density).
ce individual schools can be exhausted, and are exhausted faster when more agents are
loiting the same school, even with no overall depletion there is in fact a penalty for sharing.
wever, this penalty decreases if schools are very mobile, so that an agent will be unable to
loit a school fully no matter whether it is shared or not.
A gentle suggestion here and elsewhere: rather than saying “even at <U+03BB> = 1”, why not refer to
mplete information sharing”, then the reader does not have to keep remembering what the
ameter means.
agree this is clearer and have updated the text.
“TACs is better” should be “TACs are better” – Resolved.
ure 3: how can target species mobility be negative? They can’t be more than stationary (0). –
we now clarify, this axis and others are in log-scale, because target species mobility is
ned as a ratio between simulation parameters. We have updated this figure for clarity.
