The manuscript presents a combined experimental and computational study aimed at direct
calibration of a finite element model of the bovine caudal intervertebral disc. It appears to be the
first to address the issue of residual circumferential strains in the AF in the context of modeling
the mechanical behavior of the whole disc.
Specific Comments:
What was the length of the circumferential incision made between the inner AF and NP? What
was the rationale for not incising around the whole circumference?
The authors report a small deviation from perfect circle, which agrees with previous aspect ratio
measurements by O’Connell (Spine, 2007) and Michalek (The Spine Journal, 2012). It is not stated
in the methods or results if this measurement was made before or after radial incision. Figure 1
appears to show a radius of curvature which increases near the incision site.
The calculation of hoop strain from opening angle is said to assume homogeneity throughout the
radial thickness. This is not possible, as homogenous radial tension or compression would violate
static equilibrium. Previous calculations of residual strains in annular structures, such as by
Chuong (J Biomech Eng, 1986) and Michalek (J Biomech, 2012) have typically assumed a
cylindrical intact shape arising from closure of a curved plate, which results in a gradient from
circumferential compression on the inner wall to circumferential tension on the outer wall. More
recent measurements by Duclos (J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 2017) did not make this
assumption and confirmed tension on the outer wall, compression mid-wall, and both tension
and compression on the inner wall.
The opening shown in Figure 1 appears to be comparable that shown in Michalek (J Biomech,
2012) for a disc with radial incision prior to NP removal. The results of this manuscript present
calculated hoop strain, but not measured opening displacement or angle. Comparing raw
opening displacement measurements to those previously reported may be a more appropriate
way to test the effect of freezing than comparing strains. Particularly since different assumptions
appear to have been made in the strain calculations.

The manuscript has been significantly improved since the initial submission. A few minor
clarifications remain to be made.
1) The fact that the cut surfaces remained radial and straight (P10,L14) does not necessarily
suggest homogeneous hoop strain across the thickness. The calculation of hoop strain presented
by Chuong and Fung resulted in a trend from inner compression to outer tension even with an
assumption of radial lines remaining radial.
2) While the difference in opening angles between the current experiments and Michalek, 2012
may be the result of freezing, constraint by the NP likely plays a role as well. In the previous
experiments, opening angle (as defined in Figure 1 of the present manuscript, though the term
has a few different definitions across the literature) ranged from 20deg with the NP fully attached
to 108deg with the NP fully removed. Measuring 50deg with the NP approximately one fourth
detached is neither surprising nor readily predictable. Testing the specimen freezing effect under
better matched conditions may be an interesting future study.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript presents a combined experimental and computational study aimed at direct
calibration of a finite element model of the bovine caudal intervertebral disc. It appears to be the first
to address the issue of residual circumferential strains in the AF in the context of modeling the
mechanical behavior of the whole disc.
Specific Comments:
1. What was the length of the circumferential incision made between the inner AF and NP? What
was the rationale for not incising around the whole circumference?
This information is indeed missing from the methods. The cut length covered an arc of about 90°. The
main reason not to incise the whole circumference was to minimise the manipulation of the fresh
tissue. Dissection of the tissue in this area is relatively tricky with a scalpel blade and dissecting over
the whole circumference would have required tissue manipulation beyond our confidence that we
were not damaging the AF tissue or dehydrating it.
We addressed this comment both in the methods (page 4) and the discussion (page 9).
2. The authors report a small deviation from perfect circle, which agrees with previous aspect
ratio measurements by O’Connell (Spine, 2007) and Michalek (The Spine Journal, 2012). It is
not stated in the methods or results if this measurement was made before or after radial
incision. Figure 1 appears to show a radius of curvature which increases near the incision site.
Once again the information is indeed missing from the methods description, for which we apologise.
The initially reported measurement was done before any incision.
To address this comment, we report in the reviewed version of the paper the measurements both
before and after incision (at time t=0 and t=10 minutes). The diameter measurement at 10 minutes
relaxation was made so that 2 of the diameters correspond to the edges of the opened cut. This
showed no significant difference in deviation from circularity (paired t-test p-value of 0.136).
Moreover, the diameters measured on the edges of the cut were not significantly different from other
measurements (paired t-test p-value of 0.07289), corresponding to no significant difference in the
radius of curvature. Finally the diameters of the intact state were not significant different from those
in the relaxed states (paired t-test p-value of 0.2543)
This information, present in the data accessible with the paper, has been added to the methods (page
5 and 8), the results (page 8), and the discussion (page 9-10).
3. The calculation of hoop strain from opening angle is said to assume homogeneity throughout
the radial thickness. This is not possible, as homogenous radial tension or compression would
violate static equilibrium. Previous calculations of residual strains in annular structures, such
as by Chuong (J Biomech Eng, 1986) and Michalek (J Biomech, 2012) have typically assumed a
cylindrical intact shape arising from closure of a curved plate, which results in a gradient from
circumferential compression on the inner wall to circumferential tension on the outer wall.
More recent measurements by Duclos (J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 2017) did not make this
assumption and confirmed tension on the outer wall, compression mid-wall, and both tension
and compression on the inner wall.
The phrasing we used of “assuming homogeneous strains” would indeed be incorrect as you pointed
out this is not thermodynamically consistent if the tissue was a homogeneous material. However, we
observed circumferential openings that maintained straight edges without significant change in radius
of curvature. This therefore allowed us to use the simplified definition of hoop strains, similar to your
definition of circumferential residual stretch with r=R (equation 1 in your J Biomech 2012 paper or 5
in Chuong’s one), except for the consideration of which state is the initial state and which is the final.
It is possible that if we had left our samples for a longer relaxation time or completely removed the
nucleus this would have changed. Indeed while the difference in opening angles between t=10
minutes and t=25 minutes was not statistically significant over the 5 samples, 3 of them showed clear
increase in opening that may have continued longer term. Similarly, measuring the annulus radial
thickness around the cut would have likely given a more accurate representation of the change of
radius (rather than measuring diameters).
The measurements taken are only exact for the outer AF. The relative homogeneity is more an
observation without exact measurement given the difficulty to differentiate AF from NP in
photographs.
We have rephrased the method (page 5) and the discussion (page 9) and added a note on the end of
the corresponding discussion paragraph (page 10).
4. The opening shown in Figure 1 appears to be comparable that shown in Michalek (J Biomech,
2012) for a disc with radial incision prior to NP removal. The results of this manuscript present
calculated hoop strain, but not measured opening displacement or angle. Comparing raw
opening displacement measurements to those previously reported may be a more
appropriate way to test the effect of freezing than comparing strains. Particularly since
different assumptions appear to have been made in the strain calculations.
Your work in J Biomech 2012 is indeed a good basis for comparison, and comparing opening angles
are indeed more appropriate. This paper reports initial openings of 4.3±1.8 mm which, using the
dimension measurements in our study corresponds to an angle of about 20°. The opening angles we
observed at 10 minutes were 49.6°±9.2°. This suggest that relaxation of the tissue at short time scales
is affected by the freezing steps in your work if the recording time is similar.
A discussion around this has been added page 10.

Reviewer: 2
This is a very interesting work that describes a method to characterize the annulus fibrosus. Numerical
and experimental investigations have been combined to find the mechanical parameters that describe
the annulus behavior. However, I think that the authors should better justify some assumptions to
make the work suitable for publishing.
1. In particular, I have doubts about the characterization of the extrafibrillar matrix. How can the
authors say that the measured hoop strains are not affected by the collagen fibers? The
annulus fibrosus is an anisotropic structure composed by lamellae, and I cannot understand
how thay not influence its “opening”. A very similar procedure has been applied to the ovine
disc (Casaroli et al, A novel finite element model of the ovine lumbar intervertebral disc with
anisotropic hyperelastic material properties, PLOS One, 2017), but in that study the
extrafibrillar matrix was tested in compression, so the fibers did not generated any resistance
in the tissue. How do the authors support their choice? A comparison with Casaroli et al should
be interesting.
We believe the reviewer has misunderstood the two separate tests undertaken in this paper. We
certainly agree that the measured hoop strains are representative of circumferential strains of the
whole tissue, extrafibrillar matrix and fibres; and these tests were not used to characterise the
extrafibrillar matrix.
Instead, the extrafibrillar matrix was tested in a separate set of test on individual lamellae which were
loaded perpendicular to the fibre direction, so that they do not generate resistance, except for
Poisson’s effect – similar to testing under compression as the reviewer cites. The extrafibrillar matrix
data is thus representative of the tensile behaviour of the matrix embedded with fibres.
The hoop strain is the strain perceived by all components of the tissue in the circumferential direction.
We are not intending to suggest that the fibres do not experience circumferential strains or that they
do not affect the circumferential strains but that the measured strain is the matrix strain in the
circumferential direction as well as the fibres strain in the circumferential direction.
A comparison with Casaroli et al was not performed at submission as this was a transfer from a R Soc
Interface submission (27/04) prior to Casaroli’s paper online availability (04/05). Comparison,
however, is tricky as it is a different species and experimental data in Monaco et al (J Morphology
2016) showed clear differences in the extrafibrillar matrix stiffness between bovine and porcine/ovine
tissue, with the bovine tissue twice and four times stiffer respectively. With that ratio in mind, and
with matrix moduli reported between 0.26 and 0.46 MPa in Casaroli et al for ovine tissue while 1.5
MPa for the bovine tissue here, we observe similar ratio (with in fact the highest modulus reported by
Casaroli corresponding to the mean ovine modulus in Monaco et al). Given the difference in species
and the fact that experimental characterisation of the extra-fibrillar matrix was not performed in this
study but only the data used, discussing Casaroli’s paper for this part of the work is not really
appropriate. However, we added some discussion comparing the methods to extract the fibrillar
behaviour (page 13).

2. Which values for C10 and D in the HGO formulation did the authors find for the specimens?
Which value for the fibers dispersion?
Values were indeed not directly stated – this has been modified in the methods (page 6).

3. How long did you apply the pre-load of 10 N? Why 10 N?
What we meant is that a 10 N load is applied to ensure contact, corresponding to a state from which
the displacement are computed. The load is not maintained at 10N for more than a fraction of a
second. The 10N value corresponds to the weight of the compression plate. The phrasing has been
modified in the methods (page 6).
4. In the FE model, the Young modulus of the bone ranged between 10 and 910 MPa. Why did
the authors did not consider the cortical bone?
Values of the Young’s modulus for bone correspond to equivalent greyscale values in the image. Those
account for both cortical and trabecular tissue. Cortical shell on bovine caudal vertebrae is very thin
(at most 1.5 mm furthest away from the disc in our samples). This means that once downsampled to
0.5 mm most voxel with cortical bone also contains background information or trabecular tissue –
hence a relatively low equivalent Young’s modulus. The method used to calibrate the relation between
greyscale values and Young’s modulus is introduced in Wijayathunga et al 2008 [21]. Its application to
other bone tissue than the one reported in that paper, including bovine tails, is soon to appear in
Annals of Biomedical Engineering (minor comments at second review).

5. Sensitivity analysis: did the authors apply the same loading conditions of the experimental
test?
Yes, the exact same method is applied except for what is stated as being changed. This has been
clarified in the methods page 7
6. Is a compressive test adapted to validate the annulus fibrosus? Did the authors perform some
simulations to measure the flexibility of the disc?
We agree with the reviewer that axial compression may not be the best way to calibrate a complete
model of the annulus fibrosus as it is the loading scenario for which the fibres are likely to be the less
stretched and for which the full non-linearity is not apparent. However, compression is physiologically
relevant. This was previously mentioned on page 13 and this discussion has now been extended.
7. Figures 4 and 5 are not very easy to read.
Sorry about this – this is due to the pdf conversion. The figure has been slightly amended to ensure
the conversion is of better quality

1) The fact that the cut surfaces remained radial and straight (P10,L14) does not necessarily suggest
homogeneous hoop strain across the thickness. The calculation of hoop strain presented by Chuong
and Fung resulted in a trend from inner compression to outer tension even with an assumption of
radial lines remaining radial.
The combination of radial and straight cut surfaces without a change of diameter allows to assume
that r \approx R and therefore in this specific case can simplify to the definition used here.
We have rephrased the method as below in red:
Nucleus-to-annulus diameter ratio were extracted and hoop strain, i.e. the strain needed for the
opened annulus to be closed, was derived as the outer annulus hoop strain <U+0001D700>h = <U+0001D711>/(2<U+0001D70B> - <U+0001D711>),
assuming circularity of the disc and disc diameter maintained with tissue relaxation.
Associated comment and response in previous review:
The calculation of hoop strain from opening angle is said to assume homogeneity throughout the
radial thickness. This is not possible, as homogenous radial tension or compression would violate static
equilibrium. Previous calculations of residual strains in annular structures, such as by Chuong (J
Biomech Eng, 1986) and Michalek (J Biomech, 2012) have typically assumed a cylindrical intact shape
arising from closure of a curved plate, which results in a gradient from circumferential compression
on the inner wall to circumferential tension on the outer wall. More recent measurements by Duclos
(J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 2017) did not make this assumption and confirmed tension on the outer
wall, compression mid-wall, and both tension and compression on the inner wall.
The phrasing we used of “assuming homogeneous strains” would indeed be incorrect as you
pointed out this is not thermodynamically consistent if the tissue was a homogeneous material.
However, we observed circumferential openings that maintained straight edges without
significant change in radius of curvature. This therefore allowed us to use the simplified definition
of hoop strains, similar to your definition of circumferential residual stretch with r=R (equation 1
in your J Biomech 2012 paper or 5 in Chuong’s one), except for the consideration of which state
is the initial state and which is the final. It is possible that if we had left our samples for a longer
relaxation time or completely removed the nucleus this would have changed. Indeed while the
difference in opening angles between t=10 minutes and t=25 minutes was not statistically
significant over the 5 samples, 3 of them showed clear increase in opening that may have
continued longer term. Similarly, measuring the annulus radial thickness around the cut would
have likely given a more accurate representation of the change of radius (rather than measuring
diameters).
The measurements taken are only exact for the outer AF. The relative homogeneity is more an
observation without exact measurement given the difficulty to differentiate AF from NP in
photographs.
We have rephrased the method (page 5) and the discussion (page 9) and added a note on the
end of the corresponding discussion paragraph (page 10).
2) While the difference in opening angles between the current experiments and Michalek, 2012 may
be the result of freezing, constraint by the NP likely plays a role as well. In the previous experiments,
opening angle (as defined in Figure 1 of the present manuscript, though the term has a few different
definitions across the literature) ranged from 20deg with the NP fully attached to 108deg with the NP
fully removed. Measuring 50deg with the NP approximately one fourth detached is neither surprising
nor readily predictable. Testing the specimen freezing effect under better matched conditions may be
an interesting future study.
We have slightly amended the discussion as below in red:
Michalek et al [15] reported initial openings with the nucleus fully attached to the annulus of 4.3±1.8
mm, which when associated with the diameter measured in this work, corresponds to opening angles
of about 20°, while the opening angles observed at 10 minutes relaxation in this work were 49.6°±9.2°
with the annulus partially detached from the nucleus. The difference may come from a difference in
relaxation time, from the difference between frozen and fresh tissue [30] and likely from interaction
with the nucleus where it is not cut from the annulus
Associated comment and response in previous review:
The opening shown in Figure 1 appears to be comparable that shown in Michalek (J Biomech, 2012)
for a disc with radial incision prior to NP removal. The results of this manuscript present calculated
hoop strain, but not measured opening displacement or angle. Comparing raw opening displacement
measurements to those previously reported may be a more appropriate way to test the effect of
freezing than comparing strains. Particularly since different assumptions appear to have been made
in the strain calculations
The phrasing we used of “assuming homogeneous strains” would indeed be incorrect as you
pointed out this is not thermodynamically consistent if the tissue was a homogeneous material.
Your work in J Biomech 2012 is indeed a good basis for comparison, and comparing opening
angles are indeed more appropriate. This paper reports initial openings of 4.3±1.8 mm which,
using the dimension measurements in our study corresponds to an angle of about 20°. The
opening angles we observed at 10 minutes were 49.6°±9.2°. This suggest that relaxation of the
tissue at short time scales is affected by the freezing steps in your work if the recording time is
similar.
A discussion around this has been added page 10.
