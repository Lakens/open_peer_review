I refer to the two "sides" in this debate as "Toudic" and "Couzi". References are the numbers used
in this submitted comment; I'll call this reference [0].
This paper is a response to a comment by Toudic et al [2] on work that Couzi et al published in
label_version_2
RSOS in 2018 [1]. I have seen the comment by Toudic [2], so review accordingly.
It seems that a significant disagreement has arisen between Toudic and Couzi concerning the
complex incommensurate phase transitions in a family of urea inclusion compounds. I have
done my best to understand the situation based on the various publications in question. It is,
however, hard to reach a definitive conclusion as the arguments involved are complex both
scientifically and non-scientifically. My conclusions are based on my best understanding of the
situation, and I apologise if I have reached incorrect conclusions.
The crux of the scientific argument seems to be whether there is a single transition from phase I to
phase II in these materials or a second lower-temperature transition to phase III. This has,
however, spilled over into a debate about whether the scientific literature is being appropriately
interpreted and cited.
The scientific facts rest on the extinction patterns seen in phase II. In a 2016 EPL article [4] Couzi
et al stated that only phase II was real. This was challenged by Toudic [5] who stated that the
temperature used in [4] meant that Couzi were actually studying phase III. This comment was
not challenged by Couzi.
In the paper currently under question [1] (published after [5]) Couzi et al. make some strong
statements which, to my reading, don’t take the content of [5] appropriately into account. In
particular they say (P4) “[our EPL] recent paper…demonstrated conclusively that the symmetries
of both phase II and “III” can be described by (3+1)-dimensional superspace groups” (and similar
on P5). In my view it is remiss that they did not explicitly refer to the controversy over this point
that was discussed in [5]. The fact that Couzi was fully aware of the controversy is supported by
paragraph 4 of this comment [0] which says that the only way to resolve things was to collect
more data. There are also other phrases (e.g. “…admitting explicitly….” P5) in [1] which seem
overly-strongly worded based on what I understand of the literature.
In this response [0] Couzi is now essentially saying that he has definitive proof for the crucial h+k
reflections being present in phase II. If true this would clear up the scientific controversy.
Unfortunately this is just "to be published [6]" and there is no evidence presented with this
4
comment to support the statement. As such this comment doesn't follow the usual process of
scientific peer review. The reviewer and reader are being asked to accept a statement in a
controversial area without being given the normal opportunity to review the experimental data.
This seems to go against the "Open" ethos or RSOS. I imagine Toudic will feel the same way.
My impression is that publication of these back-to back comments as written will lead to future
arguments and both professional and personal upset for all involved. It will also create a
confused literature for those that follow. These are things things RSOS should try and avoid.
The best route forward is obviously something that the editorial team must make the final
decision on, as there as many policy as science issues in play. However, my recommendation is
that this response should only be published if it is toned down and Couzi is more conciliatory in
the language used. I suggest Couzi acknowledges that their statements in [1] were too strong in
places based on the data then publically available. Any additional statements they want to
include in this comment about subsequent work have to be supported with experimental data
that others can judge (e.g. as SI or via link to a preprint of any future publication such as [6]).

I have read the modified comment and the responses of the authors. The authors have provided
new experimental data for one of the compounds under debate as requested by the referees, and
the data show that their Phase II has the same extinction conditions as reported for Phase III by
Toudic et al. As such the new data presented addresses the core question posed in the Toudic
comment [2]. The authors have included an acknowledgement that some of the statements in [1]
weren't proven at the time of writing which seems appropriate.
My recommendation is to publish this response but I have the following suggestion:
P3 L4-6: I don't think that the sentence "Toudic et al do not contest our assertion that the
10
diffraction data for both phase II and phase "III" can be indexed … (3+1) dimensional superspace"
should be included in this Reply. It addresses an issue that wasn't raised in the RSOS comment.
The issue was, however, discussed extensively in the earlier EPL comment by Toudic [7] to which
Couzi didn't respond. The debate here also concerns the n-hexadecane compound, and no new
data is presented on this. P6 L37 should be updated at the same time. Any further discussion on
this point should be via regular peer-reviewed publication.
P3 L37: I would suggest "vindicated" is changed to "supported". Vindicated, at least in its
etymology, can be interpreted as a somewhat aggressive term. As such it doesn't mirror the
acknowledgement in the preceding section that statements were made without scientific
evidence.

per is a response to a comment by Toudic et al [2] on work that Couzi et al published in RSOS in
1]. I have seen the comment by Toudic [2], so review accordingly.
s that a significant disagreement has arisen between Toudic and Couzi concerning the complex
mensurate phase transitions in a family of urea inclusion compounds. I have done my best to
tand the situation based on the various publications in question. It is, however, hard to reach a
ve conclusion as the arguments involved are complex both scientifically and non-scientifically.
clusions are based on my best understanding of the situation, and I apologise if I have reached
ct conclusions.
x of the scientific argument seems to be whether there is a single transition from phase I to
I in these materials or a second lower-temperature transition to phase III. This has, however,
over into a debate about whether the scientific literature is being appropriately interpreted
ed.
entific facts rest on the extinction patterns seen in phase II. In a 2016 EPL article [4] Couzi et al
that only phase II was real. This was challenged by Toudic [5] who stated that the temperature
[4] meant that Couzi were actually studying phase III. This comment was not challenged by
ee completely with the reviewer that "the scientific facts rest on the extinction patterns seen in
I". In this regard, the new data presented in our revised Reply verify that "main reflections" (h,
with h+k odd are clearly observed in phase II.
revised Reply, we have also added a discussion (see the paragraph beginning "The phase
on temperatures ..." on page 2 of the revised Reply) relating to the selection of 147 K as the
rature for our earlier X-ray diffraction study (i.e. ref. [4] of our revised Reply), and accepting
ere is "uncertainty whether the sample was actually in phase II or phase "III" during the
rement at 147 K". We believe that Toudic is not correct (as quoted by the reviewer) to state
he temperature used in [4] meant that Couzi were actually studying phase III", but rather that
ld not be certain whether the sample was actually in phase II or in phase III at this
rature.
t that we did not "challenge" the earlier Comment of Toudic (i.e. ref. [7] of our revised Reply)
ot mean that we agreed with the earlier Comment of Toudic, but instead (as stated in our
"we felt that the most satisfactory approach to address the issue would be to undertake a new
ore comprehensive synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction study". In hindsight, we should
ly have proceeded to publish a Reply to the earlier Comment of Toudic (as the absence of a
might have given the false impression that we agreed with their Comment). Nevertheless, we
imistic that the new data presented here will resolve the controversy.
er, as noted in the final sentence of our revised Reply, "an important question is now to
tand the reasons underlying the differences between the experimental diffraction data, and the
onding structural conclusions, for n-nonadecane/urea reported in the work of Toudic et al. and
own work". We are fully confident in the reliability of the new data and conclusions presented
Reply, and we hope that progress will be made in the future to understand why the data
ed previously by Toudic et al for phase II of n-nonadecane/urea do not agree with our results.
paper currently under question [1] (published after [5]) Couzi et al. make some strong
ents which, to my reading, dont take the content of [5] appropriately into account. In
lar they say (P4) [our EPL] recent paper demonstrated conclusively that the symmetries of both
I and can be described by (3+1)-dimensional superspace groups (and similar on P5). In my
is remiss that they did not explicitly refer to the controversy over this point that was discussed
The fact that Couzi was fully aware of the controversy is supported by paragraph 4 of this
ent [0] which says that the only way to resolve things was to collect more data. There are also
hrases (e.g. admitting explicitly P5) in [1] which seem overly-strongly worded based on what I
tand of the literature.
evious statement (in ref. [1] of our revised Reply) that our EPL paper (ref. [4] of our revised
"demonstrated conclusively that the symmetries of both phase II and can be described by
imensional superspace groups" is based on our proof that the two misfit parameters proposed
usly by Toudic are actually related by a simple relationship, such that all diffraction maxima can
xed on the basis of a single misfit parameter and hence indexed on the basis of a minimal
imensional superspace. This point was discussed in detail in our EPL paper, and this aspect of
L paper still holds firmly. The "controversy" only concerns whether the 147 K data reported in
L paper actually represented phase II or phase "III", with implications for the assignment of the
pace group for phase II.
antly, the recent Comment of Toudic (ref. [2] of our revised Reply) makes no criticism of our
on that the minimal (3+1)-dimensional superspace descriptions are appropriate for this system.
, their criticism is focused solely on the uncertainty of whether the data at 147 K reported in
L paper represented phase II or phase "III". The new data presented in our revised Reply
s this "controversy", as the data recorded at temperatures that are indisputably in phase II
hat "main reflections" (h, k, l, 0) with h+k odd are indeed present in phase II.
response [0] Couzi is now essentially saying that he has definitive proof for the crucial h+k
ons being present in phase II. If true this would clear up the scientific controversy.
unately this is just "to be published [6]" and there is no evidence presented with this comment
port the statement. As such this comment doesn't follow the usual process of scientific peer
. The reviewer and reader are being asked to accept a statement in a controversial area
t being given the normal opportunity to review the experimental data. This seems to go
the "Open" ethos or RSOS. I imagine Toudic will feel the same way.
ally understand the need to provide our new data to allow the reviewers to assess the
ce, and the revised version of our Reply has been substantially extended to include results from
w experiments. We apologize for not including this information at the time of submitting our
l Reply.
glad that the reviewer agrees that the scientific controversy would be cleared up by providing
ve proof of the "crucial reflections" in phase II. In this regard, we emphasize (i) that the new
the revised Reply were recorded at small temperature increments on crossing the phase
on from phase I to phase II such that we can be certain that our measured data do indeed
ent phase II, and (ii) that the new data for phase II show clear evidence that "main reflections"
0) with h+k odd are present in phase II. Both of these points are elaborated in detail in the
Reply.
we note that the data at 161 K are still the hexagonal high-temperature phase I, while the first
ce of the transition to the orthorhombic phase II is observed at 159 K, and the data at 157 K
5 K indisputably represent phase II. As the temperature interval of phase II is 11.8 K (i.e. phase
s in a temperature interval of 11.8 K below the phase transition from phase I to phase II), our
rements at 157 K and 155 K are indisputably in phase II.
ly, Figures 3, 4 and 5 of the revised Reply show clearly the presence of reflections of the type
0) with h+k odd in phase II. For example, the reflections (3, –2, 1, 0), (3, –2, 0, 0) and (3, –2, –1,
explicitly highlighted in Figure 5.
st route forward is obviously something that the editorial team must make the final decision
there as many policy as science issues in play. However, my recommendation is that this
se should only be published if it is toned down and Couzi is more conciliatory in the language
suggest Couzi acknowledges that their statements in [1] were too strong in places based on
a then publically available.
ee with the referee on this point, and we have looked carefully at how the statements in our
aper (ref. [1] of our revised Reply) may have been based too strongly on those conclusions in
vious EPL paper (ref. [4] of our revised Reply) that relied upon the data recorded at 147 K in
per. For this reason, we feel that the statement in our RSOS paper "it has been shown that
hases II and "III" belong to the same superspace group P212121(00<U+03B3>)" was too strongly worded,
have added the following statement to our revised Reply in order to address this issue:
... given the uncertainty of whether the measurement of data at 147 K in our
earlier paper [4] actually represented phase II or phase "III", we accept that our
previous statement [1] that "it has been shown that both phases II and "III"
belong to the same superspace group P212121(00<U+03B3>)" (with ref. [4] cited as
evidence in support of this statement) was misleading, as it was not supported
by the published evidence at that time. Nevertheless, we emphasize that any
model is based on certain underlying assumptions, and one assumption in the
case of our phenomenological model developed in ref. [1] was that phase II and
phase "III" have the same superspace group P212121(00<U+03B3>). Clearly this
assumption, while not proven by published work at the time of publication of ref.
[1], is now vindicated by the new data presented here.
er, all other statements in our RSOS paper (ref. [1] of our revised Reply) that refer to our
us EPL paper (ref. [4] of our revised Reply) are unaffected by the uncertainty over whether the
147 K represented phase II or phase "III", as these other statements refer to the conclusion
diffraction maxima for phase II and phase "III" can be indexed on the basis of a single misfit
eter and hence indexed on the basis of a minimal (3+1)-dimensional superspace. This
sion from our EPL paper still holds. Indeed, in their recent Comment [2], Toudic et al. do not
t the fact that the diffraction data for both phase II and phase "III" can be indexed on the basis
nimal (3+1)-dimensional superspace.
ditional statements they want to include in this comment about subsequent work have to be
ted with experimental data that others can judge (e.g. as SI or via link to a preprint of any
publication such as [6]).
ed above, the revised version of our Reply has been substantially extended to include the main
from our new experiments. The observation of the crucial reflections of the type (h, k, l, 0)
+k odd in phase II fully support the assignment of the four-dimensional superspace group
1(00<U+03B3>) to phase II. As our phenomenological model (i.e. our paper published in RSOS; ref. [1] of
ised Reply) for rationalization of the phase transitions in this incommensurate material is
on phase II and phase "III" having the same four-dimensional superspace group P212121(00<U+03B3>), it
that the results from our new X-ray diffraction study are in full support of our
menological model, and we hope that this point has been fully clarified in our revised Reply.

ny thanks for your e-mail received on 24 June informing us that our article (RSOS-190518.R1)
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in
ordance with the referee suggestions.
iewer 1 and Reviewer 2 do not request any further revisions, while Reviewer 3 recommends
changes. Accordingly, we have revised the manuscript to follow the requests of Reviewer 3 as
ailed below. Again, we are grateful to Reviewer 3 for their constructive and helpful suggestions.
changes that have been made are highlighted in green in the revised manuscript.
mment of Reviewer 3:
L4-6: I don't think that the sentence "Toudic et al do not contest our assertion that the
raction data for both phase II and phase "III" can be indexed … (3+1) dimensional superspace"
uld be included in this Reply. It addresses an issue that wasn't raised in the RSOS comment.
issue was, however, discussed extensively in the earlier EPL comment by Toudic [7] to which
zi didn't respond. The debate here also concerns the n-hexadecane compound, and no new
a is presented on this. P6 L37 should be updated at the same time. Any further discussion on
point should be via regular peer-reviewed publication.
r Response:
have deleted the following sentence, as recommended by the reviewer:
e note that, in their Comment [2], Toudic et al. do not contest our assertion that the diffraction
a for both phase II and phase "III" can be indexed on the basis of a single incommensurate
fit parameter, and hence can be indexed on the basis of a minimal (3+1)-dimensional
erspace."
h regard to the final sentence of the reviewer, we agree that further discussion of the point
ed should be made through future peer-reviewed publication, and we will do so in due course.
mment of Reviewer 3:
L37: I would suggest "vindicated" is changed to "supported". Vindicated, at least in its
mology, can be interpreted as a somewhat aggressive term. As such it doesn't mirror the
nowledgement in the preceding section that statements were made without scientific
dence.
r Response:
have changed the word "vindicated" to "supported", as suggested by the reviewer.
ditional Minor Revisions
ddition to the minor revisions in response to Reviewer 3 described above, we have made two
itional minor revisions as follows:
Although the authors for correspondence were indicated in the footnote on page 1 of the
nuscript, the asterisks used to indicate the correspondence authors were not actually included
he author list. These asterisks have now been added.
We felt it would be appropriate to add the following sentence on page 2, in order to provide a
between the earlier part of the paper in which we discuss the background and content of the
mment of Toudic et al., and the subsequent part of the paper in which we address the issues
ed in their Comment:
this Reply, we respond to the issues raised in the Comment of Toudic et al. [2]."
ase do not hesitate to contact me if you require any additional information.
rs sincerely,
