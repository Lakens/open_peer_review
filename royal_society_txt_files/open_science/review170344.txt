This manuscript presents a pair of related models, one deterministic and one agent-based, in an
attempt to explore the interaction between task persistence and task allocation. Specifically, the
authors examined whether and how the interaction between the proportion of honeybee “scouts”
and “recruits” with how often honeybees return to a food source affects food intake. They
conclude that both factors do indeed interact. Specifically, the more persistent recruits are, the
fewer scouts a colony should have. However, the more persistent scouts are, the more scouts a
colony should. I must point out that I am not qualified to review the deterministic model.
The question posed is a valid one, and one worth exploring. However, I am afraid I found the
manuscript lacking in several respects.
Firstly, the manuscript is somewhat poorly written: it is hard to follow and often convoluted,
with many sentences that must be read multiple times before they can be deciphered. I realise
that style is not a decision criterion for RSOS, but with a complex topic such as this one (with
many interactions and complicated models), clarity is key. Otherwise, the manuscript will only be
understood by other modellers. Indeed, I am afraid the entire manuscript felt like it was written
by a computer scientist rather than a biologist, which is also reflected in many departures from
biological realism in the model (see below). I advise the authors to give a version of the
manuscript to a MSc student studing biology, with little or no background in programming or
modelling – if they can understand what each sentence means, the manuscript is clear enough.
Secondly, and critically, there are large departures from biological realism. I realise that models
must, by definition, be simplifications. However, some decisions could radically alter the results
found and thus the conclusions drawn. The main culprit is that the “recruits” do not themselves
recruit. This does not reflect reality. By not having this effect, the positive feedback effect is
removed – an effect which is key to collective foraging in honeybees. Other examples of odd
design choices are 1) having a static environment - although this is discussed in the manuscript,
many other modelling efforts demonstrate that results from stable and static environments can be
wildly different. By not including environmental variation, the generalisability of this model is
severely curtailed. Similarly, only having one food quality available also misses out a key aspect
of environmental variability. Related to this, modelling foraging over only one day misses out
key aspects of the value of the waggle dance – namely to give foragers memories which they
exploit in the future (e.g. (Schürch and Grüter 2014) 2) Altering the velocity of foragers (why was
this done?) 3) the behavioural experiments were somewhat puzzling to me. Distances of 3, 5 or 10
meters from the nest are near meaningless for looking at foraging variation, as the are all
essentially right at the nest. Honeybees can forage up to 8 km from their nest. No information
about the time of year or location is given, but this is also critical for putting the data in context:
in spring, when nectar flow is high, the bees might have been unimpressed by the 1m feeder, and
not persisted very much. In late summer or autumn things would look very different. There are
many, many researchers studying honeybee foraging – surely high quality data could be obtained
at no effort from one such group. For example, persistence is explicitly studied over larger
distances by (Al Toufailia, Grüter, and Ratnieks 2013). Thus, I am afraid I have no confidence in
the parameterisation of the models. Honeybees have been known to make many tens of repeated
visits to a feeder, so it seems the cap of 22 visits is also not great (and should be at least tested for
an effect). The lack of biological realism is underlined by some odd results: in larger colonies, the
proportion of scouts needed should drop, not increase (as show in in S2b). This is due to the lack
of recruit recruitment. What is the real proportion of scouts in a colony? This should be
mentioned to put the model results in perspective. The result that the number of scouts drives the
number of recruits is because the recruitment is limited, since in the model recruits don't recruit.
We might see very different dynamics if this was corrected.
3
Thirdly, the agent based model was somewhat poorly described, and difficult to follow. The
diagrammatic representation in figure 1c helps a lot, but the text is very hard to follow. The
reference to the model did not work, and no model could be found on the authors GitHub site. I
would have preferred a standard ODD protocol (Grimm et al. 2010) instead of, or in addition to,
the current description. The role of the non-linear paths (fig 1a) are not made clear. For scouts, it
is clear that this is important during scouting. But when making return visits to the food source,
do bees switch feeders if they find another one? When bees reach the end of the modelled area,
do they fly back or are teleported?
Lastly, some key aspects of relevant literature are not mentioned. Most critically, the trade-off
between information gathering and exploitation is barely referred to, but this is a vibrant field
which is directly relevant here. Indeed the finding that a very high proportion of scouts is
required goes against what is normally found in most simulations and studies (i.e. that for most
of the time exploitation dominates exploration, apart from in extremely variable environments).
I am sorry that this review was so negative. I hope the effort I put into this review demonstrates
that it was performed in a spirit of constructive criticism. The manuscript did have some laudable
points. For example, it manages what most modelling studies fail, namely to produce testable
hypotheses (hypothesis generation) in lines 356-360. Indeed, I wish the authors would have
emphasised this more, instead of ending the manuscript with a plea that someone else should do
that.
I strongly encourage the authors to discuss their model carefully with researchers specialising in
empirical data collection on honey bee foraging – many of the assumptions the models make
might (or might not) be flawed, and this is something best judged by an experienced researcher. I
am afraid that this might result in very extensive changes to the model, and thus perhaps to the
results. As matters stand, I’m afraid the lack of biological realism makes any results drawn from
these models to be very limited in broader implications.
There are also several more minor points I would like to raise:
• “synergy” has a specific meaning – that one gets a stronger response from two effects
together than one would from adding both separate effects. I don’t think this is what the authors
show.
• Lines 23-4 – unclear
• Lines 37-8 – unclear
• Line 52 – “behavioral variation in foraging behaviors” – inelegant
• Line 127 – unclear – do the bees then fly exactly towards the report, or is there variation?
I suspect the latter, but the word “exactly” confuses matters.
• Line 151 – “foraging” did you mean scouting?
• Statistical analysis should not be carried out on model-derived data (White et al. 2014), as
the results are linked to sample size. Rather, use large numbers of models runs (500-1000) and
provide descriptive graphics.
• Lines 222-223 – using 16% probability on a (I assume) Gaussian distribution doesn’t seem
to describe the data shown in 2c well.
• Some reported results are so obvious as to not require mentioning, e.g. line 236, the
amount of food collected increases over time. As food cannot be lost, this is a given, surely? Also
line 265-6 and 368-9.
• Lines 389-393 – I find this reasoning unsatisfying – a bug fix would solve this problem;
and it may not even be a problem (Al Toufailia, Grüter, and Ratnieks 2013). Regardless, this
belongs in the methods.
• Line 400-403 – overlong sentence

First up apologies for the delay in my review, I am about to leave for the field and haven’t had
the opportunity to give this the attention it deserves.
That said, I can see that it is good work that is well thought out and conducted, and seems to
have been through review before as there are few errors that I can see. I like the paper, think it
makes a good contribution to our understanding of collective composition, and I would only
recommend minor changes before acceptance.
This is a modeling paper, but from the abstract this is not as clear as it could be. I would ask the
authors to make it clearer that the model is parameterised by empirical data, and are therefore
obviously relevant to biological systems, but the results are from the model rather than
measurements from actual hives.
Is there a typo in equation 8b? It seems Yr should actually be Ys…?

I have been asked to re-review this manuscript. In my previous review, I raised some concerns
about a variety of aspects of the manuscript, namely clarity (including the lack of an ODD
protocol), biological realism, a lack of sensitivity analysis, and some gaps in the literature
mentioned.
The authors have done a very good job addressing most of my comments. They have taken my
comments seriously and invested a lot of effort in handling them. I was impressed by the authors
9
willingness to perform many of the labour-intensive tasks I asked for, including an addition on a
recruit-recruitment sensitivity analysis and a complete ODD protocol. The manuscript also reads
much better, and is easier (though far from easy) to follow. The ODD protocol is particularly clear
and helpful. The authors also handled my comments about the empirical aspect of the
experiment well, giving details where needed, and convincing me that the data is appropriate for
use. All in all, a laudable improvement. By all rights, this revision should have completely
convinced me that the manuscript should be published.
However, I am afraid I still have concerns about the biological realism of the model. My concern
comes from a mismatch between the empirical data the authors collected on persistence (and
found in other studies), and the predicted optimal performance of the bees in the model. In figure
2c we see that the majority of bees make between 0 and 5 return visits – i.e. have a persistence of
between 0 and 5. Average persistence is probably 2.9, with on average 3.2 return trips. However,
as the authors state “the absolute amount of resources collected per colony continued to grow
when persistence increased beyond 20 visits per individual”, as can also be seen in figure 3e. If
the model reflects reality, bees would be under very strong selection to have very high
persistence. But bees show low persistence. This implies either that the model correctly reflects
the real world, but that the environment honey bees evolved under is radically different from
their current environment (which is somewhat unlikely), or that the model does not reflect reality
very well. In my previous review I suspected that this mismatch between the model results and
reality was due to a lack of recruitment by recruits in the model, but the authors convincingly
demonstrated that I was wrong. I now suspect that the lack of depletion in the model, or
generally the completely stable environment, is causing this mismatch between the model and
reality, but again I might be wrong. The authors argue that the modelled stable environment
“have biological significance for foraging in patchy resources that cannot be depleted in a single
day, such as blooming trees or meadows.” This may or may not be true – such resources may
change in productivity significantly throughout the day. I simply do not know. Or such resources
may not represent the most important nectar source for honeybees. Again, I do not know. It could
even be that it is the fact that all bees show the same persistence level in the model, while in
reality we have a large inter-individual variation (see also (Pamir et al., 2011)).
I am very positively inclined towards this work, as the authors have done such a good job
responding to my previous comments, so have tried hard to reconcile the predicted behaviour of
the bees from the model with the empirical data presented (and available from other sources).
Sadly, I have failed, and so cannot convince myself that this model is a good representation of
reality.
However, perhaps I am missing something. I don’t have access to Python and never learned to
use it, so couldn’t explore the model myself. It may have been a great help to have a stand-alone
applet one could explore. Or perhaps I have misunderstood the role of this model: perhaps the
model is not meant to represent reality, but explore a what-if scenario of best practice under ideal
conditions. The discussion raises interesting points, such as
“the ratio between scouts and recruits, and individual-level traits, such as the persistence of
foragers, interact to impact collective foraging”,
And that
“recruits may be the ones driving the adjustment of the colony’s exploration exploitation strategy
in response to both external and internal conditions”
It is just not clear to me that the specific conclusions drawn from the model can reliably represent
reality.
Again, I am really very sorry to raise these doubts and be so negative– especially at this late stage
in the review process. Given the conflict between the great job the authors have done with my
comments, and my continuing doubts about the validity of the manuscript, I would like to
abstain from making a recommendation about this manuscript. As I am not given this option, I
10
will be ticking the “reject” option, but strongly urge the editor to seek a second (third) opinion on
the matter.
Minor comments:
• The video associated with the model in the ODD protocol seems to show depletion of the
resources. This confused me a bit, as the resources in this paper are non-depleting (line 178).

between 0 and 5. Average persistence is probably 2.9, with on average 3.2 return trips. However,
as the authors state “the absolute amount of resources collected per colony continued to grow
when persistence increased beyond 20 visits per individual”, as can also be seen in figure 3e. If
the model reflects reality, bees would be under very strong selection to have very high
persistence. But bees show low persistence. This implies either that the model correctly reflects
the real world, but that the environment honey bees evolved under is radically different from
their current environment (which is somewhat unlikely), or that the model does not reflect reality
very well. In my previous review I suspected that this mismatch between the model results and
reality was due to a lack of recruitment by recruits in the model, but the authors convincingly
demonstrated that I was wrong. I now suspect that the lack of depletion in the model, or
generally the completely stable environment, is causing this mismatch between the model and
reality, but again I might be wrong. The authors argue that the modelled stable environment
“have biological significance for foraging in patchy resources that cannot be depleted in a single
day, such as blooming trees or meadows.” This may or may not be true – such resources may
change in productivity significantly throughout the day. I simply do not know. Or such resources
may not represent the most important nectar source for honeybees. Again, I do not know. It could
even be that it is the fact that all bees show the same persistence level in the model, while in
reality we have a large inter-individual variation (see also (Pamir et al., 2011)).
I am very positively inclined towards this work, as the authors have done such a good job
responding to my previous comments, so have tried hard to reconcile the predicted behaviour of
the bees from the model with the empirical data presented (and available from other sources).
Sadly, I have failed, and so cannot convince myself that this model is a good representation of
reality.
However, perhaps I am missing something. I don’t have access to Python and never learned to
use it, so couldn’t explore the model myself. It may have been a great help to have a stand-alone
applet one could explore. Or perhaps I have misunderstood the role of this model: perhaps the
model is not meant to represent reality, but explore a what-if scenario of best practice under ideal
conditions. The discussion raises interesting points, such as
12
“the ratio between scouts and recruits, and individual-level traits, such as the persistence of
foragers, interact to impact collective foraging”,
And that
“recruits may be the ones driving the adjustment of the colony’s exploration exploitation strategy
in response to both external and internal conditions”
It is just not clear to me that the specific conclusions drawn from the model can reliably represent
reality.
Again, I am really very sorry to raise these doubts and be so negative– especially at this late stage
in the review process. Given the conflict between the great job the authors have done with my
comments, and my continuing doubts about the validity of the manuscript, I would like to
abstain from making a recommendation about this manuscript. As I am not given this option, I
will be ticking the “reject” option, but strongly urge the editor to seek a second (third) opinion on
the matter.
Minor comments:
• The video associated with the model in the ODD protocol seems to show depletion of the
resources. This confused me a bit, as the resources in this paper are non-depleting (line 178).

The manuscript "Task allocation and site fidelity jointly influence foraging regulation in honey
bee colonies" explores the trade-offs between scouting and recruiting, exploration and
exploitation, and variation among individuals in their persistence to continue foraging at a
specific location. The introduction was complicated, though still contained enough information to
make clear why the study was being conducted. The model was complex, but all details on the
implementation and parameters are provided (either in text or in the supplement). One highlight
of this study was that researchers include behavioral experiments in order to estimate many of
their parameters for the model.
My only major comment is regarding the discussion. As mentioned, the methods were very
detailed and complex, and the results showed clear patterns as parameters varied. I would have
liked to have seen more of the discussion linked back to how these patterns mimic natural honey
bee patterns. e.g., 367-9: "the percentage of scouts in honeybee colonies is between 5% and 35%
[38]. These numbers are slightly lower than the optimal proportions we found here and this
difference can be explained by the parameter choice for the number of bees that respond to a
waggle dance (Figure S3)." If the numbers do not match what you observe in natural colonies,
what are the biological constraints keeping colonies from performing at the calculated optimal
range? Otherwise, are you saying that the parameter choice for bees responding to the dance are
biologically unrealistic? Lines 410-5: "It would be interesting to further investigate the effect of
14
increasing collection efficiency on collective dynamics in primitively social bees that exhibit
division of labor but spatial information is not shared during recruitment e. g., bumble bees [43],
or halictine bees in which there are no known mechanisms of recruitment [67]." This would be
interesting, however, a number of studies have investigated (empirically and through agent-
based simulations) how behavior would change if recruitment were removed from honey bees.
The point that I'm trying to suggest here is not to add in these specific refs, necessarily, but to
emphasize that there are opportunities throughout the discussion where putting these results in
context with what is known about the actual biology of these systems would really help clarify
the main goals with this model. Line 428-30: "Our model can thus be used to generate hypotheses
for further empirical work on the regulation of collective behavior and its response to various
environmental conditions." I absolutely agree with this statement, and think that it can be
strengthened with more evidence of how empirical work has benefited from the development of
models such as this in the past, and/or specifically what role this model will have on the field
going forward.
Minor Comments
Lines 52-3: "For example, the decision of a honey bee to leave the hive and start foraging is
influenced by the bee’s genotype." I was under the impression that it was influenced by hormonal
changes that might be triggered by changes in gene expression. Perhaps you meant 'genome'?
Lines 53-5: Genetic variation can influence the likelihood that a bee leaves a patch? Genetic
variation might explain why some individuals choose to stay longer in a patch (thresholds to
recognize a full crop might vary?), but the genetic variation is not the mechanism that affects the
bee's decision to leave. I think this just needs to be rephrased.
Line 122: At T-0, did all scouts leave the nest, or was there some randomness written into the
program as to when they left?
Line 125: Did scouts recruit every time they returned with food? Is this realistic?
Line 133: Was the recruitment behavior the same for all scouts (did it vary with food type or
distance or randomly?)
Figures S1-S3 are not mentioned in the text (at least before S4 is mentioned).
Lines 224-254: Behavioral assays were conducted on bees 3, 5, and 10 m from the hive to collect
parameter values. However, data are presented together. Why were data collected at three
different distances if data were to be pooled for analysis?
Line 280: 'discovering' should be 'discover'
Line 288: the way the model is designed, if a = 0, then no one ever leaves to initially forages, so no
food will be collected. But what if scouts do not recruit after every foraging bout?

Dear Dr. Andrew Dunn,
Thank you for the time and effort that you and the reviewers dedicated to our manuscript. We
appreciate the opportunity to re-submit a revised version of the manuscript. We have made
substantial revisions in accordance with the reviewers’ recommendations including:
1. We re-ran all our simulations with the additional condition that recruited bees can recruit
other foragers, based on the suggestion of reviewer #1. This new condition did not
qualitatively change our results. We now mention this condition in the text (see details
below) and add a new section about it in the supplementary material.
2. Created a new description of the model using the ODD protocol, as reviewer #1
requested.
3. Revised the text according to all of the suggestions provided by the reviewers as detailed
below.
Please find below a point-by-point response to the reviews indicating the nature and location of
changes using the line numbers from the revised manuscript. We believe the revised manuscript
is greatly improved and look forward to your decision.
Sincerely,
Thiago Mosqueiro, PhD
RESPONSE TO REVIEWER #1
This manuscript presents a pair of related models, one deterministic and one agent-based, in an attempt
to explore the interaction between task persistence and task allocation. Specifically, the authors examined
whether and how the interaction between the proportion of honeybee “scouts” and “recruits” with how
often honeybees return to a food source affects food intake. They conclude that both factors do indeed
interact. Specifically, the more persistent recruits are, the fewer scouts a colony should have. However,
the more persistent scouts are, the more scouts a colony should. I must point out that I am not qualified
to review the deterministic model.
The question posed is a valid one, and one worth exploring. However, I am afraid I found the manuscript
lacking in several respects.
>> We thank the reviewer for the valuable input. We followed carefully the reviewer’s comments and
provide a point-by-point response below.
Firstly, the manuscript is somewhat poorly written: it is hard to follow and often convoluted, with many
sentences that must be read multiple times before they can be deciphered. I realise that style is not a
decision criterion for RSOS, but with a complex topic such as this one (with many interactions and
complicated models), clarity is key. Otherwise, the manuscript will only be understood by other modellers.
Indeed, I am afraid the entire manuscript felt like it was written by a computer scientist rather than a
biologist, which is also reflected in many departures from biological realism in the model (see below). I
advise the authors to give a version of the manuscript to a MSc student studing biology, with little or no
background in programming or modelling – if they can understand what each sentence means, the
manuscript is clear enough.
>> We have revised the manuscript and rewrote sentences that were difficult to understand. We also
asked a biologist (with no computational background) to read our manuscript and used his feedback to
improve our writing.
Secondly, and critically, there are large departures from biological realism. I realise that models must, by
definition, be simplifications. However, some decisions could radically alter the results found and thus the
conclusions drawn. The main culprit is that the “recruits” do not themselves recruit. This does not reflect
reality. By not having this effect, the positive feedback effect is removed – an effect which is key to
collective foraging in honeybees.
>> We agree with the reviewer that models are simplifications of reality and therefore are limited and
subject to various assumptions. When we designed this model, we used a simplified recruitment process,
but following the reviewer’s suggestion we now expanded the model to include the recruitment by
recruits. This recruitment by recruits did not change the main results or conclusions of our study.
We provide a detailed explanation of the effect of recruitment by recruits in the supplementary material
and refer the reader to these results on line 137:
“For simplicity, only the recruitment by scouts is considered here, and we examine the effect of adding
recruitment by recruits in the Supplemental Material (Figures S4 and S5).”
And on line 371:
“Lastly, the effect of including recruitment by recruits on the optimal proportion of scouts was the same
as that of increasing the number of recruited foragers by scouts per waggle dance (Figures S4 and S5).”
Other examples of odd design choices are 1) having a static environment - although this is discussed in
the manuscript, many other modelling efforts demonstrate that results from stable and static
environments can be wildly different. By not including environmental variation, the generalisability of this
model is severely curtailed. Similarly, only having one food quality available also misses out a key aspect
of environmental variability.
>> We agree with the reviewer that a static environment is only one option out of an infinite amount of
possible environments. However, we believe that incorporating further complexity to the resources is
beyond the scope of this work. We point this out on line 410:
“The spatial and temporal abundance of resources can substantially impact foraging behavior
[26,57,66,68]. Indeed, during the development of our model we found that increasing the number of
resource patches caused the total amount of resources collected by the colony to increase for all
proportions of scouts, and the optimal proportion of scouts to decrease with the number of patches
(Figure S6). This finding is consistent with a model of collective foraging in ants [69] which also found that
the optimal proportion of scouts is inversely related to the amount of resources in the environment. To
examine the relationship between the proportion of scouts in a colony and behavioral persistence,
without the confounding effects of resource distribution, we focused only on one spatial setting in our
final model. The simulations we present have biological significance for foraging in patchy resources that
cannot be depleted in a single day, such as blooming trees or meadows.”
Related to this, modelling foraging over only one day misses out key aspects of the value of the waggle
dance – namely to give foragers memories which they exploit in the future (e.g. (Schürch and Grüter 2014)
>> As stated above, a model is limited in the number of parameters it can explore before it becomes too
unwieldly. We chose to examine a short time scale of one day so that we can make clear, simple, and
testable predictions. We now acknowledge that honeybees use the communicated information on both
long and short time scales and include a citation to Schürch and Grüter 2014 on line 67:
“Scouts communicate to recruits the direction, distance, and quality of newly found resources using the
waggle dance [32], thus reducing waste of energy spent when searching for food over both long and short
time scales [42,43], and dangers, such as predation [33,44,45]”
2) Altering the velocity of foragers (why was this done?)
>> We used two values of velocity for foragers to distinguish between scouts exploring the environment
and recruits exploiting the resources. Because recruited foragers know where to go, their flight is faster
and more precise than that of exploring scouts. Previous theoretical work also simulated different
velocities for scouts and recruits. <U+0001D463>" - the dispersion angle of the flight pattern determines both flight
precision and velocity. We now clarify these points on line 127:
“To differentiate between the flight patterns of bees that are exploring the environment and those that
are exploiting a resource patch, are familiar with its location, and are therefore faster and more precise,
we assigned <U+0001D463>" = 1 to scouts, and <U+0001D463>" = 1.5 to recruits, following [57].”
3) the behavioural experiments were somewhat puzzling to me. Distances of 3, 5 or 10 meters from the
nest are near meaningless for looking at foraging variation, as the are all essentially right at the nest.
Honeybees can forage up to 8 km from their nest. No information about the time of year or location is
given, but this is also critical for putting the data in context: in spring, when nectar flow is high, the bees
might have been unimpressed by the 1m feeder, and not persisted very much. In late summer or autumn
things would look very different. There are many, many researchers studying honeybee foraging – surely
high quality data could be obtained at no effort from one such group. For example, persistence is explicitly
studied over larger distances by (Al Toufailia, Grüter, and Ratnieks 2013). Thus, I am afraid I have no
confidence in the parameterisation of the models.
>> Our choice of feeder distance from the hive was based on previous work (Liang et al 2012). Al Toufailia
et al 2013 used 20m, and found smaller persistence values than us (3.7 compared to our 6.1±0.3), thus
bees in our experiment persisted even to close feeders, despite the reviewer’s assertion. Furthermore,
20m is on the same spatial scale as 10m and the results that Al Toufailia et al 2013 presented of bees
foraging at a distance of 400m (for instance, larger duration of trips and a smaller average persistence
than that of 20m) do not undermine our conclusions. We now add a reference to Al Toufailia et al 2013:
“We trained bees to find feeders, positioned at 3, 5 or 10m from the hive, one day before the experiments
began, following [18] and comparable to other studies that examine 20m [59].”
Furthermore, our experiments were performed during the winter when feeders that are close to the hive
are very attractive to foraging bees.
We now state the season on line 224:
“…during the winter (between February 3rd and 26th, 2016).”
We further clarify that during this time there were very few naturally blooming plants on line 228:
“During the time of our experiments there were few naturally blooming plants and our feeders were very
attractive to the bees.”
Honeybees have been known to make many tens of repeated visits to a feeder, so it seems the cap of 22
visits is also not great (and should be at least tested for an effect). The lack of biological realism is
underlined by some odd results: in larger colonies, the proportion of scouts needed should drop, not
increase (as show in in S2b). This is due to the lack of recruit recruitment.
>> The maximum number of observed trips in our experiments was 22. Our experiment lasted for about
one hour. In our simulations, we investigated larger values of persistence (most of our plots go up to 30).
However, both the proportion of scouts and the total amount of resources collected stabilized in a well-
defined plateau when persistence increased above 20~30 visits in our simulations. Thus, the amount of
food collected by additional trips, beyond the 20th trip, does not increase linearly.
We clarified this point in the text on line 244:
“Because the largest number of observed return visits by a single bee was 22, we restricted our
persistence parameter <U+0001D70B>" to range between 1 and 30.”
We further mention that larger values have little impact on our results in the caption of Figure 3:
“(d) Optimal proportion of scouts plateaus near 50% as <U+0001D70B> increases.”
What is the real proportion of scouts in a colony? This should be mentioned to put the model results in
perspective.
>> According to the literature, the percentage of scouts in a colony is between 5% and 35%. We added
this information to the text on line 362:
“Previous studies estimated that the percentage of scouts in honeybee colonies is between 5% and 35%
[38]. These numbers are slightly lower than the optimal proportions we found here and this difference
can be explained by the parameter choice for the number of bees that respond to a waggle dance (Figure
S3). Although colonies with higher recruitment rates required fewer scouts to achieve their optimal
foraging performance, the relationship between the optimal proportion of scouts and persistence did not
change (compare Figures 3 and 4 with Figure S3).”
The result that the number of scouts drives the number of recruits is because the recruitment is limited,
since in the model recruits don't recruit. We might see very different dynamics if this was corrected.
>> We now explain in the supplementary material the effect of recruitment by recruits on our results.
Thirdly, the agent based model was somewhat poorly described, and difficult to follow. The
diagrammatic representation in figure 1c helps a lot, but the text is very hard to follow. The reference to
the model did not work, and no model could be found on the authors GitHub site.
>> The source code is now available on GitHub https://github.com/VandroiyLabs/ABBAS and the
description of the model in the text was edited.
I would have preferred a standard ODD protocol (Grimm et al. 2010) instead of, or in addition to, the
current description.
>> We now provide a description of our model following the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details)
protocol in our GitHub repository. The ODD description is now permanently hosted in the following URL:
https://github.com/VandroiyLabs/ABBAS
We added this information in the text on lines 105:
“A description using Overview, Design concepts, and Details (ODD) protocol [51] and the source code of
our model can be found on Github [52].”
The role of the non-linear paths (fig 1a) are not made clear. For scouts, it is clear that this is important
during scouting.
>> The importance of using non-linear paths is to avoid an unrealistic scenario in which all simulated bees
fly along the exact same straight line. To make this point more evident, we added the following sentence
on line 117:
“The stochastic dynamics in Equation (1) produces slight variation among bees in their flight patterns to
avoid an unrealistic scenario in which bees take a straight line between two points.”
But when making return visits to the food source, do bees switch feeders if they find another one?
>> A bee exploits the first resource patch it finds, as observed in many experiments (included those
conducted by von Frisch). We now clarify this point on lines 142:
“Recruited bees exploited the first resource they found during their trips. The dispersion of recruited bees
(s=2) was fitted using data from experiments with feeders [32]. Because the stochastic element of the
flight of a recruited bee is very small compared to the size of the resource patches in our simulations, bees
always exploited the same resource patch that was reported to them.”
When bees reach the end of the modelled area, do they fly back or are teleported?
>> When bees reach the limits of the simulated area, they are instantly set back to the hive. This is a
commonly used boundary condition in agent-based simulations. We clarify this now on lines 130:
“Foragers that reached the limit of the simulated area were set back to the hive instantly to start foraging
again.”
Lastly, some key aspects of relevant literature are not mentioned. Most critically, the trade-off between
information gathering and exploitation is barely referred to, but this is a vibrant field which is directly
relevant here. Indeed the finding that a very high proportion of scouts is required goes against what is
normally found in most simulations and studies (i.e. that for most of the time exploitation dominates
exploration, apart from in extremely variable environments).
>> We added the following sentence on lines 79:
“Honey bees choose between exploring for new resources or exploiting familiar ones based on colony [40]
and individual information [47,48]. Thus, the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation can be
adjusted both at the colony level, through allocation of foragers to either scouts or recruits, and at the
individual level, through variation in the persistence of visits to a known food source.”
I am sorry that this review was so negative. I hope the effort I put into this review demonstrates that it
was performed in a spirit of constructive criticism. The manuscript did have some laudable points. For
example, it manages what most modelling studies fail, namely to produce testable hypotheses (hypothesis
generation) in lines 356-360. Indeed, I wish the authors would have emphasised this more, instead of
ending the manuscript with a plea that someone else should do that.
>> We thank the reviewer for appreciating our model’s ability to produce testable hypotheses and we
value their input. We now further emphasize our ability to generate hypotheses in the abstract on the last
sentence (line 28):
“Our work provides new insights and generates new hypotheses into how variation in behavior at both
the individual and colony levels jointly impact the trade-off between exploring for new resources and
exploiting familiar ones.”
• “synergy” has a specific meaning – that one gets a stronger response from two effects together than
one would from adding both separate effects. I don’t think this is what the authors show.
>> We changed “synergistically” to “jointly” wherever it appears, including the title.
• Lines 23-4 – unclear
>> We changed the text on lines 23 to:
“Furthermore, changes to the persistence of scouts induced opposite effects from changes to the
persistence of recruits on the collective foraging of the colony.”
• Lines 37-8 – unclear
>> We now edited this sentence to read (line 38):
“However, variation among individuals in how persistently they perform a task is striking. This behavioral
variation can undermine the efficiency that is often associated with task specialization [7,8] because
individuals that are not persistent either do not perform a large proportion of the task or incur the costs
of task switching [9,10].”
• Line 52 – “behavioral variation in foraging behaviors” – inelegant
>> We changed this sentence to (line 55):
“Honey bees exhibit variation in foraging behaviors at both the worker and colony levels [28,29].”
• Line 127 – unclear – do the bees then fly exactly towards the report, or is there variation? I suspect
the latter, but the word “exactly” confuses matters.
>> The drifting vector of a recruit points to the exact location reported by the forager who recruited it.
However, the drifting vector only defines the bias of the random flight pattern. There is still a stochastic
contribution in the flight dynamics, which comes from the term <U+0001D70E>" <U+0001D451><U+0001D47E>- in equation (1). We clarify this
point on lines 139:
“Each of the newly recruited bees left the hive with their drifting vectors pointing exactly towards the
location reported by the recruiting scout. The direction of this drifting vector is the deterministic portion
of the flight dynamics (see <U+0001D497>" <U+0001D451><U+0001D461> in equation 1), which is accompanied by a stochastic contribution from
<U+0001D70E>" <U+0001D451><U+0001D47E>- .”
• Line 151 – “foraging” did you mean scouting?
>> Changed.
• Statistical analysis should not be carried out on model-derived data (White et al. 2014), as the results
are linked to sample size. Rather, use large numbers of models runs (500-1000) and provide descriptive
graphics.
>> We removed the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests and only kept the shaded areas in figures 1a,b which
represent 1.5s for each curve.
• Lines 222-223 – using 16% probability on a (I assume) Gaussian distribution doesn’t seem to describe
the data shown in 2c well.
>> The probability of stopping to exploit a particular patch refers to the value of the parameter lambda in
a geometric distribution. We now clarify this point on lines 242:
“This means that making the decision to stop exploiting a particular patch had a probability of 16% based
on the value of the lambda parameter of a geometric distribution that was fit to the data.”
• Some reported results are so obvious as to not require mentioning, e.g. line 236, the amount of food
collected increases over time. As food cannot be lost, this is a given, surely? Also line 265-6 and 368-9.
>> While we appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to shorten the text by removing information about our
results, we do not want to risk losing readers who might not think these points are trivial. Each of the
results the reviewer points out is reported because it is required for more complex arguments that follow
them:
1. On line 257 we state that the amount of resources goes up over time so that later we can discuss
the differences among various simulations in the rate at which the amount of resources goes up
on lines 259-264.
2. On line 284 we discuss what happens when there are no scouts because we are reporting on the
limits of our model. This is common practice when analyzing sets of Ordinary Differential
Equations.
3. On line 368 we mention that larger groups collect resources faster to place our results in the
context of previous modeling studies. We now clarify this point by editing the sentence to read:
“Changing the number of foragers (from 100 to 1500) did not qualitatively change how
persistence and colony composition interacted to achieve optimal resource collection (Figure
S2), although, in agreement with previous modeling efforts [57], larger colonies did induce
faster collection of resources.”
• Lines 389-393 – I find this reasoning unsatisfying – a bug fix would solve this problem; and it may not
even be a problem (Al Toufailia, Grüter, and Ratnieks 2013). Regardless, this belongs in the methods.
>> We removed this sentence.
• Line 400-403 – overlong sentence
>> We changed this sentence from passive to a direct form, and indexed each item to improve the
readability. The new version is on lines 421:
“Therefore, to fully understand the tradeoff between exploring for new resources and exploiting familiar
ones, we need to both (i) uncover the mechanisms that underlie behavioral persistence and task
allocation, and (ii) determine the time scales on which these processes act in different species that live in
different environments.”
RESPONSE TO REVIEWER #2
First up apologies for the delay in my review, I am about to leave for the field and haven’t had the
opportunity to give this the attention it deserves.
That said, I can see that it is good work that is well thought out and conducted, and seems to have been
through review before as there are few errors that I can see. I like the paper, think it makes a good
contribution to our understanding of collective composition, and I would only recommend minor changes
before acceptance.
>> We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of our manuscript.
This is a modeling paper, but from the abstract this is not as clear as it could be. I would ask the authors
to make it clearer that the model is parameterised by empirical data, and are therefore obviously relevant
to biological systems, but the results are from the model rather than measurements from actual hives.
>> We now emphasize that our findings are based on a computational model early on in the abstract (line
15):
“Here we use a detailed computational model to examine the joint impact of colony-level distribution
among tasks and behavioral persistence of individuals, (…)”
Is there a typo in equation 8b? It seems Yr should actually be Ys…?
>> We thank the reviewer for noticing this typo, it is now corrected. All equations derived from equation
8b were revised to ensure that this error was not propagated forward.

Dear Dr. Miles Padgett,
We appreciate the opportunity to re-submit a revised version of our manuscript, and thank the
editor for the time and effort dedicated to our manuscript. Please, find below a point-by-point
response to the second review from reviewer 1. In addition, we are providing an extended list of

We look forward to your decision.

Response to 2nd set of comments from Reviewer 1
The authors have done a very good job addressing most of my comments. They have taken my
comments seriously and invested a lot of effort in handling them. I was impressed by the authors
willingness to perform many of the labour-intensive tasks I asked for, including an addition on a
recruit-recruitment sensitivity analysis and a complete ODD protocol. The manuscript also reads
much better, and is easier (though far from easy) to follow. The ODD protocol is particularly clear
and helpful. The authors also handled my comments about the empirical aspect of the
experiment well, giving details where needed, and convincing me that the data is appropriate for
use. All in all, a laudable improvement.
>> We thank the reviewer for appreciating our efforts.
However, I am afraid I still have concerns about the biological realism of the model. My concern
comes from a mismatch between the empirical data the authors collected on persistence (and
found in other studies), and the predicted optimal performance of the bees in the model. In figure
2c we see that the majority of bees make between 0 and 5 return visits – i.e. have a persistence
of between 0 and 5. Average persistence is probably 2.9, with on average 3.2 return trips.
>> The average persistence we observed and reported in the paper is 6.1 ± 0.3 (see line 242),
based on data from over 300 honey bees, and not 3.2 as the reviewer suggests. The persistence
observed in our experiments is in complete agreement with the persistence observed in other
studies, such as those pointed out by the reviewer in their first round of comments, and which
we now cite, as detailed in our previous response letter.
To emphasize the observed values, we now include them in the caption of Figure 3 (line 253):
“The average persistence was 6.1 ± 0.3.”
However, as the authors state “the absolute amount of resources collected per colony continued
to grow when persistence increased beyond 20 visits per individual”, as can also be seen in figure
3e. If the model reflects reality, bees would be under very strong selection to have very high
persistence. But bees show low persistence. This implies either that the model correctly reflects
the real world, but that the environment honey bees evolved under is radically different from
their current environment (which is somewhat unlikely), or that the model does not reflect reality
very well.
>> This result of our model indeed led us to our further extensive investigation of the relative
effect of scout persistence and recruit persistence on the amount of resources collected, these
two persistence values act in opposite directions on the optimal proportion of scouts, thus
creating a tradeoff between the proportion of scouts and resources collected that likely explains
the limit on the empirical persistence we observed. As this point was not clear to the reviewer
we now add a sentence immediately after the one the reviewer cites stating (lines 271): “This
result led us to further investigate the relationship between the total amount of resources
collected and the persistence of recruits and of scouts, as detailed below.”
In my previous review I suspected that this mismatch between the model results and reality was
due to a lack of recruitment by recruits in the model, but the authors convincingly demonstrated
that I was wrong.
>> Because (i) the reviewer did not point out the specific way in which our model is incompatible
with reality, and (ii) reviewer 2 did not raise any issues in this respect, it is not clear to us what
mismatch between model and reality the reviewer is referring to. Our model parameters are
entirely based on experimental results and the model outcomes produce novel hypotheses that
have never been tested.
I now suspect that the lack of depletion in the model, or generally the completely stable
environment, is causing this mismatch between the model and reality, but again I might be
wrong. The authors argue that the modelled stable environment “have biological significance for
foraging in patchy resources that cannot be depleted in a single day, such as blooming trees or
meadows.” This may or may not be true – such resources may change in productivity significantly
throughout the day. I simply do not know. Or such resources may not represent the most
important nectar source for honeybees. Again, I do not know.
>> The reviewer brings up interesting questions that are beyond the scope of our current work.
Our goal was to examine how persistence and task allocation jointly impact collective outcomes
at the colony level in a stable state. The questions the reviewer keeps bringing up about the
effects of environmental dynamics emphasize the importance of our work to generate new
hypotheses, some of which we are currently investigating both empirically and theoretically.
However, this is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. To avoid confusion, we removed
from line 422 “such as blooming trees or meadows.”
It could even be that it is the fact that all bees show the same persistence level in the model,
while in reality we have a large inter-individual variation (see also (Pamir et al., 2011)).
>> We completely agree that bees exhibit variation in persistence, and we indeed examined the
effect of introducing such individual variation in behavior to our model in earlier iterations.
However, because our model output examines the average outcome of the entire colony, the
end result was only significantly impacted by the average persistence in the colony, regardless of
how it is distributed within a task group. This is also the reason why our mean field solution was
able to explain most of the outcomes of our agent-based model. Individual variation in
persistence might impact the dynamics of the model, which is beyond the scope of this work.
I am very positively inclined towards this work, as the authors have done such a good job
responding to my previous comments, so have tried hard to reconcile the predicted behaviour of
the bees from the model with the empirical data presented (and available from other sources).
Sadly, I have failed, and so cannot convince myself that this model is a good representation of
reality.
>> No model can ever represent reality 100%. The goal of models is to help us think about
complex systems using the fewest number of parameters possible, generate new hypotheses,
and guide further empirical work. Despite the inherent downsides of (any and all) theoretical
work our model results in fact match quite well the empirical work we present, as discussed
above, and produces interesting and testable hypotheses.
However, perhaps I am missing something. I don’t have access to Python and never learned to
use it, so couldn’t explore the model myself.
>> An evaluation of theoretical work does not require being able to read the code. Perhaps, this
was one of the reasons the reviewer asked to be excused from making a decision on our
manuscript (see below, “I would like to abstain from making a recommendation about this
manuscript”). To make sure that anyone is able to reproduce our results, we provided a detailed
example for non-experts showing how to test our model and reproduce Figure 3b:
https://github.com/VandroiyLabs/ABBAS/tree/master/documentation/Submitted%20Paper
It may have been a great help to have a stand-alone applet one could explore.
>> This request for a stand-alone applet goes beyond the scope of any modeling work we’ve ever
encountered. We provide extremely detailed documentation (as acknowledged by the reviewer)
and the complete code of our simulations which can be further evaluated by any motivated
researcher. Python is one of the most popular and versatile programing languages currently being
used. One possibility would be to ask the assistance of an engineering or computer science
undergraduate student in modifying the source code.
Or perhaps I have misunderstood the role of this model: perhaps the model is not meant to
represent reality, but explore a what-if scenario of best practice under ideal conditions.
>> The goal of models, including the one we present, is to provide insights for future experimental
work. This particular reviewer explicitly acknowledged our ability to do so in their previous round
of comments: “The manuscript did have some laudable points. For example, it manages what
most modelling studies fail, namely to produce testable hypotheses (hypothesis generation) in
lines 356-360.”
The discussion raises interesting points, such as “the ratio between scouts and recruits, and
individual-level traits, such as the persistence of foragers, interact to impact collective foraging”,
And that “recruits may be the ones driving the adjustment of the colony’s exploration
exploitation strategy in response to both external and internal conditions” It is just not clear to
me that the specific conclusions drawn from the model can reliably represent reality.
>> Indeed, these points remain to be tested empirically. All the statements that the reviewer
brings here apply to our findings from the model and so they are completely accurate.
Again, I am really very sorry to raise these doubts and be so negative– especially at this late
stage in the review process. Given the conflict between the great job the authors have done
with my comments, and my continuing doubts about the validity of the manuscript, I would like
to abstain from making a recommendation about this manuscript. As I am not given this option,
I will be ticking the “reject” option, but strongly urge the editor to seek a second (third) opinion
on the matter.
>> Because of the very positive feedback from reviewer 2 and our extensive edits in response to
all of reviewer 1 current and previous comments, we respectfully ask the editor to consult a third
reviewer, as suggested here.
Minor comments:
• The video associated with the model in the ODD protocol seems to show depletion of the
resources. This confused me a bit, as the resources in this paper are non-depleting (line 178).
>> The video is now updated.
Appendix C
Review by Samuel Beshers, Dept of Entomology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
This paper describes a model of foraging in honey bees and asks how two features of the system
(fraction of foragers that act as scouts and persistence of foragers returning to the same resource)
affect overall colony performance. The authors use both simulation and system dynamics
(ordinary differential equations) versions of the model.
Colony organization, task allocation and decision making are important topics of study, with
potential interest well beyond social insect biology, and simulation and mathematical models
should be important tools in this area of research.
Apparently this paper has been re-submitted twice, after two reviews by Reviewer 1. Given that
history, I am somewhat surprised at the current state of the paper. There are a number of
significant flaws, each of which makes the paper unacceptable in current form. Some of these
could possibly be taken care of by editing, but others are firmly embedded in the authors’
conception of the paper and I am not sure there is any solution for them.
I have read with interest the comments of Reviewer 1, who expresses confidence in the model
but great uncertainty about the relationship of the model to reality. I am not concerned with the
model’s relationship to reality per se; the question is whether the paper tells us anything of
importance about honey bees or other social insects, and I believe the answer to that is No.
As I said above, I am not sure there is any solution to these problems but I think it is only fair to
point them out (for the second time, in at least one case) and give the authors another chance at
rebuttal.
1. Foraging in a static environment.
The past thirty years have taught us a great deal about how honey bees are able to exploit patchy
and ephemeral resources in a complex environment. Contributing to this are their abilities at
orientation and navigation, communication of location and distance, and rapid learning and
forgetting of flower patch locations, mediated in part by memories of visual and odor cues. It
stands to reason that their foraging system has been “designed” through selection to exploit such
environments.
And yet, as Reviewer 1 pointed out, the paper deals with foraging in an environment with
unlimited resources in three fixed locations. The response to this criticism was that
environments with limited and shifting resources “are beyond the scope of the present work.” If
so, then I think that maybe publication is also beyond the scope of the present work.
I understand, in the abstract, that it could make sense to start with a simple situation and then
extend a model to more complex situations. But here I do not believe they have established that
the simple case is of interest or that their results bear in any way on the more complex situation.
For the paper to be worthwhile, the authors need to make a compelling case that they have found
generalizable properties that will 1) still be valid in the complex environment and 2) provide
insights into how the bees exploit a complex environment. They have not attempted to make
such an argument, and I cannot imagine what that argument would be. They have shown that
scout allocation and persistence interact to affect colony foraging success, which is not a
surprise, but there is no conclusion that effectively captures what those interactions are, or how
they will translate to more complex environments. The final conclusion is that the model “can
thus be used to generate hypotheses for further empirical work…” but no such hypotheses are
actually generated, leaving me in doubt. In particular, the authors say nothing about what they
have found that will transfer to the complex environment problem.
I have doubts about whether scout allocation and persistence, as defined here, are really of
relevance for understanding the honey bee foraging system (see 2. Choice of variables,
below). So even if the authors can say something how their results may transfer to the complex
environment, I would still be skeptical about their importance.
I am also skeptical about the results as they stand, and their potential relevance for understanding
real honey bees. For example, with three fixed unlimited resources, it would seem to me that the
best strategy for a real honey bee colony is to have a small number of scouts (3?) go directly to
the resources they visited yesterday, confirm that they are still there, and have all other foragers
be recruits with infinite persistence (who may also recruit others) so that they go to the same
resource all day. This is trivial. It is also not what happens in the simulations here. Presumably
this is because of the lack of memory of the day before, but of course I don’t know. Even in a
real hive moved overnight to a new location, I think the exploitation of three unlimited resources
within 15 M would be swift and employ a quite small initial number of scouts. It would have
been good for the authors to set up some obvious expectations and show that the model conforms
to them before exploring further.
My conclusion is that I do not see any evidence of either general systems understanding, or of
results that would help us understand real bees.
2. Choice of variables to study
The authors have chosen to focus on the allocation to scouts, and on persistence (referred to in
the title as “site fidelity”). I have issues with both of these.
Allocation to scouts
The allocation of foragers to the roles of scout and recruit is important, but so is the total number
of foragers, and also the number active at any particular time. Social insect colonies generally
appear to have more foragers than are active at any one time, and recruits can be drawn from this
extra pool. Therefore the proportion of scouts to total foragers is not fixed, and the constraint
placed on the simulated colonies may limit the relevance of their behavior.
Persistence
The persistence of foragers is likely to be the result of a large number of factors; here it is treated
as a fixed trait of the individual forager. I expect that if the authors studied persistence in
marked foragers over several days (not easy to do because of losses, or workers that do not
forage every day) they would find that some are very consistent in their persistence and others
quite variable. I am not sure that fixed persistence is relevant.
Again, it is difficult to see how fixed values of allocation and persistence contribute to any
general systems understanding or help us to understand the real system.
3. Two agent-based models?
Starting with line 99, an agent-based model is described, and in lines 175 an apparently
completely different agent-based model is described, with no reference to the first. At least, the
parameters are so different that the authors cannot be referring to the same model. The key
parameter is distance: in the first model the resources are 15M away from the hive (an
unreasonably short distance) and in the second the foraging area is 1.3 km2, implying that
resources could be found considerably further from the nest, and providing plenty of room for
more resources to occur. I could not find any clarification of this, and in the figures there is no
indication of the conditions in which the simulations were run.
4. Quantum bees
The second is that in the simulations, as stated twice in different places, when a forager gets to
the limit of the available space its position is immediately reset to the hive and it starts foraging
again. This appears to be arbitrary yet bizarre, and needs to be at least explained or better still
changed. Why not have the bees just turn around???? I am not sure how this affects the results,
but it can’t be good.
To summarize, I see no evidence that this paper provides a step in an incremental effort to
understand honey bee foraging. It is up to the authors to show how their work on fixed variables
in static environments gives us insights into how the bees, with likely flexibility in these
variables (and in other relevant variables that are not considered here) forage in dynamic
environments, or how their results yield general systems understanding.

Dear Dr. Padgett,
Thank you for the time and effort that you and the reviewers dedicated to our manuscript. We
feel the manuscript has been greatly improved by the review process and appreciate the
opportunity to re-submit a revised version. Please find below a point-by-point response to the
reviews indicating the nature and location of changes using the line numbers from the revised
manuscript.
We look forward to your decision.
Sincerely,

Response to comments from Reviewer 3
1. Foraging in a static environment.
The past thirty years have taught us a great deal about how honey bees are able to exploit patchy and
ephemeral resources in a complex environment. Contributing to this are their abilities at orientation and
navigation, communication of location and distance, and rapid learning and forgetting of flower patch
locations, mediated in part by memories of visual and odor cues. It stands to reason that their foraging
system has been “designed” through selection to exploit such environments.
And yet, as Reviewer 1 pointed out, the paper deals with foraging in an environment with unlimited
resources in three fixed locations. The response to this criticism was that environments with limited and
shifting resources “are beyond the scope of the present work.” If so, then I think that maybe publication
is also beyond the scope of the present work. I understand, in the abstract, that it could make sense to
start with a simple situation and then extend a model to more complex situations. But here I do not believe
they have established that the simple case is of interest or that their results bear in any way on the more
complex situation.
>> We pose novel question about how the organization of the colony at multiple levels affects foraging
behavior. As the reviewer states towards the end of his comment, and as any scientist and modeler would
agree, when investigating a new question, one should start with the simplest scenario and only then
expand to more complex ones. As it is, our model is complex and introduces new ideas (as pointed out by
reviewer 4). Indeed, reviewer 1 agreed that a static environment is a good starting point for our work to
avoid an excessive number of parameters. In the second round of comments, reviewer 1 stated that a
dynamic environment would be the next step in our investigations, and they admitted that the evidence
we provide show that a dynamic environment may not change the main points we make in our paper
about the role of group composition and behavioral persistence. We provide ample supplementary
material that shows how our model results and predictions fare in more complex situations, such as
adding more resources, altering colony size, and adding recruitment rules. We refer to each of these
added complexities throughout our discussion and now add concluding sentences that state how our
model can be extrapolated to simulate complex scenarios on line 443:
“The way these levels of organization interact are not affected by the number of resources or colony size
(supplementary material). Other complexities, such as the depletion of resources, can be added to adapt
our model to more specific scenarios.”
For the paper to be worthwhile, the authors need to make a compelling case that they have found
generalizable properties that will 1) still be valid in the complex environment and 2) provide insights into
how the bees exploit a complex environment. They have not attempted to make such an argument, and I
cannot imagine what that argument would be.
>> The main purpose of this paper is to isolate the effects of the relationship between behavioral
persistence and task allocation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that explores the joint
effects of persistence and task allocation in connection with the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation of resources by honey bee colonies, we state this on lines (bring line numbers of the last
sentence of the abstract). Our conclusions about these relationships hold up when adding various
complexities, as detailed in our previous responses and as we detail in the paper (response to point 1) and
the supplementary material. In our paper, we have dealt with at least some complexities that can occur
under natural conditions, showing that our model is valid in a complex environment and that it provides
insights into natural situations. It is therefore difficult to understand the nature of the criticisms from this
reviewer, unless the point was that we need to address all possible complexities. The problem of course
with such broad criticism is that there are many ways to model such complexities. These include studying:
- the impact on collective outcomes of how quickly patches become depleted;
- how the recovery time of resources affects collective outcomes;
- what happens when patches become depleted at different rates;
- what bees do when all patches are depleted;
- how does the rate of the appearance of new patches affects foraging dynamics?
This list goes on to become a very long list of possible research topics that flow naturally from the model
we report in our manuscript. We use this short list to argue that our model helps make such future work
possible, which is why we consider our model to be a major step forward, not just an incremental advance,
toward providing a meaningful insight in social foraging.
They have shown that scout allocation and persistence interact to affect colony foraging success, which is
not a surprise, but there is no conclusion that effectively captures what those interactions are, or how
they will translate to more complex environments. The final conclusion is that the model “can thus be
used to generate hypotheses for further empirical work...” but no such hypotheses are actually generated,
leaving me in doubt. In particular, the authors say nothing about what they have found that will transfer
to the complex environment problem.
>> We added throughout the discussion explicit hypotheses generated by our model and details on how
they can be experimentally tested:
On line 406:
“Recent work suggests that persistence can be genetically determined [23], thus one could create colonies
with high persistence and examine the proportion of scouting bees emerging in these manipulated
colonies. Our model predicts that with high enough persistence, the proportion of scouts should drop by
about 40%. Alternatively, because evidence shows that scouting is genetically determined [18], one could
also manipulate the proportion of scouts in a colony, and examine if colonies with a greater ratio between
proportion of scouts and persistence gather fewer resources.”
On line 428:
“Our model predicts that the proportion of scouts that optimizes collection of resources drops by half if
the recruitment is reduced by a factor of 10 (Figure S5). This prediction can be tested by reducing
communication in the hive, for example by turning the hive on its side or capturing recruited bees.”
Furthermore, we updated the last paragraph of our paper to clarify the general conclusions of our paper
and highlight the broad impacts of our work:
“In conclusion, we showed that both colony-level composition and individual-level traits interact to impact
collective outcomes. The way these levels of organization interact are not affected by the number of
resources or colony size (supplementary material). Other complexities, such as the depletion of resources,
can be further added to adapt our model to more specific scenarios. Further investigation of the
mechanisms that underlie behavioral persistence and task allocation, and examination of the time scales
on which these processes act in different species and in different environments will advance our
understanding of the collective tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.”
I have doubts about whether scout allocation and persistence, as defined here, are really of relevance for
understanding the honey bee foraging system (see 2. Choice of variables, below). So even if the authors
can say something how their results may transfer to the complex environment, I would still be skeptical
about their importance.
>> We find this comment puzzling because of the extensive literature on this topic and because of the
empirical data we present. One point of our work is to establish whether and under what conditions our
variables, task allocation and persistence, are important. Doubts, such as the ones this reviewer has, are
fine to have at the outset of any work. But sometimes those doubts disappear in the face of experimental
tests. It certainly should not be the case that doubts become reality by default in the absence of
experiments.
As already detailed in the manuscript, our model is based on empirical observations, either
collected by our team or previously published. Our definitions of persistence and who is a scout are firmly
grounded in biological observations and thus our model is explicitly relevant to understanding honey bee
foraging. Here are some examples from the text where we explicitly show that our model is based on
biological findings:
Line 129:
“The dispersion of recruited bees (<U+0001D70E>" = 2) was fitted using data from experiments with feeders positioned
at distances varying from meters to kilometers [32].”
Line 130:
“To differentiate between the flight patterns of bees that are exploring the environment and those that
are exploiting a resource patch, are familiar with its location, and are therefore faster and more precise,
we assigned <U+0001D463>" = 1 to scouts, and <U+0001D463>" = 1.5 to recruits, following [57].”
Line 244:
“We estimated the values for the parameters in our model based on the empirical observations.
Interestingly, all bees exhibited the same rate of visits to the feeders (Figure 2a), which was 0.4 ± 0.2
visits per minute (Figure 2b). This visitation rate allowed us to set the model parameter <U+0001D463>" for flight velocity
to a constant value for all foragers after their first visit at a resource. The empirical distribution of intervals
between consecutive visits to the feeder (Figure 2b) informed the visitation interval of our model. The
observed average visitation interval < <U+0001D461> > was linearly related to the distance <U+0001D451> between hive and feeder
(R = 95%, Figure S3): < <U+0001D6E5> > = <U+0001D6FC><U+0001D451> + <U+0001D6FD>, with a = 2.3 ± 0.3 and b = 0.28 ± 0.05.”
I am also skeptical about the results as they stand, and their potential relevance for understanding real
honey bees. For example, with three fixed unlimited resources, it would seem to me that the best strategy
for a real honey bee colony is to have a small number of scouts (3?) go directly to the resources they
visited yesterday, confirm that they are still there, and have all other foragers be recruits with infinite
persistence (who may also recruit others) so that they go to the same resource all day. This is trivial. It is
also not what happens in the simulations here. Presumably this is because of the lack of memory of the
day before, but of course I don’t know.
>> In figure 4 we show that the proportion of scouts that optimizes the collection of resources decreases
when the persistence of recruits increases. Thus, in our model a hive with very persistent recruits does
have a small number of scouts, but never just one (or three). While the reviewer suggests an elegant
algorithm for bees to find their resources, assuming scouts know their location a priori, honey bees do
not follow such a strategy in reality. We have never observed such a strategy in the experiments we
conducted or read about. Bee colonies are complex – as the reviewer points out – and require robust
transmission of information among individuals. Relying on information from just a single, or three, scouts
is not robust by any stretch of the imagination. Having so few scouts – one per resource patch as this
review describes above - for a colony of tens of thousands of workers could lead to misinformation,
miscommunication, and loss of bees, to name just a few potential pitfalls. Many complex biological
systems (including social insects) rely on multiple, independent and parallel signals to increase the
reliability of the group/collective response.
Even in a real hive moved overnight to a new location, I think the exploitation of three unlimited resources
within 15 M would be swift and employ a quite small initial number of scouts. It would have been good
for the authors to set up some obvious expectations and show that the model conforms to them before
exploring further. My conclusion is that I do not see any evidence of either general systems understanding,
or of results that would help us understand real bees.
>> Our current work (in preparation) and that of Liang et al suggest otherwise. As stated on line 235 we
set up our model based on this previous work which shows that bees do not deplete close resources very
rapidly, and not in a single day. We now add this information:
“We trained bees to find feeders, positioned at 3, 5 or 10m from the hive, one day before the experiments
began, following [18] and comparable to other studies that examine 20m [60]. These resources were
never depleted despite their proximity to the hive.”
As stated above, we now add explicit predictions and conclusions on lines 406, 428 and 442.
2. Choice of variables to study The authors have chosen to focus on the allocation to scouts, and on
persistence (referred to in the title as “site fidelity”). I have issues with both of these.
Allocation to scouts
The allocation of foragers to the roles of scout and recruit is important, but so is the total number of
foragers, and also the number active at any particular time.
>> We agree with the reviewer that task allocation is not the only interesting variable to study, and we
indeed report on the effect of number of foragers in our results in the supplementary material.
Furthermore, by exploring the allocation of foragers to scouting or recruiting, we were able to investigate
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation and its implications on resource acquisition by the
colony.
Social insect colonies generally appear to have more foragers than are active at any one time, and recruits
can be drawn from this extra pool. Therefore the proportion of scouts to total foragers is not fixed, and
the constraint placed on the simulated colonies may limit the relevance of their behavior.
>> We agree that the number of inactive foragers is an important variable that is not included in our
simulation. We clarified this point on lines 182:
“For simplicity, we neglect the effect of inactive foragers [41] and we fixed the number of scouts and
recruits during each simulation”
Please note that our supplementary material about different colony sizes indirectly and partially addresses
the point the reviewer is making here by effectively increasing the pool of inactive foragers as colony sizes
increase.
Persistence
The persistence of foragers is likely to be the result of a large number of factors; here it is treated as a
fixed trait of the individual forager.
I expect that if the authors studied persistence in marked foragers over several days (not easy to do
because of losses, or workers that do not forage every day) they would find that some are very consistent
in their persistence and others quite variable. I am not sure that fixed persistence is relevant. Again, it is
difficult to see how fixed values of allocation and persistence contribute to any general systems
understanding or help us to understand the real system.
>> As stated in the manuscript, our simulations span one day of foraging (7h), thus variation across days
is not be included. The empirical data on which our models are based were also conducted at a time scale
of one day. We completely agree with the reviewer that there are many factors that can determine this
behavior. The mix of genetic, epigenetic and environmental mechanisms underlying persistence is
complicated, and we are in the midst of conducting large experimental study of these effects so that they
can be added to our model in a realistic way.
3. Two agent-based models? Starting with line 99, an agent-based model is described, and in lines 175 an
apparently completely different agent-based model is described, with no reference to the first. At least,
the parameters are so different that the authors cannot be referring to the same model. The key
parameter is distance: in the first model the resources are 15M away from the hive (an unreasonably short
distance) and in the second the foraging area is 1.3 km2, implying that resources could be found
considerably further from the nest, and providing plenty of room for more resources to occur. I could not
find any clarification of this, and in the figures there is no indication of the conditions in which the
simulations were run.
>> There is only one agent-based model. The distance between the hive and the patches is 15m, but the
total area simulated is 36m x 36m = 1.3km2. The model is described in three subsections, as follows:
* “Agent-Based Model” provides an overview of the model progression;
* “Flight dynamics” focuses on the details that drive the flight of each forager;
* “Collective outcomes” defines the variables we used to quantify colony success.
To make this structure evident, we added on line 108:
“In the following sections, we define the dynamics of each forager (section “Flight dynamics”) and
describe the variables used to quantify colony success (section “Collective outcomes”) within the Agent-
Based model.”
4. Quantum bees The second is that in the simulations, as stated twice in different places, when a forager
gets to the limit of the available space its position is immediately reset to the hive and it starts foraging
again. This appears to be arbitrary yet bizarre, and needs to be at least explained or better still changed.
Why not have the bees just turn around???? I am not sure how this affects the results, but it can’t be
good.
>> Making a bee turn around at the limits of the simulated area could be problematic, if not more, than
our current boundary condition. Such a condition forces all bees that reached our simulation boundaries
to turn back and continue to forage in an area they have already explored. Under natural conditions, when
a forager has failed to find food it could be close to an energy break point when it will starve if it does not
return directly to the colony when foraging. Because bees take only a small amount of honey with them
when they leave on a trip [c.f. Honey bee Ecology, Seeley], a failed trip a forager needs to fly straight back
to the hive. This direct return, instead of a meandering flight path taken during foraging, would be
equivalent to the ‘reset to the hive’ that we built into the model.
Moreover, observations of bees foraging in an enclosed tent show that foragers that reach the tent
(similar to our simulation boundaries) will simply keep flying against the tent wall, trying to escape,
sometimes until they die and so will not continue foraging. Because the observed hives have more bees
than in our simulations, and new foragers can come out to replace the ones that die because of bumping
repeatedly into the tent, we made the simulated bees at the boundary return to the hive immediately
(rather than die) so that we do not loose bees in our simulations.
Furthermore, we could not find information about how bees that do not find a resource behave on their
way back to the hive (when not in an enclosed tent), i.e., do they continue to look for food, stop collecting
food, fly directly to the hive, etc. Finally, as mentioned in our responses to referee 1, preliminary
simulations that we conducted showed that changing the boundary condition did not affect our results.
To summarize, I see no evidence that this paper provides a step in an incremental effort to understand
honey bee foraging. It is up to the authors to show how their work on fixed variables in static environments
gives us insights into how the bees, with likely flexibility in these variables (and in other relevant variables
that are not considered here) forage in dynamic environments, or how their results yield general systems
understanding.
>> We edited our conclusion paragraph and added explicit predictions throughout the discussion to better
explain the broad implications of our work on lines 182, 406, 428 and 442, as detailed in our responses
above.
Response to comments from Reviewer 4
The manuscript "Task allocation and site fidelity jointly influence foraging regulation in honey bee
colonies" explores the trade-offs between scouting and recruiting, exploration and exploitation, and
variation among individuals in their persistence to continue foraging at a specific location. The
introduction was complicated, though still contained enough information to make clear why the study
was being conducted. The model was complex, but all details on the implementation and parameters are
provided (either in text or in the supplement). One highlight of this study was that researchers include
behavioral experiments in order to estimate many of their parameters for the model.
>> We appreciate the time and effort that the reviewer dedicated to our manuscript.
My only major comment is regarding the discussion. As mentioned, the methods were very detailed and
complex, and the results showed clear patterns as parameters varied. I would have liked to have seen
more of the discussion linked back to how these patterns mimic natural honey bee patterns. e.g., 367-9:
"the percentage of scouts in honeybee colonies is between 5% and 35% [38]. These numbers are slightly
lower than the optimal proportions we found here and this difference can be explained by the parameter
choicse for the number of bees that respond to a waggle dance (Figure S3)." If the numbers do not match
what you observe in natural colonies, what are the biological constraints keeping colonies from
performing at the calculated optimal range? Otherwise, are you saying that the parameter choice for bees
responding to the dance are biologically unrealistic?
>> The percentage of scouts in our model is slightly higher than reported empirically by others, probably
because the recruitment rate was underestimated in our simulations, as detailed in the supplemental
material. Recruitment rate was one of the few parameters that we did not fit using experimental data,
because its measurement is challenging. Furthermore, we did not include recruitment in our initial model
because consistent information about it is difficult to find in the literature. However, after adding a term
for recruitment in response to a previous reviewer’s suggestion, we found that the only thing that is
affected by adding recruitment to our model is the amount of recourses gathered, but not the relationship
between scouts and recruits or the impact of persistence –which is the main focus of our paper. We detail
this in the supplementary material. We now further clarify this point in the text on lines 375:
“These numbers are slightly lower than the optimal proportions we found in our simulations. This
difference between empirical and simulated results can be eliminated by increasing the number of bees
that respond to a waggle dance in our simulations (Figure S5) and without changing any other parameter
in the model, or affecting any of our conclusions regarding persistence and task allocation (compare
Figures 3 with Figure S5).”
Lines 410-5: "It would be interesting to further investigate the effect of increasing collection efficiency on
collective dynamics in primitively social bees that exhibit division of labor but spatial information is not
shared during recruitment e. g., bumble bees [43], or halictine bees in which there are no known
mechanisms of recruitment [67]." This would be interesting, however, a number of studies have
investigated (empirically and through agent-based simulations) how behavior would change if
recruitment were removed from honey bees. The point that I'm trying to suggest here is not to add in
these specific refs, necessarily, but to emphasize that there are opportunities throughout the discussion
where putting these results in context with what is known about the actual biology of these systems would
really help clarify the main goals with this model.
>> We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, we added throughout the discussion links to further
empirical work (see responses to reviewer #3 above) and added the following sentences on lines 426:
“The effects of communication on these dynamics can also be studied in honeybees, for example by
hindering communication through tilting their hive [68], which substantially impairs foraging. Our model
predicts that the proportion of scouts that optimizes collection of resources drops by half if the
recruitment is reduced by a factor of 10 (Figure S5). This prediction can be tested by reducing
communication in the hive, for example by turning the hive on its side or capturing recruited bees.”
Line 428-30: "Our model can thus be used to generate hypotheses for further empirical work on the
regulation of collective behavior and its response to various environmental conditions." I absolutely agree
with this statement, and think that it can be strengthened with more evidence of how empirical work has
benefited from the development of models such as this in the past, and/or specifically what role this
model will have on the field going forward.
>> We agree with the reviewer. We now added specific predictions and ways to test them throughout the
discussion, as detailed in our response to reviewer 3 (lines 406, 428 and 442) and updated the last
paragraph of the paper (line 448):
“Our model serves as a springboard for such investigations and can be used to generate hypotheses for
further empirical work on the regulation of collective behavior and its response to various environmental
conditions., as many other models have contributed to empirical work [58,71].”
Minor Comments Lines 52-3: "For example, the decision of a honey bee to leave the hive and start foraging
is influenced by the bee’s genotype." I was under the impression that it was influenced by hormonal
changes that might be triggered by changes in gene expression. Perhaps you meant 'genome'?
>> Yes, we meant genome. We changed it in the manuscript.
Lines 53-5: Genetic variation can influence the likelihood that a bee leaves a patch? Genetic variation
might explain why some individuals choose to stay longer in a patch (thresholds to recognize a full crop
might vary?), but the genetic variation is not the mechanism that affects the bee's decision to leave. I
think this just needs to be rephrased.
>> We agree with the referee. We removed “leave” from that sentence.
Line 122: At T-0, did all scouts leave the nest, or was there some randomness written into the program as
to when they left?
At the beginning of the simulation, all scouts left the hive together. We updated the text on lines 124 to
make this detail evident:
“At the beginning of each simulation (t=0), all scouts left the hive, with drifting vectors <U+0001D463>" assigned from a
uniform distribution, and continued flying until they found a resource.”
Line 125: Did scouts recruit every time they returned with food? Is this realistic?
>> In our simulations, scouts recruited at a certain probability, as detailed on line 138. Experiments show
that honey bees may perform the waggle dance in many of their return trips. However, we could not find
reports of empirical work that quantifies recruitment across return trips. If recruitment happens at every
return trip, then the results would be similar to those presented in the section “Increasing the rate of
recruitment,” in the supplemental material. We now further elaborate in that section (on lines 93):
“Increasing the rate of recruitment decreased the proportion of scouts that was required to collect the
maximum amount of food (Figure S5a), regardless of whether recruitment happened only after the first
return trip or after all return trips.”
Line 133: Was the recruitment behavior the same for all scouts (did it vary with food type or distance or
randomly?)
>> Because we did not used different types of food, and all patches had the same distance to the hive, we
did not include variation in recruitment. However, these effects could be easily included in our model by
changing the duration of the dance and the recruitment rate.
We now mention this in the methodology (on lines 142):
“Distance and quality of food are also communicated in the waggle dance [32,58] and variation in food
distance and quality could be easily incorporated in further investigation of our model by varying the
number of recruited foragers that respond to each scout and the time that each scout spends recruiting.”
Figures S1-S3 are not mentioned in the text (at least before S4 is mentioned).
>> We changed the order of the figures in the supplemental materials and updated their references in the
main text.
Lines 224-254: Behavioral assays were conducted on bees 3, 5, and 10 m from the hive to collect
parameter values. However, data are presented together. Why were data collected at three different
distances if data were to be pooled for analysis?
>> We conducted behavioral assays in different distances to understand how persistence would change
over distance. For instance, we used this data to predict the interval between consecutive visits to the
hive used in our model (see line 249). The data in figure 2 is from one experiment at a distance of 5m (see
line 259). To complement figure 2, and present data from all distances, we now provide in the
supplemental material data from different distances separately and refer the reader on figure S3.
Line 280: 'discovering' should be 'discover'
>> Fixed.
Line 288: the way the model is designed, if a = 0, then no one ever leaves to initially forages, so no food
will be collected. But what if scouts do not recruit after every foraging bout?
>> In the System Dynamics model, all processes are described by their occurrence rates, e.g. g is the
recruitment rate. In this approach, there is no detailed temporal or spatial descriptions of individual rules.
Thus, the equivalent of scouts not recruiting after every foraging bout in this model would be smaller
values of g. According to our analytical solutions, when g decreases, the proportion of scouts that
optimizes the collection of resources increases, while the total amount of food decreases. This is
equivalent to what is observed in the agent-based model when the recruitment rate is changed (compare
figures S1, S5 and 3).
Line 282-3: "However" is repeated twice in the same sentence
>> Fixed.
Appendix E
This is my second review of this paper. In this resubmission the authors have gone to some
effort to respond to my concerns and those of the other reviewers, for which I commend them.
In my previous review I questioned several aspects of the approach, including the choice of
variables to study and whether any results would generalize to the more complex environments
in which real honey bees live. This revised version does nothing to change my overall view of
the paper.
However, there is no objective right or wrong here, and I think it is appropriate to let the
community decide the value of this work. Part of the issue is the state of the field, and
particularly of modeling and theory; we have a long way to go, and there is no general agreement
on how to proceed, so it is only reasonable to grant the authors their approach and see how it
plays out.
There are still a couple of issues that need to be addressed:
Quantum bees: I complained in the previous version that bees that reached the edge of the
foraging area had their position immediately reset to the hive, and I got this response:
Making a bee turn around at the limits of the simulated area could be problematic, if not
more, than our current boundary condition. Such a condition forces all bees that reached our
simulation boundaries to turn back and continue to forage in an area they have already
explored. Under natural conditions, when a forager has failed to find food it could be close
to an energy break point when it will starve if it does not return directly to the colony when
foraging. Because bees take only a small amount of honey with them when they leave on a
trip [c.f. Honey bee Ecology, Seeley], a failed trip a forager needs to fly straight back to
the hive [my emphasis]. This direct return, instead of a meandering flight path taken during
foraging, would be equivalent to the ‘reset to the hive’ that we built into the model.
This is really pretty irritating. The obvious solution is to have the bees fly straight back to the
hive, as in the above paragraph, and not move there instantly. Why not do that? Nothing says
the bee has to continue foraging after it turns around.
Foraging area: I asked for clarification about the size of the foraging area and whether there
were two agent-based models, since in one place it says that the food sources were 15m from the
hive and in another that the total area was 1.3km2, meaning that there was a great deal of area
beyond the food sources.
I received this response:
There is only one agent-based model. The distance between the hive and the patches is 15m,
but the total area simulated is 36m x 36m = 1.3km2.
This is a problem; there appears to be some confusion about what a square kilometer is. Just to
be clear, a square kilometer is 1000m on a side, not 31.6m. You could say this is just a trivial
matter of labeling but it is not; no honey bee biologist would think that foraging up to 30m is the
same as foraging up to 1000m, and a decision to have the bees forage in such a small area needs
to be explicitly stated and defended.
On the title page, I think Pinter-Wollman should be associated with UCLA; otherwise none of
the authors is.

Response to comments from Reviewer 3

current boundary condition. Such a condition forces all bees that reached our simulation boundaries to
turn back and continue to forage in an area they have already explored. Under natural conditions, when
a forager has failed to find food it could be close to an energy break point when it will starve if it does not
return directly to the colony when foraging. Because bees take only a small amount of honey with them
when they leave on a trip [c.f. Honey bee Ecology, Seeley], a failed trip a forager needs to fly straight back
to the hive [my emphasis]. This direct return, instead of a meandering flight path taken during foraging,
would be equivalent to the ‘reset to the hive’ that we built into the model.
This is really pretty irritating. The obvious solution is to have the bees fly straight back to the hive, as in
the above paragraph, and not move there instantly. Why not do that? Nothing says the bee has to
continue foraging after it turns around.
>> We now ran more simulations in which bees fly back to the hive when they reach the edge of the
foraging area and provide those results in the supplemental material. Having bees physically return
through the foraging arena has no impact on our results and conclusions. All this change does is slightly
delay the dynamics, but there is no impact on the main points of the paper regarding the relationship
between scouts and recruits and the impact of persistence on collective outcomes. As we mentioned in
our previous response (which is not fully transcribed above), a more realistic scenario is that bees would
keep flying past the resource patches for a larger distance than our foraging arena before going back to
the hive. Thus, we now show in the supplementary material two scenarios in which the bees fly to
distances of 250m and 500m. We refer to this supplement on lines 162-164:
“For simplicity, this reassignment was instantaneous, but adding a return trip or changing the distance
explored by these foragers before they return to the hive did not change our findings (Figure S2).”
Foraging area: I asked for clarification about the size of the foraging area and whether there were two
agent-based models, since in one place it says that the food sources were 15m from the hive and in
another that the total area was 1.3km2, meaning that there was a great deal of area beyond the food
sources.
I received this response: There is only one agent-based model. The distance between the hive and the
patches is 15m, but the total area simulated is 36m x 36m = 1.3km2.
This is a problem; there appears to be some confusion about what a square kilometer is. Just to be clear,
a square kilometer is 1000m on a side, not 31.6m. You could say this is just a trivial matter of labeling but
it is not; no honey bee biologist would think that foraging up to 30m is the same as foraging up to 1000m,
and a decision to have the bees forage in such a small area needs to be explicitly stated and defended.
>> We thank the reviewer for pointing this typo. It is indeed an area of 36m by 36m. We fixed this in the
text (line 184): “Simulated colonies consisted of 300 foragers that were allowed to forage for 7h in an area
equivalent to 36m x 36m = 1296m2.”
