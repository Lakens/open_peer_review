This is a nice study which adds to the growing literature on the topic of juvenile natal homing
and natal foraging philopatry.
The paper should be published but with modification to the discussion. The data does not
support the absence of an oceanic stage and much of this section should be removed. There is
growing evidence that immature hawksbills are making long distance migrations and this is a
likely mechanism for this result. Both options can be discussed but there is more evidence for the
immature migration.

Here tissue samples are collected from juvenile hawksbill turtles over a broad range of foraging
grounds in the eastern Pacific. The mtDNA of these turtles is examined and the origin of the
turtles is assessed in relation to nesting beaches (rookeries) in the area. Juvenile turtles tended to
originate from local, rather than distant, rookeries.

This is a nice study that I enjoyed reading. Throughout the writing and reporting of the results is
clear. I think this work will make a nice contribution. I have some relatively minor suggestions
that, with a little care, will be relatively easy for the authors to attend to.
1. The authors talk about hatchling dispersal by ocean currents. It has been suggested that
hatchlings imprint on foraging sites they encounter while drifting. So if they do not drift far from
their natal beach, then their foraging sites will similarly be close to the natal beaches.
Furthermore, as part of this link between currents/foraging sites, another suggestion, supported
by empirical evidence, is that if hatchlings are dispersed to very distant sites (>3000 km away),
then this is too far for reproductive migrations to the natal beach. So in those cases, individuals
travel back closer to their natal beach to find a foraging area and this means that they end up
foraging close to their natal beach. See: Scott R et al. (2014) Ontogeny of long distance migration.
Ecology 95, 2840-2850. doi: 10.1890/13-2164.1
So these are two mechanisms that predict foraging sites will sometimes be close to natal beaches.
So it would be worth discussing these ideas presented by Scott et al.
2. Methods. I would briefly explain how you got your hands on the turtles. Caught by rodeo ?
Caught by fishermen ?
3. The size of turtles is measured (curve carapace length). So I would consider in the results if the
probability of a turtle coming from the local rookery is linked to carapace length.
4. It wasn't clear to me that the supporting data was available, so I would clarify this issue.
In summary a nice manuscript that will make a strong contribution.

Overall this study is interesting and discrete study that shows that turtles found in foraging
grounds near nesting sites are closely related to nesters near the same foraging grounds. That is
interesting, but the results are difficult to interpret as some key data is missing, and some of the
points feel overstated. Specifically:
- Size range of turtles in foraging areas: Without data on the size of turtles (beyond the mean - p5,
line 44) found in the foraging areas it is difficult to interpret if the conclusions are appropriate. A
histogram or something that displays the data would be helpful.
- It seems to me that the implication that no pelagic stage exists, or that pelagic stages aren’t as
ubiquitous is overstated. For this study, it could be that juveniles settle in neritic foraging
grounds when they are 40 cm - and are pelagic before that. Adult CCL is only ~68 so it is not so
far off from adult stage. Additionally the message in the paper seems to waffle - is the novelty
that they don’t have a pelagic stage (not supported, at least not with the CCL data provided) or
that they come back to natal foraging grounds when they are still in the juvenile stage (which is
seen in other areas already?). I ended up feeling confused about the novelty of the study, at least
as pitched.
Abstract
line 18: Our findings confirm << other studies refute >> that traditional views of natal homing…
Introduction
p3, lines 11-16: I don’t know that this is true. Many species - leatherbacks, olive ridleys to name
two - forage in pelagic regions as adults. Even some species move between pelagic and neritic
zones as juveniles such as green turtles off of South America. This is a broad generalization that
does not seem accurate.
p3, lines 22-23: I don’t personally see this as a ubiquitous pattern.
p3, lines 42-49: This seems overstated; there are 7 studies you cite that show otherwise. I think
the larger issue is that we don’t know much about most populations across species across both
hatchling or young adult stages. Additionally in the discussion you note that in one of the Bio of
Sea Turtles this actually even has a name (Type 1 hatchling development pattern).
Methods
Suggest changing terminology from simply ‘rookery’ to ‘nesting rookery’ - foraging rookery is
also common terminology and would aid the reader.
p5, lines 31-33: how many individuals were removed?
Results
See comment above about CCLs
Figure 1 is very nicely done and corresponds well to the text.
Discussion
p6, lines 22-25: Please provide information on the size of the nesting rookeries.
p6, lines 33-36: This seems like an obvious statement to me. More surprising would be if it was
for rookeries far from each other. Also here it is important to know the number of individuals
removed form the study for unobserved haplotypes - and how many haplotypes were observed
within the removed group.
p6, lines 53-60: Hawksbills are known to be coastal in many areas as juveniles (Caribbean for
example) - this doesn’t seem surprising to me.
p7, lines 4-34: I don’t see how this section follows - seems a bit out of place and I don’t follow and
obvious line of thinking here. Of more interest would de what hawksbills do in other parts of the
world (e.g. the Caribbean where they are known to be neurotic). Also, its difficult to say for
certain but with your standard deviation, I am guessing your foraging rookery turtles don’t get as
small as 15 cm.

This is a nice study, well thought through and written. It presents data that supports natal
foraging philopatry (NFP) in Eretmochleys imbricata. This study is a good contribution to the
understanding of sea turtles biology, and should be published. I think that the authors have
adequately answered the questions raised by the previous reviewers. Based on the information
presented by the authors I do agree with them that the NFP may be due to a truncated or absent
hatchling/juvenile oceanic phase or due to juvenile natal homing, but more studies are needed to
clarify this topic. I think that, coupled with currents patterns related to the inshore nesting
beaches, another factor that may help to explain a possible absence of oceanic phase is that the
mangroves may provide protection to the hatchlings against predation, therefore working as a
nursery habitat (well known fact to fishes and invertebrates). Minor suggestionDiscussion:Page

SUMMARY
1
2 The complex processes involved with animal migration have long been a subject of biological
3
4 interest and broad-scale movement patterns of many marine turtle populations still remain
5
6 unresolved. While it is widely accepted that once marine turtles reach sexual maturity they home to
7
8
9 natal areas for nesting or reproduction, the role of philopatry to natal areas during other life stages
10
11 has received less scrutiny, despite widespread evidence across the taxa. Here we report genetic
12
13 research that indicates that juvenile hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in the eastern Pacific
14
15 Ocean also use foraging grounds in the region of their natal beaches, a pattern we term natal foraging
16
17
philopatry (NFP). Our findings confirm that traditional views of natal homing solely for reproduction
18
19
20 are incomplete and that many marine turtle species exhibit philopatry to natal areas to forage. Our
21
22 results have important implications for life-history research and conservation of marine turtles and
23
24 may extend to other wide-ranging marine vertebrates that demonstrate natal philopatry.

2 INTRODUCTION
3
4 Understanding movement patterns is an essential component of successful wildlife
5
6
7
management [1,2]. The movement and dispersal of highly migratory marine organisms such as
8
9 marine turtles have been studied for decades (e.g., [3,4]) and some broad-scale patterns have become
10
11 widely accepted. For instance, it is generally accepted that most post-hatchling turtles spend a multi-
12
13 year period in open ocean gyres before recruiting to more geographically fixed neritic foraging
14
15
grounds [5,6,7,8]. An abundance of research has also shown that once reaching sexual maturity,
16
17
18 which can take between 10-50 years [9], most turtles return to the vicinity of their natal beaches to
19
20 nest or reproduce (i.e., natal homing sensu [10]).
21
22 Despite the apparent ubiquity of these patterns, the specific dispersal behavior of
23
24 marine turtles to foraging grounds in relation to natal nesting beaches, termed rookeries, remains
25
26
27 complex [11]. Particle simulation modeling and satellite tracking of post-hatchling turtles suggest a
28
29 range of dispersal pathways over thousands of kilometers, indicating settlement in foraging areas can
30
31 occur over extremely large spatial scales (e.g., [12,13,14,15]). Genetic research has demonstrated that
32
33 foraging grounds are typically made up of individuals from multiple rookeries, further highlighting
34
35
the potentially diffuse distribution of post-hatchling turtles [11]. Recent studies have found that
36
37
38 juvenile loggerhead, (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys
39
40 imbricata) turtles in the Atlantic actively home to foraging grounds in the vicinity of their natal
41
42 habitats [16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. Despite evidence supporting this pattern across several marine turtle
43
44 species, current literature largely fails to recognize philopatry to natal areas during early life stages as
45
46
47 part of general marine turtle life history strategy and, as a result, this concept has yet to be
48
49 incorporated into marine turtle spatial ecology and species management.
50
51 In this study, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of juvenile and adult
52
53 hawksbills from the eastern Pacific Ocean to evaluate the species’ distribution at foraging grounds
54
55
relative to natal rookeries and to assess the evidence of foraging philopatry to natal areas. Hawksbill
56
57
58 turtles were considered virtually absent from the eastern Pacific Ocean as recently as 2007 [23] and
59
60 remain one the worlds most threatened marine turtle regional management units [24]. Although
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos R. Soc. open sci.
Page 5 of 19 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
extensive field research over the past 10 years has revealed important hawksbill rookeries and
1
2 foraging grounds, there are still considerable gaps in our understanding of dispersal of post-hatchling
3
4 turtles to foraging areas or how rookeries contribute to foraging grounds. Additionally, several
5
6 unique life-history characteristics have been discovered for hawksbills in this ocean region that could
7
8
9 potentially influence the dispersal of hatchlings and rookery contributions, including highly neritic
10
11 habitat use, restricted home ranges, and limited migrations [25,26,27], heightening interest in genetic
12
13 research of hawksbills at foraging grounds.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
19
20 Sample collection and processing
21
22 We collected tissue samples from hawksbill turtles at foraging grounds along the eastern
23
24 Pacific rim (Figure 1) between 2004 and 2015 using a combination of direct monitoring, strandings
25
26 and fisheries bycatch monitoring activities. We used rookery samples from [28], which were
27
28
29 supplemented by seven additional rookery samples. When feasible, we measured the curved carapace
30
31 length (CCL) for all hawksbills encountered and applied Inconel flipper tags (National Band and Tag,
32
33 Newport, KY, USA) to allow for ongoing identification. After collection, samples were placed in
34
35 vials containing > 95% ethanol or water saturated with sodium chloride, which were subsequently
36
37
stored in a -20°C freezer.
38
39
40 We amplified a 766 base pair segment of mtDNA from the control region of hawksbill tissue
41
42 samples following the protocol outlined in [28]. Haploytpes (KT934080, KT934070, KT964296,
43
44 KR012503, KR012504, KT003685, KT072795, KR012505, KT072797, KU695258, KU695259,
45
46 KX646708, KT934051) were determined using Geneious v. R8 (Biomatters Inc., Newark, NJ, USA)
47
48
49 and aligned against sequences in a local reference library, as well as those found in the GenBank
50
51 database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
52
53
54
55 Data analysis
56
57
We calculated FST values for rookeries and foraging grounds using Arlequin v 3.5.1.2 [29].
58
59
60 Because we were interested in identifying broad-scale genetic patterns and had variable sample sizes

1
2 (mean n = 12.4, s.d. = 24.8) from disparate foraging grounds, we pooled samples to create regional
3
4 foraging grounds (RFGs). To determine which samples would be included in each RFG, we
5
6
7
conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) in the package GenAlEx v.6.5 [30] on FST values
8
9 for eight foraging grounds for which we had sample sizes ranging from n = 20-117 (Figure 1). The
10
11 samples from the foraging grounds in each PCA cluster were then combined with neighboring
12
13 foraging grounds for which we had sample sizes ranging from n = 1–7 (Figure 1).
14
15
We used Bayesian mixed stock analysis (MSA) in the software ‘BAYES’ [31] to estimate the
16
17
18 contribution of rookeries to each RFG. The two rookeries in RFG2 were combined into a single
19
20 regional estimate due to both their proximity and genetic similarity. For the MSA we ran a total of
21
22 four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using uniform priors, coinciding with the number of
23
24 potential source rookeries, with each MCMC consisting of 50,000 steps initiated at different starting
25
26
27 points. We used a burn-in of 25,000 steps and calculated the posterior distribution from the remaining
28
29 25,000 for all chains, then ran the Gelman and Rubin shrink factor diagnostic to test that all chains
30
31 had converged (i.e., < 1.2) [31]. Individuals with haplotypes not observed in rookeries (i.e., orphan
32
33 haplotypes) were removed from the study.
34

36
37
38 RESULTS
39
40 We obtained 766 bp sequences from the mtDNA control region for hawksbill turtles samples
41
42 collected at 45 foraging grounds (n=535) and five rookeries (n=267) in nine countries (Figure 1).
43
44 Samples collected at foraging grounds included hawksbills average CCL 50.8 cm (s.d. = 13.9).
45
46
47 Our PCA identified four distinct clusters (see Supplemental Figure 1 for PCA results), leading
48
49 to the creation four RFGs (mean sample size n = 133.8, s.d. = 78.7). FST values indicated highly
50
51 significant (P < 0.001) structure among all potential source rookeries except for two located in RFG1
52
53 and RFG4. However, these rookeries are separated by >3,500 km and it is extremely unlikely that
54
55
they are demographically homogeneous [32], thus both were treated as independent source rookeries
56
57
58 in our MSA.

Results of our MSA indicated that rookeries located in each RFG (Figure 1) contribute the
1
2 overwhelming majority (average = 80.5%, s.d. = 10.5) of turtles to foraging grounds in that same
3
4 RFG (Figure 2; see Supplemental Table 1 for detailed MSA results).

9 DISCUSSION
10
11 Although it has long been established that upon reaching sexual maturity, marine turtles
12
13 return to the vicinity of their natal beaches to nest or reproduce [10], the potential role of philopatry
14
15 to foraging areas during juvenile stages has remained largely overlooked as a general life-history trait
16
17
within the taxon. Our results indicate that juvenile hawksbills in the eastern Pacific use foraging
18
19
20 grounds in the region of their source rookeries, a movement pattern we term natal foraging philopatry
21
22 (NFP). Despite major differences in the size of our source rookeries, i.e., annual nests among
23
24 rookeries varied in some cases by an order of magnitude, our results indicate that rookeries in each
25
26 region, irrespective of their size, were the primary contributors to foraging grounds in the regions in
27
28
29 which they were found. Similarly, while our results indicate rookery contributions are a function of
30
31 distance, our findings demonstrate that rookeries in each region contributed virtually all turtles to
32
33 foraging grounds in those same regions (Figure 2). This finding was consistent even for regional
34
35 foraging grounds that were in close proximity to one another (e.g. RFG 1 and RFG 2).
36
37
Our results confirm recent studies that found evidence of NFP in Atlantic juvenile
38
39
40 loggerhead, green, and hawksbill turtles [16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. Combined, these findings suggest
41
42 that natal philopatry for marine turtles extends beyond mating and nesting adults, and that NFP is a
43
44 common strategy exhibited across life stages for a number of marine turtle species and stocks. NFP
45
46 has not been described in all species, e.g, leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), yet, the
47
48
49 pervasiveness of the NFP pattern is particularly notable given that it can manifest even in species and
50
51 populations known to experience a panmictic post-hatchling dispersal pattern (e.g., [16,20,33]).
52
53 Our findings suggest that eastern Pacific hawksbills may not conform to the commonly
54
55 postulated open-ocean dispersal theory in which post-hatchling turtles are believed to leave natal
56
57
areas via entrainment in offshore currents [7,33], which for hawksbills would be major ocean
58
59
60 currents of the eastern Pacific [35]. Instead, our findings support the hypothesis that hawksbills may

1
2 remain in coastal regions in the eastern Pacific during the post-hatchling phase, categorized by [34]
3
4 as a Type 1 hatchling developmental pattern. In contrast to marine turtle populations in other parts of
5
6
7
the world, hawksbills along Pacific Central America primarily nest at rookeries located within
8
9 inshore estuaries [36, 37] and these systems are strongly regulated by tidal fluctuations. Additionally,
10
11 hawksbills exhibit reduced swim gaits compared to other marine turtle species [38]. Recent research
12
13 of lobster gillnet fisheries that operate in neritic waters (i.e., < 1 km from shore) off Pacific Central
14
15
America has led to the documentation of various hawksbill measuring CCL =15 cm in size [39],
16
17
18 further supporting the Type 1 hatchling development model.
19
20 To date, the flatback turtle (Natator depressus) is the only species of marine turtle whose
21
22 hatchlings have been identified as potentially lacking a pelagic phase during early post-hatchling
23
24 development [40,7,34]. At present, data on fine-scale currents are not available for the coastal zones
25
26
27 of the eastern Pacific where hawksbills are found, which limits opportunities to conduct meaningful
28
29 particle modeling efforts. Future research combining particle modeling (e.g., [12,14]), tracking of
30
31 post-hatchlings (e.g.,[41]) and satellite telemetry of young life-stage (6-8 months old) juveniles (e.g.,
32
33 [15,33]), would help elucidate the post-hatchling movements of hawksbills in the eastern Pacific.
34
35
Although the NFP pattern is clearly observed in eastern Pacific hawksbills, what is not clear
36
37
38 is the role of potential mechanisms behind the NFP pattern in this and other species or stocks, which
39
40 could include oceanic currents, geomagnetic imprinting, visual and chemical cues, genetic memory,
41
42 habitat associations, learned migration behavior, and other factors [15,34,42,43,44]. Irrespective of
43
44 the mechanism, affinity to foraging grounds in proximity to rookeries would provide several selective
45
46
47 advantages, namely higher lifetime reproductive success from more frequent visits to rookeries [45],
48
49 as well as higher survival as the absence of large-scale migrations between rookeries and foraging
50
51 grounds would reduce some threat exposure [4,14,46]. Recent telemetry and nesting biology research
52
53 of female hawksbills in the eastern Pacific confirms relatively short post-nesting migrations or non-
54
55
migratory behavior altogether [25], as well as relatively common annual nesting intervals [47].
56
57
58 Our findings have important implications for life-history research and conservation of marine
59
60 turtles, particularly for hawksbills in the eastern Pacific. NFP may mean that addressing local threats
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos R. Soc. open sci.
Page 9 of 19 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
to foraging hawksbills has potentially greater conservation value for nearby rookeries and hence local
1
2 populations. Similarly, whereas the conservation of marine turtles can often require the collaboration
3
4 of governments from multiple nations over large ocean regions [46,48,49], NFP of hawksbills in the
5
6 eastern Pacific indicates that one or two neighboring nations may be able to protect the majority of
7
8
9 the life cycle of an entire stock or management unit. As NFP appears common among many marine
10
11 turtle species, focused research on the ubiquity of this dispersal pattern in individual populations is
12
13 needed to advance marine turtle ecology and to support effective conservation management
14
15 strategies. Similarly, NFP as a general life history concept merits specific discussion and inclusion in
16
17
current marine turtle and spatial ecology literature. Finally, further research into NFP for other wide
18
19
20 ranging aquatic species known to exhibit nesting philopatry, such as various salmonid and seabird
21
22 species (e.g., [50,51]), may also be warranted to support robust conservation planning.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a nice study which adds to the growing literature on the topic of juvenile natal
homing and natal foraging philopatry.
The paper should be published but with modification to the discussion. The data does not
support the absence of an oceanic stage and much of this section should be removed.
There is growing evidence that immature hawksbills are making long distance migrations
and this is a likely mechanism for this result. Both options can be discussed but there is
more evidence for the immature migration.
We appreciate the reviewers concern and we agree that we needed to revise our wording
in the discussion. We have modified discussion text in order to reflect the fact that our
data suggest a lack of a pelagic post-hatchling phase or a truncated pelagic phase for
hawksbills in the eastern Pacific. We have further clarified that previously published
research identifying novel life-history characteristics for the species in the region support
this hatchling development pattern. The evidence for no or a truncated pelagic phase
includes 1) the predominant use of inshore habitats (mangrove estuaries) that are strongly
influenced by tidal currents that could potentially entrain post-hatchlings close to coast
(of note: the inshore nesting of flatback turtles was recently found to be a primary
contributor to a lack of a pelagic post-hatchling phase in this species, as featured in a 24
May 2017 publication by RSOS), 2) extremely restricted movement behavior by tracked
juveniles and adults, and 3) the documentation of extremely small individuals (e.g., 14
cm) in near shore habitats by an ongoing coastal gillnet fisheries research project.

This is a nice study that I enjoyed reading. Throughout the writing and reporting of the
results is clear. I think this work will make a nice contribution. I have some relatively
minor suggestions that, with a little care, will be relatively easy for the authors to attend
to.
We appreciate the positive feedback
1. The authors talk about hatchling dispersal by ocean currents. It has been suggested that
hatchlings imprint on foraging sites they encounter while drifting. So if they do not drift
far from their natal beach, then their foraging sites will similarly be close to the natal
beaches. Furthermore, as part of this link between currents/foraging sites, another
suggestion, supported by empirical evidence, is that if hatchlings are dispersed to very
distant sites (>3000 km away), then this is too far for reproductive migrations to the natal
beach. So in those cases, individuals travel back closer to their natal beach to find a
foraging area and this means that they end up foraging close to their natal beach. See:
Scott R et al. (2014) Ontogeny of long distance migration. Ecology 95, 2840-2850. doi:
10.1890/13-2164.1 So these are two mechanisms that predict foraging sites will
sometimes be close to natal beaches. So it would be worth discussing these ideas
presented by Scott et al.
We appreciate the interest in understanding the mechanisms or process that underlies the
NFP pattern we detected, yet we feel identifying the potential mechanisms behind NFP is
beyond the scope of this manuscript. While we provide the reader with some plausible
potential mechanisms specifically for our study species and area (i.e., hawksbills in the
eastern Pacific), our primary goal is to present the data that support the NFP pattern and
solidify the NFP concept in support of future research that can directly explore
mechanisms.
2. Methods. I would briefly explain how you got your hands on the turtles. Caught by
rodeo ? Caught by fishermen ?
We have provided additional information to clarify how turtles were encountered in
the first line of the methods.
3. The size of turtles is measured (curve carapace length). So I would consider in the
results if the probability of a turtle coming from the local rookery is linked to carapace
length.
A lack of samples for certain size classes and regions made it impossible to conduct
mixed stock analysis of different size classes.
4. It wasn't clear to me that the supporting data was available, so I would clarify this
issue.
We have updated the Data Accessibility section of the manuscript.

- Size range of turtles in foraging areas: Without data on the size of turtles (beyond
the mean - p5, line 44) found in the foraging areas it is difficult to interpret if the
conclusions are appropriate. A histogram or something that displays the data
would be helpful.
We have added a figure with bins showing size distributions in 5cm increments (i.e.,
Figure 2)
- It seems to me that the implication that no pelagic stage exists, or that pelagic
stages aren’t as ubiquitous is overstated. For this study, it could be that juveniles
settle in neritic foraging grounds when they are 40 cm - and are pelagic before
that. Adult CCL is only ~68 so it is not so far off from adult stage. Additionally
the message in the paper seems to waffle - is the novelty that they don’t have a
pelagic stage (not supported, at least not with the CCL data provided) or that they
come back to natal foraging grounds when they are still in the juvenile stage
(which is seen in other areas already?). I ended up feeling confused about the
novelty of the study, at least as pitched.
This issue was also raised by Rev1 and we have addressed this issue by altering the text
to demonstrate that the evidence supports the possibility that a pelagic stage is lacking or
truncated.
Abstract
line 18: Our findings confirm << other studies refute >> that traditional views of natal
homing…
We feel that the wording “our findings confirm” best captures the meaning of this
sentence.
Introduction
p3, lines 11-16: I don’t know that this is true. Many species - leatherbacks, olive ridleys
to name two - forage in pelagic regions as adults. Even some species move between
pelagic and neritic zones as juveniles such as green turtles off of South America. This is a
broad generalization that does not seem accurate.
Our original text specifically states that “most” post-hatchling turtles spend a multi-year
period in open ocean gyres before recruiting to neritic foraging grounds. However, we
have added text to recognize that there are deviations from this pattern. However, the
open-ocean to neritic habitat dispersal pattern is the most widely recognized pattern for
the majority of marine turtles species and this is supported by numerous studies (see a
few example references in manuscript) and general marine turtle biology texts (e.g., The
Biology of Sea Turtles Vol. II).
p3, lines 22-23: I don’t personally see this as a ubiquitous pattern.
Although natal homing for adults is a highly ubiquitous pattern, we have removed the
sentence regarding ‘ubiquity’ in recognition of the different post-hatchling development
patterns that may exist for the taxon (discussed in the previous comment).
p3, lines 42-49: This seems overstated; there are 7 studies you cite that show otherwise. I
think the larger issue is that we don’t know much about most populations across species
across both hatchling or young adult stages. Additionally in the discussion you note that
in one of the Bio of Sea Turtles this actually even has a name (Type 1 hatchling
development pattern).
I believe the reviewer is confusing the a) Type 1 hatchling development pattern (turtles
developing entirely in near shore environments) mentioned in the Discussion, with the
pattern of b) juvenile turtles using foraging grounds in the vicinity of their natal areas
(i.e., juvenile philopatry to natal areas, which we term “natal foraging philopatry” in this
manuscript). These are two very different concepts and the latter has been poorly
explored or discussed as a potential broad sea turtle life-history paradigm. Elucidating
this fact is the primary objective of this manuscript. We have added text to these lines
(and other areas of the manuscript) to distinguish between these patterns and better
clarify the lack of attention to the latter concept.
Methods
Suggest changing terminology from simply ‘rookery’ to ‘nesting rookery’ - foraging
rookery is also common terminology and would aid the reader.
To clarify, the term “rookery” is specifically used to define a breeding colony or nesting
area, thus using the term “foraging rookery” is inappropriate and using “nesting rookery”
would be redundant. However, we have added “(i.e, nesting colony)” after the first use of
the term rookery to clarify.
p5, lines 31-33: how many individuals were removed?
We have added the number.
Results
See comment above about CCLs
As mentioned previously, we have added a graph with turtle measurement bins.
Figure 1 is very nicely done and corresponds well to the text.
We appreciate the positive feedback
Discussion
p6, lines 22-25: Please provide information on the size of the nesting rookeries.
We have added this information.
p6, lines 33-36: This seems like an obvious statement to me. More surprising would be if
it was for rookeries far from each other.
While it may seem intuitive, broad-scale studies showing such a predominant
contribution by rookeries to local foraging grounds, even when in close proximity (as
stated in the subsequent line), are rare. However, as we have highlighted in this
manuscript, it has been shown on a number of occasions, for species/populations with
confirmed panmictic hatchling dispersal (e.g., Bowen et al. 2004), as well for those for
which post-hatchling dispersal remains unknown (e.g., this study). Combined, these
findings indicate that some marine turtle species/populations use foraging areas near their
region of origin, a pattern we’ve termed natal foraging philopatry, which holds regardless
of the mechanism responsible for the pattern.
Also here it is important to know the number of individuals removed form the study for
unobserved haplotypes - and how many haplotypes were observed within the removed
group.
Only five samples (0.9%) exhibited orphan haplotoypes (four haplotypes total) and were
removed from the mixed stock analysis. We have added this information to the results.
These are likely rare haplotypes present in nesting populations (known or unknown) in
the eastern Pacific that have yet to be detected.
p6, lines 53-60: Hawksbills are know n to be coastal in many areas as juveniles
(Caribbean for example) - this doesn’t seem surprising to me.
We agree that there is strong evidence that hawksbills are found in coastal regions in the
Atlantic. That said, no studies have documented, or even suggested, a truncated or absent
hatchling or juvenile pelagic phase, thus we feel this represents a novel finding for the
species. Furthermore, in contrast to hawksbill in other oceans, the evidence that
hawksbills manifest this pattern is stronger in the eastern Pacific, where juveniles have
been documented to use inshore estuarine habitats and as being less vagile than
conspecifics in other oceans.
p7, lines 4-34: I don’t see how this section follows - seems a bit out of place and I don’t
follow and obvious line of thinking here. Of more interest would de what hawksbills do
in other parts of the world (e.g. the Caribbean where they are known to be
neurotic). Also, its difficult to say for certain but with your standard deviation, I am
guessing your foraging rookery turtles don’t get as small as 15 cm.
We have added text to clarify this section.
