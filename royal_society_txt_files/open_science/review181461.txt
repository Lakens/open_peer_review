Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The paper by Stimpson et al. provides important new historical baseline data on a Critically
Endangered but largely overlooked mammal species, with potentially important implications for
understanding its ecological requirements and thus informing future conservation management.
However, additional analysis and some restructuring of the manuscript is required before it can
be published.
Major comments:
- The introduction is all a bit too specific, and makes the paper feel like it would only appeal to
someone already interested in muntjacs. It would be much better to open the paper by framing
the study in a much wider context, by starting off with an explanation about the importance of
using data from the past (historical baselines, environmental archives) to provide new insights for
conservation of threatened species, and the ways in which this can be / has been done - i.e. make
the paper of interest to people beyond just muntjac specialists!
- Similarly, the previous suggestion that vuquangensis and gigas are the same species should be
introduced in the introduction, rather than this important point being relegated to the discussion
– as your study provides further evidence of a past wider distribution of giant muntjacs, which
supports the previous study.
- Similarly, the idea that the name “gigas” can be “ignored” for now, even though it represents a
senior synonym of vuquangensis, because “this revision has not yet been formally adopted”, is a
bit of a red herring – the way it can be adopted is by studies like this deciding to use the name
“gigas” (it doesn’t require a formal IUCN edict) – as there is no worldwide arbiter of taxonomy.
So, if the authors consider that vuquangensis and gigas are the same taxon, they should use the
name gigas in this manuscript; and if not, then they should state why they think they’re different.
- When comparing measurements between the new specimen and existing data for other
muntjacs, the authors should also compare their specimen with available measurement data for
Muntiacus gigas – this is really important to do.
- The lack of any statistical analysis to compare the new specimen with other muntjac samples
(muntiacus, vuquangensis, gigas) is a major omission, and really has to be done – even if just via
something fairly straightforward such as t-tests or ANOVAs. A statistical assessment of
measurement differences, rather than just “eyeballing” the data, is essential.
Minor comments:
- “sub-fossil” should be changed throughout the manuscript to “subfossil” (the more normal way
of spelling this word)
- “critically endangered” should be capitalised to “Critically Endangered”, as this is a formal
IUCN threat category. It also shouldn’t be written in inverted commas (line 58)
- Line 112: “11, 778” – spacing after the comma needs correcting
3
- Line 243: “ectosylids” spelled incorrectly
- Line 257: “Muntiacini” shouldn’t be italicised
- Line 263: “celaphodus” spelled incorrectly
- Line 285: not strictly true that the only confirmed gigas specimens derive from Holocene sites in
China - Turvey et al 2016 also included a Late Pleistocene specimen from Yuhang in their
analyses, so Pleistocene material has been interpreted by previous authors as representing gigas
- Line 352-3: even if lower elevational estimates are confounded by human activity, it would still
be useful to say what the current lower elevational range estimate is for the species, and how
much this differs from the elevation of the Holocene site from which the new specimen was
found - and also discuss the idea of the Annamites acting as an altitudinal refugium for the
species, in the context of this concept more widely for SE Asian and other mammal species

Dear authors,
This is a carefully conducted transdisciplinary study, a very well written manuscript, and an
excellent example that we need the big picture, far beyond historical time, when assessing
conservational needs. Congratulations, I've enjoyed reading very much!
I've only indicated minor suggestions to consider in the manuscript.
The two most important among them, I'm coming up with here again:
Critical data of Capreolus pygargus and Elaphodus cephalophus megalodon seem to have been
4
neglected. In order to make the issues more transparent I'd suggest to add relevant data.

The manuscript is well written and if the topic falls into the scope of the journal, it definitely is
worth to be published. Unfortunately I have not found any access to the supplementary tables
and figures. Therefore, I could not comment some of the evidence used in the ms. Substantial part
of the arguments is based on the body mass estimation. The method is recalled from Janis (1990).
Since the reference deals with a chapter from a book published almost 30 years ago, it may be
difficult for many readers to get and read the methodology there. This may have two implications
to the recent manuscript. First, the authors of the present study should describe in brief the
principles of the method for those readers who do not have the cited book at hand. Second, from
a more recent literature (e. g., Mendoza, M., Janis, C. M. & Palmqvist, P., 2006. Estimating the
body mass of extinct ungulates: a study on the use of multiple regression. J. Zool. 270, 90-101; De
Esteban-Trivigno, S. & Köhler, M., 2011. New equations for body mass estimation in bovids:
Testing some procedures when constructing regression functions. Mamm. Biol. 76, 755-761) it is
apparent that some improvements of the method are available since 1990. Even if it was not
applicable to the paleo-material available, it seems the body mass estimation based on multiple
regression should be considered more carefully.
Ad Table 1 – These are important measures. A sketch showing simply how the mandible was
measured would help.
Ad Figure 3 – Chinese water deer announced in the text (lines 196-198) is absent in the figure.

Appendix A
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
We thank the referees and editors for their time reviewing our submission “An 11,000-year-old
giant muntjac subfossil from Northern Vietnam: implications for past and present populations”.
The comments and suggested revisions improve the content of the revised manuscript and the
acknowledgements have been updated, accordingly. We are particularly grateful to Reviewer 1
for supplying details of the dental dimensions of Muntiacus gigas.
1. REVIEWER 1
The paper by Stimpson et al. provides important new historical baseline data on a Critically
Endangered but largely overlooked mammal species, with potentially important implications
for understanding its ecological requirements and thus informing future conservation
management. However, additional analysis and some restructuring of the manuscript is

The introduction is all a bit too specific, and makes the paper feel like it would only appeal to
someone already interested in muntjacs. It would be much better to open the paper by framing
the study in a much wider context, by starting off with an explanation about the importance of
using data from the past (historical baselines, environmental archives) to provide new
insights for conservation of threatened species, and the ways in which this can be / has been
done - i.e. make the paper of interest to people beyond just muntjac specialists!
Response
We agree with this comment and the study would benefit from being placed in a wider
research context. The introduction has been revised and expanded with the addition of the
following section:
PAGE 1 lines 44-59
“Human activities continue to reduce mammal populations, geographic ranges and, ultimately,
cause extinctions [1]. While the scale, rapidity and mechanisms driving recent anthropogenic
impacts such as these are unprecedented [2-3], attempts to form effective conservation
strategies are potentially hampered by a paucity of studies that consider biological communities
from millennial as well as ecological (typically less than 50 years) timescales [2,4-7]. Current
studies and recent data (less than 100 years) characterise animal communities and their habitats
only after, potentially, centuries or millennia of exploitation and modification by humans [7-
10]. In this sense, a historical amnesia results in a shifting baseline syndrome where ecosystems,
animal populations and their current geographic distribution are interpreted as ‘natural’ or
pristine, where they are in fact degraded [2,9,11]. This issue is likely to be particularly
problematic with rare, recently described and poorly-known mammals [7,11]. In this context,
the potential of Quaternary archaeological and palaeontological data to provide longer time-
scale perspectives and benchmark evidence for biological conservation is increasingly being
recognised and demonstrated [7,9-16]. Here, we present just such a line of evidence and
consider a poorly-known and Critically Endangered species of deer (Cervidae): the giant
muntjac.”
The bibliography has been updated accordingly, references 1-16.

1.2 Comment
Similarly, the previous suggestion that vuquangensis and gigas are the same species should
be introduced in the introduction, rather than this important point being relegated to the
discussion – as your study provides further evidence of a past wider distribution of giant
muntjacs, which supports the previous study.
Similarly, the idea that the name “gigas” can be “ignored” for now, even though it
represents a senior synonym of vuquangensis, because “this revision has not yet been
formally adopted”, is a bit of a red herring – the way it can be adopted is by studies like this
deciding to use the name “gigas” (it doesn’t require a formal IUCN edict) – as there is no
worldwide arbiter of taxonomy. So, if the authors consider that vuquangensis and gigas are
the same taxon, they should use the name gigas in this manuscript; and if not, then they
should state why they think they’re different.
Response
In light of the reviewer’s comments, it is clear that the taxonomic discussion of Muntiacus
vuquangensis/gigas requires clarification from the outset. We agree that, following the study
of Turvey et al. (2016), Muntiacus vuquangensis and Muntiacus gigas are synonyms, with M.
gigas taking precedence. The title, keywords, abstract and manuscript has been updated
accordingly and the taxonomic discussion moved to the introduction, as follows:
PAGE 2 lines 25-43.
Four years prior to the discovery and description of M. vuquangensis, however, Wei et al. [32]
described a novel (and at the time, thought to be extinct) large muntjac species, Muntiacus
gigas, based on examination of subfossil antlers from the Chinese Neolithic site of Hemudu in
the Yangtze delta, dated 6 to 7 ka (“ka” = thousands of years before present). Recent work by
Turvey et al. [7] on the morphometric characteristics of these specimens, with further samples
from several Chinese sites ranging in date from the Late Pleistocene to Holocene (figure 1;
sites 1-8), demonstrated that there are no morphological grounds to separate M. gigas
specimens from extant M. vuquangensis and that these taxa should be considered conspecific.
Given that the description of M. gigas predated the description of M. vuquangensis, the species
name of the former has priority [7]. We therefore adopt the use of M. gigas, which we consider
to be synonymous with M. vuquangensis.
1.3 Comment
When comparing measurements between the new specimen and existing data for other
muntjacs, the authors should also compare their specimen with available measurement data
for Muntiacus gigas – this is really important to do.
Response
We agree and we sort available comparative measurements for M. gigas before submission of
the manuscript and made renewed searches and appeals to colleagues following the reviewer’s
comments. We were successful in sourcing limited data for “M. vuquangensis” which as per
the discussion above, is regarded as the same species. The original description of M. gigas
fragmentary mandibles and maxilla are alluded to but no descriptions or measurements are
presented (Wei et al. 1990). Subsequent records also appear to have focused on the
identification and description of pedicles and antlers. To our knowledge there are no available
published dental data with a confirmed ID for M. gigas: we are therefore grateful to R1 for
supplying m2 and m3 length data for this taxon.
These data were incorporated as follows:

Lengths of the m2 and m3 (SLML = 12.58 mm and TLML = 16.71 mm, respectively) from a
specimen of M. gigas (T301-6) from Tianluoshan, near Hemudu (Turvey, personal
communication) also fall within the range of M. muntjak.
PAGE 7 lines 10-12
Comparison of m2 length (SLML) and m3 length (TLML) from the M. gigas specimen
indicated no significant difference between these measures and the normative sample of M.
muntjak.
PAGE 8 Lines 9-14
A comparison of Middle and Late Pleistocene m3 lengths from specimens attributed to “M.
muntjak” with data from extant M. muntjak (n = 32; this study, [41]) does suggest larger size in
the Pleistocene (figure 7): the difference in median values is statistically significant (Kruskal-
Wallace: Hc (tie-corrected) = 43.03; P = < 0.001). Conversely, comparison of median values
of Middle and Late Pleistocene records and M. gigas (n = 4; including HBC-27587) indicated
no significant difference (Kruskal-Wallace: Hc (tie-corrected) = 0.2468; P = 0.8839).

1.4 Comment
The lack of any statistical analysis to compare the new specimen with other muntjac samples
(muntiacus, vuquangensis, gigas) is a major omission, and really has to be done – even if just
via something fairly straightforward such as t-tests or ANOVAs. A statistical assessment of
measurement differences, rather than just “eyeballing” the data, is essential.
Response
We agree that the study would benefit from statistical testing of observations of metric data.
Given that the archaeological specimen is a single sample simple t-tests or ANOVA’s would
not be appropriate, given n = 1, we have used a normative comparisons approach (described
below) of a single case (dental metrics from the mandible) to a normative sample (metric data
sets from comparative taxa).
PAGE 3 lines 55-60 to PAGE 4 lines 3-11
The methodology has been updated accordingly:
Statistical tests were performed to compare dental metrics of comparative museum
specimens and published sources [41-43]. Comparison of dental metrics from the mandible,
and in cases where sample sizes of comparative data were small, testing followed the
procedures for normative comparisons [44-47], where metrics from a single case (e.g. HBC-
27587) are compared with a normative sample generated from comparative data to test for
differences from the estimated parameters of a given taxon (e.g. M. muntjak). Multivariate
normative comparisons (m2 and m3, lengths and widths or a subset of these data depending on
the availability of comparative data) were performed using a modified Hotelling’s T2 test,
following Huizenga et al. [46]. Univariate normative comparisons were also performed with a
modified t-test [44-45] with a step-down correction to control familywise false-positive error
rate in multiple comparisons [47]. These approaches assume univariate/multivariate normality
in the normative samples. Sample data sets were examined for departures from normality using
the functions in PAST 3.20. Normative comparisons were performed using the E-clip,

Revised manuscript RSOS-181461.R1 Stimpson et al. An 11,000-year-old giant muntjac
subfossil from Northern Vietnam: implications for past and present populations
The comparative section (3.2 Morphology and metrics - comparisons) has been revised in
the following areas:
PAGE 5 lines 47-50 (comparison with C. pygargus – see also response to comments from R2
“Capreolus”, below)
The m2 and m3 lengths of the archaeological specimen exceed those of small samples
of Holocene specimens from Primoye [43] but these differences are not significant (SLML: n
= 4; t = 1.117; P = 0.25, one-sided; TLML: n = 5; t = 1.291; P = 0.09, one-sided).
PAGE 6 lines 20-22 (comparison with E. cephalodus – see also response to comments from
R2 “Elaphodus”, below)
Comparison of m3 lengths and widths (TLML, TLMW) with a sample of extant E.
cephalophus (n = 9; this study, [42]) indicate that these dimensions are significantly larger in
the archaeological specimen (T2 = 26.498; P < 0.001; one-sided).
PAGE 6 lines 54-60 and PAGE 7 lines 3-25
The limited available measurements from larger-bodied Muntiacus spp., M. crinifrons
(n = 2) and M. feae (n = 2) fall within the upper range of M. muntjak. Multivariate normative
comparisons of m2 and m3 lengths and widths (SLML, SLMW, TLML, TLMW) of available
data from these species (n = 2, in both cases) with sample data from specimens of M. muntjak
from mainland Southeast Asia (n = 23) indicate no significant difference (table 3).
Available data from two specimens of “M. vuquangensis”, the young male (NHMUK
2010.484) (NHMUK 2010) and the 34 kg female (AMNH M-274588), indicate that
measurements from giant muntjac overlap with the upper range of M. muntjak (figure 5).
Lengths of the m2 and m3 (SLML = 12.58 mm and TLML = 16.71 mm, respectively) from a
specimen of M. gigas (T301-6) from Tianluoshan, near Hemudu (Turvey, personal
communication) also fall within the range of M. muntjak. Multivariate normative comparisons
of m2 and m3 lengths and widths (SLML, SLMW, TLML, TLMW) of the young male M.
vuquangensis with sample data from M. muntjak (n= 23) indicated no significant difference
(table 3). This test indicated that the metrics from Schaller’s female specimen are marginally,
but significantly, larger than the normative sample (table 3). Comparison of m2 length (SLML)
and m3 length (TLML) from the M. gigas specimen indicated no significant difference between
these measures and the normative sample of M. muntjak.
The dimensions of the m2 and m3 of HBC-27587 exceed all available comparative
data from species within the tribe (figure 5). Comparisons of m2 and m3 lengths and widths (n
= 23) and m3 lengths and widths (n = 32) of HBC-27587 indicate that these variables are
significantly larger in the archaeological specimen, than in the sample data for M. muntjak
(table 3). The body weight estimates derived from measurements of the mandible are also
consistent with the trend in dental metrics and suggest a larger animal than the majority of
Muntiacus spp. A mean estimate of approximately 40 kg for the specimen exceeds reported
weights ranges of all taxa within the tribe bar one: M. gigas (figure 6). While the dental
dimensions of the Hang Boi specimen exceed available comparative data, given the range of
variation within dental measurements in the genus (figure 5) there is no reason to suggest that
the archaeological specimen would be an excessively or anomalously large specimen for this
taxon. As such, there are no compelling grounds to posit a novel species and we refer specimen
HBC-27587 to M. gigas (syn. vuquangensis).

Minor comments:
- “sub-fossil” should be changed throughout the manuscript to “subfossil” (the more normal
way of spelling this word) Changed to “subfossil” throughout the manuscript
- “critically endangered” should be capitalised to “Critically Endangered”, as this is a
formal IUCN threat category. It also shouldn’t be written in inverted commas (line 58)
Changed to Critically Endangered, throughout.
- Line 112: “11, 778” – spacing after the comma needs correcting Corrected
- Line 243: “ectosylids” spelled incorrectly Corrected
- Line 257: “Muntiacini” shouldn’t be italicised Corrected
- Line 263: “celaphodus” spelled incorrectly Corrected
- Line 285: not strictly true that the only confirmed gigas specimens derive from Holocene
sites in China - Turvey et al 2016 also included a Late Pleistocene specimen from Yuhang in
their analyses, so Pleistocene material has been interpreted by previous authors as
representing gigas
Agreed, this statement in the original manuscript was not correct.

Figure 1 and caption have been revised to show Yuhang (site 8) as a Late Pleistocene site.
The following sections have also been revised:
PAGE 2 lines 29-31
Recent work by Turvey et al. [7] on the morphometric characteristics of these specimens,
with further samples from several Chinese sites ranging in date from the Late Pleistocene to
Holocene (figure 1; sites 1-8),
PAGE 7 lines 32-34
At present, however, the only confirmed giant muntjac fossils derive from one Late
Pleistocene site (Yuhang; figure 1; site 8) and a handful of Holocene archaeological sites in
China, collectively dating between 2.2 and 7 ka [7].
- Line 352-3: even if lower elevational estimates are confounded by human activity, it would
still be useful to say what the current lower elevational range estimate is for the species, and
how much this differs from the elevation of the Holocene site from which the new specimen
was found - and also discuss the idea of the Annamites acting as an altitudinal refugium for
the species, in the context of this concept more widely for SE Asian and other mammal species
This section is revised and expanded:
PAGE 8 lines 36-43
The species has been recorded up to 1200 m above sea level (asl) but available data suggests
the species is most likely to occur below 1000 m asl. Reliable estimates of lower elevational
limits, however, are confounded by recent trends in habitat removal and over-hunting [31].
The Tràng An karst rarely approaches 200 m asl and the coastal plain that surrounds the
massif, and dolines within it, are only a few meters above sea level. The specimen from Hang
Boi indicates that giant muntjac occurred in a lowland karst setting and, as such, the current
altitudinal range of the giant muntjac in the Annamites may not represent an ecological
preference for habitats at higher altitudes, but rather a response to human activities.
REVIEWER 2
Dear authors,
this is a carefully conducted transdisciplinary study, a very well written manuscript, and an
excellent example that we need the big picture, far beyond historical time, when assessing
conservational needs. Congratulations, I've enjoyed reading very much! I've only indicated
minor suggestions to consider in the manuscript. The two most important among them, I'm
coming up with here again:
2.1 Comment
Critical data of Capreolus pygargus and Elaphodus cephalophus megalodon seem to have
been neglected. In order to make the issues more transparent I'd suggest to add relevant data.
Response
Data have been added to the treatment of Elaphodus and Capreolus and these sections have
been revised as per the reviewer’s comments:
Capreolus:
PAGE 5 lines 39-60 and PAGE 6 Lines 3-4
While extant populations of Siberian roe deer, Capreolus pygargus, have a largely
temperate distribution and currently range only as far south as Eastern Tibet and central Chinese
provinces [57], these are mid-sized cervids (32-48 kg [58]) with similar tooth dimensions and
6
Revised manuscript RSOS-181461.R1 Stimpson et al. An 11,000-year-old giant muntjac
subfossil from Northern Vietnam: implications for past and present populations
simple occlusal morphology. Average measurements of m2 lengths and widths (SLML,
SLMW) from late Pleistocene samples of “C. manchuricus”, regarded to be synonymous with
C. pygargus, from Jilin Province, Northeast China [59] and reference data (NHMUK 83.324)
suggest similar dimensions to HBC-27587 (figure 5). Lengths and widths of the third molar are
smaller than the archaeological specimen and fall into the upper size range of equivalent data
for M. muntjak (figure 5). The m2 and m3 lengths of the archaeological specimen exceed those
of small samples of Holocene specimens from Primoye [43] but these differences are not
significant (SLML: n = 4; t = 1.117; P = 0.25, one-sided; TLML: n = 5; t = 1.291; P = 0.09,
one-sided).
Morphologically, the concavity of the posterior margin of the mandibular ramus
appears shallower but much wider (i.e extends much further dorsally to the condyle) in
Capreolus than is suggested in the archaeological specimen. C. pygargus lacks anterior
cingulids, as is the case with the archaeological specimen, but protoconids and hypoconids are
much more angular and there is marked overlap of the metaconids and entoconids. Ectostylids
are present on the lower molars, though are weakly developed, particularly on the m3, in
comparison to HBC-27587 (figure 3).
The genus Capreolus is associated with temperature climates at higher latitudes both
in terms of extant populations and the wider fossil record in Eurasia [60]. In Pleistocene records
of East Asia, C. pygargus does not appear as a component of the Ailuropoda-Stegodon fauna
[61] and Holocene records (archaeological and historical, n = 51) are restricted to central and
northern provinces in China, with no records of the species further south than Hubei [11]. As
such, C. pygargus can also be reasonably discounted on biostratigraphic and as well as
ecological grounds (see section 4.2).
Limited available data from Capreolus pygargus is also included in figure 5 and occlusal
morphology of the m2 and m3 in now shown in figure 3.
Elaphodus:
PAGE 6 lines 12-22
The tufted deer, Elaphodus cephalophus, is currently restricted to southern China
(with historical records from eastern Myanmar). These deer are associated with montane forest
habitats and apparently do not range into sub-tropical environments [63]. Hooijer [62] describes
a larger, Pleistocene subspecies, E. cephalophus megalodon, from Yanjinggou in China.
Metrics of individual teeth are not reported, but an upper M1 to M3 length of 410 mm suggest
tooth dimensions may be similar to, if not exceeding those of larger Muntiacus spp. [cf. 25].
This taxon, however, is known only from early Middle Pleistocene sites in China [64].
Conversely, reported body weight ranges (17 – 30 kg; figure 6) and metrics of the m2 and m3
(figure 5) indicate that extant Elaphodus are relatively small in comparison to equivalent data
from the archaeological specimen. Comparison of m3 lengths and widths (TLML, TLMW) with
a sample of extant E. cephalophus (n = 9; this study, [42]) indicate that these dimensions are
significantly larger in the archaeological specimen (T2 = 26.498; P < 0.001; one-sided).

Comment “I'd recommend to specify more here and say "in medium wear" as the state of wear
is significant for the interspecific occlusal outline.”
Agreed, wear stage is critical here and was dealt with in rather vague terms in the original
manuscript. Here
wear stage is standardised and described, following:

scale with specimen HBC-27587. All specimens are equivalent to individual dental age stages
(IDAS) late stage 3/stage 4 [40].
The methodology is updated (PAGE 3 lines 53-54)
Wherever possible, reference specimens with equivalent individual dental age stages (IDAS)
[40] to the archaeological specimen (IDAS 3 to 4) were prioritised for morphological
comparisons of the dentition.
Comment “What do you mean with "molars appear rounded"? The occlusal outline (what were
not less rounded at the same level, when wear were less)? I'd suggest to rethink, if this part of
the sentence makes sense.”
Agreed, this sentence is not clear and is redundant given the proceeding description. Deleted:
“Wear to the occlusal surfaces is marked and the molars appear rounded.”

This issue was also flagged by R3 and was not clear in the original manuscript.
Figure 3 is now updated to include illustration of Hydropotes occlusal surface – anterior
cingulids (“goat folds”) are annotated. The term “goat folds” is dropped and the formal
terminology (anterior cingulids) is used:

Muntiacus.
See response “Capreolus”, above. We have included Capreolus pygargus in figure 3,

corrected to “This is likely to be a complex issue to address at present and a matter of

Comment “find this sentence hard to understand, perhaps separating into two sentences
would help.”
This section has been revised and clarified. Please also note that on review, the original “M.
munjak” data set, erroneously contained data from M. feae and M. crinifrons. While it is
unlikely that these small samples had a significant impact on the characteristics of the
distribution of measurements (as discussed in the manuscript in the morphometric description
of these species), it was not appropriate to include them and the Kruskal-Wallace tests were
re-run. The changes to the outcome of these tests were marginal and subsequent interpretation
was not affected. Furthermore, the data point for m3 length for M. gigas (kindly supplied by
R1) was grouped with m3 lengths of M. vuquangensis (synonymous) and HBC-27587 (the
archaeological mandible) as a sample for M. gigas, to compare with the Middle and Late
Pleistocene data sets.
PAGE 8 lines 9-19
A comparison of Middle and Late Pleistocene m3 lengths from specimens attributed
to “M. muntjak” with data from extant M. muntjak (n = 32; this study, [41]) does suggest larger
size in the Pleistocene (figure 7): the difference in median values is statistically significant
(Kruskal-Wallace: Hc (tie-corrected) = 43.03; P = < 0.001). Conversely, comparison of median
values of Middle and Late Pleistocene records and M. gigas (n = 4; including HBC-27587)
indicated no significant difference (Kruskal-Wallace: Hc (tie-corrected) = 0.2468; P = 0.8839).
In the Pleistocene data sets, m3 length does not appear to vary as a function of time
between Middle and Late Pleistocene (Mann Whitney U = 702; P = 0.7373), although sample
sizes are uneven (Late Pleistocene: n = 99; Middle Pleistocene: n = 15). Median values also
do not appear to differ as a function of latitude (Late Pleistocene Vietnam, n = 30; Late
Pleistocene China, n = 69; Mann Whitney U = 786; p = 0.0597).

COMMENTS ON FIGURE 2
“is that meters above sea level?”
“this figure shows less layers than given in Figure S1. Specification is needed.”
Figure 2 shows the upper 2 m of the stratigraphic section and heights relative to an arbitrary
site datum (set at 500 m) rather than sea level. This issues are clarified in revised figure

REVIEWER 3
The manuscript is well written and if the topic falls into the scope of the journal, it definitely
is worth to be published.
3.1 Comment
Unfortunately I have not found any access to the supplementary tables and figures. Therefore,
I could not comment some of the evidence used in the ms.
Response
We regret that the R3 could not gain access to the supplementary information, as we feel the
contents address several of the reviewer’s comments, below:
3.2 Comment
Substantial part of the arguments is based on the body mass estimation. The method is
recalled from Janis (1990). Since the reference deals with a chapter from a book published
almost 30 years ago, it may be difficult for many readers to get and read the methodology
there. This may have two implications to the recent manuscript. First, the authors of the
present study should describe in brief the principles of the method for those readers who do
not have the cited book at hand.
Response
In light of the reviewer’s methodological concerns that potential readers may not have access
to the source material (Janis, 1990) and for the sake of transparency, the parameters of the
regression equations and output (which were originally included in the in Supplementary
Materials as table S2) have been included as table 2 in the revised manuscript. The
methodology section is also revised:
PAGE 3 lines 43-47 Body mass estimates were derived from six measurements of the
specimen, following the least squares regression equations and percentage standard errors of
estimate (%SEE) for the Cervidae of Janis [39; table 2].
3.3 Comment
Second, from a more recent literature (e. g., Mendoza, M., Janis, C. M. & Palmqvist, P.,
2006. Estimating the body mass of extinct ungulates: a study on the use of multiple
regression. J. Zool. 270, 90-101; De Esteban-Trivigno, S. & Köhler, M., 2011. New equations
for body mass estimation in bovids: Testing some procedures when constructing regression
functions. Mamm. Biol. 76, 755-761) it is apparent that some improvements of the method are
available since 1990. Even if it was not applicable to the paleo-material available, it seems
the body mass estimation based on multiple regression should be considered more carefully.
Response
While the methods, above, present refined means of estimating body mass, they are either
practically (deal with characters or character sets not available to this study) or taxonomically
(Bovidae, not Cervidae) inappropriate. To our knowledge, the equations of Janis (1990)
remain the most comprehensive and robust treatment of body mass estimations for Cervidae
(see also Suraprasit et al., 2016).

3.4 Comment
Ad Table 1 – These are important measures. A sketch showing simply how the mandible was
measured would help.
Response
A figure showing these measurements was (and is) included in the Supplementary
Information as figure S1.
3.5 Comment
Ad Figure 3 – Chinese water deer announced in the text (lines 196-198) is absent in the
figure.
Response
Hydropotes now shown in figure 3 (see also response to R2 comments, above)
ANNOTATED PDF - COMMENTS ON SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Table S1
Figure 2 says “5105”?
Correct. As discussed in section 2.2 of the manuscript (PAGE 3 lines 17-18): “The mandible
was recovered in the western half of a 1 m x 1 m grid square (226/109) in a 10cm unit of
excavation (5010) through context (5105)”. Table S1 gives the excavation unit 5010 (within
which the charcoal sample was recovered) rather than the context (5105): this is corrected to
5105 in the table, for clarity.
Comment. “Why not using here the same abbreviations as for Table S2 and Figure S1?
Otherwise you have to explain that L and M are equal with SLML, SLMW, TLML, and
TLMW”
Revised:
Column headings changed from “m2 L”, “m2 W”, “m3 L” and “m3 W” to “SLML”,
“SLMW”, “TLML” and “TLMW”, respectively.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have done a great job in addressing all of my comments and suggestions, and
this is a great paper - I look forward to it being published! The only very minor further edits
that I'd suggest are a few typos here and there:
- Page 3, lines 56-58: It feels like there's a word missing from this sentence - maybe it needs a
"For" at the start of the sentence? Amended to “For comparison”
- Page 5, line 47: should "Primoye" be "Primorye"? Corrected to “Primorye”
- Page 5, line 57: "temperature" should be "temperate" Corrected to “temperate”
- Page 6, line 4: remove "and" after "biostratigraphic" Deleted: “and”
- Page 6, line 50: should "(NHMUK 2010)" be removed? (not sure what this means after the
actual reported specimen number) Correct, this is a typo. Deleted: “(NHMUK 2010)”
- Page 7, line 49: remove "of" from before "are present in Quaternary archives". Deleted:
“of”
- Page 8, line 3: remove "of" after "published metric identifications". Deleted: “of”
- Page 8, line 6: "post glacial" is usually either hyphenated or one word. Amended to: “post-
glacial”
- Figure 3: "Hydropotes" is spelled wrong in the figure, and "Capreolus (capreolus)
pygargus" should have the subgenus name in parentheses removed (since it's incorrectly
capitalised, and you don't refer to this subgenus name in the main text). Agreed, many thanks
for spotting these errors. Figure 3 has been amended: Hydropetes corrected to “Hydropotes”.
The caption for Capreolus revised to “Capreolus pygargus”.
