Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The paper by Balisi et al. asks a very interesting question about whether dietary specialization is
correlated with longer species durations in fossil canids. They argue that they do find a
relationship between specialization and duration, but that it is nuanced. Both hyper and hypo
carnivores show reduced durations relative to meso-carnivores. They do not find a relationship
between geographic range size and duration, or body size and duration once phylogeny is taken
into account. They find that drift, which they interpret as a Cope’s rule pattern is the best
explanation for the evolution of body mass. Dietary evolution does not show strong evidence for
one model versus another in this group.
Overall, I think that this is a well written paper addressing an interesting question. I found the
methods to be appropriate. My biggest issue with the paper is one that will crop up whenever we
start using terms like specialist and generalist. The argument in the paper hangs on the definition
of meso-carnivores as generalists. However, based on the information they provide in the paper, I
don’t agree that they make a case for that definition. Meso-carnivores are intermediate in both
body size and their degree of carnivory, how does that make them a generalist? Hypo-carnivores
have a much more varied diet. Why are they interpreted to be specialists? If the idea is that a
generalist is able to have a longer duration because they can take advantage of more different
kinds of resources, then hypo-carnivores are more generalist and their argument falls apart.
Either the authors need to better justify their categorizations of generalist to specialist, or (my
preference) reframe their question around different levels or the continuum of carnivory and
body size and better explain/justify their predictions.
I do think that the results are interesting and robust, it is just the framing of the question and
discussion that is problematic.
The other issue I had with the paper is the presentation of some of the figures. Figure 1, in
particular, is really hard to read. The choice of symbols for the extinct species makes it extremely
difficult to figure out which points go with which groups with staring at it for a while. Consider
something other than open up/down triangles. In addition to labeling your PC access include an
additional bit of information with an arrow on the x-axis indicating increased carnivory. On the
y-axis indicate the durophagy axis. Somewhere in the paper you indicate that jaw shape is also
important. Including images of the range and direction of change in jaw shape would be helpful.
I did not find Fig. 3 to be very useful. It also was difficult to read and required staring at it for a
long time to figure out what it meant. In this case, it may just be the angle. Try rotating the
images to see if it helps. If it doesn’t, consider multiple bivariate plots with shading for duration
similar to fig. S4.
I had a number of minor comments that I will list in order in which I encountered them in the
manuscript.
Line 25: You make a prediction about geographic range size and duration in the abstract, but
don’t include that result in your abstract.
Line 59: How large? Give an example.
Line 64: hypocarnivory involves eating lots of different things. How is that a specialization?
3
Line 69: negative does not equal no statistical association. fix language.
Line 85: What is generalist about being medium-sized?
Also line 85: Isn’t hypocarnivory more akin to being generalized? So why do you predict
optimum with meso carnivory?
Line 120: more information on how you predicted numerical values please.
Line 134: How did you handle overlap in the databases?
Line 144: Why are there only 92 in your supplementary dataset?
Line 173: include your R code in the supplementals.
Line 189: you refer to figure 2 before figure 1. You never refer to fig. s3 n the main text.
Line 238: put carnivory on your axes. Define durophagous here.
Line 240: remind us here what RUGA tells us.
Line 242: consider putting images of this on the graph in the appropriate places to illustrate this
point.
Line 302: Tables 3 and 4 have somewhat contradictory results. Table3 says a model with all three
variables is far and away the best model. Table 4 says only BM and carnivory are significant.
Line 314, 320: should be S3
Line 347: I disagree with this definition of specialization.
Line 371: What is species success in a modern ecosystem? Aren’t many of the traits you list
actually ways we define success, not things that correlate with it?
Line 376: but now you seem to be defining extinction risk as “success”. However, extinction risk
in modern systems is highly dependent on human impacts and cannot be used as similar to
extinction risk and success in pre-human ecosystems.
Line 420-422: I strongly disagree with this characterization of your results. hypocarnivores have
the most generalized diets.
Lines 419-433: Consider switching the order of your concluding paragraphs.
Line 603: I don’t think you ever use this reference.
Figure 3: there is no red line.
Figure 5: This figure is almost exactly the same as S3 in the supplement. I’m not sure you need
both.
Figure S3 and S4: You never refer to S3 in the main text. Where you refer to S4, I think you mean
S3. If so, then you never refer to S4 in the text.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
First, I would like to applaud the authors for this interesting study of canid ecology and evolution
using phylogenetic methods. I am happy to see the integration of fossil and extant taxa used to
investigate the full diversity of a lineage, rather than relying on extant taxa alone. The finding of
“a non-linear relationship between species duration and degree of carnivory: species at either end
of the carnivory spectrum tend to have shorter durations than mesocarnivores” is an exciting one.
I think this should be published following major revisions, mostly in the form of re-writing to
hone in on key ecological concepts and hypotheses, and to include map figures.
Overall, I think the dataset and analyses are sound, though not particularly novel, and the paper
feels as though it is not fully settled on the hypotheses it is testing – more descriptive of the canid
patterns. The morphological metrics chosen are appropriate and the inclusion of fossil and extant
taxa is important. The phylogenetic analyses are basic, but ok if interpreted in a narrower scope.
However, the conceptual framework and conclusions the authors draw from this limited dataset
require more attention and refining, particularly regarding sweeping use of major ecological
concepts. Resilience and ‘generalism’ are concepts in ecology with specific definitions, and
require attention to nuance, a discussion of niche, and reflection on how these topics have been
addressed in the empirical literature. For example, blanket statements such as “Because
generalization enables species to widen resource use and withstand disturbance (line 19)” are
made with significant assumptions and not well cited, particularly in literature that is outside of
paleontology or canids. Again, it would be very helpful if the authors used examples and
citations from ecology literature, given their use of these concepts in framing the paleontological
dataset.
I feel that the ecological conclusions the authors draw from these data are unsupported by the
data; however, I do feel that the data provide conclusions of smaller scope that are certainly
publication worthy. I recommend reframing hypotheses as using the paleontological record of
this lineage to test an ecological question, with specific hypotheses linked to a more tightly
defined concept of dietary generalism. These issues pervade both the introduction and
5
discussion. I recommend major revisions with extensive re-writing/framing, as I think it will
help the dataset be better appreciated by diverse audiences, especially given its listing in
“Ecology”. I have some minor concerns about a few methods, particularly regarding range size.
For a title, I would suggest a softer implication of dietary specialization for species durations,
such as “linked to” rather than “leads to”.
Use of the term resilience
The authors begin their abstract with the phrase “species resilience”. However, in ecology, this
term is associated with system-level responses to perturbations, and measuring the system’s
return to the pre-disturbance state. Therefore, there is a misapplication of an ecological concept
for this paleontological context.
Further, this concept is only used again once in the Discussion, line 357, as
“This poor preservation may itself suggest reduced resilience conferred by hypocarnivorous
specialization.” This is a misapplication of an important ecological concept. If this paper is geared
towards ecologists, they may be confused.
Use of the term success
This may be a personal bias, but I generally think of ‘success’ in the fossil record in the context of
lineage success, eg diversification. Further, I would not agree with the statement on line 38 that
“In extant mammals, abundance, range size, and population size are all measures of success.”
That statement implies that all r-selected species are somehow inherently better than k-selected
species. A more nuanced approach to this idea of “success” would be beneficial in reaching a
wide audience.
Does a species really need to have a wide range to be “successful”?
Given the mention of “traits” and “success” early on in the paper, I questioned why there were
no analyses looking at diversification, rate shifts, or ancestral state reconstructions –more
complex phylogenetic analyses.
Dietary specialization vs. generalism
It could be helpful to the reader if you spend a few sentences defining how you are applying
generalism to diet. You’ve mentioned ‘widening resource use’ but don’t address how this affects
your continuum of hypercarnivory, hypocarnivory, and mesocarnivory. There also appears to be
an assumed link between generalism and body size, but it might be that the hypocarnivores are
the most generalist in diet (omnivores like black bears) despite being larger than something like a
fox. How do you define resource or niche breadth in this context? What is the body of literature
from stable isotopes and scat analysis for extant carnivores? What axes of the Hutchinsonian
niche are considered here?
Body size and extinction
The mammal literature does document strong patterns of body size and extinction risk for
modern species. This predisposition to extinction, if not accounted for, could bias interpretations
of duration and thus ‘success’. Was an analysis of body size and extinction risk carried out in
your study? (Apologies if I missed this in supplement).
Remove in prep citations
The in prep citations are not appropriate, as the reader cannot follow up on these claims and
there is no guarantee they will be published in an accessible place. Could a completed PhD thesis
be cited instead?
6
Phylogeny requires more details
A key issue of this paper is the ambiguity regarding the phylogeny used, despite being listed as a
comparative methods paper. The authors refer only once to using a phylogeny produced by
Slater (2015), and accessing these details from the journal PNAS actually means crossing a
paywall, thereby not being open access! It would be helpful to briefly summarize the context of
this phylogeny, including the type of phylogenic methods used (Bayesian?). Does it use both
genetic and morphological data? Does it provide full coverage of all species you include? It is
particularly important to note that Slater (2015) uses a fossil tip-dating approach, which is an
asset to your study. Do your species temporal ranges align with those used in Slater’s phylogeny?
It could also be helpful to provide a text file of your pruned version of this phylogeny with
branch lengths as supplemental material, for those looking to replicate your results.
A phylogeny figure highlighting the species included in the study and their temporal duration
could also be very, very helpful to the reader!
Geographic range & biases in associated methods
The time slices discussed in the methods/results would be important to display for the reader to
assess patterns and for replication of the study, yet are not in the main document nor
supplemental. The authors refer to work in progress, but if this paper is published right now,
there is no way to access these data. They should be included and would be helpful for the
reader.
The authors may introduce a bias in their mapping methods in which they “chose the time slice
with the highest occupancy to represent maximum locality coverage for that species”. If you are
by default choosing the highest occupancy slice, are you not biasing your understanding of how
the species responds to change? Might instead you consider a metric of variance through time
that better reflects range stability?
The authors also miss an opportunity to assess the impact of congener competition in this map
dataset, which could be calculated as range overlap across time slices for species. This may have
bounded the ranges of carnivores (especially young radiating lineages or smaller-bodied
lineages), thus biasing the proposed link between geographic range, ‘generalism’, and duration.
This point should be addressed.
The authors also do not include the potential environmental constraints on range (eg, ice sheets,
sea level) that could again bias their use of range in a ‘generalist’ context, given the long temporal
duration of the study. Were all lineages equally exposed to climatic perturbations?
The authors discuss range size indicating the ability to cope with a wide range of environmental
conditions. This could actually be calculated and verified for species that persist ~120,000 years to
present using WorldClim datasets rescaled to the grids similar to their ‘time slices’, with variance
in bioclimatic values calculated across the full species range. Is there any insight from modern
wide-ranging canids on this?
Line notes/suggestions
17: ‘long timescales’. Replace with a specific time scale since you have this available.
19: ‘because generalization enables species to widen resource use and withstand disturbance’. Or
is it that wide resource use is what makes a generalist? Are all generalists better at withstanding
all types of disturbances?
65: ‘ecological specialization on taxon success’. Again, a lot of non-operationalized ecology and
evolution terms here.
7
79: ‘ecological specialization on taxon success.We expect that generalized species of average size
and mesocarnivorous diet will tend to survive longer and have broader distributions than more
specialized species simply because their flexibility allows them to better survive times of
disturbance and exist over a wider range of environmental conditions.’ There are a tremendous
number of assumptions in this sentence and no citations for these claims.
85: ‘Lastly, if generalization were advantageous, then medium size’ Is generalism always
associated with medium body size? Is this modal body size of the clade or of the mammal
community the species is found in?
216: ‘BM is the null phylogenetic model; only shared ancestry influences trait evolution’ This isn’t
quite accurate, it is a random walk with no consistent trends, and change is independent of past
character states.
Best of luck with these revisions, and I look forward to seeing a published version of this
manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
First, I would like to applaud the authors for this interesting study of canid ecology and evolution
using phylogenetic methods. I am happy to see the integration of fossil and extant taxa used to
investigate the full diversity of a lineage, rather than relying on extant taxa alone. The finding of
“a non-linear relationship between species duration and degree of carnivory: species at either end
of the carnivory spectrum tend to have shorter durations than mesocarnivores” is an exciting one.
I think this should be published following major revisions, mostly in the form of re-writing to
hone in on key ecological concepts and hypotheses, and to include map figures.
Overall, I think the dataset and analyses are sound, though not particularly novel, and the paper
feels as though it is not fully settled on the hypotheses it is testing – more descriptive of the canid
patterns. The morphological metrics chosen are appropriate and the inclusion of fossil and extant
taxa is important. The phylogenetic analyses are basic, but ok if interpreted in a narrower scope.
However, the conceptual framework and conclusions the authors draw from this limited dataset
require more attention and refining, particularly regarding sweeping use of major ecological
concepts. Resilience and ‘generalism’ are concepts in ecology with specific definitions, and
require attention to nuance, a discussion of niche, and reflection on how these topics have been
addressed in the empirical literature. For example, blanket statements such as “Because
generalization enables species to widen resource use and withstand disturbance (line 19)” are
made with significant assumptions and not well cited, particularly in literature that is outside of
12
paleontology or canids. Again, it would be very helpful if the authors used examples and
citations from ecology literature, given their use of these concepts in framing the paleontological
dataset.
I feel that the ecological conclusions the authors draw from these data are unsupported by the
data; however, I do feel that the data provide conclusions of smaller scope that are certainly
publication worthy. I recommend reframing hypotheses as using the paleontological record of
this lineage to test an ecological question, with specific hypotheses linked to a more tightly
defined concept of dietary generalism. These issues pervade both the introduction and
discussion. I recommend major revisions with extensive re-writing/framing, as I think it will
help the dataset be better appreciated by diverse audiences, especially given its listing in
“Ecology”. I have some minor concerns about a few methods, particularly regarding range size.
For a title, I would suggest a softer implication of dietary specialization for species durations,
such as “linked to” rather than “leads to”.
Use of the term resilience
The authors begin their abstract with the phrase “species resilience”. However, in ecology, this
term is associated with system-level responses to perturbations, and measuring the system’s
return to the pre-disturbance state. Therefore, there is a misapplication of an ecological concept
for this paleontological context.
Further, this concept is only used again once in the Discussion, line 357, as
“This poor preservation may itself suggest reduced resilience conferred by hypocarnivorous
specialization.” This is a misapplication of an important ecological concept. If this paper is geared
towards ecologists, they may be confused.
Use of the term success
This may be a personal bias, but I generally think of ‘success’ in the fossil record in the context of
lineage success, eg diversification. Further, I would not agree with the statement on line 38 that
“In extant mammals, abundance, range size, and population size are all measures of success.”
That statement implies that all r-selected species are somehow inherently better than k-selected
species. A more nuanced approach to this idea of “success” would be beneficial in reaching a
wide audience.
Does a species really need to have a wide range to be “successful”?
Given the mention of “traits” and “success” early on in the paper, I questioned why there were
no analyses looking at diversification, rate shifts, or ancestral state reconstructions –more
complex phylogenetic analyses.
Dietary specialization vs. generalism
It could be helpful to the reader if you spend a few sentences defining how you are applying
generalism to diet. You’ve mentioned ‘widening resource use’ but don’t address how this affects
your continuum of hypercarnivory, hypocarnivory, and mesocarnivory. There also appears to be
an assumed link between generalism and body size, but it might be that the hypocarnivores are
the most generalist in diet (omnivores like black bears) despite being larger than something like a
fox. How do you define resource or niche breadth in this context? What is the body of literature
from stable isotopes and scat analysis for extant carnivores? What axes of the Hutchinsonian
niche are considered here?
Body size and extinction
13
The mammal literature does document strong patterns of body size and extinction risk for
modern species. This predisposition to extinction, if not accounted for, could bias interpretations
of duration and thus ‘success’. Was an analysis of body size and extinction risk carried out in
your study? (Apologies if I missed this in supplement).
Remove in prep citations
The in prep citations are not appropriate, as the reader cannot follow up on these claims and
there is no guarantee they will be published in an accessible place. Could a completed PhD thesis
be cited instead?
Phylogeny requires more details
A key issue of this paper is the ambiguity regarding the phylogeny used, despite being listed as a
comparative methods paper. The authors refer only once to using a phylogeny produced by
Slater (2015), and accessing these details from the journal PNAS actually means crossing a
paywall, thereby not being open access! It would be helpful to briefly summarize the context of
this phylogeny, including the type of phylogenic methods used (Bayesian?). Does it use both
genetic and morphological data? Does it provide full coverage of all species you include? It is
particularly important to note that Slater (2015) uses a fossil tip-dating approach, which is an
asset to your study. Do your species temporal ranges align with those used in Slater’s phylogeny?
It could also be helpful to provide a text file of your pruned version of this phylogeny with
branch lengths as supplemental material, for those looking to replicate your results.
A phylogeny figure highlighting the species included in the study and their temporal duration
could also be very, very helpful to the reader!
Geographic range & biases in associated methods
The time slices discussed in the methods/results would be important to display for the reader to
assess patterns and for replication of the study, yet are not in the main document nor
supplemental. The authors refer to work in progress, but if this paper is published right now,
there is no way to access these data. They should be included and would be helpful for the
reader.
The authors may introduce a bias in their mapping methods in which they “chose the time slice
with the highest occupancy to represent maximum locality coverage for that species”. If you are
by default choosing the highest occupancy slice, are you not biasing your understanding of how
the species responds to change? Might instead you consider a metric of variance through time
that better reflects range stability?
The authors also miss an opportunity to assess the impact of congener competition in this map
dataset, which could be calculated as range overlap across time slices for species. This may have
bounded the ranges of carnivores (especially young radiating lineages or smaller-bodied
lineages), thus biasing the proposed link between geographic range, ‘generalism’, and duration.
This point should be addressed.
The authors also do not include the potential environmental constraints on range (eg, ice sheets,
sea level) that could again bias their use of range in a ‘generalist’ context, given the long temporal
duration of the study. Were all lineages equally exposed to climatic perturbations?
The authors discuss range size indicating the ability to cope with a wide range of environmental
conditions. This could actually be calculated and verified for species that persist ~120,000 years to
present using WorldClim datasets rescaled to the grids similar to their ‘time slices’, with variance
14
in bioclimatic values calculated across the full species range. Is there any insight from modern
wide-ranging canids on this?
Line notes/suggestions
17: ‘long timescales’. Replace with a specific time scale since you have this available.
19: ‘because generalization enables species to widen resource use and withstand disturbance’. Or
is it that wide resource use is what makes a generalist? Are all generalists better at withstanding
all types of disturbances?
65: ‘ecological specialization on taxon success’. Again, a lot of non-operationalized ecology and
evolution terms here.
79: ‘ecological specialization on taxon success.We expect that generalized species of average size
and mesocarnivorous diet will tend to survive longer and have broader distributions than more
specialized species simply because their flexibility allows them to better survive times of
disturbance and exist over a wider range of environmental conditions.’ There are a tremendous
number of assumptions in this sentence and no citations for these claims.
85: ‘Lastly, if generalization were advantageous, then medium size’ Is generalism always
associated with medium body size? Is this modal body size of the clade or of the mammal
community the species is found in?
216: ‘BM is the null phylogenetic model; only shared ancestry influences trait evolution’ This isn’t
quite accurate, it is a random walk with no consistent trends, and change is independent of past
character states.
Best of luck with these revisions, and I look forward to seeing a published version of this
manuscript.

Dear Drs. Wood and Padian:
We thank you and the two anonymous reviewers for your insightful comments on the manuscript, “Dietary
specialization is linked to reduced species durations in North American fossil canids,” by myself, Corinna
Casey, and Blaire Van Valkenburgh, submitted for consideration for publication in Royal Society Open Science
(RSOS).
Much of the reviewers’ critiques pertained to the framing of the work. We addressed these comments by
adding significant background information on the concept of specialization as applied to ecomorphology,
particularly in fossil carnivorans. We recognize that, in our original submission, we had omitted important
context that we had taken for granted as carnivore paleobiologists. We acknowledge that, by submitting to
label_version_2
RSOS, we had hoped to reach a larger audience outside paleobiology, because we believe that the patterns
that we have quantified in the fossil record are relevant to ecologists and other biologists working with the
modern record; therefore, providing adequate background information for our work is especially necessary.
We have also addressed comments about the phylogenetic aspects of the paper, as well as more minor
suggestions. We attach our detailed response, in which our responses follow each indented and italicized
reviewer comment. Where applicable, we have indicated the page and line numbers where we made
changes and have highlighted these changes in the main text and supplementary material by using red font.
We appreciate your constructive feedback and believe that the suggested changes have strengthened the
paper. We hope that the revisions are to your satisfaction. Please let us know if there are any remaining
issues for us to address.
Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Mairin Balisi

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper by Balisi et al. asks a very interesting question about whether dietary
specialization is correlated with longer species durations in fossil canids. They
argue that they do find a relationship between specialization and duration, but
that it is nuanced. Both hyper and hypo carnivores show reduced durations
relative to meso-carnivores. They do not find a relationship between geographic
range size and duration, or body size and duration once phylogeny is taken into
account. They find that drift, which they interpret as a Cope’s rule pattern is the
best explanation for the evolution of body mass. Dietary evolution does not show
strong evidence for one model versus another in this group.
Overall, I think that this is a well written paper addressing an interesting question.
I found the methods to be appropriate. My biggest issue with the paper is one that
will crop up whenever we start using terms like specialist and generalist. The
argument in the paper hangs on the definition of meso-carnivores as generalists.
However, based on the information they provide in the paper, I don’t agree that
they make a case for that definition. Meso-carnivores are intermediate in both
body size and their degree of carnivory, how does that make them a generalist?
Hypo-carnivores have a much more varied diet. Why are they interpreted to be
specialists? If the idea is that a generalist is able to have a longer duration
because they can take advantage of more different kinds of resources, then hypo-
carnivores are more generalist and their argument falls apart. Either the authors
need to better justify their categorizations of generalist to specialist, or (my
2
preference) reframe their question around different levels or the continuum of
carnivory and body size and better explain/justify their predictions.
I do think that the results are interesting and robust, it is just the framing of the
question and discussion that is problematic.
We are happy that the reviewer finds this paper well written, with appropriate methods
addressing an interesting question, and with robust results.
Regarding the definition of mesocarnivores as generalists and hypocarnivores as specialists,
we recognize that the information we provided in the paper was inadequate, especially for a
journal with a broad audience such as RSOS. We add explanation here and expand on dietary
context in our Background section.
1) We agree (and indicate in the paper) that hypocarnivores have a varied diet. However,
hypocarnivores as a whole eat a varied diet to a lesser degree or frequency than do
mesocarnivores. For example, the grey fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus—a
hypocarnivore or plant-dominated omnivore—eats not only plant material such as
roots, seeds, and fruit, but also some birds, mammals, eggs, carrion, and insects and
other arthropods. Its diet has been recorded to have as much as 79.8% vertebrate
meat in the winter (Hatfield, 1939) and as little as 44% vertebrate meat in autumn
when plant material is more plentiful (Hockman and Chapman, 1983). Coyotes, on the
other hand, are mesocarnivores or animal-dominated omnivores, and also eat birds,
mammals, reptiles, carrion, and insects and other arthropods, as well as plant material
like leaves and fruit. However, 50–70% of its diet (even as much as 82–90% during
winter; Windberg and Mitchell, 1990) comprises vertebrate meat.
The coyote’s range of potential prey items is similar to that of the grey fox. Yet, on
average, the grey fox diet is narrower—more constrained to plant material. The grey
fox has a primary diet that is not vertebrate meat. A primarily vertebrate diet is the
ancestral state for canids (more explanation about this point follows). Therefore, the
grey fox is a specialist relative to the generalist coyote.
2) Given the information available in the fossil record and given that the fossil record
stretches over long timescales, in this study we seek to frame the problem of dietary
specialization by supplementing a purely ecological perspective with an
ecomorphological and evolutionary perspective. Ecomorphological specialists have
deviated from more generalized ancestral morphology. As a consequence, they often
may have reduced evolvability, or capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation
(Kirschner and Gerhart, 1998; Wagner, 2008), relative to their ancestors. This narrows
their response to selection in evolutionary time.
Many previous workers have examined ecomorphological specialization in extant and
extinct carnivorans using the same dietary categories and similar measurements used
in our paper (Radinsky, 1981a; Holliday and Steppan, 2004; Wesley-Hunt, 2005; Van
3
Valkenburgh, 2007; Slater et al., 2009), including hypocarnivory (Crusafont-Pairó and
Truyols-Santonja, 1956; Radinsky, 1981b; Sacco and Van Valkenburgh, 2004; Figueirido
et al., 2010). Much of the information offered here comes from this robust literature.
The earliest carnivorans—and the earliest canids—originated with a full complement
of teeth (6 molars, 8 premolars, 4 canines, 12 incisors). This ancestral dentition was
equipped with blades to slice meat and basins to grind plant matter, enabling early
canids to be as omnivorous as raccoons today. This ecomorphologically generalized
toolkit provided the foundation for carnivorans to diversify into a range of diets.
Over evolutionary time, carnivorans—and canids—could deviate from this
generalized mesocarnivorous morphology by modifying the toolkit, largely by tooth
loss, to emphasize some functions over others. By losing posterior molars, some
carnivoran lineages reduced grinding area and therefore their ability to process plant
matter: the hypercarnivorous specialization. Other carnivoran lineages reduced their
premolars but enlarged the grinding area, with some clades flattening and co-opting
the blades as grinding surfaces, reducing their ability to process significant portions of
meat: the hypocarnivorous specialization.
Because lost structures rarely re-evolve (Dollo’s Law; Van Valkenburgh and Wayne,
2010), the loss of dental cusps and of teeth themselves is often irreversible. Lineages
that have begun to venture down the path of ecomorphological specialization tend to
be able to modify only features that remain. Therefore, lineages that modify the
mesocarnivorous morph—whether in the hypo- or hypercarnivorous direction—tend
to become progressively more specialized over evolutionary time.
The most hypercarnivorous canids (e.g. Enhydrocyon, Epicyon) have drastically reduced
or lost the grinding molars, losing a cusp on the grinding basin of the lower carnassial
to co-opt the now-trenchant basin as an extension of the carnassial blade. Meanwhile,
the most hypocarnivorous canids (e.g. Cynarctoides, Cynarctus) bear dentition quite
odd for canids: instead of cusps that could hold or pierce vertebrate meat, their teeth
bear ridges that converge on ungulate selenodont morphology: a specialization for
chewing tough plant matter.
In addition to the expanded text (lines 69-94), we now include in the Supplementary Material
photos of the lower jaws of representative extant mesocarnivores (raccoon and coyote), as
well as extant hypercarnivores (spotted hyena and gray wolf) and extant hypocarnivores (bat-
eared fox and kinkajou) (Figure S1). We also include diagrams of extinct hypocarnivores like
Cynarctoides in order to illustrate the extremity of hypocarnivorous ecomorphology among
extinct canids (Figure S2).
The other issue I had with the paper is the presentation of some of the figures.
Figure 1, in particular, is really hard to read. The choice of symbols for the extinct
species makes it extremely difficult to figure out which points go with which
groups with staring at it for a while. Consider something other than open
4
up/down triangles. In addition to labeling your PC access include an additional
bit of information with an arrow on the x-axis indicating increased carnivory. On
the y-axis indicate the durophagy axis. Somewhere in the paper you indicate that
jaw shape is also important. Including images of the range and direction of
change in jaw shape would be helpful.
We converted the pink open shapes to black open shapes to improve visibility. We do think
that plotting our extant comparative database as filled symbols and the extinct fossil
unknowns as hollow symbols is a good way to distinguish the two. But, we recognize the
reviewer’s point that the open up / down triangles are confusing, and so have changed these
to open squares and circles.
We have also implemented the reviewer’s other recommendations, which are quite useful in
clarifying the diagram.
I did not find Fig. 3 to be very useful. It also was difficult to read and required
staring at it for a long time to figure out what it meant. In this case, it may just be
the angle. Try rotating the images to see if it helps. If it doesn’t, consider multiple
bivariate plots with shading for duration similar to fig. S4.
Apologies; we are unsure about the figure mentioned. Figure 3 is our quantile-regression plot
showing the relationship between duration and specialization for various values of t. Based
on the mention of “angle” and “rotation”, we think that the reviewer meant to refer to Figure
4, our three-dimensional scatterplots, which can be rotated using different angles. We have
gone ahead and re-plotted Figure 4 as two bivariate plots of mass and carnivory with shading
for duration, similar to Figure S4 (now Figure S6).
I had a number of minor comments that I will list in order in which I encountered
them in the manuscript.
Line 25: You make a prediction about geographic range size and duration in the
abstract, but don’t include that result in your abstract.
We omitted this result in our abstract because of word-count constraints. With advice from
the editors, we would be happy to revise the abstract to mention it briefly.
Line 59: How large? Give an example.
The largest extinct canids were estimated to have reached over 90 kg in body mass (e.g.
Sorkin, 2008). We have added this information as a parenthetical note in the manuscript (page
4, line 101).
Line 64: hypocarnivory involves eating lots of different things. How is that a
specialization?
We appreciate that we omitted significant explanation for hypocarnivory as a specialization.
We hope that the explanation above, the expanded context in our Background section, and
5
the lower-jaw diagrams added to Figure 1 and the Supplementary Material are sufficient to
contextualize hypocarnivory as ecomorphological specialization within our study system.
Line 69: negative does not equal no statistical association. fix language.
We do mean that Van Valkenburgh et al. (2004) found no correlation but a negative
association between carnivory and body size: the relationship was not statistically significant,
but a trend was apparent and may have been resolved with further processing of occurrence
data and updated analytical approaches, as we have done in this study. We have clarified our
meaning by adding the words “qualitative” for the negative association and “significant” for
no correlation (page 4, lines 120–121).
Line 85: What is generalist about being medium-sized?
Similar to hypocarnivory as specialization, several previous workers have related medium
body size to generalization. We recognize our need to back this assertion in the paper with
references—indeed, to have a more detailed discussion of the importance of body size—and,
in our revision, have done so.
Body size is a ubiquitous trait that exerts pervasive effects on a range of other traits, such as
habitat selection and resource use, that form a species’ niche (Hutchinson, 1959, 1965).
What is generalist about medium size? Medium-sized mammals are well within
morphological and physiological constraints that scale allometrically with mass, while
mammals on the extremes of the size continuum might approach these limits (Calder, 1984;
Peters, 1986). Because energetic requirements scale allometrically with body size, animals
tend to specialize on prey that maximize their net energy gain while foraging (Schoener,
1969). To sustain high metabolic rates, small carnivorans and other small mammals spend
most of their time foraging, specializing on high-energy food—such as insects—that are
available in sufficient supply and accompanied by low costs (Brown and Nicoletto, 1991;
Smith et al., 2004). Additionally, small carnivorans are biomechanically and morphologically
limited to small prey, because larger prey means greater costs (Rosenzweig, 1966); medium-
sized and larger carnivorans are ecomorphologically better equipped to eat a wider range of
prey sizes (Gittleman, 1985). Meanwhile, large predators specialize on large prey because
small prey are insufficient to sustain the energetic costs of large size (Rosenzweig, 1966;
Schoener, 1969).
Medium-sized mammals tend to inhabit a wide range of habitats, while relatively large and
relatively small species are distributed narrowly (Hernández Fernández and Vrba, 2005). This
is likely because small size limits the dispersal of small species, while the energetic costs
associated with large size (Carbone et al., 1999) constrains large species to inhabit habitats
with high productivity. Small mammals also exhibit greater turnover among habitats,
suggesting that—because of energetic and physiological constraints—they are limited by
environmental variation and/or biotic effects more than are medium-sized and large
mammals (Brown and Nicoletto, 1991).
6
We added a subsection addressing these points in the Background section: pages 2–3, lines
46–68.
Also line 85: Isn’t hypocarnivory more akin to being generalized? So why do you
predict optimum with meso carnivory?
We hope that our discussion of hypocarnivory earlier in our Response to Reviewers is
sufficient to contextualize hypocarnivory as ecomorphological specialization within our study
system.
Line 120: more information on how you predicted numerical values please.
We added more information to this section in the Methods: page 6, lines 170–175.
Line 134: How did you handle overlap in the databases?
In cases of overlap between the two databases, we used the occurrence record from NeoMap
because NeoMap’s maximum and minimum age records, when cross-checked against the
literature, were more precise than those of Fossilworks / the Paleobiology Database, which
assigns dates based on the occurrence or locality’s time interval and therefore tends to be of
more variable precision. We also added this information to the manuscript: page 6, lines 191–
196.
Line 144: Why are there only 92 in your supplementary dataset?
The dataset included in our supplementary information contains only the 92 fossil canid
species with both morphometric and either duration or geographic data. Species that lacked
morphometric data were omitted. Typically, these species were quite fragmentary, so that—
while we know that they existed and may be able to infer their ecology qualitatively—we
were not able to integrate them into our final quantitative analyses that examined the
relationship between intrinsic traits and emergent properties.
For completeness, we have since revised the supplementary dataset to include all 130
species, even those with duration or geographic-range data but no morphometric data.
Line 173: include your R code in the supplementals.
We will upload the R code to Dryad with our other supplementals.
Line 189: you refer to figure 2 before figure 1. You never refer to fig. s3 n the main
text.
Thank you. Despite this reference, Figure 1 does need to be placed first, because it introduces
the dietary categorizations as well as much of our methodology. We have therefore deleted
the original Figure 2 reference here. We have also fixed the reference to Figure S3 in the main
text.
Line 238: put carnivory on your axes. Define durophagous here.
“Carnivory” added to x-axis. Definition of “durophagous” added on page 9, lines 306–307.
7
Line 240: remind us here what RUGA tells us.
Added a parenthetical note on RUGA (page 9, lines 308–309).
Line 242: consider putting images of this on the graph in the appropriate places to
illustrate this point.
Added representative images of lower jaws on the graph.
Line 302: Tables 3 and 4 have somewhat contradictory results. Table3 says a
model with all three variables is far and away the best model. Table 4 says only
BM and carnivory are significant.
Deleted Table 4, which represented stepwise regression and was not mentioned in the
Methods.
Line 314, 320: should be S3
Corrected; thank you.
Line 347: I disagree with this definition of specialization.
Hypocarnivores are specialists in our study system; please see above.
Line 371: What is species success in a modern ecosystem? Aren’t many of the traits
you list actually ways we define success, not things that correlate with it?
We have rewritten this sentence to begin, “Species success in extant ecosystems is often
defined as…”
Line 376: but now you seem to be defining extinction risk as “success”. However,
extinction risk in modern systems is highly dependent on human impacts and
cannot be used as similar to extinction risk and success in pre-human ecosystems.
It is true that extinction risk in modern systems is highly dependent on human impacts.
However, large herbivores and carnivores have intrinsic ecological vulnerability even without
human impacts, for instance because of high metabolic costs and long inter-birth intervals
associated with large body size (Ripple et al., 2014; Van Valkenburgh et al., 2016).
Line 420-422: I strongly disagree with this characterization of your results.
hypocarnivores have the most generalized diets.
Please refer to our discussion of hypocarnivory above.
Lines 419-433: Consider switching the order of your concluding paragraphs.
We agree with this suggestion and have reversed the two paragraphs.
Line 603: I don’t think you ever use this reference.
Reference removed.
8
Figure 3: there is no red line.
Thank you; we unintentionally omitted our red line. We have now restored it.
Figure 5: This figure is almost exactly the same as S3 in the supplement. I’m not
sure you need both.
We removed the original Figure S3.
Figure S3 and S4: You never refer to S3 in the main text. Where you refer to S4, I
think you mean S3. If so, then you never refer to S4 in the text.
Thank you for catching our error. Figure references corrected.

Comments to the Author(s)
First, I would like to applaud the authors for this interesting study of canid ecology
and evolution using phylogenetic methods. I am happy to see the integration of
fossil and extant taxa used to investigate the full diversity of a lineage, rather than
relying on extant taxa alone. The finding of “a non-linear relationship between
species duration and degree of carnivory: species at either end of the carnivory
spectrum tend to have shorter durations than mesocarnivores” is an exciting one.
I think this should be published following major revisions, mostly in the form of re-
writing to hone in on key ecological concepts and hypotheses, and to include
map figures.
Overall, I think the dataset and analyses are sound, though not particularly novel,
and the paper feels as though it is not fully settled on the hypotheses it is testing –
more descriptive of the canid patterns. The morphological metrics chosen are
appropriate and the inclusion of fossil and extant taxa is important. The
phylogenetic analyses are basic, but ok if interpreted in a narrower scope.
However, the conceptual framework and conclusions the authors draw from this
limited dataset require more attention and refining, particularly regarding
sweeping use of major ecological concepts. Resilience and ‘generalism’ are
concepts in ecology with specific definitions, and require attention to nuance, a
discussion of niche, and reflection on how these topics have been addressed in the
empirical literature. For example, blanket statements such as “Because
generalization enables species to widen resource use and withstand disturbance
(line 19)” are made with significant assumptions and not well cited, particularly in
literature that is outside of paleontology or canids. Again, it would be very helpful
if the authors used examples and citations from ecology literature, given their use
of these concepts in framing the paleontological dataset.
I feel that the ecological conclusions the authors draw from these data are
unsupported by the data; however, I do feel that the data provide conclusions of
9
smaller scope that are certainly publication worthy. I recommend reframing
hypotheses as using the paleontological record of this lineage to test an
ecological question, with specific hypotheses linked to a more tightly defined
concept of dietary generalism. These issues pervade both the introduction and
discussion. I recommend major revisions with extensive re-writing/framing, as I
think it will help the dataset be better appreciated by diverse audiences, especially
given its listing in “Ecology”. I have some minor concerns about a few methods,
particularly regarding range size.
Thank you for the sound critique. Your review, combined with Reviewer 1’s, has compelled us
to examine our assumptions more closely and to back “blanket statements” robustly with
citations, which we hope have strengthened the paper.
In response to Reviewer 1, we attempted to define “generalism” more strictly. We hope that
our expanded explanation above, and in the text (pages 2–3, lines 46–94), demonstrates our
understanding and justifies our use in this study of the definition of generalism.
Our question is both macroecological and macroevolutionary. Fossil evidence limits us to
inferring behavior and ecology from morphology, while the fossil record adds the dimension
of time to a purely ecological definition of “generalism”. Given the long timescales of the
fossil record, ecological generalism becomes associated with ecomorphological generalism
and evolvability. Ecomorphology can control a species’ ability to adapt to selective pressures.
We are less interested in whether or not a hypocarnivore such as a bear will become extinct
over short time scales and more interested in the evolutionary potential—as measured by
species duration and maximum locality coverage—of a generalist ecological strategy.
For a title, I would suggest a softer implication of dietary specialization for species
durations, such as “linked to” rather than “leads to”.
We appreciate the suggestion and have made the replacement in the title.
Use of the term resilience
The authors begin their abstract with the phrase “species resilience”. However, in
ecology, this term is associated with system-level responses to perturbations and
measuring the system’s return to the pre-disturbance state. Therefore, there is a
misapplication of an ecological concept for this paleontological context.
Further, this concept is only used again once in the Discussion, line 357, as
“This poor preservation may itself suggest reduced resilience conferred by
hypocarnivorous specialization.” This is a misapplication of an important
ecological concept. If this paper is geared towards ecologists, they may be
confused.
This comment was very informative; thank you. We used the term “resilience” following the
work of Jernvall and Fortelius (2004), which examines how trophic structure is maintained in
10
fossil mammal communities using the site-occupancy approach (which we also employ in our
study) but quantifies “resilience” for individual genera.
Despite also working with a paleontological dataset, by submitting to RSOS we are hoping for
our study to reach a wider audience, including ecologists working in extant systems, because
there is much to gain from a better integration of paleoecology and ecology. Therefore, we
wish to communicate concepts across fields as clearly as possible. We have replaced
“resilience” with “persistence”, and define the word in geologic time, to clarify our meaning.
Use of the term success
This may be a personal bias, but I generally think of ‘success’ in the fossil record in
the context of lineage success, eg diversification. Further, I would not agree with
the statement on line 38 that “In extant mammals, abundance, range size, and
population size are all measures of success.” That statement implies that all r-
selected species are somehow inherently better than k-selected species. A more
nuanced approach to this idea of “success” would be beneficial in reaching a wide
audience.
Does a species really need to have a wide range to be “successful”?
Given the mention of “traits” and “success” early on in the paper, I questioned why
there were no analyses looking at diversification, rate shifts, or ancestral state
reconstructions –more complex phylogenetic analyses.
Lineage success (e.g. diversification) is certainly another measure of “success” in the fossil
record, although it is not the only one. With success in diversification, the question becomes:
do lineages that are hypo- / meso- / hypercarnivorous demonstrate greater species richness
and higher speciation rates than those that are not?
We wish to point out that, for this paper, we examine the success or persistence of individual
species, which is a different problem than the lineage-diversification question above. Our aim
in this paper is to apply macroecological methods—quantifying intrinsic traits and emergent
properties, and any relationship between them, in a model clade—as an initial step toward
addressing the evolutionary problem of differential success (quantified by differential
duration, geographic range, diversification rates) associated with different ecological
strategies in geologic time.
We agree with the reviewer’s question of why this paper contained no analyses examining
diversification, rate shifts, or ancestral state reconstructions. We are happy to report that a
follow-up paper by Balisi and Van Valkenburgh—already in preparation as the first author’s
next dissertation chapter when this present manuscript was submitted to RSOS, and now
close to submission—examines in greater depth the relationship between extinction risk and
diet and delves into the more complex phylogenetic methods, such as diversification
analyses, that the reviewer mentions above. While the next paper would be useful as a
11
companion to this current paper, we needed to constrain this current paper to the relatively
“analog” analyses presented in order to avoid scope creep.
A species does not truly need to have a wide range to be “successful”. Our paper reflects that
there is more than one way to quantify success (e.g. geographic range can reflect success in
space, and species duration can reflect success in time). These axes of success are not always
correlated with each other, as we see in the different results obtained when analyzing range
versus duration.
Dietary specialization vs. generalism
It could be helpful to the reader if you spend a few sentences defining how you are
applying generalism to diet. You’ve mentioned ‘widening resource use’ but don’t
address how this affects your continuum of hypercarnivory, hypocarnivory, and
mesocarnivory. There also appears to be an assumed link between generalism
and body size, but it might be that the hypocarnivores are the most generalist in
diet (omnivores like black bears) despite being larger than something like a fox.
How do you define resource or niche breadth in this context? What is the body of
literature from stable isotopes and scat analysis for extant carnivores? What axes
of the Hutchinsonian niche are considered here?
Reviewer 1 was similarly concerned about our definitions of specialization and generalism.
We agree, especially for the broad audience of RSOS, that we glossed over important
background information. We have expanded on this context above and in our paper.
Reviewer 2 refers to “omnivores like black bears”, a point that we would like to address. We
mention above that the ancestral carnivoran and canid dietary ecomorphology is
mesocarnivorous. Deviations from this early dental toolkit—whether toward hypocarnivory
or toward hypercarnivory—requires modification or even loss of ancestral features, making
hypocarnivory and hypercarnivory ecomorphological specializations. Bears may be
omnivorous hypocarnivores, but they are evolutionarily derived: while the ancestral dietary
ecomorphology has blades and cusps and basins for slicing and grinding alike, bears have lost
the blades and flattened the teeth, widening the effective grinding area at the cost of slicing
area.
Interestingly, the polar bear (the most hypercarnivorous bear; a specialist) and the giant
panda (the most hypocarnivorous bear; another specialist) are classified as Vulnerable by the
IUCN.
Body size and extinction
The mammal literature does document strong patterns of body size and
extinction risk for modern species. This predisposition to extinction, if not
accounted for, could bias interpretations of duration and thus ‘success’. Was an
analysis of body size and extinction risk carried out in your study? (Apologies if I
missed this in supplement).
12
No, an analysis of body size and extinction risk was not carried out in our study. Modern
mammal species have been subject to human impacts, which could distort the predisposition
to extinction of modern mammals.
Remove in prep citations
The in prep citations are not appropriate, as the reader cannot follow up on these
claims and there is no guarantee they will be published in an accessible place.
Could a completed PhD thesis be cited instead?
The Ph.D. thesis is not yet completed; each chapter is submitted for publication as it is written.
We have removed the in prep citations.
Phylogeny requires more details
A key issue of this paper is the ambiguity regarding the phylogeny used, despite
being listed as a comparative methods paper. The authors refer only once to
using a phylogeny produced by Slater (2015), and accessing these details from the
journal PNAS actually means crossing a paywall, thereby not being open access! It
would be helpful to briefly summarize the context of this phylogeny, including the
type of phylogenic methods used (Bayesian?). Does it use both genetic and
morphological data? Does it provide full coverage of all species you include? It is
particularly important to note that Slater (2015) uses a fossil tip-dating approach,
which is an asset to your study. Do your species temporal ranges align with those
used in Slater’s phylogeny?
It could also be helpful to provide a text file of your pruned version of this
phylogeny with branch lengths as supplemental material, for those looking to
replicate your results.
A phylogeny figure highlighting the species included in the study and their
temporal duration could also be very, very helpful to the reader!
These are excellent suggestions. We have followed the reviewer’s recommendations by: 1)
briefly summarizing the phylogeny’s context in the Models of Trait Evolution section under
Methods (pages 8–9, lines 286–291), 2) providing as supplemental material a text file of the
pruned phylogeny with branch lengths, and 3) including in the supplemental material a
figure of the phylogeny highlighting the study species and their temporal duration (Figure
S4).
Geographic range & biases in associated methods
The time slices discussed in the methods/results would be important to display for
the reader to assess patterns and for replication of the study yet are not in the
main document nor supplemental. The authors refer to work in progress, but if
this paper is published right now, there is no way to access these data. They
should be included and would be helpful for the reader.
The authors may introduce a bias in their mapping methods in which they “chose
the time slice with the highest occupancy to represent maximum locality
13
coverage for that species”. If you are by default choosing the highest occupancy
slice, are you not biasing your understanding of how the species responds to
change? Might instead you consider a metric of variance through time that better
reflects range stability?
The authors also miss an opportunity to assess the impact of congener
competition in this map dataset, which could be calculated as range overlap
across time slices for species. This may have bounded the ranges of carnivores
(especially young radiating lineages or smaller-bodied lineages), thus biasing the
proposed link between geographic range, ‘generalism’, and duration. This point
should be addressed.
Thank you for the suggestion to include the time slices discussed in the methods / results. We
have included information about the time slices in the supplemental as the new Table S2.
Measuring variance through time to track range stability is a problem that also interests us,
but it is outside the scope of this paper’s goals. In this paper, we simply aim to quantify the
relationship between ecological traits and geographic range as a proxy for success and
compare this relationship to that between traits and species duration as another proxy for
success. By choosing the highest-occupancy slice for all species, we mean to choose the point
in time at which each species is most widespread, to compare species at the height of their
geographic expansion.
Assessing the impact of congener competition in this map dataset is an exciting opportunity
but also outside the scope of this paper. The reviewer mentions “young radiating lineages” as
potentially having been bounded by congener competition, an intriguing problem.
Regrettably, the fossil record—while relatively dense and of high-quality for North American
canids—lacks the resolution to capture competition in action, as a true ecological study
might be able to do. Rather, what we tend to witness in the canid fossil record is the ghost of
competition past. For instance, it is rare for more than one large hypercarnivorous species to
be found at the same locality. More typically, at any locality, canids may coexist but have
different body sizes. The likelihood of congener competition would be better resolved in a
future study by modeling eco-evolutionary dynamics to supplement the fossil record, which
we acknowledge in our final sentence on page 13, lines 484–486.
The authors also do not include the potential environmental constraints on range
(eg, ice sheets, sea level) that could again bias their use of range in a ‘generalist’
context, given the long temporal duration of the study. Were all lineages equally
exposed to climatic perturbations?
Ice sheets and changing sea level may well have constrained geographic range. However,
given that we standardize occupancy by calculating it as the number of cells occupied by a
given species in a time interval divided by the total number of cells occupied by all canids in
that time interval, these potential constraints on geographic range do not pose a problem for
these analyses. At any point in time, occupancy is standardized by the land area that
preserves canid fossils, therefore excluding land under ice sheets or under sea level. To clarify
14
our assessment of geographic success, we have edited the paper (page 7, lines 226–229) to
emphasize our use of locality coverage instead of convex-hull or similar estimates of
geographic range that may be sensitive to varying environmental constraints over time.
The authors discuss range size indicating the ability to cope with a wide range of
environmental conditions. This could actually be calculated and verified for
species that persist ~120,000 years to present using WorldClim datasets rescaled
to the grids similar to their ‘time slices’, with variance in bioclimatic values
calculated across the full species range. Is there any insight from modern wide-
ranging canids on this?
We appreciate the reviewer’s intriguing suggestion to analyze WorldClim datasets. We
downloaded occurrence data to match the WorldClim data resolution and ran species
distribution models for the two most wide-ranging extant North American canids: the coyote,
Canis latrans, a mesocarnivore; and the grey fox, Urocyon cinereoargenteus, a hypocarnivore.
However, in the process of doing so, we arrived at a few realizations that make this analysis
impractical for our study.
1) All extant North American canid species have only two, one, or no localities dating
back to 120,000 years ago.
2) The other paleoclimate datasets date to the mid-Holocene and to the Last Glacial
Maximum in the Pleistocene. Many Pleistocene paleontological localities are cave
deposits, which are good for preserving fossils and stratigraphy; but this means that, in
modeling the distribution of Pleistocene taxa, we risk modeling the geographic range
of cave sites rather than that of the animals themselves. This is a taphonomic risk that
we think would detract from the purpose of our study.
3) Modern canid distributions have been quite impacted by humans. Human-facilitated
habitat changes and resource inputs have enabled the spread of canids or carnivorans
that might otherwise have been restricted to small distributions.
Line notes/suggestions
17: ‘long timescales’. Replace with a specific time scale since you have this
available.
Replaced “long timescales” with “40 million years”.
19: ‘because generalization enables species to widen resource use and withstand
disturbance’. Or is it that wide resource use is what makes a generalist? Are all
generalists better at withstanding all types of disturbances?
We clarified wording that “generalization” corresponds to “broad resource use” and
acknowledged that not all generalists are better at withstanding all types of disturbance by
including the caveat “may”. (Unfortunately, word count constrains us in the Abstract, but
more explanation follows in the Main Text.)
65: ‘ecological specialization on taxon success’. Again, a lot of non-
operationalized ecology and evolution terms here.
15
79: ‘ecological specialization on taxon success. We expect that generalized
species of average size and mesocarnivorous diet will tend to survive longer and
have broader distributions than more specialized species simply because their
flexibility allows them to better survive times of disturbance and exist over a wider
range of environmental conditions.’ There are a tremendous number of
assumptions in this sentence and no citations for these claims.
Sincere thanks to the reviewer for compelling us to question our assumptions. We have
edited the text with citations to explain these claims.
85: ‘Lastly, if generalization were advantageous, then medium size’ Is generalism
always associated with medium body size? Is this modal body size of the clade or
of the mammal community the species is found in?
Reviewer 1 asked a similar question, which we answer at length above.
216: ‘BM is the null phylogenetic model; only shared ancestry influences trait
evolution’ This isn’t quite accurate, it is a random walk with no consistent trends,
and change is independent of past character states.
We have updated the Brownian motion description to reflect the reviewer’s phrasing.
