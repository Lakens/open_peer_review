This article is described about copper-catalyzed sulfenylation of indoles using sodium sulfinates.
The reaction can perform in air, and produce various expected products in good yields. To clear
the reaction mechanism, some experiments were investigated. The research is very interesting
and valuable. I’m sure that the article is suitable for the journal.
After minor revision, I would like to recommend for the publication..

label_comment_3
This work was well-recieved by the referees. The demonstrated scope with respect to the indole
and sulfinate reaction partners is quite good. The comments and suggestions raised by the
reviewers are appropriate. I very much agree that some proposed mechanism for the formation of
the disulfide from the sulfinate (first line in Scheme 3) is warranted. The inclusion of a heat
symbol (delta) above the arrow for the cracking of disulfide would be a good idea as well.
The entire manuscript should also be edited for proper grammar as well. Also, all references need
to be formatted according to journal style and have DOIs included. Information for proper
formatting and for links to recommended language polishing services can be found on the author
guidelines webpage (https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/).

I am satisfied with the revised manuscript. It is a shame that the authors cannot provide a
plausible mechanism for the formation of disulfide from sulfinate at this time, and encourage
them to pursue this detail in the future.

Response to Editor and Reviewers
(Answers to the questions point by point)
Editor's Comments:
This work was well-recieved by the referees. The demonstrated scope with respect to the indole and
ulfinate reaction partners is quite good. The comments and suggestions raised by the reviewers are
appropriate. I very much agree that some proposed mechanism for the formation of the disulfide from the
ulfinate (first line in Scheme 3) is warranted. The inclusion of a heat symbol (delta) above the arrow for
he cracking of disulfide would be a good idea as well.
Answer: Thank you very much for your appreciation of our effort. Add we have added a heat symbol
above the arrow for the cracking of disulfide.

Answer: Thank you very much for your appreciation of our effort.
Question 1:
Page 6, scheme 3: The role of air or O2 should be described in the scheme 3 or the text.
Answer: We have taken the reaction under a N2 atmosphere, the result was the same as under an air
atmosphere (Scheme 2, entry 23). So we think the air or O2 may have no effect on the reaction.
Question 2:
Page 6, scheme 2: Doesn’t the reaction in the absence of oxygen proceed? To clear the mechanism, the
eaction under N2 or Ar should be examined.
Answer: Thank you for your kind reminder. We have examined the reaction under N2 atmosphere and the
esult was showed in Scheme 2 (entry 23).
Question 3:
Page 3, scheme 3: The formation of disulfide from sodium sulfinate should be shown in detail.
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. It is a pity that until now we are not quite sure about the detailed
process. And further study on this topic is currently undergoing in our laboratory.
