Infection tolerance is likely a critical contributor to the evolution of immune systems and host-
microbe interaction dynamics, but it can be a tricky thing to measure, and analytical tools for
estimating variation in tolerance are still in their infancy. In this manuscript, the contribution of a
JAK-STAT pathway epigenetic regulator to fly tolerance of DCV is analyzed using both linear
and non-linear statistics on the relationship between viral dose and host survival. The results
highlight that while linear methods might give a better resolution on the coarse relationship
between increasing titer and the decline in host health, non-linear models give better leverage for
defining subtler but important parameters associated with variation in tolerance. For example,
while linear analyses suggest that G9a affects tolerance only in female flies, the non-linear
analysis reveals that the gene affects tolerance sensitivity in both sexes, albeit with different effect
sizes.
This manuscript is polished and well-written. The experiments are well-designed and the
statistics are appropriate for the questions and type of data. The discussion is appropriately
written in the context of the results. I have a few minor comments to increase the clarity of the
reasoning behind some of the decisions made in the experimental design of this work.
Comments:
While the authors cite that they use initial dose rather than viral load at 5 dpi in order to reduce
error and conform to the restrictions of the statistical method of analysis (eg. Line 137), I am keen
to know whether using 5dpi viral load instead changes any of the major conclusions. For
example, a new paper on resistance and tolerance to infection in flies (Howick and Lazzaro 2017,
Mol. Ecol, DOI 10.1111/mec.14017) suggests that the growth dynamics of microbes after the
initial dose are not always easy to extrapolate among genotypes, thus rendering initial dose
something of a dicey thing to use for estimating tolerance. While there does seem to be a
reasonable relationship between viral dose and viral load in this manuscript (and after it concerns
a pair of genotypes rather than dozens), I think it might be helpful to highlight that initial dose
might not always be the best idea, for those who wish to build off of this work. It might also be
useful to highlight that the distribution of viral loads may not be normal (perhaps another reason
why you chose to use initial dose, particularly given sample sizes?).
Section beginning on Line 169 – given the context of the dependence of results on dose, I think
some justification for using the highest dose to measure gene expression is needed. I can imagine
both pros and cons to this approach, and think it might be useful for some extra discussion to
highlight how the chosen dose might affect the conclusions from these results. On a minor note,
this section could use a line or two of explanation for the choice of these targets, considering the
full justification doesn’t come until later, in the methods section.
Line 192-193 – both here and in the introduction, you refer to the “separate” measurement of host
survival and pathogen burdens. What do you mean by this? That they are measured in separate
experiments? I assume that you are not referring to the restrictions imposed by destructive
sampling, as they are present in this experiment as well.

L 56-57: Regarding ‘there is no reason to expect the relationship between host health and
pathogen burdens be linear’. This problem has been discussed in literature older than ref 15, (e.g.
Tiffin & Inouye 2000) and quadratic terms were suggested and have been tested (e.g. Råberg et al
2007; Råberg et al 2014). I realise that quadratic terms are not as sensitive / do not go as far as
‘tolerance curves’, but perhaps it is worth including to demonstrate the evolution of this
problem?
L 124 paragraph: I wondered if the authors had tested for non-linear relationships between viral
dose and viral load. It’s not so easy to see all the data points in the figure because some are
overlapping, but the relationship for male and female G9a-/- does not look particularly linear in
figures 3c and d. Viral dose is subsequently used on the x-axis for the tolerance curves, because of
the positive relationship between dose and load (L 134-136). However, if the relationship between
dose and load is not linear, using dose as a proxy for load would have consequences for the
tolerance analyses. Would it make sense to check this by running additional tolerance analyses
using viral load instead of viral dose, e.g. as was done by Lefèvre et al 2011 278: 751-759?
L 144-147: ‘In males, however, no significant difference in slopes was detected between G9a+/+
and G9a-/-, even though the survival of G9a-/- males was lower than the survival of G9a+/+
males at almost all viral doses.’ I was not sure I followed the logic of this sentence. Lower
survival dose not necessarily translate into differences in slopes; if G9a-/- shows a similar percent
reduction in survival relative to G9a+/+ across doses then I would expect the tolerance curves of
the two male genotypes to be parallel to each other (as was the case).
L 154-155: ‘A comparison of the overall fit of the curves showed that G9a+/+ and G9a-/-
genotypes have distinct tolerance profiles during DCV infection’: Do the slopes of the curves
differ for the two genotypes?
L 185-190: A stylistic suggestion: Perhaps include the main finding from this study at the end of
the first paragraph? At the moment the reader has to wait until the end of the second page of the
discussion.
L 273 and abstract. I received slightly mixed messages from the abstract compared to the
concluding paragraph of the discussion. The abstract suggests that linear models may be
‘inadequate’ (L 22) and that non-linear logistic models are ‘better’ (L 32). But the concluding
paragraph says ‘We suggest that a combination of linear and non-linear models is ideal…’
4
L 283-287: A few comments about this paragraph:
1. The description of the generation of the fly mutants could be explained in a little bit
more detail, especially so that people unfamiliar with these methods could understand more
clearly how these mutants were generated. If I have understood correctly, the G9a-/- flies were
generated by imprecise/imperfect excision of the P-element, thereby part of the 5’ UTR region
was removed along with the P-element. The control on the other hand was generated by precise
excision whereby only the P-element was removed. I thought that ‘restored the functional
phenotype of G9a’ was a bit confusing in this context.
2. The authors refer to reference 16 for the generation of the mutants however, in the
methods of reference 16 they write that the mutants were generated previously and cite another
article (Kramer et al 2011; PloS Biol 9: e1000569) so perhaps the reference should be changed at
line 286?
3. Were the fly lines back-crossed into a wild-type background or do they have e.g. y1 or
w* on the x-chromosome? Please give the full genotype information for each
chromosome/mutant line.
L 307-310: I suggest to present the full RT and qPCR methods in this section rather than in the
later section (line 329 onwards). Please also include qPCR conditions and primer efficiencies.
L 314: If known I would suggest to include the approximate dose that these viral concentrations
deliver to the flies.
L 378: The upper limit of the 4-parameter logistic model was constrained at 25 days. However, in
the linear model the reaction norm for G9a+/+ passes through the y-axis at above 25 days (fig 3A
and B), which does not reflect health in the absence of infection. Some authors (e.g. Graham et al
2011 Func Ecol 25 5-17) have additionally incorporated health in the absence of infection, i.e.
examined the cost of infection as the y-variable, which gets around this problem. Might it be
useful or interesting to include this here as well?
L 381: Why was the slope fixed to -1?
Fig. 3 legend: What does ‘ultimate severity’ mean? Asterisks are mentioned in the legend but are
not in the figure itself. Include in the legend what the vertical dotted lines in c and d illustrate.
Also, probably a silly question, if sensitivity is one value estimated from the logistic curve, where
do the replicate values come from that are used in the ANOVA?
Minor points
L 120-122: Sentence starting ‘This…’. This interpretation would fit better in the discussion.
L 128-130: Sentence starting ‘ These results…’. Did reference 16 also examine the same time
period after infection as in this study? This interpretive sentence would fit better in the
discussion.
L 165-167: This sentence might also fit better in the discussion.
L 238: ‘…in mediating host sensitivity to increases in DCV…’. Typo? This doesn’t quite make
sense.
L 343: suggest: ‘…be affected by a…’
L 361: Presumably the response variable ‘fly health (DPI)’ means fly survival. If so, I suggest to
write this more explicitly.
Figs 2-4: Sometimes the figure legends contain the ‘a’ in G9a and sometimes they do not.

thank the reviewer for finding merit in our work.
mments:
ile the authors cite that they use initial dose rather than viral load at 5 dpi in order to reduce
r and conform to the restrictions of the statistical method of analysis (eg. Line 137), I am
n to know whether using 5dpi viral load instead changes any of the major conclusions For
mple, a new paper on resistance and tolerance to infection in flies (Howick and Lazzaro
7, Mol. Ecol, DOI 10.1111/mec.14017) suggests that the growth dynamics of microbes after
initial dose are not always easy to extrapolate among genotypes, thus rendering initial dose
ething of a dicey thing to use for estimating tolerance.
reviewer 2 also pointed out, we agree that it would be interesting to see the analyses with
l load instead of viral dose. However, differences in the sample sizes used to measure viral
rs and survival post-infection in this experiment posits a problem on the suggested analyses.
ur experiment, the number of replicates for viral titers’ measurement were five whereas
vival was measured using 20 replicates. To effectively use viral load in the analysis we would
uire survival and viral titre data for each individual fly. Indeed this is a further advantage of
ng viral dose as a reasonable proxy for viral titre without requiring large sample sizes to be
cessed.
ile there does seem to be a reasonable relationship between viral dose and viral load in this
nuscript (and after it concerns a pair of genotypes rather than dozens), I think it might be
pful to highlight that initial dose might not always be the best idea, for those who wish to
ld off of this work. It might also be useful to highlight that the distribution of viral loads may
be normal (perhaps another reason why you chose to use initial dose, particularly given
ple sizes?).
nks for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer that initial dose might not always be the
t way to measure tolerance. We have included this caveat in the manuscript (Line 138-141).
have also incorporated the usefulness of pathogen dose if pathogen loads are not normally
ributed especially when sample sizes are small. However, we would like to point out that in

mments to the Author(s)
6-57: Regarding ‘there is no reason to expect the relationship between host health and
hogen burdens be linear’. This problem has been discussed in literature older than ref 15, (e.g.
fin & Inouye 2000) and quadratic terms were suggested and have been tested (e.g. Råberg et
007; Råberg et al 2014). I realise that quadratic terms are not as sensitive / do not go as far as
erance curves’, but perhaps it is worth including to demonstrate the evolution of this
blem?
nk you for pointing this out. We have included the suggested changes in the manuscript.
ase refer to Line 57-61.
24 paragraph: I wondered if the authors had tested for non-linear relationships between viral
e and viral load. It’s not so easy to see all the data points in the figure because some are
rlapping, but the relationship for male and female G9a-/- does not look particularly linear in
res 3c and d. Viral dose is subsequently used on the x-axis for the tolerance curves, because
he positive relationship between dose and load (L 134-136). However, if the relationship
ween dose and load is not linear, using dose as a proxy for load would have consequences for
tolerance analyses. Would it make sense to check this by running additional tolerance
lyses using viral load instead of viral dose, e.g. as was done by Lefèvre et al 2011 278: 751-
?
agree with the reviewer that a non-linear relationship between dose and load could have
sequences for our tolerance analyses. We also realize the usefulness of viral load for the
rance analyses to circumvent this problem. We have addressed this issue in response to first
iewer’s comments. We had different number of replicates for viral load and survival assay.
ce we did not have comparable replicate numbers, using load would not be ideal in this case.
44-147: ‘In males, however, no significant difference in slopes was detected between G9a+/+
G9a-/-, even though the survival of G9a-/- males was lower than the survival of G9a+/+
es at almost all viral doses.’ I was not sure I followed the logic of this sentence. Lower
vival does not necessarily translate into differences in slopes; if G9a-/- shows a similar
cent reduction in survival relative to G9a+/+ across doses then I would expect the tolerance
ves of the two male genotypes to be parallel to each other (as was the case).
nk you, we indeed wanted to convey that lower survival need not translate into lower
rance when rate of health decline is similar. We have modified Line 149 to make it clear.
54-155: ‘A comparison of the overall fit of the curves showed that G9a+/+ and G9a-/-
otypes have distinct tolerance profiles during DCV infection’: Do the slopes of the curves
er for the two genotypes?
s comparison particularly refers to the overall curve which include all the components. For
the non-linear analyses, we fixed the slope of the curve to -1 and therefore, slope could not be
pared. We fixed slopes because we did not have enough data points spanning the slope that
could use the data to accurately measure the slope.
85-190: A stylistic suggestion: Perhaps include the main finding from this study at the end of
first paragraph? At the moment the reader has to wait until the end of the second page of the
cussion.
per reviewer’s suggestion, we have included main findings of the study after first paragraph
iscussion. Please refer to Line 197-202 to see the incorporated change.
73 and abstract. I received slightly mixed messages from the abstract compared to the
cluding paragraph of the discussion. The abstract suggests that linear models may be
dequate’ (L 22) and that non-linear logistic models are ‘better’ (L 32). But the concluding
agraph says ‘We suggest that a combination of linear and non-linear models is ideal…’
have fixed this discrepancy between our abstract and conclusion. We have corrected the
tract suggesting that both linear and non-linear estimates of tolerance are useful.
83-287: A few comments about this paragraph:
he description of the generation of the fly mutants could be explained in a little bit more
ail, especially so that people unfamiliar with these methods could understand more clearly
these mutants were generated. If I have understood correctly, the G9a-/- flies were
erated by imprecise/imperfect excision of the P-element, thereby part of the 5’ UTR region
removed along with the P-element. The control on the other hand was generated by precise
ision whereby only the P-element was removed. I thought that ‘restored the functional
notype of G9a’ was a bit confusing in this context.
thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have changed the text Line 298 in the Methods
tion to make it more precise.
he authors refer to reference 16 for the generation of the mutants however, in the methods of
rence 16 they write that the mutants were generated previously and cite another article

?

78: The upper limit of the 4-parameter logistic model was constrained at 25 days. However,
he linear model the reaction norm for G9a+/+ passes through the y-axis at above 25 days (fig
and B), which does not reflect health in the absence of infection. Some authors (e.g. Graham
l 2011 Func Ecol 25 5-17) have additionally incorporated health in the absence of infection,
examined the cost of infection as the y-variable, which gets around this problem. Might it be
ful or interesting to include this here as well?
agree with the reviewer that it would be useful to include health in the absence of infection.
wever, the way our study was conducted limits us to use the measure of health under
nfected condition in our analyses. In this experiment, we observed our flies for only 25 days
t-infection. Generally, wild-type flies under uninfected conditions survive much longer (~40-
days). Since, this experiment was stopped earlier, our estimation of health under uninfected
dition is skewed. Consequently, our estimates of vigor would be biased. For this reason, we
her compared vigor from the non-linear model nor used the intercept estimates from the
ar model.
81: Why was the slope fixed to -1?
accurately estimate the slope from a non-linear sigmoid curve requires more data recorded

not in the figure itself. Include in the legend what the vertical dotted lines in c and d

figure description. We have also included the asterisks in the figure to highlight groups with
nificant differences. The sensitivity or the other parameters are estimated from 20 replicate
