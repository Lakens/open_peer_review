The manuscript reported a simple and efficient method for the quantification of caffeine in
commercial beverages based on bare carbon electrodes. The results are interesting, and
promising. Therefore, the manuscript could be published after minor revision.
1) Increases in H2SO4 concentration resulted in a higher peak for CAF, however increase
in the background current was also observed. CV of background signal with high concentration
of H2SO4 should be provided. Signal-to-Noise ratio at different concentration of H2SO4 should
be provided.
2) The author claimed that H2SO4 provided much better performance than HNO3 and HClO4.
The results are interesting, but should be explained.
3) The author claimed that the proposed method has long-term stability, however the data was
not provided.
4) The surface morphology of the carbon electrode should be provided before and after the test,
since the H2SO4 may oxidize the carbon electrode when scanning in high positive potential.

Appendix A
Response to Referee’s comments
The authors are grateful to the referees for their comments and suggestions. Here below our
responses to the queries. The changes implemented in the new manuscript are reported in blue italic.
Referee 2
1) Increases in H2SO4 concentration resulted in a higher peak for CAF, however increase in the
background current was also observed. CV of background signal with high concentration of H2SO4
should be provided. Signal-to-Noise ratio at different concentration of H2SO4 should be provided.
The suggestions of the referee were followed, and a table containing the signal to noise (S/N) ratio for
different sulfuric acid concentrations was added in the ESI file, together with a figure of the CVs of the
background at different H2SO4 concentration. The main manuscript was amended with the insertion
of the paragraph reported here below.
Sulphuric acid was used at 0.1 M as the optimal concentration, as it gave the highest S/N ratio (data
shown in table S1 and fig S4). In addition, at high acid concentration (i.e. 1 M and 0.5 M) a broad band
was observed in the direct scan at 1.6 V (figure S4). This signal is likely due to the oxidation of carbon
atoms from the GCE surface in highly acidic conditions.
Table S1. S/N ratio at different sulphuric acid concentrations. The intensity at the maximum of caffeine oxidation peak was
considered for evaluation of the ratio. All experiments were performed using CV with a scan rate of 100 mV/s for a caffeine
concentration of 0.546·mM.
H2SO4 concentration (M) S/N ratio
0.01 2.84
0.05 3.34
0.1 3.67
0.5 3.26
1 2.38
Figure S4. Cyclic voltammograms of different concentrations of H2SO4 in milli-Q water, all voltammograms were recorded
with a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Black line H2SO4 0.01 M, red line H2SO4 0.05 M, green line H2SO4 0.1 M, navy-blue line H2SO4
0.5 M, light blue line H2SO4 1 M.
2) The author claimed that H2SO4 provided much better performance than HNO3 and HClO4. The
results are interesting, but should be explained.
This is indeed an interesting observation that incidentally has been reported very recently by another
group using a different type of electrode. The authors have added a new figure in the ESI, which shows
a direct comparison of the profiles obtained with sulfuric acid, nitric acid and perchloric acid all at 0.1
M concentration. The similarity of data between nitric acid and perchloric acid, both monoprotic acids,
supports the explanation that the difference is likely to be the result of changes in the ionic strength.
This is in agreement with the data reported by Chalupczok et al. A new paragraph has been added to
the main manuscript, including the most recent reference, as well as the additional figures in the ESI.
Hereafter the new paragraph and figure.
When different acids were evaluated all at the same concentration of 0.1M, perchloric and nitric acids
performed similarly while in the case of sulfuric acid a narrower and sharper peak was obtained
together with a higher S/N ratio (fig S3 supporting material). A possible explanation for the difference
maybe found in the variation in ionic strength between the monoprotic acids and the diprotic sulfuric
acid. A similar observation has been reported recently by Chalupczok S. et al. [1], using RuO2 who
conclude that changes in ionic strength have significant impact even when concentrations and pHs of
the solutions are the same.
Fig. S3. Comparison of the three different acids at the same molar concentration (0.1 M) for
electrochemical oxidation of 0.546·mM CAF solution on GCE using CV (scan rate of 100 mV/s). Red
line H2SO4 (0.1M), green line HClO4 (0.1M), Blue line HNO3 (0.1M).
3)The author claimed that the proposed method has long-term stability, however the data was not
provided.
4) The surface morphology of the carbon electrode should be provided before and after the test,
since the H2SO4 may oxidize the carbon electrode when scanning in high positive potential.
The authors are replying to these two comments in the same paragraph as they believe the two
things are linked.
The reviewer correctly pointed out that the highly acidic condition and positive potential can lead to
a change in the surface of GCE. However, considering that no signals due to the oxidation of glassy
carbon were recorded and long anodic pre-treatments were not applied, no further experiments were
performed studying the change in the electrode’s surface. In addition, the electrode was employed
for 6 months for the analysis of several caffeinated beverages without recording any differences in its
performance. Therefore, the long-term stability observed confirmed that the change in the electrode
morphology, if occurring at all, was in fact negligible. The authors believe that this is probably due to
the low concentration of acids used and the absence of any pre-treatments.
The following paragraph was added in the main manuscript, also adding additional references from
literature reporting the oxidation of glassy carbon electrodes when high potential and high
concentration of sulfuric acids are employed.
Previous works in the literature [2–4] have reported that a change in morphology of glassy carbon can
be observed when sulfuric acid is employed and long electrochemical pre-treatments applied.
However, in this proposed work, no long pre-treatments were done and no electrochemical signals of
the oxidation of glassy carbon were recorded, which suggest that oxidation of the glassy carbon
electrode is negligible under the experimental conditions used for this work.
The following paragraph was added to give more information about the long-term stability observed.
Furthermore, the electrode-based sensor has been used regularly over a period of several months for
the quantification of caffeine content in coffee samples, and no significant variations in its performance
were observed, suggesting that in the conditions employed any changes in the morphology and
properties of the glassy carbon electrode are not significant.
