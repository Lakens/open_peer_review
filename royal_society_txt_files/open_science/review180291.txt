Manuscript of Cooper et al. reports using surface modification of latex condom for lubricating
purposes. In general, the manuscript is well-written, the goals are very clear and the approach of
using hydrophilic polymer coatings seems reasonable.
However, the manuscript structure is unfortunate. I find it very imbalanced with a great
emphasis on testing (including IRB-approved testing) and a great lack of synthetic and
characterization aspects on polymer coatings.
I realize that Authors did graft coatings from poly(hydroxyethylacrylate) using
photopolymerization on latex surfaces in their previous study. However, in this work, one
additional component, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), has been added to the grafted coatings
formulation. No characterization (except SEM image which is not very informative) is provided
for the PVP-containing coating which is a significant drawback. I believe that Authors should
provide clear experimental evidence that this polymer coating is indeed attached to the latex
surface. Moreover, experimental data confirming presence of PVP in this coating, as well as
showing an effect of PVP on surface energy (making coatings more hydrophilic) should be
included into the manuscript as well. I do not think that the grafting should be taken as granted,
just based on a previous manuscript, without detailed characterization of actual coating with
PVP. If grafting occurs, what is the role of PVP during this process, is it grafted or not, molecular
weight effect. If presence of PVP changes surface energy, what is the mechanism, extent of this
effect? At least few such aspects should be addressed in the revised version. I recommend major
(experimental) revision for this manuscript.

Manuscript of Cooper et al. reports using surface modification of latex condom for
lubricating purposes. In general, the manuscript is well-written, the goals are very clear
and the approach of using hydrophilic polymer coatings seems reasonable.
1. However, the manuscript structure is unfortunate. I find it very imbalanced with a
great emphasis on testing (including IRB-approved testing) and a great lack of
synthetic and characterization aspects on polymer coatings.
Author’s response and action taken:
We appreciate this comment on the manuscript’s structure and readability, and agree
that synthesis and characterization should be described in more detail in the
manuscript, and not just in the Supporting Information. We have added such content in
the manuscript, specifically: coating synthesis and spectroscopic characterization.
Description of other characterization methods that are identical to those carried out in
our previous published study (J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 43930) are referenced thereto
to avoid repetition in the manuscript; these details are provided in full in the
Supporting Information.
2. I realize that Authors did graft coatings from poly(hydroxyethylacrylate) using
photopolymerization on latex surfaces in their previous study. However, in this work,
one additional component, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), has been added to the grafted
coatings formulation. No characterization (except SEM image which is not very
informative) is provided for the PVP-containing coating which is a significant drawback.
I believe that Authors should provide clear experimental evidence that this polymer
coating is indeed attached to the latex surface.
Author’s response and action taken:
Experimental evidence supporting the coating’s attachment has been added to the
manuscript: FTIR spectroscopic characterization is provided to confirm the coating’s
presence on the underlying latex substrate. Furthermore, we have clarified in the
Introduction section that the PVP-containing coating was indeed described in our
published previous study (with full synthetic details and characterization including FTIR,
contact angle, SEM, and AFM friction measurements), and have re-worded the
sentences that describe the previous study. Reviewer notes that SEM is the only
characterization of the PVP-containing coating in the previous study, but we kindly note
that FTIR and contact angle measurements were performed, and AFM was also
performed and revealed a dramatic lowering of frictional forces when the coating was
present.
3. Moreover, experimental data confirming presence of PVP in this coating, as well as
showing an effect of PVP on surface energy (making coatings more hydrophilic) should
be included into the manuscript as well.
Author’s response and action taken:
Two methods of experimental characterization have been added to the manuscript:
FTIR and contact angle analysis (described in the previous response to Comment # 2).
The latter, contact angle analysis, is reflective of PVP’s effect on lowering surface
energy and making the surface more hydrophilic (change in contact angle from 91.5 ±
7.1° without PVP to 84.8 ± 5.6° with PVP).
4. I do not think that the grafting should be taken as granted, just based on a previous
manuscript, without detailed characterization of actual coating with PVP. If grafting
occurs, what is the role of PVP during this process, is it grafted or not, molecular weight
effect.
Author’s response and action taken:
In preliminary pilot studies we indeed evaluated various coating formulation
parameters and hypothesized the mechanisms of both the macroinitiator and PVP in the
coating’s surface properties (specifically friction and durability). We have added this
discussion to the manuscript (Discussion section), including hypothesized effects of PVP
concentration and macroinitiator concentration on PVP entrapment at the surface as
such entrapment relates to magnitude of friction reduction and ability to withstand
repeated rubbing without delamination. We did not specifically examine the molecular
weight effect of PVP on surface properties; this is an excellent suggestion for further
studies we are currently undertaking. We will include these studies in a manuscript for
submission to a polymer-chemistry-focused journal.
5. If presence of PVP changes surface energy, what is the mechanism, extent of this
effect?
Author’s response and action taken:
PVP’s ability to modulate the surface energy of surfaces has been reported and
explained in mechanistic detail in the literature. Xiang et al. performed contact angle
measurements and also SEM coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy to
interrogate surface energy resulting from changes in coating composition related to PVP
concentration and molecular weight (Xiang, T; Yue, W-W; Wang, R; et al. Colloids and
Surfaces B-Biointerfaces 2013, 110, 15). Other similar examples are now cited in the
manuscript in the Discussion section as they relate to our selection of PVP as an agent
to impart hydrophilicity. For example, PVP was used to coat a polyurethane catheter
and the surface was examined by AFM, advancing and receding contact angle testing,
and frictional analysis (Tunney MM, Gorman SP. Evaluation of a poly(vinyl pyrollidone)-
coated biomaterial for urological use. Biomaterials 2002, 23, 4601). One property that
was not directly quantified in our work, although has been examined by others, is
surface roughness as it relates to hydrophilicity (e.g. Miller, J. D.; Veeramasuneni, S.;
Drelich, J.; Yalamanchili, M. R. Polym. Eng. Sci. 1996, 36(14), 1849, whose analysis
indicated that rougher surfaces led to a greater difference between advancing and
receding contact angles, resulting in decreased wettability properties. Our prior results
reflect this phenomena in which non-coated, rough latex surfaces have greater contact
angle hysteresis and poor wettability while smoother, coated latex surfaces showed
lower contact angle hysteresis and improved wettability. Thus, we reason that the
coating application resulted in a more hydrophilic surface on latex sheets due, in
addition to PVP’s chemical properties, to the coating’s rendering of a smoother
topological surface on the substrate.
