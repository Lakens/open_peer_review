The authors describe the results of a study in which several properties of the pectoralis and
supracoracoideus muscles of white-crowned sparrows were compared from wintering through
spring departure and at arrival at breeding grounds. While classical histochemical fiber typing
indicated the presence of one fast fiber type at all times, analysis of myosin heavy chain isoform
composition and of lipid content, as well as muscle mass assessments, indicated significant
alterations in muscle characteristics associated with the three annual periods. The authors
provide evidence for the expression of a novel fast-type MHC isoform at spring departure and
discuss how this isoform might accommodate functional demands that are placed on flight
muscles in this species that are associated with long-distance migration. Overall, the manuscript
is well written and the conclusions are generally supported by the results.

how they were identified. For example, were the pectoralis and ALD run in separate lanes to be

able to conclude, rather than assume, that the slower-migrating isoform is SM2 and that the
faster-migrating isoform is fast-type MHC? This should, at least, be stated, if that was the case or,
even better, should be shown as part of the same figure.
2. The authors state that antibodies that are known to recognize MHC-embryonic and

The identification of MyHCs is not clear. It appears to me that one sees two bands with EB165
which in the original description of the specificity of this antibody it reacts with neonatal and
embryonic MyHC of the chicken. So if is unclear how the authors can claim the "new' MyhC they
describe is unrelated to neonatal or embryonic. The easy method to resolve this is to show in a
single figure, not extracts just from adult muses as controls, but in the same blot- extracts from
embryonic, fetal, and adult birds. If this species is not available then chicken pectoral muscles
can serve as a substitute. Secondly, I suggest when trying to demonstrate that MyHCs differ in
mobility use less dense gels to get better separation in the blots.
in Table 1 the description of antibody B103 is not aligned with the antibody name. The reference

Comments to the Author:
The main conclusion of this paper is based on the interpretation of the appearance of two bands
for MyHC in Figure 3A, and two of the three reviewers suggest that the authors need to provide
more careful and clear support for their interpretation of this result. The authors should confirm
that they have used positive controls to support their interpretation of the MyHC bands.
The introduction should be revised to clearly and concisely review the literature on avian
physiological changes prior to migration and provide a concise review of the chemistry of MyHC.
Please consider using MyHC rather than MHC as the designation for myosin heavy chain,
because the latter can be confused with major histocompatibility complex.
If the authors feel that they can fully address these concerns, I would be happy to see a
resubmission of this manuscript along with a point-by-point response addressing the concerns
raised by the reviewers.

Appendix A
In an effort to make our responses easy to read, we have color-coded them in the
following manner: direct responses to the reviewers are colored blue and
quotations of altered manuscript text are colored red and quoted in a distinct font
(Arial).
Response to Reviewer 1:
The data presented is interesting (not novel), but could have been presented in a
more concise manner. In particular, the discussion is very rambling and
repetitious. A brief review of avian preparation for migration and the significance of
MHC biochemistry would have been appropriate.
We have reworked the abstract, introduction and discussion to include a broader
discussion of the physiological alterations and phenotypic flexibility of migratory
species throughout the life history stages of winter and spring migration followed in
our study (see lines 24-29 and 41-59). We agree that this expansion extends the
information on the stages at which our study specimens were sampled, providing a
fuller context for the flight muscle transformations. Further, we have attempted to
broaden our introductory statements on myosin heavy chain’s role in determining a
muscle’s contractile properties (see lines 95-107) in an attempt to make the study
more accessible to a wider audience.
Response to Reviewer 2:
1. Figure 3A, first lane: The authors should label the two MHC bands in this lane and
state how they were identified. For example, were the pectoralis and ALD run in
separate lanes to be able to conclude, rather than assume, that the slower-migrating
isoform is SM2 and that the faster-migrating isoform is fast-type MHC? This should,
at least, be stated, if that was the case or, even better, should be shown as part of the
same figure.
Isoforms from the chicken ALD and pectoralis were run in separate lanes on initial
gels to confirm their migration within the gel. Alterations to Figure 3 have been
made to clarify the identification of the SM2 and fast-MHC bands as suggested.
2. The authors state that antibodies that are known to recognize MHC-embryonic
and MHC-neonatal did not recognize anything in the probed samples. It is always
important to include positive controls when working with antibodies. Did the
authors include samples in which it was known that MHC-embryonic and MHC-
neonatal were present? If so, then this should be shown. If not, then it is possible
that these proteins are expressed in the white-crowned sparrow but that the
authors were not successful in the use of the antibodies. This could easily be
determined as it is known that the deep red portion of the adult chicken expresses
MHC-embryonic (originally shown by Susan Lowey) and that the adult chicken
lateral gastrocnemius expresses MHC-neonatal (originally shown by Everett
Bandman). A western blot with these two chicken samples, as positive controls, and
antibodies should be shown to demonstrate that the lack of finding either isoform in
the species examined was not due to a technical limitation.
Positive controls from chicken muscles were included for all antibodies used in this
study. As suggested, we have included a supplemental figure (Supplemental Figure
2) that demonstrates the negative reaction of the sparrow pectoralis myosin bands
with the antibodies that recognize chicken embryonic, neonatal, and slow myosin 2
isoforms. This figure demonstrates that the lack of reactivity was not due to a
technical error, as positive controls reacted with antibodies as expected, supporting
our conclusion that the sparrow isoforms are likely not embryonic or neonatal.
3. It appears that the degree symbol was converted to a solid, right-directed
arrow in several instances (e.g., line 115, line 152).
4. Line 298 “F2 is followed by a question mark subscript.
Thank you for pointing out these formatting errors. They appear to be a result of the
PDF conversion during submission. We have verified they do no appear in our
original manuscript.
5. Line 299: “significantly less” should be “significantly fewer”.
This change has been made:
The relative proportions of blue and purple fibers exhibited significant variation
across the three stages (ANOVA, F2,? =30.72, P<0.001), with the muscle of
departing birds having significantly fewer purple fibers than that of wintering
(P<0.01) and arriving (P<0.01) sparrows.
6. Lines 316 and 360: “specimen” should be plural.
We have made this noun plural throughout the manuscript as appropriate.
7. The authors refer, multiple times, to the two fast-type MHC isoforms as the
“heavier band” or “lighter band”, but these proteins should consistently be referred
to as the “slower migrating isoform” or “faster-migrating isoform”, as that is what
was actually observed. While it is generally true that slower migrating bands are
“heavier”, it might not be true for all high molecular weight proteins, such as MHC,
especially because many, if not all, vertebrate sarcomeric proteins contain about the
same number of amino acids - 1938, plus or minus only a few.
This terminology has been corrected throughout the manuscript, such as in the
following instance:
However, based on the antibody reactivity and MS/MS spectra of these two
isoforms, we have termed the slower-migrating of the two bands a second adult
fast isoform (adult fast 2), while the lower band that migrates with the chicken
adult fast isoform has been classified as the adult fast 1 isoform.
8. The DSHB at the University of Iowa requests that an explicit
acknowledgement be included in publications in which results obtained from their
antibodies are reported. Information related to this can be found at the bottom of
the screen at http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/FAQ.
Thank you for pointing out this oversight. Appropriate acknowledgement of the
antibodies used in this study has been added to the methods and materials section
as follows:
The monoclonal antibodies developed by F.E. Stockdale and E. Bandman were
obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the
NICHD of the NIH and maintained at The University of Iowa, Department of
Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242.
9. Table 1: The myosin heavy chain specificity for B103 is stated only as
“isoforms”.
The specificity for the B103 antibody in Table 1 has been realigned.
Response to Reviewer 3:
The identification of MyHCs is not clear. It appears to me that one sees two bands
with EB165 which in the original description of the specificity of this antibody it
reacts with neonatal and embryonic MyHC of the chicken. So if is unclear how the
authors can claim the "new' MyhC they describe is unrelated to neonatal or
embryonic. The easy method to resolve this is to show in a single figure, not
extracts just from adult muses as controls, but in the same blot- extracts from
embryonic, fetal, and adult birds. If this species is not available then chicken
pectoral muscles can serve as a substitute. Secondly, I suggest when trying to
demonstrate that MyHCs differ in mobility use less dense gels to get better
separation in the blots.
To address the issue concerning identification of the two sparrow myosin bands as
adult isoforms based on antibody specificity, we have include a figure that clearly
shows that the white-crowned sparrow pectoral isoforms did not react with
commercially available antibodies known to recognize chicken embryonic, neonatal,
and slow myosin 2 isoforms (Supplemental Figure 2). As suggested, muscle samples
from the domestic chicken known to contain these myosin isoforms were utilized as
controls to ensure western blots were conducted properly. As indicated by this
figure, it is apparent that the white-crowned sparrows did not react with these
isoforms, indicating that they are not similar to the chicken embryonic or neonatal
isoforms, thus, providing support for our classification as adult myosin isoforms.
in Table 1 the description of antibody B103 is not aligned with the antibody
name. The reference for F30 should be given.
We have addressed the alignment of the B103 antibody reactivity in Table 1.
Further, a citation for the reactivity of the F30 antibody has been added to the table
legend as follows:

this study (Rosser et al., 1996; Welch and Altshuler, 2009).
