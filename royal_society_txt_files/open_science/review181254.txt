1. In equation 4.7, what was the value of K for the computation? Why?
2. The software versions of EDEM and FLUENT should be mentioned in the manuscript.
3. The computational model was unsteady and the erosion tests were dependent upon time, so all
the results should depend upon time from Fig. 10 to Fig. 14. For example in Fig. 10, it is
impossible that the erosion rates keep constant all the time.

Comments on Manuscript Number: RSOS-181254
Title: Relationship between Wear Formation and Large
particle
Motion in an Elbow
This manuscript reports a study of large particle motions in a bend and their
effects on ear formation. The authors performed an experimental study as well
as using the ANSYS-Fluent and DEM commercial software. While the results
are potentially useful there are a number of areas of concern. There are:
<U+F0B7> On the numerical simulations part, there is no mention of flow regime.
One may infer that the flow is in turbulent regime, as there a one on
page 7 that the k-e model was used. There is no discussion on how the
intersection of flow turbulence and particles was accounted for. If the
turbulence fluctuation effects are ignored, then the validity of the
results is questionable.
<U+F0B7> The flow and particle boundary conditions are not fully discussed. It
was just mentioned on top of page 7 that the no-slip boundary condition
was used. It seems that the authors are no familiar with the options of
the code they are using for the turbulent flow.
<U+F0B7> Interactions of particles with wall also need more explanation.
<U+F0B7> It is not quite clear what are shown in Figure 8.
<U+F0B7> The wear model used need to be more fully described. Also the
schematic shown in Figure 10 need to be more clearly described.
<U+F0B7> The experimentally observed wavy nature of surface obtained in Figure
6 is interesting, but need to be justified if these are due to the mechanics
of the erosion process or defect of the materials used.
<U+F0B7> Figure 14, if justified is very interesting, but both the experimental and
numerical results are suspect. It is quite doubtful if the random particle
collisions with the bend will lead to periodic ripples for of erosion
shown in the figure for turbulent flows.

Reviewer comments 1
1. On the numerical simulations part, there is no mention of flow regime. One
may infer that the flow is in turbulent regime, as there a one on page 7 that the
k-e model was used.
Re: Thank you for your comment. Reynolds number is 2.577e5, we have added
it in Table 2 to illustrate the turbulent regime. (Page7)
2. There is no discussion on how the intersection of flow turbulence and particles
was accounted for. If the turbulence fluctuation effects are ignored, then the
validity of the results is questionable.
Re: Thank you for your suggestion.
1)The two-way coupling method was used in this research.
The force of particles applied on the fluid is considered in the two-way coupling
method. The motion of the flow fluid can be obtained with the local mean
variables according to the continuity and momentum conservation equations.
The governing equations of the fluid are given as follows:
Continuity equation:
<U+F0B6> <U+F0B6>
(<U+F061> f <U+F072> f ) <U+F02B> (<U+F061> f <U+F072> f u j ) <U+F03D> 0
<U+F0B6>t <U+F0B6>x j
Momentum conservation equation:
<U+F0B6> <U+F0B6> <U+F0B6>p <U+F0B6> <U+F0E9> <U+F0B6>ui <U+F0B6>u j <U+F0F9>
(<U+F061> f <U+F072> f ui ) <U+F02B> (<U+F061> f <U+F072> f ui u j ) <U+F03D> <U+F02D> <U+F02B> <U+F0EA><U+F061> f <U+F06D>eff ( <U+F02B> ) <U+F0FA> <U+F02B> <U+F061> f <U+F072> f g <U+F02B> Fs
<U+F0B6>t <U+F0B6>x j <U+F0B6>xi <U+F0B6>x j <U+F0EA><U+F0EB> <U+F0B6>x j <U+F0B6>xi <U+F0FA><U+F0FB>
where <U+0001D70C><U+0001D453> represents the fluid density and is a constant because the fluid is
assumed to be incompressible; u represents the fluid velocity; p represents the
pressure of the fluid; <U+0001D707><U+0001D452><U+0001D453><U+0001D453> represents the effective viscosity; x represents the
coordinates; g is the acceleration due to gravity; Fs is the interaction term due to
the force between the particles and the fluid; af is the porosity near the particle
and can be calculated as:
n
<U+F061> f <U+F03D> 1 <U+F02D> <U+F0E5>Vp ,i / Vcell
i <U+F03D>1
where Vp,i represents the volume of particle i in the selected CFD cell; n
represents the amount of particles inside the cell; Vcell represents the volume of
the cell.
2) Forces and torques from the fluid to the particles
The translational and rotational motions of the particles are calculated using
Newton's kinetic equations:
dv
m = mg + <U+F0E5> Fc <U+F02B> Fdrag <U+F02B> Fm <U+F02B> Fsl
dt
d<U+03C9>
I = <U+F0E5> Tc <U+F02B> Tf
dt
where Fc, Fdrag, Fm and Fsl respectively represent the contact force, fluid drag
force, Magnus force and Saffman lift force. m and I are respectively the mass
and moment of inertia of the particles. Tc and Tf respectively denote the contact
torque and the torque generated by the fluid phase.
3) Forces from particles to fluid
In the study of this paper, the maximum volume concentration of solid particles
is 6.13%.In this case, the force can greatly influence the fluid flow, and the
two-way coupling method must be used.
n
<U+F02D><U+F0E5>(Fdrag i
+Fsli +Fm )
FS <U+F03D> i <U+F03D>1
Vcell
where Vcell is the volume of the cell and n represents the total number of particles
in this cell. Actually, this equation is based on the principle of Newton's third law
of motion such that the forces of the liquid acting on the particles will react on
the liquid from the particles in each computational cell.
3. The flow and particle boundary conditions are not fully discussed. It was just
mentioned on top of page 7 that the no-slip boundary condition was used. It
seems that the authors are no familiar with the options of the code they are using
for the turbulent flow.
Re: We are grateful for the suggestion. Your comment is helpful to further
improve the manuscript. We have added in section of 4.4(Page 7). The changes
of the manuscript have been highlighted in yellow text.
4. Interactions of particles with wall also need more explanation.
Re: Thanks for your suggestion.
According to the soft ball model, when the particle i collides with the wall
surface, the normal force of the wall surface to the particle is:
Fc,n =-kndn <U+F02D><U+F068>n vn
The normal force acting on a particle by its wall is:
t t <U+F02D> <U+F068>t vt
Fc,t =-kd
where Vn and Vt are the normal relative velocity and tangential relative velocity
between the particles; kn and kt are respectively the normal and tangential
stiffness of the springs; and <U+03B7>n and <U+03B7>t are respectively the normal and tangential
damping coefficients. dn and dt respectively denote the normal displacement and
tangential displacement between particles.
The reaction force of the particle to the wall surface is equal to the force of the
wall surface to the particle. The wall is treated as an infinitely sized particle, so
its mass is also infinite. Because of the finite force, the acceleration of infinite
particle (wall) is 0. In addition, the initial velocity of the wall is 0, so the wall
remains stationary.
5.It is not quite clear what are shown in Figure 8.
Re: Thank you for your comment. We have detailed the data source of Figure 8
and the purpose to be explained. From inlet to outlet of the bend, 130 particles
are selected randomly after the flow has stabilized from CFD-DEM simulation.
The average velocity magnitude of these particles is calculated to illustrate the
movement state of the particles in the bend.(Page 10)
6. The wear model used need to be more fully described. Also the schematic
shown in Figure 10 need to be more clearly described.
Re: Thank you for your suggestion .
The wear model has been re-described more fully (Page 7). In addition, the
buffer effect shown in the schematic diagram of figure 10 is also described in
more detail. (Page 12)
7. The experimentally observed wavy nature of surface obtained in Figure 6 is
interesting, but need to be justified if these are due to the mechanics of the
erosion process or defect of the materials used.
Re: We are grateful for the suggestion. We have added the processing of
experimental materials in the manuscript. In addition, we have added the
appearance of the aluminum sheet before the experiment in Fig.6. The aluminum
sheets have a surface roughness of Ra3.2 and are supplied by local suppliers. All
aluminum sheets are processed in a uniform procedure before and after the
experiment:
1). Rinse the surface of the aluminum sheet with water;
2). Gently wipe the surface with a soft cloth soaked with water-diluted detergent;
3). Rinse the surface with plenty of water to wash away the dirt;
4). Dry the aluminum sheets.
So all the aluminum sheets meet the experimental requirements.(Page 3)
8. Figure 14, if justified is very interesting, but both the experimental and
numerical results are suspect. It is quite doubtful if the random particle collisions
with the bend will lead to periodic ripples for of erosion shown in the figure for
turbulent flows.
Re: We are grateful for the suggestion.
1) Experiment: The aluminum sheets have a surface roughness of Ra3.2. All
aluminum sheets are processed in a uniform procedure before and after the
experiment, to ensure that the aluminum sheet is in accordance with the
experimental standards (Page 3). In addition, each group of experiments is
carried out five times and the duration of the wear test is the same, to eliminate
the random error. ( Page 4)
2) Simulation: The two-way coupling method was used in this research. The
Euler-Lagrange approach is used in our numerical simulation. The flow field is
solved using FLUENT and the particle motion is calculated using EDEM. The
materials in the simulation are set according to the properties of the actual
materials to ensure the authenticity of the simulation.
The periodic ripples for of erosion is explained by ripple formation model of
Karimi A and Schmid R K.(Page 15)

1. In equation 4.7, what was the value of K for the computation? Why?
Re: Thank you for your suggestion .
The wear constant is generally calculated through experimentation of the
material, the wear constant ( k = 3.685e-4 ) was calculated from the data of B. K.
Prasad .
( Prasad B K, Prasad S V, Das A A. Mechanisms of material removal and
subsurface work hardening during low-stress abrasion of a squeeze-cast
aluminium alloy-Al2O3, fibre composite[J]. Materials Science & Engineering A,

Data of B. K. Prasad about abrasive wear rate of the base Al alloy.

The specific calculation method is as follows :
Archard wear model:
P
W = Ks
Pm
From this equation we can get the formula for K:
WPm
K<U+F03D>
sP
From the data of B. K. Prasad:
W
<U+F03D> 1.351*10<U+F02D>4 mm3 / mm
s
Pm =60N / mm2
P =22N
So the value of K is:
WPm
K<U+F03D> =3.685e-4
sP
2. The software versions of EDEM and FLUENT should be mentioned in the
manuscript.
Re: Thank you very much for your comments. We have already indicated
software versions of EDEM and FLUENT in the manuscript. The software
versions of EDEM is 2.7,the software versions of FLUENT is 15.0.(Page 7)
3. The computational model was unsteady and the erosion tests were dependent
upon time, so all the results should depend upon time from Fig. 10 to Fig. 14.
For example in Fig. 10, it is impossible that the erosion rates keep constant all
the time.
Re: Thank you for your suggestion.
In terms of experiment, each group of experiments is carried out five times and
the duration of a wear experiment is same. Then we calculate the average erosion
rate for each group by mass difference before and after the experiment.
In terms of numerical simulation, all the research data was selected after the
erosion was stabilized. This erosion stability means that the flow field has
stabilized and the particles are filled with the entire bend. In our study, we did
not put particles from 0s to 0.1s. During this period, the flow field calculation
was stable. After 0.1s, the‘particle factory’began to generate a certain mass flow
particles into the bend. From 0.2s to 1s, the particles have completely entered the
elbow, and the erosion has been stabilized. At this time, the wall erosion is
counted every 0.001s, and the average wear rate during this period is calculated.
In Fig. 10 and Fig. 12, the experimental and numerical simulation data are
average erosion rates for a period of time. The numerical simulation data is from
the beginning of wear stability.
In Fig. 11, the figure shows the position and motion of the particles at four mass
concentrations at 1s results from CFD.
In Fig. 13, the figure shows the surface topography of the central position of the
test sheet at different distances after 25 minutes of experimentation.
In Fig. 14, the figure shows the surface topography (after 25-minute experiment),
wear cloud (after 1-s simulation) and particle position in the flow field
(simulation at 1s) at 8 cm for mass concentrations.

Title: Relationship between Wear Formation and Large
particle
Motion in an Elbow
While the paper has improved, there are still a few points that need to be
clarified. There are:
<U+F0B7> On the numerical simulations part, the author noted that Re=25770 and
the flow is in turbulent state of motion and the k-e model was used.
They mention about two-way coupling in their response but there is no
discussion in manuscript. There is no discussion on the interaction of
turbulence with particles. The authors seem not to realize that the k-e
model solves for the average velocity and the instantaneous turbulence
fluctuation need to be accounted for. While for large particles of about
3mm sued in this study the effect of turbulence may be small it need to
be discussed.
<U+F0B7> The discussions of flow and particle boundary conditions are
improved. The authors stated that the standard wall function was used.
But does standard wall function valid for a two-way coupled model?
<U+F0B7> It is not quite clear what is the merit of showing 130 sample realizations
in Figure 8.
<U+F0B7> The experimentally observed ripple patterns are interesting. Karimi
and Schmid [25] attributed these to cavitation and turbulent eddies.
The authors’ model does not include either but somehow shows the
ripple effect. This need to be clarified.

Reviewer comments 1
While the paper has improved, there are still a few points that need to be clarified.
There are:
1. On the numerical simulations part, the author noted that Re=25770 and the flow
is in turbulent state of motion and the k-e model was used. They mention about
two-way coupling in their response but there is no discussion in manuscript. There
is no discussion on the interaction of turbulence with particles. The authors seem
not to realize that the k-e model solves for the average velocity and the
instantaneous turbulence fluctuation need to be accounted for. While for large
particles of about 3mm sued in this study the effect of turbulence may be small it
need to be discussed.
Re: Thank you for your constructive comment. We have added the governing
equations of the fluid and equations of forces from particles to fluid according to
the comment and have highlighted the revised part in yellow text (Page5, Page6,
Page7). Because of the particle size (3mm) is large in this research, the inertial
force dominates the particle motion rather than the instantaneous turbulence
pulsation. So the k-e model was used in the numerical simulation of flow field to
solve the average velocity.
2. The discussions of flow and particle boundary conditions are improved. The
authors stated that the standard wall function was used. But does standard wall
function valid for a two-way coupled model?
Re: Two calculations of flow field and particle motion are not simultaneous
(shown in figure 4). The standard wall function is used to calculate the flow field
of the near-wall region. After one time step of flow field calculation, the calculated
data is transferred to calculate the particle motion. In this calculation stage, the
standard wall function does not appear.. So it does not affect the two-way coupling
calculation process.
3. It is not quite clear what is the merit of showing 130 sample realizations in
Figure 8
Re: We are grateful for the suggestion. We have added explanation of 130 samples
according to the comment and have highlighted the revised part in yellow text
(Page 10). The average velocity of 130 particles is calculated to describe the
motion rule of the particles in the curved region. And 130 samples are selected to
eliminate accidental errors.
4. The experimentally observed ripple patterns are interesting. Karimi and Schmid
[25] attributed these to cavitation and turbulent eddies. The authors’ model does
not include either but somehow shows the ripple effect. This need to be clarified.
Re: Thank you for your comment. We refer to the explanation of Karimi and
Schmid about ripple generation. In the study of Karimi and Schmid, the turbulent
eddy near the wall dominates the motion of the particles (120 microns). But due
to the particle size (3mm) is relatively large in this study, the vortex near the wall
does not dominate the particle motion. In addition, the inertia has an important
effect on particle motion. And the velocity difference between the near-wall fluid
and the bulk fluid will bring the deviation of particle motion trajectory. The
combination effect of these factors causes particles to bounce forward on the wall
surface regularly (shown in figure 15(a)). Over a period of time, ripples appear.
Reviewer comments 2:
1. It is suggested to simply add the explanation of average erosion rate for each
group by mass difference before and after the experiment.
Re: Thank you for your constructive comment. In the Dryad database, we have
carefully added data from five sets of experiments for each concentration,
including maximum erosion and average erosion. In addition, we have added some
explanation of the wear results obtained from the experiment and have highlighted
it in yellow text.
2. It is also suggested to simply add the explanation of all the computational
erosion data was selected after the erosion was stabilized.
Re: Thank you for your comment. We have added it according to the comment.
