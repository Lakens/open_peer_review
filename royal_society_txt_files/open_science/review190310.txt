In the manuscript “Simultaneous Evaluation of Losartan and Amlodipine Besylate using
Synchronous Spectrofluorimetric Technique and LC with Flourimetric Detection ”, the Authors
described two independent analytical methods for the concertation determination of losartan
(LOS) and amlodipine besylate (AML). The methods were optimized for the analysis of mixtures
containing both compounds.
This manuscript is similar to previous publications of the same Authors (see for instance: Anal.
Methods, 2015, 7, 8060, DOI: 10.1039/c5ay01134e) and “second derivative synchronous
spectrofluorimetric” methods were already employed for the determination of drugs in their
combined dosage form (see for instance: Luminescence. 2015 30(7):1011-9. doi: 10.1002/bio.2852).
In addition, the HPLC method is not new.
Nevertheless, this is the first report on the application of the two methods to LOS and AML
mixture analysis.
In general, the work is sound and the conclusions appear supported by the described results.
However, in my opinion, the language is not acceptable for a scientific publication. Consequently,
the employed words are sometime misleading. Moreover, the text contains numerous typo errors
and the format is non-homogenous (compare, for instance, the format of references 23, 24, and
25).
Additional points.
1) Several results are discussed in the text but not showed (see for instance paragraphs from 5.a.2
to 5.a.6). I suggest adding these results as supplemental materials.
2) Pag. 15, lines 20-23: “The results obtained by the suggested methods were matched with the
results obtained from comparison method (17).” Please, add a brief description of the comparison
method including the relevant experimental details.

In page 2, line 32; The sentence is not clear. So, add “which” after “phase” and replace “carried

In page 3, line 10; the reference no. 1 should be taken from a pharmacopeia or a text book rather
than a research paper.
Instead, the reference 1 research paper should be added to line 32 after “LOS”
The references 11 & 12 should be added in line 39 after “spectrophotometry” and TLC replaced

In page 3, line 53; You should add “previously” after “were”.

form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

In the manuscript “Simultaneous Evaluation of Losartan and Amlodipine Besylate

1- This manuscript is similar to previous publications of the same Authors (see
for instance: Anal. Methods, 2015, 7, 8060, DOI: 10.1039/c5ay01134e) and
“second derivative synchronous spectrofluorimetric” methods were already
employed for the determination of drugs in their combined dosage form (see
for instance: Luminescence. 2015 30(7):1011-9. doi: 10.1002/bio.2852).
v-In this manuscript we use binary mixture[ LOS and AML] and this is another
combination other than [Valsartan and amlodipine] in Anal. Methods, 2015, 7,
8060, DOI: 10.1039/c5ay01134e or in[ nebivolol and amlodipine] in
Luminescence. 2015 30(7):1011-9. doi: 10.1002/bio.2852), with different
experimental parameters
2- However, in my opinion, the language is not acceptable for a scientific
publication. Consequently, the employed words are sometime misleading.
Moreover, the text contains numerous typo errors and the format is non-
homogenous (compare, for instance, the format of references 23, 24, and
