The paper investigates the capabilities of a relatively recent method, the delay vector variance,
concerning the quantification of nonlinearity in dynamical systems. The authors attempt to create
a benchmark for the use of the method for different structural dynamics systems with different
excitations and parameters. A significant number of simulation and experimental results are
presented in order to achieve this. The paper is generally easy to understand, although I have a
concern about its length. Maybe sections 4 and 5 of the paper should be condensed in one (since
they both give results for a big number of different simulations), and in that case it would be nice
if the authors tried to explain a bit more thoroughly the motivation behind the simulated studies
presented and give a summary of the conclusions driven by these simulations in order to then
continue with verifying these results on the experimental case. It is for this reason (the need of
change in the structure of the paper) that I suggest major corrections.
Another remark that I have is that although numerous cases are examined, I feel that there could
be some discussion added on the kind of nonlinearities that exist in some of these cases. For
example in Figure 1b: what kind of nonlinearity exists in this case? It would be nice if the authors
gave a brief description of the nonlinear characteristics chosen here and maybe a short discussion,
at that point, of what is expected from the method for the different kinds of nonlinearities that a
SDOF system could have. This also applies to section 5, where it might be good if the authors
gave the exact equations of motion used in their simulation.
Finally, in the conclusions section the authors end the manuscript with the sentence: “ The
application of DVV method on recorded responses of the observed structural system can be
useful in the initial continuous online SHM monitoring”. Although, I can understand why the
authors make this statement according to the results they present and the potential of the method
it would be nice if this was a bit further discussed not only in the conclusions section but also in
the introduction of the manuscript (with the explanation that damage introduces nonlinearity to
the system..).

This manuscript describes a very thorough investigation into the use of the delay variance
method for quantification of the nonlinearity of dynamic responses of a single degree of freedom
structure and a composite wind turbine blade. Useful experimental data are presented. The
manuscript provides a particularly detailed explanation of the theory behind the delay vector
variance method, the choice of embedding parameters, the dynamic response of a single-degree-
of-freedom system in terms of root-mean-square-error, the application to a car, and results from a
set of wind turbine blade experiments.
The manuscript does describe original research in engineering, and the results do not appear to
have been published elsewhere. The conclusions are in accordance with the data. The work is
ethical, with the experiments and analysis performed to scientifically and methodologically high
standard. My main concern is that the manuscript is overlong, and its sheer length obscures the
advances in scientific knowledge contained within.
Overall, the manuscript is quite readable in the style of a technical report, and covers a topic that
is appropriate for readers of RSOS. Unfortunately, the text is far too long, with too many figures
(many of which are Excel plots). The manuscript is over 100 pages long! In short, the science
appears fine, but the manuscript requires considerable editing to concentrate its message and
bring it up to journal standard.
My recommendation is for the manuscript to be declined for publication at this stage, but the
authors encouraged to resubmit a much more compact paper (say half or one-third the length) for
re-review, with relevant data made available through Appendices or a hyperlink to the more
detailed report.

The paper deals with a statistical method to assess nonlinearities in time series. The results of
extensive investigations on simulated and real datasets are presented. The main weaknesses of
this manuscript are as follows:
1. The current version of the paper is lengthy and difficult to read. Some relevant information to
understand the context of the study are omitted (the definition of signal nonlinearity is not given;
only a reference is provided but this makes a proper understanding of the paper difficult for the
reader not familiar with this concept). Results are presented in lengthy verbal form instead of
clear tables and figures, in particular for section 3 and, partially, section 4. A thorough review and
rearrangement of the structure of the paper to improve its readability and point out the big
lessons learned from the study in view of more general applications and not only the results
obtained from the various tests is mandatory.
2. The general context is not presented. Methods different from DVV are not considered, even in
the literature review. Spending some words to collocate the present study in the context of the
scientific literature on SHM is highly recommended. Otherwise, SHM is mentioned in the
manuscript without clear links with the presented study. The opportunities of the method for
vibration based SHM have to be clearly defined.
3. The aim of the study is to analyze the output of the method in view of applications where
output-only information is available. However, it considers both deterministic and random
inputs. The reasons should be clarified in light of the technical literature about vibration based
SHM based on output-only measurements.
4. On pag. 7 it is stated that the number of surrogates in simulations is equal to 25, while in the
quoted reference (Ref. [5]) it is 99. The authors should clarify the reason behind the choice of a
value of Ns much lower than that reported in similar studies in the literature.
5. How the values of driving frequency and natural frequency for the case of harmonic load
imposed on undamped SDOF system are selected? Please, explain.
6. At lines 4-6 on pag. 22 it is stated that "Method 3 shows a consistent trend" but only two points
are considered (at frequencies 3 Hz and 12 Hz). How the "consistent trend" has been identified?
Please, explain or amend.
7. On pag. 25 line 22 it is stated that the response of the "SDOF system excited by random
vibration" is analyzed. However, the next lines clarify that the system is actually excited by a
harmonic input, whose amplitude is a random variable. The frequency of the input force is 3.5
Hz. Random signals are very different from the one considered in this case. This is not a
secondary aspect. Clarifications are mandatory. Consider that vibration based SHM makes large
use of the random response of structures. Evaluation of the performance of the method in the
presence of actually random signals is critical to assess the potentialities of the method for real-
life applications.
8. Please, amend the sentence at lines 7-8 on pag. 7: "By using iAAFT method instead of an
iterative AAFT...". The method is actually the same. There is probably a misprint.
9. Please, amend the sentence at lines 14-17 on pag. 14. It suddenly end with "the".

The paper examines the Delay Vector Variance (DVV) method as a means of assessing
nonlinearities in dynamical systems. The authors examine various simulated and experimental
cases as well as three different approaches to DVV application. Although there are some
interesting research aspects in the paper I feel that there are still some important points that need
to be addressed by the authors in order for the paper to be published.
1. A previous reviewer suggests that the literature review could be enhanced with a
sufficient discussion of other methods, equivalent to DVV, used in order to quantify nonlinearity.
I think that the authors still need to consider this suggestion.
2. Figure 2b should be larger (and clearer if possible).
3. Page 17: “sudden change of stiffness was simulated by a sudden failure of the middle
springs on either side of…”. The authors should discuss a bit about how this sudden failure was
achieved.
4. At several points in the simulated and experimental analysis sections it seems that the
authors could attempt a more thorough discussion on the interpretation of the results they are
presenting. For example:
P.18: “In general Method 1 yields higher RMSE values than other approaches.”:what is the
explanation of this observation according to the authors?
P.21: ”The trend of the results obtained are the same but… between 0.128 and 0.142…”Why? Is
this difference considered to be big or small by the authors?
P.22: “The RMSE obtained for CH1 data are lower, while for LDV…” Explain why.
P.23: “The results of these experiments, in comparison with the ones…” the same..
5. It would be helpful if the authors presented for a couple of significant cases examined
the signals analysed. This would probably give better insight on the quantification attempted.
6. I find the definition of "nonlinear signals" confusing. Could it be that the authors are in fact
referring to nonstationary signals rather than "nonlinear"?

This revised manuscript describes a comprehensive investigation into use of the delay variance

I hereby acknowledge the significant effort made by the Authors to shorten the paper with
respect to the original version. However, additional efforts to improve the readability of the
paper are necessary. In particular, the organization of the sections presenting the numerical and
experimental results has to be rearranged. The results have to be located closer to the
corresponding discussion, avoiding a lengthy presentation of results and, thereafter, an equally
lengthy discussion. The number of investigated parameters is too large to easily remember them
and the presented results are too far from the related discussions: these circumstances make the
current organization of the manuscript inadequate. I also recommend to shorten the paper by
adding some tables to summarize relevant results, as in Section 4. A careful check of punctuation
and amendment of minor misprints are mandatory (see, for instance, pag. 7 line 10: “For each set
sets”…, or pag. 8 line 17: “Performing DVV analysis on the original and a number of surrogate
time series. DVV scatter diagram can characterize the linear…”).
Please, replace “generally vague, imprecise, uncertain or unknown” with “immeasurable [C.
Rainieri, G. Fabbrocino, Operational Modal Analysis of civil engineering structures: An
introduction and guide for applications, Springer, New York, 2014]” on pag. 2 line 18.
Please, clarify the sentence “monitoring of the dynamic responses is only remotely possible” on
pag. 4 line 18.
Please, clarify the definition of linear signal in Section 2. Does “linear shift-invariant system”
mean “linear time-invariant”? Does “given by Gaussian white noise” mean that the input to the
system is a Gaussian white noise? If so, according to the given definition of linear signal (pag. 5
lines 15-18) is the response of a linear time invariant system to a harmonic force non-linear?
Please, clarify.
Pag. 8 lines 14-22 show some repeated concepts. Please, reformulate the sentences to avoid
repetitions.
In Section 4 pag. 12, please add a summary of the investigated parameters after line 3. A similar
list is reported in the following Sections but it is missing here. Nevertheless, such a list is crucial
to improve the readability. In the current version, the investigated parameters can be recovered
only after a complete reading of the Section, and by the table (Table 1) reported at the end of the
Section.
Figure 1 shows only three points per curve, and they are often very distant each other. Please,
add some intermediate results.
Since the results in Section 4 show that the method is sensitive to damping variations, please add
some comments to better justify why the experimental results (Section 5, tests on the SDOF
system) are sometimes insensitive to the change of the surface roughness, which should instead
result in a variation of the damping ratio of the SDOF system.
Please, change the last sentence in the Conclusions as follows: “The application of the DVV
method on the recorded responses of the observed structural system can be useful for level 1
damage detection [A. Rytter, Vibration based inspection of civil engineering structures, PhD
dissertation, Aalborg University, Denmark, 1993] in the context of continuous SHM”.
Reference [1] is inappropriate and it should be replaced by the following: C. Farrar, K. Worden,
Structural health monitoring: a machine learning perspective, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., 2012.
The list of references at the end of the paper shows some outdated references (see, for instance,
Ref. [4] and [5]) and too many self-references (45% of the total number of references), some of
which can be definitely replaced by other state-of-the-art papers. For these reasons, I recommend
to replace Ref. [4], [5], [6] and [7] with the following references:

This revised manuscript describes a comprehensive investigation into use of the delay variance
method for quantification of the nonlinearity of dynamic responses of a single degree of freedom
structure and a composite wind turbine blade. The authors have addressed the substantive issue
concerning the length of the manuscript, and through making the text more concise have
concentrated its message. The scientific message of the paper is fine and the text readable.
I am therefore prepared to recommend publication, with very minor revision (see below).

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper deals with an extensive investigation about the opportunities given by the DVV
method for detection of signal non-linearities in the context of SHM applications.
I hereby acknowledge the significant effort made by the Authors to shorten the paper with
respect to the original version. However, additional efforts to improve the readability of the
paper are necessary. In particular, the organization of the sections presenting the numerical and
experimental results has to be rearranged. The results have to be located closer to the
corresponding discussion, avoiding a lengthy presentation of results and, thereafter, an equally
lengthy discussion. The number of investigated parameters is too large to easily remember them
and the presented results are too far from the related discussions: these circumstances make the
current organization of the manuscript inadequate. I also recommend to shorten the paper by
adding some tables to summarize relevant results, as in Section 4. A careful check of punctuation
and amendment of minor misprints are mandatory (see, for instance, pag. 7 line 10: “For each set
sets”…, or pag. 8 line 17: “Performing DVV analysis on the original and a number of surrogate
time series. DVV scatter diagram can characterize the linear…”).

Please, replace “generally vague, imprecise, uncertain or unknown” with “immeasurable [C.
Rainieri, G. Fabbrocino, Operational Modal Analysis of civil engineering structures: An
introduction and guide for applications, Springer, New York, 2014]” on pag. 2 line 18.
Please, clarify the sentence “monitoring of the dynamic responses is only remotely possible” on
pag. 4 line 18.
Please, clarify the definition of linear signal in Section 2. Does “linear shift-invariant system”
mean “linear time-invariant”? Does “given by Gaussian white noise” mean that the input to the
system is a Gaussian white noise? If so, according to the given definition of linear signal (pag. 5
lines 15-18) is the response of a linear time invariant system to a harmonic force non-linear?
Please, clarify.
Pag. 8 lines 14-22 show some repeated concepts. Please, reformulate the sentences to avoid
repetitions.
In Section 4 pag. 12, please add a summary of the investigated parameters after line 3. A similar
list is reported in the following Sections but it is missing here. Nevertheless, such a list is crucial
to improve the readability. In the current version, the investigated parameters can be recovered
only after a complete reading of the Section, and by the table (Table 1) reported at the end of the
Section.
Figure 1 shows only three points per curve, and they are often very distant each other. Please,
add some intermediate results.
Since the results in Section 4 show that the method is sensitive to damping variations, please add
some comments to better justify why the experimental results (Section 5, tests on the SDOF
system) are sometimes insensitive to the change of the surface roughness, which should instead
result in a variation of the damping ratio of the SDOF system.
Please, change the last sentence in the Conclusions as follows: “The application of the DVV
method on the recorded responses of the observed structural system can be useful for level 1
damage detection [A. Rytter, Vibration based inspection of civil engineering structures, PhD
dissertation, Aalborg University, Denmark, 1993] in the context of continuous SHM”.
Reference [1] is inappropriate and it should be replaced by the following: C. Farrar, K. Worden,
Structural health monitoring: a machine learning perspective, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., 2012.
The list of references at the end of the paper shows some outdated references (see, for instance,
Ref. [4] and [5]) and too many self-references (45% of the total number of references), some of
which can be definitely replaced by other state-of-the-art papers. For these reasons, I recommend
to replace Ref. [4], [5], [6] and [7] with the following references:

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper examines the Delay Vector Variance (DVV) method as a means of assessing
nonlinearities in dynamical systems. The authors examine various simulated and experimental
cases as well as three different approaches to DVV application. Although there are some
interesting research aspects in the paper I feel that there are still some important points that need
to be addressed by the authors in order for the paper to be published.
15
1. A previous reviewer suggests that the literature review could be enhanced with a
sufficient discussion of other methods, equivalent to DVV, used in order to quantify nonlinearity.
I think that the authors still need to consider this suggestion.
2. Figure 2b should be larger (and clearer if possible).
3. Page 17: “sudden change of stiffness was simulated by a sudden failure of the middle
springs on either side of…”. The authors should discuss a bit about how this sudden failure was
achieved.
4. At several points in the simulated and experimental analysis sections it seems that the
authors could attempt a more thorough discussion on the interpretation of the results they are
presenting. For example:
P.18: “In general Method 1 yields higher RMSE values than other approaches.”:what is the
explanation of this observation according to the authors?
P.21: ”The trend of the results obtained are the same but… between 0.128 and 0.142…”Why? Is
this difference considered to be big or small by the authors?
P.22: “The RMSE obtained for CH1 data are lower, while for LDV…” Explain why.
P.23: “The results of these experiments, in comparison with the ones…” the same..
5. It would be helpful if the authors presented for a couple of significant cases examined
the signals analysed. This would probably give better insight on the quantification attempted.
6. I find the definition of "nonlinear signals" confusing. Could it be that the authors are in fact
referring to nonstationary signals rather than "nonlinear"?

Abstract: Although vibration monitoring is a popular method to monitor and assess dynamic
structures, quantification of linearity or nonlinearity of the dynamic responses remains a
challenging problem. We investigate the Delay Vector Variance (DVV) method in this regard in a
comprehensive fashion to establish the degree to which a change in signal nonlinearity can be
related to system nonlinearity and how a change in system parameters affects the nonlinearity in
the dynamic response of the system. A wide range of theoretical situations are considered in this
regard using a Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) system to obtain numerical benchmarks. A
number of experiments are then carried out using a physical SDOF model in the laboratory.
Finally, a composite Wind turbine blade (WTB) is tested for different excitations and the dynamic
responses are measured at a number of points to extend the investigation to continuum
structures. The dynamic responses were measured using accelerometers, strain gauges and a
16
Laser Doppler vibrometer. This comprehensive study creates a numerical and experimental
benchmark for structurally dynamical systems where output-only information is typically
available, especially in the context of DVV. The study also allows for comparative analysis
between different systems driven by the similar input.

Title: A Comprehensive Study of the Delay Vector Variance Method for Quantification of
Nonlinearity in Dynamical Systems
by V. Jaksic, D. P. Mandic, K. Ryan, B. Basu and V. Pakrashi
For publication in the Royal Society Open Source
The authors would like to thank the reviewers for the queries and constructive comments. We
believe that this gives us an opportunity to make the paper stronger.
The response to each comment is provided below.
Reviewer #1:
The paper deals with a statistical method to assess nonlinearities in time series. The results
of extensive investigations on simulated and real datasets are presented. The main
weaknesses of this manuscript are as follows:
1. The current version of the paper is lengthy and difficult to read. Some relevant
information to understand the context of the study are omitted (the definition of signal
nonlinearity is not given; only a reference is provided but this makes a proper
understanding of the paper difficult for the reader not familiar with this concept).
Results are presented in lengthy verbal form instead of clear tables and figures, in
particular for section 3 and, partially, section 4. A thorough review and
rearrangement of the structure of the paper to improve its readability and point out
the big lessons learned from the study in view of more general applications and not
only the results obtained from the various tests is mandatory.
The paper is now thoroughly revised and its length is significantly reduced as recommended
by reviewer, while enhancing the key message better. Some of the detailed results is now
provided in the form of an Electronic Supplementary Material and is marked as Appendices
n the revised submission. The definition of signal nonlinearity is given alongside the relevant
reference.
The results are now presented in figures and tables as appropriate. The length of the section 3
s reduced to include only the steps of the proposed methodology while detailed explanation
of the methodology is provided in appendices. Section 4 and 5 are now merged while the
engthy explanation on DVV parameter choice is moved to the corresponding appendix. The
summary tables and DVV results for each signal modelled/recorded are given in appendices
provided alongside with the text. The conclusions are given in more general manner
emphasizing on the take-home message.
2. The general context is not presented. Methods different from DVV are not considered,
even in the literature review. Spending some words to collocate the present study in
the context of the scientific literature on SHM is highly recommended. Otherwise,
SHM is mentioned in the manuscript without clear links with the presented study. The
opportunities of the method for vibration based SHM have to be clearly defined.
The comparison and analysis of performance of DVV method and several other established
nonlinearity analysis methods are presented in the Introduction section of the manuscript.
Regarding the links of SHM and presented study, the manuscript is amended to reflect the
connection between proposed method and SHM which has been supported with literature.
3. The aim of the study is to analyze the output of the method in view of applications
where output-only information is available. However, it considers both deterministic
and random inputs. The reasons should be clarified in light of the technical literature
about vibration based SHM based on output-only measurements.
In most cases of a real-life structure we do not know the nature and the intensity of excitation
forces (or the excitation is vaguely known with large uncertainty and is not useful for
analysis). This goes beyond traditional structures like buildings and bridges and is
particularly important for the new types of complex structures exposed to extreme weather
conditions, such as wind turbines (both onshore and offshore) and tidal turbine support
structures. Additionally, this difficulty is also related to all types of structures which change
heir type of loading or a system characteristic (e.g. stiffness) over time.
The reason for considering deterministic and random inputs is given in the Section 1
Introduction along with the relevant literature.
“Recently, DVV is applied and tested in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of
he offshore floating foundations [1-3], which are big dynamical systems which, due to their
geometry and material complexity, are hard to model since many parameters influence their
behaviour. Furthermore, the nature of excitation force, e.g deterministic or random, to this
systems is in reality unknown and monitoring of its response is only remotely possible. While
onsite structural inspections are limited due to weather conditions, understanding the
behaviour of these platforms in extreme weather situations is crucial for their operation.”
4. On pag. 7 it is stated that the number of surrogates in simulations is equal to 25,
while in the quoted reference (Ref. [5]) it is 99. The authors should clarify the reason
behind the choice of a value of Ns much lower than that reported in similar studies in
the literature.
The quoted reference, Gautama et al. [4], is the first study that launched DVV as competitive
method for nonlinearity testing. Therefore, the aim was to show the depth and detail of
research by using Ns = 99 surrogates, for every original time series, to perform nonlinearity
ests. However, the study is conveniently performed by choosing time lag and embedded
parameters constant on approximately 20 sample signals. In the earlier study on the optimal
embedding parameters, Gautama et al. [5] adopted Ns = 5 surrogates, while varying
embedded parameter from 2 to 15 and time lag from 1 to 10. They showed that increasing the
number of surrogates does not affect the results to any significant extent within the range of
study. Hongying and Fuliang [6] tested a fault in a diesel engine which was successfully
detected using DVV. They performed the analysis using constant embedded parameters
(m=2) on Ns=19 surrogates. Schreiber and Schmitz [7] also used Ns=19 surrogates for their
heory on improved surrogate data for nonlinearity tests. Kuntamalla and Reddy [8] analysed
he effect of aging on nonlinearity and stochastic nature of heart rate variability using Ns=25
sets of surrogates where embedded parameter was set to m=5 and time lag to 1. The authors
of the DVV method also use Ns=25 surogates sets for analysis of meteorological data given
n their malab toolbox [9]. Andrzejak et al [10], and Gautama et al [11] generated 39
surrogates for nonlinearity analysis. Therefore, it could be concluded from above and it is
observed by authors that the number of surrogates do not significantly affect the results of
DVV method within the range discussed. However, the important issues for an appropriate
DVV implementation are - if the surrogates are correctly calculated and tested [12-14], if the
signal measured has sufficient number of points measured [14] and if embedded dimension,
ime lag, span over which to perform DVV analysis, and minimum DV’s required are
properly set [15-18]. In simulations performed by Gautama et al. [4] typically 50 iterations
for a time series of 1000 samples were considered, while for surrogates related to the Lorenz
series, the method was shown to converge after 25 iterations.
In this study the authors used three different principles for obtaining the embedded
parameters, of which only one method had fixed time lag and embedded parameter while in
other two cases they varied, i.e. for m=2,..10 and t = 1,…10 and for m=1,..25 and t = 1.
There are numerous simulations/combinations done to confirm that the number of the
surrogates is adequate, i.e. several hundred signals (some with over fifty-thousand recorded
points) were analysed and for each 25 surrogates were generated for each set of embedded
parameters (section on parameter choice). All results are given in Appendix section. Hence,
found that from computational point the reasonable number of surrogates is 20 to 25 when
he embedded parameters vary. Therefore authors used the same number of 25 surrogates in
all three cases for consistency in order to make the same base for comparison of the
approaches considered.
5. How the values of driving frequency and natural frequency for the case of harmonic
load imposed on undamped SDOF system are selected? Please, explain.
The parameters for the response studies of undamped SDOF system excited by harmonic
oading are based on [19]. The modelled SDOF system is an idealisation but the study is
mportant from the perspective of benchmarking, where the system input is controlled/known
and its response calculated accordingly. The response signal was tested for the change in
nonlinearity due to the change of its input parameters in order to describe the trend and
sensitivity of system response, but also to test capability of DVV method to detect this
changes.
6. At lines 4-6 on pag. 22 it is stated that "Method 3 shows a consistent trend" but only
two points are considered (at frequencies 3 Hz and 12 Hz). How the "consistent
trend" has been identified? Please, explain or amend.
The manuscript is now corrected to reflect the results shown in corresponding figure (Figure
6).
“For resonance, the driving and natural frequencies are set equal (3, 12 and 22 Hz
respectively). RMSE calculated using only Method 3 shows a consistent trend, i.e. with
ncreasing frequency it increases from 0.119 to 0.165 for frequencies 3 and 22 Hz,
respectively.”
7. On pag. 25 line 22 it is stated that the response of the "SDOF system excited by
random vibration" is analyzed. However, the next lines clarify that the system is
actually excited by a harmonic input, whose amplitude is a random variable. The
frequency of the input force is 3.5 Hz. Random signals are very different from the one
considered in this case. This is not a secondary aspect. Clarifications are mandatory.
Consider that vibration based SHM makes large use of the random response of
structures. Evaluation of the performance of the method in the presence of actually
random signals is critical to assess the potentialities of the method for real-life
applications.
The authors agree with the reviewer that vibration based SHM makes large use of the
response of the structure excited by random vibration, which is exactly the driving force for
his study. The authors started with the idea of modelling the well-known SDOF system
excited by different forces in order to calculate its responses and determine the benchmark
(degree of nonlinearity of response signal) of the system behaviour. However, for different
types of input forces there is different level of complexity involved when calculating its
responses. Also, the computational platform imposes some constrains when it comes to the
modelling of random vibrations [19-21]. Therefore we focused on probabilistic modelling of
forces in vibrating system based on work by Kuchnicki et al. [19]. They showed how a
computational platform (they used Matlab for this purpose) can be used as an aid in
modelling random processes and how it can help in visualizing the response of systems
subjected to random forcing (limited to random forcing of deterministic systems). In order to
demonstrate some of the challenges imposed by a random forcing input the sinusoidal force
nput is chosen. The first step would be to determine how to introduce the randomness to this
system. There are few possibilities: to introduce a random force amplitude, a random
frequency, or both. When the power density of the typical input is derived in given physical
system it is observed that the majority of the energy input to the system comes at one
particular frequency. Therefore in this study we treated the forcing frequency as deterministic
(first approximation, see Appendix section) and used a random distribution for the amplitude.
Also we could use a random phase angle associated with this forcing. However, the random
phase angle is omitted for the simplicity of analysis. The next step was to determine which
probability density function for the input force amplitude to use, i.e. a uniform distribution, a
Gaussian distribution, or of some other description [20]. The random numbers are actually
pseudo-random as they depend on the initial state vector.
Therefore we looked at the damped SDOF system defined by equation A.1.68; where F(t) is
aken sinusoidal with a random amplitude A(t). It is solved for the steady-state response only,
neglecting the transient response. The solution is given in the Appendix: Reference Model
and Simple Vibration Problems, on pages 31 to 33.
For solving this equation it was convenient to apply the condition of ergodicity to the system.
Hence, we solved it for the steady-state response only, neglecting the transient response,
which eliminates the need to specify initial conditions. There are two ways to solve the
steady-state response; by using the results of the analysis presented in Appendix, giving an
analytic solution, or using the numerical integration routines (done here). In this case the
function for argument input is used to allow any number of input parameters from zero to a
maximum of five and the amplitude vector is set to be the same as the length of the time span
vector. This is done to make interpolation of amplitude based on values of time simpler. In
order to ensure that the amplitude is always greater than zero, each element of amplitude
vector is multiplied by its sign. This leads to a distribution that is not rigorously Gaussian.
However, we need to remove the transient response since the position and velocity imparted
by the forcing function at time zero are not necessarily zero. For this case the differential
equation is solved at time t0; and then substituted into the relation the values of the forcing
and the forced response at that time, to solve for the initial position and velocity required to
match the forced response. The solution to the problem, defined in the relevant Appendix is
hen coded in Matlab, by using the initial value of the force amplitude in the random array.
The time derivative of the randomly-varying amplitude is neglected in first approximation.
The oscillation remains periodic even with the random forcing amplitude. The figure below
llustrates the variation in amplitude and force for two cases observed.

8. Please, amend the sentence at lines 7-8 on pag. 7: "By using iAAFT method instead of
an iterative AAFT...". The method is actually the same. There is probably a misprint.
The sentence is now amended:
“By using iAAFT method instead of an Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (AAFT)
method the possibility of false rejections of null hypothesis is avoided and computational
efficiency is achieved.”
9. Please, amend the sentence at lines 14-17 on pag. 14. It suddenly end with "the".
The sentence is now amended:
“The optimal m, and time lag, t, are simultaneously determined based on estimates of the
differential entropy ratio of the phase space representation of a sampled time signal and an
ensemble of its surrogates.”
Reviewer #2:
This manuscript describes a very thorough investigation into the use of the delay variance
method for quantification of the nonlinearity of dynamic responses of a single degree of
reedom structure and a composite wind turbine blade. Useful experimental data are
presented. The manuscript provides a particularly detailed explanation of the theory behind
he delay vector variance method, the choice of embedding parameters, the dynamic response
of a single-degree-of-freedom system in terms of root-mean-square-error, the application to a
car, and results from a set of wind turbine blade experiments.
The manuscript does describe original research in engineering, and the results do not appear
o have been published elsewhere. The conclusions are in accordance with the data. The
work is ethical, with the experiments and analysis performed to scientifically and
methodologically high standard. My main concern is that the manuscript is overlong, and its
sheer length obscures the advances in scientific knowledge contained within.
Overall, the manuscript is quite readable in the style of a technical report, and covers a topic
hat is appropriate for readers of RSOS. Unfortunately, the text is far too long, with too
many figures (many of which are Excel plots). The manuscript is over 100 pages long! In
short, the science appears fine, but the manuscript requires considerable editing to
concentrate its message and bring it up to journal standard.
My recommendation is for the manuscript to be declined for publication at this stage, but the
authors encouraged to resubmit a much more compact paper (say half or one-third the
ength) for re-review, with relevant data made available through Appendices or a hyperlink
o the more detailed report.
The manuscript is amended and its length reduced as recommended by reviewer. The
horough description of methodology and DVV parameter study is placed in appendices
provided alongside of the manuscript. Please note that the last pages of the revised
manuscript are dedicated to single figures re-reproduced for possible typesetting (or similar)
purposes. The revised paper is half the length of the original paper. The Appendices, as
Electronic Supplemeentary Material are more extensive now as compared to the original
submission.
Reviewer #3:
The paper investigates the capabilities of a relatively recent method, the delay vector
variance, concerning the quantification of nonlinearity in dynamical systems. The authors
attempt to create a benchmark for the use of the method for different structural dynamics
systems with different excitations and parameters. A significant number of simulation and
experimental results are presented in order to achieve this. The paper is generally easy to
understand, although I have a concern about its length.
1. Maybe sections 4 and 5 of the paper should be condensed in one (since they both give
results for a big number of different simulations), and in that case it would be nice if
the authors tried to explain a bit more thoroughly the motivation behind the simulated
studies presented and give a summary of the conclusions driven by these simulations
in order to then continue with verifying these results on the experimental case. It is for
this reason (the need of change in the structure of the paper) that I suggest major
corrections.
The manuscript is amended and section 4 and 5 are merged in one. The explanation behind
simulation is given and summary of conclusions related to the modelled vibration problems
isted. Also, some section of the main body of the manuscript, such as the consideration of
he DVV parameters is now moved in Appendix section in order to reduce the manuscript
ength.
2. Another remark that I have is that although numerous cases are examined, I feel that
there could be some discussion added on the kind of nonlinearities that exist in some
of these cases. For example in Figure 1b: what kind of nonlinearity exists in this
case? It would be nice if the authors gave a brief description of the nonlinear
characteristics chosen here and maybe a short discussion, at that point, of what is
expected from the method for the different kinds of nonlinearities that a SDOF system
could have. This also applies to section 5, where it might be good if the authors gave
the exact equations of motion used in their simulation.
DVV method does not deal with the type of nonlinearities of the system but the degree of
nonlinearity of the recorded signal [15]. Hence, it clarifies if one signal is more or less linear
n comparison to the other. In particular case of Figure 1, the example is randomly picked out
from the numerous simulations shown in the appendices, provided alongside of this paper, to
llustrate the methodology. Figure 1b shows the signal measured is more nonlinear in
comparison with the one shown in figure 1a. The authors provided all DVV simulations and
equations related to the SDOF models considered in appendices. The type of excitation force
mposed by table shaker and measured response plots with DVV analysis of the SDOF
experiments are also provided in corresponding appendix. However, the expectation of the
system response analysed by DVV was not known prior to this research. Therefore, it
presented the motivation and challenge for this comprehensive study.
The advantage of this approach is that the level of nonlinearity change in response signal
could be determined without knowledge of underlying system or process. Therefore, the
motivation behind this research is possibility to detect the change within the system by
monitoring output only signals (structural responses) without any prior knowledge on the
system or its excitation force nature. The sections 3 and 4 of the manuscript deal with the
‘simply’ mechanical problems in order to establish the degree of sensibility of the DVV
method to various parameter change. Namely, the changes in stiffness, mass, natural
frequency, etc. are often indicators of structural damage. Vibration monitoring is one of the
ways to monitor the structure health. In reality, the structural systems are often massive and
complex (bridges, dams, supporting structures for the wind and tidal energy devices, etc) and
cannot be described using the mathematical means. Moreover, the complexity of their loading
is hard to formulate (e.g. extreme loading). Also, during the structural life the nature and
ntensity of their loading changes (e.g. many bridges constructed with in the Europe are over
50 years old yet they experience the traffic loading they were not designed for originally
[22]).
The authors revised the manuscript to include the above clarifications.
3. Finally, in the conclusions section the authors end the manuscript with the sentence:
“ The application of DVV method on recorded responses of the observed structural
system can be useful in the initial continuous online SHM monitoring”. Although, I
can understand why the authors make this statement according to the results they
present and the potential of the method it would be nice if this was a bit further
discussed not only in the conclusions section but also in the introduction of the
manuscript (with the explanation that damage introduces nonlinearity to the
system..).
The Introduction and Conclusion sections are revised now to reflect the connection between
proposed methodology and Structural Health Monitoring as advised by the reviewer.

For publication in the Royal Society Open Source
The authors would like to thank the reviewers for the queries and constructive comments. We
believe that this gives us an opportunity to make the paper stronger.
The response to each comment is provided below.
Reviewer # 2:
This revised manuscript describes a comprehensive investigation into use of the delay
variance method for quantification of the nonlinearity of dynamic responses of a single
degree of freedom structure and a composite wind turbine blade. The authors have
addressed the substantive issue concerning the length of the manuscript, and through making
he text more concise have concentrated its message. The scientific message of the paper is
ine and the text readable.
I am therefore prepared to recommend publication, with very minor revision (see below).

The suggested changes are now introduced in the paper as per reviewer’s advice.
Reviewer # 1:
The paper deals with an extensive investigation about the opportunities given by the DVV
method for detection of signal non-linearities in the context of SHM applications.
1. I hereby acknowledge the significant effort made by the Authors to shorten the paper
with respect to the original version. However, additional efforts to improve the
readability of the paper are necessary. In particular, the organization of the sections
presenting the numerical and experimental results has to be rearranged. The results
have to be located closer to the corresponding discussion, avoiding a lengthy
presentation of results and, thereafter, an equally lengthy discussion. The number of
investigated parameters is too large to easily remember them and the presented
results are too far from the related discussions: these circumstances make the current
organization of the manuscript inadequate.
The text and figures within have been rearranged now.
2. I also recommend to shorten the paper by adding some tables to summarize relevant
results, as in Section 4. A careful check of punctuation and amendment of minor
misprints are mandatory (see, for instance, pag. 7 line 10: “For each set sets”…, or
pag. 8 line 17: “Performing DVV analysis on the original and a number of surrogate
time series. DVV scatter diagram can characterize the linear…”).
The results are presented in the tables within the figures for easy comparison and are omitted
from the text as per suggestion to the extent that it does not interfere with the main message.
Tables with the relevant results are now included in the text.
Text is checked and corrected.
3. Please, replace “generally vague, imprecise, uncertain or unknown” with
“immeasurable [C. Rainieri, G. Fabbrocino, Operational Modal Analysis of civil
engineering structures: An introduction and guide for applications, Springer, New
York, 2014]”
The text is now amended and reference added.
4. on pag. 2 line 18.Please, clarify the sentence “monitoring of the dynamic responses is
only remotely possible”
The sentence is now completed with explanation:
“Furthermore, the nature of excitation force, e.g. deterministic or random, to these systems is
n reality unknown and monitoring of the dynamic responses is only remotely possible, e.g.
because of the structure’s difficult accessibility, interruption to its operation, etc.”
5. on pag. 4 line 18.Please, clarify the definition of linear signal
The definition of linear signal is now clarified.
The signal and system nonlinearity is defined as per Schreiber and Kanz, 2005 and Gautama
et al. [1, 2], i.e. a linear signal, x, is generally defined as the output of a linear shift-invariant
system that is driven by Gaussian white noise [3]. However, in most cases, this definition is
somewhat relaxed by allowing the probability distribution of the signal values, i.e. the signal
distribution, to deviate from the Gaussian one. This can be interpreted as a linear signal
(following the strict definition) measured by a static (possibly nonlinear) observation function
[1].”
The detail explanation, supported by references is given in Appendix 1 so that the manuscript
remain within required length.
6. in Section 2. Does “linear shift-invariant system” mean “linear time-invariant”?
Yes. Shift invariant system can be described as discrete equivalent of a time-invariant system
[4]. A dynamic system is time-invariant if shifting the input on the time axis leads to an
equivalent shifting of the output along the time axis, with no other changes. In other words, a
ime invariant system maps a given input trajectory u(t) no matter when it occurs:
y(t - t ) = F[u(t - t )]
The formula above specifies that if an input signal is delayed by some amount t, so will be
he output, and with no other changes.
In the context of time series the meaning is identical. The notion of shift-invariant is,
however, wider as it also covers spatial arrangements of samples for which the time
dimension may be fixed. The main relevance to this work is that we cannot talk about signal
inearity/nonlinearity without the assumption of shift-invariance.
7. Does “given by Gaussian white noise” mean that the input to the system is a
Gaussian white noise?
Yes. The standard definition of a linear signal is that it is generated by a Gaussian linear
stochastic process. While, nonlinear signal is generally defined as the signal generated by the
system that does not obey superposition and scaling properties [3]. In this contest, a shift-
nvariant system is a system that input-output relationship does not vary with the time such
hat: y(n) is response of the system to input x(n), for time lag/delay t, so that the response of
he system to input x(n-t) will be y(n-t).
If so, according to the given definition of linear signal (pag. 5 lines 15-18) is the
response of a linear time invariant system to a harmonic force non-linear? Please,
clarify.
Yes, if the response does not obey superposition and scaling properties (see Appendix 2 and
3) then it will be indicated that the signal is non-linear, given the information that we only
have the output and have no information regarding the system and the input. One of the
practical ways to avoid such a (obvious) mismatch is by creating a comprehensive
repository/numerical study like this submission so that the shape of the RMSE plot leads to a
better assessment of the system. Mapping the shape to a single meaningful number is
currently very difficult and would remain as an important problem to take up. On the other
hand, another situation can occur when we enter a limit-cycle situation where even with the
shape it can be difficult to distinguish between a strong nonlinearity in system versus a
system that is linear. A lot of methods fall flat under these circumstances, but it is possible to
probe the system with some broadband components, rather than a harmonic under those
circumstances and then it is possible to distinguish them. Sinusoidal fidelity is a given for
ime invariant systems but we are considering no information available and only the outputs
present.
8. Pag. 8 lines 14-22 show some repeated concepts. Please, reformulate the sentences to
avoid repetitions.
The text is now amended.
9. In Section 4 pag. 12, please add a summary of the investigated parameters after line
3. A similar list is reported in the following Sections but it is missing here.
Nevertheless, such a list is crucial to improve the readability. In the current version,
the investigated parameters can be recovered only after a complete reading of the
Section, and by the table (Table 1) reported at the end of the Section.
The text is now amended.
“The degree of nonlinearity of different SDOF systems response was observed for variation
n following parameters: system mass, damping, driving frequency, natural frequency, and
nput force magnitude.”
10. Figure 1 shows only three points per curve, and they are often very distant each
other. Please, add some intermediate results.
Figure 1 is now amended, i.e. some intermediate results are added.
11. Since the results in Section 4 show that the method is sensitive to damping variations,
please add some comments to better justify why the experimental results (Section 5,
tests on the SDOF system) are sometimes insensitive to the change of the surface
roughness, which should instead result in a variation of the damping ratio of the
SDOF system.
The explanation is now included in the paper.
The results shown in Figure 1 (section 4) shows that the degree of linearity of recorded
response of SDOF system exposed to free damped oscillations increases with the increase in
damping. However, the results of the SDOF experiments are sometime insensitive to change
n surface roughness which should result in variation in damping ratio of the system. The
reason for this is that the friction in the main oscillation direction between the wheels of the
SDOF car and the surface was low enough to be neglected. However, the difference in
surface roughness is better detected with the lateral car movement as friction between the car
wheels and surfaces is more prominent.
12. Please, change the last sentence in the Conclusions as follows: “The application of
the DVV method on the recorded responses of the observed structural system can be
useful for level 1 damage detection [A. Rytter, Vibration based inspection of civil
engineering structures, PhD dissertation, Aalborg University, Denmark, 1993] in the
context of continuous SHM”.
The text is amended now and reference added.
13. Reference [1] is inappropriate and it should be replaced by the following: C. Farrar,
K. Worden, Structural health monitoring: a machine learning perspective, John Wiley
and Sons Ltd., 2012.
The reference is replaced now.
14. The list of references at the end of the paper shows some outdated references (see, for
instance, Ref. [4] and [5]) and too many self-references (45% of the total number of
references), some of which can be definitely replaced by other state-of-the-art papers.
For these reasons, I recommend to replace Ref. [4], [5], [6] and [7] with the
following references:

Reviewer # 3:
The paper examines the Delay Vector Variance (DVV) method as a means of assessing
nonlinearities in dynamical systems. The authors examine various simulated and
experimental cases as well as three different approaches to DVV application. Although there
are some interesting research aspects in the paper I feel that there are still some important
points that need to be addressed by the authors in order for the paper to be published.
1. A previous reviewer suggests that the literature review could be enhanced with a
sufficient discussion of other methods, equivalent to DVV, used in order to quantify
nonlinearity. I think that the authors still need to consider this suggestion.
Introduction section, paragraph 2, quotes the reference that gives the overview of several
establish nonlinearity analysis methods and compares them to DVV method [5]. Namely, the
study gives the analysis of:
- Deterministic versus stochastic plots (DVS) proposed by Casdagli [6]. However, the
DVS method does not allow for a quantitative analysis.
- Traditional nonlinearity metrics which have been used in [7], i.e. the third-order
autocovariance (C3) and a measure of the deviation due to time reversibility (REV).
In combination with the surrogate data strategy, both measures yield two-tailed tests
for nonlinearity.
- The d–<U+0454> method proposed by Kaplan [8] which has been used in combination with the
surrogate data strategy for examining the linear or nonlinear nature of a time series
[9].
However, a unified analysis of the predictability and the degree of nonlinearity remains an
open issue.
DVV method presents analysis of a time series which examines the predictability of a time
series by virtue of the observation of the variability of the targets. The method is most similar
o Kaplan’s d–<U+0454> method and the false nearest neighbours [10].
The comparison of above listed nonlinearity methods (DVS method is excluded since it does
not allow for a quantitative analysis) with DVV showed that in absence of noise only d–<U+0454>
method and DVV method detected nonlinearities for slopes exceeding 1.5. When noise was
added to the driving signals, the time reversal metric (REV) was able to detect the nonlinear
nature for high slopes, but the d–<U+0454> method failed. The third-order cumulant (C3) was unable
o detect nonlinearities in this type of signals. Only the DVV method consistently detected
nonlinear behaviour for higher slopes and for all noise levels.
In recent literature, there is research on signal linearity analysis based on surrogate data [11]
such as investigation of deterministic chaos [12], irregular fluctuations with long-term trends
[13] investigating linear and nonlinear Gaussian processes in time series, irrespective of the
presence of nonstationary behaviour [14].
The advance technique for nonlinear data analysis is a recurrence plot (RP). It is a graph of a
square matrix, in which the matrix elements correspond to those times at which a state of a
dynamical system recurs, i.e. visualise the dynamics of phase space trajectories [15]. By
using the Takens’ embedding theorem [16],for a given univariate time series x(n), the phase
space can be reconstructed by embedding the time seriea. A time series x(n) is considered
deterministic if its trajectory in the phase space is smooth and can be modelled as a
continuous function. This results in an RP matrix where almost every state is recurrent and
forms long diagonal lines, where the DET value is close to unity. Else, if a time series is
stochastic, the DET values are near zero. The intermediate case corresponds to a signal which
comprises both deterministic and stochastic components.
However, the RP are testing only for determinism and are sensitive for summation. While RP
are testing only for deterministic-stochasyic behaviour, DVV is testing deterministic-
stochastic and linear-nonlinear.
In order to keep the paper within by reviewers suggested length, the short version of the
above explanation is now included in the manuscript (Section 1, paragraph 1 & 2) for
completeness.
2. Figure 2b should be larger (and clearer if possible).
Figure 2b is now enlarged and improved.
3. Page 17: “sudden change of stiffness was simulated by a sudden failure of the middle
springs on either side of…”. The authors should discuss a bit about how this sudden
failure was achieved.
The text in section 5.1 is now amended to explain the sudden change of stiffness during
experiment.
“In one of the experiments, the sudden change of stiffness was simulated by a sudden failure
of the middle springs on either side during vibration measurements. For this experiment only
he middle springs were attached to rigid support with adhesive with a lower strength in order
o simulate the spring failure/sudden stiffness change.”
However, the timing of designed failure of the springs and stiffness reduction is given in
Section 5.2 (page 30) for better interpretation of results.
4. At several points in the simulated and experimental analysis sections it seems that the
authors could attempt a more thorough discussion on the interpretation of the results
they are presenting. For example:
P.18: “In general Method 1 yields higher RMSE values than other approaches.”:
what is the explanation of this observation according to the authors?
The text is now completed with explanation.
“In general Method 1 yields higher RMSE values than other approaches. This might be due to
he segmentation of the signal which lead to different parameter choice for each section of the
signal. Also, the parameter choice is not always within reasonable limits using this method
[1].”
P.21: ”The trend of the results obtained are the same but… between 0.128 and
0.142…”Why? Is this difference considered to be big or small by the authors?
The text is now rephrased to better reflect relation of the results obtained on different surfaces
using different measuring devices.
“RMSE of recorded responses by both instruments is consistent, i.e. being higher for sand
paper and lower for wood surface. However, accelerometer measurements appear to be more
sensitive to surface change since the difference in the degree of nonlinearity is higher than for
LDV measurements. This is might be, above all due to the sampling frequency of the
accelerometer and the LDV which were 128 Hz and 830 Hz, respectively and to less extent
due to possible amplification of errors during differentiation process being applied on LDV
velocity measurements when obtaining the acceleration.”
P.22: “The RMSE obtained for CH1 data are lower, while for LDV…” Explain why.
The explanation is included in the paper now:
“The results show that accelerometer measurements are more sensitive to stiffness change
han LDV, i.e. RMSE is higher for CH1. The reason being using the higher sampling
frequency and differentiation of velocity measured with LDV in order to obtain acceleration
which tends to amplify any errors when adjacent data points are quite similar in size as it was
a case here.”
P.23: “The results of these experiments, in comparison with the ones…” the same..
The explanation is included in the paper now:
“Again, this could be attributed to error accumulated due to differentiation method being
applied on LDV velocity measurements.”
Please note that the differentiation was considered since there is no benchmarking of LDV
data till date for dynamic systems and even its manufacturers consider accelerometers to be
he closest competitor and for comparison of accuracy, use hi specification accelerometer
data to be the primary data.
5. It would be helpful if the authors presented for a couple of significant cases examined
the signals analysed. This would probably give better insight on the quantification
attempted.
The main criticism of the paper (in this and previous review) was the length of the paper. We
were advised to shorten the paper and reduce the number of figures. For that reason all
simulated and measured signals along with DVV analysis performed are given in:
Appendix3: Delay Vector Variance Method Results for Reference Model & Discussion on
DVV Parameters Choice
Appendix4: Delay Vector Variance Method SDOF Car Experiment Results
Appendix5: Delay Vector Variance Method WTB Experiment Results
6. I find the definition of "nonlinear signals" confusing. Could it be that the authors are
in fact referring to nonstationary signals rather than "nonlinear"?
The standard definition of a linear signal is that it is generated by a Gaussian linear stochastic
process. The delay vector variance (DVV) method [2] is a phase space based technique
which examines the deterministic versus stochastic nature of a time series, and when
combined with the method of surrogate data [2], it also provides information
about the linear versus nonlinear behaviour. Most statistical signal nonlinearity analyses,
ncluding the surrogate data method, are based on the Monte-Carlo approach [17], whereby
an ensemble of surrogate data is constructed to represent linearised versions of the original
data. A statistical measure (test statistics) is then computed for both the original time series
and the surrogates; if these are significantly different, the data at hand are deemed not to be
generated by a linear process. Since surrogate data require stationarity in the original signal,
nonstationarity can be mistaken by nonlinearity in this class of methods. The reason authors
retain the term ‘nonlinear signals’ in terms of this current definition is also related to the fact
hat the technique itself is well established and the entire body of literature refer back to and
currently refer to all such approaches as per this term.
