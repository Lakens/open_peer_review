The authors tested whether pigeons react differently when attacked by dark vs. light
sparrowhawk (a colour polymorphic species) under different light conditions. They found that
pigeons indeed react different if light conditions are dark or light but not in intereaction with
sparrowhawk plumage coloration. This is contrary to their prediction.
I quite liked the study and recommend publication. I just wonder whether pigeons are really
attacked by these sparrowhawks? And if yes, how frequently are pigeons captured by
sparrowhawks? Maybe it could worth using other prey species. And I wonder whether the
experimental design is appropriate given that detection time could be measured in only 9.5% of
the times?
Even if the authors did not find an effect as expected, I believe that this paper is a useful
contribution.

This interesting study investigates whether feral pigeons detect the dark or bright morph of the
black sparrow hawk faster, under different conditions, and thus, whether earlier observed
differences in hunting behavior and success of the two morphs may result from prey behavior.
The study is mostly well-done and has clearly described results.

1. My main problem relates to terminology and measurements of light condition. No reader can
have any idea what a “dull light condition” could mean. So here the reader needs to know the
light intensity: The easiest way is to say whether this means light conditions on a cloudy day (5 to
100 times dimmer than a sunny day), in a light (10 x dimmer) or thick (upo to 1000 times dimmer)
forest, or maybe early or late dusk (which includes a huge range of light intensities). In addition,
light measurements are useful, either in human-defined IS units (lux or Candela), but possibly
even in spectral data, specifically when working indoors, where light spectra often are completely
different to natural spectra. For instance, does the light have a UV component or not? Chickens
have different flicker fusion frequency with and without UV, and it is not known whether the
same applies to pigeons.
2. The second part of this problem relates to the description of the background and predator
dummy intensities. These are not given anywhere. The most relevant information would be a
measurement (if these are reasonably close to the black-grey-white colour range this could be
done with a candelameter that measures the light reflected from a defined area into a defined
angle (Cd/m2) of the predator dummy and the background, from the direction of the pigeon. The
contrast between these two measurements is telling you whether indeed the dark morph had
lower contrast against the black background and the bright morph, against the white
background. From the very nice sketch of the set-up, I am not sure this really is the case. It all
depends on the illumination conditions, so it needs to be measured. It is important because it
allows you to answer the question whether the the behavior of the pigeons did not differ, simply
because contrasts were not different, or whether the contrasts really differed but the pigeons did
not care.
Handheld instruments that can measure this are not very expensive and they are quite common.
Terms like dark and bright are far too unspecific to be used in the context of such studies, unless
they come with a measurement.
3. I am a bit disappointed that the authors missed a very similar case of colour dimorphism, in
barn owls, which have a white and a dark morph as well. A lot of work has been done on that
system, mostly by the group of Alexandre Roulin. A short discussion on this very similar case
would bring a more general perspective to the problem and thus make this paper more
interesting to general readers.
Other than these easily fixed points, I think the study is very solid.

ite liked the study and recommend publication. I just wonder whether pigeons are really
cked by these sparrowhawks? And if yes, how frequently are pigeons captured by
rrowhawks? Maybe it could worth using other prey species.
nk you for this question: Black sparrowhawks are almost exclusively bird hunters and their
n prey items are pigeons and doves. Prey analyses in our study population have shown that
ut 28 % of all prey items brought to the nest are feral pigeons. We have now added some
to explain this in Material and Methods:
ck sparrowhawks are regularly prey on feral pigeons in our study area and analysis of prey
ains have shown that about 28 % of all prey items recorded are feral pigeons (Suri et al.
7, Ibis 159:38-54) .”
I wonder whether the experimental design is appropriate given that detection time could be
asured in only 9.5% of the times?
pears there has been some misunderstanding here.
original text in the paper says “In 9.5% of all trials, we were unable to measure a detection
, because the pigeon was already looking directly in the direction of the on-coming hawk or
not notice the hawk.”
s, it is not the case that detection time was measured in only 9.5% of cases, but rather that
could NOT measure it in 9.5% of cases.
he hope of avoiding any similar confusion in the future, we have now altered the text to read:
were unable to measure reaction time in 9.5 % of all trials, because the pigeon was already
ing directly in the direction of the on-coming hawk or did not notice it.”

y main problem relates to terminology and measurements of light condition. No reader can
e any idea what a “dull light condition” could mean. So here the reader needs to know the
t intensity: The easiest way is to say whether this means light conditions on a cloudy day (5
00 times dimmer than a sunny day), in a light (10 x dimmer) or thick (upo to 1000 times
mer) forest, or maybe early or late dusk (which includes a huge range of light intensities).
nk you for raising this useful point. We have added the following sentence to make a
parison with everyday situation. This will hopefully make it easier for the reader to grasp
understand under which light conditions our experiment was carried out.
created two light treatments: “bright light”, using four lamps on highest intensity (2182 ± 65
; and “dull light” with two dimmed lamps (112 ± 12 lux, Figure 1). In comparison to a real life
ation, 112 lux would be comparable to the light during a very dark overcast day, i.e. as it is
ountered in a thick forest or during the early or late hours of the day. The bright light
ation, whilst considerably brighter, is comparable to an overcast day during noon. This
imum light intensity was limited by the luminance output of our lamps and the heat
duction. Our dullest light intensity was limited by the capabilities of our camera to record
rpretable images (see Supplementary Material Table S1). “
ddition, light measurements are useful, either in human-defined IS units (lux or Candela),
possibly even in spectral data, specifically when working indoors, where light spectra often
completely different to natural spectra. For instance, does the light have a UV component or
? Chickens have different flicker fusion frequency with and without UV, and it is not known
ther the same applies to pigeons.
nk you for raising this interesting point – we have now included this following text
bulbs used were tungsten halogen incandescent lamps that produce a continuous spectrum
ght, including near UV light (zeiss-campus.magnet.fsu.edu).
also do provide information on the light intensities as SI unit (lux) for the dull and bright light
l in the material and method part, see here: “We created two light treatments: “bright light”,
g four lamps on highest intensity (2182 ± 65 lux); and “dull light” with two dimmed lamps
2 ± 12 lux, Figure 1).”
he second part of this problem relates to the description of the background and predator
my intensities. These are not given anywhere. The most relevant information would be a
asurement (if these are reasonably close to the black-grey-white colour range this could be
e with a candelameter that measures the light reflected from a defined area into a defined
le (Cd/m2) of the predator dummy and the background, from the direction of the pigeon. The
trast between these two measurements is telling you whether indeed the dark morph had
er contrast against the black background and the bright morph, against the white
kground. From the very nice sketch of the set-up, I am not sure this really is the case. It all
ends on the illumination conditions, so it needs to be measured. It is important because it
ws you to answer the question whether the the behavior of the pigeons did not differ, simply
ause contrasts were not different, or whether the contrasts really differed but the pigeons did
care.
in, thank you for raising this interesting point.
ackle this issue, we have measured the contrast between the hawk and the background on
tos obtained directly from our video footage. The contrast ratio (relative luminance, L),
ed on the RGB colour space, shows that a light morph has less contrast in front of a white
kground and a dark morph in front of a black background. Contrary, light morphs show a
er contrast in front of a black background and dark morphs in front of a white background.
have now added the following text to the main paper
confirmed that the different hawk morphs were contrasting with the background colour by
ulating the contrast ratio (relative luminance). For full details see Table S2 & Figure S3-S4.”
we provide more information (see below) to the reader on the methods and results, in the
plementary. We hope this is to the satisfaction of the reviewer.
trast ratio between hawk morphs and backgrounds
used the online tool based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (see contrast-
o and WCAG10) to calculate the contrast ratio between the background and hawk colour in
RGB colour space, defined as the relative luminance (L). The highest ratio is obtained by
n black and plain white (L = 22) whereas a minimum score is reached by the same colours
1). A high ratio therefore implies high colour contrast (and good visibility) whereas a low
o indicates low colour contrast (better crypsis).
ur background experiment, we encounter two different light-background conditions: (1) low
t – white background and (2) low light – black background. In the light-change experiment,
encounter two different light-background conditions; we used (1) bright light – white
kground (2) low light – white background
t, we evaluated the consistency in space and time of the background colouration. It showed
gh consistency where the hawk first came into view, therefore we chose one pixel of the
kground colouration at the beginning of every trial video as the background colour.
ond, the contrast of the hawk against the background was measured at four fixed points:
, the breast (one pixel at the front, one in the back) and, second, the underwing coverts (left
right side). These four points are representing areas of high plumage colouration
rences between the morphs. Here we expect to see the differences of the contrast ratio
ween morphs to show a difference with light and dark morphs having a high contrast ratio
inst a black or white background, respectively, and low contrast values where the colour of
hawk matches the colour of the background.
le S2 shows the mean contrast ratio (relative luminance, L) and its standard deviation of the
black sparrowhawk morphs (dark or light) against the background colouration under varying
ditions during this experiment. For the light-change experiment, attacks were simulated
er under bright light – white background or low light – white background. In the background-
nge experiment, attacks were simulated either under low light – white background or low
t – black background.

result of the contrast ratio shows a high consistency between trials for the two colour
phs. These results validate our methodology to measure contrast in the RGB colour space.
ventral side shows varying contrast ratios, depending on the background colour and the
ph of the attacking hawk. The light morph shows a high contrast ratio when attacking in front
black background, similarly we obtained high contrast ratio for a dark morph attacking in
t of a white background. Low contrast ratio values were recorded for the dark morph
cking in front of a black background and for a light morph attacking in front of a white
kground (Table S2, Figure S3).
such effect was found for the light-change experiment – where the background colour stayed
same and only the light condition was altered. The contrast ratio measurements show that
contrast is very high for the dark morph under bright light levels but evens out and becomes
e similar to the contrast ratios of the light morph when the light level is decreased. No large
p of the contrast ratio is observed for the light morph, likely because the background colour
the colour of the hawk mount were similarly affected by a change of light conditions (Table
Figure S4).”
am a bit disappointed that the authors missed a very similar case of colour dimorphism, in
n owls, which have a white and a dark morph as well. A lot of work has been done on that
em, mostly by the group of Alexandre Roulin. A short discussion on this very similar case
ld bring a more general perspective to the problem and thus make this paper more
resting to general readers.
have now added text to the Introduction to introduce two study systems on colour-
morphic owls (including the barn owl system studied by A. Roulin) to the reader and added
paragraph to the introduction:
rn owl females (Tyto alba) show different habitat use, with reddish females occupying
tories with less wooded areas compared to white females. In the tawny owl (Strix aluco)
us birds occupied more wooded territories than grey birds, a pattern thought to be driven by
sis advantages for the different morphs [22].”
to the discussion:
spite finding for the black sparrowhawk that crypsis was neither morph- nor environmentally-
endent, we still recommend similar experiments to be carried out in other study systems of
ur-polymorphic raptors to identify the drivers of adaptive colour-polymorphism. For both
n and tawny owls, a difference in crypsis under varying environmental conditions is
pected [22, 52, 53], but has not been experimentally tested yet.”
er than these easily fixed points, I think the study is very solid.
nk you for your useful comments.
