I find interesting the way this manuscript approaches the individual processes of ecosystem C
cycling combined and I think the method used to do so is convincing. The manuscript provides
interesting results regarding the effects of plant functional types (PFTs) on the ecosystem
functioning. The manuscript can be recommended to be published after some minor revisions.
My concern related to the methods used are the quite shallow mesocosms (26 cm). Sedges that
have much deeper rooting depth dominate the vegetation at the site. I am wondering, how well
sedges could perform in such shallow peat layer after the long acclimatizations before the
drought experiment. From previous experience I know that the functioning of many sedge
species suffer rather easily when taken to the laboratory in mesocosms.
Although the removal experiment did not include any Sphagnum moss removals, I think it
would be fruitful to add some short discussion about the plant functional types of Sphagna and
their role in safeguarding the ecosystem carbon cycling. The studied site has rather homogeneous
Sphagnum species composition, but very often, that is not the case in peatlands.
In addition, I am suggesting to add some discussion, what kind of changes in vegetation could be
expected in poor fens due to climate change according to the current predictions. The response to
drought of such changed vegetation could then be discussed in the light of presented results. As a
general comment about the whole discussion I would ask the authors reduce the length of the
sentences to improve readability.
Specific comments:
R14 Should it be ”directly or indirectly”?
R15-16 Here, the term multifunctionality remains a little unclear. That makes it hard reading the
rest of the abstract, at least before reading the rest of the manuscript. It should be stated clearly
already here that overall function/multifunctionality is a combination of the four C-related
processes.
R19 Polytrichum
R28-29 I do not see a lot of ways to prevent changes in plant community composition in intact
peatlands in changing climate. Perhaps that is not what the authors meant. The last sentence
could be clarified.
R35 “Climate projections predict, for example, precipitation…”
R61 The sentence could be reformulated, e.g. “Climate change affects ecosystem processes
directly, but also indirectly, as the effects of…”
R107-109 How far away from each others were the mesocosm sampling locations and were they
visually chosen?
R117-122 Would be interesting to know, how much the overall vegetation cover was reduced as a
consequence of each of the treatments. It seems likely that the reduction was higher than the 5-10
% of cover removed from control mesocosms.
L208 NEE instead of NEP?
L218 “…resulted in a non-signifcant decrease…”
L246-250 Please split the sentence into two.
R262-264 But these changes were non-significant, excluding the treatment where all PFTs were
removed.
R273-274 Again, the change was non-significant, when individual PFTs were removed. This
could be again brought up in the discussion.
R291-294 Rather complicated sentence, please clarify.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors consider interactive effects of vegetation manipulation and drought on
multifunctionality of C functions in a temperate peat fen. While multifunctionality as a concept is
timely and currently very popular, there is probably a minimum number of functions where
multifunctionality is not necessary, and four is likely to be below this limit. Each of the four
functions could be presented individually and analysed separately. My further concern is
regarding the data handling of the CO2 fluxes; measuring CO2 flux in the light results in NEE
(net ecosystem CO2 exchange), and in the dark results in Reco (ecosystem respiration). By
subtracting Reco from NEE, you get photosynthesis (or Gross ecosystem exchange). Thus, NEE
can be used to inform net uptake of the system, or Reco and psyn can be used together to unpick
components of the flux. In this manuscript the authors have used NEE and GEP for their
multifunctionality calculation, which are too closely related, one being derived from the other.
My suggestion is to rerun the analyses substituting NEE for Reco.
Please check English and sentence construction throughout.
Lines 27-29: the results only seem to support the idea that plant cover maintains C
multifunctionality, not any change in composition. Either strengthen the reporting of the results
in the abstract or tone down the conclusion.
Line 36: where are we talking about? I’m not sure this is true everywhere.
Lines 44-47: is it worth bundling them all into one multifunctionality metric, if they are
contradictory? This could mean that mechanistic drivers of different processes are not
distinguishable. They are also controlled by different microbial groups etc. Strong rationale
needed for using multifunctionality. Also, if only four responses are measured, it’s probably just
as simple to look at them individually.
4
Line 63-64: there is a lot of information out there about effects of vegetation as modulators of
climate change effects; Moor House (Ostle, Ward, Bardgett, Walker) is a case in point. But
drought has far less empirical data. This sentence is misleading.
Line 124: clipping does not equate to removal of grasses. Therefore when the decaying roots point
comes up later, this is unconvincing because grasses are able to resprout from soil (in this case
moss) surface and will still contribute to respiration.
Lines 126-128: more rationale needed here.
Line 132: neglect the effect? I’m not sure what this means.
Line 158: do you mean gross ecosystem productivity? Or should the acronym be GEE? Because to
get that you would subtract Reco from NEE, surely? Reco is a component of NEE so I’m not sure
that adding the two together is correct. (check out Stoy et al 2006
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2006.09.001, as well as others such as Goulden et al. 1996
http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4xc445fg).
Line 161: I disagree with this statement, because the grasses are likely to be still alive.
Line 170: Including both GEP and NEE in this model is problematic because GEP is derived from
NEE, and thus likely to be collinear. Better to substitute NEE for RECO.
Line 212: grass roots likely to be still respiring.
Lines 259-262: this needs revisiting after the GEP-NEE-RECO problem has been sorted out.

Ecosystem Exchange. Please reconcile names.

Point 1: multifunctionalityWhile others have used multifunctionality indices for four or fewer
functions, this does not mean that it is more useful for understanding the mechanisms at work in
the study than looking at the functions individually. This is particularly true when the functions
are so closely related, GEP being derived from NEE. I appreciate that the authors have presented
some results with all four functions shown individually (I was not implying that it had not been
done, rather, that multifunctionality was not necessary), but the final graph showing the effect of
drought, has only been presented in terms of multifunctionality while individual variables have
been put in the appendix. Looking at this appendix graph, there are contrasting effects of time on
the different functions that have been averaged away in the multifunctionality graph, and the loss
of this information is one of the reasons that considering them individually is more useful and
informative than condensing them to an average.I feel some debate is necessary with regard to
9
whether multifunctionality has any benefits when few functions are considered. Clearly, part of
this debate should centre around the range of functions used; is it more valuable when a range
across C, N and P based functions are considered, than C alone.
Point 2: CO2 fluxes
I have been back over this extensively, and it seems that the confusion has arisen because it was
not clear from the original manuscript how long the fluxes were measured for, and whether they
were taken throughout the day and night. Looking back at the work of Bradford et al. in 2002
(Science) and 2014 (PNAS), they employed this method to sum the overall CO2 uptake of their
system from repeated samples over a 24 hour period, and they further applied mathematical
functions (Q10 corrections with temperature modelled as a sine curve) to account for the impact
of diurnal temperature fluxes. If this was done here then please detail it, because it is not
apparent in this manuscript. My original comments were based on the commonly used method of
taking light fluxes for a few minutes and then dark, whereupon adding the NEE and Reco values
together is certainly incorrect because of the enormous amount of uncertainty of diurnal
conditions. In this case it is usual to calculate photosynthetic rate by subtracting Reco from NEE,
and then considering Reco and psyn separately, or NEE as an overall flux. Nevertheless, I still
think that it is best to use photosynthetic rate and Reco, rather than GEP and NEE in
multifunctionality tests because these latter two are too closely related.
Minor points:
I cannot find the legend for the supplementary graph.
With regard to my comment about rationale on lines 126-128, I wanted to know why you chose to
remove 5-10% of cover (how selectively?) and how you arrived at the 5-10% value.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
I find interesting the way this manuscript approaches the individual processes of ecosystem C cycling
combined and I think the method used to do so is convincing.
The manuscript provides interesting results regarding the effects of plant functional types (PFTs) on the
ecosystem functioning. The manuscript can be recommended to be published after some minor revisions.
> We are happy this referee finds our manuscript of interests for publication. We appreciate her/his
thorough comments and suggestions, which below we comment on in an itemized manner.
My concern related to the methods used are the quite shallow mesocosms (26 cm). Sedges that have much
deeper rooting depth dominate the vegetation at the site. I am wondering, how well sedges could perform in
such shallow peat layer after the long acclimatizations before the drought experiment. From previous
experience I know that the functioning of many sedge species suffer rather easily when taken to the laboratory
in mesocosms.
> Indeed, for practical reasons the depth of the mesocosms was chosen to be as reported. As with all
mesocosms studies, the collection certainly has damaged part of the root systems of all vascular
plants. That is exactly why we acclimated the plant for a month before the start of the experiment;
giving the plant community time to recover. We did not notice any sign of decreased performance of
any of the plant species, also not the sedges.
Although the removal experiment did not include any Sphagnum moss removals, I think it would be fruitful to
add some short discussion about the plant functional types of Sphagna and their role in safeguarding the
ecosystem carbon cycling. The studied site has rather homogeneous Sphagnum species composition, but very
often, that is not the case in peatlands. In addition, I am suggesting to add some discussion, what kind of
changes in vegetation could be expected in poor fens due to climate change according to the current
predictions. The response to drought of such changed vegetation could then be discussed in the light of
presented results.
> We agree with the referee that all peatlands necessarily have such high cover in peat mosses. Yet,
the system which we have addressed in our research does. Moreover, it is a crucial part of the
system; without it, the system would collapse. That is why Sphagnum mosses were never removed,
as mentioned in the manuscript.
In the revised manuscript we address more of the literature on the effects of climate change
on alterations in peatland plant communities and discuss our results in the light of loss plant
functional types. (l.294-306)
As a general comment about the whole discussion I would ask the authors reduce the length of the sentences
to improve readability.
> We proof-read our discussion again, and split long sentences in two if possible.
Specific comments:
R14 Should it be ”directly or indirectly”?
> Changed
R15-16 Here, the term multifunctionality remains a little unclear. That makes it hard reading the rest of the
abstract, at least before reading the rest of the manuscript. It should be stated clearly already here that overall
function/multifunctionality is a combination of the four C-related processes.
> We changed this part of the abstract to: “Whilst the effects of drought and plant community
composition on individual carbon (C) related processes are well-understood, their effect on multiple
C-related process simultaneously –multifunctionality– are poorly known. We studied the effect of
drought on four C-related processes (net and gross CO2 exchange, methane fluxes, and dissolved
organic carbon content) in a plant removal experiment.” (l.14-19)
R19 Polytrichum
> Spelling mistake corrected
R28-29 I do not see a lot of ways to prevent changes in plant community composition in intact peatlands in
changing climate. Perhaps that is not what the authors meant. The last sentence could be clarified.
> Changed to: “Hence, to safeguard the carbon cycling function in intact peatlands, the effects of
climate change on the functional composition of the peatland plant community needs to be
minimized.” (l.27-29)
R35 “Climate projections predict, for example, precipitation…”
> Changed as suggested
R61 The sentence could be reformulated, e.g. “Climate change affects ecosystem processes directly, but also
indirectly, as the effects of…”
> Amended to: “Climate change affects ecosystem processes directly, but also indirectly through
alterations in the plant community composition, …”. (l.61-62)
R107-109 How far away from each others were the mesocosm sampling locations and were they visually
chosen?
> We specified this part of the text to fit the comment of the referee. “Extracted mesocosms were,
however, never extracted closer than 1m from each other, while taking care that each mesocosm
would contain a selection of species from all plant functional types (Sphagnum mosses, Polytrichum
spp., graminoids, and herbs).” (l.104-108)
R117-122 Would be interesting to know, how much the overall vegetation cover was reduced as a
consequence of each of the treatments. It seems likely that the reduction was higher than the 5-10 % of cover
removed from control mesocosms.
> We added a line in the revised text where we specify the biomass that has been removed from our
mesocosms per treatment: “As a result of these treatments, we removed 0.77 <U+F0B1> 0.1 g in the Control
mesocosms, 4.55 <U+F0B1> 1.4 g in the graminoids removal mesocosms, 0.24 <U+F0B1> 0.07 g in the herb removal
mesocosms, 13.5 <U+F0B1> 4.9 g in the Polytrichum removal mesocosms, 3.53 <U+F0B1> 0.4 g in the graminoids & herb
removal mesocosms, and 9.76 <U+F0B1> 2.6 g in the graminoid & herb & Polytrichum removal mesocosms.”.
In our statistical analyses the effect of biomass removal has been taken into account (see (e) Data
analyses).
L208 NEE instead of NEP?
> It should be NEE; changed in the revised manuscript.
L218 “…resulted in a non-signifcant decrease…”
> We follow this referees’ suggestion and changed our wording in the revised text.
L246-250 Please split the sentence into two.
> We followed the referees’ suggestion. The two sentences now read: “Additionally, the effects of
climate change driven alteration in plant community assembly on poor fen ecosystem processes is
well understood [19]. The combined effects of plant functional types on the overall performance of
these ecosystems, and on the ecosystems ability to sustain these functions, to our best of knowledge,
however, remain elusive.”
R262-264 But these changes were non-significant, excluding the treatment where all PFTs were removed.
> The referee is right that these results are non-significant. Yet, we still feel that this shift is ecologically
relevant and should accordingly be addressed. The statement we make here is preceded by an
elaborate discussion on the absence of clear effects of plant functional type removal on
multifunctionality, and should be interpreted in that context. Yet, to accommodate the concerns of
the referee, we changed our wording to: “Nevertheless, and despite the absence of pronounced
statistical differences in multifunctionality after PFT removal, the removal of PFTs from the
communities always resulted in a shift from positive to negative multifunctionality, …”.
R273-274 Again, the change was non-significant, when individual PFTs were removed. This could be again
brought up in the discussion.
> To be absolutely consistent we changed this sentence to: “Taken together, we conclude that
although the influence of plant community assembly on C-related multifunctionality seems to level
out due to contrasting effects on individual processes, the loss of individual plant functional types
slightly, though non-significantly, erodes the overall functioning of the poor fen system.”
The referee mentions the described phenomenon to be brought up in the discussion again.
We do not fully understand this suggestion, as the sentence referred to is the ‘wrap-up’ of a discussion
that details on this. Following an earlier suggestion of this referee, however, we added a short
paragraph on the effects of climate change driven alteration in the plant community, and discuss this
in the light of our findings.
R291-294 Rather complicated sentence, please clarify.
> We adjusted the particular sentence to: “Results from a recent study show that the protection of
current carbon stocks, is important in order to slow down the rate of increases in atmospheric CO2.”
Figures 1-4: The figure numbers are missing.
> We regret this inconvenience for the referee. In the uploading process, where we upload the main
text file and individual figure files, we are, however, not in control regarding the PDF construction. In
the revised version, we will make sure to add the Figure numbers to the uploaded figure caption, by
which this issue should be negated.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_8
The authors consider interactive effects of vegetation manipulation and drought on multifunctionality of C
functions in a temperate peat fen. While multifunctionality as a concept is timely and currently very popular,
there is probably a minimum number of functions where multifunctionality is not necessary, and four is likely
to be below this limit. Each of the four functions could be presented individually and analysed separately.
> We use multifunctionality as an easy to interpret measure of the ability of an ecosystem to sustain
multiple functions simultaneously. This index explicitly incorporates trade-offs in individual functions,
and gives a broader view on the overall performance of the system.
In her/his response, the referee mistakenly implies that we only examine the summary index
–multifunctionality– and ignore individual functions. The opposite is true; in our manuscript we
present data from the individual functions. In the discussion we use these data to understand how
single function responses play out on multifunctionality. We fully understand that in order to study
the forest, one needs to understand the individual trees. Along that line, the single function data are
presented in figure 2 and in supplementary figure 1, and have been analysed separately in our original
manuscript (see l.194-196 in the original version). In the revised manuscript we have now used a
separate subheading in the results section (a) Plant removal effect on individual ecosystems
functions to prevent further misunderstanding. (l.207)
We are not aware of a minimum number of functions below which multifunctionality is not
necessary. Being an averaging method, we would argue the minimum number of functions required
to calculate multifunctionality is two, even if not optimal. On that note, we have performed a cross
ecosystem ‘quick and dirty’ review on the literature (see table below), from which can be concluded
that the number of functions from which multifunctionality is calculated is highly variable.

Furthermore, recent work shows that the number of functions considered does not alter the
relationship between between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Gamfeldt and Roger 2017.
Nat. Ecol. Evol. 1:0168). Indeed, similar patterns were found for 3, 6 and 9 functions. Based on these
recent findings, we are confident with our approach.
My further concern is regarding the data handling of the CO2 fluxes; measuring CO2 flux in the light results in
NEE (net ecosystem CO2 exchange), and in the dark results in Reco (ecosystem respiration). By subtracting
Reco from NEE, you get photosynthesis (or Gross ecosystem exchange). Thus, NEE can be used to inform net
uptake of the system, or Reco and psyn can be used together to unpick components of the flux. In this
manuscript the authors have used NEE and GEP for their multifunctionality calculation, which are too closely
related, one being derived from the other. My suggestion is to rerun the analyses substituting NEE for Reco.
> The referee is absolutely right that GEP is calculated from the sum of NEE and R ECO (note: not
subtracting RECO from NEE as the referee suggests). This indeed implies that they are mathematically
related. They are however not necessarily biologically related as RECO comprises auto-and
heterotrophic respiration. The important point regarding the referee’s remark, however, is that due
to the mathematical relation between NEE, RECO and GEP, a replacement of NEE by RECO would not
change the message of the paper. In support of this, we have recalculated our z-values with RECO
replacing NEE against our original z-values. These rather nicely relate. We, however, have chosen to
report GEP and NEE in our manuscript as they have a similar sign. Presenting GEP and RECO, which have
opposite signs, would increase the change of these functions to cancel out each others effect in the
multifunctionality calculations.

Please check English and sentence construction throughout.
> Confirm the comments of this referee and referee 1, we have split some of the very long sentences
in the manuscript. We hope this has further improved readability.
Lines 27-29: the results only seem to support the idea that plant cover maintains C multifunctionality, not any
change in composition. Either strengthen the reporting of the results in the abstract or tone down the
conclusion.
> We actually do not intend to say that our data show changes in the plant community as a response
to climate change; our conclusion actually puts our results in the light of such changes. To prevent
further ambiguity, we changed the last sentence of the abstract (see also the response to referee 1).
Line 36: where are we talking about? I’m not sure this is true everywhere.
> We specified our geographical reference.
Lines 44-47: is it worth bundling them all into one multifunctionality metric, if they are contradictory? This
could mean that mechanistic drivers of different processes are not distinguishable. They are also controlled by
different microbial groups etc. Strong rationale needed for using multifunctionality. Also, if only four responses
are measured, it’s probably just as simple to look at them individually.
> The referee is absolutely right that many of these processes are driven by driven by different
variables, and can be contrasting. Exactly that is why we have assessed the individual variables
separately (see response to the first main comment by this referee, and figure 2 in the manuscript).
The beauty, however, in also looking a metric that combines these variables, without weighing their
importance, is that is gives a much more holistic view; in our case on the overall processes related to
C-cycling in these systems. As mentioned earlier, we fully acknowledge that the individual processes
should not be forgotten. Their importance is stressed in the manuscript, and by no means do we
attempt to ignore these.
Line 63-64: there is a lot of information out there about effects of vegetation as modulators of climate change
effects; Moor House (Ostle, Ward, Bardgett, Walker) is a case in point. But drought has far less empirical data.
This sentence is misleading.
> We adjusted this sentence to take way the ‘misleading’ direction: “These indirect effects are rather
understudied, yet important as changes in he plant community can modulate the negative impact of
climate change” (l.63-64)
Line 124: clipping does not equate to removal of grasses. Therefore when the decaying roots point comes up
later, this is unconvincing because grasses are able to resprout from soil (in this case moss) surface and will still
contribute to respiration.
> The referee is right that grasses resprout. That is exactly why throughout the experiment treatments
were reinforced by regular removal of regrowth. That said, the contribution of root respiration in
these mesocosms to RECO is likely to be very minimal (see Kuiper et al. 2014 Ecology 95, 123-131) .
Additionally, the random removal of individuals (see also the response to the comment below) in the
control mesocosms should slightly correct for making false conclusions.
Lines 126-128: more rationale needed here.
> We are not entirely sure what the referee exactly finds in need of more rationale. To prevent
differences between the control treatment and the removal treatment to not be caused by the
physical treatment, we have performed a clipping exercise in the control mesocosms as well. This had
left the composition on the vegetation unchanged, but allowed us to rule out the physical effects (but
also the respiration effects) of the removal treatments.
Line 132: neglect the effect? I’m not sure what this means.
> We changed this to ‘minimize’, and hope the referee now follows our reasoning.
Line 158: do you mean gross ecosystem productivity? Or should the acronym be GEE? Because to get that you
would subtract Reco from NEE, surely? Reco is a component of NEE so I’m not sure that adding the two
together is correct. (check out Stoy et al 2006 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2006.09.001, as well as
others such as Goulden et al. 1996 http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4xc445fg).
> See response to the second comment of this referee. This referee points towards two papers that
use micrometeorological convention to report gas fluxes. In our manuscript we clearly state (l158-
161) that we use the ecological sign convention, and even give the rationale for this choice.
Line 161: I disagree with this statement, because the grasses are likely to be still alive.
> We can see the point of the referee. To prevent ambiguity, we amended this sentence. “High
concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is the product of decomposition and plant
exudation, were seen as a negative function, as these DOCs can be lost from the ecosystem.” (l.162-
165)
Line 170: Including both GEP and NEE in this model is problematic because GEP is derived from NEE, and thus
likely to be collinear. Better to substitute NEE for RECO.
> See response to second comment by this referee.
Line 212: grass roots likely to be still respiring.
> This would be only an issue if we would have not also removed biomass in the control treatments.
Indeed, even after one month of acclimation, some root respiration may still be expected (although
Kuiper et al. 2014 Ecology 95: 123–131 have shown this effect to be marginal) but similar in all
treatments.
Lines 259-262: this needs revisiting after the GEP-NEE-RECO problem has been sorted out.
> See response to second comment by this referee.
Figure 2: Now GEP is called Gross Ecosystem Production, whereas above it is named Gross Ecosystem
Exchange. Please reconcile names.
> We cross-checked the whole manuscript and corrected GEE to GEP in all cases.

Subject
Revised manuscript submission RSOS-170449.R1
Dear editor, dear Alice Power,
We would like to submit a revised version of our paper (RSOS-170449.R1;
Diverse fen plant communities enhance carbon related functions, but do not
mitigate negative effects of drought), describing the results from an experiment
describing the effects of drought, and the role of plant community composition,
on carbon-related multifunctionality in peatlands. Our resubmission contains the
revised paper, and a 100-word layman summary of results.
We are again indebted to the input of an anonymous reviewer, whose critical
stance again improved the quality of our manuscript. As the referee is
anonymous we would hope you could pass our appreciations to this person.
Please find below our response to the reviewers newest comments on our
manuscript. We have contacted the editorial office earlier, addressing our
concern regarding the referees comment on our calculation and statistical
approach (point 2). In our previous comments we have addressed this issue in
detail. The referee clearly disagrees, and again proposes a recalculation of our
multifunctionality index. As said earlier, the proposed change will not make any
difference. As we felt we were getting in a game of ‘yes it is, no it is not’, we have
addressed this issue with the Editorial Coordinator Alice Power. We were happy
to be informed that the editorial team agrees that we ‘have adequately
considered the reviewer's concerns about statistics, and therefore the subject
editor will be willing to proceed with our manuscript if we simply explain our
multifunctionality method in your manuscript’.
Point 1: multifunctionality
> Indeed, multifunctionality is an average measure of several processes. We,
however, think that our focus on C-related processes is actually quite strong.
Carbon cycling in peatlands is driven by a suit of (related) processes. Whilst the
individual processes are important –and discussed in detail– in our paper, it is
the simultaneous effects of these processes – multifunctionality – that gives most
information on the net effect of all these processes on the function. We have now
added a paragraph (l.280-294) in the discussion that addresses the way we have
used multifunctionality. We hope the referee can be convinced by such addition.
Point 2: CO2 fluxes
> In our previous comments we have explained in detail why we have chosen
the C-related functions for calculating multifunctionality (see our general remark
to the editor).
Minor points:
I cannot find the legend for the supplementary graph.
> All symbols in the supplementary figure 1 were accompanied by the
treatment abbreviations. In the newest version of the manuscript we will makes
sure these abbreviations are explained in the legend.
With regard to my comment about rationale on lines 126-128, I wanted to know
why you chose to remove 5-10% of cover (how selectively?) and how you
arrived at the 5-10% value.
> We removed 5-10 % of the vegetation as to have a real control; one that
corrected for the effects of plant removal. We arrived to this number by visual
evaluation of the effect of clipping on the cover in the other treatments.
Underpinned by the biomass removal values, we have succeeded to remove
biomass which is not far of form the herb removal treatment. We were careful to
be balanced in which PFTs were removed. We added a line in the methodology
section (l129-131)
