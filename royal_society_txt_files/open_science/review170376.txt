Summary.
The study investigates how many nucleotides can be removed from the 3’-terminus of the R18
polymerase ribozyme before catalytic activity drops. Surprisingly, the authors find that many
nucleotides of the catalytic core can be removed before ligation activity disappears. I assume that
this is a false positive, based on a technical problem with the activity assay. This manuscript
would have to undergo strong changes, including a re-doing of most experiments (they appear to
be done only as single experiments, and no error bars are shown), to be considered worthy of
publication.
If the authors want to pursue publication I suggest re-doing the experiments with the 76-
nucleotide construct, in at least three independent replicates, each with a positive and negative
control. If the authors are able to confirm activity of this construct then this would be worthy to
pursue the manuscript further, under a different title such as “catalytic activity of the class I
ligase ribozyme without its previously identified catalytic groups”.
My page numbers refer to the author’s numbers added in the Word file - not the numbers added
by the journal later in the pdf file.
Major comments:
Essential to be solved: The studied molecule is a polymerase ribozyme, which has a catalytic core
catalyzing RNA ligation. The assayed reaction is RNA ligation. It would be expected that the
accessory domain of the polymerase ribozyme can be deleted without complete loss of ligation
activity, while any truncation to the ligase ribozyme would be expected to have a deleterious
impact on ligation activity. This thought would be important to describe in the introduction.
Figures 2 and 3 imply that the construct with a length of 76 nucleotides has ligation activity.
This finding is in conflict with the known functional importance of nucleotides in this ribozyme
(Shechner et al 2011, NSMB 18 (9) 1036-42). This finding, if the authors want to maintain it,
would require very solid experimental results (such as triplicate experiments with error bars),
showing of the primary data (threshold cycles of RT-qPCR?), and would justify a new title or the
manuscript (such as “catalytic activity of the class I ligase ribozyme without its previously
identified catalytic groups”).
Page 8, line 163: The authors appear to imply that only substrate binding but not catalysis is
necessary for ligation. This may be a fundamental misunderstanding by the authors of ligase
ribozyme function, which could explain almost all of my concerns with this manuscript.
Page 9, line 188 and later: The conclusions need to be thoroughly re-worked to accommodate
the concerns described above.
I assume that the positive result for ligation activity of R18-T2 (and possibly other constructs)
is due to a technical problem with the assay. For example, reverse transcriptase may jump from
one molecule to the next, or aerosols are varied over during pipetting between constructs. RT-
PCR experiments are difficult to do in a quantitative fashion, and the setup of the authors appears
not up to this task.
If I am mistaken about the constructs lacking portions of the catalytic core having activity then
I withdraw the comments above. In this case, the focus of a revised manuscript would need to be
on the clarity of
Figure 1 / 2: The labeling of the constructs with different sizes needs to be consistent. The
manuscript uses three different types of labeling; these need to be collapsed into one. I suggest
using only the sizes in nucleotides and not A-F (Fig. 1) or R18-T1… (Fig. 1, legend). This needs to
be done throughout the manuscript.
3
Page 23 (figure 3?) appears to display the same type of data as shown on page 22 (figure 2?), only
in a non-quantitative format. I strongly suggest displaying the data with different templates in
the same format as in figure 2, which has the quantitative aspect. If the authors want to introduce
a qualitative aspect - such as labeling all constructs above a certain activity limit as active (and
others as inactive) then this can be done by introducing a ‘background’ line into figure 2.
Any data point from which important conclusions are drawn needs to be obtained from at least
three independent experiments.
Minor comments:
Page 2, line 38/39: At this point it would be important to describe to what extent the three
different, discussed activities could have been involved in the replicate of an RNA world
organism. My own understanding is that ultimately an RNA polymerization function is
necessary, but that the investigation of RNA ligase function is important because it catalyzes the
same chemistry as RNA polymerization. I personally feel that RNA recombinases are not as
important for replication but one could make arguments along the lines of Vaidya et al (2013),
Nature 491, 72-77.
Along these lines, the argument on page 2 line 43 to page 3 line 50 is based on the assumption
that ligase ribozymes would have been sufficient for self replicating in an RNA world. I am
skeptical of that notion, using the logic described in James & Ellington 1999, OLEG 29, 375-90.
Again, I suggest motivating the use of ligase ribozymes on their use of the same chemistry as
polymerase ribozymes.
The lines 48 to 51 stress the importance of a polymerase ribozyme. It would have been easier
and better supported if the argument would have included the more general considerations that
have already been published.
Page 2, line 42: This central comment on the size of ligation ribozymes is incorrect: Most in vitro
selected ligase ribozymes are smaller than 100 nt, with the only exception being the class I
ribozyme from the Bartel lab. The DSL ribozyme is less than 100 nt in length (Ikawa et al 2004,
PNAS 101, 137450-5, Fig. 1C), as is the L1 ligase ribozyme (Robertson and Scott 2007, Science 315,
1549-1553, Fig. 1C), the R3C ligase ribozyme (Rogers and Joyce 2001, RNA 7, 395-404, Fig. 1).

The paper by Dhar et al. reports on the study of self-ligation activity of a number of truncated
variants of a previously developed RNA polymerase ribozyme. This RNA polymerase ribozyme
is derived from an RNA ligase ribozyme, and thus has intrinsic ligation activity. The aim of the
study is to demonstrate the emergence of large and thus more complex RNAs from shorter ones
by self-ligation in an RNA world at the origin of life.
A number of substrates were used to test self-ligation activity of the variants. As a result, shorter
variants of the original ribozyme, i.e. small RNAs, showed higher promiscuity regarding the
substrates but were not so efficient in ligation. On the opposite, less truncated variants showed
high ligation activity, but turned out being more specific for certain substrates. This result was
interpreted in the way that small spontaneously formed RNAs in the RNA world with weak self-
ligation activity could have supported formation of larger RNAs, although first with little
5
specificity. When more complex RNAs had formed, specificity and ligation activity have
increased. This interpretation indeed is supported by the presented data.
The authors attempt an explanation for the observed reactivity/specificity characteristics, which
however remains rather speculative and theoretical. I miss experiments for verification. For
example, it is not clear how substrates interact with the ribozyme variants for ligation. The
authors provide some secondary structure calculations for the individual substrates, but do not
study interaction with the ribozyme. Structure probing data in the absence and presence of
substrates/ribozymes like SHAPE, in line probing or other would allow drawing conclusions on
interaction sites and/or conformational changes upon substrate binding. Furthermore, the
previous study on ligation of a wide variety of substrates by truncated and fragmented hairpin
ribozyme derivatives (here Ref. 16: Vlassov et al., 2004, NAR, 32, 2966), limits originality of the
present study. This work should be discussed in more detail.
Specific points:
-What is the rationale behind substrate design (e.g. chosen sequences, DNA-RNA chimera, why
exactly four terminal ribonucleotides?
-As control for detection of self-ligation activity, PCR of the ribozyme (without ligation) with
primers F2 and R was carried out. What about PCR of the ribozyme with primers F1 and R? This
would be a necessary negative control.
- Many of important data and information are buried in the Supplement (e.g. Fig. S2 and a Figure
combining data shown in Fig. S3.1 to S3.5; Fig.S4.8 and S4.9, Figures might be combined in one
Figure with two or more panels; Table S3), but should be shown as Figures/Tables included in
the main text.
- What are the models/equations used for curve fitting in Figures 2 and Figure S4.9?

I thank the authors for thoroughly addressing my concerns. I am especially glad that my central
concern, the lacking of catalytic nucleotides, could be addressed well. I support the publication of
this manuscript after my relatively small comments below have been addressed.
Now that it has been made clear in the manuscript that the catalytic nucleobase and two other
nucleotides at the catalytic site are contained in all constructs the issue becomes a different one,
which is currently not described (as far as I can see). Specifically, the question becomes how these
nucleotides can be positioned in the right geometry for catalysis if the structural framework
around them is missing. This needs to be discussed for the different constructs. For illustration of
that question I suggest a supplementary figure that should be easy to make: If the crystal
structure by Shechner et al is shown with only those nucleotides present in each construct it
should become clear which of the constructs is expected to lack the structural framework to
support the geometry for catalysis. Alternatively, this could be shown as an addition to figure 1.
I am not satisfied with the response to table 1, in which qualitative data of a quantitative reaction
are reported. Instead of the +/- signs I would like the authors to show estimate the amount of
material based on the RT-qPCR threshold cycles. In cases where more than 35 cycles were
necessary (i.e. a negative result) I would like the authors to state an upper limit (e.g. “< 2 fmol”).
The conversion of threshold cycles to molar amounts should then be described in the materials
and methods section. If the authors don’t feel comfortable with converting threshold cycles to
molar amounts then the threshold cycles should be given directly in table 1, with “>35” for the
current negative results.
I saw in the revision that several nucleotides of the substrate are in the form of deoxynucleotides.
This could be a problem because several 2’-hydroxyl groups of the substrate are necessary for
binding bye the polymerase (Muller UF and Bartel DP 2003, Chemistry & Biology 10, 799). It
would help if this is shortly mentioned and discussed.

Johnston et al 2001. The legend of figure 1 should number the catalytic nucleotides A29, C30, C47.

The authors have revised the manuscript taking into account some but by far not all concerns
raised by the two Referees. The paper has improved regarding the clarity of the results and
presentation. However, no further experiments (as required) were carried out to solidify the
results and claims. There is a lot of assumptions and speculation, how the investigated ribozymes
interact with their substrates. The authors repeatedly discuss structure and conformation effects.
However, there are no experiments to look at these influences. In my previous Review I have
already recommended structure analysis by SHAPE, in line or chemical probing to study the
conformation and conformational changes of the ribozymes in the presence and absence of
substrates. This would help to understand how in particular the very short ribozyme interacts
with the substrate and still can support ligation. This kind of deeper analysis is important to
strengthen the paper, because the pure message that RNA supported ligation of short fragments
is possible, is nothing new.In summary, I consider the revised version of the paper as still
premature for publication and strongly recommend further experiments towards deeper
understanding of the ribozyme-substrate interaction for ligation.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I thank the authors for thoroughly addressing my concerns. I am especially glad that my central
concern, the lacking of catalytic nucleotides, could be addressed well. I support the publication of
this manuscript after my relatively small comments below have been addressed.
Now that it has been made clear in the manuscript that the catalytic nucleobase and two other
nucleotides at the catalytic site are contained in all constructs the issue becomes a different one,
which is currently not described (as far as I can see). Specifically, the question becomes how these
nucleotides can be positioned in the right geometry for catalysis if the structural framework
around them is missing. This needs to be discussed for the different constructs. For illustration of
that question I suggest a supplementary figure that should be easy to make: If the crystal
structure by Shechner et al is shown with only those nucleotides present in each construct it
should become clear which of the constructs is expected to lack the structural framework to
support the geometry for catalysis. Alternatively, this could be shown as an addition to figure 1.
I am not satisfied with the response to table 1, in which qualitative data of a quantitative reaction
are reported. Instead of the +/- signs I would like the authors to show estimate the amount of
material based on the RT-qPCR threshold cycles. In cases where more than 35 cycles were
necessary (i.e. a negative result) I would like the authors to state an upper limit (e.g. “< 2 fmol”).
15
The conversion of threshold cycles to molar amounts should then be described in the materials
and methods section. If the authors don’t feel comfortable with converting threshold cycles to
molar amounts then the threshold cycles should be given directly in table 1, with “>35” for the
current negative results.
I saw in the revision that several nucleotides of the substrate are in the form of deoxynucleotides.
This could be a problem because several 2’-hydroxyl groups of the substrate are necessary for
binding bye the polymerase (Muller UF and Bartel DP 2003, Chemistry & Biology 10, 799). It
would help if this is shortly mentioned and discussed.

Johnston et al 2001. The legend of figure 1 should number the catalytic nucleotides A29, C30, C47.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have revised the manuscript taking into account some but by far not all concerns
raised by the two Referees. The paper has improved regarding the clarity of the results and
presentation. However, no further experiments (as required) were carried out to solidify the
results and claims. There is a lot of assumptions and speculation, how the investigated ribozymes
interact with their substrates. The authors repeatedly discuss structure and conformation effects.
However, there are no experiments to look at these influences. In my previous Review I have
already recommended structure analysis by SHAPE, in line or chemical probing to study the
conformation and conformational changes of the ribozymes in the presence and absence of
substrates. This would help to understand how in particular the very short ribozyme interacts
with the substrate and still can support ligation. This kind of deeper analysis is important to
strengthen the paper, because the pure message that RNA supported ligation of short fragments
is possible, is nothing new.
In summary, I consider the revised version of the paper as still premature for publication and
strongly recommend further experiments towards deeper understanding of the ribozyme-
substrate interaction for ligation.

neral comments
nk you for your comments and suggestions. These have assisted us with improving the
nuscript. We have detailed our responses to the comments and described the changes to the
nuscript below. Many sections, including the Abstract, have been rewritten and there are too
ny major and minor changes in the revised manuscript for all of these to be highlighted in the
n text itself. The rewritten sections that address specific comments by the reviewers are
icted.
primary issues appear to be as follows. Reviewer 1 suggests that the finding of a positive
tion reaction in the shortest RNA molecules is a false positive. The reviewer says this is due
he removal of the catalytically important residues. In the responses below and the revised
nuscript we explain in greater detail that the 3 most essential catalytically active residues are
act present. Furthermore, extensive controls were performed and the technical aspects of the
eriments considered in great detail. Based on the data we hope to convince the reviewer that
se are not false positives.
iewer 2 suggested structure probing experiments using SHAPE to support the experimental
a. This methodology is based on acylation of the 2' hydroxyl group of the ribose in single
nded regions. The limitation of our study is that the ribozyme reactions were studied with the
strate sequences that were majorly composed of deoxyribonucleotides (to restrict the
mation of tertiary structures within the substrate sequence) with only 4 ribonucleotide residues
he 3' end. The value of the SHAPE structure probing approach therefore seems limited and
not pursued.
iewer 2 suggested that some of the important results be moved from the supplementary
rmation to the main text. This has been done and was helpful to provide more clarity
cerning the experimental design and results. A new figure (Figure 2) has also been included
how some of the experimental data.
iewer 2 also wished a clearer interpretation of Figure 2 (now Figure 3) and Figure S4.9. We
e included the equations that describe the graphs and have modified our conclusions.

study investigates how many nucleotides can be removed from the 3’-terminus of the R18
ymerase ribozyme before catalytic activity drops. Surprisingly, the authors find that many
leotides of the catalytic core can be removed before ligation activity disappears. I assume that
is a false positive, based on a technical problem with the activity assay. This manuscript
uld have to undergo strong changes, including a re-doing of most experiments (they appear to
done only as single experiments, and no error bars are shown), to be considered worthy of
lication.
he authors want to pursue publication I suggest re-doing the experiments with the 76-
leotide construct, in at least three independent replicates, each with a positive and negative
trol. If the authors are able to confirm activity of this construct then this would be worthy to
sue the manuscript further, under a different title such as “catalytic activity of the class I
se ribozyme without its previously identified catalytic groups”.

jor comments:
ential to be solved: The studied molecule is a polymerase ribozyme, which has a catalytic
e catalyzing RNA ligation. The assayed reaction is RNA ligation. It would be expected that
accessory domain of the polymerase ribozyme can be deleted without complete loss of
tion activity, while any truncation to the ligase ribozyme would be expected to have a
eterious impact on ligation activity. This thought would be important to describe in the
oduction.
ures 2 and 3 imply that the construct with a length of 76 nucleotides has ligation activity. This
ing is in conflict with the known functional importance of nucleotides in this ribozyme
echner et al 2011, NSMB 18 (9) 1036-42). This finding, if the authors want to maintain it,
uld require very solid experimental results (such as triplicate experiments with error bars),
wing of the primary data (threshold cycles of RT-qPCR?), and would justify a new title or the
nuscript (such as “catalytic activity of the class I ligase ribozyme without its previously
ntified catalytic groups”).
ponse
agree with the functional importance of the nucleotides identified in the ligase ribozyme for
alysis by Shechner et al 2009, Science, 326; 1271-1275 and Shechner eta al 2011, NSMB, 18:
6-1042. Our findings are not in conflict with their finding because Shechner et al 2009
cifically identified three most essential residues present at the 5' end of the molecule that were
ical for ligation activity. All three of these residues are present in all the truncated molecules
our study including the smallest ribozyme (marked yellow in Figure 1). The activity of the
allest ribozyme R18-T4 indicates that the 5’region forms a minimal active site. Our results
hlight that the 5’region with the 3 critical residues accounts for the ligases being catalytically
ve or not i.e. if they can ligate a substrate or not. The larger ligases R18-T3 and R18-T2
ch were composed of the additional 3’region functionally important nucleotides
onstrated improved efficiency. This indicated that the 3’segments of the molecules with the
aining catalytic residues (identified by Shechner et al 2009) endowed the molecules with
reased efficiency and removal of this region decreased the efficiency substantially. Our
ings support the Shechner et al findings and at the same time provide new insights. We think
ligation activity of the truncated molecules stands justified.
ddition, we would like to point out that unlike all previous studies (including Shechner et al
9, 2011); the present study was designed to use substrates that were not intentionally base
red with the ribozyme. There may, of course, be unintentional base pairing that could have
uenced the overall ribozyme-substrate structural complex and interaction of the catalytic
dues, which may have also resulted in the observed catalytic activity in the truncated
zymes. This is now mentioned in the text.
true that the quantification aspect in this study is indeed different as compared to previous
dies. The catalytic assessment of the ribozyme in previous studies was performed by
iolabeling of the ribozyme or substrate molecule and quantification of the ligated product by
sitometric analysis using phosphorimaging. In our study, the product could not be assessed
ng this technique possibly due to the absence of experimentally defined substrate binding sites
he ribozymes (the ligation product of the complete ligase core of the polymerase, R18-T2,
under the detectable limits of phosphorimaging). The absence of a defined site could have
reased the threshold energy for the occurrence of the ligation reaction, which may have
cted the product yield. Additionally, the absence of some of the residues at the 3’end
inished the ribozyme's activity. The assessment of the product was therefore done using RT-
CR which offers a more sensitive (up to femtogram quantities) method of detection. The
ted products were confirmed using sequencing. The differences in the methodology of the
sent study as compared to the previous studies has provided insights into some important
ects of the previously identified essential catalytic groups (Shechner et al 2009, 2011) and the
ults remain in agreement with their findings.
experiments assessed the activity of each ribozyme individually with each substrate (Figures
8 and S4.9) and demonstrate the efficiency range of each ribozyme with different substrates.
se assays by themselves are replicates for each ribozyme even if the experimental design
de use of different substrates. The results demonstrated that the activity remained in a narrow
ge even when there is minor variation in the substrate sequences. This in fact strongly
ports the observed activity of each ribozyme and is a better assessment of ribozyme activity
repeated experiments using the same substrate. Furthermore, at the origin of life, any kind of
strate could have been present and we do not know in what concentrations, which suggests it
ore meaningful to perform the experimental replicates of ribozyme efficiency with different
strates rather than limiting analysis with the same substrate at a predefined concentration.
ase see the rewritten sections ‘Model system’ and ‘Self-ligation activity’ in the Results and
cussion as well as sections ‘R18 ribozyme and its truncations’ and ‘Detection of self-ligation
vity of R18 and its truncated molecules’ in the Materials and Methods.
e 8, line 163: The authors appear to imply that only substrate binding but not catalysis is
essary for ligation. This may be a fundamental misunderstanding by the authors of ligase
zyme function, which could explain almost all of my concerns with this manuscript.
ponse
s has been addressed in the revised manuscript. We state that the catalytic residues as well as
anced substrate binding were essential for the observed increased efficiency in the larger
lecules. In the smaller molecules, the efficiency was compromised due to the absence of some
he catalytic residues at the 3’ end as well as weak substrate binding. See the ‘Model System’
‘Self-ligation activity’ sections - first two paragraphs of Results and Discussion.
e 9, line 188 and later: The conclusions need to be thoroughly re-worked to accommodate the
cerns described above.
sume that the positive result for ligation activity of R18-T2 (and possibly other constructs) is
to a technical problem with the assay. For example, reverse transcriptase may jump from one
lecule to the next, or aerosols are varied over during pipetting between constructs. RT-PCR
eriments are difficult to do in a quantitative fashion, and the setup of the authors appears not
to this task.
ponse
h ribozyme-substrate reaction was not only set up in different tubes, but the time course
lysis of only a single ribozyme was done at any one time. The jumping of reverse
scriptase or aerosols across constructs does not seem to be possible.
am mistaken about the constructs lacking portions of the catalytic core having activity then I
hdraw the comments above. In this case, the focus of a revised manuscript would need to be
the clarity of
ure 1 / 2: The labeling of the constructs with different sizes needs to be consistent. The
nuscript uses three different types of labeling; these need to be collapsed into one. I suggest
ng only the sizes in nucleotides and not A-F (Fig. 1) or R18-T1… (Fig. 1, legend). This needs
e done throughout the manuscript.
ponse
made an honest attempt to effect the change suggested by the reviewer. However, labeling
constructs in the form of sizes in nucleotides introduced an awful lot of numbers and
etition of the word “nucleotides”. The manuscript consistently uses the labels R18-T1, R18-
R18-T3 and R18-T4 for the different truncated constructs of R18 and we hope this is easier
ollow rather than labelling constructs in sizes of nucleotides.
e 23 (figure 3?) appears to display the same type of data as shown on page 22 (figure 2?),
y in a non-quantitative format. I strongly suggest displaying the data with different templates
he same format as in figure 2, which has the quantitative aspect. If the authors want to
oduce a qualitative aspect - such as labeling all constructs above a certain activity limit as
ve (and others as inactive) then this can be done by introducing a ‘background’ line into
re 2.
ponse
assume the reviewer is referring to Table 1 as Figure 3 in the comment - there was no Figure
ubmitted in the first submission. Table 1 represents the overall results (including the failed
tion reactions; denoted as -). The failed reactions could not be quantified when taken further
quantitative real-time analysis as the reaction PCR products were below the CP threshold
it of the assay (CP value of greater than 35 was the threshold for absence of DNA as
ntified from the standard curves shown in supplementary section SF). The reaction
centrations could therefore not be plotted on a graph.
representation of negative reactions in a qualitative fashion compares the impact of different
ds of substrates on the occurrence of ligations. For the evolution of RNA based life, efficient
ses or other catalysts were required but the findings in Table 1 show that the activity of
ses was not completely unconstrained by the kind of substrate sequences present in the
ironment and could fail even in the presence of an efficient catalyst. Moreover, table 1
litatively represents the three different patterns that were observed (discussed in detail in
ults section “Functional flexibility of ribozymes”) which provide insights into relationship
ween increasing ribozyme size and their ligation flexibility.

nor comments:
e 2, line 38/39: At this point it would be important to describe to what extent the three
erent, discussed activities could have been involved in the replicate of an RNA world
anism. My own understanding is that ultimately an RNA polymerization function is
essary, but that the investigation of RNA ligase function is important because it catalyzes the
e chemistry as RNA polymerization. I personally feel that RNA recombinases are not as
ortant for replication but one could make arguments along the lines of Vaidya et al (2013),
ure 491, 72-77.
ng these lines, the argument on page 2 line 43 to page 3 line 50 is based on the assumption
ligase ribozymes would have been sufficient for self replicating in an RNA world. I am
ptical of that notion, using the logic described in James & Ellington 1999, OLEG 29, 375-90.
ain, I suggest motivating the use of ligase ribozymes on their use of the same chemistry as
ymerase ribozymes.

logic.
ponse
think that the reviewer is making the assumption that the evolution of many substrates
cific to the ribozymes could have easily occurred. However, this may not have been the
nario 4 billion years ago. This study was therefore intentionally designed to examine the
act of a lack of specific base pairing of the substrates with the ligases. We found that the lack
pecific substrate binding site could also crucially impact ligation activity as the efficiency of
full length ligase core R18-T2 of the polymerase also decreased. The reactions still occurred
ough with lower efficiency.
the previous studies have carried out the ligation assay with specific 6-10 nucleotides
plementary substrates which introduces an experimental bias. This study is the first attempt
explore the ligations in an environmental condition where substrates of any kind and not
essarily complementary to the ribozyme could be present. We think this scenario has been
ored by the researchers in the field and therefore, it is worthwhile to mention this rationale.

paper by Dhar et al. reports on the study of self-ligation activity of a number of truncated
iants of a previously developed RNA polymerase ribozyme. This RNA polymerase ribozyme
erived from an RNA ligase ribozyme, and thus has intrinsic ligation activity. The aim of the
dy is to demonstrate the emergence of large and thus more complex RNAs from shorter ones
self-ligation in an RNA world at the origin of life. A number of substrates were used to test
-ligation activity of the variants. As a result, shorter variants of the original ribozyme, i.e.
all RNAs, showed higher promiscuity regarding the substrates but were not so efficient in
tion. On the opposite, less truncated variants showed high ligation activity, but turned out
ng more specific for certain substrates. This result was interpreted in the way that small
ntaneously formed RNAs in the RNA world with weak self-ligation activity could have
ported formation of larger RNAs, although first with little specificity. When more complex
As had formed, specificity and ligation activity have increased. This interpretation indeed is
ported by the presented data. The authors attempt an explanation for the observed
ctivity/specificity characteristics, which however remains rather speculative and theoretical. I
s experiments for verification. For example, it is not clear how substrates interact with the
zyme variants for ligation. The authors provide some secondary structure calculations for the
ividual substrates, but do not study interaction with the ribozyme. Structure probing data in
absence and presence of substrates/ribozymes like SHAPE, in line probing or other would

6), limits originality of the present study. This work should be discussed in more detail.

structure probing experiments using SHAPE to the best of our knowledge are used for
bing the ribozyme-substrate complex structure only in the case of ribonucleotides sequence.
APE reagents are based on acylation of the 2' hydroxyl group of the ribose in single stranded
ions. The limitation of the present study is that the ribozyme reactions were studied with
strate sequences composed of deoxyribonucleotides with only 4 ribonucleotide residues at the
nd. In this case, the SHAPE probing analysis might misrepresent the ribozyme-substrate
plex/ interaction. One of the objectives behind using DNA-RNA chimera substrates was to
dy the ability of the ribozymes to ligate different substrates that formed varying degree of
ondary structures. The rationale of using deoxyribonucleotides was to restrict the formation of
iary structures within the substrate sequence. The use of substrate sequences composed
rely of only ribonucleotides would have allowed tertiary structures and that was not suitable
the specific objectives of the study.

General comments
Thank you for your comments during this review process. These have helped strengthen our
manuscript. Our responses to the minor comments are listed below. We have also made some
very minor typographical changes (eg changes to the acknowledgements), which are not worth
listing here.

Comments to the Author(s)
I thank the authors for thoroughly addressing my concerns. I am especially glad that my central
concern, the lacking of catalytic nucleotides, could be addressed well. I support the publication
of this manuscript after my relatively small comments below have been addressed.
Now that it has been made clear in the manuscript that the catalytic nucleobase and two other
nucleotides at the catalytic site are contained in all constructs the issue becomes a different one,
which is currently not described (as far as I can see). Specifically, the question becomes how
these nucleotides can be positioned in the right geometry for catalysis if the structural
framework around them is missing. This needs to be discussed for the different constructs. For
illustration of that question I suggest a supplementary figure that should be easy to make: If the
crystal structure by Shechner et al is shown with only those nucleotides present in each
construct it should become clear which of the constructs is expected to lack the structural
framework to support the geometry for catalysis. Alternatively, this could be shown as an
addition to figure 1.
Response
We appreciate that the structural aspects are a limitation of this study. The suggestion that a
comparison of our ribozymes with the catalysis geometry based on Shechner et al does not
seem right to apply. This is because Shechner et al crystallized a variant of the Class I ligase-
produced by in vitro selection experiments. In our study, R18 polymerase developed by
Johnston et al was used as the model. Although, the ligase core of R18 polymerase is also a
minor variant of the original Class I ligase, the nucleotide composition of the crystallised ligase
variant is not identical to the R18 ligase variant. The two structures cannot be compared
directly.
Shechner et al crystallised the full length Class I ligase variant for determination of the catalysis
geometry. In our study, we used the truncated molecules of the Class I ligase variant. Secondary
and tertiary RNA molecular structures obviously depend on the sequence information and
length. In truncated RNA molecules, the secondary structures and tertiary contacts will be
different to the ones formed in the full length sequence. The nucleotide geometry for catalysis
by the ribozymes in our study, thus, cannot be illustrated based on the structural framework
provided by Shechner et al. What is evident, however, is that the truncated ribozymes used in
this study do form motifs with a geometry that is sufficient for activity.
We have acknowledged at the end of section on self-ligation rate on Page 9 that the detailed
analysis of catalysis geometry and the ribozyme-substrate interactions are the limitations of our
study.
I am not satisfied with the response to table 1, in which qualitative data of a quantitative
reaction are reported. Instead of the +/- signs I would like the authors to show estimate the
amount of material based on the RT-qPCR threshold cycles. In cases where more than 35 cycles
were necessary (i.e. a negative result) I would like the authors to state an upper limit (e.g. “< 2
fmol”). The conversion of threshold cycles to molar amounts should then be described in the
materials and methods section. If the authors don’t feel comfortable with converting threshold
cycles to molar amounts then the threshold cycles should be given directly in table 1, with
“>35” for the current negative results.
Response
This has been corrected in the material and methods in the section “Determination of the rate
of ribozyme self-ligation activity” (page 15 and 16) and legend of Table 1.
I saw in the revision that several nucleotides of the substrate are in the form of
deoxynucleotides. This could be a problem because several 2’-hydroxyl groups of the substrate
are necessary for binding bye the polymerase (Muller UF and Bartel DP 2003, Chemistry &
Biology 10, 799). It would help if this is shortly mentioned and discussed.
Response
This is now included in the end of section on self-ligation rate on page 9.
line 440 and figure 1: This secondary structure is not taken from Shechner et al 2009 but from
Johnston et al 2001. The legend of figure 1 should number the catalytic nucleotides A29, C30,
C47.
Response
We could not find this error as specified by the reviewer. This has been checked thoroughly
and the references are correctly cited.
In Figure 1,
(A) Class I ligase structure showing the catalytically important residues is correctly
referenced as Shechner et al 2009
(B) R18 polymerase, the model of our study is correctly referenced as Johnston et al 2001.
The numbers of the catalytic nucleotides are mentioned in detail in the text.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have revised the manuscript taking into account some but by far not all concerns
raised by the two Referees. The paper has improved regarding the clarity of the results and
presentation. However, no further experiments (as required) were carried out to solidify the
results and claims. There is a lot of assumptions and speculation, how the investigated
ribozymes interact with their substrates. The authors repeatedly discuss structure and
conformation effects. However, there are no experiments to look at these influences. In my
previous Review I have already recommended structure analysis by SHAPE, in line or
chemical probing to study the conformation and conformational changes of the ribozymes in
the presence and absence of substrates. This would help to understand how in particular the
very short ribozyme interacts with the substrate and still can support ligation. This kind of
deeper analysis is important to strengthen the paper, because the pure message that RNA
supported ligation of short fragments is possible, is nothing new.
In summary, I consider the revised version of the paper as still premature for publication and
strongly recommend further experiments towards deeper understanding of the ribozyme-
substrate interaction for ligation.
Response
Please also see our response to reviewer 1 above. We appreciate the suggestion that SHAPE,
in line or chemical probing studies on ribozyme-substrate interaction could yield more
information. A lack of structural data is a limitation of this study, however, as indicated in
responses in the previous revision, these techniques are developed for RNA molecules only.
Since, the study was carried out using substrates largely composed of DNA; the structure
probing techniques would misinterpret the ribozyme-substrate interactions. Certainly, any
interactions that are identified would not be conclusive.
We have acknowledged at the end of section on self-ligation rate on Page 9 that the detailed
analysis of catalysis geometry and the ribozyme-substrate interactions are the limitations of our
study.
