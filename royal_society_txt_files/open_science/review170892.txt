This manuscript entitled "MoO2 nanosheets embedded in amorphous carbon matrix for sodium-
ion batteries" presents the investigation of the reason for the stable cycling performance and the
high rate capability of MoO2/C nanosheets upon cycling. The results seem interesting. The
manuscript is well arranged. Therefore, I really realize that this manuscript can be accepted for
publication. There are some points that the authors might consider as listed below.
(1) It is suggested to add the XRD pattern of MoO3 to determine whether the peaks at 2<U+03B8> = 37° is
caused by MoO3.
(2) It is suggested to cite some recent references in the revised manuscript (such as, J. Mater.
Chem. A, 2017, DOI: 10.1039/C7TA01870C; J. Alloy. Compd. 2017, 710, 323; J. Mater. Chem. A,
2017, 5, 4850)
(3) If possible, please add the rate capability and cycling performance of MoO2 nanosheets for
comparison. It highly supports the conclusion that the structural design of MoO2/C nanosheets
is better.

This work investigated the synthesis and electrochemical performance of MoO2/C composite.
The results showed that the composite has a high capacity and good cycling stability for Na
storage. The work can be accepted after considering the following questions:
(1) In Fig.2, the XRD showed that there is a wide peak at 10-20o.The author should check it.
(2) As described in the experimental part, the firing temperature is 400oC. At this temperature,
the pyrolysis of glucose may be not sufficient. As a result, the conductivity may be not good. The
author should discuss it.
(3) Why there are no obvious carbon peaks in Fig.2b, since Raman is sensitive to carbon materials.
(4) The Na-storage performance should be compared with those in other work.

Responses to comments
Referee: 1
Comments:
(1) It is suggested to add the XRD pattern of MoO3 to determine whether the peaks at
2<U+03B8> = 37° is caused by MoO3.
Response: We have checked all the standard XRD patterns of MoO3 carefully. It is
shown that there is no peak at 2<U+03B8> ˜ 37°, the closet peak of MoO3 are listed below:
Chemical Formula PDF No. Crystal lattice closest peak of MoO3 to 37°
MoO3 47-1081 Monoclinic 35.028 or 41.603
MoO3 47-1320 Monoclinic 35.630 or 38.188
MoO3 21-0569 Hexagonal 35.451 or 42.049
MoO3 35-0609 Orthorhombic 35.499 or 38.559
MoO3 05-0508 Orthorhombic 35.495 or 38.575
(2) It is suggested to cite some recent references in the revised manuscript (such as, J.
Mater. Chem. A, 2017, DOI: 10.1039/C7TA01870C; J. Alloy. Compd. 2017, 710,
323; J. Mater. Chem. A, 2017, 5, 4850)
Response: The references have been added in this manuscript.(Reference 6 and 17)
(3) If possible, please add the rate capability and cycling performance of MoO2
nanosheets for comparison. It highly supports the conclusion that the structural design
of MoO2/C nanosheets is better.
Response: The MoO2/C nanosheets were synthesized by the reduction of MoO3. The
reductant is carbon decomposed from glucose. There always retains some carbon in
the sample and it is not easy to obtain pure MoO2 nanosheets in our previously
experiment. We have tried to perform this experiment several times and failed to
obtain pure MoO2 nanosheets. We will continue to accomplish this test in our future
work.

Comments:
(1) In Fig.2, the XRD showed that there is a wide peak at 10-20º.The author should
check it.
Response: Revision is made accordingly in Page 3 marked with RED.
(2) As described in the experimental part, the firing temperature is 400<U+2103>. At this
temperature, the pyrolysis of glucose may be not sufficient. As a result, the
conductivity may be not good. The author should discuss it.
Response: Revision is made accordingly in Page 4 marked with RED.
(3) Why there are no obvious carbon peaks in Fig.2b, since Raman is sensitive to
2
carbon materials.
Response: It is verified in our experiment that the intensity of metal oxides changed
dramatically with the Raman light intensity. For example, the Raman peak count of
TiO2 change from 50-10000 with the change of the Raman light intensity. But, the
peak of carbon is almost at the same value(about 200) when the Raman light intensity
change. In Fig. 2b, the Raman peak is not obvious is because that the peak of MoO2 is
so strong that the peak of carbon is nearly invisible in it (This work will be published
in our future paper).
(4) The Na-storage performance should be compared with those in other work.
Response: Revision is made accordingly in Page 2 and 4 marked with RED.
