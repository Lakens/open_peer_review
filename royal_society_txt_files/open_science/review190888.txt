Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors have addressed my comments from the previously submitted version satisfactorily.
However, I have two minor further comments on their responses that they may wish to consider:
1. In the final sentence of the abstract, is it clear what "it" refers to? Perhaps they should say
"whilst fixed-pinned shells are barely affected by a hole, the presence of a hole strongly favours
bistable inversions in roller-supported shells".
2. I find the labelling "Remark 1" a bit confusing, since it still suggests "Remark 2" is coming - the
later discussion of singularities is not labelled in the same way. Perhaps they could just not
number the remark?

Please ensure you have prepared your revision in accordance with the guidance at
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/ -- please note that we cannot
publish your manuscript without the end statements. We have included a screenshot example of
the end statements for reference. If you feel that a given heading is not relevant to your paper,
please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript before 03-Jul-2019. Please note that the revision deadline
will expire at 00.00am on this date. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date please let
me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication, you will be
asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is approved by
Royal Society Publishing. You can find out more about the charges at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please
contact openscience@royalsociety.org.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Thanks for submitting this transfer to Royal Society Open Science. Two of the reviewers from
your earlier Proceedings A submission have kindly reviewed your revised manuscript. As you
will note they are broadly in favour of publication but offer a number of minor modifications to
improve readability of the manuscript. We would recommend you incorporate these changes and
provide a point-by-point response indicating that you have done so. Congratulations on this
otherwise fine work.

Dear Mr Sobota,
I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Bistable polar-orthotropic shallow
shells" is now accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
You can expect to receive a proof of your article in the near future. Please contact the editorial
office (openscience_proofs@royalsociety.org and openscience@royalsociety.org) to let us know if
you are likely to be away from e-mail contact. Due to rapid publication and an extremely tight
schedule, if comments are not received, your paper may experience a delay in publication.
Royal Society Open Science operates under a continuous publication model

Dear editor,
please find enclosed the revision of our manuscript “Bistable Polar-Orthotropic Shallow Shells”.
All suggestions of the reviewers were implemented in the manuscript and highlighted in red colour;
previous changes are highlighted in blue, as before.
Yours sincerely,
Paul Sobota & Keith Seffen
Summary of changes:
1. The final sentence of the abstract now reads: "whilst fixed-pinned shells are barely affected by a
hole, the presence of a hole strongly favours bistable inversions in roller-supported shells".
2. Changed “Remark 1” to “Remark” (without a number)
3. Corrected a typo below Eq 2 (“Poisson’s ratio”)
4. Replaced 'extreme' with 'extremal' below Eq 10, as suggested.
5. Corrected an unformatted latex command above Eq 16
