This paper demonstrates the capacity of non-vascular mosses to augment the performance of
microbioal fuel cells. A 3-dimensional paper / carbon fiber matrix was used to enhance current
collection and provide a more robust substrate on which the moss can be grown. The results
clearly show that current output and power density can be augmented by mosses, in spite of their
lack of vasculature. I found this manuscript to be well described, and thorough. The results
demonstrate yet another opportunity for biology driven electricity generation. One particular
application that came to mind was integration of bryophyte augmented MFCs into green-roofs,
which are increasingly being mandated for new buildings in many jurisdictions.
I recommend this paper for publication after the following considerations are taken into account:
Graphs in all figures: It would be helpful to have labels for the y-axis in addition to the units
which are given.
Line 197: The authors state that the light-dark response of the bryoMFCs was less marked in the
sterile systems. I would suggest that as a fraction of the dark performance, the trend was in fact
more pronounced. For the sterile condition, the current density increased almost 100% when the
lights were turned on, compared to only 50% for the non-sterile conditions. I think this result is
worth discussing in more detail.
The paper did not report on whether or not a light dependency on current/power output was
observed for the environmental mosses. I am curious if the authors observed the same kind of
behavior in all the species tested.
I would appreciate if the authors offered more insights into what they think the role of the
bacteria are in the generation of current. Presently, the text is somewhat vague in terms of the
interaction between moss-bacteria and current generation. It is clear that there is a relationship,
but a clearer discussion on the roles each play would be helpful and tie figure 8 into the body of
the text.
The authors conclude that “bryophytes can be used in a MFC setup to generate electrical output”
(line 382). I suggest that the results indicate instead that bryophytes can be used to augment
current generation in MFC devices. The moss free samples indicated that the bacteria (non-
sterile) are capable of substantial electrogenic activity alone. Therefore, it appears that these
bacteria are the work-horses and their activity is enhanced by the photosynthesis derived
metabolites supplied by the moss. Presently, the manuscript gives the impression that the moss is
the primary player in this enterprise, but it is clear that the moss in sterile conditions is not better
than the control (fig. 7).
Line 73: Please provide a more recent estimate and reference for the fossil fuel fraction of the
estimated 2040 Total primary energy source. I suspect – unfortunately – that this estimate is still
accurate, but would be good to update the ref.
Please edit the manuscript carefully for grammatical errors.
In summary, a very original, and memorable work that warrants publication here, once the above
are addressed.

The submitted manuscript concerns the development of the Bryophyte-MFC. The Bryophyte-
MFC belongs to the so called Plant-MFC which principles are based on the interactions between
bacteria colonizing the plant rhizosphere and the anode of the bioelectrochemical system.
Before publication the manuscript have to be significantly reworked for its improvement. A lot of
technical specifications are described but the scientific part of the analyses requires additional
methods and explanations. The exposition of the manuscript can be provisionally divided into
two parts - the first one includes analyses of moss Physcomitrella patens and the second one – the
use of mixed moss species for charging a consumer. However, due to the used different fuel cell
constructions, used different mosses and the obtained electrical parameters , which differ with
more than an order of magnitude, I don`t see the connection between the two groups of
experiments as if they are made chaotically. As far as the established current density (40-80
µA/m2) and achieved power (1-3µW/m2) generated by P. patens, independently of the used
substrate, is too low for charging a battery/consumer this part does not fit the title of the
manuscript “Electrical output of bryophyte microbial fuel cell (bryoMFC) systems is sufficient to
power a radio or an environmental sensor”.
Before publication I would recommend the following:
In the Abstract:
The abstract have to contain the main research achievements of the study and not its aim. With
the “sterile/non sterile experiments” only the principle of the plant microbial fuel cell is
confirmed. This could be commented in the text but is not innovative for the scientists working in
the field of the microbial fuel cells. The “one order of magnitude higher” power achieved with
Bryo-MFC under non sterile conditions is marked in the abstract. In the same time the given
value, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher is not explained.
4
Keywords: The processes of photosynthesis are not investigated or explained in details in the
text. The “photosynthesis” has to be omitted from the keywords.
In the Introduction part
Some of the citied papers are rather old. Newer references will bring the audience up-to-date. For
instance, instead of Ref.18. “Park, D.H., Laivenieks, M., Guettler, M.V., Jain, M.K. & Zeikus, J.G.
Applied And Environmental Microbiology 65 (7): 2912-2917 (1999).” “Extracellular electron
transfer in yeast–based biofuel cells: a review. Bioelectrochemistry (2015), 106: 177–185” …
Page 109-110 – Requires revision. The first construction of a developed Bryophyte –MFC was
reported on the First International Powerplant Symposium, Gent, Belgium in 2011 and published
as short communication “Bacterial mutalism in the mosses roots applicable in Bryophyta-
microbial fuel cell “ in Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences 76 (2): 63-
65.
In the Results part:
Page 5, lines 123-124 The term “anodic electron conductive substrate” is confusing. Was this mix
of paper and carbon fibre (on the photo SF7 it seems like a carbon cloth) used as a medium for
growing the mosses and the same time as anode? If yes, what is happening after its exhausting or
degradation? No corrosion tests are given for the stability of the matrixes over time.
This part begins with a suppl. figure and not with an important scientific result. The description
of the samples and their preparation belongs to Material and methods part and has to be omitted
from the results (page 6 lines 126-131)
Fig. 2 g has to be discussed. More explanation are needed for describing the photosynthetic
parameters and CO2 draw down converted to a per unit chlorophyll basis. I couldn`t find these
results described in the Material and methods part.
Page 8 lines 209-212 – In Materials and methods
Page 10 lines 231-237 These explanations belong to Materials and methods part, not to Results
part.
p.10, l. 245-248: The authors reported that with 10 connected in series bryoMFCs, utilizing
environmental samples of moss, they charged for 10 hours a rechargeable battery with a nominal
voltage of 3.6V, which after that was able to power a commercial radio for 80 seconds. I wonder
to what extend the battery was discharged before charging? How did they approve this? Detailed
evidences should be presented in the paper.
Fig.6 c,d are established previously and are not new (http://mosspower.tumblr.com/ ,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WMpUS9iAI published online on 12.02.2014
Fig. 8 is too common and repeats a lot of schemes in already published papers demonstrating the
pMFC principles. Both should be omitted from the manuscript.
The analyses of the part “Current and power density in bryoMFCs operated with environmental
samples of moss ” are actually presented only by a polarization and power curve ,which for my
opinion is not sufficient for scientific study.
The controls toward biocompatibilities are made using BCD medium, and the BryoMFC are
made only with water. Why?
5
Because of the lack of polarization curves, obtained with Physcomitrella patens, it is not clear
why these BryoMFCs show such low outputs. What is the internal resistance of this system?
The Discussion part has to be revised. It repeats the aim of the study, and describes, what was
done again (page 11, lines 256-266).
The statistical method used is described in the Material and methods part. There is no need to be
mentioned every time – lines 275, 279, 292, 299 etc.
Line 336- In the results part and the figures is written “steril” conditions and in the discussion
part “near-sterile conditions”? Needs unification. In my opinion the second is more appropriate.
Page 15, lines 365-371 – These comments are not connected with the scope of the study.
In section Analytical techniques (p.20) the authors describe that the polarization curves were
generated by applying 8 external loads (Rext) from 1 M<U+2126> to 4.7k<U+2126> (1 M<U+2126>; 470k, 200k, 100k, 47k,
489 15k, 10, and 4.6 k<U+2126>). However, on the only polarization curve, presented in Fig. 6a there are
much more points! How they were generated?!
From economical point of view it is acceptable to use tissue paper as a separator between the
anode and cathode. However, I strongly doubt about its stability in the water environment even
for few hours operation. I need more description about this.
And last but not least:
-The Fig. captions are too long.
-The Suppl. material has to be revised. For instance, the photo presented as SF4. (“Bicycle
shed…”) is for personal collection…

mandated for new buildings in many jurisdictions.
I recommend this paper for publication after the following considerations are taken into account:
Graphs in all figures: It would be helpful to have labels for the y-axis in addition to the units which are
given.
All done
-2-
Line 197: The authors state that the light-dark response of the bryoMFCs was less marked in the
sterile systems. I would suggest that as a fraction of the dark performance, the trend was in fact more
pronounced. For the sterile condition, the current density increased almost 100% when the lights were
turned on, compared to only 50% for the non-sterile conditions. I think this result is worth discussing in
more detail.
This observation has been expanded upon in the Results and Discussion sections (pages 8 &
12)
The paper did not report on whether or not a light dependency on current/power output was observed
for the environmental mosses. I am curious if the authors observed the same kind of behavior in all
the species tested.
The environmental species of mosses were not tested for light dependency by individual pots
or by individual species. This would have been a major undertaking beyond the scope of this
paper. We have limited data on the pots of environmental species, but they do not add
significantly to the conclusions of the paper, so we do not propose to include them here.
-3-
I would appreciate if the authors offered more insights into what they think the role of the bacteria are
n the generation of current. Presently, the text is somewhat vague in terms of the interaction between
moss-bacteria and current generation. It is clear that there is a relationship, but a clearer discussion
on the roles each play would be helpful and tie figure 8 into the body of the text.
The interactions between moss and microorganisms, and the role of microorganisms in
current generation, are now discussed in more detail in the Discussion section (pag. 13)
-4-
The authors conclude that “bryophytes can be used in a MFC setup to generate electrical output”
(line 382). I suggest that the results indicate instead that bryophytes can be used to augment current
generation in MFC devices. The moss free samples indicated that the bacteria (non-sterile) are
capable of substantial electrogenic activity alone. Therefore, it appears that these bacteria are the
work-horses and their activity is enhanced by the photosynthesis derived metabolites supplied by the
moss. Presently, the manuscript gives the impression that the moss is the primary player in this
enterprise, but it is clear that the moss in sterile conditions is not better than the control (fig. 7).
We had endeavoured to make this point in the Discussion section by saying that the “P.
patens is unable to generate electrical output independent of bacteria” and “bryoMFC systems
should be operated under non-sterile conditions”, but have clarified the wording there and in
the final paragraph

Line 73: Please provide a more recent estimate and reference for the fossil fuel fraction of the
estimated 2040 Total primary energy source. I suspect – unfortunately – that this estimate is still
accurate, but would be good to update the ref.
This reference has been updated in the main body of the manuscript and in the reference list.

In summary, a very original, and memorable work that warrants publication here, once the above are
addressed.

Comments to the Author(s)
The submitted manuscript concerns the development of the Bryophyte-MFC. The Bryophyte-MFC
belongs to the so called Plant-MFC which principles are based on the interactions between bacteria
colonizing the plant rhizosphere and the anode of the bioelectrochemical
system.

Before publication the manuscript have to be significantly reworked for its improvement. A lot of
technical specifications are described but the scientific part of the analyses requires additional
methods and explanations. The exposition of the manuscript can be provisionally divided into two
parts - the first one includes analyses of moss Physcomitrella patens and the second one – the use of
mixed moss species for charging a consumer. However, due to the used different fuel cell
constructions, used different mosses and the obtained electrical parameters, which differ with more
than an order of magnitude, I don`t see the connection between the two groups of experiments as if
they are made chaotically. As far as the established current density (40-80 µA/m2) and achieved
power (1-3µW/m2) generated by P. patens, independently of the used substrate, is too low for
charging a battery/consumer this part does not fit the title of the manuscript “Electrical output of
bryophyte microbial fuel cell (bryoMFC) systems is sufficient to power a radio or an environmental
sensor”.
bryophyte microbial fuel cell (bryoMFC) systems IS sufficient to power a radio or an
environmental sensor”. We did not claim that “Electrical output of bryophyte microbial fuel
cell (bryoMFC) systems operating with Physcomitrella patens etc…”. We believe that the
experiments described in the paper form a natural progression, and disagree that the
organization is ‘chaotic’. We note that reviewer 1 did not indicate concern over this. If the
Editor decides we need to change the title, we will.
Before publication I would recommend the following:

In the Abstract:
The abstract have to contain the main research achievements of the study and not its aim. With the
“sterile/non sterile experiments” only the principle of the plant microbial fuel cell is confirmed. This
could be commented in the text but is not innovative for the scientists working in the field of the
microbial fuel cells. The “one order of magnitude higher” power achieved with Bryo-MFC under non
sterile conditions is marked in the abstract. In the same time the given value, which is 3 orders of
magnitude higher is not explained.
We believe the information set out in the Abstract is appropriate, but would be happy to
modify it if the Editor’s view is that it does not conform to house style. A discussion of the
possible reasons for difference in power density between the environmental samples and P.
patens would not be appropriate in the Abstract, but we have added a comment to that effect
on page 15.

Keywords: The processes of photosynthesis are not investigated or explained in details in the text.
The “photosynthesis” has to be omitted from the keywords.
The term “photosynthesis” has been omitted and replaced with “plant microbial fuel cell”.

In the Introduction part
Some of the cited papers are rather old. Newer references will bring the audience up-to-date. For
nstance, instead of Ref.18. “Park, D.H., Laivenieks, M., Guettler, M.V., Jain, M.K. & Zeikus, J.G.
Applied And Environmental Microbiology 65 (7): 2912-2917 (1999).” “Extracellular electron transfer in
yeast–based biofuel cells: a review. Bioelectrochemistry (2015), 106: 177–185” …
We have included a reference to Hubenova and Mitov’s review, as requested by the referee.

Page 109-110 – Requires revision. The first construction of a developed Bryophyte –MFC was
reported on the First International Powerplant Symposium, Gent, Belgium in 2011 and published as
short communication “Bacterial mutalism in the mosses roots applicable in Bryophyta-microbial fuel
cell “ in Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences 76 (2): 63-65.
We are not clear to what extent these conference reports were formally reviewed, but the text
has been modified accordingly (pag 5), and the reference to Hubenova’s work has been added
in the reference list.

In the Results part:
paper and carbon fibre (on the photo SF7 it seems like a carbon cloth) used as a medium for growing
the mosses and the same time as anode? If yes, what is happening after its exhausting or
degradation? No corrosion tests are given for the stability of the matrixes over time.
The paper was used as a substrate for growing the moss, but not to provide nutrients. At page
16 in Materials and Methods is clearly written that “Sections of the samples of composite matrix,
approximately 4 cm by 3 cm (12 cm2), were placed into 100 mm petri dishes with 10 ml of BCD
medium”. Therefore, the medium is BCD. The cellulose-degrading properties of moss are not,
at best of our knowledge, reported. Therefore, the Anodic matrix is not expected to be
consumed over time, and Fig 5 shows the devices functioned effectively for 70 days.
In addition, in the figure 8, the anodic matrix on which a layer of moss 70 days old is growing,
seems to be unaffected by the presence of the moss.

This part begins with a suppl. figure and not with an important scientific result. The description of the
samples and their preparation belongs to Material and methods part and has to be omitted from the
results (page 6 lines 126-131)
Some of this information has been now moved to Materials and Methods. However, not to
explain first that we used matrices with a range of paper:carbon ratios would make the
immediately following comparison of how plants performed on the different matrices very
confusing, so some description of the experimental design is unavoidable.

Fig. 2 g has to be discussed. More explanation are needed for describing the photosynthetic
parameters and CO2 draw down converted to a per unit chlorophyll basis. I couldn`t find these results
described in the Material and methods part.
The explanation in the Materials and Methods has been expanded.

The text has been modified to incorporate this suggestion. These lines have been included in
Materials and Methods.

Page 10 lines 231-237 These explanations belong to Materials and methods part, not to Results part.
The text has been modified to incorporate this suggestion, though we feel it appropriate at
least to mention that there were six different species in the environmental samples. The rest of
the description has been included in Materials and Methods.

p.10, l. 245-248: The authors reported that with 10 connected in series bryoMFCs, utilizing
environmental samples of moss, they charged for 10 hours a rechargeable battery with a nominal
voltage of 3.6V, which after that was able to power a commercial radio for 80 seconds.
I wonder to what extend the battery was discharged before charging? How did they approve this?
Detailed evidences should be presented in the paper.
The battery was discharged by connecting across a 100 ohm resistor for 24 hours, and its
inability to power the radio confirmed directly. Details of this have been added (page 22)

The devices described in the above links were developed by members of our team (co-authors
of this manuscript). Figures 6 c,d are important illustrations of bryoMFC applications and
strengthen the manuscript. The links are for popular science communication, and do not
represent peer-reviewed publication. The second link has also been included in the reference
list

Fig. 8 is too common and repeats a lot of schemes in already published papers demonstrating the
pMFC principles. Both should be omitted from the manuscript.
Figure 8 has not been published elsewhere. Omitting it and describing the system in words
would, in our view, be unhelpful.

The analyses of the part “Current and power density in bryoMFCs operated with environmental
samples of moss” are actually presented only by a polarization and power curve which for my opinion
s not sufficient for scientific study.
Polarization and power curves are standard electrochemical characterization techniques for
microbial fuel cells. Chronoamperometry has been also performed and is presented in figures
3 and 4. In addition, in this scientific study we have also developed and characterised a novel
anodic matrix. We are somewhat surprised by the referee’s view that a polarization and power
curve, alongside with all other results, are not sufficient for a scientific study when the study
by Hubenova and Mitov that the referee requested us to cite did not include these
measurements, and showed only simple measurements of voltage and current density over
time.

The controls toward biocompatibilities are made using BCD medium, and the BryoMFC are made only
with water. Why?
90 ml of BCD medium was introduced into the bryoMFC during inoculation, as described in
Materials and Methods. The referee may have overlooked this.
-15-
Because of the lack of polarization curves, obtained with Physcomitrella patens, it is not clear why
these BryoMFCs show such low outputs. What is the internal resistance of this system?
Examples of polarization curves for non sterile (black line) and near-sterile (red line), obtained
with Physcomitrella patens have been added in the supplementary material (SF4). From the
polarization curve, the internal resistance as derived from the V/I ratios for the non-sterile and
near-sterile sample were 1.32 and 4.39 kO respectively. We have now speculated in the
discussion on why the P. patens systems give lower outputs than the environmental samples.
-16-
The Discussion part has to be revised. It repeats the aim of the study, and describes, what was done
again (page 11, lines 256-266).
This has been revised.
-17-
The statistical method used is described in the Material and methods part. There is no need to be
mentioned every time – lines 275, 279, 292, 299 etc.
The term “ANOVA” in the Discussion section is removed and references to the ANOVA are
directed to Supplementary Table 1.
-18-
Line 336- In the results part and the figures is written “steril” conditions and in the discussion part
“near-sterile conditions”? Needs unification. In my opinion the second is more appropriate.
We agree with the reviewer. The term “sterile” has been replaced with “near-sterile” in the text
and legends for the figures.
-19-
Page 15, lines 365-371 – These comments are not connected with the scope of the study.
Whilst these comments are not directly related to the scope of the study, it is nevertheless
important to maximize the value of environmental technologies like bryoMFCs and hence,
additional applications such as bioremediation need to be explored simultaneously with
electrical power generation. We therefore believe these comments are appropriate in the
Discussion section.

In section Analytical techniques (p.20) the authors describe that the polarization curves were
generated by applying 8 external loads (Rext) from 1 MO to 4.7kO (1 MO; 470k, 200k, 100k, 47k, 489
15k, 10, and 4.6 kO). However, on the only polarization curve, presented in Fig. 6a there are much
more points! How they were generated?!
The external loads described were used to generate polarization curves for P. patens
bryoMFCs. To generate polarization curves for environmental samples of moss a potentiostat
was used. We have added this to the Materials and Methods, and thank the referee for pointing
it out.

From economical point of view it is acceptable to use tissue paper as a separator between the anode
and cathode. However, I strongly doubt about its stability in the water environment even for few hours
operation. I need more description about this.
The tissue paper has been tested for several days and no apparent problem has been
observed. More advanced material(s) might be consider for further studies.

-The Fig. captions are too long.
Figure captions have been shortened.
-23-
-The Suppl. material has to be revised. For instance, the photo presented as SF4. (“Bicycle shed…”)
s for personal collection…
We felt it appropriate to present the location where the environmental samples were collected,
to provide as much experimental information as possible. We leave it to the Editor to decide if
we should remove it.
