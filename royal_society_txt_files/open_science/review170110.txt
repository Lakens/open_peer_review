This is a study undertaken reasonably competently (with some oversights that can be rectified at
this stage), and the co-authors are respectable and knowledgable scientists (I am not familiar with
the lead author yet). It has also been undertaken for the right reasons. Taken for what it is (and
with some clarifications to my queries, which simply apply common sense biologically), it is a
valid and publishable study, and I am thus recommending that it be published. What it is not
(and is leaning currently towards being) is a study that should extrapolate behaviour of animals
to anticipated reaction to a full scale, commercial seismic survey, and therefore it is of limited
usefulness in getting any closer to answering the burning question we need to address: are full
seismic surveys detrimental to porpoises? For this reason, the title is misleading, and really
should be changed from its current status. I outline my reasoning below:
Title & Introduction: I have made a few minor grammatical suggestions to the English, having
learned a lot from a proofing editor for a book, and they improve the 'flow' of writing
immeasurably. Trivialities aside, firstly, there is no description on what a commercial seismic
survey is. Have the authors been on an actual seismic survey or worked in the industry before?
Readers need to know how a full-scale seismic survey is undertaken to place this small-scale
experimental study into context, in order that the non-expert can understand why the experiment
is nothing like a commercial survey (nor is it supposed to be, and nor should it be extrapolated to
be for various reasons explained later). So the title really ought to be changed to reflect what it is:
Evidence of long-term displacement of individual harbour porpoises exposed to short-term single
seismic airgun noise.
Seismic surveys move in pre-determined transect lines, have large and noisy source vessels, with
noisy flanking guard vessels (depending on survey 2-5 vessels, sometimes more), coupled with
long (e.g. 14 km) streamers, and full airgun source arrays, firing sometimes in a 'flip-flop'
formation, with frequent periods of operational downtime, interspersed with test firing.
Depending on type of survey (Ocean Bottom Cable, 2D, 3D, Vertical Seismic Profile, VSP etc.),
they can be preceded by a lot of noisy activity in the region (vessels, positioning equipment,
ROVs etc.) prior to (weeks to months, and in some cases years) the actual survey. Moreover, in
terms of typical, ship-based seismic surveys in the North sea, there is an obligatory preceding
ramp-up procedure (albeit the effectiveness of which is being disputed currently - see latest
AN2016 abstracts and posters). Seismic surveys are heard by animals over long distances, thus
presumably giving warning to animals that the survey is commencing somewhere in their
vicinity, even if noise directionality is difficult to ascertain underwater.
The intro, as is stands currently, implies that the authors have undertaken their research with a
preconceived view that seismic surveys are detrimental to all marine mammal species. I'm not
disputing this, as this may well be the case as more studies emerge, but there are some competent
studies, undertaken by unbiased academics on government funding that show little or no effect,
and these must also be listed in the introduction to present a balanced view (I have added some
comments to this effect, but the authors will know these studies). I note, with surprise, that this is
windfarm funding, and while I am not questioning the validity of the study, windfarm
companies inevitably want to see a detrimental outcome. This especially holds true in Germany,
where the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) have produced legally binding regulations based
on data provided by Lucke et al. (2009) of a dual noise criterion of 160 dB re 1 µPa²s Sound
Exposure Level (SEL) and 190 dB re 1 µPa² (peak to peak Sound Pressure Level, SPL) that can
not be exceeded at a distance of 750 m from the source (described by de Jong et al. (2011)).
Effectively, there is a LOT of politics in Europe on this, and the authors really need to ensure that
3
they themselves have made every endeavour to give an unbiased argument. Commence
unbiased, set the scene, and move on.
In any study, it is important to dial out and see the bigger picture, as it influences methodological
design. Whether we like it or not, harbour porpoises have been living with seismic surveys for
generations (good or bad for them, probably latter, time will tell). In an evolutionary sense, this
means that porpoises (especially in the North Sea) experience seismic surveys on a regular basis,
generationally. Indeed, given typical porpoise life expectancy in the wild, the majority of the
North Sea population has probably never experienced anything other than these types of surveys
(think: hey mummy, what's that awful sound? It's a seismic survey honey, it's going to get noisy
etc.). So, applying natural selection, it is highly probable that populations of porpoises should
have learned to recognise the noise signatures of typical seismic surveys, and 'expect' what's
coming their way. This is super important when deriving inferences from these sorts of short-
term, attenuated source, experimental studies.
Methods. How was the airgun deployed? On commercial surveys, animals are warned with a
ramp up. Firstly, while we have known this for years in bats, Paul Nachtigall's recent work on
acoustic dampening (Nachtigall, P. E. & Supin, A. Y. Conditioned hearing sensitivity reduction in
a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). J. Exp. Biol. 217, 2806-2813, doi:10.1242/jeb.104091
(2014)) has shown that animals, with prior warning of a noise source, can physically reduce their
hearing by up to 15 dB, which can last up to 3 days. In this study, porpoises within the 500 m
vicinity of the single airgun exposure receive no prior warning that they will be exposed to a
sound source they have never heard before (a single gun) in a region that has never had this kind
of 'single airgun' noise before, and from a small vessel that doesn't typically exhibit a noise
signature that includes an airgun, and thus they are not expecting that kind of vessel to produce
that kind of noise (it doesn't actually say in the methods that the source was deployed from a
vessel, and should, unless I'm missing something). So firstly, we have to assume that the
dampening effect could have been applied here should the animals have been forewarned.
Animals thus only got a chance to apply this method of minimising self exposure (if possible) on
the second presented pulse. Moreover, the animals had no idea that a seismic exposure would
occur in the region (none of the acoustic 'signature' of a full scale seismic survey have been
presented, since there are no surveys going on in the region - we have to assume that the authors
have controlled for this, and if not, why not - state it somewhere, it's important), so any perceived
reactions to the gun could be for any reason other than what the authors want to prove (that
seismic surveys are detrimental to porpoises). This especially holds true, since we now know
cetaceans react to types of noise, not necessarily because they are likely to hurt them, but because
they are startled by being presented noises out of context, or simply sounds that are alien (e.g.
Bahamas Range work). Suddenly playing an alien sound (because one gun does not sound
anything like a full commercial array) to an animal in their normal home-range field conditions
with no prior history of this type of sound in their soundscape, from a vessel that's not supposed
to 'sound' like that, with no prior warning is bound to elicit a reaction. And, of course, we must
not exclude the presence of the vessel itself (plenty of published research on the effects of vessels
on porpoises), so the airgun exposure conditions must be described in more detail. Apropos
vessel, if the same vessel was used to undertake the noise study, and catch and tag the animals,
then not only has the same vessel been used to play the sound before, but it could have been
associated with some very unpleasant experiences for animals in the region. With porpoises,
never underestimate vessels. We are not doing experiments on sea anemones here, porpoises are
intelligent, acoustic animals par excellence, and most importantly, have a memory. The authors
have become so wrapped up in the modelling, they appear to have forgotten about some very
basic biology of porpoises.
Porpoises caught were different sexes, so while the authors address body mass, they don't
address the potential of sex-based reactions, perhaps as a consequence of reproductive status
(pregnant/lactating females), and probably should. Also, within females, there are genetic
differences between northern and southern North Sea animals. This sex-related difference in
population genetic structure suggests that males disperse more than females, which show fidelity
4
to certain areas - philopatry (Teilmann has done work on this himself, so knows the references
Rosel et al 1999, Eisfeld and Kock 2006 , etc.). Again, certain individuals may have strong drives
to remain in certain areas for reproductive reasons, and thus elicit higher tolerances, which again
is probably worth mentioning and expanding upon.
Finally, probably ought to be mentioned, but while no audiograms were taken on these
individuals in the field (and really could have been, there are 'kits' available from Dorian Hauser,
and it can be done fairly quickly, although I appreciate the procedure is traumatic enough for the
individuals), there exists the possibility that some of them were 'deafer' than the others, and
therefore more 'tolerant'. This ought to be discussed as a caveat to the study.

This paper is on the behavioural response of 5 porpoises responding to acoustic signals of a
seismic airgun. These observations from the natural habitat of porpoises and with an actual
airgun (transmitting rather briefly for just one minute, instead of days or weeks) is important
information to the community of understanding this process and needed to assess the
environmental impact for managers and regulators. Focus of the study is mostly on the biology
and the behaviour of the porpoises, while from my perspective not enough attention is paid to
the acoustic component of the study. I didnt see a clear discussion on the frequency content of
the signal and the consequences of that, and also the quantities and units are not clear or
incorrect. The way of estimating the received (sound pressure?) level is debatable. This looks like
a missed opportunity, because now we see porpoises responding (which is hard to achieve) but
we dont know exactly to what they are responding to.
The introduction of the paper can be improved, and also the main research question or main aim
of the study could be better motivated. For managers and regulators, moving from population
responses to individual responses seems a step back rather than moving forward. What exactly is
the detailed individual response adding here?
I would suggest this should be addressed, and I think the acoustic component of the study needs
more attention. Maybe some additional modelling could provide better estimates of the actual
5
exposure, and including the frequency distribution of the signal in combination with weighting
functions (e.g. the new NOAA definitions for this) could potentially remove a considerable
amount of uncertainty in the study.
Some more specific remarks are provided below, referring to the line numbers of the document
including some text with track changes.
Line 25:
I have no clue what this 195 dB re 1 uPa is supposed to express. Is it an attempt to represent
Source Level? That is a common (and well defined) term for sonar sources, but than the units are
different (dB re 1 uPa m), also expressing the source has been calculated back to a point source
and the sound pressure level expressed at 1m distance from that point source. Using Source Level
however is not recommended for impulsive sound sources. Mostly sound exposure levels (SEL)
or peak-to-peak sound pressure levels (SPL) are used. This is done in several other studies, both
in the field (e.g. Thompson et al.2013, your ref.11) or with captive animals (e.g. recent paper by
Reichmuth et al.2016 JASA, 140, 2646).
Because of the change in frequency distribution at different ranges (and different environments),
the source level might also not be that relevant. In this case an indication of the strength of the
airgun, normally expressed by volume (typically in cubic inches) and operating pressure would
be sufficient.
Line 27:
Sound level is not defined, I am presuming sound pressure level is meant here.
Furthermore, for the numbers, I am not convinced these levels are correctly estimated (see
below), and are at this stage mostly a guess. If the acoustics is better treated the accuracy could be
improved and potentially some uncertainty can be reduced here.
Line 32:
I dont understand what both is referring to here. In the above 2+1 animals are mentioned.
Lines 41-42:
from this list I would say that underwater explosions (or clearance of UXO) are missing. I didnt
check if this is also not mentioned in refs[1/2/3/4]. A recent report on impact of explosions is
provided in Von Benda-Beckmann et al.(2015) Aq.Mammals, 41(4), 503. For the North Sea an
overview and ranking of sound sources is provided in Ainslie et al.(2009) TNO-report TNO-DV
2009 C085.
Line 46:
largely restricted to .. sonar... By now there is also quite some literature on the effects of pile
driving sounds, especially for the effects on porpoises. For porpoises I think there are more
papers on the effects of pile driving than on the effects of (military) sonar.
Line 47:
Not sure these references are just examples. If it should list all the species studied to date, several
references can be added, e.g. Miller et al.(2012), Isojunno et al.(2016), Sivle et al. (2015). These
references would include the following species: killer whales, pilot whales, sperm whales,
humpback whales and minke whales.
Line 50:
Is Source sound level the same as source level? The latter is much better defined. For the first,
I dont know what it means or what definition can be referred to.
Line 57:
almost excusively : is ref.[13] the only exception where I think I recall that tagged sperm whale
data is reported?
6
Line 103:
Is there any reference of these field recordings of the propagation..? This sounds very relevant
to support the estimation method used below.
Lines 104-105:
Here reference is made to Source Level (SL), but not with usual definition, and incorrect unit.
This would normally be dB re 1 uPa m (sometimes also dB re 1 uPa @1m).
Lines 109-110:
Propagation loss is assumed to follow 17 log(range). Reference is made to [21], but this doesnt
explain the choice of 17, where in [21] a range of 16-19 is mentioned, and 18 is mentioned in the
abstract. Note that in Thompson et al. (ref.11), they found values between 21 and 24.
Also in this part of the text no reference is made to the frequency distribution of the signal, while
this is a substantial component of the analysis in ref.[21], including the high-pass filtering effect of
the shallow water environment, and the frequency weighting of the signal. In particular, given
that high frequency components can differ a lot for different type of airguns, it would be
interested to look at the frequency weighted SEL values, e.g. using the recent NOAA weighting
function or audiogram.
Line 116:
What is received sound level? Is this received sound pressure level? Also
Line 133:
To my knowledge the SI unit for seconds is s (not sec). For meters we use m (not mtr).
Lines 189-190:
An important remark to make here, is that there is no (tag) data available before the tagging
attempt/activity, only data is recorded (obviously) after the tag is placed. This is different for the
seismic response, where (tag) data before the exposure is available. Note that the distance
quantity as a range (r>0) is a bit of a weird one: it can never decrease after the release if you start
the release of the animals at r=0, the animal will always swim somewhere, which is automatically
defined as an avoidance away from the release position. But maybe I am missing the point here.
Note that maybe the recent paper by Visser et al.(2016) Scientific reports 6, 28641, could be
relevant here, where the effect of tagging could be compared with different stimuli, using a
protocol to have (visual) data available also before the tagging activity. But here the tagging (of
pilot whales) is different and without capturing the animals.
Line 273:
Did I miss the analysis of fine-scale behaviour? I would say there is not that much attention to
fine scale aspects, only the statistical characteristics of it. But maybe I am not appreciating the
statistical analysis well enough here.
Line 276:
Not sure what is meant with this behavioural gradient here
Line 286:
Several hours. I would say days or weeks typically.
Lines 301-310:
I agree on this statement.
Line 324:
Has this relative risk been defined? Why is an airgun a risk at all?
7
Line 371:
Not sure why some obvious references are missing. I would say the Southall et al.(2007) paper is
relevant, as is the Lucke et al.(2009) paper with TTS in porpoises by airgun sound. Also any
references to PCAD/PCOD Population consequences of (acoustic) disturbance) is missing; work
by Costa, Harwood, New, etc. The latter seems relevant to last para of discussion (lines 333-341).

In any study, it is important to dial out and see the bigger picture, as it influences methodological

Methods. How was the airgun deployed? On commercial surveys, animals are warned with a
ramp up. Firstly, while we have known this for years in bats, Paul Nachtigall's recent work on
acoustic dampening (Nachtigall, P. E. & Supin, A. Y. Conditioned hearing sensitivity reduction in
a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). J. Exp. Biol. 217, 2806-2813, doi:10.1242/jeb.104091
(2014)) has shown that animals, with prior warning of a noise source, can physically reduce their
hearing by up to 15 dB, which can last up to 3 days. In this study, porpoises within the 500 m
vicinity of the single airgun exposure receive no prior warning that they will be exposed to a
sound source they have never heard before (a single gun) in a region that has never had this kind
of 'single airgun' noise before, and from a small vessel that doesn't typically exhibit a noise
signature that includes an airgun, and thus they are not expecting that kind of vessel to produce
that kind of noise (it doesn't actually say in the methods that the source was deployed from a

dampening effect could have been applied here should the animals have been forewarned.
Animals thus only got a chance to apply this method of minimising self exposure (if possible) on
the second presented pulse. Moreover, the animals had no idea that a seismic exposure would

not exclude the presence of the vessel itself (plenty of published research on the effects of vessels
on porpoises), so the airgun exposure conditions must be described in more detail. Apropos
vessel, if the same vessel was used to undertake the noise study, and catch and tag the animals,
then not only has the same vessel been used to play the sound before, but it could have been
associated with some very unpleasant experiences for animals in the region. With porpoises,
never underestimate vessels. We are not doing experiments on sea anemones here, porpoises are
intelligent, acoustic animals par excellence, and most importantly, have a memory. The authors
have become so wrapped up in the modelling, they appear to have forgotten about some very

Porpoises caught were different sexes, so while the authors address body mass, they don't

exposure, and including the frequency distribution of the signal in combination with weighting
functions (e.g. the new NOAA definitions for this) could potentially remove a considerable
amount of uncertainty in the study.
Some more specific remarks are provided below, referring to the line numbers of the document
including some text with track changes.
Line 25:
I have no clue what this 195 dB re 1 uPa is supposed to express. Is it an attempt to represent
Source Level? That is a common (and well defined) term for sonar sources, but than the units are
different (dB re 1 uPa m), also expressing the source has been calculated back to a point source
and the sound pressure level expressed at 1m distance from that point source. Using Source Level
however is not recommended for impulsive sound sources. Mostly sound exposure levels (SEL)
or peak-to-peak sound pressure levels (SPL) are used. This is done in several other studies, both
in the field (e.g. Thompson et al.2013, your ref.11) or with captive animals (e.g. recent paper by
Reichmuth et al.2016 JASA, 140, 2646).
Because of the change in frequency distribution at different ranges (and different environments),
the source level might also not be that relevant. In this case an indication of the strength of the
airgun, normally expressed by volume (typically in cubic inches) and operating pressure would
be sufficient.
Line 27:
Sound level is not defined, I am presuming sound pressure level is meant here.
Furthermore, for the numbers, I am not convinced these levels are correctly estimated (see
below), and are at this stage mostly a guess. If the acoustics is better treated the accuracy could be
improved and potentially some uncertainty can be reduced here.
11
Line 32:
I dont understand what both is referring to here. In the above 2+1 animals are mentioned.
Lines 41-42:
from this list I would say that underwater explosions (or clearance of UXO) are missing. I didnt
check if this is also not mentioned in refs[1/2/3/4]. A recent report on impact of explosions is
provided in Von Benda-Beckmann et al.(2015) Aq.Mammals, 41(4), 503. For the North Sea an
overview and ranking of sound sources is provided in Ainslie et al.(2009) TNO-report TNO-DV
2009 C085.
Line 46:
largely restricted to .. sonar... By now there is also quite some literature on the effects of pile
driving sounds, especially for the effects on porpoises. For porpoises I think there are more
papers on the effects of pile driving than on the effects of (military) sonar.
Line 47:
Not sure these references are just examples. If it should list all the species studied to date, several
references can be added, e.g. Miller et al.(2012), Isojunno et al.(2016), Sivle et al. (2015). These
references would include the following species: killer whales, pilot whales, sperm whales,
humpback whales and minke whales.
Line 50:
Is Source sound level the same as source level? The latter is much better defined. For the first,
I dont know what it means or what definition can be referred to.
Line 57:
almost excusively : is ref.[13] the only exception where I think I recall that tagged sperm whale
data is reported?
Line 103:
Is there any reference of these field recordings of the propagation..? This sounds very relevant
to support the estimation method used below.
Lines 104-105:
Here reference is made to Source Level (SL), but not with usual definition, and incorrect unit.
This would normally be dB re 1 uPa m (sometimes also dB re 1 uPa @1m).
Lines 109-110:
Propagation loss is assumed to follow 17 log(range). Reference is made to [21], but this doesnt
explain the choice of 17, where in [21] a range of 16-19 is mentioned, and 18 is mentioned in the
abstract. Note that in Thompson et al. (ref.11), they found values between 21 and 24.
Also in this part of the text no reference is made to the frequency distribution of the signal, while
this is a substantial component of the analysis in ref.[21], including the high-pass filtering effect of
the shallow water environment, and the frequency weighting of the signal. In particular, given
that high frequency components can differ a lot for different type of airguns, it would be
interested to look at the frequency weighted SEL values, e.g. using the recent NOAA weighting
function or audiogram.
Line 116:
What is received sound level? Is this received sound pressure level? Also
Line 133:
To my knowledge the SI unit for seconds is s (not sec). For meters we use m (not mtr).
12
Lines 189-190:
An important remark to make here, is that there is no (tag) data available before the tagging
attempt/activity, only data is recorded (obviously) after the tag is placed. This is different for the
seismic response, where (tag) data before the exposure is available. Note that the distance
quantity as a range (r>0) is a bit of a weird one: it can never decrease after the release if you start
the release of the animals at r=0, the animal will always swim somewhere, which is automatically
defined as an avoidance away from the release position. But maybe I am missing the point here.
Note that maybe the recent paper by Visser et al.(2016) Scientific reports 6, 28641, could be
relevant here, where the effect of tagging could be compared with different stimuli, using a
protocol to have (visual) data available also before the tagging activity. But here the tagging (of
pilot whales) is different and without capturing the animals.
Line 273:
Did I miss the analysis of fine-scale behaviour? I would say there is not that much attention to
fine scale aspects, only the statistical characteristics of it. But maybe I am not appreciating the
statistical analysis well enough here.
Line 276:
Not sure what is meant with this behavioural gradient here
Line 286:
Several hours. I would say days or weeks typically.
Lines 301-310:
I agree on this statement.
Line 324:
Has this relative risk been defined? Why is an airgun a risk at all?
Line 371:
Not sure why some obvious references are missing. I would say the Southall et al.(2007) paper is
relevant, as is the Lucke et al.(2009) paper with TTS in porpoises by airgun sound. Also any
references to PCAD/PCOD Population consequences of (acoustic) disturbance) is missing; work
by Costa, Harwood, New, etc. The latter seems relevant to last para of discussion (lines 333-341).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have improved the manuscript substantially. Most of the comments have been
incorporated in the updated version. I have to admit that I still regret the quantification of the
acoustics has been ignored to such a large extent, which I think is a missed opportunity for this
study. Very valuable and unique behavioural data is collected, showing the response to a
stimulus that is not quantified in great detail and is estimated in a very crude way and in large
contrast to the finescale detail of the behavioural data.
The authors have done effort to demonstrate the validity of the estimation of the acoustic
stimulus. It is much clearer now where the number come from, as it is included in the paper itself
(fig.1). Nevertheless it is still a very crude way of estimating these numbers. It is debatable how
similar the actual environment is to the reference environment of Hermannsen et al.(2015) to the
area of the 5 released porpoises. In Hermannsen et al this was stated about this environment:
Recordings of airgun noise were obtained at sea state 0 in Aarhus Bay (along a line from 56°
07.45N, 10°18.24E to 56°06.74N, 10°19.11E) over a sandy bottom with a uniform water depth
of 15 m (± 0.2 m).
For the actual areas only the water depth (named bathymetry in table 1) is provided. Most water
depths are much deeper than the reference region, and no mentioning is made about the
uniformity, bottom/sediment type or sea state, which will all affect the propagation of the sound
to some extent.
As far as I could see, the acoustic units that are used are not properly introduced (lines 132-134).
Some symbols are used, but it is not clear what quantities are introduced here. It appears that the
same quantities are used as in Hermannsen et al (2015), but then also these quantities should be
introduced properly at least once. Hopefully this kind of confusion can soon be overcome with
the new ISO-standard that should be published within a couple of days/weeks from now:
ISO 18405 Underwater Acoustics  Terminology (International Organization for Standardization,
Geneva, 2017), available from www.iso.org/standard/62406.html
Finally, some technical remarks can be made about the table and figures:
Table 1:
- Unit of weight is Newton, unit of mass is kg
- What time zone is used for times mentioned? Is this local time? UTC?
- Notation for dates appears to be year-month-date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Units for acoustic quantities are not provided in the table (while they are provided for all other
quantities). These units are provided on Y-axes in figure 1, so are probably the same.
- No quantity/units are provided on y-axes of figure 2. From the figure caption I understand this
should be distance in km.
After correction of the items mentioned above, I would encourage publication of the paper.

Associate Editor's comments:
Both referees agree that the data presented here are important and should be published, but one
in particular has identified some significant issues that must be addressed before the paper can be
accepted. I am inclined to agree with the second referee that the evidence for long-term
displacement is equivocal at best; this must be addressed or rebutted in a revision, but it would
probably take a lot to convince me that the authors' present conclusions on this subject are not a
stretch in logic.
I request that the authors submit a revised manuscript, detailing what they have done in response
to these latest reviews (notably the more substantial review of Referee 2).

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The authors have done a good job in addressing referee comments, and I agree with the
reviewers that the manuscript is well written. Despite the small sample size, the results are
valuable, and if the minor comments below, and those of the last referee, are dealt with, the paper
should be acceptable for publication.
Line 259: delete more. The term increasingly more complex is redundant.
Lines 26, 195, 315, 320, 350: wiggliness. Im still not sure what this means, despite what seems
to be an attempt at a definition in lines 195-7. Either define it more clearly, or substitute another
word (circuitous?)
Line 374: it might be more accurate to say lasted for up to 24 hours.
Line 440: the idea that animals in poorer condition should be less likely to displace from good
foraging habitat is rather speculative despite the mass/length data in Table 1; I would change
should be expected to might be expected.
In the authors discussion, its worth briefly citing another recent paper from this journal on
response to noise, Falcone et al. 2017 (Royal Society Open Science, DOI: 10.1098/rsos.170629).

December 2017
Professor Jeremy Sanders, Editor-in-Chief of Royal Society Open Science.
ase find in association with this cover letter a revised version of our manuscript (reference
ber: RSOS-160343) entitled: Evidence of long-term displacement of individual harbour
poises exposed to short-term noise pulses from a single airgun submitted for potential
lication in your journal.
have rewritten the manuscript in accordance with the many constructive comments provided by 2
ewers. Below is a detailed list in which we explain how the comments were handled (in blue and
ting with **Response:). Most importantly and following suggestions made by the reviewers, we
e changed the title, rewritten the Introduction and Discussion to emphasise that our study
cerns movement responses of free-ranging individual porpoises exposed to short-term noise
ses emitted by a single airgun. Direct extrapolation of our results to the movement behaviour of
poises following a full scale, commercial seismic survey or pile-driving operation is therefore
arranted and we explicitly state this in the Discussion. Moreover, we better highlight the value of
study within the context of human disturbances in marine environments as the noise emitted
ing our exposure experiments (although at a smaller scale) are similar to those emitted during
h authentic seismic surveys and pile driving activities as they are all high-intensity pulses with
frequency emphasis that also contains considerable medium-to-high frequency noise. We have

ociate Editor Comments to Author:
s is not publishable in its current form. The study is potentially useful, but both referees have
tified major issues that must be dealt with in a revision, which I suspect will require substantial
orking of the manuscript.
esponse: Following the constructive comments from two anonymous reviewers, we have revised the
uscript substantially. First, we have rewritten the Introduction to highlight better that our study
cerns movement responses of free-ranging individual porpoises exposed to short-term noise pulses
tted by a single airgun. Direct extrapolation of our results to the movement behaviour of porpoises
owing a full scale, commercial seismic survey is therefore unwarranted and we explicitly state this in
Discussion. We have also introduced previous findings on the effect of underwater noise emitted
ng pile driving for offshore construction on harbour porpoises to provide a wider context for our
y and to remove any sign of competing interest by our funders. Moreover, we better emphasise the
e of our study within this context as the noise emitted during our exposures are similar to those
tted during both authentic seismic surveys and pile driving activities as they are all high-intensity
es with low frequency emphasis that also contains considerable medium-to-high frequency noise (see
Lines: 325-327). Secondly, we have addressed all concerns by reviewer 2 on the acoustics of the
y by incorporating a new figure (Fig. 1) and a paragraph explaining in detail how we estimated noise
ls (now presented as Lpp, Leq-fast and SELs to facilitate comparison with previous and future studies),
ell as how the changing spectral characteristics of airgun pulses with range will affect what a harbour
poise is exposed to (audiogram-weighted SEL). Finally, all minor comments and requests for further
hodological details were incorporated (as explained below). Please note that we provide Line numbers
ll changes in our responses, which refer to the manuscript document with track-changes included.
iewers' Comments to Author:

s is a study undertaken reasonably competently (with some oversights that can be rectified at this
e), and the co-authors are respectable and knowledgeable scientists (I am not familiar with the lead
or yet). It has also been undertaken for the right reasons. Taken for what it is (and with some
ifications to my queries, which simply apply common sense biologically), it is a valid and publishable
y, and I am thus recommending that it be published. What it is not (and is leaning currently towards
g) is a study that should extrapolate behaviour of animals to anticipated reaction to a full scale,
mercial seismic survey, and therefore it is of limited usefulness in getting any closer to answering the
ning question we need to address: are full seismic surveys detrimental to porpoises? For this reason,
title is misleading, and really should be changed from its current status. I outline my reasoning below:
esponse: We fully agree with this comment (and others related to this issue below). Direct
apolation of our results to the movement behaviour of porpoises following a full scale, commercial
mic survey is unwarranted. To avoid any misunderstanding on this important issue, we have rewritten
title (as suggested) and various parts of the introduction and discussion to highlight this better.
hough our results provide important insight into the behavioural mechanisms that could also operate
ng authentic seismic surveys or pile driving activities, we explicitly state that our small-scale results
not be extrapolated directly to authentic offshore activities (Lines: 349-350).
e & Introduction: I have made a few minor grammatical suggestions to the English, having learned a
rom a proofing editor for a book, and they improve the 'flow' of writing immeasurably.
esponse: We appreciate the grammatical suggestions made on the pdf and we have incorporated these
he revised manuscript.
ialities aside, firstly, there is no description on what a commercial seismic survey is. Have the authors
n on an actual seismic survey or worked in the industry before? Readers need to know how a full-scale
mic survey is undertaken to place this small-scale experimental study into context, in order that the
-expert can understand why the experiment is nothing like a commercial survey (nor is it supposed to
and nor should it be extrapolated to be for various reasons explained later). So the title really ought to
hanged to reflect what it is: Evidence of long-term displacement of individual harbour porpoises
osed to short-term single seismic airgun noise.
esponse: As mentioned above we have changed the title to better reflect the work that was done:
idence of long-term displacement of individual harbour porpoises exposed to short-term noise pulses
m a single airgun
mic surveys move in pre-determined transect lines, have large and noisy source vessels, with noisy
king guard vessels (depending on survey 2-5 vessels, sometimes more), coupled with long (e.g. 14
streamers, and full airgun source arrays, firing sometimes in a 'flip-flop' formation, with frequent
ods of operational downtime, interspersed with test firing. Depending on type of survey (Ocean
tom Cable, 2D, 3D, Vertical Seismic Profile, VSP etc.), they can be preceded by a lot of noisy activity
he region (vessels, positioning equipment, ROVs etc.) prior to (weeks to months, and in some cases
rs) the actual survey. Moreover, in terms of typical, ship-based seismic surveys in the North sea, there
n obligatory preceding ramp-up procedure (albeit the effectiveness of which is being disputed
ently - see latest AN2016 abstracts and posters). Seismic surveys are heard by animals over long
ances, thus presumably giving warning to animals that the survey is commencing somewhere in their
nity, even if noise directionality is difficult to ascertain underwater.
esponse: Because we have rewritten the manuscript to focus on movement responses following a
rt-term exposure experiment and we explicitly state that our results should not be extrapolated directly
orpoise behaviour in general, we have decided not to include much detail about the operational
cedure of authentic seismic surveys or pile-driving activities for offshore construction. We do,
ever, refer the reader to other studies that describe these in detail (Lines: 337-338).
intro, as is stands currently, implies that the authors have undertaken their research with a
conceived view that seismic surveys are detrimental to all marine mammal species. I'm not disputing
, as this may well be the case as more studies emerge, but there are some competent studies,
ertaken by unbiased academics on government funding that show little or no effect, and these must
be listed in the introduction to present a balanced view (I have added some comments to this effect,
the authors will know these studies). I note, with surprise, that this is windfarm funding, and while I
not questioning the validity of the study, windfarm companies inevitably want to see a detrimental
come. This especially holds true in Germany, where the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) have
duced legally binding regulations based on data provided by Lucke et al. (2009) of a dual noise
erion of 160 dB re 1 µPa²s Sound Exposure Level (SEL) and 190 dB re 1 µPa² (peak to peak Sound
ssure Level, SPL) that can not be exceeded at a distance of 750 m from the source (described by de
g et al. (2011)). Effectively, there is a LOT of politics in Europe on this, and the authors really need to
ure that they themselves have made every endeavour to give an unbiased argument. Commence
iased, set the scene, and move on.
esponse: We never intended to raise the suggestion that seismic surveys are detrimental to all marine
mmal species. We sincerely hope that the revised article does not imply any bias or preconceived view
our part or competing interests by our funding partners (as in any good scientific research project). In
revised abstract and introduction we explicitly state that our study concerns movement responses of
-ranging individual porpoises exposed to (short-term) impulsive airgun noise. In the revised
oduction, we set the scene by describing the topic of underwater noise in general. We then continue by
enting (unbiased) information on how evidence on noise-induced movement responses of individuals
mited to large cetacean species and the general importance of such data. To our knowledge, there is
rwhelming evidence that large cetacean species respond to impulsive underwater noise with altered
vements. We then report on what is known for porpoises specifically. Again, the empirical evidence
we are aware of does suggest that porpoises respond to impulsive underwater noise sources as
erved through temporary changes in local density and echolocation activity following both seismic
eys and pile driving during offshore wind farm construction. How high-intensity underwater noise
es alter the natural behaviour of porpoises is, however, constrained because data on noise-induced
rations in fine-scale movements of individuals are currently lacking. This is where our study
tributes to the current knowledge base. To what degree such movement alterations influence fitness of
viduals and subsequently population dynamics is an important point of discussion in our article and an
ortant recommendation for future research. From our results, however, we cannot imply that seismic
eys or pile driving noise are detrimental to all marine mammal species and we have removed all text
may have raised this suspicion.
thermore, our funding partners (wind farm companies) did not have any influence on this study. But,
emove any sign of competing interests we have now explicitly incorporated previous findings of
poise behaviour following pile-driving activities alongside the seismic surveys examples, also to
vide a wider context for the necessity of our study. We agree with the reviewer that there is a great
l of politics surrounding the issue of underwater noise and harbour porpoises but a discussion on this
e is beyond the scope of our study. This because we report on empirical findings following a short-
exposure experiment only, which does not (and should not) have direct influence on (intern)national
ulations of underwater noise levels.
ny study, it is important to dial out and see the bigger picture, as it influences methodological design.
ether we like it or not, harbour porpoises have been living with seismic surveys for generations (good
ad for them, probably latter, time will tell). In an evolutionary sense, this means that porpoises
ecially in the North Sea) experience seismic surveys on a regular basis, generationally. Indeed, given
cal porpoise life expectancy in the wild, the majority of the North Sea population has probably never
erienced anything other than these types of surveys (think: hey mummy, what's that awful sound? It's
ismic survey honey, it's going to get noisy etc.). So, applying natural selection, it is highly probable
populations of porpoises should have learned to recognise the noise signatures of typical seismic
eys, and 'expect' what's coming their way. This is super important when deriving inferences from
e sorts of short-term, attenuated source, experimental studies.
esponse: We agree that most porpoise populations do experience various anthropogenic (acoustic)
urbances and may have learned to recognise signs that warns them of an upcoming disturbance event.
ause our experiments did not have typical warning sign of potential noise disturbance events such as
ng authentic seismic surveys and pile driving events, the porpoises could have responded to a sudden
unexpected noise. We now state this explicitly in the discussion (Lines: 330-341).
hods. How was the airgun deployed? On commercial surveys, animals are warned with a ramp up.
tly, while we have known this for years in bats, Paul Nachtigall's recent work on acoustic dampening
chtigall, P. E. & Supin, A. Y. Conditioned hearing sensitivity reduction in a bottlenose dolphin
rsiops truncatus). J. Exp. Biol. 217, 2806-2813, doi:10.1242/jeb.104091 (2014)) has shown that
mals, with prior warning of a noise source, can physically reduce their hearing by up to 15 dB, which
last up to 3 days. In this study, porpoises within the 500 m vicinity of the single airgun exposure
ive no prior warning that they will be exposed to a sound source they have never heard before (a
le gun) in a region that has never had this kind of 'single airgun' noise before, and from a small vessel
doesn't typically exhibit a noise signature that includes an airgun, and thus they are not expecting that
d of vessel to produce that kind of noise (it doesn't actually say in the methods that the source was
loyed from a vessel, and should, unless I'm missing something). So firstly, we have to assume that the
pening effect could have been applied here should the animals have been forewarned. Animals thus
y got a chance to apply this method of minimising self exposure (if possible) on the second presented
e. Moreover, the animals had no idea that a seismic exposure would occur in the region (none of the
ustic 'signature' of a full scale seismic survey have been presented, since there are no surveys going on
he region - we have to assume that the authors have controlled for this, and if not, why not - state it
ewhere, it's important), so any perceived reactions to the gun could be for any reason other than what
authors want to prove (that seismic surveys are detrimental to porpoises). This especially holds true,
e we now know cetaceans react to types of noise, not necessarily because they are likely to hurt them,
because they are startled by being presented noises out of context, or simply sounds that are alien (e.g.
amas Range work). Suddenly playing an alien sound (because one gun does not sound anything like a
commercial array) to an animal in their normal home-range field conditions with no prior history of
type of sound in their soundscape, from a vessel that's not supposed to 'sound' like that, with no prior
ning is bound to elicit a reaction. And, of course, we must not exclude the presence of the vessel itself
nty of published research on the effects of vessels on porpoises), so the airgun exposure conditions
t be described in more detail. Apropos vessel, if the same vessel was used to undertake the noise
y, and catch and tag the animals, then not only has the same vessel been used to play the sound
ore, but it could have been associated with some very unpleasant experiences for animals in the region.
h porpoises, never underestimate vessels. We are not doing experiments on sea anemones here,
poises are intelligent, acoustic animals par excellence, and most importantly, have a memory. The
ors have become so wrapped up in the modelling, they appear to have forgotten about some very
c biology of porpoises.
esponse: The reviewer raises several important methodological issues. We addressed these by adding
e information to the method section and particularly to the paragraph describing the exposure
eriments (Lines: 105-155). Specifically, more detail is provided on how the airgun was deployed and
exposure conditions, and we note that captured porpoises were tagged on fishing boats and a different
sel was used during the exposures. This to ensure that the porpoises did not associate the vessel used
ng the exposures with any previous disturbance (tagging). To what degree the nature of the noise
rce a sudden sound out of context without warning may have had on the behaviour of the porpoise
viduals is now also discussed in more detail (Lines: 330-341).
poises caught were different sexes, so while the authors address body mass, they don't address the
ential of sex-based reactions, perhaps as a consequence of reproductive status (pregnant/lactating
ales), and probably should. Also, within females, there are genetic differences between northern and
thern North Sea animals. This sex-related difference in population genetic structure suggests that
es disperse more than females, which show fidelity to certain areas - philopatry (Teilmann has done
k on this himself, so knows the references Rosel et al 1999, Eisfeld and Kock 2006 , etc.). Again,
ain individuals may have strong drives to remain in certain areas for reproductive reasons, and thus
it higher tolerances, which again is probably worth mentioning and expanding upon.
esponse: Although we agree that acoustic tolerance/ behavioural responses may be sex-dependent our
ted sample size precludes a detailed and robust evaluation of this notion, especially as we found
trasting evidence with both a male and female responding most pronounced to the exposure
eriment. But because these 2 individuals scored lowest on the mass/length index, we have retained the
f discussion of a potential physical condition-dependent effect. Nonetheless, we have noted sex and
-dependent responses as an important topic for future research (Lines: 374-376).
ally, probably ought to be mentioned, but while no audiograms were taken on these individuals in the
d (and really could have been, there are 'kits' available from Dorian Hauser, and it can be done fairly
ckly, although I appreciate the procedure is traumatic enough for the individuals), there exists the
sibility that some of them were 'deafer' than the others, and therefore more 'tolerant'. This ought to be
ussed as a caveat to the study.
esponse: This is a valid point. We agree that audiograms could have been made for these individuals,
we instead decided to keep disturbance during porpoise handling to a minimum, which is now
licitly stated in the Methods (Lines: 88-93). We also point out that we have added a reference to a
y that tested the hearing of wild porpoises in the same study area as ours (Lines: 93), which showed
hearing capacity of porpoise individuals in this region is normal. Moreover, we state that we only
ed individuals that were in good physical condition (Lines: 92) and that we assumed that the hearing
agged individuals was also good.

mments to the Author(s)
s paper is on the behavioural response of 5 porpoises responding to acoustic signals of a seismic
un. These observations from the natural habitat of porpoises and with an actual airgun (transmitting
er briefly for just one minute, instead of days or weeks) is important information to the community of
erstanding this process and needed to assess the environmental impact for managers and regulators.
us of the study is mostly on the biology and the behaviour of the porpoises, while from my
pective not enough attention is paid to the acoustic component of the study. I didnt see a clear
ussion on the frequency content of the signal and the consequences of that, and also the quantities and
s are not clear or incorrect. The way of estimating the received (sound pressure?) level is debatable.
s looks like a missed opportunity, because now we see porpoises responding (which is hard to
ieve) but we dont know exactly to what they are responding to. The introduction of the paper can be
roved, and also the main research question or main aim of the study could be better motivated. For
agers and regulators, moving from population responses to individual responses seems a step back
er than moving forward. What exactly is the detailed individual response adding here? I would
gest this should be addressed, and I think the acoustic component of the study needs more attention.
ybe some additional modelling could provide better estimates of the actual exposure, and including the
uency distribution of the signal in combination with weighting functions (e.g. the new NOAA
nitions for this) could potentially remove a considerable amount of uncertainty in the study.
esponse: Regarding the first point of the reviewer; we have rewritten the introduction to better
hlight the need and value of our study. First, we introduce the knowledge gap that currently exists
cerning the behavioural response of smaller cetacean individuals to underwater noise. Filling this gap
mportant to quantify the behavioural mechanism responsible for the previously observed local density
cts. Second, quantifying the behavioural responses by individuals is a crucial step towards being able
redict population-level consequences as shown by New et al (2014) as also referenced by the reviewer
w. This process is especially pertinent for harbour porpoises, which have a high metabolic demand,
alterations in behaviour of individuals due to anthropogenic noise are expected to have fitness costs
e explain in detail in the Introduction (Lines: 62-69).
arding the second point of the reviewer (improving the acoustic component); we now provide
itional information (Lines: 127-155) and made a new figure (Fig. 1) to better show how we estimated
e levels for each individual, including also audiogram-weighted SEL based on data collected in
vious studies. More details on this in our next response
e more specific remarks are provided below, referring to the line numbers of the document including
e text with track changes.

ve no clue what this 195 dB re 1 uPa is supposed to express. Is it an attempt to represent Source
el? That is a common (and well defined) term for sonar sources, but than the units are different (dB re
Pa m), also expressing the source has been calculated back to a point source and the sound pressure
l expressed at 1m distance from that point source. Using Source Level however is not recommended
impulsive sound sources. Mostly sound exposure levels (SEL) or peak-to-peak sound pressure levels
L) are used. This is done in several other studies, both in the field (e.g. Thompson et al.2013, your
11) or with captive animals (e.g. recent paper by Reichmuth et al.2016 JASA, 140, 2646). Because of
change in frequency distribution at different ranges (and different environments), the source level
ht also not be that relevant. In this case an indication of the strength of the airgun, normally expressed
volume (typically in cubic inches) and operating pressure would be sufficient.
esponse: We agree that source levels may not represent the actual noise level at 1 meter from the
rce, but back-calculated source levels together with transmission loss models based on recorded data
still be useful to estimate noise levels at other ranges, which is the method that we use to obtain noise
ls for our exposure distances. To improve the section on acoustics of the study (Lines: 127-155), we
e added a figure (Fig. 1) showing how we estimate noise levels based on recorded noise data of a 10
airgun in a similar study area as ours. This figure also includes peak-peak pressures and SELs to
ommodate the comments given here and below to facilitate comparison of our results to other/future
ies that calculate/measure only one of these units. Additionally, we have included audiogram-
ghted SELs (using a harbour porpoise audiogram from Kastelein et al. 2002, 2010) to show that the
h pass filter effect of shallow water will affect what a porpoise is exposed to (Lines: 151-155).
reover, we have better highlighted the volume of the airgun and operating pressure used during the
osure experiments, also in the Abstract (Lines: 24-25).
e 27:
nd level is not defined, I am presuming sound pressure level is meant here.
thermore, for the numbers, I am not convinced these levels are correctly estimated (see below), and
at this stage mostly a guess. If the acoustics is better treated the accuracy could be improved and
entially some uncertainty can be reduced here.
esponse: This sentence has been removed from the abstract. Since we did not record airgun pulses in
study, we do unfortunately not have sufficient data to perform more detailed analysis of the acoustics.
wever, we have improved how the noise levels are presented by adding a detailed figure (Fig 1, see
vious comment), which gives a good indication about what noise levels our study animals were
osed to, as they were based on previously recorded data of the same size airgun at the approx. same
sure (ca. 125 bar) and in a comparable shallow water habitat. We now explicitly state that noise levels
he airgun were not recorded in this study and that we relied on other studies to estimate noise levels
es: 127-128).
e 32:
nt understand what both is referring to here. In the above 2+1 animals are mentioned.
esponse: We have rewritten this sentence in the abstract to avoid any misunderstanding (Line: 32).
es 41-42:
m this list I would say that underwater explosions (or clearance of UXO) are missing. I didnt check if
is also not mentioned in refs[1/2/3/4]. A recent report on impact of explosions is provided in Von
da-Beckmann et al.(2015) Aq.Mammals, 41(4), 503. For the North Sea an overview and ranking of
nd sources is provided in Ainslie et al.(2009) TNO-report TNO-DV 2009 C085.
esponse: We have included underwater explosions and the Von Benda-Beckmann (2015) reference to
(non-exhaustive) list of examples of high intensity underwater noise (Lines: 49-51).
e 46:
gely restricted to .. sonar... By now there is also quite some literature on the effects of pile driving
nds, especially for the effects on porpoises. For porpoises I think there are more papers on the effects
ile driving than on the effects of (military) sonar.
esponse: This sentence has been rewritten. Indeed, much is known about the response of porpoises to
-driving noise, and this is now explicitly stated in the manuscript (Lines: 65-69).
e 47:
sure these references are just examples. If it should list all the species studied to date, several
rences can be added, e.g. Miller et al.(2012), Isojunno et al.(2016), Sivle et al. (2015). These
rences would include the following species: killer whales, pilot whales, sperm whales, humpback
les and minke whales.
esponse: It is not our intention to provide a full overview of all studies on this topic (as it would in a
ew paper), but we have added 2 of the 3 references provided by the reviewer to introduce the
ilable evidence of noise-induced responses of large cetaceans.
e 50:
Source sound level the same as source level? The latter is much better defined. For the first, I dont
w what it means or what definition can be referred to.
esponse: The term source sound level has been removed and back-calculated source levels (SL) are
defined in the methods section (Lines: 131-132)
e 57:
most excusively : is ref.[13] the only exception where I think I recall that tagged sperm whale data is
orted?
esponse: This sentence was removed completely following the rewrite of the Introduction.
e 103:
here any reference of these field recordings of the propagation..? This sounds very relevant to
port the estimation method used below.
esponse: This paragraph (Lines: 127-155) has been rewritten and extended to better highlight how we
mated noise levels. Indeed, here we referred to the field-study of Hermannsen et al. (2015).
es 104-105:
e reference is made to Source Level (SL), but not with usual definition, and incorrect unit. This would
mally be dB re 1 uPa m (sometimes also dB re 1 uPa @1m).
esponse: We agree that @ 1 m was missing from this unit, which is now corrected (Lines: 132-
).
es 109-110:
pagation loss is assumed to follow 17 log(range). Reference is made to [21], but this doesnt explain
choice of 17, where in [21] a range of 16-19 is mentioned, and 18 is mentioned in the abstract. Note
in Thompson et al. (ref.11), they found values between 21 and 24. Also in this part of the text no
rence is made to the frequency distribution of the signal, while this is a substantial component of the
lysis in ref.[21], including the high-pass filtering effect of the shallow water environment, and the
uency weighting of the signal. In particular, given that high frequency components can differ a lot for
erent type of airguns, it would be interested to look at the frequency weighted SEL values, e.g. using
recent NOAA weighting function or audiogram.
esponse: The 17log10(range) model is for a 10 in3 airgun (as the one used here) from figure 3 (marker
d asterix) in Hermannsen et al. 2015. To make this clearer, we have added these transmission loss
dels in our new figure (Fig. 1) showing recorded airgun noise levels from the previous study together
h estimates of noise levels for the porpoises in this study. We have added a section on shallow water
ng as a high pass filter and included audiogram-weighted SELs (see previous comment and the new
ure 1) to further show how the changing spectral characteristics of airgun pulses with range will affect
noise that a porpoise is exposed to (Lines: 149-155).
e 116:
at is received sound level? Is this received sound pressure level?
esponse: We have changed the term received sound level to noise level, which now besides received
S levels in a 125 ms window (Leq-fast), also includes peak-peak levels and SELs.
e 133:
my knowledge the SI unit for seconds is s (not sec). For meters we use m (not mtr).
esponse: This has been corrected as we now follow SI units throughout.
es 189-190:
important remark to make here, is that there is no (tag) data available before the tagging
mpt/activity, only data is recorded (obviously) after the tag is placed. This is different for the seismic
onse, where (tag) data before the exposure is available. Note that the distance quantity as a range
) is a bit of a weird one: it can never decrease after the release if you start the release of the animals at
, the animal will always swim somewhere, which is automatically defined as an avoidance away from
release position. But maybe I am missing the point here.
esponse: The reviewer is not missing the point and correct that movements following release will
ays be away from the capture/tagging location and as such lead to displacement (Fig. 2). This is a
cal result and as such not analysed using a statistical procedure but simply displayed in a figure. This
ow explicitly stated in the methods (Lines: 170). In contrast, the parameters that are analysed in the
M and piecewise regression analyses (Figs 3& 4) are the actual dives or steps made that can
entially but not necessarily) lead to a displacement effect. Both pieces of information (Fig 2 and Figs
4) determine if an individual showed any responses to the tagging/handling and the exposure event.
e that maybe the recent paper by Visser et al.(2016) Scientific reports 6, 28641, could be relevant
e, where the effect of tagging could be compared with different stimuli, using a protocol to have
ual) data available also before the tagging activity. But here the tagging (of pilot whales) is different
without capturing the animals.
esponse: We appreciate the reference provided and we have included it in the methods to highlight
importance of quantifying differences in behavioural response following different types of
urbances (Lines: 230-232). However, we do not discuss any differences or similarities in results
ween this study and that of Visser et al as the methods and species used were different, which would
ract from the main results and discussion on underwater noise effects on harbour porpoise movements.
e 273:
I miss the analysis of fine-scale behaviour? I would say there is not that much attention to fine scale
ects, only the statistical characteristics of it. But maybe I am not appreciating the statistical analysis
l enough here.
esponse: We have rewritten this sentence and removed the term fine-scale behaviour (Lines:
XX).
e 276:
sure what is meant with this behavioural gradient here
esponse: The behavioural gradient refers to the individual variation in noise-induced movement
onses that we observed. We have rewritten this sentence to make it clearer (Lines: 217).
e 286:

esponse: This sentence was removed completely following the rewrite of the Discussion.

esponse: We appreciate that.
e 324:

esponse: This sentence was removed completely following the rewrite of the Discussion.
e 371:
sure why some obvious references are missing. I would say the Southall et al.(2007) paper is relevant,
s the Lucke et al.(2009) paper with TTS in porpoises by airgun sound. Also any references to
AD/PCOD Population consequences of (acoustic) disturbance) is missing; work by Costa, Harwood,
w, etc. The latter seems relevant to last para of discussion (lines 333-341).
esponse: We have incorporated these references into the revised manuscript where appropriate. Note
the PCAD/PCOD model is cited but we refer to the individual-based model of Nabe-Nielsen et al
14) when discussing potential population-level consequences of underwater noise for harbour
poises as this model was built explicitly for this species and purpose, while the PCOD model is more
eral and does not incorporate fine-scale movements directly, which is the main focus of this
uscript.
Appendix B
First of all I would like to clarify that I was not involved in the first
round of the review process, but I was requested to provide an opinion on the
manuscript and reviewers comments (since one of the reviewers was unable to do
so).
Overall I find it an interesting and relevant study, since few studies have
studied the behavioural response to anthropogenic sound in such detail for
marine mammals in the wild. The manuscript is well written. Most (but not all)
comments by the reviewers seem to be addressed appropriately. The data set
they collected is very unique and valuable.
At first, the intention was to focus on the reviewers comments. However, while
reading the manuscript, I concluded that some analysis are inappropriate and
the concerns are directly relevant for the main conclusion of the paper.
To summarize, in my view there is insufficient evidence for long-term
avoidance. See explanation below.
Also reviewer 1 touches briefly on one issue:
***
Reviewer 1: An important remark to make here, is that there is no (tag) data
available before the tagging attempt/activity, only data is recorded (obviously)
after the tag is placed. This is different for the seismic response, where (tag)
data before the exposure is available. Note that the distance quantity as a range
(r>0) is a bit of a weird one: it can never decrease after the release if you
start the release of the animals at r=0, the animal will always swim somewhere,
which is automatically defined as an avoidance away from the release position. But
maybe I am missing the point here.
Author Response: The reviewer is not missing the point and correct that movements
following release will always be away from the capture/tagging location and as
such lead to displacement (Fig. 2). This is a logical result and as such not
analysed using a statistical procedure but simply displayed in a figure. This
is now explicitly stated in the methods (Lines: 170). In contrast, the parameters
that are analysed in the GAM and piecewise regression analyses (Figs 3& 4) are the
actual dives or steps made that can (potentially but not necessarily) lead to a
displacement effect. Both pieces of information (Fig 2 and Figs 3&4) determine if
an individual showed any responses to the tagging/handling and the exposure event.
***
This issue not only applies to the capture/exposure, but also to the sound
exposure. Imagine an animal is moving from A to B, and at any point in-between
one would record the distance to the observer, it would lead to a decline and
subsequent increase in distance, irrespective of whether the animal shows any
signs of avoidance.
Also the distance of porpoise ID1 to the exposure (Fig. 2, top panel) seem to
highlight the risk of misinterpreting the figure/analysis. Porpoise ID1, which
remained within ~25 km prior to exposure (and also post-capture), leaves the
area afterwards. However, the first 4-5 hours after exposure it almost doesnt
increase its distance away from the exposure site (Fig. 2). Combined with very
little evidence for an increase in residual speed following exposure (Fig.
3,4), it is very likely that the movement away is the result of a more
natural movement process. Porpoises can be very mobile, as is evident for
e.g. ID4 who steadily moves >120 km after capture (and before exposure).
Now although it is stated in the manuscript and response to the comments by
the reviewers that the displacement is not directly used in the statistical
testing, it does form the basis of the main conclusion: Evidence of long-term
displacement....
As stated by the authors, not this actual displacement, but parameters related
to movement and diving were used. However, looking at those parameters, no
long-term (>2.5 days) changes in behaviour are evident. For example, for
porpoise ID3 the 3rd breakpoint (reflecting the recovery) was very close to the
2nd breakpoint (reflecting the exposure). So this does suggest rapid recovery.
Also, irrespective of the analysis result, the parameters related to diving
and movement do not show long-term (>2.5 days) effects. Maybe 10 hours max.
Furthermore, in my view the philosophy behind the statistical analysis is not
correct.
The methods state: If the 95% CI of the second breakpoint overlapped with the
time of airgun exposure we took this as evidence that the behavioural change
was influenced by the noise exposure.
This implies that if there is little information on the location of the second
breakpoint (i.e. airgun exposure), the CIs will be large, and there is a
higher probability of overlap. This is not a desirable statistical property,
and will lead to a conclusion of evidence, when in fact there is little
information in data on where the break should be located.
For example Lines 291-292 read:
Porpoise ID 1 showed a partial response to airgun noise with an increase in
speed between relocations for up to 21 hrs post-exposure (Fig 3, ESM, Table
S1) and directed movements (i.e., negative turning angle residuals; Fig. 3)
post- exposure.
This is mostly explained by large CIs, which are (by definition) more likely
to overlap with the actual exposure event.
****************************************************************************
So in summary: In my view the analysis is currently insufficient to claim
evidence for long-term (>2.5 days) displacement. For porpoise ID3 the data
seem to suggest a behavioural response, but this is only apparent for a few
hours. And yes, it could be a trigger for the animal to leave the area, but
given the low sample size (4-5 porpoises), high mobility of the species and
short tracking/base-line period, this is in my view insufficient scientific
evidence to claim a long-term displacement caused by the airgun. The animal
might have travelled to another area, irrespective of the exposure.
****************************************************************************
Irrespective of the analysis, but simply looking at the data, Im not convinced
the existing data provides evidence for long-term avoidance. However in an
attempt to be constructive, some suggestions for improving the analysis:
- Both ID3 and ID5 appear to show a change in behaviour in response to the
exposure lasting for several hours. It is already interesting that a 1
minute exposure leads to such a long effect (not days, but probably
hours). You could dive in more depth here, e.g. by estimating the change
and recovery period.
- The data on post-capture behaviour is very interesting. All animals seem
to respond heavily and in some cases this appears to last for several
hours. E.g. the residual speed seems close to 5 m/s. Assuming a mean
speed of 1 m/s, actual speed is even higher? That is really fast. This
can be a solid basis for future behavioural response studies.
- The data is now summarized into hourly blocks. Might be good to show the
immediate response, and illustrate how a behavioural change is prolonged
over longer time-periods
- Instead of using piece-wise regression, where the lines are connected, a
variable intercept-model would seem more logical for capturing abrupt
changes in behaviour. E.g. for the ID5 some abrupt changes in behaviour
are apparent (e.g. post-dive duration), but this does not seem to be
appropriately captured by the piece-wise regression (Fig 4)
- In my view a more robust analysis would be: create fake exposure events
and measure the behavioural change before and after the fake event.
Repeat this to create a random distribution of the test statistics.
Subsequently do this for the real exposure and test whether the
behavioural change is in the tail of this distribution.
Some other comments
Line 150-155: In shallow water, airgun pulses are subject to a high pass
filtering effect, causing the sound energy at higher frequencies above 1 kHz
relative to total broadband energy to increase with increasing range [35,37].
To account for this, SELs were frequency weighted with a harbour porpoise
audiogram [38,39] using the method from Hermannsen et al. [35], which gave an
approximation of porpoises having experienced weighted SELs of 112-116 dB re 1
µPa2 s (audiogram-weighted) resulting from the airgun exposures (Fig. 1).
There appear to be two issues mentioned here: 1) There is frequency dependent
attenuation, which implies that the relative frequency spectrum near the
source is different from larger distances. 2) Not all frequencies are equally
audible to the porpoise, and hence a porpoise weighted audiogram is employed.
The text currently suggest that a solution for 2 is used to combat problem 1
(i.e. to account for this)? Please clarify.
Line 205: We extracted the residuals of each GAM model ...
Which residuals were extracted? Raw, Pearson, standardized, and conditional or
marginal?
Line 229-230: This allowed us to formally compare the behavioural response
effect of two types of anthropogenic disturbances (capture/tagging and
exposure to airgun noise)..
So prior to the airgun exposure it is possible to define a baseline and
capture a sudden change in behaviour. However, for the capture/tagging it is
only possible to measure a recovery period which is probably more smooth.
Line 252: The validity of a breakpoint was determined by the gap coefficient
and corresponding t-value.
Please clarify gap coefficient.
General point discussion:
A large part of the discussion focusses on whether the experimental sound
exposure is representative for more real seismic surveys (and pile driving),
which is proposed by one reviewer. But in my view one needs to take a step
back: does the experimental exposure really lead to considerable long-term
behavioural changes, what are these changes and what is the implication?
The long-term avoidance is presented as a fact, and the discussion is to a
large extend devoted to explaining why individual long-term displacement is
relevant. I would like to see a more in-depth discussion on whether the main
conclusion is indeed correct.
Appendix C
Associate Editor's comments:
Both referees agree that the data presented here are important and should be published, but
one in particular has identified some significant issues that must be addressed before the
paper can be accepted. I am inclined to agree with the second referee that the evidence for
long-term displacement is equivocal at best; this must be addressed or rebutted in a revision,
but it would probably take a lot to convince me that the authors' present conclusions on this
subject are not a stretch in logic. I request that the authors submit a revised manuscript,
detailing what they have done in response to these latest reviews (notably the more substantial
review of Referee 3).
**Response: We agree with the AE and reviewer 3 that our previous conclusion of long-term
displacement by harbour porpoises following our short term exposure experiment was not
fully supported by the data as only 1 individual (out of 5) displayed such movement patterns.
We have therefore rewritten all text where this was given as a general finding/fact. In
addition, we have also changed the title of our manuscript to better reflect the focus of this
study, which concerns potential short-term, fine-scale movement responses to the airgun
exposure as well as those following capture and tagging activities, as also suggested by
reviewer 3 below.
Furthermore and following the extremely valuable comments by reviewer 3, we have
reanalysed the data using a more objective data-driven analytical procedure, which allowed us
to better detect and quantify the abrupt response and subsequent recovery period of the two
anthropogenic disturbances studied here. Although the main results of the reanalyses
remained similar when compared to our previous manuscript, we were able to develop models
that fitted the movement data better enabling us to extract more details about the length of the
behavioural responses and subsequent recovery period, which are also discussed more
extensively in the text. All figures and tables have been updated based on our reanalyses and
all minor comments by both reviewers were also incorporated, enabling us to resubmit a
markedly improved manuscript.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
The authors have improved the manuscript substantially. Most of the comments have been
incorporated in the updated version. I have to admit that I still regret the quantification of the
acoustics has been ignored to such a large extent, which I think is a missed opportunity for
this study. Very valuable and unique behavioural data is collected, showing the response to a
stimulus that is not quantified in great detail and is estimated in a very crude way and in large
contrast to the fine scale detail of the behavioural data.
**Response: We certainly agree with the reviewer that our estimates of received noise levels
by the exposed porpoises are somewhat crude, as this was not measured explicitly in the
current study. This remains the case despite our efforts to calculate noise levels as best we
could based on previously published sound models based on the same study area, using the
same equipment (Fig. 1). As such, we have added text to the discussion (Lines: 424-428)
where we 1) discuss how lack of recordings of the acoustics influences the interpretation of
our results and 2) recommend future noise exposure studies to measure not only the
behavioural response but also the received noise levels in more detail, as tags that can do so
are now available.
The authors have done effort to demonstrate the validity of the estimation of the acoustic
stimulus. It is much clearer now where the number come from, as it is included in the paper
itself (fig.1). Nevertheless it is still a very crude way of estimating these numbers. It is
debatable how similar the actual environment is to the reference environment of Hermannsen
et al.(2015) to the area of the 5 released porpoises. In Hermannsen et al this was stated about
this environment: Recordings of airgun noise were obtained at sea state 0 in Aarhus Bay
(along a line from 56° 07.45N, 10°18.24E to 56°06.74N, 10°19.11E) over a sandy bottom
with a uniform water depth of 15 m (± 0.2 m). For the actual areas only the water depth
(named bathymetry in table 1) is provided. Most water depths are much deeper than the
reference region, and no mentioning is made about the uniformity, bottom/sediment type or
sea state, which will all affect the propagation of the sound to some extent.
**Response: We agree with the reviewer that bathymetry; seabed uniformity, substrate, and
sea state all influence transmission loss. We have therefore added more detail about these
conditions to Table 1. These additions highlight that there was much similarity in the
environmental conditions of the exposure sites in our study compared to those of Hermannsen
et al, but indeed some differences in bathymetry. Again, this may have caused a deviation
between our estimates and the actual received noise levels but we believe that it is better to
use previous measurements of the actual sound source (sensu Hermannsen et al), than a
theoretical model for calculating transmission loss (e.g. spherical spreading; 20*log(range)).
As far as I could see, the acoustic units that are used are not properly introduced (lines 132-
134). Some symbols are used, but it is not clear what quantities are introduced here. It appears
that the same quantities are used as in Hermannsen et al (2015), but then also these quantities
should be introduced properly at least once. Hopefully this kind of confusion can soon be
overcome with the new ISO-standard that should be published within a couple of days/weeks
from now: ISO 18405 Underwater Acoustics  Terminology (International Organization for
Standardization, Geneva, 2017), available from www.iso.org/standard/62406.html
**Response: We have updated the text and now properly introduce and explain the units at
first mention (Lines: 142-144). Here we have chosen to be consistent with the notation used
in Hermannsen et al. 2015 [35]. Both Lpp and SEL are standard ISO units. Leq-fast is a unit
proposed by Tougaard et al. (2015) as referred to by [39].
Finally, some technical remarks can be made about the table and figures:
Table 1:
- Unit of weight is Newton, unit of mass is kg
**Response: We have updated this line in Table 1 and we now state: Body mass (kg)
- What time zone is used for times mentioned? Is this local time? UTC?
**Response: Local time was used in Table 1, which is now stated explicitly in the caption.
- Notation for dates appears to be year-month-date (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Response: Correct, we now state this date notation explicitly in the caption of Table 1.
- Units for acoustic quantities are not provided in the table (while they are provided for
all other quantities). These units are provided on Y-axes in figure 1, so are probably the same.
**Response: We now provide the units for the acoustic quantities also in Table 1.
- No quantity/units are provided on y-axes of figure 2. From the figure caption I
understand this should be distance in km.
**Response: The reviewer is correct  the unit for distance is km as is indicated on the y-axis
legend of Fig. 2
After correction of the items mentioned above, I would encourage publication of the paper.
Reviewer: 3
First of all I would like to clarify that I was not involved in the first round of the review
process, but I was requested to provide an opinion on the manuscript and reviewers
comments (since one of the reviewers was unable to do so). Overall I find it an interesting and
relevant study, since few studies have studied the behavioural response to anthropogenic
sound in such detail for marine mammals in the wild. The manuscript is well written. Most
(but not all) comments by the reviewers seem to be addressed appropriately. The data set they
collected is very unique and valuable.
At first, the intention was to focus on the reviewers comments. However, while reading the
manuscript, I concluded that some analyses are inappropriate and the concerns are directly
relevant for the main conclusion of the paper. To summarize, in my view there is insufficient
evidence for long-term avoidance. See explanation below.
**Response: We appreciate the detailed and valuable feedback by this reviewer on our
manuscript. After carefully reviewing the comments and the outcome of our previous
analyses we do agree with the reviewer that based on our results there is insufficient evidence
to conclude that short-term noise exposure to a single airgun leads to long-term site
displacement in harbour porpoises. Although we observed noise-induced displacement from
the exposure site for one porpoise in our study, this was unclear or not the case for the
remaining 4 individuals. As such and given the low sample size, high mobility of the species
and short tracking/base-line period, this is insufficient scientific evidence to make such a
general biological claim. We have carefully revised the manuscript and removed all text
where this was given as a fact (note also that we changed the title of our manuscript and
removed the term long-term displacement). Moreover and following feedback of this
reviewer, we have reanalysed the data to allow for additional breakpoints (i.e. sudden changes
in behaviour) and better assess the behavioural response & recovery period of the noise
exposure event (if one was detected). As such, we have updated the methods and results
section and parts of the discussion to put more focus on the results related to the short term
behavioural responses following both types of anthropogenic disturbances used in our study
(capture/handling/tagging activities and the noise exposure experiment), as also suggested by
the reviewer below. More specific responses on how the reviewer comments were handled are
provided below.
Also reviewer 1 touches briefly on one issue:
Reviewer 1: An important remark to make here is that there is no (tag) data available before
the tagging attempt/activity, only data is recorded (obviously) after the tag is placed. This is
different for the seismic response, where (tag) data before the exposure is available. Note that
the distance quantity as a range (r>0) is a bit of a weird one: it can never decrease after the
release if you start the release of the animals at r=0, the animal will always swim somewhere,
which is automatically defined as an avoidance away from the release position. But maybe I
am missing the point here. Author Response: The reviewer is not missing the point and
correct that movements following release will always be away from the capture/tagging
location and as such lead to displacement (Fig. 2). This is a logical result and as such not
analysed using a statistical procedure but simply displayed in a figure. This is now explicitly
stated in the methods (Lines: 170). In contrast, the parameters that are analysed in the GAM
and piecewise regression analyses (Figs 3& 4) are the actual dives or steps made that can
(potentially but not necessarily) lead to a displacement effect. Both pieces of information (Fig
2 and Figs 3&4) determine if an individual showed any responses to the tagging/handling and
the exposure event.
This issue not only applies to the capture/exposure, but also to the sound exposure. Imagine
an animal is moving from A to B, and at any point in-between one would record the distance
to the observer, it would lead to a decline and subsequent increase in distance, irrespective of
whether the animal shows any signs of avoidance. Also the distance of porpoise ID1 to the
exposure (Fig. 2, top panel) seem to highlight the risk of misinterpreting the figure/analysis.
Porpoise ID1, which remained within ~25 km prior to exposure (and also post-capture),
leaves the area afterwards. However, the first 4-5 hours after exposure it almost doesnt
increase its distance away from the exposure site (Fig. 2). Combined with very little evidence
for an increase in residual speed following exposure (Fig. 3,4), it is very likely that the
movement away is the result of a more natural movement process. Porpoises can be very
mobile, as is evident for e.g. ID4 who steadily moves >120 km after capture (and before
exposure).
**Response: Agreed, in our previous manuscript we concluded that the behavioural responses
following the noise exposure of porpoise ID 1 triggered long-term site displacement.
However, the reviewer correctly highlights that based on figure 2 there is no clear evidence
for an abrupt increase in displacement from the exposure site directly after the exposure.
Results of our reanalyses also confirm this, as we did not detect any abrupt responses to the
noise exposure in any of one of the movement parameters for this ID (new Figs. 4-5). We
have therefore rewritten the Results section (and summary) for porpoise ID 1 accordingly i.e.
this individual does not show behavioural responses nor long-term site displacement due to
noise exposure.
Now although it is stated in the manuscript and response to the comments by the reviewers
that the displacement is not directly used in the statistical testing, it does form the basis of the
main conclusion: Evidence of long-term displacement....
**Response: Following our response above, we no longer make a claim for Evidence of
long-term displacement neither in the title nor in the conclusion / discussion.
As stated by the authors, not this actual displacement, but parameters related to movement
and diving were used. However, looking at those parameters, no long-term (>2.5 days)
changes in behaviour are evident. For example, for porpoise ID3 the 3rd breakpoint
(reflecting the recovery) was very close to the 2nd breakpoint (reflecting the exposure). So
this does suggest rapid recovery. Also, irrespective of the analysis result, the parameters
related to diving and movement do not show long-term (>2.5 days) effects. Maybe 10 hours
max.
**Response: We agree with the reviewer that behavioural responses to the noise exposure
were short-term and individuals typically recovered rapidly (i.e. within hours not days). This
result is now even more evident from our reanalyses and is described explicitly in the
summary (Lines: 32), results (Lines: 331-363), and discussion (Lines: 374-378).
Furthermore, in my view the philosophy behind the statistical analysis is not correct. The
methods state: If the 95% CI of the second breakpoint overlapped with the time of airgun
exposure we took this as evidence that the behavioural change was influenced by the noise
exposure. This implies that if there is little information on the location of the second
breakpoint (i.e. airgun exposure), the CIs will be large, and there is a higher probability of
overlap. This is not a desirable statistical property, and will lead to a conclusion of evidence,
when in fact there is little information in data on where the break should be located.
For example Lines 291-292 read: Porpoise ID 1 showed a partial response to airgun noise
with an increase in speed between relocations for up to 21 hrs post-exposure (Fig 3, ESM,
Table S1) and directed movements (i.e., negative turning angle residuals; Fig. 3) post-
exposure. This is mostly explained by large CIs, which are (by definition) more likely to
overlap with the actual exposure event.
**Response: First, we would like to stress that sample size of residuals is equal (i.e. balanced)
over time and across individuals. This is one of the reasons why we aggregated the movement
data into hourly blocks so as to make sure that there were no gaps in the data (this is explicitly
stated in Lines: 219-222). Unbalanced data would indeed increase uncertainty in the
breakpoint analyses and where the breakpoint should be located, which is less of a concern
for our balanced data/analyses. Nonetheless, we do acknowledge that our previous criterion
for detecting a noise-induced behavioural response was somewhat weak (i.e. when the 95%
CI of the breakpoint overlapped with the time of the airgun exposure). As mentioned above,
we have reanalysed the data and we now use a much stricter criterion for such a result to be
accepted namely that the breakpoint itself has to align with the time (hour) of the airgun
exposure. We still calculate and show the 95% CI of the breakpoint using a bootstrap
procedure  but this mainly serves as an indication for how (un)certain the breakpoint
estimate is. We have rewritten the methods and results sections accordingly and updated the
figures. Although the bulk of the results remained unchanged (i.e. were similar to our
previous manuscript), one exception is that our latest models suggest that porpoise ID 1 did
not show a quantifiable response to the noise exposure, which we did detect with our previous
models.
**************************************************************************
So in summary: In my view the analysis is currently insufficient to claim evidence for long-
term (>2.5 days) displacement. For porpoise ID3 the data seem to suggest a behavioural
response, but this is only apparent for a few hours. And yes, it could be a trigger for the
animal to leave the area, but given the low sample size (4-5 porpoises), high mobility of the
species and short tracking/base-line period, this is in my view insufficient scientific evidence
to claim a long-term displacement caused by the airgun. The animal might have travelled to
another area, irrespective of the exposure.
**Response: Similar to our first response to this reviewer: we do agree that, based on our
previous (and new) results, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that short-term noise
exposure to a single airgun leads to long-term site displacement in harbour porpoises (we only
observed this for 1 out of 5 individuals). Therefore, we have carefully revised the manuscript
and removed all text where this was given as a fact. Moreover, we have changed the title of
our manuscript, have rewritten the summary and discussion where we put more focus on the
(new) results related to the short term behavioural responses and recovery period following
both types of anthropogenic disturbances used in our study (capture/handling and the noise
exposure).
*************************************************************************
Irrespective of the analysis, but simply looking at the data, Im not convinced the existing
data provides evidence for long-term avoidance. However in an attempt to be constructive,
some suggestions for improving the analysis:
- Both ID3 and ID5 appear to show a change in behaviour in response to the exposure
lasting for several hours. It is already interesting that a 1-minute exposure leads to such a
long effect (not days, but probably hours). You could dive in more depth here, e.g. by
estimating the change and recovery period.
**Response: We thank the reviewer for this and other comments below that relate to this
point. It made us re-evaluate our previous statistical procedure and it became clear that
we did not properly quantify and differentiate between a potential behavioural change
following the noise exposure and the subsequent recovery period. We have now corrected
for this by allowing for a 4th breakpoint in the data analyses. We also provide a new
Figure 3 where we demonstrate that 4 breakpoints are required if porpoises display 1) a
recovery period after capture/tagging, 2) a noise induced behavioural change, 3) recovery
period after a noise induced behavioural change and 4) baseline behaviour after recovery
period. Obviously this is an a priori expectation, but not all porpoises will respond in this
manner. Therefore and to let the results be purely data-driven, we compared AIC values
between models fitted with different nr of breakpoints (between 0 [a linear model] and 6
breakpoints - models with more than 5 breakpoints typically did not converge) and we
choose the model with lowest AIC as our best estimate. Starting values of breakpoints
were supplied by splitting up the tracking period into equally spaced periods (K
parameter in the segmented package in R). We believe the refined procedure is more
objective and allows us to provide more detail on the duration of the behavioural response
and recovery period of 2 disturbance events.
- - The data on post-capture behaviour is very interesting. All animals seem to respond
heavily and in some cases this appears to last for several hours. E.g. the residual speed
seems close to 5 m/s. Assuming a mean speed of 1 m/s, actual speed is even higher? That
is really fast. This can be a solid basis for future behavioural response studies.
**Response: Indeed, we have added a paragraph to the discussion where we elaborate on
these results and the implications for future behavioural studies, with and without
exposure (Lines: 380-394).
- - The data is now summarized into hourly blocks. Might be good to show the immediate
response, and illustrate how a behavioural change is prolonged over longer time-periods.
**Response: Plots of the raw data are provided in the Supplementary Material (Figs S6
and S7) where the immediate response to the airgun exposure and tagging is visualized.
However, as we explain above and mention in the ms text (Lines: 219-222) for the actual
analyses we had to use hourly blocks as this was the finest temporal scale we could attain
without creating gaps in the horizontal movement data due to lack of GPS locations
(causing unbalanced sample design) and to sufficiently reduce temporal autocorrelation in
the data needed for robust inference in piece-wise linear regression (See Figs S8 and S9).
We have previously tried to statistically analyse the immediate response without
aggregating the data (and using mixed effects models to account for unbalanced data) but
we were unable to i) reduce the temporal autocorrelation and ii) account for natural
behaviour sufficiently, making robust inference difficult/impossible using such a
statistical approach.
- Instead of using piece-wise regression, where the lines are connected, a variable intercept-
model would seem more logical for capturing abrupt changes in behaviour. E.g. for the ID5
some abrupt changes in behaviour are apparent (e.g. post-dive duration), but this does not
seem to be appropriately captured by the piece-wise regression (Fig 4). In my view a more
robust analysis would be: create fake exposure events and measure the behavioural change
before and after the fake event. Repeat this to create a random distribution of the test
statistics. Subsequently do this for the real exposure and test whether the behavioural change
is in the tail of this distribution.
**Response: We agree with the reviewer that there are a number of approaches to analyse this
data where abrupt changes in behaviour are expected/to be estimated. Although the reviewer
briefly suggests an alternative method we feel that piecewise regression is better suited for
our purposes. The advantage of using piecewise regression over the complete time-series as
we do here is that we can quantify the behavioural changes of two disturbance events in one
model, facilitating comparison of the impact directly and in one model  and at the same time
assess whether behaviour is normal prior to exposure. As such, we have decided not to
reanalyse the data using a completely new statistical approach. Instead, we have reanalysed
the data using a more elaborate and objective procedure as mentioned above and as stated in
section f of the method. The refinement of our statistical procedure also improved model fit,
as some of the abrupt changes in behaviour are now better captured by the piece-wise
regression compared to the results in our previous manuscript (e.g. post-dive duration of
porpoise ID 5).
Nonetheless, we fully agree that alternative approaches for analyses of these data are
possible and we make one specific recommendation for future analyses where behavioural
responses can be quantified by combining different data streams of varying resolution
(hierarchical time series analyses) so that all movement parameters can be combined
concomitantly to evaluate a behavioural response (Lines: 428-437 and sensu Leos Barajas et
al. 2017).
Some other comments
Line 150-155: In shallow water, airgun pulses are subject to a high pass filtering effect,
causing the sound energy at higher frequencies above 1 kHz relative to total broadband
energy to increase with increasing range [35,37]. To account for this, SELs were frequency
weighted with a harbour porpoise audiogram [38,39] using the method from Hermannsen et
al. [35], which gave an approximation of porpoises having experienced weighted SELs of
112-116 dB re 1 µPa2 s (audiogram-weighted) resulting from the airgun exposures (Fig. 1).
There appear to be two issues mentioned here: 1) There is frequency dependent attenuation,
which implies that the relative frequency spectrum near the source is different from larger
distances. 2) Not all frequencies are equally audible to the porpoise, and hence a porpoise
weighted audiogram is employed. The text currently suggest that a solution for 2 is used to
combat problem 1 (i.e. to account for this)? Please clarify.
**Response: We agree with the reviewer that these are two different issues that are
independent of each other and one cannot be used to combat the other. The high pass filtering
previously mentioned has no effect on how porpoises hear the signal, and we have changed
the text accordingly to only focus on the hearing aspect, which is why we perform the
frequency weighting (Lines: 160-165). The high pass filtering is mainly relevant in
Hermannsen et al. (2015) to describe the proportionally higher loss of energy at frequencies
lower than 1 kHz compared to the higher frequencies (in a shallow water environment). This
is however, of less importance for porpoises as they have their best hearing at the higher
frequencies.
Line 205: We extracted the residuals of each GAM model ...
Which residuals were extracted? Raw, Pearson, standardized, and conditional or marginal?
**Response: Raw residuals were extracted (data minus fitted values) at the conditional
(individual) level. This is now mentioned explicitly in the text (Lines: 214-219).
Line 229-230: This allowed us to formally compare the behavioural response effect of two
types of anthropogenic disturbances (capture/tagging and exposure to airgun noise).
So prior to the airgun exposure it is possible to define a baseline and capture a sudden change
in behaviour. However, for the capture/tagging it is only possible to measure a recovery
period, which is probably smoother.
**Response: The reviewer is correct and we greatly appreciate this comment as it formed the
basis for our re-analyses. By allowing for another (potential) breakpoint after the noise
induced behavioural response (if present) we are now able to also quantify the duration of the
recovery period following the noise exposure.
Line 252: The validity of a breakpoint was determined by the gap coefficient and
corresponding t-value.
Please clarify gap coefficient.
**Response: We have rewritten this sentence to better describe how the validity of
breakpoints was evaluated (Lines: 283-286).
General point discussion:
A large part of the discussion focuses on whether the experimental sound exposure is
representative for more real seismic surveys (and pile driving), which is proposed by one
reviewer. But in my view one needs to take a step back: does the experimental exposure
really lead to considerable long-term behavioural changes, what are these changes and what is
the implication? The long-term avoidance is presented as a fact, and the discussion is to a
large extend devoted to explaining why individual long-term displacement is relevant. I
would like to see a more in-depth discussion on whether the main conclusion is indeed
correct.
**Response: We have rewritten parts of the Discussion to remove any claim of long-term
displacement. Instead, we now focus more on the short-term behavioural responses and
recovery period following anthropogenic disturbances and the implications of our results for
future behavioural/movement ecological studies and research that aims to assess how short-
term behavioural disturbances can impact populations.
Appendix D
Dear Authors and Editor,
First of all, I very much appreciate the effort the authors have put into addressing all the
comments of the reviewers, carrying out new analysis and changing the main message of the
manuscript. The paper is well written, and highly relevant for the research field related to the
mpact of sound on marine organisms. I have a few minor comments, but I trust that these will
be dealt with if necessary. All line numbers below relate to the document with track-changes
visible.
Line 154-157: Because we did not know the exact location of the individuals at the start of
he exposures, the exposure ranges accommodated a 50% error in distance, as we expected
he true location of the individuals during the exposures to be within this range. 
From the visual observations it might have been hard to estimate the distance, but presumably
t is possible to estimate it from the GPS locations? Or is the inaccuracy caused by having
gaps in-between the GPS locations?
Line 281-283: Although equally spaced starting values for breakpoints were provided, the
models were allowed sufficient tolerance to search for breakpoints with a potentially better fit
along the complete time gradient.
Could you elaborate on how this is done exactly? Is the location of the break-point a
parameter estimated by the model?
Fig. 2:
The model suggest a gradual increase in the movement residual from the sound exposure
onwards. For this particular example (Fig. 2), also the data seems to suggest a gradual
ncrease. For other, animals and exposures (Fig. 4 and 5), the change appears to often be more
abrupt. I still find this a bit odd. If an animal is exposed, I would expect an immediate
esponse, and thus also an immediate change in movement. Could you elaborate a bit on this?
All the best, Geert
Appendix E
We have revised the manuscript in accordance with the minor comments provided by you and one
reviewer. Below is a detailed list in which we explain how all minor comments provided by the AE and
one reviewer were handled (starting with **Response:).
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Line 259: delete more. The term increasingly more complex is redundant.
**Response: Agreed, we have deleted the word more from this sentence.
Lines 26, 195, 315, 320, 350: wiggliness. Im still not sure what this means, despite what seems to
be an attempt at a definition in lines 195-7. Either define it more clearly, or substitute another word
(circuitous?)
**Response: We now define dive wiggliness as: .the absolute vertical distance (m) moved at the
bottom phase of each dive, which is often used as an index of prey chasing behaviour or foraging
intensity . (Lines: 196-197). This is a rather standard definition of dive wiggliness and we have added
two references that have used similar definitions for this dive characteristic.
Line 374: it might be more accurate to say lasted for up to 24 hours.
**Response: Agreed, we have changed this sentence accordingly.
Line 440: the idea that animals in poorer condition should be less likely to displace from good foraging
habitat is rather speculative despite the mass/length data in Table 1; I would change should be
expected to might be expected.
**Response: As suggested the wording in this sentence is changed from should be . To may be 
In the authors discussion, its worth briefly citing another recent paper from this journal on response to
noise, Falcone et al. 2017 (Royal Society Open Science, DOI: 10.1098/rsos.170629).
**Response: Thank you for the tip, the suggested reference has been cited in the text (new reference
56).
Reviewer 3 Comments to Author:
Line 154-157: Because we did not know the exact location of the individuals at the start of the
exposures, the exposure ranges accommodated a 50% error in distance, as we expected the true
location of the individuals during the exposures to be within this range.  From the visual observations it
might have been hard to estimate the distance, but presumably it is possible to estimate it from the GPS
locations? Or is the inaccuracy caused by having gaps in-between the GPS locations?
**Response: Correct, we were able to extract the location of the individual porpoises prior and after the
airgun exposure using the GPS data as stated in lines 153-154. However, and as correctly highlighted by
the reviewer, due to variable time lags between GPS locations, we could not calculate the exact location
at the start of exposure. Even interpolation of the GPS track would not give a location with high
certainty. Instead we adopted a conservative approach and calculated the mean sound exposure levels
across the range of +- 50% around the estimated distance from the porpoise to the airgun. We can be
rather certain that the individual was within this distance range at the start of the exposure. We have
added more detail to this section to clarify this point.
Line 281-283: Although equally spaced starting values for breakpoints were provided, the models were
allowed sufficient tolerance to search for breakpoints with a potentially better fit along the complete time
gradient. Could you elaborate on how this is done exactly? Is the location of the break-point a
parameter estimated by the model?
**Response: When using piecewise linear regression, starting values of potential breakpoints need to be
supplied. In the segmented package in R, these starting values can be spaced equally along the
explanatory variable by invoking the parameter K (as described in Lines: 282-284). Because we used a
bootstrap procedure, the model starts evaluating breakpoints at the supplied starting values but because
we used a low tolerance (i.e. the model is allowed to search for breakpoints elsewhere) the model
compares starting values with breakpoints with a potentially better fit along the complete gradient (in
our case time since release). So the reviewer is correct that the optimal location of the breakpoint(s) is
estimated by the model (this is the main argument for using such analyses as explained in lines 238-
241).
Fig. 2: The model suggest a gradual increase in the movement residual from the sound exposure
onwards. For this particular example (Fig. 2), also the data seems to suggest a gradual increase. For
other, animals and exposures (Fig. 4 and 5), the change appears to often be more abrupt. I still find this
a bit odd. If an animal is exposed, I would expect an immediate response, and thus also an immediate
change in movement. Could you elaborate a bit on this?
**Response: Indeed, we have amended Fig. 2 (Demonstration figure of expected behavioural
responses) to better illustrate that the noise-induced response is an abrupt change as also observed in
the real porpoises (Figs 4 & 5).
