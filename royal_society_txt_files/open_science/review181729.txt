This manuscript is about the development, simulation, and analysis of a running model to
understand the stability of running on uneven ground. The disc-like model was tested with both
an open-loop strategy (without sensory feedback) and an anticipatory strategy that serves to
minimize tangential collisions. Instabilities related to body orientation (orientational instability)
and forward motion (translational instability) were explored with Monte Carlo simulations. The
authors found that open-loop strategies cannot handle rough terrain due to orientational stability
but can manage step-like terrain. In contrast, anticipatory strategies can achieve orientational
stability and handle rough terrain but lose translational stability through loss of forward speed.
Further analysis showed that mean steps to failure can be captured by the ratio between the
orientational threshold and the orientation change over one step.
This manuscript was generally well-written and clear. The graphs are descriptive and help
support the points mentioned in the text. The authors were thorough in explaining their method,
results, and providing further linear stability analysis to understand their results. The flow of
derivations and explanations was generally smooth despite 28 references to the supplementary
material. The authors also included a constructive discussion on the merits and limitations of
their model and their results in the context of biological behavior. I only have minor comments.
Minor Comments
Title is short and pithy but a bit too general. Perhaps it would benefit from a key takeaway from
the results.
It would serve the reader better to mention earlier in the manuscript that the model was disc-like,
closer to the beginning of Section 2 than the end. I puzzled over Figure 1b for a while trying to
figure out if the disc was intentional or not until I reached the last few sentences of Section 2.
Figure 1a would be clearer with an actual aerial phase shown in the human outline.
A few items are a bit unclear. It is probably worth repeating in the beginning of Section 3 that first
the impulses from flat ground on determined for steady-state running and then maintained for
the rough terrain simulations. The parameters being adjusted in the simulation are not clear.
Perhaps repeating the e_tc was varied would be useful. It is also unclear how angular impulse
was maintained. The angular impulse was mentioned early in the manuscript but not again until
near the end. Was it always set to 0?
Page 9 Line 208/47: It is unclear which experiments “in experiments” is being referred. Is this
referring to the simulation? Or referencing human or animal experiments?

The paper addresses open-loop and anticipatory strategies for running on rough terrain using a
simple math model. They perform Monte Carlo simulations to assess the likelihood of failure
using open-loop and “anticipatory” strategies. The authors correlate successful running to
practical dynamical concerns, like the degree of energy dissipation per step. I believe it is a well-
thought-out contribution and would only require minor changes in framing to merit publication.
The material is thoroughly communicated and well-written. The supplementary materials are
similarly thorough. The locomotion math model is well motivated and elegantly designed to
capture some of the key dynamics of running. I am heartened the authors are using “mean steps
to failure” as a stability metric, because it seems most appropriate in the context of stochastic
terrain. The method of modeling noises in anticipatory running is also solid.
I would like to see the authors address the limits of their “anticipatory strategy.” The authors
rightly reference Byl and Tedrake for using a “look-ahead” strategy. I’m not convinced that the
authors’ anticipatory strategy is sufficiently powerful of a control model to reflect an optimal
running behavior, or what I would consider truly “anticipatory” over multiple steps. I would like
to see the authors draw a direct contrast between their anticipatory approach and the Byl 2009
approach when describing their control modeling approach.
The title is succinct and punchy, but perhaps overly broad. This paper primarily addresses
relatively open-loop strategies to running on rough terrain. There are, by contrast, approaches
that use high-level planning that could plan over many steps of rough terrain. Also, this glosses
over a lot of the control complexity associated with runners with multi-body models, specifically
those with compliance. I would recommend including a reference in the title to the fact that
you’re analyzing simple models, maybe “How to run on rough terrains: lessons from a simple
model.” Obviously, the style of title would be up to the authors, but I think that the study does
need to be bounded in scope a bit given the complexity of the field.

he illustration of a human runner is based on motion capture data from a
eal human runner. We included it in its present form so that the reader
ay visually assess the change in configuration of the body during

troke types for the stance and aerial phases.
. "It is probably worth repeating in the beginning of Section 3 that

he paragraph that immediately precedes section 3 states this in lines
48-150 and 156-169. However, we can see how a well-placed repetition of
his detail will aid the reader. Therefore, we remind the reader in the
iscussion section on line 432-433: "Recall that for a chosen pair of
\epsilon_n$ and $\epsilon_{tc}$, the active push-off impulse is

teady, periodic gait on flat terrain and held fixed thereafter. For a
teady gait, the angular impulse $J_\phi = 0$ at all times, whereas the

Our analyses are restricted to considerations of single-step
nticipatory strategies.
ore general anticipatory strategies that rely on foreknowledge of the
errain for multiple steps have been previously considered for walking on
ough terrains, both theoretically and experimentally
citep{Raibert2008,Byl2009}. In walking, \citet{Byl2009} find that a one-
tep lookahead policy performs almost as well as an optimal strategy that
ses complete upcoming terrain information to plan footholds. Whether
nticipatory strategies in running have similar diminishing gains with
dditional foreknowledge is beyond the scope of the present analysis.

f multi-step planning strategies by allowing the active impulses and the
ollision parameters to vary as a function of the oncoming terrain."

Abstract
Stability of running on rough terrain depends on the propagation of perturbations due to the
ground. We consider stability within the sagittal plane and model the dynamics of running as a
two-dimensional body with alternating aerial and stance phases. Stance is modeled as a passive,
impulsive collision followed by an active, impulsive push-o<U+21B5> that compensates for collisional losses.
Such a runner has infinitely many strategies to maintain periodic gaits on flat ground. However,
these strategies di<U+21B5>er in how perturbations due to terrain unevenness are propagated. Instabilities
manifest as tumbling (orientational instability) or failing to maintain a steady speed (translational
instability). We find that open-loop strategies that avoid sensory feedback are sufficient to maintain
stability on step-like terrains with piecewise flat surfaces that randomly vary in height. However,
these open-loop runners lose orientational stability on rough terrains whose slope also varies ran-
domly. The orientational instability is significantly mitigated by minimizing the tangential collision,
which typically requires sensory information and anticipatory strategies such as leg retraction. By
analyzing the propagation of perturbations, we derive a single dimensionless parameter that gov-
erns stability. This parameter provides guidelines for the design and control of both biological and
robotic runners.

1 Introduction
Legged terrestrial animals run stably on rough terrains, despite potential difficulties such as sensory
latencies and the highly dynamic nature of running. Our current understanding of how running
animals negotiate rough terrains is based on studies where the animal experiences obstacles in the
form of a single step up or down [1, 2], or a random sequence of up and down steps [3, 4]. However,
natural terrains exhibit not only variations in height but also in slope, and it is unclear how our
understanding of running on step-like terrains translates to such natural terrains.
Mathematical studies of running over rough terrains reflect the experiments and focus on stabil-
ity when running on step-like terrains that are piecewise flat [5–7]. Furthermore, models of runners
with massless legs, such as the spring-legged-inverted-pendulum (SLIP) [8–10], cannot distinguish
between di<U+21B5>erent slopes of the terrain and only respond to variations in height. Assuming a mass-
less leg enforces the ground reaction force vector to always align with the leg [11] regardless of the
terrain’s slope beneath the foot. More detailed models that mimic the anatomy of specific animals
or robots avoid this limitation of SLIP models [7], at the cost of generalizability. Thus there is a
need for generalizable models of running that incorporate dependence on both terrain slope and
height, and yet remain sufficiently abstract to glean principles that may underlie stability on rough
terrains.
Stability may be governed by many factors, including sensory feedback control [12–14], the
inherently stabilizing mechanical response of the animal’s body [15], energy dissipation within
the body [1], and feed-forward strategies such as swing-leg retraction [16]. The slowest is often
sensory feedback control that has latencies comparable to or greater than the stance duration. For
example, at endurance running speeds for humans, the stance lasts around 200 ms [17] and only
slightly longer than the shortest proprioceptive feedback delay of 70–100 ms or visual feedback
delay of 150–200 ms [18]. To better understand the inherent stability or instability of the dynamics
of running, we consider only passive mechanical and anticipatory strategies in this study without
relying on active feedback control.
Studies of running birds and the role of open-loop stability of running find that increased energy
dissipation during stance may help stability when faced with an unexpected drop in terrain height
[1]. Consistent with the role of energy dissipation, experiments with humans find that metabolic

power increases by 5% to run on step-like terrains versus flat ground [4]. Walking over rough
terrains leads to an increase of 28% in metabolic power [19], higher in both relative and absolute
terms. The di<U+21B5>erence in energetics may indicate that the dynamics of running are inherently less
unstable, but such an analysis on natural rough terrains has not been carried out. Therefore, we
incorporate energy dissipation in our examination of open-loop strategies to address the e<U+21B5>ect of
dissipation on stability.
Not relying on feedback control within a single stance does not preclude active strategies that
rely on anticipation or internal models, sometimes called feed-forward strategies. Computational
studies of walking have demonstrated the role of look-ahead strategies that use the height and slope
of the oncoming terrain in planning the control [20]. Evidence for the importance of feed-forward
strategies for running come from computational studies of SLIP-like running dynamics [16] that
show how swing-leg retraction automatically modulates the landing angle in response to unexpected
variations in the terrain height. However, these studies on running have not yet considered the
e<U+21B5>ect of slope variations in the terrain. Thus in our study, we analyze anticipatory strategies that
incorporate the slope of the oncoming terrain.
An extreme and simplified approximation of running is that of a point mass with an impulsive
and instantaneous stance followed by projectile flight. Such an approximation appears as a natural
solution to the problem of minimizing measures of metabolic energy consumption when the desired
forward speed exceeds critical levels, and subject to other constraints such as step length [21].
SLIP-like models are an unfolding of these point-mass instantaneous-stance models to have finite
stance duration. They have helped us understand the kinetics of stance [15] and the energetics of
producing forces [21] on flat terrains, and the role of swing-leg retraction on piecewise flat terrains
[6]. However, these point-mass models possess no sense of body orientation during the aerial phase
and are therefore immune to falling by tumbling.
In this study, we unfold the point-mass, instantaneous-stance model by using a finite moment
of inertia for the runner, while still maintaining an impulsive stance. A finite moment of inertia
defines a body orientation and thus enables the examination of the e<U+21B5>ect of angular momentum
fluctuations induced by stance. Such a model maps the net e<U+21B5>ect of the ground forces over stance
as a linear impulse applied at the contact point and an angular impulse applied at the center of
mass. These impulses lead to a change in the linear and angular momentum of the whole runner
3
because of the passive and active forces during stance. As we discuss later, the angular impulse
captures the e<U+21B5>ect of a finite stance duration and configuration changes during stance.
Section 2 develops a sagittal-plane model that incorporates a finite moment of inertia, inelastic
2D collisions, and an active push-o<U+21B5> so that both terrain slope and height variations a<U+21B5>ect stability.
In section 3, we use Monte Carlo simulations with random variation of ground height and slope
to examine open-loop strategies, the e<U+21B5>ects of energy dissipation, and strategies that anticipate
the slope of the terrain. Section 4 derives the linearized dynamical equations and analyzes their
stability. Using the linearization, we find a single dimensionless parameter that governs stability in
section 5, which in turn guides morphological design for stability. We conclude in section 6 with a
discussion of the limitations and generality of our analyses, its relationship to experimental results,
and generate testable predictions for future experiments.

2.1 Aerial and stance phases
A single step is comprised of an aerial and a stance phase. The aerial phase is modeled as a drag-
free projectile in uniform gravity. Stance involves two successive parts: a passive collision with the
ground followed by an active push-o<U+21B5>. The passive collision is two-dimensional and parameterized
by two coefficients of restitution; <U+270F>n along the normal to the ground and <U+270F>t along the tangent to the
ground. The active push-o<U+21B5> applies a linear impulse J imp at the contact point P and a rotational

linear impulse J imp at the contact point P, and the e<U+21B5>ect of additional torques about the center
of mass arising from configuration changes during stance are captured by an angular impulse J
at the center of mass. At the end of the aerial phase, the runner undergoes a passive collision
with the ground at the new contact point P. The momentum lost due to the collision in directions
tangential and normal to the terrain surface is dictated by the parameters <U+270F>t and <U+270F>n , respectively.

Horizontal and vertical positions are denoted by x and y, respectively, orientation by , velocity
by v, angular velocity by !, and angular momentum by H. Subscripts of ‘t’ and ‘n’ refer to the
tangential and normal directions to the terrain, while subscripts of ‘x’ and ‘y’ refer to the horizontal
and vertical directions in the lab frame (Fig. 1b). Superscript ‘ ’ denotes variables immediately
preceding the collision, ‘c’ after the passive collision and ‘+’ after the active push-o<U+21B5>. Subscripts
P and G refer to quantities associated with the contact point and center of mass, respectively.
The mechanical state of the runner is parameterized by the center of mass positions (xG , yG ),
body orientation , and their respective velocities (vG,x , vG,y ) and !. Because the stance is assumed
to be instantaneous, the velocities may change discontinuously but the position and orientation
remain constant during stance. The instantaneous stance assumption also implies that finite forces
such as gravity or air-drag do not contribute to the impulse on the runner. However, the active
rotational impulse J applied at the center of mass G captures the e<U+21B5>ects of varying posture over
stance and the changing center of pressure on the ground. We examine this approximation and its
implications in the discussion.
2.2 Stance: passive collision
The passive collision has two components, the normal and the tangential, which are parametrized
by <U+270F>n and <U+270F>t , respectively. Modulating these coefficients of restitution would exert control over the
passive collision. We hold these parameters constant from step-to-step and examine the e<U+21B5>ect of
di<U+21B5>erent values on stability.
An animal may vary the extent to which the normal momentum impinging on the terrain is
stored elastically and later used for push-o<U+21B5>. Without detailed consideration of how an animal may
accomplish this, we allow our model to precisely specify <U+270F>n . The normal collision is perfectly elastic
for <U+270F>n = 1 and perfectly inelastic for <U+270F>n = 0.
The tangential collision directly a<U+21B5>ects the body’s angular momentum. We therefore elaborate
the model to consider di<U+21B5>erent ways in which this collision may be controlled. One strategy for an
animal to modulate the tangential collision is to vary the foot speed along the terrain’s tangential
direction. For the same speed of the center of mass, the foot speed may be varied through actions
such as retracting the leg. However, control of the foot’s speed relative to the terrain’s tangential
direction requires sensory information on the ground speed and the terrain’s slope. In our model,
6
this corresponds to knowledge of vP,t , the speed of the contact point along the terrain’s tangent
in the moment just before the collision. We consider two extremes for the availability of such
sensory information. At one extreme is an open-loop strategy that has no information and assumes
vP,t = vx0 , which implies three assumptions: forward speed equals the initial speed, the terrain is
flat, and the body has no spin. In this case, the intended tangential coefficient of restitution <U+270F>tc
and the actual coefficient <U+270F>t would generally not equal each other and depend on the ratio vx0 /vP,t .
At the other extreme is an anticipatory strategy with perfect a priori information so that <U+270F>tc = <U+270F>t .
These are summarized as, 8

> vx0
<<U+270F> tc v : open-loop,
<U+270F>t = P,t
(2)

:<U+270F>tc : anticipatory.
We derive this equation (2) more formally in supplement S3.2, and examine the relationship between
<U+270F>tc and <U+270F>t for the open-loop strategy in supplement S4.1.
2.3 Stance: active push-o<U+21B5>
Stance ends with the application of an active, linear push-o<U+21B5> impulse J imp at the contact point P
and an active angular push-o<U+21B5> impulse J at the center of mass G. We constrain these impulses so
that in the absence of external perturbations or other disturbances the runner is perfectly periodic
and remains upright ( (t) = 0) on flat ground. Importantly, once the impulses are chosen for flat
ground, they are not allowed to vary step-to-step on any other terrain to reflect the absence of
active feedback control. Together, these conditions imply that the active push-o<U+21B5> impulses J imp
and J depend only on <U+270F>n , <U+270F>tc , vx0 and vy0 , and no other parameters, according to

J = 0. (3b)
Thus the center of mass of a periodic runner on flat ground has a constant forward speed vx0 and
vertical speed vy0 at every step.
On rough terrains, there are two options for defining the application of the invariant linear
impulse on every step. First, the impulse vector J imp may be held constant in every step with
7
respect to gravity (x^ y^ frame in Fig. 1b), which we call the lab-fixed push-o<U+21B5> policy. Second,
the impulse vector may be held constant in every step with respect to the normal direction to the
terrain at the point of contact (t^ n^ frame in Fig. 1b), which we call a terrain-fixed push-o<U+21B5> policy.
The terrain-fixed policy may be considered a better approximation of what animals do, because
the normal to the terrain and the leg orientation are often coupled, whereas leg orientation at
contact and gravity may vary from step to step. Implicit in preferring the terrain-fixed policy is the
assumption that joint torques to apply forces are planned in an ego-centric (body-fixed) frame of
reference. For the disc-like model of a runner that we use, the terrain-fixed and body-fixed policies
are identical. Detailed expressions for the velocities in the stance phase, as well as expressions for
J imp under both push-o<U+21B5> policies are given in supplement S3. We present a complete analysis of
the lab-fixed push-o<U+21B5> policy in supplement S10 and focus on the terrain-fixed policy in the main
paper. The active linear and angular impulses were found for a steady, periodic gait on flat terrain
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
and held fixed thereafter. For a steady gait, the angular impulse J = 0 at all times, whereas the

3 Monte Carlo simulations
A sagittal plane runner can only fail by two modes, when the body orientation exceeds a chosen
threshold (orientational failure), or by failing to move forward any longer (translational failure).
We choose the orientational threshold tol as the angle of tilt to passively topple a human who is
standing with their feet apart in a pose resembling double-stance in walking.

Stability is quantified by the mean steps to failure, like previous studies of rough terrain walking

The terrain is modeled as a piecewise linear interpolation of an underlying random grid. The grid
points are separated by a distance and the heights h of the grid points are chosen from a uniform
random distribution (table 1, supplement S1.3). A linear interpolation between the grid points
yields a terrain with random variations in both slope and height. Corners at grid point implies an

indeterminate slope, and we therefore define an e<U+21B5>ective slope at the grid points by interpolating
the slope before and after the point (details in supplement S1.4). Parameter values that represent
a human-like runner (table 1) are used for all Monte Carlo simulations, unless indicated otherwise.
3.1 Open-loop runners on rough terrains
Open-loop runners always fail through an orientational instability on rough terrains regardless of
the energy dissipated per step (Fig. 2a,d). The open-loop runners with human-like inertia and size
take 9.6 ± 4.1 steps (mean ± standard deviation) before tumbling while only 1% of the runners fall
within 3 steps (Fig. 2a). Decreasing <U+270F>n from 1 to 0 increases the mean steps to failure by just 2 steps
(Fig. 2d). Thus, dissipating more energy per step in the normal collision has minimal influence
on stability. The tangential collision, parameterized by <U+270F>tc , has little or no influence because the
contour lines of the mean steps to failure are nearly parallel to the <U+270F>tc axis (Fig. 2d). Therefore,
energy dissipation or modulating the tangential collision are both ine<U+21B5>ective stabilization strategies
for purely open-loop runners.
3.2 Open-loop runners on step-like terrains
The purely open-loop runner remains stable on step-like terrains that are piecewise flat and possess
only height variations (Fig. 2b). This is because forward and vertical dynamics are decoupled on
piecewise flat terrains, and hence the open-loop runner does not fall as long as the step height is
smaller than the apex height of the aerial phase. This result suggests a foot placement strategy for
running on any rough terrain, namely to aim to land on flat patches of the ground so that stability
is maintained with little reliance on feedback control. However, such a strategy would require
visual surveying of the terrain up ahead and planning the location of foot falls. Increased footfall

3.3 E<U+21B5>ect of terrain geometry
The exact step-to-step variation in the terrain’s height and slope depend on the distribution func-
tion used to generate the random terrain (Fig. 2e, inset). However, we find that the distribution
underlying the rough terrain has little e<U+21B5>ect on the distribution of the steps to failure (Fig. 2e)
when assessed using three di<U+21B5>erent functions to generate rough terrains: von Mises, uniform and
beta. Runners took 9.6 ± 4.1 (mean ± std. dev.) steps before tumbling on terrains characterized by
von Mises and uniform distributions, and 10.8 ± 4.7 steps on the terrains characterized by the beta
distribution. All steps to failure distributions are unimodal, but skewed. A Markov model for the
step-to-step dynamics (supplement S8) lends insight into the nearly invariant shape of the steps-
to-failure distribution. The insensitivity may arise from the terrain roughness being uncorrelated
from step-to-step (terrain’s correlation length <U+2327> 1), and thus the net e<U+21B5>ect of the perturbations
resembles a Gaussian noise process that is propagated by the dynamics of running.
3.4 Anticipatory runners on rough terrains: tangential collisions
Runners that use anticipatory strategies to control the tangential passive collision maintain ori-
entational stability if they entirely avoid tangential collisions using <U+270F>tc = 1. But these runners
eventually fail by completely losing forward momentum (Fig. 2c). Recall that because of the ac-
tive push-o<U+21B5>, the loss of forward momentum is not simply a break of symmetry by the passive
tangential collision. Through a more careful analysis, we find that the mean slope encountered by
the runners is positive and not zero, i.e. the terrain preferentially impedes the forward momentum
(supplement Fig. S10d). For human-like parameters, anticipatory runners take 75 ± 40.9 (mean
± std. dev) steps before completely losing forward momentum and only 1% of the runners stop
moving forward within 15 steps. In contrast, over 80% of the open-loop runners fail within 15 steps.
For the anticipatory runner, permitting tangential collisions <U+270F>tc < 1 induces orientational failures
and the mean steps to failure decreases. For example, with <U+270F>n = 0 the mean steps to failure when
<U+270F>tc = 1 is 85 and decreases to 20 when <U+270F>tc = 0.95 (Fig. 3a). A 5% decrease in <U+270F>tc caused an

stability for a human-like runner, found using Monte Carlo simulations. a, Open-loop runners with
<U+270F>tc = 0 (orange circles) lose orientational stability on the rough terrain while anticipatory runners
with <U+270F>tc = 1 (blue squares) maintain orientation. b, On the step-like terrain, open-loop runners
(purple star) maintain forward speed and orientation as the probability of failure, orientational
or translational, is zero. Open-loop and anticipatory runners are identical on step-like terrains c,
Anticipatory runners slow down on the rough terrain, eventually completely losing forward speed.
Whereas human-like open-loop runners also lose forward speed, they lose orientational stability
before completely losing forward momentum. d, A contour plot of mean steps taken by open-loop
runners as a function of <U+270F>tc and <U+270F>n finds that contours are approximately parallel to the <U+270F>tc axis,
while the steps taken increases with decreasing <U+270F>n . e, Steps to failure distributions for human-
like open-loop runners on rough terrain with height distributions for the grid points drawn from
von Mises (yellow diamond, mean = 0, <U+F8FF> = 6), Beta (dark red square, <U+21B5> = 1.9, = 2.3) and uniform
distributions (blue circle). The inset shows the three di<U+21B5>erent probability density functions used
to generate the terrain: von Mises (yellow), Beta (dark red) and uniform (blue). The distributions
were scaled and shifted such that mean height = 0, and range = 0.060r` (table 1, supplement S1.2).
over three-fold decrease in the mean steps to failure. Importantly, the dominant mode of failure
switches from translational failures to orientational failures (supplement Fig. S5a). At <U+270F>tc = 0 and
independent of <U+270F>n , the anticipatory and open-loop strategies are identical. Thus the anticipatory
runner substantially improves stability by avoiding tangential collisions.
Increasing energy dissipation in the normal collision increases the number of steps taken by
the anticipatory runner. For example, at <U+270F>tc = 1, where runners only fail by losing forward speed,
increasing energy dissipation by changing from <U+270F>n = 1 to <U+270F>n = 0, increases the mean number of steps
taken before failure by two-fold, from 40 to 85 (Fig. 3a). Away from <U+270F>tc = 1, energy dissipation

has a smaller e<U+21B5>ect on stability. When <U+270F>tc <U+21E1> 0, the anticipatory runners resemble the open-loop
runners and the mean steps to failure increases by only 2 steps despite <U+270F>n decreasing from 1 to
0 (Fig. 3a). Thus, for the anticipatory runner using <U+270F>tc <U+21E1> 1, increasing energy dissipation in the
direction normal to the terrain is an e<U+21B5>ective means to improve stability, unlike for the open-loop
runner.
3.5 Noise in anticipatory strategies
The sensitivity of the steps to failure with respect to tangential collisions prompts an examination
of the e<U+21B5>ect of stochasticity in how a runner may control the tangential collision. After all, no
runner can exactly control the tangential collision from step-to-step. For example, errors in sensing
the terrain profile as well as motor noise may prevent accurate implementation of a desired <U+270F>tc . We
model such sources of noise in controlling the tangential collision as
<U+270F>t,noisy = <U+270F>tc + <U+270F>t <U+2318>, (4a)
where <U+2318> s U [ 1, 1], <U+270F>t 2 R. (4b)
12
The uniformly distributed zero-mean random variable <U+2318> models random step-to-step noise in <U+270F>tc
and <U+270F>t is the noise intensity. The noisy <U+270F>t,noisy is allowed to exceed 1 in our simulations.
We find that incurring tangential collisions (<U+270F>tc < 1) is optimal when there is non-zero noise
( <U+270F>t > 0). This is unlike the noiseless anticipatory runner whose optimum is <U+270F>tc = 1. Moreover,
noise in controlling tangential collisions does a<U+21B5>ect stability and the mean steps to failure are
severely reduced (Fig. 3b). For example, compared to a noiseless human-like runner, the mean
steps to failure drops nine-fold for a runner with noise intensity <U+270F>t = 0.1, and the optimum <U+270F>tc
decreases by 1% to <U+270F>tc = 0.99 (Fig. 3b). Additional noise in the tangential collision of open-loop
runners reduces the number of steps taken, but does not alter the dependence of steps taken on <U+270F>tc
(supplement S4.2). Therefore, for anticipatory runners, noise in controlling the tangential collision
implies that incurring a slight tangential collision is optimal but at the cost of stability.
3.6 Predictions for <U+270F>t in experiments
A main finding of our analyses is the importance of minimizing tangential collisions with the ground
when running on rough terrains. But measuring <U+270F>t on rough terrains is challenging because it needs
a well-defined point of contact under the foot, precise knowledge of the terrain’s slope in 3D at
that point, and measurement of the reaction force along that tangent. To facilitate comparisons
with experimental data, we consider an easier to measure correlate of <U+270F>t via the parameter <U+270F>ˆt that
is defined as
vx
<U+270F>ˆt = 1 , (5)
vx
where vx /vx is the fraction of the forward momentum of the runner lost due to the passive
collision. On perfectly flat terrain, <U+270F>t = <U+270F>ˆt .
In the Monte Carlo simulations, <U+270F>ˆt is characterized by a distribution that evolves with increasing
steps (Fig. 4a, supplement Fig. S6a). The dependence of <U+270F>ˆt on steps taken arises because the runner
is slowing down, and thus vx and consequently vx change from step-to-step. But, the mean of
ˆt appears to converge to a constant after just 3 steps for all values of <U+270F>tc (supplement Fig. S6b).
Importantly, mean <U+270F>ˆt increases linearly with <U+270F>tc (Fig. 4b) and is thus a reliable correlate of the true
tangential collision. However, <U+270F>ˆt has a reduced range; mean <U+270F>ˆt = 0.81 at <U+270F>tc = 0, and mean <U+270F>ˆt = 0.97
at <U+270F>tc = 1. The standard deviation of the distributions converges to a value between 0.05 and 0.1 by
approximately 10 steps for most values of <U+270F>tc except when <U+270F>tc ! 1 (Fig. 4a, supplement Fig. S6b).
13
For comparison, reported values of <U+270F>ˆt from experiments with human runners on flat and two rough
terrains are 0.94 ± 0.01 (mean ± standard deviation) identically [22]. These experimental data are
consistent with the prediction that optimal anticipatory runners should maintain <U+270F>tc = 1.

4 Linear stability analysis
For periodic dynamic systems, linear stability is defined as the response to small perturbations
in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit [15, 23, 24] and analyzed using Floquet theory [15, 25].
Floquet analysis for the stability of a periodic orbit defines a transverse cross-section to the orbit
and a discrete return map from initial conditions on the cross-section back to the same cross-
section after a complete period. The eigenvalues of the return map, called Floquet multipliers, are
independent of the chosen cross-section and govern the stability of the periodic solution to small
perturbations [25]. Here we consider the anticipatory runner and discuss the open-loop runner in
supplement S6 because the unstable modes of both variants are the same.
The mechanical state of the runner is represented by <U+21E3> = (x, y, , vx , vy , !)T , where (x, y) and
denote the center of mass position and orientation, and (vx , vy ) and ! are the respective velocities,
all measured in a Newtonian reference frame that translates forward at a constant speed vx0 . A
steady runner is periodic in this translating Newtonian frame of reference. We define a transverse
cross-section (Poincare´ section) at the apex of the aerial phase (vy = 0) following the approach of
Full et al. [23] and Seyfarth et al. [16]. The equations (1) yield the step-to-step return map f an
14
and its linearization Tan in terms of the mechanical state in a translating frame according to

The Poincare´ map given by equation (6b) has a fixed point at = 0 when the terrain is flat and
corresponds to an exactly periodic runner on flat ground.
Figure 5: Illustration of the trajectory of the runner in state space in a reference frame that is
translating along with the runner with velocity vx0 . The runner appears periodic in this reference
frame and the runner’s mechanical state follows a periodic orbit. The return map f• (• is ‘ol’ or
‘an’ for open-loop or anticipatory, respectively) is defined from the apex of the aerial phase (vy = 0)
to apex of the following aerial phase. <U+21E4> is the fixed point of the return map and n is a small
perturbation away from the fixed point <U+21E4> at step n. In the next step, n maps to n+1 at the
apex of the following aerial phase under action of the return map f • .
The linearized return map Tan has three eigenvalues equal to one and the others are all less than
one. The eigenvalues with magnitude less than one correspond to stable modes so that perturbations
along their respective eigenvectors will always decay. The remaining three eigenvalues are all
15
= 1 with algebraic multiplicity equal to 3 and geometric multiplicity equal to 2. This implies
that there are only two independent eigenvectors corresponding to the three unity eigenvalues
and the matrix T an is therefore non-diagonalizable. For non-diagonalizable systems, the Jordan
decomposition is used to analyze stability in terms of generalized eigenvectors (supplement S6),
and implies that the modes (eigenvectors) associated with these eigenvalues cannot be decoupled
and analyzed independently.
The two eigenvectors <U+232B> 1 , <U+232B> 2 and the third generalized eigenvector <U+232B> 3 corresponding to the
repeat eigenvalue = 1 span a subspace in which the dynamics of the return map don’t do not
::::::
simply decay back to the origin. For a diagonalizable system, any perturbation within this subspace
would neither decay nor grow. However, the non-diagonalizable nature of T an leads to the outcome
that a perturbation 0 within this subspace grows with increasing steps. The eigenvectors <U+232B> 1 ,
<U+232B> 2 , <U+232B> 3 , the initial perturbation 0, and its growth after n steps to n are given by,

Only a perturbation of magnitude <U+21B5>3 along <U+232B> 3 a<U+21B5>ects stability and leads to a nearly linear growth
within the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors <U+232B> 1 , <U+232B> 2 . Perturbations along <U+232B> 1 or <U+232B> 2 neither
grow nor decay because these represent invariance with respect to rotations and translations of
the reference frame, respectively. A perturbation along the generalized eigenvector <U+232B> 3 may be
geometrically viewed as one that conserves the velocity of the contact point on flat terrain but
16
changes the angular momentum of the runner about its center of mass. Therefore, any perturbation
to the angular momentum will a<U+21B5>ect both orientation and forward speed.
For the special case of the anticipatory runner that completely avoids tangential collisions, the
linearized return map T an with <U+270F>tc = 1 has eigenvalue = 1 of algebraic multiplicity 4 and geometric
multiplicity 2, and one eigenvalue with | | < 1. The eigenvectors <U+232B> 1 , <U+232B> 2 and the generalized
eigenvectors <U+232B> 3 , <U+232B> 4 associated with = 1 form a basis for a subspace within which an initial

A perturbation to angular velocity ! causes a linear growth in orientation , and a perturbation to
the linear velocity vx causes a linear growth in position x. However, an anticipatory runner with
<U+270F>tc = 1 avoids angular velocity perturbations due to the terrain altogether, i.e. <U+21B5>3 = 0. Therefore,
only forward speed is a<U+21B5>ected due to the remaining unstable mode <U+232B> 4 .
Although there are no unstable eigenvalues with magnitude greater than one, we find that
the dynamics of running lead to an unstable growth with increasing steps. The growth due to
non-diagonalizability of the return map is linearly proportional to the number of steps, and not
geometric as is the case for simple unstable eigenvalues. Importantly, the primary e<U+21B5>ect of the
17
instability is to a<U+21B5>ect the forward speed and orientation, consistent with the numerical simulations
that use finite perturbations and nonlinear dynamics. Also in agreement with the simulations, the
only instability is translational when <U+270F>tc = 1.
5 Scaling analysis of the orientational failure mode
The mean steps to failure depends on many parameters, but none of the parameters separately
predict the failure statistics (supplement Fig. S7). As most runners undergo orientational failures,
we investigated whether the amount of body rotation accumulated over a single step due to a
terrain slope perturbation would predict failure statistics.
If a runner with a periodic trajectory on flat ground encounters a sloped terrain of angle <U+2713>,
the orientation • at the next landing will no longer be vertical. This orientation • accumulated
over one step depends on the take-o<U+21B5> vertical velocity vy,• + via the aerial phase time 2v + , and
y,•
take-o<U+21B5> angular velocity !•+ , as •
+ ! + . The subscript ‘•’ is a placeholder for ‘ol’ or ‘an’
= 2vy,• •
as the orientation change depends on whether the runner is purely open-loop (ol) or employs
anticipatory (an) control. We hypothesize that the mean steps to failure N• is a function of
the orientational threshold tol and the orientation change over a single step • alone, i.e. N• =
s• ( tol , • ). Substituting the form of s• ( tol , •) derived in supplement S8, we show that the mean
steps to failure N• is predicted to scale according to,
tol
N• <U+21E0> , (10)
•
where the expression for • is given in supplement equation S15e.
The mean steps to failure in simulations performed with many di<U+21B5>erent parameter values (sup-
plement S7) are well-approximated by a single function of a dimensionless parameter tol / •
(Fig. 6). The collapse of the simulation data highlights that the spin accumulated in one step
due to a single perturbation (equation (10)) captures the fundamental principle underlying orien-
tational failures. Importantly, this dimensionless parameter collapses the simulation data better
than any individual parameter (supplement Fig. S7). Thus, the single parameter tol / • quantifies
stability of runners of di<U+21B5>erent sizes and mass distributions.
The dimensionless parameter tol / • also captures the parametric dependence of mean steps to

For the open-loop strategy, neither of the collision parameters, <U+270F>n or <U+270F>tc , appear in the linear (leading
order) term. When using an anticipatory strategy, the tangential collision parameter <U+270F>tc appears
to leading order. The normal collision parameter <U+270F>n a<U+21B5>ects the second order dependence on <U+2713> for
both strategies. These show why it is impossible to avoid orientational failures for the open-loop
strategy, but may be avoided when using the anticipatory strategy by choosing <U+270F>tc = 1.
For the open-loop runner, tol / ol is independent of <U+270F>n and <U+270F>tc to first order in <U+2713> (equation (11a)).
Hence the contours in Fig. 7a (which resemble the contours in Fig. 2d from the Monte Carlo simu-
lations) show a weak dependence on <U+270F>n and <U+270F>tc that arises from the <U+2713>2 term in equation (11a). The
parameter ol is smallest when <U+270F>n = <U+270F>tc = 0, and largest when <U+270F>n = <U+270F>tc = 1. For a human-like run-
ner, I/G <U+2327> 1 (table 1), and thus the <U+2713>2 term in equation (11a) can be reduced to (3 + 2<U+270F>n )vx0 vy0 <U+2713>2 ,
with no dependence on <U+270F>tc at the asymptotic limit of I/G <U+2327> 1. The asymptotic analysis of ol

Figure 7: Contour plots of a, tol / ol and b, tol / an as a function of <U+270F>n and <U+270F>tc reveal that a single
parameter captures the dependence of mean steps to failure of both open-loop runners (Fig. 2d)
and anticipatory runners (Fig. 3a) on the collision parameters <U+270F>n and <U+270F>tc . Recall that the only
controllable parameters for the runners in these simulations are <U+270F>n and <U+270F>tc . The complete expression
for • , shown in supplement equation S15e, was used to generate these plots with parameter values
drawn from table 1, and tol = 1. For the anticipatory runner, we restricted the maximum value of
<U+270F>tc to 0.99. For higher values of <U+270F>tc , orientational failures do not dominate and thus mean failure
statistics are not accounted for by tol / • .
therefore explains why the contours of mean steps to failure in the Monte Carlo simulations are
nearly parallel to the <U+270F>tc axis and increase only slightly when <U+270F>n is decreased (Fig. 2d).
For the anticipatory runner, the first order term in the expansion depends on <U+270F>tc (equation 11b),
unlike the case for the open-loop runner (equation (11a)). Nearly perfect anticipation corresponds
to <U+270F>tc ! 1. At this limit an ! 0 and thus N = tol / an ! 1, explaining why the contours of mean
steps to failure in the Monte Carlo simulations are tightly bunched together in the neighborhood
of <U+270F>tc = 1 (Fig. 3a) and nearly parallel to the <U+270F>n axis. Like for the open-loop runner, an also shows
a dependence on <U+270F>n only in the pre-factor to the <U+2713>2 term of the series expansion in equation (11b).
As <U+270F>n decreases so does an , and thus tol / an increases, capturing the trend observed in the Monte
Carlo simulations where decreasing <U+270F>n increases steps taken for the anticipatory runner (Fig. 3a).
For the anticipatory runner, unlike the open-loop runner, the <U+270F>n dependence is coupled to <U+270F>tc , and
thus the sensitivity of the parameter tol / • to changes in <U+270F>n depend on the value of <U+270F>tc . The limit
of <U+270F>tc = 0, where an = ol has already been discussed above, for the open-loop runner. To analyze
the case where <U+270F>tc ! 1, we approximate an in the limit where I/G <U+2327> 1 (e.g. human-like runners)
as
2
an <U+21E1> 2vy0 (1 <U+270F>tc )<U+2713> + (1 <U+270F>tc )(2<U+270F>n + 3)vx0 vy0 <U+2713>2 . (12)
To understand the dependence of the mean steps to failure N on <U+270F>n and <U+270F>tc , we consider the
limit of small angles of the terrain slope <U+2713> <U+2327> 1. Using equation (12), and for small <U+2713> we find that
20
mean steps to failure N = tol / an and its sensitivity to changes in <U+270F>n are given by
<U+2713> <U+25C6>

N = (2vy0 3vx0 <U+2713> 2vx0 <U+2713><U+270F>n ), (13a)

<U+2713> <U+25C6>
@N 1 2 tol vx0
= . (13b)
@<U+270F>n 1 <U+270F>tc vy0
Therefore, N is more sensitive to changes in <U+270F>n when <U+270F>tc ! 1. This resembles Fig. 3a where the
mean steps to failure from the Monte Carlo simulations increases significantly as <U+270F>n is reduced when
<U+270F>tc ! 1, as opposed to when <U+270F>tc ! 0 where there is much lesser sensitivity of the mean steps to
failure with respect to changes in <U+270F>n .
Improving running stability by increasing mean steps to failure helps provide more time for
feedback driven corrections in real-world runners. The analysis of mean-steps to failure in the
simplified runners without any feedback ability suggests that increasing tol and decreasing • are
both e<U+21B5>ective strategies to negotiate rough terrains. Therefore, besides altering <U+270F>tc and <U+270F>n in order
to increase tol / • as already discussed, increasing I/G and reducing vy0 also improves stability.
6 Discussion
We show that purely open-loop strategies with no feedback control cannot stabilize sagittal-plane
dynamics during running. Such open-loop runners fail primarily by losing orientational stability

eliminate tangential collisions with the ground eliminates orientational instabilities but leads to a
steady slowing down of the runner. However, on a step-like piecewise flat terrain the open strategy is
sufficient to stabilize the runner without losing forward speed, and so is the anticipatory strategy.
If an anticipatory strategy is implemented noisily, i.e. the tangential collisions are low but not
entirely eliminated, the runner su<U+21B5>ers orientational instabilities. However, both the orientational
and the translational instabilities are weak when using an anticipatory strategy and the growth
of the instability is only linearly proportional to the number of steps taken and not a higher
power. The exact number of steps to failure depend on many parameters including the inertial,
geometry, collision parameters and the thresholds in orientation and speed for failure. These large
set of parameters may be combined into a single dimensionless parameter that captures the failure
21
statistics, which can also guide the morphological design of stable runners.
Impulsive stance assumption
An impulsive stance phase implies that the stance impulse is defined, but not the detailed time
history of forces. Thus the model may be used study the dynamics and stability over multiple steps,
but it cannot be used to find the actuation patterns that would achieve the desired impulse. Such
simplified models may be used to specify the desired collisional and push-o<U+21B5> impulses as constraints
that should be met. More detailed models could then be used to calculate the stance force profiles
as a constrained search or optimization problem.
The model also ignores the impulse due to the finite forces of gravity, because stance is treated
as instantaneous. Relaxing the assumption of instantaneous stance implies that body-weight a<U+21B5>ects
the body’s angular momentum about the contact point according to,
TZ
stance
+
H/P H/P = M/P (t) dt, (14)
0
where Tstance is the stance duration and M/P (t) is the time-varying moment of the body weight about
the contact point P. The torque due to gravitational forces about the contact point is proportional to
body weight and the time-varying horizontal distance from the center of mass to the contact point.
The gravitational contribution is zero for a symmetric stance, and highest for the most asymmetric
stance. Assuming a constant forward speed during stance and a 20 touchdown angle, the maximum
change in angular momentum about the contact point, i.e. the integral in equation (14), is | H/P | /
0.15 in the same dimensionless units as before. For a typical human runner, the resultant orientation
change in a single step is / 0.01, negligibly small compared to the influence of the terrain. Thus,
ignoring torques induced by gravity has minimal impact on our conclusions.
A finite stance duration and the associated change in configuration allows a runner to control
the body’s sagittal plane angular momentum independently from the forward and upward linear
momenta. This may be understood in terms of breaking the symmetry of the stance phase or
applying a large forward impulse and yet having the net ground reaction impulse pass through the
center of mass (no contribution to angular momentum). To not lose such control when considering
an impulsive stance, we permit the application of an arbitrary angular impulse J at the center

Figure 8: Equivalence between a runner using a finite stance with internal degrees of freedom
versus an infinitesimal stance with an applied torque impulse. The contact of the general runner is
represented as an impulse due to the collision at touchdown (left, pink vector) plus a net impulse
due to the push-o<U+21B5> (right, pink vector). In this example, by varying duration of stance, the runner
can selectively vary the lever arm of the push-o<U+21B5> impulse and thus the angular impulse about its
center of mass without altering the linear impulse. The net e<U+21B5>ect of a finite stance and change in
configuration is therefore captured in our model (right column) by a linear impulse at the point of
contact (pink vector at ground) and an angular impulse at the center of mass (J ).
of mass during push-o<U+21B5> (equation (1c)). Thus having a finite stance duration and change of body
configuration over stance is equivalent to J (Fig. 8). The angular impulse also provides a means to
accommodate torques due to a finite base of support and a moving center of pressure during stance.
However, recall that the constraint that the applied active push-o<U+21B5> impulses should lead to perfectly
periodic gait on flat terrain implies that J = 0. In our model, both open-loop and anticipatory
runners slow down on rough terrain. Regaining forward speed needs a feedback controller, and then
23
the additional control authority o<U+21B5>ered by J would be necessary to vary forward speed without
a<U+21B5>ecting the body’s angular momentum or vertical momentum.
Point contact assumption
Another limitation arises from considering a point-like contact that cannot capture e<U+21B5>ects associated
with the spatial extent of the foot. These e<U+21B5>ects include the spatial filtering of terrain roughness
and the application of a net torque about the initial contact point. The inclusion of J in the model
captures the application of torques, but there is no explicit means of incorporating the ability of
the foot to act as a spatial filter [26]. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the spatial
frequency (wave number) of the roughness of the terrain when using a model with a point contact.
Timescale for feedback corrections
Open-loop runners with human-like parameters have a 99% chance of taking at least 3 steps without
failing by exceeding the orientation threshold, while anticipatory runners (<U+270F>tc = 1) can take upto
15 steps with the same probability of completely losing forward momentum. This implies that the
open-loop runner employing the slowest sensory modality (visual feedback delay <U+21E1> 200 ms [18])
has 7 feedback cycles to correct for instabilities at endurance running speeds of 3m/s (step period
<U+21E1> 500 ms [17]), with only an approximately 1% chance of an orientational failure. Thus, while
sensory feedback is required to run on rough terrains, timescales associated with sensory feedback
delays do not limit the runner’s ability to maintain stability because of the slow-growing nature of
the instability. Furthermore, employing an appropriate anticipatory strategy (<U+270F>tc = 1) eliminates
the orientational instability entirely, thereby further extending the timescale over which feedback
is necessary.

Leg retraction
Analyses of running models with leg mass suggest that optimal retraction rate is defined by stability
demands, although these studies were limited to step-like terrains [7]. Experiments with runners on
flat ground which measure the angle of the foot’s velocity vector with respect to the ground suggest
that foot velocity is perhaps not modulated in the manner we hypothesize [28]. In the study by
Blum et al. [28], the mean angle made by the subjects’ foot velocity vector with the ground was
165 , whereas our prediction based on zero tangential speed of the foot at touchdown would imply
that the angle should be 90 . Given these di<U+21B5>erences, we propose that the low values of <U+270F>ˆt for human
runners observed by Dhawale and Venkadesan [22] may result from joint sti<U+21B5>ness modulation in
the leg rather than precise control of the foot speed through leg retraction. Modulating foot and
leg sti<U+21B5>ness allows the runner to minimize the tangential collision and yet employ leg retraction
strategies that accomplish other goals such as hypothesized by Seyfarth et al. [16] and Birn-Je<U+21B5>ery
et al. [29].
Energy dissipation
Besides leg retraction, energy dissipation may also aid in stability based on studies of walking
[30, 31] and running [1, 32, 37][1, 32]. Our model shows that while increasing energy dissipation
::::::
in the direction normal to the terrain does increase the number of steps taken for open-loop and
anticipatory runners, dissipating energy in the tangential collision is detrimental to stability. How-
ever, whether energy dissipation helps or hinders depends on the details of what is meant by
“open-loop”. For example if the runner uses a lab-fixed push-o<U+21B5> policy instead of the terrain-fixed
push-o<U+21B5> described in the main text, dissipating energy in the normal direction is also detrimen-
tal to orientational stability (supplement S10). Thus the hypothesized trade-o<U+21B5> between energy
consumption and stability is not universally true in our models. Our results are consistent with
experiments on running birds encountering sudden terrain drops, as the birds do not always dissi-
pate energy on the perturbation step [1]. Our results might provide a means to understand why
the increase in energy consumption for humans running on step-like terrains is only 5% [4]. We
25
find that open-loop strategies are sufficient to maintain stability on step-like terrains and additional
energy expenditure provides little added benefit.
Implications of scaling analysis to body plan of animals
The single parameter tol / • that predicts mean steps to failure (Fig. 6) generalizes our results
beyond runners with human-like parameters and morphology, and thus can be used as a criteria to
:::::::::::::::::::::
assess a runner’s stability. This is because runners with a larger tol / • should be able to maintain
orientation for a greater number of steps in the absence of sensory feedback control. We have
discussed how energy storage in the direction normal to the terrain (<U+270F>n ) and tangential collision
modulation (<U+270F>tc ) a<U+21B5>ects tol / • in section 5, and now turn to the implications the parameter has
on how body morphology and mass distribution a<U+21B5>ect stability.
The parameter tol is the maximum angle of tilt the runner can accumulate before it falls. By
employing Animals that posses larger (base/height) ratios, i.e. adopting have

and may also lead to potentially injurious collisions. Alternatively, light legs with a bulky, extended

reducing •. Anticipatory runners further benefit from setting <U+270F>t <U+21E1> 1 like observed in humans
[22], thereby drastically reducing • as discussed in section 5. Thus, the dimensionless parameter
tol / • is qualitatively consistent with the body morphology of adept and poor animal runners and
we propose that it can be used as a design criteria for running robots.
7 Notation
Scalars are denoted by italic symbols (e.g. m for mass of the runner, I for the moment of inertia),
vectors by bold, italic symbols (J imp for push-o<U+21B5> impulse, v for velocity), points or landmarks in
capitalized non-italic symbols (such as center of mass G in Fig. 1) and capitalized, bold, non-italic
symbols for matrices (such as return map matrix Tan ). Vectors associated with a point, such
as velocity of center of mass G are written as v G , with the uppercase alphabet in the subscript
specifying the point in the plane. Angular momentum vectors or moment of inertia variables are
subscripted with ‘/A’ representing angular momentum or moment of inertia computed about point
A, such as I/G representing moment of inertia about center of mass G. The x^ component of the
velocity vector of point A v A is denoted with a subscript ‘A,x’, e.g. tangential velocity of the contact
point P is written as vP,t . The symbols vx0 , vy0 denote the initial forward and vertical velocities of
the runner at take-o<U+21B5>. Variables just before collision with the terrain are denoted by the superscript
‘-’, after passive collision but before push-o<U+21B5> by the superscript ‘c’, and just after push-o<U+21B5> by the
superscript ‘+’. For example, angular velocity before collision is ! , after passive collision is ! c
and just after push-o<U+21B5> is ! + .
