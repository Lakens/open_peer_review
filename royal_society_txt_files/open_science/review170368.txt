This is well written, comprehensive, logically organized, and contains valuable information on
the surface-tailoring potential of Tiron and Chromotropic acid for nano-TiO2 in the mixed-matrix
membranes for antifouling applications. The authors did an excellent job in the preparation of the
facile functionalization of nanoparticles of anatase TiO2 (nano-TiO2) by using two different
organoligands, viz. Tiron and Chromotropic acid, which was carried out to obtain
organofunctionalized nanoadditives, FT-nano-TiO2 and FC-nano-TiO2, respectively. The authors
demonstrated that mixed-matrix membranes, amended by impregnating FT-nano-TiO2 and FC-
nano-TiO2, exhibited superior flux recovery ratios as compared to the control polysulfone as well
as the pristine nano-TiO2 blended membranes. The authors concluded that the prepared mixed-
matrix membranes lead to an energy-efficient and environmental-friendly ultrafiltration process
having diverse industrial perspectives, especially for applications related to wastewater
treatment. However, the authors may have overlooked articles related to the amphiphilic
macromolecules, called as surface modifying macromolecules for anti-fouling applications of
various separation membranes. Therefore, it is worth mentioning the anti-biofouling polymeric
film preparation since it is yet another approach. Surface modifying macromolecules used as
additives in the polymeric films were discussed in detail in these articles as mentioned below:

thors herein have made an attempt to functionalize nanoparticles of anatase TiO2 (nano-TiO2) by
wo different organoligands, viz. Tiron and Chromotropic acid, to obtain the organofunctionalized
ditives, FT-nano-TiO2 and FC-nano-TiO2, respectively. We believe such target-specific facile
ches devoted to amend the physicochemical features and surface chemistry of the pristine
ditive, herein the nano-TiO2 potentially lead to the development of chemically-embroidered
uctured material with properties above and beyond the conventional nanomaterials of similar
eported in literature. The authors have further demonstrated that mixed-matrix membranes,
ed by impregnating FT-nano-TiO2 and FC-nano-TiO2, exhibited superior flux recovery ratios as
ed to the control polysulfone as well as the pristine nano-TiO2 blended membranes. The outcome
present study has thus got more promises in providing stable and effective anti-fouling
eristics to the membrane surface than the virgin nano-TiO2. It has also been concluded that these
matrix membranes can lead to an energy-efficient and environmental-friendly ultrafiltration
, which has got diverse and potential industrial perspectives. Thus, we believe the study can
unique and significant contribution to the area of mixed-matrix membranes.
