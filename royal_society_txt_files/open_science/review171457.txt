The present manuscript was focused synthesis and characterization of ZnO with different
morphologies by simple precipitation method. In addition, the synthesized sample was
categorized by different techniques like XRD, SEM and DRS. Further the prepared materials were
engaged to the removal of sulfamethazine
In my opinion, the paper was well established and explained in a clear manner. But the
characterization part author should concentrate more. Furthermore, major corrections are to be
carried out before the acceptance of the paper.
Reviewer comments:
In the introduction section, unnecessary to explain the basic mechanism of photocatalyst [Page
No: 2, line no: 47-57 and Page no;3-line No: 1-10] should remove. Instead of that, author should
explain more about morphological advantage of ZnO and other oxides from previous reports, the
following journal should help to explain advantage of morphology.

label_comment_2
The manuscript described the application three types of ZnO as catalysts to photo-degrade the
antibiotics of sulfamethazine (SMN). Effects of morphologies of ZnO catalysts on the degradation
efficiency and intermediates of SMN were examined. This study is interesting; however, some
key points should be clearly clarified or addressed by the authors to make the manuscript
publishable. (1) SMN is susceptive to self-photolysis and based on the experimental data, self-
photolysis of SMN contributes to 78% of SMN degradation within 1 h. ZnO only added 10-17%
SMN degradation at the same reaction time. The readers may question the necessity of adding
ZnO as catalysts if they recognize that a similar result can be reached with a prolonged reaction
time. Although the authors may argue that ZnO can degrade SMN more “complete” while
considering the differences in the TOC contents and the anion productions. Nonetheless, if the
intermediates of SMN are unharmful, I am wondering whether complete mineralization of SMN
can be a conceivable benefit of using ZnO? I suggest that the authors should justify the values of
applying ZnO for SMN degradation more clear in the text. (2) The solution pH controls greatly
the photolysis of SMN, particularly at high pH. When emphasizing the significance of ZnO, I
suggest that the authors may proceed the experiments in an acidic solution to eliminate the effect
of photolytic reaction of SMN. (3) The pathways of SMN degradations have been well-developed
in the literatures, and thus, the focus of the study should demonstrate the differences in the
degradation pathways of SMN using ZnO or other catalysts. Repetitive report of the known
information seems not helping improve the scientific knowledge of the photo-degradation of
SMN. My other comments are pending below:
(1) The light intensity (or quantum yield) associated with the emitted wavelengths of the light
source should be provided.
(2) As mentioned by the authors in the introduction, the crystallinity, surface areas, and
morphology of ZnO can affect its photo-reactivity to various organic pollutants. These factors
should also be considered in the current study. Why did the authors emphasize only the
morphology of ZnO as the key factor in controlling SMN degradation?
(3) The experimental processes of photo-reactions seem to be over-simplified. The solution pH,
the pore-size/texture of filters, and the detail procedures of sample extraction during the photo-
reactions are suggested to be provided.
4
(4) I strongly suggest that the authors should provide a table showing the efficiency of SMN
degradation using different catalysts (from the literatures and the current study) to show that the
ZnO can be a potential substitute of other catalysts for SMN degradation.
(5) Because the authors did not duplicate their experiments, I suggest that the stoichiometric
calculations of ratios for the consumptions of reactants and the formation of products in the end
of the experiments should be done to compare the theoretical values and ensure the quality of the
experimental data.
(6) Each diffraction peak in the XRD diagram should mark the angle and crystal planes.
(7) On page, 8, line 54, an error symbol showing in the text. Please check the validity of listed
reference.
(8) The unit for the bar in the Fig. 1 (a) is missing.

Each of my comments had been answered. I have a minor suggestion for the authors. Although
the authors mentioned that the intensity of light source was inaccessible due to the lack of
measurement instruments, I still encourage the authors to obtain the intensity data and major
emitted wavelengths of the light from either manufacturer or published paper. These parameters
influence greatly the photolytic efficiencies of antibiotics, the photo-products of antibiotics, or
even the photocatalytic performances of ZnO with different morphologies.

Responses to the comments of Reviewer #1
In the introduction section, unnecessary to explain the basic mechanism of
photocatalyst [Page No: 2, line no: 47-57 and Page no;3-line No: 1-10] should remove.
Instead of that, author should explain more about morphological advantage of ZnO and
other oxides from previous reports, the following journal should help to explain
advantage of morphology.

Response:
The “Introduction” has been revised according to the reviewers’ comments.
The author should include wavelength of irradiation light.
Response:
The irradiation light was 300 W high press Hg light, 365 nm UV light emitted
predominantly. The data of wavelength of light has noted in section 2.3 of manuscript.
In the XRD; author should include more details especially JCPDS NO, lattice
parameters, crystallite size, hkl value and etc.,
Response:
We noted the JCPDS No. in the second paragraph of section 3.1. BET surface area,
lattice parameters, average crystallite size were listed in table 1. The angle and crystal
planes were marked on the XRD diagram.
In the DRS; author should bandgap by KM function?
Response:
The bandgap was estimated by plots of (Ah<U+03C5>)2 versus h<U+03C5>, and the plot was inserted in
Fig.4.
The SEM image; author should check scale for every image? it is possible 10?????
Response:
The SEM image were got at different magnification respectively. The size of the
corresponding scale has been marked in the Fig.2.
The pathway diagram is necessary for the photocatalyst, so author should include
mechanism.
Response:
In our work, the solution obtained after SMN degradation for 30 min using T-ZnO, was
purposely used to detect as many intermediate as possible via LC-MS/MS
measurements. The pathway of SMN photocatalytic reaction was proposed. But, we
did not test the change of active radical with producing of the intermediates during the
photocatalytic reaction, so we cannot describe the mechanism. We plan to do it in the
future work.

Responses to the comments of Reviewer #2
(1) SMN is susceptive to self-photolysis and based on the experimental data, self-
photolysis of SMN contributes to 78% of SMN degradation within 1 h. ZnO only
added 10-17% SMN degradation at the same reaction time. The readers may
question the necessity of adding ZnO as catalysts if they recognize that a similar
result can be reached with a prolonged reaction time. Although the authors may
argue that ZnO can degrade SMN more “complete” while considering the
differences in the TOC contents and the anion productions. Nonetheless, if the
intermediates of SMN are unharmful, I am wondering whether complete
mineralization of SMN can be a conceivable benefit of using ZnO? I suggest that
the authors should justify the values of applying ZnO for SMN degradation more
clear in the text.
Response:
The complementary argument of the necessity of studying the “complete mineralization
of SMN using ZnO ” has been added in section 3.3. As mentioned in many researches,
most of the organic carbon were still retained although the photolysis of antibiotics
under UV was effective. The studies on antibacterial activity and toxicity of the
intermediates produced by photolysis of sulfonamides, fluoroquinolone, tetracycline,
et al. indicated that the mixed byproducts showed an increasing toxicity, and the
solutions after photolysis still had certain residual antibacterial activity. Furthermore,
the complete decomposition of organic contaminant to inorganic molecules is the main
purpose in wastewater treatment. Under various experimental conditions, the
destruction of organic compounds was different. Based on these, the efficiency of ZnO
samples with different morphologies for SMN mineralization evaluated in this study is
necessary.
(2) The solution pH controls greatly the photolysis of SMN, particularly at high pH.
When emphasizing the significance of ZnO, I suggest that the authors may proceed
the experiments in an acidic solution to eliminate the effect of photolytic reaction
of SMN.
Response:
In this work, we were focused on comparing photocatalytic activity of the different ZnO.
Many researches have proved that ZnO photo-corrosion was inevitable under acidic or
alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the impact of photolysis of SMN on photocatalytic
activity of different ZnO is similar. Based on these, we set the solution pH at 7, did not
proceed the experiments in an acidic solution.
(3) The pathways of SMN degradations have been well-developed in the literatures,
and thus, the focus of the study should demonstrate the differences in the
degradation pathways of SMN using ZnO or other catalysts.
Response:
As you said, the pathways of SMN degradations have been well-developed in the
literatures. We were focused on comparing photocatalytic activity of the different
ZnO for SMN, and try to find out the differences in the degradation pathways of SMN
using ZnO. So we measured the intermediates in the reaction process. Although, the
significant differences has not been found, we think the work of “section 3.4” is
necessary for the completeness of this study, and will lay a better theoretical foundation
for the development and application of the photocatalytic technology in the field of
antibiotics treatment.
The other comments are pending below:
(1) The light intensity (or quantum yield) associated with the emitted wavelengths of
the light source should be provided.
Response:
In this work, we compared photocatalytic activity of the different ZnO under same light
source. We did not discuss the effect of the light intensity. Sorry, we have no instruments
to measure the light intensity currently. Just like what you said, the light intensity (or
quantum yield) associated with the light source is very important for photocatalysis. In
a follow-up study, we plan to buy the instrument and study the impact of light intensity
and the energy consumption on photocatalytic performance. We hope it would not affect
the presentation of the results of this paper without the data of the light intensity.
(2) As mentioned by the authors in the introduction, the crystallinity, surface areas, and
morphology of ZnO can affect its photo-reactivity to various organic pollutants. These
factors should also be considered in the current study. Why did the authors emphasize
only the morphology of ZnO as the key factor in controlling SMN degradation?
Response:
The crystallinity, surface areas, size of three ZnO used in this study were listed in Table
1. Meanwhile, the ZnOs used in this work had obviously different morphology. Many
literatures demonstrated the impact of crystallinity, surface areas, size of photocatalyst
with similar shapes on their photocatalytic activity. In our work, when we used different
morphology of ZnO, the rules of influence are quite different. We thought it was caused
by different morphology. So we emphasize the morphology as the key factor in
controlling SMN degradation using ZnO.
(3) The experimental processes of photo-reactions seem to be over-simplified. The
solution pH, the pore-size/texture of filters, and the detail procedures of sample
extraction during the photo-reactions are suggested to be provided.
Response:
The supplementary instruction of the experimental process has been added in section
2.3.
(4) I strongly suggest that the authors should provide a table showing the efficiency of
SMN degradation using different catalysts (from the literatures and the current study)
to show that the ZnO can be a potential substitute of other catalysts for SMN
degradation.
Response:
In the “Introduction”, we reviewed many literatures, some of them has proved that ZnO
could be a potential substitute of other catalysts for many organic matter photocatalytic
degradation. On account of ZnO with different shapes can be produced by different
methods, we selected three ZnO to compared their photocatalytic activity for SMN, and
discussed the effect of different ZnO on their photocatalytic activity for SMN. Because
we could not find the literatures on other catalysts for SMN degradation, which
performed under same conditions as ours. We think it is not rigorous to compare the
activity of different photocatalyst under different reaction conditions.
(5) Because the authors did not duplicate their experiments, I suggest that the
stoichiometric calculations of ratios for the consumptions of reactants and the formation
of products in the end of the experiments should be done to compare the theoretical
values and ensure the quality of the experimental data.
Response:
All the experiments were performed in triplicate in this work. We just took the average
of the data for analysis. Now, we analyzed the data again, the error analysis of data
from three replicated experiments has been done, and all the figures have been modified.
(6) Each diffraction peak in the XRD diagram should mark the angle and crystal planes.
Response:
The XRD diagram has been corrected.
(7) On page, 8, line 54, an error symbol showing in the text. Please check the validity
of listed reference.
Response:
We has checked and revised it.
(8) The unit for the bar in the Fig. 1 (a) is missing.
Response:
The missing may be caused by the manuscript uploaded. We have corrected it.

Comments to the Author(s)
Each of my comments had been answered. I have a minor suggestion for the
authors. Although the authors mentioned that the intensity of light source was
inaccessible due to the lack of measurement instruments, I still encourage the
authors to obtain the intensity data and major emitted wavelengths of the light
from either manufacturer or published paper. These parameters influence
greatly the photolytic efficiencies of antibiotics, the photo-products of
antibiotics, or even the photocatalytic performances of ZnO with different
morphologies.
Response:
The service life of the light source, irradiation distance, power stability and other factors
can lead to different intensity of light source. I have read many paper, but did not find
the paper, which experimental conditions were same as our work. So, we cannot obtain
the intensity data from either manufacturer or published paper. The intensity data of
different experiment should be measured by UV intensity meter. Because we have no
instruments to measure the light intensity currently, we cannot get the intensity data in
this work.
In this study, our focus is to compared photocatalytic activity of the different ZnO under
same light source. We did not discuss the effect of the light intensity. We don’t think it
would affect the presentation of the results of this paper without the data of the light
intensity.
Just like what you said, the light intensity (or quantum yield) associated with the light
source is very important for photocatalysis. In a follow-up study, we plan to buy the
instrument and study the impact of light intensity and the energy consumption on
photocatalytic performance.
The major emitted wavelengths of the light were added in Section 2.3.
