Dear Author(s)
Ref: Submission Optimization of sand-casting process parameters and missing data prediction
Thank you for submitting your work to the International Journal of Royal Society Open Science:.
We regretfully conclude that sentences in this paper seem to have been borrowed from other
published articles.
We do thank you for your interest in the International Journal of Royal Society Open Science.
There are the some points, which are to be taken care of.
1. On Page No. 2 line No. 25-28: is a contradictory statement, how can data be missed and would
lead to waste of resources.
2. Some of the statement in “Introduction” are not relevant e.g. line No. 31-40 etc. on Page 2.
3. No source is given for all the formulas.
4. Most of the Abbreviations are not defined.
5. After giving a small description of methods, jumped to results. No problem formulation is
given
6. There is no range given for the process parameters for optimization.
7. On Page 10 line No 18, GP, GCS “positive indicator” and for MC “negative indicator” on which
base, how it is being decided. Line No. 21-23 self contradictory.
8. Figure No. 4 is not explained.
9. Model is not formulated.
10. Conclusion is not self explanatory.
11. Some of the references are not referred at all in the text and some are not even relevant to
topic itself.

To optimize the process parameters in sand casting, a method based on gray relational analysis is
presented and BP neural network is used to predict missing data in this paper.
I have the following major concerns regarding this paper.
1. There are a lot of issues on the language expression, some sentence patterns are not used
correctly.
2. The relationship between parameters optimization and data missing prediction can’t be found.
It seems the two key points proposed in this paper are fragmented.
3. Both gray relational analysis and BP neural network are quite conventional methods. This
paper devotes much space (about 7 pages) describing the basic principle of common methods,
and there is little improvement.
4. From my point of view, BP neural network is a simple but not an effective method for missing
data prediction in this paper. In fact, people are not interested in the process of network training
and its parameter selection. It’s meaningless for common methods like BP NN. What is the
advantage of the method proposed in this paper? There should be more comparison between
different missing data predictions.
5. In chapter 4. Discussion, there should be deeper analysis but not similar content like overview.

Reviewer: 1
Comment 1: On Page No. 2 line No. 25-28: is a contradictory statement, how can data be missed and
would lead to waste of resources.
Response: Thank you for the comments on the paper. It's our fault that wish to express as much
content as possible in one sentence, which caused a misunderstanding. The recorded parameters data
might be lost due to improper care, such as the tally book lost, or the storage data computer
breakdown. Remeasurement of the missing data needs a lot of money, manpower and time, which
would lead to a waste of resources. Therefore, those sentences are revised as follows:
In the sand casting process, a portion of the recorded parameters data might be lost due to improper
care, such as the tally book lost, or the storage data computer breakdown.
Remeasurement of the missing data needs a lot of money, manpower and time, which would lead to a
waste of resources. In addition, it is often difficult to find sand samples from the original casting batch
due to the continuous production. Therefore, it was important and necessary here to predict the missing
data based on existing data.
Comment 2: Some of the statement in “Introduction” are not relevant e.g. line No. 31-40 etc. on Page
2.
Response: Thank you for your instructive suggestions. Partial content on page 2 line 31-40 does not
have much relevance indeed, so we delete some content and revise those sentences by logic as follows:
The frequently used prediction techniques include BP neural network [27–29], gray system theory [30],
principal component analysis [31], support vector machine [32], and Monte Carlo methods [33]. Among
these prediction methods, BP neural network is a kind of nonlinear mathematical model that simulates
nonlinear process of any degree. The biggest advantage of this model is that it can be trained and tested
repeatedly, and finally it can approach any complicated nonlinear function. For example, Guo [29] has
proposed a hybrid wind speed-forecasting method based on BP neural network.
Comment 3: No source is given for all the formulas.
Response: Thank you very much to point out this question in our manuscript. We are sorry for this
mistake. The formulas sources are added in the Gray relational analysis section as follows:
The mean method was applied to nondimensionalize the evaluation indicators, shown in formula 1 [16].
(1)
After dimensionless, the original data matrix of evaluation indicators was transferred as follows.
and the ideal project be .
With dimensionless evaluation indicators, let the ideal project be the reference sequence and the
evaluation project be the sequence to be compared, in which case the gray relational coefficient of the
jth evaluation indicator of the ith evaluation project can be achieved according to formula 2 [18].
(2)
The significant difference between gray relational coefficients was increased and might result in data
distortion, which caused by the maximum absolute value being too large. To avoid this situation, the
resolution coefficient was introduced in formula 2, and usually set to .
Let the evaluation indicator weights of projects evaluated be , in which case the GRD of projects
evaluated was obtained according to formula 3 [17].
(3)
The larger the GRD , the closer the ith project evaluated was to the ideal project . Accordingly, the order
of the projects evaluated was confirmed.
The formulas sources are added in the Entropy weight method section as follows:
The procedure of the objective entropy weight method was presented below [22].
From the original data matrix Y, the data proportion was calculated based on formula 4.
(4)
The entropy of evaluation indicators was achieved according to formula 5.
(5)
The entropy weight of evaluation indicators was calculated based on formula 6.
(6)
From the calculating process, the smaller the entropy , the larger the variation in evaluation indicators,
the more information it provided, and the larger weight it should be given.
The formulas in the BP neural network section are mainly deduced by ourselves, therefore there is few
source in this part.
Comment 4: Most of the Abbreviations are not defined.
Response: Thank you for your valuable comments. The abbreviations that don't well known are defined
in the paper as follows:
Among these process parameters, VQ is the ability that gas to penetrate high molecular material under a
certain degree of pressure and time; WCS refers to the ability of object to resist external pressure under
the saturated water condition; MC is the percentage of water content to the total mass of the object;
Com is the proportion of the volume change of the object under a certain degree of pressure.
GRD refers to the relational degree between the project evaluated and the ideal project.
Comment 5: After giving a small description of methods, jumped to results. No problem formulation is
given
Response: Thank you for your careful reading of our manuscript. The problem formulation was added in
the Introduction section as follows.
When selecting the optimization sand casting process parameters, usually one parameter in batch A
reach the ideal value, and another parameter in batch B reach the ideal value, but not all the
parameters in one batch can reach the ideal value at the same time. Therefore, it's of great significance
to select the optimization process parameters in single batch. The common optimization method of sand
casting process parameters is Taguchi's method [12], but this method requires much experimentation
and increases costs, which is counter to its purpose of reducing costs. Therefore, it was necessary to find
a simple method for optimizing sand casting process parameters. A novel optimization method of
process parameters based on gray relational analysis was introduced here.
Once the optimization process parameters were achieved, sand casting should refer to that batch to
ensure safe casting and improve casting quality. But if some batches have data missing, they should be
deleted and can't be used for optimizing process parameters, which will have a bad influence on
optimizing process parameters. What's more, the optimization process parameters are less likely to be
achieved due to short of enough valid data. Remeasurement of the missing data needs a lot of money,
manpower and time, which would lead to a waste of resources. In addition, it is often difficult to find
sand samples from the original casting batch due to the continuous production. Therefore, it was
important and necessary here to predict the missing data based on existing data. In the sand casting
process, a portion of the recorded parameters data might be lost due to improper care, such as the tally
book lost, or the storage data computer breakdown. Here, BP neural network [29] was introduced to
predict missing data of sand casting. As there's few papers published refer to the basic principle of BP
neural network, therefore correlative theory of BP neural network was deduced to let readers have a
better understanding of this model.
Comment 6: There is no range given for the process parameters for optimization.
Response: Thank you for the comments on the paper. We are sorry for not describing the range for the
process parameters for optimization. There is interaction effect among these process parameters. With
increased compactability, the wet compressive strength of sand increased. After the compactability
reached a certain level, the wet compressive strength did not increase much. However, the venting
quality decreased rapidly with continued increased compactability. It needs more data support to give
the range for the process parameters for optimization. Therefore, we just select the optimization batch
22 based on the given data.
Comment 7: On Page 10 line No 18, GP, GCS “positive indicator” and for MC “negative indicator” on
which base, how it is being decided. Line No. 21-23 self contradictory.
Response: Thank you for your careful work. It's our fault that don't explanation clearly in the
manuscript. Therefore, we add corresponding content in the paper as follows.
Assuming that all parameters were within a reasonable range, meeting the normal production of sand
casting. The VQ and WCS are the larger the better assessment indicators, therefore they are positive
indicators. The MC is the smaller the better assessment indicator, so it's negative indicator. There is
interaction effect among these process parameters. Com refers to the volume change of green sand
under a certain degree of pressure. With increased Com, the WCS of sand increased. After the Com
reached a certain level, the WCS did not increase much. But, the VQ decreased rapidly with continued
increased Com. If the parameter Com was too large, the parameter VQ would be small; otherwise, if the
parameter Com was too small, the parameter WCS would also be small. Therefore, Com belonged to the
moderate indicator category, not too large or too small.
Comment 8: Figure No. 4 is not explained.
Response: Thank you for the comments on the paper. We have added the explanation about Figure No.
4 according to you suggestion as follows.
As was shown in Figure 4, the little circle refers to the actual fitting data, the blue line represents the
function relationship between target and output of training samples, and the imaginary line represents
the output was equal to the target. The function relationship between target and output of training
samples was shown in formula 33.
Output ˜ 0.967 * Target + 0.0033 (33)
The correlation coefficient of fitting function was R=0.98037. The output and target of the training
samples were basically equal (Fig. 4). But due to poor correspondence between the training samples,
the output and target of individual samples still had great error, which was consistent with the analysis
results (Fig. 3).
Comment 9: Model is not formulated.
Response: We are grateful for your suggestion. It's our fault that ignoring this part, therefore we add
one section Procedure for model formulated as follows.
Procedure for model formulated
The main procedure for this composite model formulated based on gray relational analysis and BP neural
network were as follows.
(1) Determining the weight of evaluation indicators. To avoid the influence of human factors, the weight
of evaluation indicators were determined by the objective entropy weight method, which also saved a lot
of manpower. The larger variation degree in the evaluation indicators, indicating that the evaluated
projects had good discrimination in this regard, and a larger weight should be given to these evaluation
indicators.
(2) Selecting the optimization process parameters of sand casting. The GRD can be achieved after the
weight of evaluation indicators were determined. The larger the GRD, the closer the evaluated project
was to the ideal project. Accordingly, the order of the evaluated projects was confirmed.
(3) Predicting the missing data of process parameters. Dividing the process parameters data into
training samples and prediction samples. Using the training samples for training BP neural network, then
predicting the missing data based on the trained BP neural network. This paper also provided a new
method for determining the number of hidden neurons in a network.
Comment 10: Conclusion is not self explanatory.
Response: Thank you for the comments on this paper. We have revised the Conclusion by logic as
follows.
A composite optimization and prediction model of sand casting process parameters was proposed based
on gray relational analysis and BP neural network. The main conclusions were as follows.
First, to avoid the influence of human factors, the weights of evaluation indicators were achieved based
on the objective entropy weight method and the results were 0.3812, 0.2231, 0.0594, and 0.3364 for
the VQ, WCS, MC, and Com, respectively. The weight of parameter VQ was the biggest, indicating that
the sand batch had good discrimination in this regard.
Second, the GRDs of foundry sand were obtained according to gray relational analysis after the weight of
process parameters were determined, and the results showed that sample batch 22 possessed the
largest GRD. Thus, it was advised that process parameters of sand castings refer to batch 22 to ensure
safety casting and improve casting quality.
Third, the process parameters data were divided into training samples and prediction samples. The
mean square error of training samples was the smallest when the number of hidden neurons was 9 and
the epoch 140 when training BP neural network, and the relative error of the prediction samples was
0.62% based on this trained BP neural network. The relevant theory was deduced before predicting
missing data, such that there will be a general understanding regarding the prediction principle of BP
neural network.
Fourth, to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of BP neural network adopted in the process of
missing data prediction, gray system theory was applied to compare the result of missing data
prediction. The relative error of predictive value was 2.64% based on gray system theory. The results
showed that the predictive value of BP neural network was more precision than gray system theory.
Comment 11: Some of the references are not referred at all in the text and some are not even relevant
to topic itself.
Response: Thank you for your instructive suggestions. We looked through the references carefully to
guarantee that all the references were referred in the text, and also we substituted some less relevant
references.

Reviewer: 2
Comment 1: There are a lot of issues on the language expression, some sentence patterns are not used
correctly.
Response: Thank you for your careful reading of our manuscript. We are very sorry for our language
mistakes in the paper. According to the comments from you, we polished the manuscript with a
professional assistance in writing.
Comment 2: The relationship between parameters optimization and data missing prediction can’t be
found. It seems the two key points proposed in this paper are fragmented.
Response: Thank you for your instructive suggestions. We add some transitional content to connect
these two parts as follows according to the comments from you.
Once the optimization process parameters were achieved, sand casting should refer to that batch to
ensure safe casting and improve casting quality. But if some batches have data missing, they should be
deleted and can't be used for optimizing process parameters, which will have a bad influence on
optimizing process parameters. What's more, the optimization process parameters are less likely to be
achieved due to short of enough valid data. Remeasurement of the missing data needs a lot of money,
manpower and time, which would lead to a waste of resources. In addition, it is often difficult to find
sand samples from the original casting batch due to the continuous production. Therefore, it was
important and necessary here to predict the missing data based on existing data. In the sand casting
process, a portion of the recorded parameters data might be lost due to improper care, such as the tally
book lost, or the storage data computer breakdown. Here, BP neural network [29] was introduced to
predict missing data of sand casting. As there's few papers published refer to the basic principle of BP
neural network, therefore correlative theory of BP neural network was deduced to let readers have a
better understanding of this model.
Comment 3: Both gray relational analysis and BP neural network are quite conventional methods. This
paper devotes much space (about 7 pages) describing the basic principle of common methods, and there
is little improvement.
Response: Thank you for the comments on this paper. We really agree with your viewpoints that gray
relational analysis and BP neural network are quite conventional methods. In practical application, we
usually get the results based on the procedure of model. But if we didn't know the basic principle of
model, we could not get the right results. In addition, if we ignored the basic principle of these model in
the paper, readers will be confused about how to get results. What's more, there is few papers published
in English refer to the basic principle of BP neural network, therefore correlative theory of the BP neural
network was deduced to let readers have a better understanding of this model. Also, this paper provided
a new method for determining the number of hidden neurons in a network according to the mean square
error of training samples.
Comment 4: From my point of view, BP neural network is a simple but not an effective method for
missing data prediction in this paper. In fact, people are not interested in the process of network training
and its parameter selection. It’s meaningless for common methods like BP NN. What is the advantage of
the method proposed in this paper? There should be more comparison between different missing data
predictions.
Response: Thank you for the comments on this paper. This paper provided a new method for
determining the number of hidden neurons in a network according to the mean square error of training
samples, therefore we should have a better understanding of the network training process. The
advantage of the method proposed were added in the paper as follows.
The advantages of the composite model proposed in this paper were as follows. First, optimization
process parameters can contribute to reducing foundry defects and improving casting quality as well as
ensuring safety in sand casting. Second, prediction of missing data can avoid repetitive waste of
resources and the difficulties of retesting. Third, this paper provided a new method for determining the
number of hidden neurons in a network according to the mean square error of training samples.
The added content of compare with gray system theory was as follow.
4.1 Compare with gray system theory
To demonstrate the validity and feasibility of BP neural network adopted in the process of missing data
prediction, this section compare the result of missing data prediction with GM(1,1) model. GM(1,1)
model is one basic and important part in the gray system theory, which refers to first order Gray Model
in one variable [20]. The brief procedure of GM(1,1) model was as follows [20].
Let the original data sequence be and the accumulation data sequence , where can be calculated based
on formula 34.
(34)
Suppose the matrix accord with exponential change law, and the whitenization equation of GM(1,1)
model is as follow.
(35)
Let be the initial conditions, solve the equation 35 and the predictive formula of can be achieved, shown
in 36.
(36)
The predictive formula of the original data sequence is shown in formula 37, calculated as .
(37)
The parameters a and b are based on the least squares estimate of GM(1,1) model, shown in formula
38.
(38)
where the matrix B and Y are as follow.
The background value is mean sequence of , calculated by formula 39.
(39)
Suppose VQ process parameters of the first 39 batches were the original data sequence, then the
predictive formula was shown in formula 40 based on the above procedures.
(40)
Therefore, the VQ predictive value of the 40th batch was 180.1235 according to formula 40, and the
relative error was 2.64%.
It can be seen that the predictive value of BP neural network was more precision than gray system
theory. It's mainly because that BP neural network takes advantage of more information, and BP neural
network is a kind of nonlinear mathematical model that can simulates nonlinear process of any degree.
The biggest advantage of this model is that it can be trained and tested repeatedly, and finally it can
approach any complicated nonlinear function.
Comment 5: In chapter 4. Discussion, there should be deeper analysis but not similar content like
overview.
Response: Thank you for your valuable advice. The Discussion was revised as follows.

4.2 Discussion of results
The present results confirmed that the composite model proposed in this paper was successfully applied
to sand casting. This was the first report in this field of the optimization of process parameters based on
gray relational analysis and predictions of missing data based on BP neural network. The advantages of
the composite model proposed in this paper were as follows. First, optimization process parameters can
contribute to reducing foundry defects and improving casting quality as well as ensuring safety in sand
casting. Second, prediction of missing data can avoid repetitive waste of resources and the difficulties of
retesting. Third, this paper provided a new method for determining the number of hidden neurons in a
network according to the mean square error of training samples.
Motivated by previous studies on gray relational analysis [15–17], this method was introduced into the
field of sand casting for process parameters optimizing for the first time in this paper. The larger the
GRD, the closer the project evaluated was to the ideal project. Accordingly, the order of the projects
evaluated was confirmed. The GRD of sample batch 22 was the largest, so sample batch 22 was the
optimization process parameters of sand casting. The results showed that gray relational analysis can be
easily used for process parameters optimizing of sand casting. Different from Taguchi's method [12],
which requires a lot of experimentations, gray relational analysis is less demanding on the quantity and
regularity of samples and can be easily calculated without any discrepancy between calculated results
and quantitative analysis results. In the process of determining assessment indicators weights, to
eliminate the influence of human factors, such as subjective [19,20] and integrated [24–26] weight
methods, the objective entropy weight method [22] was adopted, which also significantly decreased
manpower.
In determining the number of hidden neurons, there were not consistent results [38–41]. This paper
provided a new method for determining the number of hidden neurons according to the mean square
error of training samples. The results showed that mean square error of training samples was the
smallest when the number of hidden neurons was 9 and the epoch 140 when training BP neural network,
and the relative error of the prediction samples was 0.62%. BP neural network is a widely used
prediction technique, but there is few studies refer to the basic principle [27–29], which does not
conducive to the improvement of the algorithm. Therefore, relevant theory of BP neural network was
deduced before predicting missing data, such that there will be a general understanding of the prediction
principle. To demonstrate the validity and feasibility of BP neural network adopted in the process of
missing data prediction, gray system theory [20] was applied to compare the result of missing data
prediction. The relative error of predictive value was 2.64% based on gray system theory. The results
showed that the predictive value of BP neural network was more precision than gray system theory. The
composite model proposed in this paper can be used for related research in this field.
To simplify the discussion, the identification coefficient in formula 2 was only set as 0.5. Future study
should focus on the influence of the identification coefficient in optimizing process parameters as well as
the influence of different training functions in BP neural network on the prediction results.

3.1. Optimization of performance parameters based on gray relational analysis
Sand casting performance parameters have a significant impact on casting quality, such that
selection of the appropriate performance parameters was needed. Taking 40 batches of floor sand
in the casting line, the original data of performance parameters in this foundry sand sample were
measured, including venting quality (VQ), wet compressive strength (WCS), moisture content
(MC), and compactability (Com) (Table 1) [37]. Among these performance parameters, VQ is the
ability that gas to penetrate high molecular material under a certain degree of pressure and time;
WCS refers to the ability of object to resist external pressure under the saturated water condition;
MC is the percentage of water content to the total mass of the object; Com is the proportion of the
volume change of the object under a certain degree of pressure.

In Table 1, assuming that all parameters were within a reasonable range, meeting the normal
production of sand casting. The VQ and WCS are the larger the better assessment indicators,
therefore they are positive indicators. The MC is the smaller the better assessment indicator, so it's
negative indicator. There is interaction effect among these performance parameters. Com refers to
the volume change of green sand under a certain degree of pressure. With increased Com, the
WCS of sand increased. After the Com reached a certain level, the WCS did not increase much.
But, the VQ decreased rapidly with continued increased Com. If the parameter Com was too large,
the parameter VQ would be small; otherwise, if the parameter Com was too small, the parameter
WCS would also be small. Therefore, Com belonged to the moderate indicator category, not too
large or too small.
The original data matrix was nondimensionalized according to formula (1), and the ideal project
D* = [1.0765 1.0483 0.9702 1] was achieved, where the optimal value of Com was the average of
the nondimensionalized data.
The gray relational coefficient of evaluation indicators can be obtained based on formula (2),
shown in Table 1.
In order to get the GRD of evaluation indicators, their weights should be know first. The
weights of the evaluation indicators, including VQ, WCS, MC, and Com, were achieved by
entropy weight method based on formulas (4)–(6), shown in Table 2.

The GRD of foundry sand was achieved based on formulas (3) and the weights of the
evaluation indicators (Table 3).

As shown in Table 2, the GRD of sample batch 22 was the largest, which was the closest to the
ideal project. Thus, it was advised that the performance parameters of sand casting refer to batch
22 to ensure safe casting and improve casting quality.

Comment 1: Give more importance for the experiment and not on the basis of the optimization
tool
Response: Thank you for your valuable and thoughtful comment. More importance for the
experiment have been added in the manuscript as follows.
Among these performance parameters, VQ is the ability that gas to penetrate high molecular
material under a certain degree of pressure and time. The venting capacity of sand casting is not
only increased by the riser and gas vent, but also by the VQ of the foundry sand. The VQ of
foundry sand should not be too low, so as to avoid the occurrence of boiling and pore defects in
the casting process. But, the VQ of foundry sand should not be too high, so as to prevent the
molten metal from infiltrating into the porosity, which will cause rough surface or abreuvage of
casting. Therefore, the VQ of the foundry sand needs to be within an appropriate range, and
should not be too high or too low. For high density molding, the VQ of foundry sand should be
high. For low and medium density molding, the VQ of foundry sand should be low.
WCS refers to the ability of object to resist external pressure under the saturated water
condition. If the WCS of foundry sand is insufficient, the sand mould may be damaged or
collapsed during the process of drawing and mould assembling; in the pouring process, the sand
mould may not withstand the impact of molten metal, which will cause blisters or even molten
metal discharging from the parting surface. However, the WCS of foundry sand is not the higher
the better. The higher WCS of foundry sand needs more bentonite, which not only affects the MC
and VQ of foundry sand, but also increases the cost of casting. In addition, the higher WCS of
foundry sand brings difficulties to the process of sand milling and shakeout.
MC is the percentage of water content to the total mass of the object. If the MC of foundry sand
is low, the VQ of foundry sand will be high, and the casting is prone to sand burning. If the MC of
foundry sand is high, a large amount of gas will be generated in the cavity due to evaporation of
moisture during the pouring process. Once the gas in the cavity cannot be discharged smoothly
within a limited time, an explosion accident may occur. Therefore, the MC of foundry sand should
have a suitable range according to the filed practice.
Com is the proportion of the volume change of the object under a certain degree of pressure. On
the one hand, the Com of foundry sand should not be too small, otherwise the bentonite will be
insufficiently wetted, leading the foundry sand to brittleness, low surface strength and difficulty in
drawing. On the other hand, the Com of foundry sand should not be too large, otherwise the
castings are prone to boiling and pore defects.
In Table S1, assuming that all the performance parameters were within a reasonable range,
meeting the normal production of sand casting. From the above analysis, it is know that all the
performance parameters, namely VQ, WCS, MC and Com, belonged to the moderate indicator
category, not too large or too small.
Comment 2: More justification needed on why this optimization tool is used and why not others.
Response: Thank you for your valuable advice. More justification have been added in the
manuscript on why this optimization tool is used and why not others, shown as follows.
When optimization the sand casting performance parameters, usually one parameter in batch A
reach the ideal value, and another parameter in batch B reach the ideal value, but not all the
parameters in one batch can reach the ideal values at the same time. Therefore, it's of great
significance to optimization the performance parameters in single batch. The common
optimization method of sand casting performance parameters is Taguchi's method [14], but this
method has some disadvantages. First, the test number of orthogonal array in Taguchi's method is
too much, which requires much experimentation and increases costs, and this is counter to its
purpose of reducing costs. Second, the purpose of Taguchi's method is to reduce the effects of
mutagenic factors rather than removing the mutagenic factors to improve quality. Third, despite
the large amount of data, we are still unable to obtain any information about the interaction
between controllable variable factors. Fourth, if there is no interaction between the controllable
factors and interference factors, then a sound design does not exist. Therefore, it's necessary to
find a simple method for optimizing sand casting performance parameters. A novel optimization
method of performance parameters based on gray relational analysis was introduced here.
Gray relational analysis is a very active branch in gray system theory. Its basic idea is to
determine the gray relational degree between different sequences according to the geometrical
shape of the sequence curves [15]. The larger the gray relational degree, the closer the project
evaluated was to the ideal project. Accordingly, the order of the projects evaluated can be
confirmed. Gray relational analysis does not require too many samples, nor does the sample have
a typical distribution law, and the workload of calculation is relatively small. The gray relational
analysis results are in good agreement with the qualitative analysis results. Gray relational analysis
has been applied to many fields, such as decision-making [16], green supplier selection [17], and
quality evaluation of red wine [18]. Wei [16] has investigated the dynamic hybrid multiple
attribute decision-making problems based on gray relational analysis. In this study, gray relational
analysis was used for optimization of sand casting performance parameters. During the process of
gray relational analysis, assessment indicator weights should first be calculated.
Comment 3: Why authors have chosen the factors of performance parameters and what all other
possible performance parameters in sand casting explain in details.
Response: Thank you for your instructive suggestion. All other possible performance parameters
in sand casting have been added in the revision paper, and explanation has been added on why we
chose these four factors of performance parameters, shown as follows.
3.1. Selection of Sand casting performance parameters
The foundry sand has many performance parameters, and each of them has an impact on the
casting quality. However, the influence of each performance parameter on the casting quality is
not the same, and the testing frequency is smaller for the performance parameter which is more
important for improving the casting quality. The sand casting performance parameters and their
testing frequency are shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Sand casting performance parameters and their testing frequency
performance parameters sampling spot testing frequency
venting quality (VQ), wet discharge port of sand mill, or once every half to two hours
compressive strength (WCS), conveyer of foundry sand
moisture content (MC), under the hopper of molding once every four to five hours
compactability (Com) machine
content of effective braize, content under the hopper of molding once a day
of effective bentonite, wet-heat machine
tensile strength
content of clay, content of lump, under the hopper of molding once a week
grain composition machine
sand temperature, availability of under the hopper of molding in case of need
bentonite, mobility, fracture and machine
heat shock time
As is shown in Table 1, the sand casting performance parameters such as VQ, WCS, MC and
Com are the most important factors for improving the casting quality, and the testing frequency is
also the smallest. Therefore, this study optimizes the performance parameters such as VQ, WCS,
MC and Com for improving casting quality.
