This paper explores variation in self-directed behaviour (SDB) in wild Japanese macaques,
simultaneously exploring hypotheses linked to parasitological, social and environmental factors.
To my mind, the paper definitely meets the selection criteria for Royal Society Open Science. I
very much liked the ‘information theory’ approach adopted by the authors to explore and
compare the explanatory power of not only each of the three types of variable, but also all
possible combinations of these. This method is particularly powerful in exploring hypotheses
related to SDB as these hypotheses are so closely interlinked. I have not previously come across
this sort of approach being used in this particular way, and it is clearly a powerful and valuable
tool for such work.
I have one thing I think the authors really do need to do (point 1 below), one that I would
encourage them to do to improve the structure and flow of the paper (point 2 below) and then a
list of suggested minor edits that I hope are useful.
*Point 1.*
Line 296-307. The authors do not mention in this section the *only* variable for which CI does not
include 0. They should do so, I feel.
3
*Point 2.*
Lines 125-146. This may seem a stylistic issue, but I did find it strange to see the authors write
that after testing hypotheses 1-7, they would then use predictions to interpret findings. This logic
and structure appears to give the predictions something of a post hoc explanatory role, while in
reality they directly underpin the hypotheses in question. Predictions are, by definition, things
stated in advance and then tested, not stated after the fact and used in an interpretative
framework. I think the Introduction would be much improved if the text in lines 127-146 were
integrated into the preceding paragraphs.
*Minor suggested edits*
Line 36. Change to ‘compared’ to maintain tense consistency.
Line 42. Insert ‘these’ before ‘animals’ (it is not all animals, but rather the study animals/species)
Line 44. Delete ‘for’. I suggest this sentence would read better as ‘We advocate that biological
hypotheses be more broadly considered, even when investigating...’
Line 60. If ectoparasites are ‘ubiquitous’ they should, strictly speaking, be found on *all* animals.
I would suggest rewording to ‘Ectoparasites are common on many animals’.
Line 72-74. The authors might consider adding the functional explanation here, i.e. that SDBs
have been proposed to function to mediate stress/anxiety.
Line 74. This sentence is very unclear. I suggest changing to ‘SDBs in long-tailed macaques are
increased by administration of anxiogenic drugs and decreased by anxiolytic drugs.’
Lines 91-93. This sentence does not make sense (to me at least!). The authors could change
‘together’ in line 93 to ‘previously’. Alternatively, the sentence could be rewritten as ‘To our
knowledge, hypotheses relating to whether frequencies of SDB are better explained by one or a
combination of parasitic, social and environmental factors have not previously been considered
together’
Line 94. I would delete ‘several’
Lines 114-124. [This is a personal preference so the authors should feel free to ignore] I would
prefer to have the integrated hypothesis last in this list i.e. start with each single variable set, then
the combinations of two, and finally the combination of all three.
Line 120, 121, 123. To keep consistency with line 114, I would replace ‘both’ with combination of’
Line 133. Replace ‘estimate’ with ‘relationship’
Line 138. Change ‘aggression rate’ to rate of aggression received’
Line 141-142. I suggest rewriting as ‘we might predict that in summer (short hair) less pelage care
is required than in winter (long hair)’
Line 144. Insert ‘the need for’ before ‘pelage’
Line 160. Insert ‘Data on’ before ‘agonistic’
Line 160. The authors say ‘such as those including’, which suggests this is only a subset of the
behaviours. I think it is the full list so would replace with ‘i.e. those including’. If it is not the full
list I would give that list.
Line 184 (and throughout the ms). I would replace ‘protocol’ with ‘sample’ or ‘observation’. To
my mind, a protocol is something you follow when making a focal observation.
Line 120 and 122. As written, there seems to be a contradiction here i.e. between ‘only considered
focal data’ and ‘during her focal protocol and from our ad libitum’
Line 253. Should this be ‘Focal animal identity’?
Line 257. Maybe insert ‘tested and found to be’ before ‘fulfilled’?
Line 293. Insert ‘on average’ before ‘6.9’
Line 302. The authors say ‘this model’ but I think (I could be wrong!) this parameter estimate is
averaged over all the models in the candidate set. Should this therefore say ‘these models’?
Line 316. Delete ‘also’
Line 322. Figure 1 is not referred to in the text of the results.
Line 339. Some references after ‘ungulates and birds’ would be useful here.
Line 340. I suggest rewriting as ‘neglected in primates because, amongst other reasons, they are
social animals’
4
Line 352. I suggest rewriting as ‘in accordance with its proposed role in tension reduction’
Line 357. Insert ‘in this context’ after ‘SDBs’?
Line 390. This seems a little vague – could the authors clarify what they mean here?
Table 3. Insert ‘of the model with the lowest AIC’ after ‘ < 4’

I understand the authors are aware of the limitation of their study by the responses from the
authors. For example, a sentence “We focused on females because they form the core of the group
and dominate social dynamics, males are often few and peripheral, and juveniles are difficult to
recognise and observe” is added in Methods citing the authors’ previous work. I think the added
point is true in your study group. However, as the authors may know, there are many previous
studies which describe various social systems of Japanese macaques which are different from the
group in this study. Some previous studies pointed that some males in a group are not
peripheral, some studies noted the importance of sex differences in social dominance, and some
studies discussed the importance of kin-relationship of Japanese macaques. For example, I found
an article written about the importance of kin-relationship in self-directed behaviors in the
situation of post-conflict stress (Kutsukake et al, 2001). This is a reference that you did not
mentioned. I want to ask why the previous work of the authors are chosen to describe the social
system of Japanese macaques though there are many previous works on it. The authors wanted
to emphasize the special situation of monkey group in Kojima? I also want to ask why the
authors wrote it in Methods. When I read the added sentence in the text, I thought the readers of
Royal Society Open Science would get wrong impression as all Japanese macaques make a group
in which females form the core of the group and males are often few and peripheral, and
juveniles are difficult to recognize and observe. I think the limitation of this work should be noted
in Introduction by citing some previous studies on the social systems of Japanese macaques. If the
authors wanted to show the present study as a case in Kojima, I recommend the title should be
changed as “Scratch that itch: revisiting links between self-directed behaviour and
parasitological, social and environmental factors in a free-ranging female Japanese macaques in
Kojima Island.” The readers who have another image on Japanese macaques will understand the
value of the present study well.

Detailed comments
(1) Ticks
As the authors mentioned, Tanaka and Takefushi (1993) described that louse eggs are picked off
during grooming. But they did not write the monkeys were not infested by ticks. If the ticks on
the body were NOT removed as louse eggs, the tick bite may cause scratch among monkeys.
Some primatologists may say it is unimaginable because monkeys can remove everything on the
body, and ticks must be picked if there are. But there is a report on the death of baboons caused
by the tick infestation (Brain 1992).
Some specialists of mammalogy may be difficult to image a mammal which are not infested by
ticks. Ticks may not removed by Japanese monkeys, but they may infested.
I think it is better to describe the reason why ticks are not investigated in Introduction of this
study. (e.g. references on the study of the lack of ticks in Kojima)
(2) Two distances
I understand well that one of the variables are also based on the previous study.
(3) Mating
As the authors’ response, there is a seasonality on mating of Japanese macaques. But not every
females mate in mating season. For example, females who have infants do not show much in
estrus. In this study, the data on estrous and anestrous females are pooled. In this case, season
may not reflect the mating effect.
In addition, four seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall) are investigated in this study, but the
results is possibly changed by investigating two seasons (mating season/ not mating season).
Anyway, I did not say that the lack of investigation is problem. Researchers cannot do
everything. But researchers usually make a plan of investigation by reference to previous studies.
In my previous comments, I asked for explanation why the authors did not choose some
investigations. I am a reader of this study, and I am also a reader of previous studies. The images
of social and environment factors in this study are something different from the arguments of the
previous studies. I think the study will be better if the authors explain the reasons of the
investigations in this study with referring relevant previous studies.

I am hard to understand some brevity code. For example, I found "mating" in the database, but
the authors described that they investigated "reproductive status."

Mating (1) may be a fact that the mating female was reproductively active. BUT it is not always
true that a female who was not mating during observation time (0) was not reproductively active.
If males moved peripheral place, reproductively active females would lost the chance for mating.
If the authors judged whether "reproductively active" or not by observing "mating" or not, the
authors should describe it in Methods.

I think the readers of Royal Society Open Science will judge the significance of this article by
reading well-revised Introduction and Methods. I also think the worth of this paper rises by the
added variable “reproductive status” that is directly related to the discussion (Line 413).
However, I want to ask a question.
Line 409-412
As the authors wrote, I think “Japanese macaque society is governed by strict rules following
dominance and kinship relationships”. As I mentioned in the previous comments, kin-
relationship is a key factor for SDB in the situation of post-conflict stress. However, the authors
did not investigate kinship relationship in this study. I want to ask why they did not describe the
lack of key factor though they knew the importance of kinship relationship. The authors wrote

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
The paper by Duboscq et al. aims to assess the effect of ectoparasite load as well as social and
environmental factors on the occurrence of self-scratching and self-grooming. While previous
studies have looked at each of these factors separately, this paper is the first to examine them
together, making the manuscript (and its conclusions) very interesting and relevant to a broad
readership. Although I have not looked at the previous versions of the draft myself, I believe that
the authors have addressed the previous reviewer’s comments adequately. Even if I find the MS
suitable for publications, I have some questions/queries/comments myself:
1) In the introduction (lines 138-139) as well as in the methods (lines 265-270), the authors predict
that SDBs should be higher under reproductive pressure (when cycling, pregnant and lactating).
However, they do not provide any rationale or cite any paper to justify this prediction. Firstly,
what do the authors mean by ‘reproductive pressure’? Furthermore, the authors lump together
cycling, pregnant and lactating females, but it is unlikely that they all have to face the same
constrains. Do cycling females in Japanese macaques receive more attention from males and thus
should be more anxious? Off the top of my head I can think of only a few papers that have looked
at the effect of being in aestrous and stress/anxiety that the authors might want to consider for
their paper: in ring-tailed lemurs, for instance, individuals scratch more during the high-swelling
period than during the low-swelling period (Sclafani et al. 2012), while in chimpanzees, females
experience higher levels of urinary cortisol when they are in oestrus than when non in oestrus
(Muller et al., 2007), although in this latter case the authors did not look at self-directed
behaviours. In contrast, pregnant and lactating females face probably energetic costs. Moreover,
in the methods the authors do not mention how they assessed whether a female was cycling or
not (i.e. sexual swelling?). This information might be useful in particular for researchers who are
not familiar with Japanese macaques. Finally, the authors do not discuss the lack of effect of
reproductive status on SDBs in the discussion, and I think they should add a section in which
they put these results in perspective.
2) In line 168 the authors should give more details on the provisioning of the monkeys. Currently,
they provide this information only in Table 1.
3) In line 178-179, the authors should state how they selected the focal animal (i.e. using a
predetermined randomized list?).
15
4) Lines 185-186. The authors state that they counted the number of louse egg-picking gestures,
but they do not mention in what context they count the gestures (i.e. during self-grooming or
social grooming). Given that they mention this after talking about self-scratching events in line
186, it might sound like they recorded louse egg-picking behaviour during self-scratching, but
later on (lines 194-196) the authors state that they counted louse egg-picking gesture during social
grooming.
5) lines 207-211: there are models that can handle zero-inflated data sets with Poisson
distribution. Have the authors considered this type of models? I believe that using actual count
data, rather than a binary variable presence/absence might be more accurate, as it might reflect
better the variation within and between females in number of self-scratching and self-grooming
bouts.
6) Lines 215-216. Given that the aim of the work is to assess whether the occurrence of SDBs like
self-grooming is linked to parasite load, I am wondering why the authors decided to measure
parasite load by using the amount of louse eggs removed during social grooming, as opposed to
the amount of lice eggs individuals removed during self-grooming. Given that during social
grooming monkeys have the opportunity to remove ectoparasites from body parts (like the back)
from which it is not possible to remove ectoparasites during self-grooming (or self-scratching), I
assume that the ectoparasite load that the authors have calculated is an overestimation of the
actual amount of ectoparasites individuals can remove through self-grooming. If the authors do
not have the data on the amount of ectoparasites removed during self-grooming, they should at
least bring up this point in the discussion.
7) Some of the models that the authors build up have a large number of independent variables
(the integrated model has 12 variables): have the authors checked for colinearity among these
variables before including them in the model? I assume that aggression received during focal
might be correlated to the aggression received during ad libitum observations, or rank with
aggression received (as the authors state in lines 232-233), or temperature with season.
8) In the supplementary material (the dataset) the authors should spell out more clearly what the
different columns represent (trying to avoid usingthe use of abbreviations, or giving a legend to
explain what the abbreviations stand for).

Comments to the Author(s)
I think the readers of Royal Society Open Science will judge the significance of this article by
reading well-revised Introduction and Methods. I also think the worth of this paper rises by the
added variable “reproductive status” that is directly related to the discussion (Line 413).
However, I want to ask a question.
Line 409-412
As the authors wrote, I think “Japanese macaque society is governed by strict rules following
dominance and kinship relationships”. As I mentioned in the previous comments, kin-
relationship is a key factor for SDB in the situation of post-conflict stress. However, the authors
did not investigate kinship relationship in this study. I want to ask why they did not describe the
lack of key factor though they knew the importance of kinship relationship. The authors wrote
“Interestingly, social and environment factors had less weight in explaining variation in self-
directed behaviors when compared to lice load”. I don’t think it is interesting. AIC may draw a
biased conclusion when a key variable is excluded from the model.
18
Anyway, I did not say that the lack of investigation is problem, as I wrote in the previous
comments. It seems that “Discussion” was not revised in this revision though “Introduction”,
“Methods”, and “Results” were revised. Did the authors forget to revise “Discussion”? I think the
paper will be better if “the lack of key variable” is described in it.
(The rank of adult males are higher than that of adult females among Japanese macaques. I
understand the difficulty of investigation for males in Kojima, but if the lack of investigation
affect the results, it should be mentioned in Discussion, because some previous studies
considered male-female relationship as a kind of dominance relationship.)

The manuscript entitled “Scratch that itch: revisiting links between
self-directed behaviour and parasitological, social and environmental factors in a
free-ranging primate” is one of the study to consider the function of self-directed
behaviors (SDB) in a comprehensive manner. The authors made models including some
variables related to parasitological, social, and environmental hypotheses and found the
most likely model by using AIC. I think many primatologists are interested in the main
purpose of this study because SDBs are one of the key indexes in primate research. For
this reason, this kind of study should be conducted in a circumspect way.
AIC is powerful tool for considering some models constructed by some given
factors, however, it may draw a wrong conclusion if the given variables are inadequate.
From this perspective, some variables used as indexes seem not to be well-considered in
this manuscript.
For example, ticks are excluded from explanatory variables. The seasonality of
ectoparasite load is considered as environmental factor around line 82 by referring
Mooring’s work [8, 27]. The authors did not mentioned in detail, Mooring investigated
the seasonality of the number of TICKs in the environment of host species, and
Japanese macaques have been known to remove TICKs as well as louse eggs [30, 32].
These references, which is cited by the authors in introduction, and are not mentioned
in detail, pointed out the fact that ticks are one of an important element to consider
“parasitological hypothesis” and “environmental hypothesis.” The authors should
explain why ticks are excluded from explanatory values in the models before using AIC.
Two variables associated with social hypothesis also need to be explained. The
variables, “proportion of higher-ranking females within 10 m proximity” and “number of
female neighbours within 5 m proximity” are found in Table 1, why the distance of
proximity are different between two variables though both variables are indicators of
anxiety?
I also point out the lack of explanation why only adult females were chosen for
study objects. Japanese macaques are well-studied animals and have been known to
make a troop including adult males, immature males, immature females as well as
adult females. If the data on other age-sex class macaques are available, the authors
can make deep consideration for the social hypothesis. (e. g. See line 370. If the authors
want to consider the reproduction, they should add the data on adult males and/or
copulation between males and females as explanatory values). The authors concluded
that SDBs are little affected by social factor, but this conclusion may be caused by the
biased sample.
The authors tried to consider some hypotheses on SDBs comprehensively,
however, I received the impression that they pay little attention to social and
environmental hypothesis (e. g. the number of members of the study troop and the rank
of study subjects are not even described). I provide some more detailed comments on the
manuscript below.
Line 139 – 146. As the authors confused, it is difficult to understand why short/long hair
is considered here. If the authors want to choose some variables related to
environmental conditions, ticks (see Mooring’s article in line 82) and mating (see line
370) should be chosen because these factors were introduced or discussed in the
manuscript.
Line 152. The number of monkeys and the number of each age-sex classes of study troop
should be mentioned.
Line 155. Here, the authors wrote they observed 19 – 20 adult females, but in results,
they wrote N = 20 (line 294 - 295). Which is correct?
The rank of females also should be mentioned.
Line 172. Explain why pooled counts of self-grooming were used as the variable though
the data on scratching events were counted only in the interval between minute-scan.
Line 173 – 175. Make clear the meaning of the term “grooming” in this text. Is it “social
grooming” or “self-grooming and social grooming”?
Line 204 – 208. Social grooming also reduces the number of louse eggs, therefore, I
think, it is not only social variables but also parasitological variable.
Line 229 – 232. There are many studies on the proximity of Japanese macaques, so the
distance of proximity in this study should be designed by referring these previous
studies.
Line 239. Is there any supporting evidence that the temperature and rainfall in Kojima
is same as that of the city 25 km from Kojima?
What is the name of the city?
(I recommend automatic measurement instruments if the authors have
difficulty to visit study site.)
Line 302 – 303. Add an explanation why lice loads were changed between months if
possible. Is it caused by social grooming (social hypothesis) or environmental factors?
Line 370. The variables on environmental factors in this manuscript are “rainfall”,
“temperature” and “four seasons” and the authors do not considered the reproduction
(e.g. “mating season”). Write discussion considering the measured variables in this
manuscript. The unmeasured variables are still open to discussion.
thank the reviewers for their participation at improving the manuscript. Here is a point-by-point
onse.
ewer: 1
ve one thing I think the authors really do need to do (point 1 below), one that I would encourage them
o to improve the structure and flow of the paper (point 2 below) and then a list of suggested minor edits
I hope are useful.
nt 1.*
296-307. The authors do not mention in this section the *only* variable for which CI does not include
hey should do so, I feel.
onse: thank you for pointing out this oversight. We added the results pertaining to this variable (lines
-324, and 336).
nt 2.*
s 125-146. This may seem a stylistic issue, but I did find it strange to see the authors write that after
ng hypotheses 1-7, they would then use predictions to interpret findings. This logic and structure
ears to give the predictions something of a post hoc explanatory role, while in reality they directly
erpin the hypotheses in question. Predictions are, by definition, things stated in advance and then
ed, not stated after the fact and used in an interpretative framework. I think the Introduction would be
h improved if the text in lines 127-146 were integrated into the preceding paragraphs.
onse: we integrated the suggested lines into the preceding paragraphs, lines 111-149.
or suggested edits*
36. Change to ‘compared’ to maintain tense consistency.
onse: we changed accordingly, line 36.
42. Insert ‘these’ before ‘animals’ (it is not all animals, but rather the study animals/species)
onse: we changed to “the study animals”, line 42.
44. Delete ‘for’. I suggest this sentence would read better as ‘We advocate that biological hypotheses
ore broadly considered, even when investigating...’
onse: we changed accordingly, lines 44-45.
60. If ectoparasites are ‘ubiquitous’ they should, strictly speaking, be found on *all* animals. I would
est rewording to ‘Ectoparasites are common on many animals’.
onse: we changed accordingly, line 57.
72-74. The authors might consider adding the functional explanation here, i.e. that SDBs have been
osed to function to mediate stress/anxiety.
onse: we changed accordingly, line 71.
74. This sentence is very unclear. I suggest changing to ‘SDBs in long-tailed macaques are increased by
inistration of anxiogenic drugs and decreased by anxiolytic drugs.’
onse: we changed accordingly, lines 71-73.
s 91-93. This sentence does not make sense (to me at least!). The authors could change ‘together’ in
93 to ‘previously’. Alternatively, the sentence could be rewritten as ‘To our knowledge, hypotheses
ing to whether frequencies of SDB are better explained by one or a combination of parasitic, social and
ronmental factors have not previously been considered together’
onse: we changed accordingly, lines 90-92.
94. I would delete ‘several’
onse: we changed accordingly, line 93.
s 114-124. [This is a personal preference so the authors should feel free to ignore] I would prefer to
e the integrated hypothesis last in this list i.e. start with each single variable set, then the combinations
o, and finally the combination of all three.
onse: this section was written again, lines 111-149
120, 121, 123. To keep consistency with line 114, I would replace ‘both’ with combination of’
onse: we changed accordingly, lines 141, 143, 146.
133. Replace ‘estimate’ with ‘relationship’
onse: we changed accordingly, line 120.
138. Change ‘aggression rate’ to rate of aggression received’
onse: we changed accordingly, line 129.
141-142. I suggest rewriting as ‘we might predict that in summer (short hair) less pelage care is
ired than in winter (long hair)’
onse: we changed accordingly, lines 133-135.
144. Insert ‘the need for’ before ‘pelage’
onse: we changed accordingly, line 136.
160. Insert ‘Data on’ before ‘agonistic’
onse: we changed accordingly, line 167.
160. The authors say ‘such as those including’, which suggests this is only a subset of the behaviours. I
k it is the full list so would replace with ‘i.e. those including’. If it is not the full list I would give that list.
onse: we modified the sentence to indicate it is a full list of behaviours, line 167.
184 (and throughout the ms). I would replace ‘protocol’ with ‘sample’ or ‘observation’. To my mind, a
ocol is something you follow when making a focal observation.
onse: we changed accordingly, lines 191, or 240 for example, and throughout the ms.
120 and 122. As written, there seems to be a contradiction here i.e. between ‘only considered focal
’ and ‘during her focal protocol and from our ad libitum’
onse: we clarified that sentence, lines 226-229.
253. Should this be ‘Focal animal identity’?
onse: yes it should and has been changed accordingly, line 269.
257. Maybe insert ‘tested and found to be’ before ‘fulfilled’?
onse: we changed accordingly, line 273.
293. Insert ‘on average’ before ‘6.9’
onse: we changed accordingly, line 309.
302. The authors say ‘this model’ but I think (I could be wrong!) this parameter estimate is averaged
all the models in the candidate set. Should this therefore say ‘these models’?
onse: we replaced by “In models including lice load as a predictor,” line 318.
316. Delete ‘also’
onse: we changed accordingly, line 336.
322. Figure 1 is not referred to in the text of the results.
onse: we added reference to it lines 316, 318, and 334.

is powerful tool for considering some models constructed by some given factors, however, it may draw a
ng conclusion if the given variables are inadequate. From this perspective, some variables used as
xes seem not to be well-considered in this manuscript. For example, ticks are excluded from
anatory variables. The seasonality of ectoparasite load is considered as environmental factor around line
y referring Mooring’s work [8, 27]. The authors did not mentioned in detail, Mooring investigated the
onality of the number of TICKs in the environment of host species, and Japanese macaques have been
wn to remove TICKs as well as louse eggs [30, 32]. These references, which is cited by the authors in
duction, and are not mentioned in detail, pointed out the fact that ticks are one of an important element
onsider “parasitological hypothesis” and “environmental hypothesis.” The authors should explain why
are excluded from explanatory values in the models before using AIC.
onse: thank you for pointing out this inconsistency. We would like to provide two clarifications here.
e indeed refer to the work of Mooring as examples of seasonality in ectoparasites subsequently linked
easonal variation in SDBs. We now clarified the sentence lines 85-86 “Underlying mechanisms behind
environmental hypothesis are often linked to ectoparasite load because the life cycle of many
parasites is also influenced by environmental seasonality and their abundance thus fluctuates
onally”. Note that the references attached to that statement include works on both tick [8,27] and louse
.
e focus on lice for several reasons: the study by Tanaka and Takefushi 1993 clearly states that they
rved only one individual once removing one tick from the hair of her infant, but that the behavioural
ence of picking up the tick was very different from picking up louse imagoes or eggs and the observed
ale did not eat the tick. We focused on louse egg-picking because it is by far the most frequent and
ous anti-ectoparasite behaviour that we can observed in Japanese macaques. Deviations from the
avioural sequence linked to picking louse eggs was disregarded; picking ticks seems very rare and was
observed in the Kojima population.
added a statement in the discussion that “a broader range of ectoparasites such as ticks and fleas” could
ncluded in future studies (line 414).
variables associated with social hypothesis also need to be explained. The variables, “proportion of
er-ranking females within 10 m proximity” and “number of female neighbours within 5 m proximity” are
d in Table 1, why the distance of proximity are different between two variables though both variables
ndicators of anxiety?
onse: thank you for giving us the opportunity to clarify. These two distances were part of the focal
ocol when collecting neighbours’ presence in proximity and are included in two factors representing two
rent aspects of sociality, social integration on one hand and social uncertainty on the other hand.
ichi 1983 showed that the tolerance/intolerance distance under which individuals have to resort to
er aggression or affiliation to regulate their relationships is about 1m. We wanted to avoid such influence
e selected longer distances within our observation protocol, i.e. between 1-5m and within 10m. First,
wanted to have a measure of social integration, or how social a female can be, and the number of other
ale partners between 1 and 5m, our next proximity category, seemed to be a good candidate.
cerning the effect of the presence of higher-ranking females, we took the longest distance because we
oned that if a higher-ranking individual approaches within a circle of 10m, it is also likely to approach
er to the tolerance/intolerance threshold and this uncertainty, even at 10m, could potentially already
er SDB given the high proportion of approach-in-proximity resulting in negative social interactions in
nese macaques (Chaffin et al. 1995). We added some explanations in the text to clarify this: “We chose
different proximity thresholds, a radius of 5m proximity representative of social integration and a radius
0m representative of social uncertainty potential. This was based on the facts that first, Japanese
aques living under natural conditions seem to tolerate each other without aggression above a proximity
shold of 1m (still within 5m) [46]. Second, given the high proportion (20%) of negative social
actions resulting from entering the proximity of another individual [47], it is fair to assume that the
oach of a higher-ranking individual as far as 10m can already potentially create uncertainty as to how
animal will behave.” lines 242-249.
o point out the lack of explanation why only adult females were chosen for study objects. Japanese
aques are well-studied animals and have been known to make a troop including adult males, immature
es, immature females as well as adult females. If the data on other age-sex class macaques are
lable, the authors can make deep consideration for the social hypothesis. (e. g. See line 370. If the
ors want to consider the reproduction, they should add the data on adult males and/or copulation
een males and females as explanatory values). The authors concluded that SDBs are little affected by
al factor, but this conclusion may be caused by the biased sample.
onse: we are aware that a limitation of our study is the focus on females only. However we would like
oint out that females form the core of the group and are the thus some of the most sociable group
bers. We added a sentence to acknowledge this limitation: “We focused on females because they form
core of the group and dominate social dynamics, males are often few and peripheral, and juveniles are
cult to recognise and observe [33].” lines 161-163.
authors tried to consider some hypotheses on SDBs comprehensively,
ever, I received the impression that they pay little attention to social and environmental hypothesis (e.
e number of members of the study troop and the rank of study subjects are not even described). I
ide some more detailed comments on the manuscript below.
139 – 146. As the authors confused, it is difficult to understand why short/long hair is considered here.
e authors want to choose some variables related to environmental conditions, ticks (see Mooring’s
le in line 82) and mating (see line 370) should be chosen because these factors were introduced or
ussed in the manuscript.
onse: this paragraph pertains to environmental factors influencing SDBs. Ticks are not measured for
ral reasons (see comment above). Mating is both a social and an environmental factor but its influence
DBs is deeply linked to environmental factors because reproduction is seasonal. As such, including
on as a variable in the environmental model accounts for variation in sociality due to season and
acting SDBs. Variation in sociality due to social processes alone and impacting SDBs would be accounted
n the social model. Furthermore, the synergetic influences of social, environmental, and parasitological
ables on SDBs are investigated through the integrated model. If mating was a strong factor, then season
ld significantly contribute to explaining the occurrence of SDBs. As such, and following the current study
gn, we do not think that including mating independently of season (which it is not) would provide more
anatory value than the variables we have included already.
152. The number of monkeys and the number of each age-sex classes of study troop should be
tioned.
onse: we added this information line 160.
155. Here, the authors wrote they observed 19 – 20 adult females, but in results, they wrote N = 20
294 - 295). Which is correct?
onse: we added clarification here line 158-159.
rank of females also should be mentioned.
onse: The rank of females are given in the data file that is made available in the supplementary
mation (line 263).
172. Explain why pooled counts of self-grooming were used as the variable though the data on
tching events were counted only in the interval between minute-scan.
onse: self-grooming is a state and can thus be recorded as an activity; yet sometimes it occurred for
than a minute and did not fall on the minute-scan point but it was important to record it so an extra
mn for such instances was added to our data collection sheet. Scratching is an event that we counted as
in its own column on the data sheet.
173 – 175. Make clear the meaning of the term “grooming” in this text. Is it “social grooming” or “self-
ming and social grooming”?
onse: we added clarifications line 181.
204 – 208. Social grooming also reduces the number of louse eggs, therefore, I think, it is not only
al variables but also parasitological variable.
onse: We agree with this statement but the parasite model only looks at variables directly linked to
sitism. Lice load is also influenced by seasonality and could be influenced by the host’s rank and other
ors we cannot account for in this model. This is investigated more fully with the integrated model where
ariables are put together to investigate these synergies.
229 – 232. There are many studies on the proximity of Japanese macaques, so the distance of
imity in this study should be designed by referring these previous studies.
onse: we now refer to a study by Furuichi 1983 as this author investigated different proximities and
effects on Japanese macaques’ social behaviour, very pertinent here, lines 246-248.
239. Is there any supporting evidence that the temperature and rainfall in Kojima is same as that of the
25 km from Kojima?What is the name of the city?(I recommend automatic measurement instruments if
authors have
culty to visit study site.)
onse: we unfortunately didn’t have access to automatic local weather measurements at the time of the
y. We describe in the text that data come from the nearest weather station on the same coast as the
site and give the name of the city (Aburatsu) where the weather station is, line 256.
302 – 303. Add an explanation why lice loads were changed between months if possible. Is it caused by
al grooming (social hypothesis) or environmental factors?
onse: lice loads normally vary across time for various reasons but any statement about the reasons
remain speculative so far although we can estimate it (see Duboscq et al 2016 if interested). In the
ent study, this variation is taken into account by the design of the analysis but is not, and need not be,
focus of it.
370. The variables on environmental factors in this manuscript are “rainfall”, “temperature” and “four
ons” and the authors do not considered the reproduction (e.g. “mating season”). Write discussion
idering the measured variables in this manuscript. The unmeasured variables are still open to
ussion.
onse: see comments about lines 139-146 about not including mating or reproduction per se but having
presented by season, to some extent. We discuss the fact that although our study points to parasitism
main likely explanation for SDBs, it does not exclude the influence of other factors such as social
ety or environmental challenges. It actually shows that many factors are potentially involved (see lines
-401). We furthermore link our results to alternative mechanisms, one of which is reproductive state and
hormones, behaviours, immune and anxiety status linked to it (lines 402-409).

ments to the Author(s)
derstand the authors are aware of the limitation of their study by the responses from the authors. For
mple, a sentence “We focused on females because they form the core of the group and dominate social
amics, males are often few and peripheral, and juveniles are difficult to recognise and observe” is added
ethods citing the authors’ previous work. I think the added point is true in your study group. However,
he authors may know, there are many previous studies which describe various social systems of
nese macaques which are different from the group in this study. Some previous studies pointed that
e males in a group are not peripheral, some studies noted the importance of sex differences in social
inance, and some studies discussed the importance of kin-relationship of Japanese macaques. For
mple, I found an article written about the importance of kin-relationship in self-directed behaviors in the
ation of post-conflict stress (Kutsukake et al, 2001). This is a reference that you did not mentioned. I
t to ask why the previous work of the authors are chosen to describe the social system of Japanese
aques though there are many previous works on it. The authors wanted to emphasize the special
ation of monkey group in Kojima? I also want to ask why the authors wrote it in Methods. When I read
added sentence in the text, I thought the readers of Royal Society Open Science would get wrong
ession as all Japanese macaques make a group in which females form the core of the group and males
often few and peripheral, and juveniles are difficult to recognize and observe. I think the limitation of
work should be noted in Introduction by citing some previous studies on the social systems of Japanese
aques. If the authors wanted to show the present study as a case in Kojima, I recommend the title
ld be changed as “Scratch that itch: revisiting links between self-directed behaviour and parasitological,
al and environmental factors in a free-ranging female Japanese macaques in Kojima Island.” The readers
have another image on Japanese macaques will understand the value of the present study well.
onse: We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns and respond to them altogether here:
e acknowledge that Japanese macaques present intraspecific variation in their social structure and that
statement referred to here may be more appropriate for Kojima. This is why this statement is in the
hods because it does relate to the study population. We do not make any general statement about
nese macaques sociality in the introduction because of this. Nevertheless, to be perfectly clear, we
ed “We focused on females because in Kojima they form the stable core of the group and dominate
amics of social networks, whereas males migrate between groups, are often few, peripheral and not very
al, and juveniles are difficult to recognise and observe, and usually engage in different age-typical
ities than adults (note that intraspecific variation exists in Japanese macaques’ social structure
37,38]).” lines 173-177.
however that even in other populations of Japanese macaques, adult males are very often less
erous than adult females, per their social organization and mating system (see Yamagiwa and Hill 1998
imates, or Fooden and Aimi 2005 in Fieldiana Zoology), and even when a good number of males are
rally present in the group, they do remain rather peripheral and interact more rarely than females (for
lustration of this at Yakushima, see MacIntosh et al 2012 and the social network graphs presented in
paper – a few males occupy central positions but most are by far more socially peripheral than
ales).
he study mentioned by the reviewer concerns a narrow context of the occurrence of SDB whereas we
nvestigating general patterns. Furthermore, the social variables taken into account already include
ession occurrence to which reconciliation-related SDB is tightly linked. We also include number of
ales within 5m-proximity, which we know will mostly be kin (60 to 80% kin bias, Thierry et al. 2008 in
al Behaviour). We know kinship does influence behaviour and Japanese macaque society is kin-biased.
own data indicate that close kin (up to aunt-niece) are 1.2 to 4.9 times more frequently in proximity of
other. However, half of the study females do not have adult female close kin in the group, so taking
account only kinship instead of a more general index of social integration such as female close
hbours would significantly reduce the power of our analyses.
e understand the concern of avoiding to mislead the readers. That is precisely why we do not make any
ement about Japanese macaque society in the introduction but keep the details in the methods so that it
ear that it relates to the population under study and is not necessarily the case in all populations of
nese macaques.
e would like to keep the title as it is because we would argue that the paper is more about general
erns, not about what occurs in Kojima macaques in particular – Kojima macaques are just the model
. The introduction is general and includes literature on a wide variety of species. The interest of
enting data on Japanese macaques relates to the fact that they are social primates and the kind of
y we are presenting in this paper is lacking in social primates. From our point of view, the expression “in
e-ranging primate” also indicates the singularity of the study animals. We remain nevertheless open to
ge if the reviewer and the editor deem it necessary.
iled comments
Ticks
he authors mentioned, Tanaka and Takefushi (1993) described that louse eggs are picked off during
ming. But they did not write the monkeys were not infested by ticks. If the ticks on the body were NOT
oved as louse eggs, the tick bite may cause scratch among monkeys. Some primatologists may say it is
aginable because monkeys can remove everything on the body, and ticks must be picked if there are.
there is a report on the death of baboons caused by the tick infestation (Brain 1992).
e specialists of mammalogy may be difficult to image a mammal which are not infested by ticks. Ticks
not removed by Japanese monkeys, but they may infested.
nk it is better to describe the reason why ticks are not investigated in Introduction of this study. (e.g.
rences on the study of the lack of ticks in Kojima)
onse: We added a statement in the introduction pertaining to the fact that we focused on lice because
gesture sequence that we observed relates to removing louse eggs or imagoes, not ticks, because tick
oval was not observed, and ticks themselves seem very rare: “Ectoparasites known to infest Japanese
aques include two species of lice (Pedicinis obtusus and P. eurygaster) [30] and one species of tick
maphysalis longicornis) [31]. Lice and louse eggs are commonly observed on Japanese macaques
ng physical examination [30,31]. A previous study has shown that 98.9% of what individual macaques
out of the hair while grooming themselves or others, using a very conspicuous sequence of behaviour,
use eggs [30]. Ticks on the other hand are rarely found on Japanese macaques [30,31], and the
ural sequence of removing them when found differs from that of picking lice [30]. Fleas comprise
her group of common ectoparasites, but have not been reported to infest Japanese macaques [30,31].
s, most of what is known about ectoparasites of Japanese macaques involves lice.”, lines 99-108. The
that baboons, African savannah species, are susceptible to ticks does not help elucidate if Japanese
aques are but we do now refer to study of ticks in baboons to complement the references of studies on
in ungulates in the discussion, line 436.
ough we cannot exclude that there are ticks on Kojima, we never observed the behavioural sequence
ribed in Tanaka and Takefushi 1993 relating to a female picking up a tick from her infant. The same
ors clearly stated that: “(…) the handling of the tick differed from that of lice and lice eggs, because
nese macaques ate all of the eggs and imagoes of lice”. Zamma 2002 also reported that he observed
behaviour only once in the free-ranging population of Arashiyama. Tanaka and Takefushi 1993 and
ma 2002 reported only one case each of finding a tick whereas Zamma 2002 counted “160 louse eggs
68 nymphs or adult lice” on 8 monkeys. Zamma 2002 further estimated that a female may harbour up
50 louse eggs corresponding to half as much as adult biting lice. These two studies also did not report
ng, or observing fleas, which also bite and may trigger SDBs. Considering all this, while we do not mean
fer that ticks and other ectoparasites are inconsequential or non-existent in our study population, we
it is justified and indeed methodologically necessary to focus only on lice.
Two distances
derstand well that one of the variables are also based on the previous study.
onse: Thank you.
Mating
he authors’ response, there is a seasonality on mating of Japanese macaques. But not every females
e in mating season. For example, females who have infants do not show much in estrus. In this study,
data on estrous and anestrous females are pooled. In this case, season may not reflect the mating
ct.
ddition, four seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall) are investigated in this study, but the results is
ibly changed by investigating two seasons (mating season/ not mating season).
onse: The reviewer raises an important point here: it is true that although winter and summer are the
ng and birth seasons respectively, not all females will be reproductively active during those times.
hermore, a reproductively active female during the mating season may not become pregnant and thus
nactive during the birth season. To account for this, we reran the analyses by including reproductive
us of females (either active (cycling, pregnant, or lactating) or non-active) in models investigating the
ct of social variables. Results remain largely unchanged (we found no evidence to support an effect of
oduction and the previous results held) but have been modified now to account for this new variable
thods lines 265-270; results lines 335-340 mainly, and Tables 1-4).

nk the readers of Royal Society Open Science will judge the significance of this article by reading well-
sed Introduction and Methods. I also think the worth of this paper rises by the added variable
roductive status” that is directly related to the discussion (Line 413). However, I want to ask a question.
409-412: As the authors wrote, I think “Japanese macaque society is governed by strict rules following
inance and kinship relationships”. As I mentioned in the previous comments, kin-relationship is a key
or for SDB in the situation of post-conflict stress. However, the authors did not investigate kinship
ionship in this study. I want to ask why they did not describe the lack of key factor though they knew
mportance of kinship relationship. The authors wrote “Interestingly, social and environment factors had
weight in explaining variation in self-directed behaviors when compared to lice load”. I don’t think it is
esting. AIC may draw a biased conclusion when a key variable is excluded from the model. Anyway, I
not say that the lack of investigation is problem, as I wrote in the previous comments. It seems that
cussion” was not revised in this revision though “Introduction”, “Methods”, and “Results” were revised.
the authors forget to revise “Discussion”? I think the paper will be better if “the lack of key variable” is
ribed in it.
onse: First of all, while we admit having kin represented in our models would have been great, the
culty (as mentioned previously) is that over half of the females observed in this study had no detectable
n the group. This creates the problem that the presence of kin versus non-kin in proximity only works
alf of the study subjects, whereas for the other half we have structural zeroes, ie the lack of kin in
imity has nothing to do with behaviour and everything to do with family structure and demography on
sland. However, since we agree this is an important issue, we added the following in the discussion lines
-406: “For instance, Japanese macaque social behaviour is highly biased towards kin so that individuals
d often in proximity of each other are likely to be genetically related to some degree. Given that
rilines are rather small (between 2 and 4 adult females) and few (3) in the study group, larger numbers
male neighbours could be linked to the increased presence of non-kin in proximity which could be
ed to social uncertainty and bouts of self-grooming. Future studies could investigate the effect of the
ence of kin versus non-kin in relation to SDB when possible.” We also added that “social and
ronmental factors that we investigated had less weight” line 423 so as to stress that we can only draw
lusion for factors that have been taken into account.
rank of adult males are higher than that of adult females among Japanese macaques. I understand the
culty of investigation for males in Kojima, but if the lack of investigation affect the results, it should be
tioned in Discussion, because some previous studies considered male-female relationship as a kind of
inance relationship.)
onse: it would indeed be great to have data on additional individuals for a more complete investigation.
explained the various reasons for the limitations of our study already, in our previous response to
ewers as well as in the ms (lines 177-181: “We focused on females because in Kojima they form the
le core of the group and dominate dynamics of social networks, whereas males migrate between groups,
often few, peripheral and not very social, and juveniles are difficult to recognise and observe, and
lly engage in different age-typical activities than adults (note that intraspecific variation exists in
nese macaques’ social structure)”), and we do keep these comments in mind for future studies.

ments to the Author(s)
paper by Duboscq et al. aims to assess the effect of ectoparasite load as well as social and
ronmental factors on the occurrence of self-scratching and self-grooming. While previous studies have
ed at each of these factors separately, this paper is the first to examine them together, making the
uscript (and its conclusions) very interesting and relevant to a broad readership. Although I have not
ed at the previous versions of the draft myself, I believe that the authors have addressed the previous
ewer’s comments adequately. Even if I find the MS suitable for publications, I have some
tions/queries/comments myself:
n the introduction (lines 138-139) as well as in the methods (lines 265-270), the authors predict that
s should be higher under reproductive pressure (when cycling, pregnant and lactating). However, they
ot provide any rationale or cite any paper to justify this prediction. Firstly, what do the authors mean by
oductive pressure’? Furthermore, the authors lump together cycling, pregnant and lactating females,
it is unlikely that they all have to face the same constrains. Do cycling females in Japanese macaques
ive more attention from males and thus should be more anxious? Off the top of my head I can think of
a few papers that have looked at the effect of being in aestrous and stress/anxiety that the authors
ht want to consider for their paper: in ring-tailed lemurs, for instance, individuals scratch more during
high-swelling period than during the low-swelling period (Sclafani et al. 2012), while in chimpanzees,
ales experience higher levels of urinary cortisol when they are in oestrus than when non in oestrus
ler et al., 2007), although in this latter case the authors did not look at self-directed behaviours. In
rast, pregnant and lactating females face probably energetic costs. Moreover, in the methods the
ors do not mention how they assessed whether a female was cycling or not (i.e. sexual swelling?). This
mation might be useful in particular for researchers who are not familiar with Japanese macaques.
lly, the authors do not discuss the lack of effect of reproductive status on SDBs in the discussion, and I
k they should add a section in which they put these results in perspective.
onse: We thank the reviewer for this comment and the suggested papers. We added a sentence to
ain the rationale for the potential influence of reproductive state on SDB occurrence and cited the two
rences mentioned, lines 139-142 (Although it should be noted that there is a short explanation in the
hods lines 278-279 as well); we now explained shortly how we assess the female reproductive state,
186-190, and discuss the lack of effect of reproductive state on SDB occurrence lines 434-440.
n line 168 the authors should give more details on the provisioning of the monkeys. Currently, they
ide this information only in Table 1.
onse: we provided more information line 173.
n line 178-179, the authors should state how they selected the focal animal (i.e. using a predetermined
omized list?).
onse: we provided more information line 183.
ines 185-186. The authors state that they counted the number of louse egg-picking gestures, but they
ot mention in what context they count the gestures (i.e. during self-grooming or social grooming).
n that they mention this after talking about self-scratching events in line 186, it might sound like they
rded louse egg-picking behaviour during self-scratching, but later on (lines 194-196) the authors state
they counted louse egg-picking gesture during social grooming.
onse: We provide that information lines 203-205. Lines 194-196 (previously 185-186) only consist of
ribing which data and how they were collected as requested by a previous reviewer.
nes 207-211: there are models that can handle zero-inflated data sets with Poisson distribution. Have
authors considered this type of models? I believe that using actual count data, rather than a binary
able presence/absence might be more accurate, as it might reflect better the variation within and
een females in number of self-scratching and self-grooming bouts.
onse: We agree with the reviewer and ideally, we would have presented the suggested analyses. We
nally did carry out such analyses but we encountered several issues that made us switch to binomial
els: 1/ some models had repeatedly problems converging; 2/ the Poisson part of the data, that is any
r number than 0 and 1, represents 40% and 20% of the data for self-grooming and scratching
ectively, which is relatively moderate, even small, making the modelling of that part of the data
pared to the “binomial” one a bit unreliable; 3/ Given how limited the variation is above one scratching
elf-grooming event, we are confident that binomial models are accurate enough in modelling our data.
ines 215-216. Given that the aim of the work is to assess whether the occurrence of SDBs like self-
ming is linked to parasite load, I am wondering why the authors decided to measure parasite load by
g the amount of louse eggs removed during social grooming, as opposed to the amount of lice eggs
iduals removed during self-grooming. Given that during social grooming monkeys have the opportunity
move ectoparasites from body parts (like the back) from which it is not possible to remove
parasites during self-grooming (or self-scratching), I assume that the ectoparasite load that the authors
e calculated is an overestimation of the actual amount of ectoparasites individuals can remove through
grooming. If the authors do not have the data on the amount of ectoparasites removed during self-
ming, they should at least bring up this point in the discussion.
onse: We actually discussed this point much earlier on during manuscript preparation, and based on
e discussions we determined that using egg-picking gestures observed during self-grooming bouts only
ld be inadequate because: 1/ amongst the total louse-egg picking gestures we counted (=2282), 397 in
self-grooming minute-scans were recorded against 1885 in 5647 social grooming minute-scans (this
mation is now found lines 226-227), giving a total average lice load estimation of 0.41 and 0.33
ectively. So it would actually be an inaccurate overestimation of lice load to focus on louse-egg picking
ures only during self-grooming; 2/ body areas that are inaccessible for self-grooming like the back of
neck or shoulders can still be accessible for scratching; 3/ Yes, individuals cannot remove all their
parasites through self-grooming and scratching, and that is partly why they socially groom (see Zamma
2 Primates). Lice move through the hair of their host and may still at some point or another be present
body area where they can be preyed upon. Monkeys have been shown to groom those body areas more
y to be more infested with lice (Zamma 2002 Primates)
chose to have an overall estimation of lice load as we are interested in general patterns and we are
stigating another SDB in addition of self-grooming that can target body areas that are inaccessible and
ntially highly infested.
ome of the models that the authors build up have a large number of independent variables (the
grated model has 12 variables): have the authors checked for colinearity among these variables before
ding them in the model? I assume that aggression received during focal might be correlated to the
ession received during ad libitum observations, or rank with aggression received (as the authors state in
232-233), or temperature with season.
onse: we agree with the assumptions of the reviewer and we were careful to examine this possibility
found that we had no problem of collinearity. We provide information on the VIF line 304 in the
hods.
n the supplementary material (the dataset) the authors should spell out more clearly what the different
mns represent (trying to avoid usingthe use of abbreviations, or giving a legend to explain what the
eviations stand for).
onse: thank you for this suggestion, we made the recommended changes.
