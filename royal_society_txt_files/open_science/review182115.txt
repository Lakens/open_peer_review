the end statements for reference. If you feel that a given heading is not relevant to your paper,
please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
4
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication, you will be
asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is approved by
Royal Society Publishing. You can find out more about the charges at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please
contact openscience@royalsociety.org.

Comments to the Author:
This manuscript quantified thermal tolerance in a copepod, and the effects of genetics, sex, and
developmental plasticity on thermal tolerance. This represents a substantial amount of work
(even if it compares only two populations). I urge the authors to place this work in a broader
context, and give a flavor for the complexity involved in this problem (of which they illuminated
two - genetic variation, and plasticity). From the rebuttal to BioLett, I gather this indeed was the
intent of the authors, so I was left wondering why the problem was given such a biased
treatment.
Specific comments:
L71. Some more info about the species would be useful. Basic life history and cycle. Size of the
sexes etc.
L82. Refer to the table showing these values.
L82. Define shallow. The following qualifying sentence implies that shallow enough that thermal
stratification doesn't occur?
L87. unnecessary to open the drift can of worms...no data is presented to test it, better leave it out.
Just give ranges (instead of >1500).
L88. Need more info on common garden. What media was used? How were algae grown? How
much algae was fed? How often?
L88. what is psu?
L97. How was mortality verified?
L99. How many from each site? xFL + yCT= 1717. Rationalize the imbalance in sample size.
L100. I am surprised size wasn't included here. Given temperature-size rule and Bergman's rule
potentially impacting size between sites, and associated size-dependent effects on fitness-relevant
traits such as fecundity. If size differences were negligible between sites, that should be
supported by data (I'd think FL will be smaller than CT - which would make the result of higher
thermal tolerance even more impressive!). Regardless, this size issue needs to be
5
addressed/acknowledged somewhere in the ms. It doesn't take away from the study, only makes
it more complete in my opinion.
L160. This may be true as the ultimate consequence, but there are several proximate alternatives
the authors could discuss.
L190. Agree with the conclusion/recommendation. However, this manuscript, as written, seems
to do the opposite (i.e. focus on only a few mechanisms for which the authors collected data).
That's fine, but to be fair to readers, a broader discussion of other variables/mechanisms would
improve the paper. Size (see above). Food quantity and quality (wouldn't FL have higher primary
production than CT?), perhaps nullifying the observed effects in the lab (where food was
constant) - i.e. higher energetic intake may help them mitigate thermal stress for longer. These
sort of issues can be discussed in RSOS with more space compared to BioLett, and I encourage
the authors to consider.
I look forward to a fresh version to make a final decision.

The reviewer was right in asking for a more well-balanced coverage, but the assumption
patterns in primary productivity between sites could explain patterns does not apply for
reasons. I) Our common garden experimental design should remove any direct effects of
ering amounts of primary productivity between sites. II) Primary productivity is actually
er in CT than in FL, rather than vice versa. Any remnant environmental acclimation might
refore have the opposite effect from what the reviewer suggested (it would decrease
rmal tolerance in the FL population, not the CT population).
