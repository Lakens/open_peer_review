The paper reported the synthesis of mesoporous ZSM-5 and its use in MTP. It is an important
topic in both zeolite synthesis and catalysis. The data well supported part of the conclusion.
However, an important issue must be concluded in the revised manuscript:
The author mentioned "excellent MTP catalyst" and "great mesoporosity". How they make their

mesoporous zeolite and catalyst for MTP reaction. If the catalyst in this work overcomes the

Response:
Recently, Rui Feng et al. have synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites by a two-stage
crystallization method using glucose as a second template [1]. The as-obtained samples were used
as catalysts in MTP reaction, and the highest propylene selectivity was 45.2% and the propylene
to ethylene ratio was 8.4 as well as the selectivity of C2-C4 was 63.9% as shown in Table. R1. As
comparison, in our paper, the optimal propylene selectivity was 43.4% and the propylene to
ethylene ratio was 8.9, and the selectivity of C2-C4 was 74.75% as presented in the Supplementary
Information (Table. 1S).
Table. R1 The results of the MTP reaction in reference [1].
However, the most important was that the WHSV of methanol in our paper was set as 6 h-1
compared with that of only 3.8 h 1 in [1], and it was common that the higher WHSV of methanol
-
caused quicker coke deposition and resulted in shorter lifetime of catalysts in fixed bed reactor.
The industrial WHSV of methanol always lower than 2 h-1. In addition, the conversion of
methanol over the optimal sample of ZSM-5-T3 in [1] quickly dropped to ~ 95% after the reaction
proceeding only for 3 h as shown in Fig. R1 (left). In contrary, the lifetime of SMZ-3 obtained in
our paper was ~ 180 h with conversion of methanol above 95%, nearly 60 times higher of SMZ-3
than ZSM-5-T3.

Fig. R1. The MTP reaction over ZSM-5-T3 [1] (left) and SMZ-3 in manuscript (right).
The primary reason for such a large difference in lifetime of catalysts could be attributed to
the pore properties and the morphology of particles, which greatly influenced the mass diffusion
and the ability of coke tolerance in crystals.
Table. R2 Pore parameters of the catalysts in reference [1].
As shown in Table. R2, the pore parameters of the optimal sample of ZSM-5-T3 in [1]
exhibited not only poor microporosity (Smicro=157 m2/g) but also poor mesoporosity (Smeso=143
m2/g), however, the sample of SMZ-3 possessed 332 m2/g of Smicr and 463 m2/g of Smeso as shown
in Table. R3 (part of Table. 1 in manuscript). Therefore, the SBET of SMZ-3 was about 2.6 times
larger than that of ZSM-5-T3.
Table. R3 The pore parameters of CZ and SMZ-3 in our manuscript.

CZ 384 330 54 0.14 0.18
SMZ-3 795 332 463 0.14 0.8
The influence of morphology of particles on the lifetime of catalyst could further be
demonstrated by the images of ZSM-5-T3 as displayed in Fig. R2 (A-B), which were similar to
the conventional ZSM-5 zeolite in (C-D), all presenting coffin-like large particles of smooth
appearance. This morphology of poor mesoporosity limited the molecule diffusion in crystals
seriously and the mainly microporous structure resulted in quickly blocking of pores due to coke
deposition. On the contrary, the morphology of SMZ-3 in our manuscript as shown in Fig. R3
exhibited a distinct aggregation structure of nanocrystals, which benefited the formation of
intra-/inter-crystalline mesopores, helping to improve the ability of coke tolerance of the catalysts.

conventional ZSM-5 zeolite (C-D).
Fig. R3. The SEM images of SMZ-3 as shown in our manuscript.
Compared to the reference [1], similar results also could be found in recently state-of-the-art
literature [2, 3, 4, 5], which exhibited a less-than-perfect lifetime of catalyst with
conventional-like morphology in condition of low WHSV of methanol.
Hengbao Chen et al. reported a synthesis method of aggregates of superfine ZSM-5 crystals
as catalysts in MTP reaction [6]. A similar morphology of particles and almost the similar
excellent lifetime of catalyst have been presented compared to our work, however, the MTP
reaction in [6] was also conducted with the WHSV of methanol of only 2 h-1 and the largest
mesoporous surface area in [6] was 232 m2/g, lower than that of SMZ-3.
Fig. R4. SEM images of (a) Z5-0.05C and (b) Z5-0.1C in [7].
And they have also synthesized aggregates of nano-sized ZSM-5 crystals used in MTP
reaction by a method of seed-induced in presence of MFI seeds and cetyltrimethyl ammonium
bromide (CTAB) [7]. The morphology of catalysts exhibited a similar aggregation structure as
shown in Fig. R4, however, the optimal catalyst performed in MTP reaction exhibited lifetime of
just 42 h (95% conversion of methanol) with propylene selectivity of 41.1 %, and the Smicro and
Sext were just 172 and 242 m2/g respectively.
Therefore, in comparison with the newly reported works, the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites as
obtained in this paper have displayed great mesopore properties, and the excellent catalytic
performance (good propylene selectivity and outstanding lifetime of catalyst in condition of high
WHSV of methanol) has a positive relationship with the morphology and pore parameters of
catalysts in MTP reaction.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript is devoted to synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with great mesoporosity,
and the samples were utilized as catalysts in the reaction of methanol to propylene (MTP). These
results are interesting to some extent, however, the mechanism of both of synthesis reaction of
ZSM-5 zeolites with mesoporosity, and the catalysts of MTP are absent. The manuscript should be
rejected.

Fig. 1S The FTIR spectrum of OPA.
The FTIR spectrum of OPA showed the disappearances of the absorption bands at 900 cm-1
and 3500-3300 cm-1, which could be assigned to the epoxy groups in the (3-glycidoxypropyl)
trimethoxysilane and the amino groups in the amino-terminated polyoxypropylene (D230,
C11H24N2O3, 232), respectively. This FTIR result confirmed that the epoxide ring open to form
hydrolytically stable C-N bonds with the amino groups showed in Equation. 1, and consequently
obtained the OPA product.
Fig. 2S The 1H NMR of OPA.
The 1H NMR spectrum is performed to characterize the structure of OPA. The spectra
exhibits main resonances at 3.3-3.8 ppm and 4.5-5.0 ppm, verifying the presence of H-C-O
(CH3-O-, CH2-O-, and CH-O-) and H-O-C (HO-CH-, attributed to the epoxide ring open),
respectively. Moreover, three distinguishable resonances at 0.5-0.9 ppm, 1.5-1.9 ppm and 2.2-2.9
ppm appear in the 1H NMR spectrum, which can be assigned to (H-C-C), (H-C-Si) and (H-C-N-R)
respectively.
Fig. 3S The 13C NMR of OPA.
The 13C NMR spectrum is also employed to characterize the structure of OPA. The spectra
presents main resonances at 13-25 ppm, 47-60 ppm, and 67-77 ppm, indicating respectively the
presence of (C-CH2-), (R-C-O- and R-C-N-) and (C-O-). These results from FTIR and NMR
analysis further demonstrate that the structure of OPA as-synthesized was coincided with the
Equation. 1.
3. The mechanism of the effect of OPA on the synthesis reaction of ZSM-5 zeolites with
mesoporosity should be given.
Response:
The mechanism of the synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites in presence of OPA has been
proposed in Fig. 10 in revised manuscript as required, where the connection mode between OPA
molecules and MFI framework was illustrated. After the hydrolysis of methoxy, the groups of
-Si-OH in OPA molecules reacted with the groups of -Si-OH distributed over appearance of
zeolite precursors in condensation. According to the rules of atom coordination in zeolite
frameworks, Al atoms could not connect with Al to form -Al-O-Al-, and Si atoms could connect
with either Al or Si atoms to form -Si-O-Al- or -Si-O-Si-, and therefore, the covalent bonds of
-Si-O-Si- formed as shown in the inset of Fig. 10. Meanwhile, as a stable fraction, the OPA
molecules experienced the high temperature crystallization process with zeolite precursors. After
crystallization, the mesoporogen OPA could be removed from the frameworks of zeolites by
calcination and the mesopore channels were uniformly distributed in crystals.
Fig. 10. The mechanism of the synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites in presence of OPA.
4. The catalysis mechanism of MTP using the SMZ and TMZ samples as catalysts should be
given.
Response:
Because an enormous amount of products and intermediates have been produced in the
process, it was conceived to be very complicated to investigate the mechanism of MTP reaction
[1]. According to the difference of intermediate products [2, 3], the various mechanisms which
have been raised could be summarized as direct and indirect routes respectively, and the latter one
has received wide acceptance [3].
The most significant difference between direct and indirect routes was that the light olefins
were assumed to be produced over the active sites in the micropores of zeolites with the indirect
process [2].
Scheme 1. Proposed hydrocarbon pool mechanism [4].
And the scheme 1 illustrated the important hydrocarbon pool mechanism of indirect route [5],
where C-C bond formed through the reaction of methanol with the organic hydrocarbon pool, and
the light olefins also could be reproduced by higher olefins contrarily with the method of
autocatalysis [4, 6-10] where the polymethylbenzenes and other derivatives which were trapped in
micropores have been considered to be the co-catalysts in production of olefins [6].
Scheme 2. Proposed dual-cycle catalytic mechanism over H-ZSM-5 [11].
In addition, the scheme 2 proposed a dual cycle catalytic mechanism, which revealed that the
ethylene and propylene were formed in different catalytic routes [11, 12]. The olefin-based route
which preferred to produce propylene has been raised over high silica MFI catalyst in MTP
process [13].
Scheme 3. Paring and side-chain methylation pathways for propylene formation over H-ZSM-5[14].
The another route was based on aromatics, which could be further divided into two different
mechanisms, side-chain methylation and paring approach as shown in Scheme 3 [14]. The alkyl
chains which were cyclic methylated and eliminated over aromatic compounds finally transformed
to light olefins with the mechanism of side-chain methylation. In contrary, the light olefins was
formed as a result of constriction and cracking of benzenium-ions with paring approach [14]. And
the mechanism of MTP reaction is still being developed and proposed continuously.

1. As a work about the MTP, there is none introduction about the advance of methanol
conversion process, if a small section about methanol conversion is added, it will be more
perfect.
Response:
We have introduced a content about the advance of methanol conversion process in part of
Introduction as required. And the added contents are as flows:
As the development of petrochemical industry, propylene has been utilized as a feed stock to
produce various of polymer and chemical intermediates [1]. However, due to the great demand of
propylene, a new process should be developed to supplement the increasing needs of propylene
which was produced by the method of petroleum cracking conventionally [2].
Because of the more accessible and economical of methanol [3], the process of
methanol-to-propylene (MTP) developed by Lurgi has received great attentions [4]. As an efficient
route to produce propylene, the most crucial step of the MTP reaction was to optimize the
production of olefins which was influenced by the pore properties and the acidity of catalysts to
some extent.
Thanks to the three-dimensional frameworks and accessible acidity, zeolites have been
employed as the heterogeneous catalysts in MTP reaction in many papers [1, 3], and from which
the high silica H-ZSM-5 zeolite was recognized as the most suitable catalyst for MTP process [5].
The topology of MFI (ZSM-5) is also a three-dimensional frameworks consisted of two 10 ring
channels, where the straight channels (5.1-5.5 Å) are cross connected with the zigzag channels
(5.3-5.6 Å) [6].
Although various patents have focused their work on higher selectivity of propylene [7-9], the
selectivity of propylene and the propylene/ethylene (P/E) ratio in MTP process catalyzed by
conventional ZSM-5 zeolites were still very low. And among the many factors, the properties of
zeolite catalysts (channel structure, acidity and crystal size) have been believed to influence the
catalytic performance largely [10].
Thus, it is of extremely important significance to modify and develop an efficient ZSM-5
zeolite catalyst in MTP process, where outstanding lifetime of catalysts and superior conversion of
methanol and great selectivity of propylene can be obtained [11].

2. Please supply the SEM image of CZ.
Response:
We have supplied the SEM images of CZ in Fig. 6 (E-F) as shown in revised manuscript.
3. In my opinion, if the chemical structure of Formula.1 show in simple style(draw by
Chemoffice) will make it easier to understand.
Response:
We have revised the Formula. 1 instead of a chemical equation as required. And the Equation. 1 in
revised manuscript is illustrated as flow:
Equation. 1. Fabrication method of OPA.
4. The SMZ-3 has largest SBET, it must be more acid sites in the external surface( (strong
acid)), why the strong acid is less than the CZ sample.
Response:
As shown in Fig. 9 in manuscript, the peak located at high temperature regions represent the
strong acid sites related to the Al atoms [1-3]. Although the same SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios
compared to CZ, the amounts of the strong acid sites of these SMZ samples were less than that of
CZ. And decreased strong acidity of samples with the same or even low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios also
could be observed in literature [3], which should be ascribed to the inaccessibility for some Al
species on the closed pores or cages, causing the existence of extra-framework Al. In addition,
considerable less amounts of whether weak or strong acid sites were detected in SMZ samples,
which could result from the more versatile pool of surface acid sites [4] and the nanosized crystal
domains [5] as well, indicating that the degree of nanosized of the hierarchical samples might have
direct impact on the strong acid sites.
Thus, besides the relationship with the surface area of the samples, the amounts of strong
acid sites in the external surface had close ties with the content of Al on frameworks of zeolite and
the amounts of accessible Al species as well. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the morphology
or structure of the hierarchical zeolites and the particle size of the crystal domains also had great
influence on the amounts of strong acid sites.
Therefore, although the SMZ-3 has the largest SBET, the distinctly aggregation structure of
SMZ-3 with nanosized crystal domains also resulted in the decrease of the amounts of strong acid
sites in external surface.

5. How did you sample during the catalyst text?
Response:
Before testing, the H-form hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts were sampled in process of pressing
at 5 tons for 10 min and crushing and sieving to 40-60 mesh particles. We have added this process
in revised manuscript as required.
