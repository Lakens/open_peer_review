Dear Authors;
First of all, I would like to say that the authors have used biotin drug as a corrosion inhibitor for
mild steel in 15% HCl. But I have to say that, according to research I have done, inhibitor
efficiency and theoretical studies have been done in 240 ppm aqueous chloride medium.
Mentioned article is given below.
• Aloysius et al., Experimental and theoretical studies on the corrosion inhibition of vitamins –
Thiamine hydrochloride or biotin in corrosion of mild steel in aqueous chloride environment,
Egypt. J. Petrol. (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpe.2017.06.003
So, the innovation of this study is just a change of medium. Is it enough to publish this
manuscript?
the deficiencies that need to be corrected are:
1) It would be better to say that biotin is a vitamin (H or B7 vitamins) in the brief biotin-related
information in introduction section.
2) Why is the 15% HCl medium chosen especially when the acidic medium is chosen???? Would
not it be inconvenient to work in such a concentrated acidic environment??? Cannot the drug
break up????
3) I think, it is good to have a lot of articles but it is better to refer other people too. I do not find it
very ethical for constant authors to refer to themselves.
4) It would be better to comment if the authors give the actual % inhibition efficiency values
instead of Figure 3 in a separate table.
5) Especially the thermodynamic calculations of the study must be re-examined. Table 2 shows
that <U+0394>H, <U+0394>S and Ea are calculated for a single temperature value. So the comment remains
superficial. Whereas the interpretation of transition states will change with increasing
temperature. This will be more accurate.
6) On page 10, in line 3, Authors have said that Biotin is adsorbed both chemically and physically
(mixed adsorption). The calculated <U+0394>G values are not very close to -40 kJ / mol or more than -40
kJ / mol. Chemical adsorption is not right here. It should be corrected. Why <U+0394>G is not calculated
for each concentration.
7) Nyquist plots comments in Figure 7a are inadequate and should be improved. Furthermore,
the EIS and potentiodynamic polarization measurement results are not interpreted relative to
each other. In terms of integrity of manuscript, this must be done absolutely.
8) On page 13, in line 3, Authors have said that the values of ßc changed significantly with
increasing Biotin concentrations. I think this result should be re-examined carefully. ßc values
are not very different from the blank in Table 5. It would be more accurate to say that the
inhibitor is not affected by the hydrogen reduction mechanism.
9) How long were the electrodes held in solution before SEM analysis? It is required.
10) How does the calculated Fukui indices of nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks on the affect
3
the corrosion process? It will be better if you comment on it.
11) On page 18, in line 2, Authors have said that “Consistent results were obtained from weight
loss, electrochemical impedance and polarization measurements”. But three measurement results
were not compared with each other.
12) On page 18, in line 10, Authors have said that “Quantum chemical calculations also
supported the experimental findings”. No comment has been made in this text.
With best regards.

label_comment_2
The manuscript by Ambrish Singh and co-workers reports on a study on the effects of biotin as a
corrosion inhibitor for steel in acidic solutions, by means of a wide range of techniques.
From their observations, the authors conclude that biotin can indeed act as a mixed inhibitor. An
attempt to explain this behaviour is made through the derivation of thermodynamic parameters
and quantum chemical calculations, however a mechanism through which biotin acts, or an
adsorption model, are not explicitly proposed. In fact, the manuscript concentrates on results, but
lacks of a more thorough data discussion (a few suggestions below).
Overall, this manuscript is well-written, even though every now and then some articles and
prepositions are missing. This doesn't diminish its contents, but requires a more careful editing.
I do recommend publication, after a few minor issues are addressed. Please see below, itemised
following images, but changes in the related text may be required.
Minor points:
- I find a little amusing the use of stars to indicate data points; this is fine, but error bars seem to
be missing form many graphs? These will help in being more quantitative. Regarding axes labels
/units: please be consistent in the format. Use "label /unit" or "label (unit)", not a mix of both.
4
- Figure 2: Shouldn't a (0,0) point to be included (i.e. no inhibitor, no efficiency)?
- Figure 3: what is the concentration of biotin used? Is it the 500 ppm reported in Table2? Was this
evaluated also for the other concentrations, or only for blank and 500 ppm? Text might also need
to be integrated.
- Figure 4: again, specify biotin concentration.
- Figure 5: figure caption refers to plots, but only one curve is shown. Is this correct?
- Figure 6: aspect ratio is all distorted. Use correct unit for time in x-axis.
- Figure 7: also here there seem to be some stretching of the figure; please check labels in (b) y-
axis.
- Figure 10: SECM images: It is not clear what the axes labels are and what they mean. If a 3D
image of the surface is obtained, can the authors extract more info, like a surface roughness?
- Figure 11: SEM images: Any possibility to estimate the surface roughness? How does the surface
roughness compare with the other scanning techniques?
- Figure 12: AFM images: please used the correct symbol in units. A more quantitative way to
describe the difference between the images (with/without inhibitor) is the use of surface
roughness values/histograms. I encourage the authors to produce them and include them.
- Figure 13: More clarity is needed. (b): is the extra proton on 9N or 12N? The authors should use
the same nomenclature also in the text, rather than referring to N(a) and N(b), page 16, lines 18
and 34, correlation with Table 7, I guess.
- Regarding the quantum chemical calculations: how did the authors include the solvation and
the 15% HCl? This is not specified in paragraph 2.4 (page 6). This is crucial, as solvation factors
will influence the HOMO-LUMO gaps, the protonation of the molecule and its ability to adsorb
(both physically and chemically) on the steel surface.
- Table 6: are the energies calculated in water/ 15% HCl, or in the gas phase? What units? The
values should be compared to the work function of steel, if this is possible at all, or discussed
otherwise.

Dear Author(s);
I have reviewed the revised manuscript. I see that most of the mistakes I have criticized have
been corrected. When compared to the old version of manuscript, only 3 new references have
been added. Apart from these, no source has been specified in the section where Fukui indexes
exist. If the authors wish, I would like to suggest a reference such as…………

chemical aspects. Corrosion Science, 2012, 56, 143-152. Doi: 10.1016/j.corsci.2011.11.010.
Finally, I would like to underline that when we look at the references section, the repeated
references in the text are striking. Correction of these will be important for the quality of the
journal. For example, references [7] and [38] and references [54] and [62] have been repeated. It
must definitely be corrected. Lastly, the way in which references are written should also be
glanced. In most references the primary names have not been shortened. As a result of this, I am

mment 5: Especially the thermodynamic calculations of the study must be re-examined.
le 2 shows that <U+0394>H, <U+0394>S and Ea are calculated for a single temperature value. So the comment
ains superficial. Whereas the interpretation of transition states will change with increasing

calculated for each concentration.
ponse 6: On page 10, in line 3, the statement regarding <U+0394>G has been corrected and changed
hysical adsorption. Best performance of inhibitor takes place at 500 ppm so all
rmodynamics calculations have been done at this concentration.
mment 7: Nyquist plots comments in Figure 7a are inadequate and should be improved.
thermore, the EIS and potentiodynamic polarization measurement results are not interpreted

ponse 7: Nyquist plots have been corrected with the improved image quality. The EIS and
entiodynamic polarization measurement results are discussed again.
mment 8: On page 13, in line 3, Authors have said that the values of ßc changed significantly
h increasing Biotin concentrations. I think this result should be re-examined carefully. ßc
ues are not very different from the blank in Table 5. It would be more accurate to say that the
ibitor is not affected by the hydrogen reduction mechanism.
ponse 8: The ßc values are discussed again and the mistake has been rectified as per your

ponse: The error bars have been added in the figures. Axes labels have been corrected with

mment: Figure 2: Shouldn't a (0,0) point to be included (i.e. no inhibitor, no efficiency)?
ponse: Figure 2a and b represents effect of concentration on inhibition efficiency. So, I think
re is no need to add a (0,0) point because these figures obtained only in presence of inhibitor.

t might also need to be integrated.
ponse: The concentration of biotin used for plotting figure 3 is 500 ppm.Yes, it is 500 ppm
eported in Table 2 (now table 3). It is evaluated only for blank and 500 ppm concentration.
mment: Figure 4: again, specify biotin concentration.
ponse: For obtaining figure 4, 500 ppm inhibitor concentration has been used.
mment: Figure 5: figure caption refers to plots, but only one curve is shown. Is this correct?
ponse: In figure all other plots like Freundlich, Temkin, and Flory- Huggins has been added.
mment: Figure 6: aspect ratio is all distorted. Use correct unit for time in x-axis.
ponse: Figure 6 has been redrawn with better resolution. The unit for time in x-axis has been
rected.
mment: Figure 7: also here there seem to be some stretching of the figure; please check labels
b) y-axis.
ponse: Figure 7 has been redrawn with better resolution.
mment: Figure 10: SECM images: It is not clear what the axes labels are and what they
an. If a 3D image of the surface is obtained, can the authors extract more info, like a surface
ghness?
ponse: The axes labels represent the current and distance of the probe from the surface. So
can observe a difference in current of a blank and inhibited sample due to conductive and
uctive effect. SECM is not known to produce much information about the surface roughness.
mment: Figure 11: SEM images: Any possibility to estimate the surface roughness? How
s the surface roughness compare with the other scanning techniques?
ponse: The surface roughness was visually compared.
mment: Figure 12: AFM images: please used the correct symbol in units. A more quantitative
y to describe the difference between the images (with/without inhibitor) is the use of surface
ghness values/histograms. I encourage the authors to produce them and include them.
ponse: The correct symbol has been used. Some other parameters of surface roughness have
n added.
mment: Figure 13: More clarity is needed. (b): is the extra proton on 9N or 12N? The authors
uld use the same nomenclature also in the text, rather than referring to N(a) and N(b), page
lines 18 and 34, correlation with Table 7, I guess.
ponse: The position of extra proton has been corrected in the manuscript.
mment: Regarding the quantum chemical calculations: how did the authors include the
vation and the 15% HCl? This is not specified in paragraph 2.4 (page 6). This is crucial, as
vation factors will influence the HOMO-LUMO gaps, the protonation of the molecule and its
ity to adsorb (both physically and chemically) on the steel surface.
ponse: All quantum chemical calculation has been carried out in only aqueous phase and
cified in the manuscript.
mment: Table 6: are the energies calculated in water/ 15% HCl, or in the gas phase? What
ts? The values should be compared to the work function of steel, if this is possible at all, or
cussed otherwise.
ponse: In Table 6 (now Table 8) the energies has been calculated in water phase and there
ts has been added. The values of HOMO and LUMO have been compared with work function
teel.

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Author(s);
<U+F0D8> I have reviewed the revised manuscript. I see that most of the mistakes I
have criticized have been corrected. When compared to the old version of
manuscript, only 3 new references have been added. Apart from these, no
source has been specified in the section where Fukui indexes exist. If the
authors wish, I would like to suggest a reference such as…………
<U+F0D8> D. Özkir, K. Kayakirilmaz, E. Bayol, A.A. Gürten, F. Kandemirli, The
inhibition effect of Azure A on mild Steel in 1 M HCl. A complete study:
Adsorption, temperature duration and quantum chemical aspects. Corrosion
Science, 2012, 56, 143-152. Doi: 10.1016/j.corsci.2011.11.010.
Author’s Response: We have added this reference in the manuscript.
<U+F0D8> Finally, I would like to underline that when we look at the references section,
the repeated references in the text are striking. Correction of these will be
important for the quality of the journal. For example, references [7] and [38]
and references [54] and [62] have been repeated. It must definitely be
corrected. Lastly, the way in which references are written should also be
glanced. In most references the primary names have not been shortened. As a
result of this, I am convinced that this revised manuscript can be published in
journal.
Author’s Response: We have corrected these references and primary names in the
manuscript.
