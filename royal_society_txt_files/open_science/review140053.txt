This article is well written and addresses a very important topic relating to saltwater intrusion
and its' effects on freshwater aquatic macrophytes. The methods used are all reasonable and the
conclusions sound. I made minor edits on the attached pdf copy. The only major problem that I
found was the references to each figure and table. Many of the figures and tables were
mislabeled in the text. The authors need to thoroughly review and change these labels or the
order of the figures and tables. Specific comments are on the pdf copy. My recommendation is to
publish this article once the corrections are made.

Pag 4 line111-112, this sentence need a referrence
In Methods, why was the salinity 18 ppt? What is the relationship between the concentration
and the field condition in which the plants exist? why was the salinity in the second pulse not 18
ppt?
how many times were the plants harvested? I ask for this because authors tried to prove that
potential recovery from the initial salinity pulse treatment, if they can compared the parameters
after initial salinity pulse and the final harvest will prove this conclude adequately.
In Results, the notes of figures and tables are not consistent with the actual figures and tables,
such as, pag 11 line 248, Table2 seems to be Table3; line 256 Fig. 1A&B; pag6 line 152, Table1
seems to be Table2, a lot , I will not list everyone.
Pag 12 line 277, this conclusion can not be proved soundly here.
I think three replicates are fewer.
In general, the discussion is very long and could be halved in length to include the pertinent
points, following reanalysis of the data. Such as pag 15 line 336-247 , and the description of Fig. 5
should be present in results part. Also, a lot of mention is made to discuss the relationship
between this paper and others, different experiments and methods can get different results, )
authors should pay more attention to explaining the results and discussing the aims mentioned in

introduction and also put these results in the bigger picture of restoring and managing the
estuarine ecosystems.

label_comment_3
The revised manuscript is improved, but there is a problem. Line 275—279 authors found the
biomass in 1-pulse, low nutrient treatments was higher than in 2-pulse, low nutrient treatment,
therefore, they considered “some potential recovery from the initial salinity pulse treatment by
final harvest”. However, the conclusion is unconvincing, if the plants can’t recover from the first
salinity pulse treatment, after being exposed to second salinity pulse treatment, the second
salinity pulse treatment maybe further reduce the biomass of plants, which also caused “ biomass
in 1-pulse, low nutrient treatments was higher than in 2-pulse, low nutrient treatment ”, in fact,
authors had reported 2 salinity pulse can cause higher mortality of plants than 1 salinity pulse in
previous text . Meanwhile, I find the mean biomass in 1-pulse, control treatment was similar to
the mean biomass in 2-pulse, control treatment, why did the plants in 1-pulse, control treatment
5
not recover from salinity pulse? In my opinion, these words should be deleted here, but authors
can discuss them in discussion part.
My recommendation is to publish this article when the problems mentioned above are solved .

Authors' response to reviewers' comments
See Appendix B.
pendix A
hors Response to Reviewers/Referees
authors would like to thank the referees for their time in reviewing this work. We greatly
reciate their time and effort
iewer: 1
article is well written and addresses a very important topic relating to saltwater intrusion
its' effects on freshwater aquatic macrophytes. The methods used are all reasonable and
conclusions sound. I made minor edits on the attached pdf copy.
hor Response: We went through the revisions and made all the changes as suggested. One
g we did not change after some reflection was to hyphenate the words aboveground and
owground biomass. We have published the words like this in the past and would prefer to
p the spelling as we have seen it one numerous other related articles. However, if the
or thinks otherwise, we would be obliged to change it.
only major problem that I found was the references to each figure and table. Many of the
res and tables were mislabeled in the text. The authors need to thoroughly review and
nge these labels or the order of the figures and tables.
hor Response: So very sorry for this error on our part. We overlooked this on our
mission and appreciate the willingness by both reviewers to see through this mistake and
ectively review the work, despite the mislabeling. We have made all of the appropriate
rections.
cific comments are on the pdf copy. My recommendation is to publish this article once the
rections are made.
hor Response: Specific comments on document was very helpful. Thank you for your time
attention to detail.
iewer: 2
4 line111-112, this sentence need a reference.
hor Response: We added appropriate citations in reference to the sentence.
ethods, why was the salinity 18 ppt?
hor Response:We added a sentence indicating that 18 ppt salinity used in the experiment
the upper limit determined by the SJR Water Management District to be used in the
eriments.
at is the relationship between the concentration and the field condition in which the plants
t?
hor Response: Again here, we added a clarifying language in the methods to help avoid
fusion on the select parameters of the experiment. We made it clear that much of the
ameters were provided by the District to answer specific questions necessary for
ancement in their management of the river system.
y was the salinity in the second pulse not 18 ppt?
hor Response: We added the following to clarify: “We used 12 ppt on the second pulse to
erentiate the two-pulse treatments from the initial 18 ppt single-pulse treatment. “
many times were the plants harvested? I ask for this because authors tried to prove that
ential recovery from the initial salinity pulse treatment, if they can compared the
ameters after initial salinity pulse and the final harvest will prove this conclude adequately.
hor Response: We are clear in the methods that there were two harvests reported –
treatment to establish baseline conditions and final harvest. Not sure what is confusing but
ay be that we discuss the impact to the plants observed following the first salinity pulse;
ever, the final harvest did show some differences in those plants receiving 1 pulse and 2
se.
esults, the notes of figures and tables are not consistent with the actual figures and tables,
h as, pag 11 line 248, Table2 seems to be Table3; line 256 Fig. 1A&B; pag6 line 152, Table1
ms to be Table2, a lot , I will not list everyone.
hor Response: Again we apologize for this and have made these corrections.
12 line 277, this conclusion cannot be proved soundly here.
nk three replicates are fewer.
hor Response: not sure what is being referred to here. We are stating a factual observance
t the means of all 1-pulse low nutrients are higher in all three measurements.
eneral, the discussion is very long and could be halved in length to include the pertinent
nts, following reanalysis of the data. Such as pag 15 line 336-247 , and the description of Fig.
ould be present in results part.
hor Response: We provide this information in a discussion format that we felt was more
ropriate in this section because it allows for more latitude in making observations. In
eral, we had certain points that we felt were relevant and informative based upon our
eriences in the study that would shed light on uncertainties of this species environmental
ts. Figure 5 was included here for the purpose of supporting our discussion in this context.
o, a lot of mention is made to discuss the relationship between this paper and others,
erent experiments and methods can get different results,) authors should pay more
ntion to explaining the results and discussing the aims mentioned in introduction and also
these results in the bigger picture of restoring and managing the estuarine ecosystems.
hor Response: There has been much discussion by managers and researchers on the
ironmental tolerances of this particular species because of its ecological importance to
e of the major estuaries in the United States including the Chesapeake Bay, East Coast of
ida, and the Gulf Coast. The discussion reviews these studies to properly place this current
k in the context of the body of work done over the past two decades. We certainly hope to
overwhelm the reader or lull into disinterest but we felt it appropriate and would prefer to
vide a little more information than not enough in this particular subject.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The revised manuscript is improved, but there is a problem. Line 275—279
authors found the biomass in 1-pulse, low nutrient treatments was higher
than in 2-pulse, low nutrient treatment, therefore, they considered “some
potential recovery from the initial salinity pulse treatment by final harvest”.
However, the conclusion is unconvincing, if the plants can’t recover from the
first salinity pulse treatment, after being exposed to second salinity pulse
treatment, the second salinity pulse treatment maybe further reduce the
biomass of plants, which also caused “ biomass in 1-pulse, low nutrient
treatments was higher than in 2-pulse, low nutrient treatment ”, in fact,
authors had reported 2 salinity pulse can cause higher mortality of plants
than 1 salinity pulse in previous text . Meanwhile, I find the mean biomass in
1-pulse, control treatment was similar to the mean biomass in 2-pulse,
control treatment, why did the plants in 1-pulse, control treatment not
recover from salinity pulse? In my opinion, these words should be deleted
here, but authors can discuss them in discussion part.
My recommendation is to publish this article when the problems mentioned
above are solved .
Authors Response: We agree with reviewer 2 that the wording in lines 274
through 279 is confusing and does not effectively serve to advance
understanding of the subject. We therefore have decided to omit the three
sentences contained in lines 274 through 279. We thank the reviewer for so
keenly pointing out this confusing information.
