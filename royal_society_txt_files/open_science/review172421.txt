The authors present a combined experimental-theoretical study on waves in monolayers of
collectively migrating MDCK-cells. Similar wave phenomena have been observed by other
groups before, most notably by the Trepat-group, but usually the subject is confounded by the
complex interplay between cell migration, polarization and division. Here the authors use a
chemical compound to suppress cell division, thus decreasing the role of jamming. They observe
that under these conditions, the waves become much more pronounced. Their careful image
analysis demonstrates that average velocity depends on density, that on top of this waves in
density and velocity exist, that they have opposite phase and that they move backwards. They
also have a convincing mathematical model explaining these features by introducing a
phenomenological coupling between strain and polarity: advancing cells pull on their followers
and they become polarized (possibly through the Merlin/Rac-pathway), thus the excitation is
propagating from the front into the bulk. I note that this interpretation is also strongly supported
by very recent Ref. 29, which reports similar phenomena for colliding monolayers, but did not
include any explanation or model as provided here. The authors also report experimental data
with an Arp2/3-inhibitor suppressing lamellipodia, in which case the waves are very weak or
absent, supporting the interpretation that polarity is the main point here.
In general, this is a very interesting, solid and timely study on collective cell migration. The text is
very well structured and written, the three figures are very concise and meaningful, and the
relevant literature is discussed in a fair and comprehensive manner. This work fits very well into
the emergent view that epithelial monolayers have a strongly elastic character, despite their flow-
like behavior, and that this elastic nature is highly relevant for information transmission between
cells. The combination of experiment, image processing and theory is very impressive. I
essentially recommend publication as is.
My only comments are that the velocity arrow in Fig. 1A actually belongs to B and could be
moved to the right hand side; and that in Fig. 3 it would be helpful to explain also in the caption
(not only in the text) what D and V_A actually mean (especially D, which is a rather abstract
quantity).

This manuscript by Tlili et al. analyzes velocity waves in a collectively migrating monolayer. The
study focusses on how cell proliferation and cell density distributions relate with cell velocities.
The overall trends of velocity waves are used to formulate a phenomenological model for
monolayer migration. Albeit a brief manuscript, it analyzes a feature of collective migration that
has not be particularly well-studied. However, there are several critical concerns that must be
studied:
1. Line 218 mentions that dividing cells have larger arrest density compared to non-dividing
(mitomycin treated) cells. What is the criterion for defining and measuring arrest density? Can
proliferating cells (wild type) have lower arrest densities at shorter time points? If so, would it
still hold true that dividing cells have higher velocity than non-dividing cells at a given density?
2. In line 498, it is mentioned that in case of dividing cells, at a given density, division causes
increase in the front velocity and also increases noise in cell velocities. Consequently in figure
S4D, there are no waves visible. However, non-dividing cells show much higher velocities at
lower densities (Figure1C). In those cases, the kymographs show waves (Figure 2A,S4B). These
results should be better discussed, particularly in relation to the following important question --
to what extent can these results be extrapolated to proliferative cells undergoing collective
migration in vivo?
3. Although the phenomenological model captures the key experimental findings, it would be
useful to make some predictions beyond what's been shown experimentally. Varying the
contributions of active and friction forces could generate different wave propagation phenotypes.
Simulations along these lines could provide additional ideas for new experiments.

Review of “Collective cell migration without proliferation: density determines cell velocity and
wave velocity” by Sham Tlili et al.
The authors present observations and numerical simulations of wavy migratory motions in a
population of cells. I enjoyed reading this paper and found it instructive on many levels. It will
make a fine contribution to the literature – my compliments to the authors.
Here are some remarks.
1. Abstract: “model quantitatively agrees with ... observations”. This is vague and may be
misleading: the model has adjustable parameters. Were quantitative metrics of the wave motion
predicted rather than fitted?
2. Abstract: “clarify hypotheses in the literature” may be too vague. Which hypotheses and what
gets clarified? Perhaps delete or replace with a specific claim.
3. Font size (also a note to editor!): the large margins and consequently small font in the printed
version present a big challenge to ageing eyes!
4. Intro, para 1: Is it possible, for the benefit of non-biologists, to define briefly what “normal
physiological behavior” means in this context?
5. Sect. 2(b), para beginning “kymographs are analyzed .. “. Much of this paragraph reads too
much like jargon reproduced from the user’s manual of some software package. The filtering
methods used to extract wave information are an important part of this paper; signal to noise is
not high. It would be most helpful to readers to describe the filtering steps in generic
mathematical and physical terms, so that the reader can judge for herself which features of the
filtered picture that emerges can be trusted. Intuitively, staring at the movies (or Fig. 1b) for
some time certainly suggests waves, but not necessarily as systematic or clean as in Fig. 2a. Is Fig.
2a real? Or is it the forcing of a wave of one period onto noisy data? This is important and the
authors might help the reader understand better.
6. The font size on the axis labels, etc., of the figures is ridiculous. Really. Likewise, the lengths
and orientations of the arrowheads in Fig. 1b are invisible on the printed page. Perhaps these
figures were prepared by somebody very young; or somebody with X-Men mutant vision.
7. p. 5, l. 50: The “pulsation” of a wave would be best defined mathematically the first time it is
encountered. The definition provided later implies that “pulsation” is a time-dependent field
8. p.6, lines 10 – 12. The projection of a cell onto the substrate increases substantially from wake
to front, relative to the overall collective migration. How can one tell whether the cell increases
its projected size because it is being stretched by a stress gradient (which I think is the model the
authors propose) rather than increasing its size using internally derived energy (the cell’s
metabolism), i.e., changing its shape as an automaton? It would be helpful to know exactly what
the authors reasoning is: how have they ruled out automatous shape change? Even a single cell
can spread across a substrate.
9. Fig. 1c implies substantial variation in the initial cell density, if I assume that the density at the
left is the initial density (is that correct?). A few lines would help on how such different initial
densities were achieved experimentally, how the cell volume varies with initial area density, and
what one might anticipate (before the experiments are reported) the general consequences for cell
behavior could be.
5
10. Please consider reporting the variation of cell height with density as the density changes: is
the cell volume conserved? This is important information for modeling the physics of the cells.
Please also consider reporting strain rates, whose average values and fluctuations over different
gauge lengths are also most interesting for understanding cell activity.
11. p 6, l. 4: please define the term “phase crest”; is it the locus of a velocity extremum in the
kymograph space?
12.
terms like “pulsation” and “phase crest” (a Google search on either term does not help – are they
standard jargon somewhere?), this is unnecessarily difficult to understand.
13.
14. p. 8, l.23: “purely phenomenological” doesn’t mean anything. What is pure and what is
phenomenological? Perhaps: “for simplicity, displacement and stress fields are assumed to be
functions of x and t only and we consider only one component of each field in state equations, the
component along the x direction”.
15. Eq. (4): “e” appears to be previously undefined. When it is defined implicitly following Eq.
(4), it may be helpful to some readers to elaborate on what the mathematical definition of its total
rate implies conceptually.
16. p. 8, l. 45: “below our current detection limit”. But in the experiments in this paper, the
authors have not talked about having any capability to measure cell-substrate tractions. What are
they saying here – did they try to measure tractions and fail? And regarding the phrase “if they
exist”: how do the cells propel themselves otherwise? Some re-writing here please.
17. Eq. (4) and in many places: The authors follow the popular view that cell motions are driven
by gradients in the state of stress in the cell population, together with an active term (here fa).
Thus Eq. (4), esp. (4.7), is couched in terms of e and Va. A few remarks might be helpful on the
degree to which the elastic strain (or stress) arising from forces imposed by neighboring cells is
known to correlate with cell migration. Other physical models (cells as automata) might also
lead to cell motions that create the observed wavy displacements.
18. What exactly do the authors mean by the term “cell polarity” in this paper? In the physical
model, parameter p is defined by Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8). But if I understand correctly, when the
polarity changes, the cell shape does not change directly, although of course there will ensue
consequences for the strain it experiences. I doubt that this mathematical definition of “cell
polarity” would necessarily be consistent with what others (especially biologists) refer to when
they write of “cell polarity” in general (don’t biologists usually refer by polarity to something
with a biologically distinguishable head and tail; and do the cells in the experiments look like
that?). Commentary required please.
19. Section 4(e) is interesting although not entirely convincing. We might wonder whether a
model could be constructed, with a different representation of the rate dependent behavior of a
living cell, that still fits the reported observations of waves but does not yield the result that the
– 58,
which appear to point to just such other choices.
20. p. 10, l. 56: “chosen to obtain a good agreement …”. Compare this with item 1 above.
21.
22. Section 4(f): The question of whether a transition exists in nature that corresponds to the
“stability threshold” the model generates, including the regime maps of Figs. 3B, 3D, and 3F, is
unclear. It is not observed in the authors’ experiments (unless I missed something!). It is
certainly interesting that waves do not always arise in other cases of collective migration (abut
see item 23); but there might be some other factor present in a different system. The authors
might re-phrase their discussion on this.
23. p. 13, l. 10: “difficult to detect in the past [11,30]”. But both the cited papers reported
observations of waves! Please clarify.
24. p. 13, l. 43 et seq.: Are the authors sure that the waves in the model developed in ref. [11] only
propagate “backwards”? I recollect that the model in [11] does a good job of reproducing the
6
kymograph from their experiments, including evolving strain amplitude patterns. Would that be
possible if the sense of wave propagation is incorrectly restricted in the model of [11]? This needs
fuller explanation.
25. p. 14, l.31: “increases with the cell density at the front”. Where was this shown – did I miss it?
What does “density at the front” mean? Density of the front row of cells? The front row and cells
within it are quite irregular in the movies. I’m lost here.
26. p. 14, l. 48: “The model assumes that both cell and wave velocities depend on lamellipodia
activity.” Readers could quarrel with this. The model is just Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8); the relation of
these equations to cell actions or the presence of lamellipodia is nothing more than the authors
asserting that certain parameters might increase or decrease under certain circumstances. As far
as the model goes, this is just semantic. To construct a model that represents lamellipodia
convincingly, surely one would require a detailed model of each cell, including a lamellipodial
geometrical feature that could be switched on or off?
27. p. 14, l. 58: “linear in the cell radius”. This appears to be a mis-statement.
28. last paragraph of the Conclusions: The first sentence is gratuitous and might be deleted. What
exactly does “the above predictions” refer to? Maybe this paragraph could just disappear
entirely.
29. I found the caption to Fig. 1 very difficult to follow. The colors in (C)? Total mystery and
invisible anyway (sorry). I suggest the caption should be re-written entirely, with care to define
all terms used. Is it possible the journal would permit the parts of part (C) to be printed on more
space than a postage stamp?
30. Fig. 2: Lots of invisible stuff here too.
31. Fig. 3: ditto. In all the figures, it would be helpful if the authors would provide word
definitions for variables in captions, rather than just using the symbol. Readers may wish to refer
to figures without having recently read the entire paper.
In summary, this paper will make a useful and significant contribution to our understanding of
collective cell behavior. However, in my opinion, substantial revision is necessary to bring the
paper to publication readiness, following the points raised above.
Part of bringing to readiness is dealing with a significant number of lapses in presentation.
But another major part of bringing to readiness is a careful review by the authors, which should
be part of a revised manuscript, of their logic in formulating their model, especially the necessity
or arbitrariness of their representations of cell response (elastic energy gradients, friction,
viscosity, effect of what they call “cell polarity”, etc.). The key question is: while the model can fit
their data, is it possible that a different representation of cell behavior could lead to similar
equations of state that would be equally successful in replicating the observed wave motions?
My own feeling is that this question remains open. The authors’ work is an important
contribution towards its resolution, but readers would be best served if the authors were careful
and clear about what is proven and what is left undetermined.
Last: I have checked the box "minor revisions", but I hope the authors will make substantial
changes, rather than a few lines here or there.

terms like “pulsation” and “phase crest” (a Google search on either term does not help – are they
standard jargon somewhere?), this is unnecessarily difficult to understand.
13.
14. p. 8, l.23: “purely phenomenological” doesn’t mean anything. What is pure and what is
phenomenological? Perhaps: “for simplicity, displacement and stress fields are assumed to be
functions of x and t only and we consider only one component of each field in state equations, the
component along the x direction”.
15. Eq. (4): “e” appears to be previously undefined. When it is defined implicitly following Eq.
(4), it may be helpful to some readers to elaborate on what the mathematical definition of its total
rate implies conceptually.
16. p. 8, l. 45: “below our current detection limit”. But in the experiments in this paper, the
authors have not talked about having any capability to measure cell-substrate tractions. What are
they saying here – did they try to measure tractions and fail? And regarding the phrase “if they
exist”: how do the cells propel themselves otherwise? Some re-writing here please.
17. Eq. (4) and in many places: The authors follow the popular view that cell motions are driven
by gradients in the state of stress in the cell population, together with an active term (here fa).
Thus Eq. (4), esp. (4.7), is couched in terms of e and Va. A few remarks might be helpful on the
degree to which the elastic strain (or stress) arising from forces imposed by neighboring cells is
known to correlate with cell migration. Other physical models (cells as automata) might also
lead to cell motions that create the observed wavy displacements.
18. What exactly do the authors mean by the term “cell polarity” in this paper? In the physical
model, parameter p is defined by Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8). But if I understand correctly, when the
polarity changes, the cell shape does not change directly, although of course there will ensue
consequences for the strain it experiences. I doubt that this mathematical definition of “cell
polarity” would necessarily be consistent with what others (especially biologists) refer to when
they write of “cell polarity” in general (don’t biologists usually refer by polarity to something
with a biologically distinguishable head and tail; and do the cells in the experiments look like
that?). Commentary required please.
19. Section 4(e) is interesting although not entirely convincing. We might wonder whether a
model could be constructed, with a different representation of the rate dependent behavior of a
living cell, that still fits the reported observations of waves but does not yield the result that the

which appear to point to just such other choices.
20. p. 10, l. 56: “chosen to obtain a good agreement …”. Compare this with item 1 above.
21.
22. Section 4(f): The question of whether a transition exists in nature that corresponds to the
“stability threshold” the model generates, including the regime maps of Figs. 3B, 3D, and 3F, is
unclear. It is not observed in the authors’ experiments (unless I missed something!). It is
certainly interesting that waves do not always arise in other cases of collective migration (abut
see item 23); but there might be some other factor present in a different system. The authors
might re-phrase their discussion on this.
23. p. 13, l. 10: “difficult to detect in the past [11,30]”. But both the cited papers reported
observations of waves! Please clarify.
24. p. 13, l. 43 et seq.: Are the authors sure that the waves in the model developed in ref. [11] only
propagate “backwards”? I recollect that the model in [11] does a good job of reproducing the
kymograph from their experiments, including evolving strain amplitude patterns. Would that be
possible if the sense of wave propagation is incorrectly restricted in the model of [11]? This needs
fuller explanation.
25. p. 14, l.31: “increases with the cell density at the front”. Where was this shown – did I miss it?
What does “density at the front” mean? Density of the front row of cells? The front row and cells
within it are quite irregular in the movies. I’m lost here.
13
26. p. 14, l. 48: “The model assumes that both cell and wave velocities depend on lamellipodia
activity.” Readers could quarrel with this. The model is just Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8); the relation of
these equations to cell actions or the presence of lamellipodia is nothing more than the authors
asserting that certain parameters might increase or decrease under certain circumstances. As far
as the model goes, this is just semantic. To construct a model that represents lamellipodia
convincingly, surely one would require a detailed model of each cell, including a lamellipodial
geometrical feature that could be switched on or off?
27. p. 14, l. 58: “linear in the cell radius”. This appears to be a mis-statement.
28. last paragraph of the Conclusions: The first sentence is gratuitous and might be deleted. What
exactly does “the above predictions” refer to? Maybe this paragraph could just disappear
entirely.
29. I found the caption to Fig. 1 very difficult to follow. The colors in (C)? Total mystery and
invisible anyway (sorry). I suggest the caption should be re-written entirely, with care to define
all terms used. Is it possible the journal would permit the parts of part (C) to be printed on more
space than a postage stamp?
30. Fig. 2: Lots of invisible stuff here too.
31. Fig. 3: ditto. In all the figures, it would be helpful if the authors would provide word
definitions for variables in captions, rather than just using the symbol. Readers may wish to refer
to figures without having recently read the entire paper.
In summary, this paper will make a useful and significant contribution to our understanding of
collective cell behavior. However, in my opinion, substantial revision is necessary to bring the
paper to publication readiness, following the points raised above.
Part of bringing to readiness is dealing with a significant number of lapses in presentation.
But another major part of bringing to readiness is a careful review by the authors, which should
be part of a revised manuscript, of their logic in formulating their model, especially the necessity
or arbitrariness of their representations of cell response (elastic energy gradients, friction,
viscosity, effect of what they call “cell polarity”, etc.). The key question is: while the model can fit
their data, is it possible that a different representation of cell behavior could lead to similar
equations of state that would be equally successful in replicating the observed wave motions?
My own feeling is that this question remains open. The authors’ work is an important
contribution towards its resolution, but readers would be best served if the authors were careful
and clear about what is proven and what is left undetermined.
Last: I have checked the box "minor revisions", but I hope the authors will make substantial
changes, rather than a few lines here or there.

The authors present a combined experimental-theoretical study on waves in monolayers of collectively
rating MDCK-cells. Similar wave phenomena have been observed by other groups before, most
ably by the Trepat-group, but usually the subject is confounded by the complex interplay between cell
ration, polarization and division. Here the authors use a chemical compound to suppress cell division,
s decreasing the role of jamming. They observe that under these conditions, the waves become much
e pronounced. Their careful image analysis demonstrates that average velocity depends on density,
on top of this waves in density and velocity exist, that they have opposite phase and that they move
kwards. They also have a convincing mathematical model explaining these features by introducing a
nomenological coupling between strain and polarity: advancing cells pull on their followers and they
ome polarized (possibly through the Merlin/Rac-pathway), thus the excitation is propagating from
front into the bulk. I note that this interpretation is also strongly supported by very recent Ref.
which reports similar phenomena for colliding monolayers, but did not include any explanation or
el as provided here. The authors also report experimental data with an Arp2/3-inhibitor suppressing
ellipodia, in which case the waves are very weak or absent, supporting the interpretation that polarity

In general, this is a very interesting, solid and timely study on collective cell migration. The text

ature is discussed in a fair and comprehensive manner. This work fits very well into the emergent
that epithelial monolayers have a strongly elastic character, despite their flow-like behavior, and
this elastic nature is highly relevant for information transmission between cells. The combination of
eriment, image processing and theory is very impressive. I essentially recommend publication as is.
We thank you for this positive opinion.

and that in Fig. 3 it would be helpful to explain also in the caption (not only in the text) what D
VA actually mean (especially D, which is a rather abstract quantity).
In the revised version, we write in the caption of former Fig. 3, now Fig. 5: “strain diffusion coefficient
nd active velocity VA ”. We have also recalled the meanings of other parameters, as suggested by
eree 3, point 31.

This manuscript by Tlili et al. analyzes velocity waves in a collectively migrating monolayer. The
y focusses on how cell proliferation and cell density distributions relate with cell velocities. The overall
ds of velocity waves are used to formulate a phenomenological model for monolayer migration. Albeit
ief manuscript, it analyzes a feature of collective migration that has not be particularly well-studied.
We thank you for this positive opinion.
However, there are several critical concerns that must be studied:
We thank you for these constructive comments and we address them point by point below.
1a. Line 218 mentions that dividing cells have larger arrest density compared to non-dividing (mito-
in treated) cells. What is the criterion for defining and measuring arrest density?
In the revised version we write: “and a larger “arrest density” defined as the intercept of the velocity
ph with the density axis”.
1b. Can proliferating cells (wild type) have lower arrest densities at shorter time points? If so, would
ill hold true that dividing cells have higher velocity than non-dividing cells at a given density?
In the revised version, we write in the Discussion section: “Oriented cell divisions have two antagonistic
cts (Fig. 2C; Fig. S4). First, they contribute to increase the cell movement and the front velocity;
y also increase the noise in cell velocity, and more regions have a negative velocity (Fig. S4D). Hence
given density, a proliferating monolayer has a higher velocity than a non-proliferating one. Second,
ever, a monolayer with a high proliferation rate has a different time evolution: its density increases
h time (while a monolayer with a low proliferation rate or no proliferation at all has a density which
eases with time due to spreading). A monolayer with a high proliferation rate has a velocity which
eases with time and reaches within hours a density where cells are jammed and lamellipodia are
ent, the front velocity is low and mainly due to divisions.”
2a. In line 498, it is mentioned that in case of dividing cells, at a given density, division causes increase
he front velocity and also increases noise in cell velocities. Consequently in figure S4D, there are no
es visible. However, non-dividing cells show much higher velocities at lower densities (Figure 1C). In
e cases, the kymographs show waves (Figure 2A,S4B). These results should be better discussed
In the revised version, we write in the Discussion section: ”In experiments with divisions, a monolayer
h a high proliferation rate leaves too quickly, or never reaches, the low density regime where large-
litude steady waves develop.”
2b. particularly in relation to the following important question – to what extent can these results be
apolated to proliferative cells undergoing collective migration in vivo?
We are very interested in the relation with in vivo migration, which we are currently investigating,
we do not have results yet, and this is beyond the scope of the present paper.

3a. Although the phenomenological model captures the key experimental findings, it would be useful
ake some predictions beyond what’s been shown experimentally. Varying the contributions of active
friction forces could generate different wave propagation phenotypes.
In the revised version we write, in the Conclusion section: “This suggests that increasing traction
es, and/or decreasing the friction, would increase the cell and wave velocities; increasing the monolayer
ness, and/or decreasing the friction, would increase the strain diffusion coefficient, and thus decrease
wave amplitude and frequency.”
3b. Simulations along these lines could provide additional ideas for new experiments.
We are very interested in simulations, and they are in progress.
In the revised version we write: ”Numerical simulations, which could turn useful for instance to vary
ndary conditions or to link cell-level ingredients with collective migration, are beyond the scope of
present work.”

The authors present observations and numerical simulations of wavy migratory motions in a popula-
of cells. I enjoyed reading this paper and found it instructive on many levels. It will make a fine
tribution to the literature - my compliments to the authors.
We thank you for this positive opinion.
Here are some remarks.
We thank you for all your constructive comments. We address them point by point below.
1. Abstract: “model quantitatively agrees with ... observations”. This is vague and may be misleading:
model has adjustable parameters. Were quantitative metrics of the wave motion predicted rather
n fitted?
We do not perform predictions stricto sensu. The relation VA vs <U+03C1> is entirely fixed by the experimental
ph, former Fig. 1C, now Fig. 2CD. Beside that information, we have three adjustable parameters, m,
t ; we take reasonable orders of magnitude and adjust them slightly to agree with many observations.
last parameter, D, cannot be guesed and is left free to plot the phase diagram.
In the revised version, we write in the abstract: “With reasonable values of parameters, this model
es with several of our experimental observations.”
2. Abstract: “clarify hypotheses in the literature” may be too vague. Which hypotheses and what
clarified? Perhaps delete or replace with a specific claim.
In the revised version we have suppressed these vague words and we now write: “Together, our exper-
nts and model disentangle the respective contributions of polarized active velocity and of proliferation
onolayer migration”.
3. Font size (also a note to editor!): the large margins and consequently small font in the printed
ion present a big challenge to ageing eyes!
The large margins and consequently small font are fixed by the journal template and we cannot modify
m.
4. Intro, para 1: Is it possible, for the benefit of non-biologists, to define briefly what “normal
siological behavior” means in this context?
In the revised version, these words no longer appear, and we write: “each individual cell can grow,
de, die, migrate”.
5. Sect. 2(b), para beginning “kymographs are analyzed .. ”. Much of this paragraph reads too much
jargon reproduced from the user’s manual of some software package. The filtering methods used to
act wave information are an important part of this paper; signal to noise is not high. It would be
t helpful to readers to describe the filtering steps in generic mathematical and physical terms, so
the reader can judge for herself which features of the filtered picture that emerges can be trusted.
itively, staring at the movies (or Fig. 1b) for some time certainly suggests waves, but not necessarily
5
ystematic or clean as in Fig. 2a. Is Fig. 2a real? Or is it the forcing of a wave of one period onto
y data? This is important and the authors might help the reader understand better.
In the revised version, we have added the required clarifications, and distinguished better the filtering
the wavelet analysis, which is a measurement tool. As such, the wavelet analysis, which is a home-
e software, requires explanations with some jargon and details, as is expected from a Method section.
now write: “To perform quantitative analyses of the kymographs, we use wavelets as measurement
s (rather than as filtering tools). They extract from a signal its wavelengths and time frequencies, like
rier Transform does, but in addition wavelets can determine the space and time variations of these
ntities. We use a custom-made software for wavelet transform profilometry (WTP)”.
For the kymograph representation and filtering, we now write: “ This first step, projecting ~v on x
averaging it over y, is already enough to make visible the main features of the velocity field: velocity
dient along x and propagating waves. To improve the visualisation, and enable for a qualitative
lysis, we plot the space-time diagram or “kymograph” of V (x, t). The next step consists in filtering
We first remove small scale noise using a Gaussian blur of standard deviation 15 min and 30 µm (and
iding window which is three times larger). We then separate scales, and decompose this denoised
nto large-scale V¯ and middle-scale V - V¯ , using a Gaussian filter of standard deviation 50 min and
µm (again, with a sliding window which is three times larger).”
In the Results section, we now write that the waves “are visible quantitatively even on the raw
ograph”.
6. The font size on the axis labels, etc., of the figures is ridiculous. Really. Likewise, the lengths and
ntations of the arrowheads in Fig. 1b are invisible on the printed page. Perhaps these figures were
pared by somebody very young; or somebody with X-Men mutant vision.
To enlarge the panels, we have splitted former Figs. 1 and 2, now Figs. 1 to 4, and enlarged former
3, now Fig. 5.
7a. p. 5, l. 50: The “pulsation” of a wave would be best defined mathematically the first time it is
ountered.
In the revised version we replace “pulsation” with “angular frequency”. At its first occurrence, we
e: “angular frequency <U+03C9> (2p times the frequency)”.
7b. The definition provided later implies that “pulsation” is a time-dependent field <U+03C9>(x, t).
In the revised version we write:
- in the Materials and methods section: “The argument of Am (xi , tj ) provides the wrapped fringe
se fw (xi , tj ). The phase fw (xi , tj ) is unwrapped along time, and the local angular frequency <U+03C9> (2p
es the frequency) is deduced by differentiation with respect to time t according to the sign convention
<U+2202>fV /<U+2202>t. Independently, the phase fw (xi , tj ) is unwrapped along space, and the local wave number
deduced by differentiation with respect to space x according to the sign convention k = -<U+2202>fV /<U+2202>x.”
- in the Results section: ”We observe (Figs. 3A, S6A) that k varies in space; conversely, at a given
e, <U+03C9> does not vary significantly with space. Accordingly, <U+03C9> does not depend explicitly on local density,
ch varies significantly with space.”
- in the Phenomenological description section: “For simplicity we develop a local model, neglecting
large scale gradients. We introduce the angular frequency <U+03C9>, the wavenumber k < 0, and the wave
city c = <U+03C9>/k < 0, and we treat them as numbers rather than as fields. As explained above, we separate
velocity into its average V¯ and its variations Ve , the density into its average <U+03C1>¯ and its variations <U+03C1>e, and
n we treat V¯ and <U+03C1>¯ as numbers rather than as fields. Within this approximation, wavelet analysis
Fourier analysis become indistinguishable.”
6
7c. What then does “decreases the pulsation” mean?
In the revised version we write:
“Inhibiting lamellipodia decreases cell velocity while waves either disappear or have a lower frequency.”
“Inhibiting lamellipodia formation damps the waves and decreases their frequency or even leads to
r suppression.”
“Inhibiting lamellipodia formation strongly decreases the amplitude and frequency of velocity waves
. 4A)”
“Inhibiting lamellipodia formation significantly decreases <U+03C9> (Fig. S3B).”
“Inhibiting lamellipodia formation decreases <U+03C9>, at a given value of Rmean measured near the front
. S3B).”
8. p.6, lines 10 - 12. The projection of a cell onto the substrate increases substantially from wake to
t, relative to the overall collective migration. How can one tell whether the cell increases its projected
because it is being stretched by a stress gradient (which I think is the model the authors propose)
er than increasing its size using internally derived energy (the cell’s metabolism), i.e., changing its
pe as an automaton? It would be helpful to know exactly what the authors reasoning is: how have
y ruled out automatous shape change? Even a single cell can spread across a substrate.
We understand this point as a discussion of the respective role of cell-autonomous and non-autonomous
tributions to the migration. To address it, in the revised version we now write in the Discussion section:
the monolayer spreading was only determined by stretching under a stress gradient, then it would be
lar to a passive material wetting a solid substrate; the velocity and density profiles would depend on
distance to the front. Our experiments rule out this description: indeed, the velocity profile rather
ends directly on the density, and the cell-autonomous active term of Eq. 4.7, <U+2202> (Va p) /<U+2202>x, plays an
ortant role. Conversely, the stretching under a stress gradient actually feeds back on the cell polarity
activity, through Eq. 4.8 and its non-autonomous signalling term me. We suggest that this mutual
pling between cell-autonomous active migration and non-autonomous stretching by neighbouring cells,
marized by Eq. 4.9, gives rise to collective migration.”
See also the answer to point 17.
9a. Fig. 1c implies substantial variation in the initial cell density, if I assume that the density at the
is the initial density (is that correct?).
Yes, former Fig. 1c, now Fig. 2, implies substantial variation in the initial cell density. In the revised
ion, its caption provides the initial values.
No, the left is not necessarily the initial density. In the revised version, we write in the Discussion
ion: “a monolayer with a high proliferation rate has a different time evolution: its density increases
h time (while a monolayer with a low proliferation rate or no proliferation at all has a density which
eases with time due to spreading).”
9.b A few lines would help on how such different initial densities were achieved experimentally, how
cell volume varies with initial area density, and what one might anticipate (before the experiments
reported) the general consequences for cell behavior could be.
In the revised version, we write in the Material and methods section: “To vary the initial cell density,
can vary the amount of deposited cells and/or the time they are left to proliferate; we always begin
h confluent monolayers. We do not measure cell volumes; we expect they are all similar at the time of
osition and that the main contribution to their variation is that of cell cycles. When the recordings
ins and the density is measured, the monolayer has already migrated for a few hours (see below), so
initial density varies spatially from the reservoir to the front (for details, see caption of Fig. 2A,B).”
7
And in the Result section: “A priori, one could expect the cell velocity to depend on density, density
dient and distance to front (hence on the monolayer history)”
10a. Please consider reporting the variation of cell height with density as the density changes: is the
volume conserved? This is important information for modeling the physics of the cells.
In the revised version we write: “A typical range of variation of h is from 13 µm far from the front to
m near the front (see Supp. Fig. S7 of Ref. [11], where the cell volume is approximately conserved).”
10b. Please also consider reporting strain rates, whose average values and fluctuations over different
ge lengths are also most interesting for understanding cell activity.
As mentioned in our answer to point 15, in the revised version we now write: “the velocity gradient
<U+2202>x (plotted in Fig. 3B) is equivalent to the total strain rate”
11. p 6, l. 4: please define the term “phase crest”; is it the locus of a velocity extremum in the
ograph space?
Yes. But since this term is unclear, and since we use it in fact only in qualitative sentences, in the
sed version we replace this term with “wave pattern”.
12. p. 7, l. 29: “decreases <U+03C9>”: is that the same thing as increasing the wavelength? But see above
ark about <U+03C9> apparently being a field <U+03C9>(x, t). For the general reader who gets lost (like me) by terms
“pulsation” and “phase crest” (a Google search on either term does not help - are they standard
on somewhere?), this is unnecessarily difficult to understand.
In the revised version, the words “pulsation” and “phase crest” no longer appear: see points 7a and
13. p. 7, lines 57 and 58: more problems with <U+03C9> (a field and its own amplitude?).
In the revised version, we have tried to clarify that aspect: see point 7b.
14. p. 8, l.23: “purely phenomenological” doesn’t mean anything. What is pure and what is phe-
enological? Perhaps: “for simplicity, displacement and stress fields are assumed to be functions of x
t only and we consider only one component of each field in state equations, the component along the
rection”.
In the revised version, the word “pure” no longer appears. We now write, as suggested by the Referee:
r simplicity, displacement and stress fields are assumed to be functions of x and t only and we consider
one component of each field in state equations, the component along the x direction. In a real 2D
ription of stress, this would have to be replaced by the deviator of the stress tensor”
In addition, to clarify the word “phenomenological”, we define it at its first occurrence, by writing:
ilding on these models, we propose a simple phenomenological description (which means we model
phenomena without explicitly modeling their microscopic or biochemical causes).”
15. Eq. (4): “e” appears to be previously undefined. When it is defined implicitly following Eq.
it may be helpful to some readers to elaborate on what the mathematical definition of its total rate
lies conceptually.
8
In the revised version we now write: “Here, in such a 1D Maxwell model, the velocity gradient <U+2202>V /<U+2202>x
tted in Fig. 3B) is equivalent to the total strain rate, which in turn is the sum of the elastic and
ous strain rates. They are in series, and the viscous strain rate is e/t , where t is the viscoelastic
e and e the elastic strain. It would be beyond the scope of the present paper to relate sub-cellular
edients with this elastic strain e, which we consider here as an effective, coarse-grained variable [58].”
16. p. 8, l. 45: “below our current detection limit”. But in the experiments in this paper, the authors
e not talked about having any capability to measure cell-substrate tractions. What are they saying
- did they try to measure tractions and fail? And regarding the phrase “if they exist”: how do the
propel themselves otherwise? Some re-writing here please.
The revised version writes: “From these orders of magnitude, we predict that detecting waves of
tion force should be technically challenging.”
17. Eq. (4) and in many places: The authors follow the popular view that cell motions are driven by
dients in the state of stress in the cell population, together with an active term (here fa ). Thus Eq.
esp. (4.7), is couched in terms of e and Va . A few remarks might be helpful on the degree to which
elastic strain (or stress) arising from forces imposed by neighboring cells is known to correlate with
migration. Other physical models (cells as automata) might also lead to cell motions that create the
erved wavy displacements.
Our answer to point 8 already addresses part of this remark.
In our manuscript, we refer to the paper by Das et al. (now Ref. [66]) for a possible molecular
hanism by which the elastic strain (or stress) arising from forces imposed by neighboring cells is
wn to correlate with cell migration.
Finally, we believe that the same biophysical ingredients can be implemented either in cellular au-
ata (and more generally in bottom-up simulations based on individually described cells) or using
tinuum mechanics equations. We choose one or the other as a matter of convenience and depending
he question we address. Here, to establish a phase diagram based on relevant parameters, we prefer
se continuum mechanics.
In the revised version, we now write: “Our goal is to perform testable predictions, compare them with
eriments, and extract the values of relevant physical parameters. Continuum mechanics helps here
nderstand the physical effect of each parameter and draw a phase diagram. Numerical simulations,
ch could turn useful for instance to vary boundary conditions or to link cell-level ingredients with
ective migration, are beyond the scope of the present work.”
18. What exactly do the authors mean by the term “cell polarity” in this paper? In the physical
el, parameter p is defined by Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8). But if I understand correctly, when the polarity
nges, the cell shape does not change directly, although of course there will ensue consequences for the
in it experiences. I doubt that this mathematical definition of “cell polarity” would necessarily be
sistent with what others (especially biologists) refer to when they write of “cell polarity” in general
n’t biologists usually refer by polarity to something with a biologically distinguishable head and tail;
do the cells in the experiments look like that?). Commentary required please.
We agree with the Referee. In the biological literature, the polarity is often related either to the dis-
ution of lamellipodia, or to the cell shape, or to the spatial distribution or Planar Cell Polarity (PCP)
eins. Conversely, in the biophysics theoretical literature, we often find a mathematical definition like
, usually without any particular justification. Within our phenomenological model (see answer to
t 14), we too use a mathematical definition of p, and do not attempt at relating it with any biological
edient. We are currently working in order to establish such a relation, but we did not establish it yet
it is beyond the scope of this paper.

In the revised version, we now write: “The dimensionless real number p is a mathematical term
cting, within the current simplified one-dimensional description, the actual two-dimensional cell po-
zation.”
19. Section 4(e) is interesting although not entirely convincing. We might wonder whether a model
d be constructed, with a different representation of the rate dependent behavior of a living cell, that
fits the reported observations of waves but does not yield the result that the presence or absence of
es depends on the value of t . Compare with p. 13, lines 56 - 58, which appear to point to just such
er choices.
We agree with the Referee. Several choices are possible and, by insisting that our model is only
nomenological (see answer to point 14), we accept that it is not necessarily the only model to describe
same phenomena. We only note that, in contrast to some of the theoretical articles we quote, our
ent choice of ingredients has been instructed by the experimental observations of Das et al. (now ref
) and is thus reasonable.
20. p. 10, l. 56: “chosen to obtain a good agreement”. Compare this with item 1 above.
See answer to point 1 (adjustable parameters) and to point 19 (existence of alternative models).
21. p. 10, l. 32: perhaps “1 µm/min” rather than “a µm/min”.
Corrected.
22. Section 4(f): The question of whether a transition exists in nature that corresponds to the
bility threshold” the model generates, including the regime maps of Figs. 3B, 3D, and 3F, is unclear.
not observed in the authors’ experiments (unless I missed something!). It is certainly interesting
waves do not always arise in other cases of collective migration (abut see item 23); but there might
ome other factor present in a different system. The authors might re-phrase their discussion on this.
In the revised version, we now write: “Our experimental observations with drugs against proliferation
amellipodia are compatible with the theoretical picture in which waves spontaneously appear close
he instability limit (Fig. 5). This could explain why in preceding experiments with proliferation and
ming, waves were damped and more difficult to extract from noise beyond one period [11,30,31](see
the Supp. Figs. S2, S5 of Ref. [32]). It also explains that wave observations are sensitive to
erimental details; parameters can change from one experiment to another depending on cell size or
strate properties such as stiffness or coating.”
23. p. 13, l. 10: “difficult to detect in the past [11,30]”. But both the cited papers reported
ervations of waves! Please clarify.
In the revised version, these words no longer appear, see answer to point 22.
24. p. 13, l. 43 et seq.: Are the authors sure that the waves in the model developed in ref. [11] only
pagate “backwards”? I recollect that the model in [11] does a good job of reproducing the kymograph
their experiments, including evolving strain amplitude patterns. Would that be possible if the sense
ave propagation is incorrectly restricted in the model of [11]? This needs fuller explanation.

In Ref. [11], Serra-Picamal et al. 2012, the experimental figure Fig. 3a,b shows waves that propagate
the moving front to the center, hence backwards in the sense that the wave velocity has a sign
osed to that of the cell (and hence front) velocity.
Again in Ref. [11], the numerical figure Fig. 4d-f shows waves that propagate from the center to the
ing front, hence forwards in the sense that the wave velocity has the same sign as that of the cell
d hence front) velocity.
Since this experiment displays two symmetric fronts, one at the right and one at the left, the wave
ern is mirror-symmetrised. Hence in both figures, the wave pattern appears as a cross, so that the
erimental and numerical results seem to coincide. The visual similarity is reinforced by the fact that in
h figures, the absolute value of wave velocity is twice the absolute value of the front velocity, yielding
riking X-shaped pattern.
But a careful examination of both figures shows without ambiguity that the signs of the wave velocities
r. This even clearer when looking at only half of each figure.
In the revised version, we now write: “Note that in Fig. 4d-f of Ref. [11], simulations predict
ard-propagating waves, arising at the center and moving toward the front, i.e. waves velocity in the
e direction as cell velocity. Fig. 6 of Ref. [55] too predicts forward propagating waves. In contrast,
eriments of Refs. [11,29], our experiments and model agree that waves arise at the front and propagate
kwards. We are not aware of any interpretation of this discrepancy.”
25. p. 14, l.31: “increases with the cell density at the front”. Where was this shown - did I miss it?
at does “density at the front” mean? Density of the front row of cells? The front row and cells within
re quite irregular in the movies. I’m lost here.
In the revised version, in the Methods section, we now write that we “define discrete measurements
ensity with an average on time t over 180 min and on space over 176 µm wide boxes in the distance
the moving front. We entirely exclude the first box, where statistics are noisy due to the front. In
5C and Fig. S3B, the average near the front is taken on the three bins (3 × 176 = 528 µm) next to
front one.”
In the Results section, we write: “Interestingly, comparing experiments with different density profiles
ws that, in a 180 min × 528 µm bin near the moving front, the wave frequency decreases with the
density (Fig. S3B).”
In former Fig. 3F, now Fig. 5F, we recall it in the caption. We also specify on the horizontal axis
the variable is the mean effective cell radius measured at the front. Same in Fig. S3B.
26. p. 14, l. 48: “The model assumes that both cell and wave velocities depend on lamellipodia
vity.” Readers could quarrel with this. The model is just Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8); the relation of these
ations to cell actions or the presence of lamellipodia is nothing more than the authors asserting that
ain parameters might increase or decrease under certain circumstances. As far as the model goes,
is just semantic. To construct a model that represents lamellipodia convincingly, surely one would
ire a detailed model of each cell, including a lamellipodial geometrical feature that could be switched
r off?
In the revised version, we now write: “An interpretation of our results is that both cell and wave
cities depend on lamellipodia activity.”
27. p. 14, l. 58: “linear in the cell radius”. This appears to be a mis-statement.
At the first occurrence of the words ‘linear in the cell radius”, we now recall that it is the mean
ctive cell radius, Rmean , and that the linear relation has a non-zero intercept.
In the revised version, we now write: “V¯ increases linearly (with a non-zero intercept) with the mean
ctive cell radius, V¯ = 0.106 Rmean - 0.864 (Fig. 2D).”
11
In order to keep the text legible, we leave unchanged all other occurrences of the words ‘linear in the
radius”.
28. last paragraph of the Conclusions: The first sentence is gratuitous and might be deleted. What
ctly does “the above predictions” refer to? Maybe this paragraph could just disappear entirely.
In the revised version, we have suppressed this paragraph.
29. I found the caption to Fig. 1 very difficult to follow. The colors in (C)? Total mystery and
sible anyway (sorry). I suggest the caption should be re-written entirely, with care to define all terms
d. Is it possible the journal would permit the parts of part (C) to be printed on more space than a
tage stamp?
As mentioned in answer to point 6, we have enlarged the panels. We have kept the same colors in
er Fig. 1C, now Fig. 2A,B, which were chosen to be suitable even for several color-blind people, and
hope that thanks to the enlargment they are more visible. We have also clarified the caption.
30. Fig. 2: Lots of invisible stuff here too.
As mentioned in answer to point 6, we have enlarged the panels, and we hope that they are more
ble.
31. Fig. 3: ditto. In all the figures, it would be helpful if the authors would provide word definitions
variables in captions, rather than just using the symbol. Readers may wish to refer to figures without
ing recently read the entire paper.
This has been also suggested by Referee 1. Accordingly, in the revised version we have recalled the
nings of parameters of former Fig. 3, now Fig. 5.
In summary, this paper will make a useful and significant contribution to our understanding of col-
ive cell behavior. However, in my opinion, substantial revision is necessary to bring the paper to
lication readiness, following the points raised above. Part of bringing to readiness is dealing with a
ificant number of lapses in presentation. But another major part of bringing to readiness is a careful
ew by the authors, which should be part of a revised manuscript, of their logic in formulating their
el, especially the necessity or arbitrariness of their representations of cell response (elastic energy
dients, friction, viscosity, effect of what they call “cell polarity”, etc.). The key question is: while the
el can fit their data, is it possible that a different representation of cell behavior could lead to similar
ations of state that would be equally successful in replicating the observed wave motions? My own
ng is that this question remains open. The authors’ work is an important contribution towards its
lution, but readers would be best served if the authors were careful and clear about what is proven
what is left undetermined. Last: I have checked the box ”minor revisions”, but I hope the authors
make substantial changes, rather than a few lines here or there.
We thank the Referee for this positive opinion.
We agree that there was a significant number of lapses in presentation and, thanks to the Referee’s
structive comments, we have done our best to perform the required clarifications (highlighted in color
he text).
Finally, and in agreement with our answer to point 19, it will certainly be possible in the future to
a model (or even several models) which will reproduce the same phenomena with other ingredients,
efully provided by future detailed experiments.
