The reliability of dental characters in the taxonomic determination of equids has been a topic of
contention for some time. In my view, this paper is a very interesting and valuable contribution
for palaeontologists and zooarchaeologists towards the settling of this issue. As far as I can judge,
the methodology(ies) is(are) sound and, while a larger number of specimens would have been
very welcome in order to capture a larger proportion of intra-apecies variability, I don't believe
that this addition would have a major impact on the conclusions. The synergy between GMM and
genetics is an important aspect of the contribution and is particularly welcome.
I have minor concerns/observations/suggestions regarding the clarity of some
sentences/parragraphs:
1. I believe the sentence in lines 23-27 in Page 3 could be reformulated. This sentence states that
"Wild asses include the African wild ass... and its domestic form the donkey...., the Asian wild
asses (Equus kiang and Equus hemionus) and several recognised subspecies of E. hemionus". In
my view, the several subspecies are not in addition to the E. hemionus mentioned first but a part
of it. Therefore I think the sentence should reflect this (e.g. "... the Asian wild asses, Equus kiang
and E. hemionus, the latter comprising several recognised subspecies").
2. In my opinion, the sentence in Page 3 line 39 could be slightly modified by adding the words
'relatively limited' to read " the relatively limited biodiversity in contemporary equine species...."
in order to enhance the contrast between past and present diversities.
3. In page 4, lines 47-54 could be reformulated for the sake of clarity (a suggestion: " However,
this approach is restricted to areas and/or periods conducive to the preservation of ancient DNA;
this would usually -but not always - exclude warm environments such as.....").
4. The sentence in Page 5 lines 24-31 appears somewhat unclear. I am unsure whether the authors
meant appropiate, rather than inappropiate (otherwise, the begining of the sentence with
'Though' and the last part of the sentence would, in my view, not make sense). In the same page,
line 39-41: perhaps it should use the word 'was' rather than 'were'?
5. In the references, in some instances the (French) month of publication is included (e.g. Page 22
line 46); I believe this is not the usual format for the Journal?
6. I think it is a bit unclear where each specimen comes from; we have the Codes for the labs in
Table S1, but there is no key for these... (what is NY? what is BM).
In Table 1, the French word Hybride is used; should read Hybrid in English.
Finally, I have a suggestion (perhaps more of a request...) regarding a subject that I find
particularly interesting and relevant form many zooarchaeologists: the identification of mules.
These hybrids are known to have played an essential role in e.g. The Roman Empire and in
Medieval times. Can the authors add a final comment on the feasibility/reliability of their results
in regards to the identification of hybrids (i.e. mules?). I am aware that skeletons of these hybrids
are very difficult to come by and thus the extent of the morphological variability in this 'species'
is not well understood. Would the authors regard their method as reliable for the identification of
mules/hinnies? is the study of further specimens of this 'type' necessary in order to determine
this?

This is a rigorous paper that performs a very useful function. It is the first paper that clearly
demonstrates that enamal fold patterning in equid teeth do preserve a phenotypic ralationship
that can be used to seperate species, and that this is generally not obscured by issues of differing
tooth wear. Whilst other work has suggested the potential for this approach, the reliability and
basis have been questioned. This paper will become the key one cited to provide the sound basis
for this type of approach. This paper will be of interest to zoologists, palaeontologists,
archaeologists and geneticists. The samples appear to be adequate, and, whilst I am not a
statistics specialist, I perceive this work to be robust in this respect and in line with other high
quality work in the field of GMM. The illustrations are clear and appropriate. An excellent paper.
I recommend publication with one very slight modification. The statement on page 14, line 34,
that GMM approaches "completely" resolve environmental confounding factors in phylogenetic
signals needs more qualification. This paragraphs referes to these problems in both bones and
teeth. I think the issues described are really only resolved in teeth that do not remodel plastically
in life. Bones certainly undergo shape change, as well as size differences, related to environment
and activity. Perhaps this is less of a problem in joint enclosed bones (e.g. astragalus) but long
bone robusticity and muscle attachments are certainly prone to shape change that could affect
GMM. Horse teeth, in their structure, are not prone to much variation through wear, but in many
other species wear levels would problably confound enamel patterning. The statement is true in a
narrower sense.

This paper makes a useful contribution to the paleontological study of one of the most
remarkable model systems in evolutionary biology, the horse. The fossil record of horses
famously records an evolutionary transformation from small five-toed animals to modern horses,
zebras, and asses, and the record of the clade over the last 2 million years is closely associated
with big questions related to climate cycles, speciation, and the evolution of humans. However,
analysis of the last two million years of horse history is hampered by taxonomic uncertainties
related to variability in cheek tooth morphology, which makes up most of the record. The
authors of this manuscript make a major contribution (1) by proposing a workable protocol for
applying geometric morphometrics to the very complex morphology of the crown that can be
used interchangeably on any cheek tooth, and (2) by demonstrating that crown patterns are
closely associated with phylogenetic relationships of modern equids. Unquestionably this
contribution is worth publishing. In my opinion, the methodology is flawlessly applied: the
geometric morphometric analyses are sound, the statistics are fully multivariate (including the K
statistic used to measure phylogenetic component of variance), and the protocol for landmarking
the crown shape captures the complexity of its shape.
Despite the clarity of the results with living taxa, two important issues will undoubtedly
complicate morphometric interpretation of the fossil record, both of which should be highlighted
somewhere in the paper, probably the discussion. The first is alluded to early in the paper,
namely the effects of wear on shape of the crown pattern. It is wear that makes the equid fossil
record notoriously difficult to interpret, and the morphometric solutions proposed here are
successful because they are applied only to teeth of the same wear stage. Thus their power to
discriminate taxa will be strongest when teeth of the same wear stage are available in the fossil
record. The second is that taxa will predictably become less distinct in shape as their lineages are
traced back to their common ancestor. The shapes of the living taxa are divergent enough that
they perform well in the statistical analyses, but taxa with less time since common ancestry will
naturally be less distinguishable. For crown equids, this means that morphometric power will
decrease as a function of time before present. I don’t believe either of these issues needs to be
discussed in great depth, but suitable caveats about the ultimate limits of the findings presented
in the paper should be offered in the discussion and conclusion.
Otherwise, I have only a few minor suggestions as follows:
p. 2, lines 30-31: this should say either “with the K statistic” or “with K statistics”. (and again on
p. 6, lines 3-5). In both places I suggest adding that you are using the multivariate K statistic,
which is an important piece of information.
p. 6, line 55: “cameras” does not need an apostrophe here because it is a simple plural.
p. 9, line 58: it is ok to cite Klingenberg and Gidazewski here, but the original paper to project a
phylogenetic tree into geometric morphometric space, to the best of my knowledge, was Rohlf
(2002).

This is a very good paper providing us with a valuable tool for identifying, anatomically and
taxonomically, different isolated equid check teeth. It is well structured and carefully researched.
I am neither an expert of statistics or GMM so there are some of the more technical aspects of the
paper on which I cannot provide a fully informed evaluation.
I think the paper can be accepted with very minor revisions.
I find that the aims of the research are not made sufficiently clear. There is some confusion
between the zooarchaeological and paleontological aspects and the reference to the domestication
and conservation issues is just a distraction, which should be avoided. The way I understand it,
this paper provides a tool for the anatomical and taxonomic separation of equid mandibular
cheek teeth, which seems important enough without having to elaborate further (and is valuable
for both palaeontologists and zooarchaeologists). Then there is the evolutionary/phylogenetic
aspect, which represents a correlated, but distinct theme. I think better clarity is necessary.
In Methods some explanation should be provided of why the paper focuses on mandibular teeth
and on the P3-M2 sequence. I can see the reasons but I don’t think the reader should be left
guessing.
p.14: initial part of the discussions comes across as a bit cocky. Traditional biometry and
morphology have provided very valuable information that is still very useful. GMM should be
6
seen as an additional tool that is integrated with such approaches, rather than as a way to
completely overtake past morphometric approaches, which would be a grave mistake.
p.15: “For example, the criterion proposed by Davis (40) to separate zebras from asses and horses
is the penetration of the ectoflexid up to the linguaflexid folds. According to our study, this
criterion is only applicable to the molars and not the premolars”.
This statement worried me because, far from being a new consideration, this is exactly what
Davis wrote in his 1980 paper, and the issue is well known to everybody who has used the
morphology of check teeth to separate equid species. It is obviously beyond the possibilities of a
reviewer to check that all the literature has been quoted accurately but the above mistake should
ring an alarm bell and I would encourage the authors to double check the accuracy of all their
references to the literature. Work on GMM should be more careful in avoiding dismissing
valuable and important work carried out on general morphology and biometry. I also think that
the Davis 1980 paper contains much more valuable information highly relevant to the current
submission and should be therefore used more extensively. This paper is widely used and other
papers have also dealt with teeth (e.g. Armitage’s attempt to identify mules in Roman London) so
the frequent reference in the submission to the fact that the possibility of using teeth for
identification is “redeemed” is not entirely accurate, many of us have never discounted it. Also
there has been widespread understanding of the fact that problematic wears were only those of
the very young or old animals.
In the supplementary material it would be useful to clarify from which museum collections the
specimens considered for this study derive (the codes only allow us to guess, in some cases).
Please note that I could not open the third of the three SOM (I do not have relevant software).

I have minor concerns/observations/suggestions regarding the clarity of some
sentences/parragraphs:
1. I believe the sentence in lines 23-27 in Page 3 could be reformulated. This sentence states that
"Wild asses include the African wild ass... and its domestic form the donkey...., the Asian wild
asses (Equus kiang and Equus hemionus) and several recognised subspecies of E. hemionus". In
my view, the several subspecies are not in addition to the E. hemionus mentioned first but a part
of it. Therefore I think the sentence should reflect this (e.g. "... the Asian wild asses, Equus kiang
and E. hemionus, the latter comprising several recognised subspecies").
2. In my opinion, the sentence in Page 3 line 39 could be slightly modified by adding the words
'relatively limited' to read " the relatively limited biodiversity in contemporary equine species...."
in order to enhance the contrast between past and present diversities.
3. In page 4, lines 47-54 could be reformulated for the sake of clarity (a suggestion: " However,
this approach is restricted to areas and/or periods conducive to the preservation of ancient DNA;
this would usually -but not always - exclude warm environments such as.....").
4. The sentence in Page 5 lines 24-31 appears somewhat unclear. I am unsure whether the authors
meant appropiate, rather than inappropiate (otherwise, the begining of the sentence with
'Though' and the last part of the sentence would, in my view, not make sense). In the same page,
line 39-41: perhaps it should use the word 'was' rather than 'were'?
5. In the references, in some instances the (French) month of publication is included (e.g. Page 22
line 46); I believe this is not the usual format for the Journal?
6. I think it is a bit unclear where each specimen comes from; we have the Codes for the labs in
Table S1, but there is no key for these... (what is NY? what is BM).
In Table 1, the French word Hybride is used; should read Hybrid in English.
Finally, I have a suggestion (perhaps more of a request...) regarding a subject that I find
particularly interesting and relevant form many zooarchaeologists: the identification of mules.
These hybrids are known to have played an essential role in e.g. The Roman Empire and in
Medieval times. Can the authors add a final comment on the feasibility/reliability of their results
in regards to the identification of hybrids (i.e. mules?). I am aware that skeletons of these hybrids
are very difficult to come by and thus the extent of the morphological variability in this 'species'
is not well understood. Would the authors regard their method as reliable for the identification of

this?

This paper makes a useful contribution to the paleontological study of one of the most

famously records an evolutionary transformation from small five-toed animals to modern horses,
zebras, and asses, and the record of the clade over the last 2 million years is closely associated
with big questions related to climate cycles, speciation, and the evolution of humans. However,
analysis of the last two million years of horse history is hampered by taxonomic uncertainties
related to variability in cheek tooth morphology, which makes up most of the record. The
authors of this manuscript make a major contribution (1) by proposing a workable protocol for
applying geometric morphometrics to the very complex morphology of the crown that can be
used interchangeably on any cheek tooth, and (2) by demonstrating that crown patterns are
closely associated with phylogenetic relationships of modern equids. Unquestionably this
contribution is worth publishing. In my opinion, the methodology is flawlessly applied: the
geometric morphometric analyses are sound, the statistics are fully multivariate (including the K

the crown shape captures the complexity of its shape.
Despite the clarity of the results with living taxa, two important issues will undoubtedly
complicate morphometric interpretation of the fossil record, both of which should be highlighted
somewhere in the paper, probably the discussion. The first is alluded to early in the paper,
namely the effects of wear on shape of the crown pattern. It is wear that makes the equid fossil

discriminate taxa will be strongest when teeth of the same wear stage are available in the fossil

traced back to their common ancestor. The shapes of the living taxa are divergent enough that
they perform well in the statistical analyses, but taxa with less time since common ancestry will
naturally be less distinguishable. For crown equids, this means that morphometric power will
decrease as a function of time before present. I don’t believe either of these issues needs to be

valuable and important work carried out on general morphology and biometry. I also think that
the Davis 1980 paper contains much more valuable information highly relevant to the current
submission and should be therefore used more extensively. This paper is widely used and other
papers have also dealt with teeth (e.g. Armitage’s attempt to identify mules in Roman London) so
the frequent reference in the submission to the fact that the possibility of using teeth for
identification is “redeemed” is not entirely accurate, many of us have never discounted it. Also
there has been widespread understanding of the fact that problematic wears were only those of
the very young or old animals.
In the supplementary material it would be useful to clarify from which museum collections the
specimens considered for this study derive (the codes only allow us to guess, in some cases).

The reliability of dental characters in the taxonomic determination of equids has been a topic of
contention for some time. In my view, this paper is a very interesting and valuable contribution for
palaeontologists and zooarchaeologists towards the settling of this issue. As far as I can judge, the
methodology(ies) is(are) sound and, while a larger number of specimens would have been very
welcome in order to capture a larger proportion of intra-apecies variability, I don't believe that this
addition would have a major impact on the conclusions. The synergy between GMM and genetics is
an important aspect of the contribution and is particularly welcome.
have minor concerns/observations/suggestions regarding the clarity of some
entences/parragraphs:
1. I believe the sentence in lines 23-27 in Page 3 could be reformulated. This sentence states that
Wild asses include the African wild ass... and its domestic form the donkey...., the Asian wild asses
Equus kiang and Equus hemionus) and several recognised subspecies of E. hemionus". In my view,
he several subspecies are not in addition to the E. hemionus mentioned first but a part of it.
Therefore I think the sentence should reflect this (e.g. "... the Asian wild asses, Equus kiang and E.
hemionus, the latter comprising several recognised subspecies").
Reply : We have rephrased our previous statement following the reviewer’s suggestion.
2. In my opinion, the sentence in Page 3 line 39 could be slightly modified by adding the words
relatively limited' to read " the relatively limited biodiversity in contemporary equine species...." in
order to enhance the contrast between past and present diversities.
Done.
3. In page 4, lines 47-54 could be reformulated for the sake of clarity (a suggestion: " However, this
approach is restricted to areas and/or periods conducive to the preservation of ancient DNA; this
would usually -but not always - exclude warm environments such as.....").
4. The sentence in Page 5 lines 24-31 appears somewhat unclear. I am unsure whether the authors
meant appropiate, rather than inappropiate (otherwise, the begining of the sentence with 'Though'
and the last part of the sentence would, in my view, not make sense). In the same page, line 39-41:
perhaps it should use the word 'was' rather than 'were'?
Reply : We agree with the reviewer and have now clarified our previous sentences, now reading:
“The characters based on enamel patterns have long since been considered inappropriate to
distinguish Pleistocene and Holocene horses (40), given that both age and wearing represent limiting
actors for evolutionary (17) or taxonomic (25) reconstructions.”
“In addition, the basis of the shape of this occlusal enamel pattern was found to support a reliable
assignment of the various source populations (45), which pleads for further investigations aimed at
econstructing the history of horse breeding.”
5. In the references, in some instances the (French) month of publication is included (e.g. Page 22
ine 46); I believe this is not the usual format for the Journal?
Reply : The reviewer is correct. Such instances have now been checked and corrected.
6. I think it is a bit unclear where each specimen comes from; we have the Codes for the labs in Table
S1, but there is no key for these... (what is NY? what is BM).
Reply : We are thankful to the reviewer 1 for spotting that mistake. We now have made the
equested information available by including the full name of the Institution in the file
“SI_IDspecimens_revised”.
n Table 1, the French word Hybride is used; should read Hybrid in English.
Done.
Finally, I have a suggestion (perhaps more of a request...) regarding a subject that I find particularly
nteresting and relevant form many zooarchaeologists: the identification of mules. These hybrids are
known to have played an essential role in e.g. The Roman Empire and in Medieval times. Can the
authors add a final comment on the feasibility/reliability of their results in regards to the
dentification of hybrids (i.e. mules?). I am aware that skeletons of these hybrids are very difficult to
come by and thus the extent of the morphological variability in this 'species' is not well understood.
Would the authors regard their method as reliable for the identification of mules/hinnies? is the
tudy of further specimens of this 'type' necessary in order to determine this?
That is an important question indeed. Our results clearly show that the hybrids of our dataset (only 4
mules) show an intermediate phenotype between asses and horses in the molars, but not in
premolars. This strongly suggests that the phenotypic signature of hybridization is encapsulated in
he enamel outline and can be used to investigate the occurrence of mules in the archaeological
ecord following a statistical predictive approach. Going further would require a greater sample size
of mules from different geographic origin, which goes well beyond the main scope of the present
tudy.

This is a rigorous paper that performs a very useful function. It is the first paper that clearly
demonstrates that enamal fold patterning in equid teeth do preserve a phenotypic ralationship that
can be used to seperate species, and that this is generally not obscured by issues of differing tooth
wear. Whilst other work has suggested the potential for this approach, the reliability and basis have
been questioned. This paper will become the key one cited to provide the sound basis for this type of
approach. This paper will be of interest to zoologists, palaeontologists, archaeologists and
geneticists. The samples appear to be adequate, and, whilst I am not a statistics specialist, I perceive
his work to be robust in this respect and in line with other high quality work in the field of GMM.
The illustrations are clear and appropriate. An excellent paper.
recommend publication with one very slight modification. The statement on page 14, line 34, that
GMM approaches "completely" resolve environmental confounding factors in phylogenetic signals
needs more qualification. This paragraphs referes to these problems in both bones and teeth. I think
he issues described are really only resolved in teeth that do not remodel plastically in life. Bones
certainly undergo shape change, as well as size differences, related to environment and activity.
Perhaps this is less of a problem in joint enclosed bones (e.g. astragalus) but long bone robusticity
and muscle attachments are certainly prone to shape change that could affect GMM. Horse teeth, in
heir structure, are not prone to much variation through wear, but in many other species wear levels
would problably confound enamel patterning. The statement is true in a narrower sense.
Reply : We completely agree with the reviewer 2 that bones will interact in a greater extent with
heir biomechanic environment than teeth. We have therefore changed the paragraph to focus
exclusively on teeth. It nows reads:
“Traditional morphological analyses have insofar provided invaluable information to paleontologists
and zooarchaeologists for documenting the evolutionary history of equids, and remain key for future
nvestigation. However, these approaches face two main limitations in their ability to capture the
entire geometry of equine teeth and to disentangle the size from the shape component of their form
variation. As the environmental impacts on the size variation of the skeleton in mammals(67), it can
also potentially confound the phylogenetic and population signals retrieved from morphological data
48,68). GMM approaches have contributed to resolve these long-lasting caveats by enabling the
eparate extraction of the size and shape components of biological forms such as teeth, redeeming the
use of morphological variation in synergy with palaeogenetic analyses to investigate macro- and
microevolution processes in the paleontological and archaeological records (32,46,69).”

This paper makes a useful contribution to the paleontological study of one of the most remarkable
model systems in evolutionary biology, the horse. The fossil record of horses famously records an
evolutionary transformation from small five-toed animals to modern horses, zebras, and asses, and
he record of the clade over the last 2 million years is closely associated with big questions related to
climate cycles, speciation, and the evolution of humans. However, analysis of the last two million
years of horse history is hampered by taxonomic uncertainties related to variability in cheek tooth
morphology, which makes up most of the record. The authors of this manuscript make a major
complex morphology of the crown that can be used interchangeably on any cheek tooth, and (2) by
demonstrating that crown patterns are closely associated with phylogenetic relationships of modern
equids. Unquestionably this contribution is worth publishing. In my opinion, the methodology is
lawlessly applied: the geometric morphometric analyses are sound, the statistics are fully
multivariate (including the K statistic used to measure phylogenetic component of variance), and the
protocol for landmarking the crown shape captures the complexity of its shape.
Despite the clarity of the results with living taxa, two important issues will undoubtedly complicate
morphometric interpretation of the fossil record, both of which should be highlighted somewhere in
he paper, probably the discussion. The first is alluded to early in the paper, namely the effects of
wear on shape of the crown pattern. It is wear that makes the equid fossil record notoriously
difficult to interpret, and the morphometric solutions proposed here are successful because they are
applied only to teeth of the same wear stage. Thus their power to discriminate taxa will be strongest
when teeth of the same wear stage are available in the fossil record.
Reply : We completely agree with David Polly. Of note, we already published a study addressing the
effect of Age and wear of the shape variation of the enamel pattern in mandibular teeth in modern
horse populations (Seetah et al 2014).This study concluded to no detectable and significant effect.
We thus refrained to make the demonstration again in this new study but refer instead to the
original publication. For the sake of transparency, we provide below the main results for two cheek
eeth in a horse population. We considered these results to be applicable to the whole mandibular
ooth row.
The second is that taxa will predictably become less distinct in shape as their lineages are traced back
o their common ancestor. The shapes of the living taxa are divergent enough that they perform well
n the statistical analyses, but taxa with less time since common ancestry will naturally be less
distinguishable. For crown equids, this means that morphometric power will decrease as a function
of time before present. I don’t believe either of these issues needs to be discussed in great depth,
offered in the discussion and conclusion.
Reply: We agree with David Polly and we have included a paragraph in the discussion to stress this
mportant issue for future work on the fossil record:
“The power of GM for taxonomic discrimination of early equids based on cheek teeth remains,
however, to be demonstrated. GM has proved to be suitable to address non-dental evolution of early
axa of the family (73), but when applied to cheek teeth of crown equids such an approach may be less
discriminant due to their less divergent morphology.”
Otherwise, I have only a few minor suggestions as follows:
p. 2, lines 30-31: this should say either “with the K statistic” or “with K statistics”. (and again on p. 6,
ines 3-5). In both places I suggest adding that you are using the multivariate K statistic, which is an
mportant piece of information.
Done.
p. 6, line 55: “cameras” does not need an apostrophe here because it is a simple plural.
Done.
p. 9, line 58: it is ok to cite Klingenberg and Gidazewski here, but the original paper to project a
phylogenetic tree into geometric morphometric space, to the best of my knowledge, was Rohlf
2002).

This is a very good paper providing us with a valuable tool for identifying, anatomically and
axonomically, different isolated equid check teeth. It is well structured and carefully researched.
am neither an expert of statistics or GMM so there are some of the more technical aspects of the
paper on which I cannot provide a fully informed evaluation.
think the paper can be accepted with very minor revisions.
find that the aims of the research are not made sufficiently clear. There is some confusion between
he zooarchaeological and paleontological aspects and the reference to the domestication and
conservation issues is just a distraction, which should be avoided. The way I understand it, this paper
provides a tool for the anatomical and taxonomic separation of equid mandibular cheek teeth, which
eems important enough without having to elaborate further (and is valuable for both
palaeontologists and zooarchaeologists). Then there is the evolutionary/phylogenetic aspect, which
epresents a correlated, but distinct theme. I think better clarity is necessary.
Reply:
We have clarified the research findings and their implications for further research in the summary,
now reading:
“We found clear evidence for the relevance of dental phenotypes to accurately discriminate all modern
members of the genus Equus and capture their phylogenetic relationships. These results redeem the
use of dental morphology as a key marker for the anatomical and taxonomic separation of equine
mandibular cheek teeth. These results are valuable for both paleontologists and zooarchaeologists
exploring the spatial and temporal dynamics of the evolutionary history of the horse family, up to the
atest domestication trajectories of horses and donkeys.”
n Methods some explanation should be provided of why the paper focuses on mandibular teeth and
on the P3-M2 sequence. I can see the reasons but I don’t think the reader should be left guessing.
Reply :This is already explained and quoted in the introduction page 6:
“Our first objective was to propose a single GMM protocol to capture the form of the occlusal
enamel patterns of the four mandibular cheek teeth (P/3, P/4, M/1, M/2) used in species
dentification of equid remains (15,37).”
p.14: initial part of the discussions comes across as a bit cocky. Traditional biometry and morphology
have provided very valuable information that is still very useful. GMM should be seen as an
additional tool that is integrated with such approaches, rather than as a way to completely overtake
past morphometric approaches, which would be a grave mistake.
Reply: We totally agree with reviewer 4 and we are grateful for the opportunity provided to clarify
ourselves. We have modified the corresponding paragraph as follows:
and zooarchaeologists for documenting the evolutionary history of equids, and remain key for future
nvestigation. However, these approaches face two main limitations in their ability to capture the
entire geometry of equine teeth and to disentangle the size from the shape component of their form

use of morphological variation in synergy with palaeogenetic analyses to investigate macro- and
microevolution processes in the paleontological and archaeological records (32,46,69).”
p.15: “For example, the criterion proposed by Davis (40) to separate zebras from asses and horses is
he penetration of the ectoflexid up to the linguaflexid folds. According to our study, this criterion is
only applicable to the molars and not the premolars”.
This statement worried me because, far from being a new consideration, this is exactly what Davis
wrote in his 1980 paper, and the issue is well known to everybody who has used the morphology of
check teeth to separate equid species. It is obviously beyond the possibilities of a reviewer to check
hat all the literature has been quoted accurately but the above mistake should ring an alarm bell
and I would encourage the authors to double check the accuracy of all their references to the
iterature.
Reply: Regarding the sentence quoted in page 15 we agree that it should be rephrased since the
Table 2. P 294 of Davis 1980 state that the Buccal fold penetration towards the internal folds does
not occur in premolars of Modern Zebra from The Natural history Museum of Paris and London. This
has been corrected in the present manuscript:
“For example, the criterion the penetration of the ectoflexid up to the linguaflexid folds to separate
ebras from asses and horses is only applicable to the molars and not the premolars, supporting
previous morphoscopic observations (37).”
Work on GMM should be more careful in avoiding dismissing valuable and important work carried
out on general morphology and biometry. I also think that the Davis 1980 paper contains much more
valuable information highly relevant to the current submission and should be therefore used more
extensively. This paper is widely used and other papers have also dealt with teeth (e.g. Armitage’s
attempt to identify mules in Roman London) so the frequent reference in the submission to the fact
hat the possibility of using teeth for identification is “redeemed” is not entirely accurate, many of us
have never discounted it. Also there has been widespread understanding of the fact that problematic
wears were only those of the very young or old animals.
Reply: We are thankful to reviewer 4 for raising this issue, which allows us to rephrase and correct
his misunderstanding. Our point was not to dismiss traditional morphometric, which is and remains
a key approach in morphometry despite its imitation to capture the complexity of a biological form.
We considered that morphometric approach had to be redeemed in the face of evolutionary
esearch where they have been disregarded for palaeogenetic approach only.
To clarify this we have rephrased the first paragraph of the discussion.
