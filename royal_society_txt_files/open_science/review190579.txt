Thank for the opportunity to review the article “Role of Pulping Process As Synergistic
Treatment on Performance of Agro-based Activated Carbons” which addresses a fashionable
research topic, relevant and important.
I appreciate the experimental work in the paper, but I do not feel that this research throw new
light that deserves publication in a journal devoted to the development of scientific knowledge.
My major concerns regarding the content of the article are related to:
- the originality and novelty of the manuscript - the main objectives of the manuscript, producing
AC from agricultural wastes has already been developed in many patents, research articles (DOI:

Basta et al., studied the role of pulping process as synergistic treatment on performance of agro-
based activated carbons. The adsorption performance of the different prepared ACs was
evaluated in terms of Iodine Numbers and their sorption properties for removing the methylene
blue from aqueous solutions. Overall, this is a well-written manuscript with comprehensive and
novel results. I suggest minor revision with following additions:
(1) Please note that Tables 2-7 contain measured data with significant digits which are not
possible in field and even laboratory measurements. The data were apparently truncated with a
spreadsheet. Please reduce the number of significant digits in these tables and possibly in the
main text based on the accuracy and precision of the measurements. Please consult with an
expert or search online (e.g., Google) on what significant digit means. Please note that significant
digits are not equivalent to decimal places except that there is only zero before the decimal point.

This manuscript presented an experimental study to determine the effect of three pulping
pretreatment processes on the property and performance of activated carbon produced from
locally available rice straw (RS) and sugar cane bagasse (SCB). Preparation of agro-based
activated carbon has been a hot research topic and has been extensively evaluated in previous
studies. Although incremental, there were some novel aspects in the present work regarding the
combination of raw materials and pretreatment processes. Thus, this study would add values to
the research field. However, the authors should significantly revise and expand their discussion
in the context of relevant previous studies, both in the Introduction and Results and discussion
4
sections. For instance, the Results and discussion section reads more like a simple description of
the experimental results, and the authors did not sufficiently discuss their results with previous
studies; the novelty of the present work needs to be highlighted more as well.

Answer
Thanks for the comments and your time
* With regards to Reviewer’s view about the novelty, we agree well with the viewpoint that
many articles reported on the utilizing the agricultural wastes in production of activated
carbons, but the work in the submitted article does not focus on using available agricultural
wastes as precursors for ACs but it deals with changing the constituents of RS & SCB via
applying different pulping processes (alkali, sulphite and neutral sulphite), and
evaluating their role on quality of the produced AC. The changes in chemical constituents
were estimated by many techniques available to us (chemical analyses, elemental analyses,
thermal analysis, FT-IR spectra). In the manuscript, we illustrated that changes in the pulping
process is effective on the particular sorption properties of RS and SCB based ACs.
Interestingly, pulping process is a profound modification of the SCB based fibers, where it
induced a clear increase of the specific surface areas of the corresponding ACs even through
their impact on the sorption of methylene blue and iodine.
Moreover, the promising achievements are clear from the adsorption data we submitted in this
paper, superior to the literature reported data dealing with agro-based ACs using H3PO4 as
activator (we summarized it in Table 8).
* with regard to Reviewer comment "- the methods used for the characterization of the
materials reported and the validity of the work are not appropriate to the experiments, instead
of references 33-35, I suggest TAPPI Methods, ISO standards, or established method from the
1
literature; for the sorption properties, I recommend DOI: 10.4324/9780203762264,
10.1016/C2016-0-01974-5"
Answer
The Standard tests to evaluate the adsorption capacity of any carbon material are focused
on studying its surface area, as well as its adsorption capacity to methylene blue and
iodine value. These tests were conducted as an indicator to the efficiency of carbon
materials to remove the contaminants from liquids, especially dyes. These evaluations are
reported in many literatures. Moreover, these tests were performed in such a way that we
can compare the obtained results with the previous performed ACs from RS and SCB
pulps, which were evaluated by the very same tests (and available for us).
We have misunderstood the point raised by reviewer#1 who recommended articles such as
:
DOI: 10.4324/9780203762264 & DOI: 10.1016/C2016-0-01974-5"
These chapters focus on "Potential of Biochar for Managing Metal Contaminated Areas, in
Synergy With Phytomanagement or Other Management Options"
DOI: 10.1016/C2016-0-01974-5"is also a chapter dealing the potential for using biochar
in phytomanagement and to control uptake of hazardous trace elements in agriculture. A
final section focuses on the relatively limited field of experience that is available today.
We do not see the clear and direct relationship of these interesting publications with our
experimental study. We decided not to include these references.
Reviewer: 2
Basta et al., studied the role of pulping process as synergistic treatment on performance of
agro-based activated carbons. The adsorption performance of the different prepared ACs was
evaluated in terms of Iodine Numbers and their sorption properties for removing the
methylene blue from aqueous solutions. Overall, this is a well-written manuscript with
comprehensive and novel results. I suggest minor revision with following additions:
Answer
Thank you about your recommendation which give us the opportunity to extend our
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
(1) Please note that Tables 2-7 contain measured data with significant digits which are not
possible in field and even laboratory measurements. The data were apparently truncated
with a spreadsheet. Please reduce the number of significant digits in these tables and
possibly in the main text based on the accuracy and precision of the measurements. Please
consult with an expert or search online (e.g., Google) on what significant digit means.
Please note that significant digits are not equivalent to decimal places except that there is
only zero before the decimal point.
Answer : This comment is important as spreadsheet allows many digits induced by successive
calculations, even though they do not have any physical meaning. In the Table caption, we
have included that the accuracy of the measurements related in Table 2 is 0.01% for the
elemental analyses and 0.1°C for TGA measurements. In Table 4, the IR characteristics
MHBS and Cr.I. can be estimated with a precision of 0.01 whereas the textural analyses
display the figures usually reported in many other publications. In Tables 6 and 7, the r 2
parameter is provided with the usual four figures, precise enough to discriminate between
different models. We therefore modified the data in the manuscript accordingly and we
apologize for having provided raw spreadsheet data.
(2) Please also take in account some important publications related to thermochemical
conversion of agro-based feed-stocks to value-added products.

This manuscript presented an experimental study to determine the effect of three pulping
pretreatment processes on the property and performance of activated carbon produced from
locally available rice straw (RS) and sugar cane bagasse (SCB). Preparation of agro-based
activated carbon has been a hot research topic and has been extensively evaluated in previous
studies. Although incremental, there were some novel aspects in the present work regarding
the combination of raw materials and pretreatment processes. Thus, this study would add
values to the research field. However, the authors should significantly revise and expand their
discussion in the context of relevant previous studies, both in the Introduction and Results and
discussion sections. For instance, the Results and discussion section reads more like a simple
description of the experimental results, and the authors did not sufficiently discuss their
results with previous studies; the novelty of the present work needs to be highlighted more as

Answer
Thank you so much for your suggestion and your efforts to improve our submitted article,
which give us the opportunity to extent our publication in Royal Society Open Science.
With regard to your opinion "the authors should significantly revise and expand their
discussion in the context of relevant previous studies, both in the Introduction and Results and
discussion sections.
We would like to clarify that, we focused on evaluating the quality of produced activated
carbons versus the changes in chemical analyses, which were performed via different pulping
processes. This study was carried out to recommend the pulping process on agro-waste which
will be promising in carbon production. Further evaluation was carried out via comparing our
finding data with the literature reported data dealing with agro-based ACs. We gathered these
comparisons in Table 8.
Finally, thanks again for all efforts by editorial staff and reviewers, and we hope that the
revised version of our manuscript (LORD willing) meets the high standard of your Journal.
