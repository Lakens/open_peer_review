This is a poor paper of limited scope and impact, and is not suitable for publication in the Royal
Society Open Science.
The paper presents and discusses data on SDS / DTAB mixtures at a superficial level. Surfactant
mixing, even in the presence of other additives, has been extensively studies and reported; and
this includes anionic / cationic mixtures. This paper adds nothing of significance to that extensive
literature.
Furthermore the authors seem unaware of the recent developments in advanced experimental
techniques to study surfactant mixing at interfaces and in micelles, and use only a rather dated
and limited approach. They also seem unaware of the developments in the application of the
pseudo phase approximation to surfactant mixing, and make no attempt to quantify the extent of
the synergy in the mixing.
The derived data in table 4 contains quite unrealistic errors, and indicate lack of critical
evaluation of the data.
It is not at all clear what the DLS measurements indicate and how they are interpreted in terms of
surfactant self-assembly.
To even publish this work in a more specialist and appropriate journal would require an
enormous amount of re-evaluation and revision.

Adjudicative reviewer’s comments:
This manuscript (RSOS 181979) authored by K. M. Sachin, et al reports their study on a catanionic
surfactant system consisting of DTAB and SDS. They have studied several characteristics of this
mixed surfactant system such as CMC, Krafft point, dispersibility and stability of the SDS-rich
and DTAB-rich solutions in the presence and absence of dyes, methyl orange (MO) and
methylene blue (MB). In this sense, it’s a paper of broad scope and can make a notable
contribution in the science of surfactants. They have fixed their research question based on an
exhaustive literature survey and the subject seems to be a relevant one. The change in CMC value
as observed in their study supports the assertion that this mixed surfactant system can have
practical applications. They have employed appropriate techniques, e.g., surface tension
measurement, conductivity measurement, spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering, etc. for
their study. Therefore, scientifically, this paper is sound. But it possesses several grammatical/
writing style flaws which the authors must correct. I also suggest a careful revision of the
technical aspects stated in my comments, given below, and expect appropriate answers to the
questions raised there. I recommend publishing this article in the journal Royal Society Open
Science once the authors make an appropriate revision.
Comments related to the subject matter
1. Page 3, Line 28, 29- What does “micellization of Gibb’s free energy” mean? Is it “Gibb’s free
energy of micellization” instead? Please check.
2. Page 3, Line 36 to 46- It is understandable that there is a lack of literature related to the effects
of dyes on these surfactants. Apart from that, what are the other factors that necessitate such a
study, i.e., why the effects of dyes on these surfactant systems need to be known; is it for the need
of industries or some other practical reasons? If there is a practical reason for enriching literature
in this subject, please write.
3. Page 4- Table 1 in the “Materials” section seems unnecessary. Please remove it unless just
mentioning purities of the chemicals is not enough.
4. Page 8, Line 45-57- CMC of both SDS-rich and DTAB-rich formulations seem to be less than
4
that of the individual surfactants. It seems to be an important character. But a discussion
regarding the significance of this change is lacking. The conclusion of the paper also does not
include this aspect.
5. Page 14, Line 24- Synergistic effect, which is a desirable character in surfactant mixtures, from
the practical viewpoint, is mentioned in this line. But its broader discussion is lacking in the
manuscript and the conclusion also does not put an emphasis on it.
6. Page 11, Line 17-22- It is written that Amin increases from 62.10 Å2 to 49.70Å2. Please check it.
7. Page 12, Line 14 and Line 49- Spelling of the cited author’s name is wrong.
8. Page 21, Line 10-14- Is the finding mentioned in these lines your own finding or that of
reference 91? Please write more clearly.
9. Page 21, Line 35-38- These lines, combined with Line 42-45 on page 24 means that the
interaction between MO and DTAB-rich solution is weak, but still, it is stronger than the
interaction between MB and DTAB-rich. Please write it more clearly so that these two statements
do not sound contradictory to each other.
10. DTAB forms complex with MO which is not a desirable character for the functioning of
surfactants. You seem to have tried to justify this on page 29 and 30, but the statement is unclear.
Please discuss more clearly, why, despite the formation of a complex, this formulation is
important.
11. Study of the effects of MO and MB is not properly justified. What notable properties were
observed in these studies? Was there a synergistic or antagonistic interaction, or anything else
that is interesting?
12. Elaborate how the <U+03B6> potential and hydrodynamic diameter provide information about the
stability and dispersibility of these formulations. You may enrich your discussion with the help of
some recent publications, e.g., those on phospholipids containing a charged additive.
13. Please make your conclusion more informative by incorporating several aspects of the study
that are discussed in the document. Some examples are as follows-
i. How CMC of the system changes compared to the individual surfactant solutions.
ii. How do the <U+03B6> potential and PDI values reflect the stability of dispersion?
iii. How does the stability of the solutions with and without dyes compare with each other?
14. The term “matches with the literature” is used too often while citing literatures. Please find
appropriate substitutes, e.g., “agrees with….”, “same as…”, “similar to…”, “corresponds to….”,
“close to…”, etc.
15. If possible, limit the number of author names to fewer in citations and use only numbers for
that purpose as long as possible.
Comments related to language
16. Please consider revising the following sentences for grammatical/ writing-style flaws:
Line 17-18, page 2: “The synergism happens for the formation of mixed micelle as the
CMC of mixed systems is less than to the pure system.” is unclear or wrong.
Line 9-12, page 3:
The sentence “The researchers have been reported on the interaction study of the mixed
surfactants in the presence of salts in different medium by using several methods.” is unclear and
wrong.
Line 16-17, page 3- The sentence “But they were not reported the effect of temperature on CMC as
well as all the thermodynamics and surface properties.” is wrong, consider revising it.
Line 37, page 3- The sentence “Earlier studies have been reported the effect of dyes on the single
surfactant” is wrong, consider revising it.
Line 37-40, page 3- The sentence
5
“Samiey and Ashoori [54] have been determined only the kinetic and thermodynamic
studies in the presence of crystal violet with DTAB and SDS separately.” is wrong, correct it; also
correct each sentence following it in the same paragraph.
Page 12, Line 53-58- The sentence “Nevertheless, with increasing the temperature, the P
values decreases for both DTAB-rich and SDS-rich system because of increasing the kinetic
energy of the molecules which could be induced oscillation (vibrational, rotational and
translational) and decrease the binding forces [67].” is wrong. Please avoid the use of passive
voice in such an inappropriate way at other places too.
Page 13, Line 17-19- The sentence “But the value of <U+0394>Goads for SDS-rich in water is
found to be decrease as -45.29 kJmol <U+2015>1 (table 3) at 298.15 K.” is wrong.
Page 13, Line 26- Here and at all other places, please keep a space on both sides of the
equality sign (=).
Page 15, Line 53, 54- The sentence “The more negative of <U+0394>Gom means the more
spontaneous and micellization will feasible” is wrong.
17. Also, carefully revise the document for other language-related errors by yourself.
Comments as an adjudicative reviewer.
1. I agree with reviewer-2’s comment.
2. Regarding reviewer-1’s comments, I have following opinions.
i. Regarding the scope and impact of the paper, since it covers a study on a broad range of
parameters, I think its scope is not so limited if a proper revision is done.
ii. Regarding the superficial level of discussion on the data, if they incorporate the
recommendations mentioned above, I hope this will be improved.
iii. Regarding synergy, DLS measurements, etc., I have mentioned in my comments and if they
are able to revise appropriately, these problems can be solved.
iv. I suggest the authors to consider the points raised by reviewer-1, too, while revising their
manuscript.
v. Regarding appropriacy of the manuscript for the journal, I think it is appropriate to publish
after revision.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Response to reviewer 1
We have been highly benefited by the valuable expressions of the reviews
about the quality of our paper.
The paper presents and discusses data on SDS / DTAB mixtures at a
superficial level. Surfactant mixing, even in the presence of other
additives, has been extensively studies and reported; and this includes
anionic / cationic mixtures. This paper adds nothing of significance to
that extensive literature.
Ans: We are very happy with the observation of the respectful reviewer who
has deep knowledge in our fields. So, we have done corrections in the revised
manuscript.
Furthermore the authors seem unaware of the recent developments in
advanced experimental techniques to study surfactant mixing at
interfaces and in micelles, and use only a rather dated and limited
approach. They also seem unaware of the developments in the application
of the pseudo phase approximation to surfactant mixing, and make no
attempt to quantify the extent of the synergy in the mixing.
Ans We agreed with the suggestions given by the respectful reviewer and
applied following explanation in our revised manuscript which are given
below:
On the explanation for synergetic effect, we tried our mixed CMC data by
coupling the pseudo phase separation model with a regular solution
approximation which was proposed by Rubingh [Holland, P. M.; Rubingh, D.
N. J. Phys. Chem. 1983, 87, 1984- 1990] and Rosen et al [Rosen, M. J.; Hua,
X. Y. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1982, 86, 164- 172] and was not able to give
completely satisfactory results for mixed CMC. So, we did not try on the
model of Motomura et al [Motomura, K.; Yamanaka, M.; Aratono, M. Colloid
Polym. Sci. 1984, 262, 948-955] though the model is in the view of
thermodynamics and also takes into account dissociation of ionic surfactants
but the model does not deal with the surfactant interaction parameter.
Eventually, we got success to apply the theoreotical model that is the pseudo
phase separation model which is coupled with the dissociated Margules Model
[Eads, C. D.; Robosky, L. C. Langmuir 1999, 15, 2661-2668, Hu, J.; Zhou,
L.; Feng, J.; Liu, H.; Hu, Y. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2007, 315, 761-767,
Hao, L.-S et al., The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2012, 116(17), 5213–
5225] which gives satisfactory description of the mixed CMC as well as
surfactant interaction parameter.
The derived data in table 4 contains quite unrealistic errors, and indicate
lack of critical evaluation of the data.
Ans: We have corrected and incorporated in the revised manuscript.
It is not at all clear what the DLS measurements indicate and how they
are interpreted in terms of surfactant self-assembly.
Ans: We really appreciate the valuable note of the reviewer and we have
corrected and adequately incorporated needful science in the manuscript. Such
guidelines from reviewer really make the new landmarks for fitting our paper
in most scientific ensembles with high impact and self-explanatory meaning
and understanding.
To even publish this work in a more specialist and appropriate journal
would require an enormous amount of re-evaluation and revision.
Ans: We have done enormous correction and revision in each and every
aspects of our revised manuscript.
Response to reviewer 2
1. Appropriately reducing the number of references
Ans: We have reduced the number of references in the revised manuscript.
Response to reviewer 3
Comments related to the subject matter
1. Page 3, Line 28, 29- What does “micellization of Gibb’s free energy”
mean? Is it “Gibb’s free energy of micellization” instead? Please check.
Ans: It will be mistake if we use micellization of Gibb’s free energy instead
of Gibb’s free energy of micellization . So, the needful corrections are made
and are incorporated in the revised manuscript.
2. Page 3, Line 36 to 46- It is understandable that there is a lack of
literature related to the effects of dyes on these surfactants. Apart from
that, what are the other factors that necessitate such a study, i.e., why the
effects of dyes on these surfactant systems need to be known; is it for the
need of industries or some other practical reasons? If there is a practical
reason for enriching literature in this subject, please write.
Ans: It has been a very effective suggestion and is now incorporated in the
revised manuscript.
3. Page 4- Table 1 in the “Materials” section seems unnecessary.
Please remove it unless just mentioning purities of the chemicals is not
enough.
Ans: Corrections have incorporated in the revised manuscript.
4. Page 8, Line 45-57- CMC of both SDS-rich and DTAB-rich
formulations seem to be less than that of the individual surfactants. It
seems to be an important character. But a discussion regarding the
significance of this change is lacking. The conclusion of the paper also
does not include this aspect.
Ans: We have applied different models in the revised manuscript to explain
the synergistic effect for mixed CMC of our systems and also included the
findings in the conclusion section.
5. Page 14, Line 24- Synergistic effect, which is a desirable character
in surfactant mixtures, from the practical viewpoint, is mentioned in this
line. But its broader discussion is lacking in the manuscript and the
conclusion also does not put an emphasis on it.
Ans: We really appreciate the valuable note of the referee and we have
corrected and incorporated in the revised manuscript.
6. Page 11, Line 17-22- It is written that Amin increases from 62.10
Å2 to 49.70Å2. Please check it.
Ans: These are very effective observations which are efficiently incorporated
in the revised manuscript.
7. Page 12, Line 14 and Line 49- Spelling of the cited author’s

Ans: Corrections have incorporated in the revised manuscript.
8. Page 21, Line 10-14- Is the finding mentioned in these lines your

Ans: The finding mentioned in these lines (10-14 of Page 21) is not our
findings but that was of reference 91. So, we have corrected our mistakes.
9. Page 21, Line 35-38- These lines, combined with Line 42-45 on
page 24 means that the interaction between MO and DTAB-rich solution
is weak, but still, it is stronger than the interaction between MB and
DTAB-rich. Please write it more clearly so that these two statements do
not sound contradictory to each other.
Ans: This observation of the reviewer has been an additional pressure on our
minds to further relook and reveals the manifold hidden sciences out of such
observations. The details new interpretations of the study are added in the text.
10. DTAB forms complex with MO which is not a desirable
character for the functioning of surfactants. You seem to have tried to
justify this on page 29 and 30, but the statement is unclear. Please discuss
more clearly, why, despite the formation of a complex, this formulation is
important.
Ans: We really appreciate the valuable note of the referee and we have
corrected and adequately incorporated needful science in the manuscript.
11. Study of the effects of MO and MB is not properly justified. What
notable properties were observed in these studies? Was there a
synergistic or antagonistic interaction, or anything else that is
interesting?
Ans: The working scientific modules and structural abilities derived from
their structural abilities are incorporated in the revised text.
12. Elaborate how the <U+03B6> potential and hydrodynamic diameter provide
information about the stability and dispersibility of these formulations.
You may enrich your discussion with the help of some recent
publications, e.g., those on phospholipids containing a charged
additive.
Ans: Table 4 shows that the -1.708, -15.13 PDI and zeta potential value of
SDS-rich mixed surfactant system. An addition of MB into SDS-rich system,
the PDI is decreased with stronger monodispersity and enhances the stability
of the solution. It indicates that MB and DTAB both contain positive charged
due to the cationic - cationic interaction dominant over the anionic–cationic
interaction. Similar, addition of MO into SDS-rich system, the PDI value is
more decreased with stronger monodispersity as well as potential value
noticed more negative. It infers that the MO and SDS both are negative in
nature, so in this situation DTAB showing stronger interacting ability than
SDS with increased the PDI value with enhance higher monodispersity.
However, due to the higher population of anions observed higher negative
zeta potential. In case of DTAB-rich shows 2.285 PDI value with low
monodispersity and 14.18 zeta potential. It depicted the lower population of
DTAB ions and higher SDS population which could induce weak electrostatic
interaction. An addition of MB into DTAB-rich the decrease of the PDI value
because of MB and DTAB both are cationic in nature with shows higher
monodispersity. Therefore, with MO the PDI is increased because of MO is
anionic nature with weak electrostatic interaction as well as low
monodispersity of the solution. It indicates that the due to the presence of
higher anionic molecules, the surface charge obtained.
13. Please make your conclusion more informative by incorporating
several aspects of the study that are discussed in the document. Some
examples are as follows-
i. How CMC of the system changes compared to the individual
surfactant solutions.
Ans: Corrections have been incorporated in the revised manuscript.
ii. How do the <U+03B6> potential and PDI values reflect the stability of
dispersion?
Ans: Corrections have been incorporated in the revised manuscript.
iii. How does the stability of the solutions with and without dyes
compare with each other?
Ans: These have been a valuable interface and are now adequately attempted.
14.The term “matches with the literature” is used too often while citing
literatures. Please find appropriate substitutes, e.g., “agrees with….”,
“same as…”, “similar to…”, “corresponds to….”, “close to…”, etc.
Ans: The reviewer has suggested very informatory database which are now
incorporated in the revised manuscript.
15. If possible, limit the number of author names to fewer in citations
and use only numbers for that purpose as long as possible.
Ans: Corrections have been incorporated in the revised manuscript.
Comments related to language
16. Please consider revising the following sentences for grammatical/
writing-style flaws:
Line 17-18, page 2: “The synergism happens for the formation of mixed
micelle as the CMC of mixed systems is less than to the pure
system.” is unclear or wrong.
Ans: Corrections have incorporated in the revised manuscript.
Line 9-12, page 3:
The sentence “The researchers have been reported on the interaction
study of the mixed surfactants in the presence of salts in
different medium by using several methods.” is unclear and wrong.
Ans: Corrections have included in the revised manuscript.
Line 16-17, page 3- The sentence “But they were not reported the effect of
temperature on CMC as well as all the thermodynamics and surface
properties.” is wrong, consider revising it.
Ans: Corrections have included in the revised manuscript.
Line 37, page 3- The sentence “Earlier studies have been reported the
effect of dyes on the single surfactant” is wrong, consider revising it.
Ans: Corrections have included in the revised manuscript.
Line 37-40, page 3- The sentence
“Samiey and Ashoori [54] have been determined only the kinetic and
thermodynamic studies in the presence of crystal violet with DTAB
and SDS separately.” is wrong, correct it; also correct each sentence
following it in the same paragraph.
Ans: Corrections have included in the revised manuscript.
Page 12, Line 53-58- The sentence “Nevertheless, with increasing the
temperature, the P values decreases for both DTAB-rich and SDS-
rich system because of increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules
which could be induced oscillation (vibrational, rotational and
translational) and decrease the binding forces [67].” is wrong. Please
avoid the use of passive voice in such an inappropriate way at
other places too.
Ans: Corrections have included in the revised manuscript.
Page 13, Line 17-19- The sentence “But the value of <U+0394>Goads for SDS-rich
in
water is found to be decrease as -45.29 kJmol <U+2015>1 (table 3) at 298.15
K.” is wrong.
Ans: Corrections have included in the revised manuscript.
Page 13, Line 26- Here and at all other places, please keep a space on
both sides of the equality sign (=).
Ans: Corrections have included in the revised manuscript.
Page 15, Line 53, 54- The sentence “The more negative of <U+0394>Gom means
the more spontaneous and micellization will feasible” is wrong.
Ans: Corrections have incorporated in the revised manuscript.
17. Also, carefully revise the document for other language-related
errors by yourself.
Ans: Corrections have included in the revised manuscript.
