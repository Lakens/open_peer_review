The authors developed a unified framework for in-plane free vibration of rectangular plates and
annular sectorial plates. The improved Fourier-Ritz approach is used to derive the global mass
and stiffness matrices. Such an approach has the characteristics of generality, accuracy and
efficiency. The manuscript is well organized and this reviewer recommends its publication if the
authors could address the following issues satisfactorily.
1. The authors claimed their approach to be efficient. Please comment on this in the paper.
2. The authors should thoroughly check the manuscript since there are too many typos.
(1) Line 14 of Page 2: “Shi and Wang et.al [11]” should be “Shi et al. [11]”;

(3) Line 34 of Page 2: “Wang and Shi et al. [27]” should be “Wang et al. [27]”
(4) The format of references is not uniform.
(5) Line 27 of Page 5: “0” and “1” should be written in the subscript.
3. In Table 4, there is large difference between the prediction and the reference for S2S2S2C. Why?

This is actually good and interesting paper on plate in-plane vibrations. After checking for some
typos and some minor corrections it can be accepted. Ref. [22] is not written properly - please
correct. Chapter number of Concluding remarks is 3, but should be 4. There are several mistakes
of this type. After detailed proofreading I suggest acceptance of this paper.

Re: Editor Decision on Paper RSOS-170484 (Research Paper) June 28, 2017
Dear Dr. Alice,
Thank you for sending us reviewer comments on our manuscript “A Generalized Solution
Procedure for In-Plane Free Vibration of Rectangular Plates and Annular Sectorial
Plates” by S. Bao et al. In this letter, we include point-by-point responses to the reviewer
comments and our revisions to the manuscript. All revisions are highlighted in red. We
believe these modifications address all of the inputs from all of the reviewers, and the
revised manuscript is suitable for publication in the Royal Society Open Science.
We thank you in advance for your time and considerations.
Sincerely,

REVIEWER #1
Summary Recommendation: The authors developed a unified framework for in-plane
free vibration of rectangular plates and annular sectorial plates. The improved Fourier-
Ritz approach is used to derive the global mass and stiffness matrices. Such an approach
has the characteristics of generality, accuracy and efficiency. The manuscript is well
organized and this reviewer recommends its publication if the authors could address the
following issues satisfactorily.
Our response: We thank the reviewer for these favorable comments and the invaluable
suggestions for improving the manuscript. We made revisions to address all technical
issues.
Comment #1:
1. The authors claimed their approach to be efficient. Please comment on this in the
paper.
Our response: We thank the reviewer for this . We added some sentences to clarify this
point.
Our modification to the manuscript: We added the following sentences on Page 14:
The presented method improves the efficiency for the sectorial plate in two aspects. First,
the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix in Eq.(34) has the explicit form, which need not
the tedious numerical integration process[27], so it is helpful in generating the global
matrices. Second, in Eq.(25), the terms in the truncated series of this paper is M=N=10,
while the chosen number of M and N are 15 in Ref.[27]. The present method significantly
reduces the computation cost of the eigen-problems for the matrix dimension in Eq.(34)
is 4/9 of that in Ref.[27],which does not use the logarithmic radial variable.
Comment #2: The authors should thoroughly check the manuscript since there are too
many typos.
(1) Line 14 of Page 2: “Shi and Wang et.al [11]” should be “Shi et al. [11]”;
(2)Line 16 of Page 2: “Chen and Liu [14]”, but the reference [14] is “R. Holland ….”;
(3) Line 34 of Page 2: “Wang and Shi et al. [27]” should be “Wang et al. [27]”
(4) The format of references is not uniform.
(5) Line 27 of Page 5: “0” and “1” should be written in the subscript.
Our response: We thank the reviewer to pointing this issue. We make some changes in
the paper after examination.
Our modification to the manuscript: we changed some of the Refs. in the revised
version on page 17: “[14] N. Farag, J. Pan, Modal characteristics of in-plane vibration of
circular plates clamped at the outer edge, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 113 (4) (2003) 1935–1946.

vibrations of rectangular and circular plates, Int. J. Eng. Model. 27 (3-4) (2014) 69–84.

sector plates with elastic boundary supports, in: Proceedings of the 2014 Meetings on
Acoustics Acoustical Society of America (2014) 1-5.”
Comment #3: In Table 4, there is large difference between the prediction and the
reference for S2S2S2C. Why?
Our response: We thank the reviewer to pointing this issue. The original program was
written in Matlab software. we run the program for S2S2S2C(Boundary Condition) again
carefully, now the results are very near with Ref[6]. We also rewrite the program in
Mathematica4.0. The results are also very good( with only one or two last digits number
different).
Our modification to the manuscript: we obtained the new data from the program for
S2S2S2C in Table 4 as : “
1.4141 1.5223 2.0081 2.2931 2.3491 2.8060 2.8281 2.9749 3.1979
.” in page 12.
REVIEWER #2
Summary Recommendation: Reviewer #2 Comments
This is actually good and interesting paper on plate in-plane vibrations. After checking
for some typos and some minor corrections it can be accepted. Ref. [22] is not written
properly - please correct. Chapter number of Concluding remarks is 3, but should be 4.
There are several mistakes of this type. After detailed proofreading I suggest acceptance
of this paper.
Our response: We thank the reviewer for these critical comments. We changed what the
reviewer has suggested.
Other changes: we checked all the paper.
First change is in the definition of G12 in page 10 as:“
Gxy = Ey/2/(1-µxµy) (for rectangular plate)
Gr<U+F071> = Arr/2/(1-µrµ<U+F071>) (for annular sectorial plate) (38)
”, also in the capition of Table 4 in page 12:
“Normalized frequency parameter for rectangular square plates with various
boundary conditions (Ex/Ey = 2)”.
There also a mistake in the equation (32) in page 9:
“Useful integration
<U+F0EF><U+F0EC> M mnrs <U+F03D> <U+F072> h e
uu 2 p ln R0
Pmr I ns00
<U+F0ED> vv uu
(32)”
<U+F0EF><U+F0EE> M mnrs <U+F03D> M mnrs
(here we change a symbol in the first equation of (32):
<U+F072> <U+F072> .)
