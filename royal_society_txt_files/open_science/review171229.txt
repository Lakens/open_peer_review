I have read the manuscript entitled “Manganese molybdate nanoflakes on silicon microchannel
plates as novel nano energetic material” by Paul K Chu et al submitted to RSO Science. This
research into a molybdate structure exhibiting a nano morphology is significant. It can bring new
insights to synthesize nanomaterial in an elegant way. Though MnMoO4 as an electrode for
supercapacitors is a well-researched area but the obtained flakes having unique morphology
could be new and the results are publishable. The work is well presented and the manuscript is
fairly well written with neat characterizations. However, some minor revision is required before
rendering a final decision.
• Maybe a good idea to mention the use of this manganese molybdate nanomaterial
(applications?)
• Some parts of the introduction (in particular to nanocrystalline compounds mid first
paragraph) can be shortened.
• Few of the recent work on binary metal oxides (molybdate) need to be included in the second
paragraph of the introduction. DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b03836; DOI: 10.1039/c7dt00139h.
• Section 3.1, usually acetates/nitrates will be used as precursors but here manganese chloride
has been used, please justify in a line or two.
• pH was adjusted to a specific value – please specify the value.
• Please mention the target used in XRD for analysis.
• How were the sample prepared for TEM analysis?

characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, DSC/TGA, etc . The paper includes new and interesting
results, and is suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science after minor technical and
English revisions. The following comments may be considered during revision.
1. The English has to be polished all over the manuscript, there are some grammar errors. For
example, Page 3, Line 1, “Nano crystalline compounds is known as” should be revised as “Nano
crystalline compounds are known as”. Page 4, Lines 11-12, “is proposed to as substrate” may be
revised as “is proposed to act as a substrate”.
2. As for XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1a, a strong peak at 69° was identified as diffraction peak
due to Si (100) crystallographic plane. This identification may not be correct. The peak should be
indexed to Si (400) diffraction peak.

Appendix A
Dear Editor and Referee,
Paper title: Manganese molybdate nanoflakes on silicon microchannel plates
as novel nano energetic material
Reference number: RSOS-171229
Thank you for your letter and for the referee’s comments concerning our manuscript
entitled “Manganese molybdate nanoflakes on silicon microchannel plates as novel
nano energetic material” (ID: RSOS-171229). The comments concerning several
characterizations, detailed discussion and some English expressions of our manuscript
are valuable and helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the
important significance guiding to our researches. Thank you again for your rigorous
and meticulous work.
We have studied the comments carefully and have made adjustment and correction
that to meet the requirements of the expert with positive response. Revised portion are
marked in green background in the paper.
Other corrections as well as the responds to the referee’s comments in the paper are as
following:
Referee: 1
Response to comment:
1. Maybe a good idea to mention the use of this manganese molybdate
nanomaterial (applications?)
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 1. We think twice about the
mistakes in the abstract. It is indeed a good idea to mention the use of this manganese
1
molybdate nanomaterial and the mention parts are marked in green background in
the paper. Currently, since both manganate-oxides and molybdate-oxides materials
are common MIC materials, the nanocrystalline of manganese molybdate is proposed
in an application in the energetic material. Combined with Al as fuel, MnMoO4
nanocrystalline is the oxidizer of thermite materials.
2. Some parts of the introduction (in particular to nanocrystalline compounds
mid first paragraph) can be shortened.
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 1. We think twice about the
comments of cutting down the introduction. Some following parts are shortened. In
particular, the nano energetic materials have dramatical improvement of the energy
release, the reliability in initiation, detonation velocity and charge density. Additional
it also causes the decrease of the explosion critical radius. Nanocrystalline compounds
is known as metastable intermolecular composites (MIC) in the class of thermite
materials, which is pyrotechnic composition of metal powder fuel and oxidizer.
3. Few of the recent work on binary metal oxides (molybdate) need to be
included in the second paragraph of the introduction. DOI:
10.1021/acsami.7b03836; DOI: 10.1039/c7dt00139h.
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 1. We think twice about the
comments of recent works on binary metal oxides. It is very important to quoting
these good recent reports. So we add the following parts which are marked in green
background in the paper. Minakshi et al. synthesized nanoscale ternary molybdate
(Mn0.33Nio0.33Co0.33MoO4) using biopolymer as a precursor to improve the energy
storage performance. Watcharatharapong et al. prepared manganese molybdate
rods with a length of 10 µm.

4. Section 3.1, usually acetates/nitrates will be used as precursors but here
manganese chloride has been used, please justify in a line or two.
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 1. We think twice about the
comments of the precursors. According to ref 1, the Ni adhesion film is prepared using
nickel chloride and ammonium chloride. Manganese chloride is adopted to reduce the
impurity ion.
5. pH was adjusted to a specific value – please specify the value.
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 1. We think twice about the
comments of the pH value. The revised parts are marked in green background in the
paper. The (NH4)6Mo7O24 solution was added slowly to the MnCl2 solution under
stirring to form a homogeneous solution and the pH was adjusted to about 7 by an
NH3 solution.2
6. Please mention the target used in XRD for analysis.
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 1. We think twice about the
comments of the XRD. The revised parts are marked in green background in the
paper. To analyses the phase structure of the sample, the XRD measurement is
conducted.
7. How were the sample prepared for TEM analysis?
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 1.We think twice about the
comments of the sentence. I’m sorry not to describe clearly and the revises are
marked in green background in the paper. The sample with the crystallites shown in
Fig.3a is prepared by ultrasonic in ethanol for a sufficiently long time to make sure
3
the crystallites are detached from the surface. And the nanoflakes sample shown in
Fig. 3b is separated centrifugally from the fragments after etching in the KOH
solution.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.

Referee: 2
Response to comment:
1. The English has to be polished all over the manuscript, there are some
grammar errors. For example, Page 3, Line 1, “Nano crystalline compounds is
known as” should be revised as “Nano crystalline compounds are known as”.
Page 4, Lines 11-12, “is proposed to as substrate” may be revised as “is proposed
to act as a substrate”.
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 2.We think twice about the
comments of grammar errors. I’m sorry for these mistakes, and I look over all the
paper to polish the English. The revises are marked green background in the paper.
Nanocrystalline compounds are known as metastable intermolecular composites (MIC)
in the class of thermite materials, which are pyrotechnic compositions of metal
powder fuels and oxidizers. Hence in this study, a patterned 3D substrate, silicon
microchannel plate, is proposed to act as a substrate due to larger aspect ratio and
better orderliness than Ni foam. Si MCP is arranged with large aspect ratio lattices
with the length of 5 µm and the depth of 300 µm.
2. As for XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1a, a strong peak at 69° was identified as
diffraction peak due to Si (100) crystallographic plane. This identification may
not be correct. The peak should be indexed to Si (400) diffraction peak.
Response: We appreciate the comments by Referee: 2.We think twice about the
comments of XRD errors. I’m sorry for the mistake. The strong peak at 69° is indexed
to Si (100) diffraction peak. The revises are marked green background in the paper. At
the same time, the pattern also presents three Ni peaks: (111) at 44°, (201) at 52°, and
5
(222) at 76° and one strong Si peak: (400) at 69°. (Ni: JCPD card 70-0989 and Si:
JCPD card77-2109). And the Figure is changed as follow.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.

Corresponding changes after careful consideration:
1. The important change in this article is the line 42-55 of page 2, we changed
the “With the rapid development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, the
morphology is one of the important factors for the sensitivity of energetic
materials.5 In particular, when the material is on the nanometer scale, its
physical/chemical performance and the surface properties change
remarkably. It has a dramatical improvement of the energy release, the
reliability in initiation, detonation velocity and charge density.
Nanocrystallization of energetic materials also causes the decrease of the
explosion critical radius.” to “In particular, the nano energetic materials
have dramatical improvement of the energy release, the reliability in
initiation, detonation velocity and charge density. Additional it also causes
the decrease of the explosion critical radius.”.
2. The important change in this article is the line 4-10 of page 3, we changed
