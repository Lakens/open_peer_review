This is an important, evolutionary-scale improvement on Hauber's (2014) paper and also on the
authors' own work published earlier. My comments are only minor:
The abstract: it is not informative. You need to list the most important outcomes of your model in
the abstract (e.g. Line 104 of the main text).
Line 24: please explain what "obvious form of parasitism" is
Line 31, 32, and elsewhere: please use ACCEPTOR host, not accepting host here and throughout
the MS--that's the regular usage in brood parasitism papers.
Line 41: RE-NEST, not re-clutch
Line 45-6: sentence incomplete.
Line 47,-8: what does THIS refer to? Please expand the sentences
Line 98: define conditional acceptor (i.e conditional rejecter)

In this paper the authors develop a model to analyze the interaction between depredatory (i.e.
retaliation or farming) parasites and their hosts, a subject that has previously been modeled many
times. My main worry about this study is that it is very difficult to assess if it provides a
meaningful contribution to the literature because the theoretical background (i.e. contribution
made by previous models) in the Introduction section is too short and, mainly, the Discussion
section is almost inexistent. Thus, (1) the contribution made by previously published models
should be described in more detail, especially the results obtained by Hauber (2014) who also
modeled the effect of both farming and retaliation depredatory behaviours. (2) The relevance of
the results obtained in the present model should be discussed in detail in an independent
Discussion section separated from the results. Furthermore, (3) the relevance of the main finding
of the present model (“coevolutionary cycles between farmers and mafia can still induce host
acceptance of brood parasites”) need a detailed discussion since the biological point of view,
given that, as far as I know, there is no evidence of such coevolutionary cycles and nobody has
even suggested the existence of them.
Minor points:
- Surprisingly, Soler et al. 1995 (Evolution 49, 770-775), the first experimental test of the
mafia hypothesis, is not cited in this paper. The name of “Mafia” was used for the first time in
this paper.
- Lines 29-31 on coevolutionary cycles need some references supporting the meaning. Also
in the Discussion section, references on coevolutionary cycles are lacking. Good papers to be read
and cited on this subject are: Soler et al. 1998 (Oecologia 117: 381-390), Rothstein 2001 (Anim.
Behav. 61:95-107) and, mainly, Soler 2014 (Biol. Rev. 89: 688–704), a review in which evolutionary
cycles are treated in deep.

Decision letter (RSOS-160036)
12-Feb-2016
Dear Dr Abou Chakra,
The editors assigned to your paper ("Coevolutionary Cycles Between Farmers and Mafia Induce
Host Acceptance of Avian Brood Parasites") has now received comments from reviewers. We
would like you to revise your paper in accordance with the referee and Subject Editor
suggestions which can be found below (not including confidential reports to the Editor). Please
note this decision does not guarantee eventual acceptance.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper within three weeks (i.e. by the 06-Mar-2016). If we do
not hear from you within this time then it will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In
exceptional circumstances, extensions may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in
advance.We do not allow multiple rounds of revision so we urge you to make every effort to
fully address all of the comments at this stage. If deemed necessary by the Editors, your
manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the original reviewers for assessment. If the
original reviewers are not available we may invite new reviewers.

Comments to the Author:
I appreciate that the brevity of this article is due to the fact that it was originally submitted to
Biology Letters, which has both a strict word count and a limit on the number of figures. As Open
Science has no such restriction, I encourage the authors to expand their introduction and
discussion along the lines recommended by the referees.

the results obtained by Hauber (2014) who also modeled the effect of both

We have now included more detail about the previous model, especially by
Hauber. Specifically, we discuss the conclusions and the assumptions made
by the model.
(2) The relevance of the results obtained in the present model should be
discussed in detail in an independent Discussion section separated from the
model (“coevolutionary cycles between farmers and mafia can still induce host
acceptance of brood parasites”) need a detailed discussion since the
biological point of view, given that, as far as I know, there is no evidence of

Minor points:
- Surprisingly, Soler et al. 1995 (Evolution 49, 770-775), the first
experimental test of the mafia hypothesis, is not cited in this paper.
The name of “Mafia” was used for the first time in this paper.

This was a mistake we have now corrected this
- Lines 29-31 on coevolutionary cycles need some references

on coevolutionary cycles are lacking. Good papers to be read and

(Biol. Rev. 89: 688–704), a review in which evolutionary cycles are
treated in deep.

Thank you we now analyze and discuss cycles further with a new figure and
link to experiments. We include these additional references
