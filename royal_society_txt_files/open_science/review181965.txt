This manuscript presents the results of an experimental study on two prefabricated lightweight
composite wall structures under cyclic lateral loading. The composite wall structures are a new
type of prefabricated wall structures proposed by the authors. The test results are interesting, and
topic of the study is of importance and value to the practice. I suggest acceptance after some
further revision of the manuscript. Specifically, I have following comments:
1. A literature review on similar composite wall structures should be given. The advantages and
rationale of the proposed composite wall structures should also be elaborated.
2. 1.2 Material Properties: more details on the recycled concrete aggregates (e.g., how and where
were they obtained? How was the compressive strength of the recycled aggregates obtained?)
should be provided.
3. Figure 3: Why was the size of the column significantly smaller than the thickness of the wall
panel? This will cause out-of-plane instability of the structure under lateral loading.
4. 2 Experiment phenomena and failure mechanisms: the authors did not show too much
information on the failure of the beam-column joints or the stiffened ribs, especially for the
composite wall structures.

Title:Experimental study on seismic performance of prefabricated lightweight steel frame-low
energy consumption composite wall structure
General comments: This paper presents a prefabricated lightweight steel frame-low energy
consumption composite wall structure. The low reversed cyclic loading test was carried out on
four full-scale specimens and evaluated their anti-seismic performance.
The failure modes, hysteretic curves, strength, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity of
specimens were analyzed in detail. And the seismic performance of the structures was verified.
The research conclusions can provide some technical reference for the engineering application of
concrete sandwiched double steel tubes. For the engineers, this study has certain positive
significance. In addition, the manuscript lacks the theoretical analysis, such as the calculation
method of seismic bearing capacity of walls, etc. The manuscript can be published in the journal
after the careful revision.
Besides, other evaluations and questions about this manuscript are as follow:
1) The abstract of the paper needs to be further condensed and it is necessary to describe the main
index of seismic performance of the structures. In addition, there are some grammatical
problems, please revise the abstract.
2) In introduction of the manuscript, the descriptive analysis on lack of the advantages of the
structure proposed in the manuscript. The comparative analysis with the existing structures also
needs to be strengthened appropriately. The content should be supplemented in the paper.
3) For ease of understanding, the graphics of the loading system need to be added.
How to determine the axial compression and whether it is reasonable?
4) For ease of understanding, the graphics of the loading system need to be added.
How to determine the axial compression and whether it is reasonable?
5) Whether the connection between steel beams and columns is rigid or semi-rigid and explain
their advantages and disadvantages. How to consider the setting of doors and windows in this
kind of wallboard ?
6) The photographs of recycled coarse aggregate and recycled concrete materials in the test need
to be provided.
7) The numbers of specimens in this paper were limited and it needs to be supplemented by FEM
simulation in the revised manuscript, to enhance the theoretical analysis.
8) How to ensure that the wall structure will not undergo torsion or out-of-plane deformation?
The authors are invited to supply the clarification.
9) The photos show that the wall damage is not serious, but the steel frame deformation is
serious. How to explain? Does it meet the seismic requirements? The authors are invited to
supply the clarification.
10) The shape of hysteretic curve of structure is not full, so it is difficult to show that the structure
has good seismic performance. How to explain this question? The authors are invited to supply
the clarification.
11) How to determine the yield displacement angle of the structure? The authors are invited to
supply the clarification.
12) The author needs to list the main stiffness and energy dissipation indices in tabular form.
13) The conclusions of the paper should be combined with test-related data and some
quantitative analysis conclusions need to give in this paper, which would be more convincing.
The conclusions need to be streamlined and condensed again.
14) The text displays some mistakes in grammar, so the language expression of this manuscript
must be reviewed and modified for improving the standard of English.

Appendix A
Response to Referees
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
1. A literature review on similar composite wall structures
should be given. The advantages and rationale of the proposed
composite wall structures should also be elaborated.
Answer:
Considering the durability, heat preservation, fire resistance, and
impact resistance of the wall, the sandwich composite wall is used in the
cross-sectional construction of this wall. The main types and
characteristics are described next.
The first type of composite wall is the mortar sandwich layer, which is
a polystyrene granular mortar layer, while the two side layers are ordinary
mortar surfaces with steel wires. The surface thicknesses are
approximately equal to 20 mm, and the strength of the surface layer can
attain values > 5 MPa. These characteristics meet the requirements of the
impact resistance of the surface layer. Based on the condition of equal
thickness, the weight of the wall is lighter, but the insulation effect in the
sandwich layer of the polystyrene granular mortar is not as good as that of
the polystyrene board.
The second type relates to the fact that the composite wall is formed
by a polystyrene board sandwich layer together with fine stone concrete
surfaces and steel wire meshes on both sides. Accordingly, the thickness
of the surface layer is approximately 50 mm, and the strength of the surface
layer can attain values > 20 MPa, which can meet the requirements of the
impact resistance of the surface layer. However, the weight of the wall is
heavier than that of the first type if the condition of equal thickness is
assumed to be valid.
The third type refers to the composite wall developed in this study,
whereby the middle layer is an insulation layer of graphite polystyrene
board, and the two side layers are high-performance foam concrete
structural layers with steel wire meshes. The surface thickness is in the
range of 50–80 mm, and the surface strength can attain values > 5 MPa.
Accordingly, these characteristics meet the impact resistance
requirements of the surface layer. Additionally, the weight of the wall is
equivalent to that of the first type if the condition of equal thickness,
insulation effect, and fire resistance of the wall, are better than those of the
former types.
2. 1.2 Material Properties: more details on the recycled
concrete aggregates (e.g., how and where were they obtained? How
was the compressive strength of the recycled aggregates
obtained?) should be provided.
Answer:
Recycled coarse aggregate was processed and produced by the
Shougang Resources Science and Technology Development Company
in Beijing (Figure 6).
Figure 6 Recycled coarse aggregate (5–10 mm)
According to the requirements of ‘Steel and steel products–location
and preparation of samples and test pieces for mechanical testing
(GB/T2975–1998)’, samples were obtained from the corresponding
locations of the test members. Three standard tensile specimens were
conducted for each steel type according to the requirements of ‘Metallic
materials–tensile testing–Part 1: Method of test at room temperature
(GB/T228.1–2010)’.
The 150×150×150 mm cube test block and 150×150×300 mm prism
test block were set aside with the same batch of concrete during pouring
and were maintained using the same conditions as those used for the
specimen. According to the requirements of the ‘Standard for test methods
for mechanical properties on ordinary concrete (GB/T50081–2002)’, the
concrete had a measured cubic compressive strength of 54.0 MPa, an
axial compressive strength of 35.5 MPa, and an elastic modulus of
3.02×104 MPa.
The sites where the material property tests were conducted are
shown in Figure 7.
(a) Material property test for (b) Material property test for
steel concrete
Figure 7 Material property tests
3. Figure 3: Why was the size of the column significantly
smaller than the thickness of the wall panel? This will cause
out-of-plane instability of the structure under lateral loading.
Answer:
The section size of the column was 150 mm × 150 mm, and the
thickness of the panel was 240 mm. The thickness of the panel that
protruded the column is chosen to be equal to 90 mm to attach the surface
of the insulation layer to the column. Owing to the welding measures
between the built-in tension reinforcement in the panel and the column, the
out-of-plane instability of the structure under the transverse load was
effectively prevented.
4. 2 Experiment phenomena and failure mechanisms: the
authors did not show too much information on the failure of the
beam-column joints or the stiffened ribs, especially for the
composite wall structures.
Answer:
The double L-shaped joint with the stiffener rib of all specimens
exhibited no major deformation throughout the test (Figure 14). Upon the
failure of the specimens, the beams and columns of the joint remained
perpendicular despite the reinforced state of the joint. This would lead to
an increased stiffness, which could be explained by the addition of
stiffening ribs to the L-shaped joint. The design improved the strength and
the stiffness of the joint areas, as the composite structure complied with
the model of weak members and strong joints.

Besides, other evaluations and questions about this
manuscript are as follow:
1) The abstract of the paper needs to be further condensed and
it is necessary to describe the main index of seismic
performance of the structures. In addition, there are some
grammatical problems, please revise the abstract.
Answer:
This study developed a low-energy consumption composite wall
structure constructed with a pre-fabricated lightweight steel frame that is
suitable for houses in villages and towns and evaluated its anti-seismic
performance. A low-reversed cyclic-loading test was conducted on four
full-scale pre-fabricated structure specimens, including a lightweight,
concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) column frame specimen (abbreviated as
SFCF), a lightweight CFST column frame composite wall specimen
(abbreviated as SFCFW), an H-steel column frame specimen (abbreviated
as HSCF), and an H-steel column frame composite wall specimen
(abbreviated as HSCFW). The failure characteristics, hysteretic behaviour,
strength, rigidity, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity of each
specimen, were compared and analysed. The results demonstrated that
the pre-fabricated, double L-shaped beam–column joint with a stiffener rib
which was proposed in this study worked reliably and exhibited good anti-
seismic performance. The yield, ultimate, and frame yield loads of the
specimen SFCFW were 1.72, 1.80, and 2.03 times higher than those of
specimen SFCF. The yield load, ultimate load, and frame yield loads of
specimen HSCFW were 1.27, 1.68, and 1.82 times higher than those of
specimen HSCF. This indicates that the embedded composite wall
contributed significantly to the horizontal bearing capacities of the SFCF
and HSCF specimens. The embedded composite wall was divided into
multiple strip-shaped composite panels during failure and achieved a
stable support for the frame in the later stages of elastoplastic deformation.
The horizontal strips of the tongue and groove connection between the
strip-shaped composite panels produced reciprocating bite displacements,
and ultimately improved the structure’s energy dissipation capacity
significantly.
2) In introduction of the manuscript, the descriptive analysis
on lack of the advantages of the structure proposed in the
manuscript. The comparative analysis with the existing
structures also needs to be strengthened appropriately. The
content should be supplemented in the paper.
Answer:
Considering the durability, heat preservation, fire resistance, and impact
resistance of the wall, the sandwich composite wall is used in the cross-
sectional construction of this wall. The main types and characteristics are
described next.
The first type of composite wall is the mortar sandwich layer, which is a

approximately equal to 20 mm, and the strength of the surface layer can
attain values > 5 MPa. These characteristics meet the requirements of the
impact resistance of the surface layer. Based on the condition of equal

sandwich layer of the polystyrene granular mortar is not as good as that of
the polystyrene board.
The second type relates to the fact that the composite wall is formed by a

surfaces and steel wire meshes on both sides. Accordingly, the thickness
of the surface layer is approximately 50 mm, and the strength of the surface
layer can attain values > 20 MPa, which can meet the requirements of the
impact resistance of the surface layer. However, the weight of the wall is
heavier than that of the first type if the condition of equal thickness is
assumed to be valid.
The third type refers to the composite wall developed in this study, whereby
the middle layer is an insulation layer of graphite polystyrene board, and
the two side layers are high-performance foam concrete structural layers
with steel wire meshes. The surface thickness is in the range of 50–80 mm,
and the surface strength can attain values > 5 MPa. Accordingly, these
characteristics meet the impact resistance requirements of the surface
layer. Additionally, the weight of the wall is equivalent to that of the first
type if the condition of equal thickness, insulation effect, and fire resistance
of the wall, are better than those of the former types.

4) For ease of understanding, the graphics of the loading system

Answer:
Same as question 3
5) Whether the connection between steel beams and columns is
rigid or semi-rigid and explain their advantages and
disadvantages. How to consider the setting of doors and windows
in this kind of wallboard ?
Answer:
The moment of inertia in the joint domain of the reinforced joint is
significantly larger than that of the beam and column sections. Additionally,
the joint is rigid, which improves the anti-lateral stiffness of the frame
structure and avoids structural failures caused by the failure of the frame
joint during strong earthquakes. The height of the inclined stiffener in the
design should not exceed the height of the floor. Therefore, when the frame
and floor were assembled together, the surface of the floor did not reveal
an oblique stiffening rib. Thus, the height of the oblique stiffener rib was
limited. Accordingly, the stiffener rib is only used in low-rise residence
buildings at present.
When the frame and floor were assembled together, the oblique
stiffener did not expose the floor surface. Therefore, the wall’s filling pattern
type (with the use of holes or otherwise) is irrelevant to the structure and
function of the joints.
6) The photographs of recycled coarse aggregate and recycled
concrete materials in the test need to be provided.
Answer:
Recycled coarse aggregate was processed and produced by the
Shougang Resources Science and Technology Development Company
in Beijing (Figure 6).
Figure 6 Recycled coarse aggregate (5–10 mm)
According to the requirements of ‘Steel and steel products–location
and preparation of samples and test pieces for mechanical testing

locations of the test members. Three standard tensile specimens were
conducted for each steel type according to the requirements of ‘Metallic

The 150×150×150 mm cube test block and 150×150×300 mm prism
test block were set aside with the same batch of concrete during pouring
and were maintained using the same conditions as those used for the
specimen. According to the requirements of the ‘Standard for test methods
for mechanical properties on ordinary concrete (GB/T50081–2002)’, the
concrete had a measured cubic compressive strength of 54.0 MPa, an
axial compressive strength of 35.5 MPa, and an elastic modulus of
3.02×104 MPa.
The sites where the material property tests were conducted are
shown in Figure 7.

7) The numbers of specimens in this paper were limited and it
needs to be supplemented by FEM simulation in the revised
manuscript, to enhance the theoretical analysis.
Answer:
It is difficult to simulate the cross-section between the tongue–groove
connection. Accordingly, if the embedded composite wall is equivalent to
the integral composite wall, it will not be consistent with the real composite
panel technology. It is noted that the simulation error is large. The author
intends to carry out more low-cycle reversed and shaking table tests on
the structural system with optimised parameters, followed by the conduct
of more accurate finite element simulations.
8) How to ensure that the wall structure will not undergo torsion
or out-of-plane deformation? The authors are invited to supply
the clarification.
Answer:
To ensure that the wall structure did not undergo torsion or
deformation outside the plane, a lateral limit device was used, which was
composed of a limited steel beam which was fixed on both sides of the
specimen, and a horizontal short beam which was fixed vertically on the
limit steel beam end. Accordingly, the horizontal short beam was in contact
with the plane of the loading column end, and could thus a) limit the
external displacement of the specimen and b) slip along the loading
direction. This effectively prevented the torsional deformation outside the
plane of the specimen’s structure.
9) The photos show that the wall damage is not serious, but the
steel frame deformation is serious. How to explain? Does it meet
the seismic requirements? The authors are invited to supply the
clarification.
Answer:
In this study, the seismic performance of a lightweight CFST column
frame-composite wall structure and the H-steel column frame-composite
wall structure were compared. In the Figure 13, the steel frame column
with considerable deformation outside the plane was the H-shaped steel
frame column, the external deformation of the light CFST column was very
small, and the performance was well (Figure 12). Because the composite
wall adopted the easy construction of strip-shaped composite panels, the
top convex groove of the bottom strip-shaped composite panel was
inserted into the bottom concave groove of the panel above. The seam
was caulked with foam concrete paste, the structure displacement angle
was large when the seam between the strip panels staggered and
consumed the seismic energy. This increased the overall deformation
ability of the wall, and the self-destruction of the strip-shaped composite
panel thus became lighter.
10) The shape of hysteretic curve of structure is not full, so it
is difficult to show that the structure has good seismic
performance. How to explain this question? The authors are
invited to supply the clarification.
Answer:
The authors have carried out a shaking table test on a full-scale and
two-story light CFST column frame composite wall structure, with a
building height of 5400 mm, and plane size dimensions of 4400 mm × 4400
mm. The experimental results showed that the structure was subjected to
an earthquake of 8 degree. The inter-story displacement angle was
approximately equal to 1/500, and there was no obvious damage to the
structure. This showed that the structure had a good seismic performance.
Accordingly, the structure exhibited functional recoverability at large
earthquake intensities. Although the shape of the hysteretic curve was not
full, the functionality can be recovered after the earthquake.
11) How to determine the yield displacement angle of the
structure? The authors are invited to supply the clarification.
Answer:
The yield, ultimate, and failure feature points of the specimen were
calculated with the use of the universal yield bending moment method [30].
The method used to determine the feature points of the skeleton curve is
shown in Figure 17.

12) The author needs to list the main stiffness and energy
dissipation indices in tabular form.
Answer:
The he , <U+0001D438>max , and their relative values when the specimens reach
the ultimate load point are shown in Table 7.

Table 7 indicates that the E value of specimen SFCFW was
significantly larger than that of SFCF, and the E value of specimen HSCFW
was significantly larger than that of HSCF. This is because there were
displacements between the strip-shaped composite panels. The friction
energy consumption increased the total structural energy consumption. At
the same time, the embedded composite wall acted synergistically with the
frame and increased the energy dissipation capacity of the structure.
When the structure reached the ultimate load, the displacement angle
of the specimen HSCF reaches a value of 3.5% as mentioned above, even
though the values of he and Emax of the HSCF were respectively 1.46 times
and 1.89 times higher than those of SFCF. Accordingly, the energy
dissipation capacity of the specimen could not be utilised at this time.
13) The conclusions of the paper should be combined with test-
related data and some quantitative analysis conclusions need to
give in this paper, which would be more convincing. The
conclusions need to be streamlined and condensed again.
Answer:
(1) The developed low-energy consumption composite wall structure
with the pre-fabricated lightweight steel frame exhibited good anti-seismic
performance. The proposed pre-fabricated double L-shaped joint with the
stiffener rib beam-column joint worked reliably and was easy to assemble.
This led to the realisation of a ductile yield mechanism in the lightweight
steel frame with a strong column, weak beam, and a stronger joint
(2) The developed pre-fabricated lightweight CFST column frame
showed better anti-seismic performance compared to the H-steel column
frame. Specifically, in the later stage of the elastoplastic deformation
process, the rapid degradation of anti-seismic performance caused by the
instability of light steel components was prevented
(3) Compared to the bare lightweight CFST column frame, the yield
bearing capacity of the low-energy consumption composite wall structure
of the lightweight CFST column frame improved by 72%, the ultimate
bearing capacity increased by 80%, and the initial rigidity increased by
369%. Compared to the bare H-steel column frame, the yield bearing
capacity of the low-energy consumption composite wall structure of the H-
steel column frame improved by 27%, the ultimate bearing capacity
increased by 68%, and the initial rigidity increased by 394%. The
reciprocating bite displacement of the horizontal strips of pre-fabricated
strip-shaped composite panels of the tongue and groove connection
contributed significantly to the improvement of the structural energy
dissipation capacity
14) The text displays some mistakes in grammar, so the language
expression of this manuscript must be reviewed and modified for
improving the standard of English.
Answer:
This manuscript has been reviewed and modified for improving the
standard of English.
Additionally, in engineering practice, wall opening is a common
phenomenon of structure, but the study of the frame with the opening
wall is not mature enough. The authors plan to conduct in the future a
series of opening wall tests. Based on the collected test data, the
mechanical performance of the lightweight composite wall with the door
and window holes under the steel frame will be analysed and the results
will be published.
