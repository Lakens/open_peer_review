This is an interesting paper that examines the role played by environmental conditions on sea
turtle egg mortality both in the short-terms - annually - and the long term - trends over 20 years.
The data are interesting and worth publishing but I have concerns about the presentation of key
elements in this version. More details are below...
l. 81-91 - There is often an assumption that TSD is a black & white effect - the reality is that
individual embryos will vary in their pivotal temperature and at this PVT both males and females
are produced that are pre-adapted to the prevailing conditions. The authors should be a little
more circumspect about change sin temperature are automatically going to be "bad" for a
population.
l. 108-110 - needs citation
l. 156-157 - How can eggs that contain no visible sign of an embryo be described as exhibiting
embryonic mortality. There may be very early mortality but equally the egg may have been
infertile - there is not way of telling. Stage zero should be changed throughout the text to indicate
egg mortality not embryo mortality.
l. 161 - ~60+ is too imprecise for the calculations. Presumably %age were calculated on IP = 60
days so the authors should be clearer about this.
l. 162 onwards - Hatched turtles that do not emerge from the nest cannot be considered as
embryonic mortality. The reasons for their deaths may be very different. The authors should
separate out these values and analyse them separately; ideally with weather conditions during
the brief hatching period being considered separately too. This would lead to a better
understanding of how rainfall or temperature impact on pre-emergent hatchling survival.
l. 178 onwards - rain can arrive in a heavy storm or steadily over a period of days. The same
amount of water may fall but in a storm air gaps in nesting substrates will get saturated quickly
but over prolonger light rain they may remain free of water. This is an important consideration
that the authors need to address in their thinking about their data.
l. 192-193 - Rain will impact on embryos in a variety of ways - during late development saturation
of nesting substrates reduces available oxygen leading to rapid hypoxia. This will potentially kill
late term embryos, which have the highest oxygen demands. The role that oxygen availability
will play in nests is barely touched upon so needs greater consideration in this manuscript.
l. 206 - missing data - for what? indicate what data are missing.
L. 230 - A section describing the actual climatic conditions - means and ranges would be really
helpful at the start of this results section.
l. 233-234 indicate times scale.
l. 238 stage zero cannot be confirmed as embryos (see above) so this needs revision
l. 257-260 / l. 271-273 / l. 283-284 - An indication of the actual ranges of values experienced here
will help in understanding the impacts
l. 292-293 - presumably these are mean values - error bars should be indicated in graphs to show
the variation in these means between years.
3
l. 294-295 - what about effects on patterns of egg loss and late-stage mortality?
l. 301-302 - "stable" - the temperature fluctuated a lot so what do the authors actually mean here?
l. 310 - the actual mean temps are 5-8 C lower than these temperatures. No indication of
temperature ranges experienced are problematic in interpreting actual temperature experienced
by eggs in this study.
l.329-341 - What is point of this paragraph? the mean temp is at the pivotal temperature so why
the emphasis on what might happen?
l. 370-372 - hypoxia is more likely to kill late-term embryos because of their high O2 demands
than early embryos. As indicated above the importance of oxygen in underground nests
impacted by waterlogging has been understated here - this should be resolved.
Figures 2 & 3 - the data presented are bit counter-intuitive - the authors need to make it clearer
the direction by which factor such as precipitation and temperature are impacting on the
variables.
Figures 4 & 5 could be combined if colour was used. Grey lines never reproduce well. Same
applied to Figures 6 & 7.
Undeveloped eggs could reflect a change over time for fertility so stages zero and three should be
illustrated over time to show any patterns.

4
5
6
26
7
8 27 Unprecedented increases in air temperature and erratic precipitation patterns are predicted
9
10 28 throughout the 21st century as a result of climate change. A recent global analysis of
11
12 29 leatherback turtle hatchling output predicts that the nesting site at Sandy Point National
13
14 30 Wildlife Refuge (SPNWR) will endure the most unfavourable regional climate alterations.
15
16
17 31 We aimed to identify how local air temperatures and precipitation patterns influenced within
18
19 32 nest mortality and overall hatchling output at this site between 1990 – 2010. Results showed
20
21 33 that the rate of embryo mortality was highest during the initial stages of development (~3.8
22
23 34 embryos/day/clutch) and precipitation was the most influential climate variable associated
24
25
26
35 with this mortality. There was a significant decline in overall hatching success (P < 0.01, tau
27
28 36 = -0.45) and emergence rate (P < 0.01, tau = -0.47), both falling from 74% to 55% and from
29
30 37 96% to 91%, respectively. However, there was no trend in local temperature or precipitation,
31
32 38 and neither variable was related to hatching success or emergence rate. In conclusion, our
33
34
39 findings suggest that despite influencing within nest mortality, climatic variability does not
35
36
37 40 account for the overall decline in hatchling output at SPNWR. Further research is therefore
38
39 41 needed to elicit the reasons for this decline.

4
5
6
51
7
8 52 Projections in the fifth assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
9
10 53 (IPCC) predict an ongoing increase in global air temperature, more erratic precipitation
11
12 54 patterns, continued sea level rise and ocean acidification 1. Collectively, changes to both
13
14 55 terrestrial and marine environments have the potential to significantly impact marine turtle
15
16 2, 3
17 56 populations because they occupy both habitats during ontogeny . Research into such
18
19 57 impacts on leatherback turtle populations has intensified during the last decade following
20
21 58 identification of the precipitous and critical decline of this species in the Pacific Ocean 4. In
22
23 59 an attempt to understand the possible causes for such drastic declines in this region, studies
24
25
26
60 began focusing on the effects of climate variability on juvenile and adult turtles in the open
27
28 61 ocean 5, 6, and on developmental success of embryos on the nesting beach 7.
29
30 62
31
32 63 Research to date shows that decreased oceanic productivity in foraging and migration areas,
33
34
64 caused by climatic variability, alters remigration intervals and negatively affects egg
35
36 5, 6, 8
37 65 production in leatherback turtles . Additionally, increased air temperature and decreased
38
39 66 precipitation on nesting beaches is detrimental because it reduces hatching and emergence
40
41 67 success 9, 10. The latest IPCC report details the successive decadal increase in air temperature
42
43 68 over the last three decades, which is greater than any foregoing decadal increase since 1850
44
45
46
69 (IPCC 2013). Rising temperatures and continued beach warming are predicted to reduce the
47
48 70 Costa Rican leatherback population by ~7% per decade during the twenty-first century 10.

52 72 Temperature and precipitation patterns influence the timing of the sea turtle nesting season 11
53
54
73 and alter the thermal and hydric nest environment, which largely directs embryonic
55
56
57 74 development and determines hatchling sex during incubation 12-14. Throughout incubation, the

2
3 75 developing embryo exchanges heat, carbon dioxide, oxygen and water with its surrounding
4
5 15, 16
76 environment via a permeable eggshell . Nest environmental variables are closely
6
7 77 interlinked and an extreme in any one of them can have detrimental effects on development,
8
9
10 78 which is of primary concern given rising global temperatures and changing precipitation
11
12 79 patterns.
13
14 80
15
16 81 The thermal environment of the nest dictates the rate of embryonic development and
17
18 15
19 82 successful growth only occurs within a tolerance range between 25-35°C . Temperatures
20
21 83 outside this range cause embryo mortality, which has also been documented in pre-emergent
22
23 84 marine turtle hatchlings when nest sand temperatures exceed 33°C 17. Furthermore, hatchling
24
25
85 sex is also dictated by incubation temperature (temperature dependent sex determination;
26
27
28 86 TSD), giving rise to sex bias and the generation of more females at higher temperatures. The
29
30 87 pivotal temperature at which marine turtle sex is determined is generally ~29°C and appears
31
32 18
88 to be conserved at both a species and population level . The threat imposed by high nest
33
34
89 temperatures is somewhat offset by precipitation, which in moderation, decreases temperature
35
36
37 90 within the nest 12, 19, 20. However, excessive precipitation can decrease gas exchange, causing
38
39 91 egg and hatchling mortality 21, 22.
40
41 92
42
43 93 Despite the profound impact that altered incubation conditions have on embryo development,
44
45
46 94 limited research exists that looks at the bearing that climate variability can have on offspring
47 23, 24
48 95 production . This is particularly pertinent in the case of the leatherback turtle, which is
49
50 96 anomalous among the seven species of marine turtle for having an extremely low average
51
52 97 hatching success of ~50% 25, 26. A high rate of early embryo mortality following oviposition is
53
54 25
98 the primary determinant of this low hatching success, rather than infertility . Differing
55
56
57 99 reproductive success among females has been linked to early embryonic mortality, but much

6
7 102
8
9
10 103 The impact of climate variability on hatchling production can only be fully understood from
11 28
12 104 assessing long-term trends in data . Marine turtles live and nest for many years, and
13
14 105 evaluating reproductive output in a given year does not accurately reflect a lifetime of
15
16 106 reproductive investment. On a year to year basis, factors dictating the nest environment (e.g.
17
18
107 nest position and time of nesting) are very important, but on a larger time scale, inter-annual
19
20
21 108 variation may prove to be a greater determinant of overall success. Furthermore, the
22
23 109 potentially feminising effects that increased temperature may have on both a rookery and
24
25 110 population level can only be determined from examining sex ratios over time, because ratios
26
27 111 may vary among years and nesting beaches within a population. Failure to gain an in-depth
28
29
30 112 knowledge of climate change impacts on a population level is currently constraining effective
31
32 113 management 29.
33
34 114
35
36 115 A recent global analysis of leatherback turtle hatchling output predicted that the nesting site at

38
116 Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge (SPNWR) on St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, will endure
39
40 30
41 117 the most unfavourable future regional climate alterations . We aimed to identify how
42
43 118 historical fluctuations in local ambient air temperatures and precipitation patterns influenced
44
45 119 within nest mortality and overall hatchling output at this site. To ensure a long-term, robust
46
47 120 dataset we used twenty years of nesting and environmental data (1990 – 2010), collected at
48
49
50 121 Sandy Point nesting beach, which is the site of the world’s longest running saturation-tagging

9

11
12 129 Data for this study were collected at SPNWR (17o41 N, 64o54 W), during the leatherback
13
14 130 turtle nesting season (April – August) each year between 1990 and 2010. Nesting on SPNWR
15
16
17 131 occurs within a 3.0 km range spanning both a north-facing open shore and a south-east facing
18
19 132 heavily vegetated shore prone to large amounts of deposition 31. An estimated abundance of
20
21 133 ~695 nests per annum are being laid at SPNWR, with a generally increasing trend in the
22
23 134 nesting population 32. Data collection methods at this site have previously been described 33.
24
25
26
135 Nightly beach patrols were conducted during the monitoring period on an hourly basis
27 34
28 136 between 20:00 to 05:00h to locate and identify female turtles during nesting. Remigrant
29
30 137 females (having nested at least once in a previous season) were identified by flipper and/or
31
32 138 passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags previously applied. Females without tags were
33
34
139 recorded and tagged for identification in subsequent years. Successful nesting events were
35
36
37 140 recorded and in some instances, nests laid in an erosion-prone location or below the high-tide
38
39 141 mark were relocated to a hatchery or stable area of the beach. Nest location (in-situ and
40
41 142 relocated) was triangulated for later identification and excavation following hatchling

7 152 developmental stage at death was determined based on the presence/absence of anatomical
8
9
10 153 features. For this study, embryos were assigned to one of four “field stages” (ranked zero-
11 35 36
12 154 three) based on the method described by Leslie et al. , which corresponds to Miller’s
13
16, 27
14 155 developmental chronology for sea turtles, and is consistent with previous research e.g. .
15
16 156 Field stage zero included eggs up to approximately 4 days post-oviposition in which no
17
18
157 embryo or blood vessels were visible; field stage one included eggs estimated to be between 4
19
20
21 158 – 9 days post-oviposition, in which visible blood vessels and an unpigmented embryo were
22
23 159 present; field stage two included eggs estimated to be between 9 – 24 days post-oviposition
24
25 160 containing embryos with pigmented eyes; and field stage three included eggs with fully
26
27 161 pigmented embryos estimated to be between 24 days and full term (~60+ days). Dead
28
29
30 162 hatchlings that failed to emerge from the nest were also included in this latter field stage.
31
32 163 Furthermore, no eggs were assigned to an “unknown” category during this investigation
33
34 164 because by definition, eggs with no evidence of blood vessel or embryo development were
35
36 165 categorised as field stage zero. Embryonic mortality at each field stage was calculated for
37
38
166 each clutch as a percentage of the total number of eggs that died in that clutch. Similarly, the
39
40
41 167 mean number of embryos dying per day of incubation during each developmental stage was
42
43 168 computed because stages are of differing duration.

3 175 precipitation (mm) was calculated for the 30 days immediately preceding the laying date of
4
5 176 each nest (representing sand moisture at the time of laying). Additionally, accumulated
6
7 177 precipitation and mean temperature (°C) was also determined for the entire incubation period
8
9
10 178 of each nest. The incubation period was defined as the number of days from egg laying to first
11
12 179 hatchling emergence. Accumulated precipitation and mean temperature were also calculated
13
14 180 from the time of egg laying to the completion of each successive field stage (stages zero –
15
16 181 three) in each nest. Estimated time to completion of each developmental stage, expressed as a
17
18
182 percentage of total incubation time, has previously been defined for marine turtle embryos 36.
19
20
21 183 Using this information, it was possible to estimate that from egg laying, it takes
22
23 184 approximately 6.7% of incubation to complete field stage zero, 13.4% of incubation to
24
25 185 complete field stage one, and 39.4% and 100.0% of incubation to complete field stages two
26
27 186 and three respectively. These percentages are cumulative and take into account that to
28
29
30 187 complete field stage two of development, embryos must successfully complete both field
31
32 188 stages one and two, and so on. Applying these percentage values to the known incubation
33
34 189 dates for each nest allowed approximation of the date when each field stage finished and the
35
36 190 subsequent stage commenced. Accumulated precipitation and mean temperature were then
37
38
191 calculated from the time of egg laying to the completion of each successive stage for every
39
40
41 192 nest using these dates.

4
5 201 Accumulated precipitation one month before egg-laying, and accumulated precipitation and

7 202 mean temperature during incubation were treated as fixed predictor variables. Following
8
9
10 203 preliminary investigations, stages one and two were omitted from subsequent analyses
11
12 204 because mean combined mortality was negligible (~5 %; Figure 1) and the models including
13
14 205 these variables had poor explanatory power. All models were checked for assumptions
15
16 206 (normality and equal variances of residuals). Furthermore, missing data meant that years 1991
17
18
207 and 2001 were excluded. Both in-situ and relocated nests were included in the analyses.

21 208
22

31
32 213 and models were ranked based on <U+2206>i values. AIC difference (<U+2206>i) represents the difference in
33
34 214 AICc values between a particular model of interest and the 'best' (most parsimonious)
35
36 215 explanatory model. Models with <U+2206>i values = 2 are considered to have stronger support than
37
38
216 those with values = 2 37, with the 'best' model having the lowest <U+2206>i value.

50 221 with and without each variable. The percentage total independent contribution of each

22
23 233 A total of 4,614 clutches comprising of 357,262 eggs were included in the analyses. There
24
25
26
234 was a significant decline in hatching success (T = 47, P < 0.01, tau = -0.45) and emergence
27
28 235 rate (T = 45, P < 0.01, tau = -0.47), both falling from 74% to 55% and from 96% to 91%,
29
30 236 respectively. The largest percentage of embryonic death occurred during field stage three
31
32 237 (89,038 embryos; 50.62 ± 29.99%), with a mean of ~0.50 embryos dying per day per clutch
33
34
238 (Figure 1). Many embryos also died during field stage zero (71,898 embryos; 44.02 ±
35
36
37 239 28.42%), although in contrast to field stage three, the mean rate of embryo mortality per day
38
39 240 was higher, at ~3.8 embryos per day per clutch (Figure 1). Embryonic death during field
40
41 241 stages one and two were lower than field stages zero and three with 1,260 embryos (0.86 ±
42
43 242 3.40%) and 6,850 embryos (4.21 ± 6.30%) dying at each stage, respectively. The mean rates
44
45
46
243 of embryo mortality at stages one and two were also a lower ~0.07 dying per day per clutch
47
48 244 and ~0.09 dying per day per clutch, respectively (Figure 1).

8
9
10 252 for hatching success and three models for emergence rate (Table 1). The global model
11
12 253 including all three predictor variables (precipitation before laying, precipitation during
13
14 254 incubation, and temperature during incubation) accounted for 50% of the variation in hatching
15
16 255 success, indicating that collectively they were all important determinants of hatching success
17
18
256 within a clutch (Table 1). However, further investigation using hierarchical partitioning
19
20
21 257 predominantly supported temperature during incubation as the most important variable to
22
23 258 influence clutch hatching success, with an independent explanatory power of 63% (Figure 2).
24
25 259 An inverse relationship existed between temperature during incubation and hatching success,
26
27 260 which decreased within a clutch when temperature increased.
28
29
30 261
31
32 262 With regard to emergence rate, all three models in the set included precipitation during
33
34 263 incubation. However, the top-ranked model (lowest AIC value) contained only precipitation
35
36 264 during incubation, which explained 39% of the variation in clutch emergence rate (Table 1).
37
38
265 Hierarchical partitioning also supported the selection of precipitation during incubation as the
39
40
41 266 most influential variable (Figure 2). Precipitation during incubation had the highest
42
43 267 independent explanatory power of all three variables, which accounted for 67% of the total
44
45 268 independent contribution of all variables. Both precipitation before laying and temperature
46
47 269 during incubation had smaller, independent contributions of 14% and 19%, respectively. The
48
49
50 270 agreement between both statistical methods that precipitation during incubation is the variable
51 39
52 271 most likely to influence clutch emergence rate significantly strengthens this finding . An
53
54 272 overall positive relationship existed between precipitation during incubation and emergence
55
56 273 success, with emergence success increasing with precipitation.

5 275 Model selection using AICc resulted in two models with substantial support for explaining
6
7 276 each of stage zero and stage three mortality (Table 2). With regard to stage zero, the top-
8
9
10 277 ranked model included two variables (precipitation before laying and precipitation during
11
12 278 developmental stage) and explained 53% of the variation in stage zero mortality. Increased
13
14 279 mortality at stage zero was associated with a decrease in precipitation before laying and an
15
16 280 increase in precipitation while embryos were at stage zero. In contrast, the top-ranked model
17
18
281 for stage three also included precipitation during that developmental stage, as well as
19
20
21 282 temperature during the stage, which explained 53% of the variation in stage three mortality.
22
23 283 Increased mortality at stage three was associated with decreased precipitation and increased
24
25 284 temperature during the developmental stage. Hierarchical partitioning supported the selection
26
27 285 of precipitation during developmental stage as the most important variable influencing both
28
29
30 286 stages zero and three mortality within a clutch, with independent contributions of 52% and

4

6
300
7
8 301 Between 1990 and 2010, the temperature and precipitation that nests experienced during
9
10 302 incubation remained relatively stable at SPNWR. Fluctuations in both climatic variables were
11
12 303 associated with an increase in within nest mortality but they were not related to the overall
13
14 304 decline in hatchling output at this site. Our results contrast findings at other leatherback
15
16
17 305 nesting sites, where climatic variability driven by the El Niño Southern Oscillation creates a
18
19 306 more extreme nesting environment. In northwest Costa Rica, drier and warmer conditions
20
21 307 increase leatherback egg and hatchling mortality 9. Similarly, a decline in hatchling output
22
23 308 due to increased temperatures has also been documented in other marine turtle species 40. In
24
25
26
309 these latter studies, embryo and hatchling mortality occurred when nest temperatures reached
27
28 310 or exceeded a lethal threshold, which is generally considered to be 33°C - 35°C 9. Although
29
30 311 finite lethal temperature ranges for leatherback turtle embryos are lacking in the literature, the
31
32 312 species may be more sensitive to incubation temperature than other species based on a meta-
33
34 40
35 313 analysis of existing temperature and hatching success data . However, there have been
36
37 314 reports of leatherback embryos withstanding short-term exposure to temperatures above 36°C
38
39 315 without any detrimental impact on success 41, 42.
40
41 316
42
43
44 317 Ambient air temperature was used as a proxy for sand temperature during this study and is a
45 28, 43
46 318 widely accepted alternative in the absence of direct sand measurements . However, air
47
48 319 temperature does not account for the increase in temperature associated with metabolic
49
50 320 heating in the nest chamber. Binckley et al (1998) documented an increase in leatherback
51
52
53 321 turtle nest temperatures of up to 7°C due to metabolic heating, which begins as early as the
54
55 322 middle third of incubation. Further, eggs in the centre of a nest experience a greater
56
57 323 temperature change and have a lower developmental success than those at the periphery 16, 42,
58
59
60

2
3 324 although we could not associate egg location with developmental fate in this study. An
4
5 325 increase in the maximum daily nest temperature of this magnitude would likely put the
6
7 326 embryos within the lethal temperature range and therefore help to explain why we observed
8
9
10 327 increased mortality, particularly during late development.
11
12 328
13
14 329 At SPNWR, the overall mean air temperature during incubation from 1990 – 2010 was
15
16 330 28.2°C, which is close to the pivotal temperature for TSD for this species 41. However, if nest
17
18
19 331 temperatures were higher than reported here, it is possible that the production of female
20
21 332 turtles was primarily favoured at SPNWR. Historically, the production of more females at
22
23 333 higher temperatures provided an evolutionary advantage because it offset rising mortality
24
25 334 levels by increasing fecundity 30
. However, at the rate of today’s change TSD is no longer
26
27
28
335 capable of buffering the negative impact that higher temperatures have on population growth.
29
30 336 The reduction or elimination of male turtles in breeding populations as a result of global
31
32 337 warming is of serious concern and an area of emerging interest 3, 44. It is also important to note
33
34 338 that increased incubation temperature can alter hatchling dispersal phenotype, by influencing
35
36 339 swimming and crawling speed, growth and mortality in both marine and freshwater species 24,
37
38 45, 46
39 340 . Therefore, increased incubation temperatures can have lasting effects beyond egg
40
41 341 incubation.
42
43 342
44
45 343 An important finding from this study was the interplay between temperature and precipitation,
46
47
48
344 and how both variables affected each stage of development. To our knowledge this is the first
49
50 345 study to document the impact of both climatic variables on the success of embryos in natural
51
52 346 nests at each developmental stage. Precipitation had the largest individual impact on the
53
54 347 survival of embryos at each stage, but its effects differed markedly during early and late
55
56
348 stages of development. Increased precipitation elevated mortality in early stage embryos,

59

1
2
3 349 whereas it promoted survival of late stage embryos, as well as increased emergence success.
4
5 12
350 Recent work by Wyneken & Lolavar has experimentally demonstrated the importance of
6
7 351 nest moisture as a modifier of the effect of temperature on sex determination, with elevated
8
9
10 352 moisture resulting in male turtles being produced from nests at what would otherwise be
11
12 353 considered female-producing temperatures. The interaction between environmental
13
14 354 temperature and environmental precipitation can therefore have important consequences for
15
16 355 both survival and sex of embryos.
17
18
356
19
20
21 357 Increased precipitation at the end of development may promote survival through several
22
23 358 mechanisms related mainly to temperature regulation. High temperatures negatively impact
24
25 359 survival by decreasing oxygen diffusion in the nest 47, inhibiting muscle coordination during
26
27 360 hatchling ascent, causing sand desiccation thus making it difficult to ascend, and generally
28
29
30 361 increasing mortality of hatchlings prior to emergence 17, 48. Increased precipitation ameliorates
31
32 362 these effects by reducing nest temperature 19, 20, 49.
33
34 363
35
36 364 High early stage mortality as a result of precipitation is more difficult to interpret. First, it is
37
38
365 possible that high precipitation decreases nest temperature below an optimum range for
39
40 20
41 366 successful growth and development . However, stage zero development following
42
50
43 367 oviposition is independent of temperature in green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas and so
44
45 368 possibly in leatherbacks also. Second, parchment-shelled turtle eggs become turgid from
46
47 369 absorbing water vapour in the surrounding nest environment after oviposition, but it is
48
49
50 370 actually subsequent water loss that appears to be more detrimental to development 15. Finally,
51
52 371 decreased diffusion of oxygen throughout the nest as a result of precipitation may negatively
53
54 372 impact development 21. Although oxygen consumption of early embryos is negligible, oxygen
55
56 373 is the trigger necessary to break preovipositional arrest of embryos following oviposition 51, 52.

2
3 374 Although a threshold concentration of oxygen required by embryos to break arrest has not
4
5 375 been established, it is possible that oxygen levels in the nest following precipitation are too
6
7 376 low to facilitate this, resulting in embryo mortality.
8
9
10 377
11
12 378 Interestingly, the patterns of mortality seen at SPNWR are somewhat different to those
13
14 379 reported for other leatherback populations. The embryos of leatherbacks nesting in the Pacific
15
16 380 primarily die during stage zero, presumably because they fail to recommence development at
17
18 25, 27
381 laying following a period of preovipositional arrest in utero . In contrast, in our
19
20
21 382 investigation, stage three mortality accounted for the largest percentage of overall clutch
22
23 383 mortality. However, taking the number of embryos dying per day into account, stage zero
24
25 384 remains the most significant stage in influencing clutch success. Nevertheless, the overall
26
27 385 effects of increasing embryo mortality are likely to impact the stability of the SPNWR
28
29
30 386 population in 10-15 years’ time when hatchlings reach maturity. At such a time, the existing
31 32
32 387 increasing trend in population growth will likley be reversed, particularly if the climate
33
34 388 continues to change.
35
36 389
37
38
390 It is clear that high temperatures and altered precipitation patterns can have a significant effect
39
40
41 391 on embryo development, hatchling survival and hatchling fitness. However, the impact that
42
43 392 both variables can have during marine turtle ontogeny extends beyond the embryonic period.
44
45 393 Marine turtles are primarily aquatic and their distribution patterns in the open ocean are
46
47 394 largely dictated by sea surface temperature 53, 54
. Ocean productivity and food availability is
48
49
50 395 also closely linked to this environmental variable, which may alter food distribution and
51
52 396 availability, and impact remigration intervals 5, 6. Furthermore, predicted increases in sea level
53
54 397 of up to 4.2mm per year may compromise nesting beach availability and stability 2. Evidently,

3 398 climate change can have profound impacts on every aspect of the marine turtle life cycle and
4
5 399 detrimentally affect population dynamics.
6
7 400
8
9
10 401 In conclusion, our findings suggest that despite influencing within nest mortality, climatic
11
12 402 variability does not account for the overall decrease in hatchling output at SPNWR. Further
13
14 403 research is therefore needed to elicit the reasons for this regional decline. Nevertheless, future
15
16 404 projections of increased warming and drying at this nesting site remain troubling because
17
18
405 potential feminisation of this large breeding population is of paramount concern and efforts
19
20

mment: (Lines 81-91) There is often an assumption that TSD is a black & white effect -
reality is that individual embryos will vary in their pivotal temperature and at this PVT
h males and females are produced that are pre-adapted to the prevailing conditions.
e authors should be a little more circumspect that changes in temperature are
omatically going to be "bad" for a population.
sponse: Many thanks for this constructive comment. In the introduction, the text has
w been amended to read, “Furthermore, hatchling sex is also dictated by incubation
perature (temperature dependent sex determination; TSD), which may give rise to sex
s and the generation of more females at higher temperatures”. Additionally, a more in-
pth discussion on TSD and sex-bias has been added to the discussion section, which
ds, “At SPNWR, the overall mean air temperature during incubation from 1990 – 2010
s 28.2<U+F0B0>C, which is close to the pivotal temperature for TSD for this species. At these
her temperatures, it is plausible to hypothesise that primary sex ratios may be heavily
ale biased at SPNWR, as is the case at other nesting sites. Historically, the production
more females at higher temperatures provided an evolutionary advantage because it
et rising mortality levels by increasing fecundity. However, there are concerns that a
tinued reduction in male hatchling output and a subsequent decline or elimination of
eding adult males as a result of climate change may have serious detrimental effects
population stability. However, recent analysis suggests that female-biased hatchling
ratios translate into balanced operational sex ratios, until extreme temperatures result
embryonic mortality. Additionally, a recent investigation of sex ratios in the breeding
ults at SPNWR revealed 1.02 males for every female, implying that the operational sex
o is balanced in this breeding stock. The stability of the temperature at this site over the
t two decades also suggests that this may be the steady state for this population”.
mment: (Lines 108-110) Needs citation
sponse: This has been amended, thank you.
mment: (Lines 156-157) How can eggs that contain no visible sign of an embryo be
cribed as exhibiting embryonic mortality. There may be very early mortality but equally
egg may have been infertile - there is no way of telling. Stage zero should be changed
oughout the text to indicate egg mortality not embryo mortality.
sponse: Unfertilized eggs are sometimes suggested as a reason for no visible
elopment, but we are unaware of any evidence to support this, while empirical studies
e strong data to conclude that absence of a visible embryo is due to early embryonic
ath at a stage non visible to the naked eye. Published research shows that infertility is
unlikely cause of low hatching success in leatherback turtles. In lines 102-103 of the
nuscript we state, “A high rate of early embryo mortality following oviposition is the
mary determinant of this low hatching success, rather than infertility”. This assertion is
ed on research conducted by Bell et al (2004) that observed, “embryonic death,
ticularly in the beginning of incubation before embryos are visible to the unaided eye,
s the cause of low hatching success” in this species. This supported earlier data in
er leatherback populations (Whitmore and Dutton, 1985). Furthermore, is has not been
monstrated that infertility is an issue in other sea turtle populations. We have therefore
the text unchanged.
mment: (Lines 161 +) is too imprecise for the calculations. Presumably % age were
culated on IP = 60 days so the authors should be clearer about this.
sponse: Many thanks for this enquiry. In this section we are describing calculation of
ching and emergence success, as well as the proportion of eggs dying at each
elopmental stage (zero – three) and the mean number of embryos in each clutch that
d during each of the stages. The duration of each stage was calculated specifically for
h clutch (because the incubation period varied among clutches). A detailed description
how this was calculated is described in lines 187 – 194 of the manuscript. However, to
rify this in the preceding paragraph we have amended lines 173 – 176 of the text to
te, “Similarly, the mean number of embryos dying per day of incubation during each
elopmental stage was computed because stages and incubation duration differed
ong clutches. Computing the estimated time to complete each developmental stage
hin a clutch is detailed in the following section”.
mment: (Lines 162 +) Hatched turtles that do not emerge from the nest cannot be
sidered as embryonic mortality. The reasons for their deaths may be very different. The
hors should separate out these values and analyse them separately; ideally with
ather conditions during the brief hatching period being considered separately too. This
uld lead to a better understanding of how rainfall or temperature impact on pre-
ergent hatchling survival.
sponse: Many thanks for your suggestion. However, we do not see a functional
erence in pre- and post-hatching mortality from an environmental point of view. The aim
his manuscript was to identify the overall effect of climate conditions on developmental
cess and hatchling recruitment, and if a hatchling does not emerge from the nest it is
recruited. However, to clarify that we acknowledge and understand the distinction
ween pre- and post-hatching mortality, we have stated the following in lines 165-168 of
text, “Dead hatchlings that failed to emerge from the nest were also included in this
er field stage so that a clear and functional explanation of factors affecting overall
chling recruitment in this population could be obtained”.
mment: (Lines 178 +) Rain can arrive in a heavy storm or steadily over a period of
s. The same amount of water may fall but in a storm air gaps in nesting substrates will
saturated quickly but over prolonged light rain they may remain free of water. This is
important consideration that the authors need to address in their thinking about their
a.
sponse: Many thanks for your comment. However, variation in rainfall patterns at this
scale is beyond the resolution of our data set to examine. Additionally, we believe that
use of multiple years of data in our study will smooth out the minor variations in rainfall
terns during the course of each year. Therefore we have made no amendments to the
nuscript on this occasion.
mment: (Lines 192-193) Rain will impact on embryos in a variety of ways - during late
elopment saturation of nesting substrates reduces available oxygen leading to rapid
oxia. This will potentially kill late term embryos, which have the highest oxygen
mands. The role that oxygen availability will play in nests is barely touched upon so
eds greater consideration in this manuscript.
sponse: Thank you for this comment. In our discussion, we initially focused on the
itive impact that precipitation had on survival, which is what we found during our
estigation. However, to clarify the impact that precipitation and temperature have on
gen availability during later stages of development, we have amended the discussion
now read, “Increased precipitation at the end of development may promote survival
ough several mechanisms related mainly to temperature regulation. High temperatures
gatively impact survival by decreasing oxygen diffusion in the nest. This phenomenon is
ticularly relevant during later stages of development when embryonic oxygen demand
highest”. Furthermore, we feel that we have accurately and succinctly addressed the
gative impacts of precipitation (including hypoxia) in relation to early stage mortality
es 377 – 389) so have made no further changes.
mment: (Lines 206) Missing data - for what? Indicate what data are missing.
sponse: Given the extensive and large-scale nature of the data used in this study, it is
urprising that there were occasional gaps in the nesting, temperature and precipitation
a that we obtained. However, these omissions were significant during years 1991 and
01 when considered collectively, so these years were excluded from analysis. We have
rified this in lines 215 – 217 of the text by stating, “Furthermore, collective data for all
iables were unavailable during 1991 and 2001 so these years were excluded from
alysis”.
mment: (Lines 230) A section describing the actual climatic conditions - means and
ges would be really helpful at the start of this results section.
sponse: As suggested, we have included additional data in the result section of the
nuscript, which now states, “Mean minimum, maximum and average temperature
ing the primary nesting months (June – August) ranged from 24.7 – 26.4<U+F0B0>C, 30.2 –
4<U+F0B0>C and 28.1 – 29.2<U+F0B0>C, respectively, throughout the study period. Total accumulated
cipitation during these months ranged from 103 – 285 mm. There were no statistical
nds in any of these mentioned climate variables over time, and none were significantly
ated to overall hatching success or emergence rate (P > 0.1)”.
mment: (Lines 233-234) Indicate times scale.
sponse: The text has been clarified to read, “Kendall’s tau non-parametric correlation
t was used to investigate the annual trends in overall mean hatching success,
ergence rate, the mean, maximum and minimum air temperature, and mean
umulated precipitation experienced by nests during the primary incubation months
ne – August) over the 20 year period, and the relationship of each of these variables to
h other”.
mment: (Lines 238) Stage zero cannot be confirmed as embryos (see above) so this
eds revision.
sponse: This has been addressed in a previous response, in which we discuss the
ong empirical data that supports the classification of stage zero eggs as being due to
bryonic death.
mment: (Lines 257-260 / 271-273 / 283-284) An indication of the actual ranges of
ues experienced here will help in understanding the impacts.
sponse: Please see the previous response regarding the inclusion of additional data in
results section.
mment: (Lines 292-293) Presumably these are mean values - error bars should be
icated in graphs to show the variation in these means between years.
sponse: Hierarchical partitioning is a method for producing relative importance values
milar to a random forests analysis for example), except based on linear models rather
n conditional inference trees. Thus, the bars in the figure should be viewed as unitless
ect sizes, and it is not typically the case that error bars are added to them. Although it
ht be possible to conceive of a way to generate errors for a set of hierarchical
titioning model values (i.e. through bootstrapping the dataset and using the
otstrapped datasets to generate a distribution of hierarchical values), we do not think
t attempting to devise and implement such a method here would be warranted.
wever, we acknowledge that readers may be confused by the absence of error bars so
e therefore included the following line in the legend for figures 2 and 3, “Values shown
unitless effect sizes and there is no standard accepted method for generating standard
ors for these values. Thus no error bars are shown”.
mment: (Lines 294-295) What about effects on patterns of egg loss and late-stage
rtality?
sponse: For reasons previously addressed, the stages of mortality will remain as stated
the original version of the manuscript. For this reason, “egg loss” is not applicable.
wever, late stage (or stage three) mortality is addressed in lines 288 – 295 of the
nuscript which states, “The top-ranked model for stage three also included precipitation
ing that developmental stage, as well as temperature during the stage, which explained
% of the variation in stage three mortality. Increased mortality at stage three was
ociated with decreased precipitation and increased temperature during the
elopmental stage. Hierarchical partitioning supported the selection of precipitation
ing developmental stage as the most important variable influencing both stages zero
d three mortality within a clutch, with independent contributions of 52% and 70%,
pectively”.
mment: (Lines 301-302) "Stable" - the temperature fluctuated a lot so what do the
hors actually mean here?
sponse: Thank you for this valid point. This line has been removed from text.
mment: (Lines 310) The actual mean temps are 5-8 C lower than these temperatures.
indication of temperature ranges experienced are problematic in interpreting actual
perature experienced by eggs in this study.
sponse: As previously addressed, a section reporting climate variable ranges has been
ded to the results. Additionally, reference to the significance of these ranges has been
dressed in the discussion section.
mment: (Lines 329-341) What is point of this paragraph? The mean temp is at the
otal temperature so why the emphasis on what might happen?
sponse: This paragraph has now been amended. Please see previous comment
arding the structure of the new discussion on the implications of TSD in this population.
mment: (Lines 370-372) Hypoxia is more likely to kill late-term embryos because of
ir high O2 demands than early embryos. As indicated above the importance of oxygen
underground nests impacted by waterlogging has been understated here - this should
resolved.
sponse: Please see previous comment regarding our discussion on hypoxia within the
t.
mment: (Figures 2 & 3) The data presented are bit counter-intuitive - the authors need
make it clearer the direction by which factors such as precipitation and temperature are
acting on the variables.
sponse: Thank you for comment. Figures two and three represent a standard method
reporting results from hierarchical partitioning analyses. A detailed description of the
act that precipitation and temperature are having on nesting variables is included in
s 273 – 295 of the results section. Additionally, referee #2 commented that this
cription of our findings was “very interesting and valuable”. We have therefore left the
t unchanged.
mment: (Figures 4 & 5) These could be combined if colour was used. Grey lines never
roduce well. Same applied to Figures 6 & 7.
sponse: Many thanks for this helpful suggestion. All four figures have been amended
that they more clearly communicate the trends in data.
mment: Undeveloped eggs could reflect a change over time for fertility so stages zero
d three should be illustrated over time to show any patterns.
sponse: Please refer to the previous discussion regarding egg fertility and early
bryonic death. Additionally, an analysis of mortality (stages zero and three) over time
lded no significant trends. In both instances the R2 correlation coefficient was < 0.01.
these reasons we have decided that the suggested figure would not add any additional
ength to the manuscript and it has therefore not been included.
viewer: 2
mment: (Lines 35 - 37) Is it typical to include statistics in the abstract? Most journals
courage it.
sponse: Thank you, the statistics have been removed from the abstract.
mment: (Lines 45) Suggest egg death instead of death.
sponse: Many thanks, this suggestion has been incorporated.
mment: (Lines 165) What about eggs invaded by plant roots? Were they excluded from
analysis or lumped into category 0?
sponse: All eggs that died of extrinsic causes were excluded from analysis. To clarify
, the following sentence has been added to the manuscript, “Eggs that died of extrinsic
ses (e.g. invasion by plant roots or predation) were excluded”.
mment: (Lines 173) This station is fairly remote to the Sandy Point Beach. The airport
ather is more likely to reflect the precipitation at Sandy Point. Like many Caribbean
nds with large hills/small mountains in the interior, the temperatures and precipitation
er significantly on one side vs. the other.
sponse: We appreciate that this may be the case and every effort was made to obtain
ate data that most closely resembled the conditions experienced at the nesting beach.
fortunately, the only dataset available from Southeast Regional Climate Center during
period of investigation in this location was the dataset that we used. While some local
tial variation is possible, there is no reason to think that the dataset does not accurately
resent the temporal variation in weather affecting the study site that was the focus over
duration of our study.
mment: (Lines 177) Mean is less likely to be important to survival than maximum and
imum temperatures. Those should be available as well.
sponse: These values have been reported in a new section added to the results
tion. Additionally, the significance of these data is now also addressed in the
cussion.
mment: (Lines 210) It would be helpful (and help support the methods more strongly)
have an appendix of supplementary section that gives that assumptions of these R
kages and functions. I am finding more and more frequently that people are using the
ode without knowing or showing that the assumption have been met.
sponse: Using the 'dredge' function to conduct an all subsets model selection
cedure, and hierarchical partitioning, depend on the underlying assumptions of the
ar model being met. Visual assessment of qq plots and residual vs fitted plot for full
dels was conducted first, and then, where partial models were selected as being
entially meaningful, these were also checked for assumptions of normally distributed
d equal variances of residuals. All plots were within acceptable ranges for these
umptions. To clarify that we checked these assumptions we have added the following
t to the manuscript, “Test significance was assumed if P < 0.05 and verification of
del assumptions was conducted prior to analysis”.
mment: (Lines 236) But what are the ranges or measures of variation. Leatherbacks
notorious for having nest means (as a measure of central tendency) that are
aningless because of the high variation.
sponse: Please see previous comment regarding these data.
mment: (Lines 264) Emergence rate and embryo mortality really aren't comparable
ues because they deal with different outcomes in development.
sponse: We recognise that this is the case, and for this reason we have dealt with each
iable separately during the analysis. Separate models were run for hatching success,
ergence rate, and each stage of embryo mortality (stages zero – three). The outcome
each model is reported individually in the results section of the manuscript.
mment: (Lines 270 - 271) This is an awkward sentence. Try breaking it up, or
rtening it.
sponse: Many thanks. The sentence has been amended to now read, “Both statistical
thods agree that the variable most likely to influence clutch emergence rate is
cipitation during incubation, which significantly strengthens this finding”.
mment: (Lines 287) This and the previous paragraph are all very interesting and
uable. I hope these analyses are related to the biotic process that are affected by
cipitation and temperature when I get to the discussion.
sponse: Thank you for the positive feedback. We have addressed the significance of
se interesting findings in the discussion section of the manuscript.
mment: (Lines 291) Mean temperatures are the broad brush. Max and min
peratures often are more acute in their actions. I would like to see time at min and
x temperatures included.
sponse: Please see the previous response regarding the inclusion of additional data in
results section.
mment: (Lines 326) You haven't provided evidence that such would be the case. In
t, just a few sentences earlier, you indicated that the lethal temperatures have not been
efully examined for leatherback embryos.
sponse: Many thanks for this comment. The paragraph in question has now been
ended to read, “Ambient air temperature was used as a proxy for sand temperature
ing this study and is a widely accepted alternative in the absence of direct sand
asurements. Interestingly, the mean maximum temperatures reported herein (~30 –
C) coincide with data published by Garrett et al (2010) that showed maximum within
t temperatures of ~31 – 36<U+F0B0>C at this site. The elevated temperature in this latter study
s likely due to metabolic heating in the nest chamber, which can’t be captured with
bient air measurements. Binckley et al (1998) documented an increase in leatherback
le nest temperatures of up to 7<U+F0B0>C due to metabolic heating, which begins as early as
middle third of incubation. Further, eggs in the centre of a nest experience a greater
perature change and have a lower developmental success than those at the periphery,
ough we could not associate egg location with developmental fate in this investigation.
vertheless, the data reported in this study, and Garrett et al (2010), suggest that the
peratures experienced at SPNWR are within the tolerance range for leatherback
bryos at this site.
mment: (Lines 334) A number of papers speculate that such is the case, but do not
monstrate that TSD can't buffer in sea turtles. Some speculate that it can. Revisit the
ent TSD literature.
sponse: As previously addressed, the discussion section has been amended to
dress the implications of TSD in this population, and now states, “At SPNWR, the
rall mean air temperature during incubation from 1990 – 2010 was 28.2<U+F0B0>C, which is
se to the pivotal temperature for TSD for this species. At these higher temperatures, it is
usible to hypothesise that primary sex ratios may be heavily female biased at SPNWR,
is the case at other nesting sites. Historically, the production of more females at higher
peratures provided an evolutionary advantage because it offset rising mortality levels
increasing fecundity. However, there are concerns that a continued reduction in male
chling output and a subsequent decline or elimination of breeding adult males as a
ult of climate change may have serious detrimental effects on population stability.
wever, recent analysis suggests that female-biased hatchling sex ratios translate into
anced operational sex ratios, until extreme temperatures result in embryonic mortality.
ditionally, a recent investigation of sex ratios in the breeding adults at SPNWR revealed
2 males for every female, implying that the operational sex ratio is balanced in this
eding stock. The stability of the temperature at this site over the last two decades also
gests that this may be the steady state for this population”.
mment: (Lines 390 - 399) This section on climate change goes well beyond your study.
it.
sponse: As suggested, this paragraph has been removed from the manuscript.
mment: (Lines 403 - 407) This conclusion seems off topic for the rest of the paper.
sponse: Many thanks. The conclusion has now been amended in accordance with the
nuscript changes to read, “In conclusion, our findings suggest that despite influencing
hin nest mortality, climatic variability does not account for the overall decrease in
chling output at SPNWR from 1990 – 2010. Further research is therefore needed to
it the reasons for this regional decline. Continued monitoring of hatchling output and
ervation of trends in climate variables at this site will assist in early identification of
entially detrimental changes if they arise in the future”.
mment: (Lines 417) These data seems to be owned by USFWS. Do the authors have
mission to post the data?
sponse: Our agreement with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)
arding publication of data was “Assurance that any products from this project, including
d copy, printed or published and Internet presentation of the data contain the logos of
h organization that has participated in the data production. Any publication in peer-
iewed journals will also appropriately acknowledge these organizations. Authorship of
h publications will adhere to generally accepted standards for authorship of scientific
cles, through the consideration of conceptual, data collection, data production, editing
d managerial contributions by collaborators”. We have included detailed text in the
nding and Acknowledgments sections of the manuscript in line with these requirements.
ditionally, we will discuss publication of the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and
tural Resources (VIDPNR) and USFWS logos with RSOS directly if the manuscript is
epted.
mment: (Figure 4) How does air temperature relate to sand or nest temperature. This
g-term study must have accessible thermal data. See Garrett et al. Possibly Conrad et
Both of these studies were after 2000.
sponse: Please see previous comment pertaining to the amended discussion section in
ich we address the within nest temperatures reported by Garrett et al (2010). The
cussion now states, “Interestingly, the mean maximum temperatures reported herein
0 – 32<U+F0B0>C) coincide with data published by Garrett et al (2010) that showed maximum
hin nest temperatures of ~31 – 36<U+F0B0>C at this site. The elevated temperature in this latter
dy was likely due to metabolic heating in the nest chamber, which can’t be captured
h ambient air measurements”.
mment: (Figures 5 and 6) It seems this figure 6 needs to be paired with figure 5.
nding alone, neither graph is that effective but together they should be useful.
sponse: Thank you for this suggestion. Figures 4 – 6 have been merged and amended
that they now more clearly communicate the data.
