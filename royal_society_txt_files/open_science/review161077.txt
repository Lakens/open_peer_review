An important contribution to the literature on bats and lighting that is well worth publishing.
However, the current analysis needs revision since you have used only techniques for unpaired
data, even though you describe the study as 'essentially a pairwise comparison'. In addition,
Figures 2 and 3 look superb, but aren't actually very good at conveying information to the reader;
they need replacing by more functional conventional barcharts, either stacked with respect to the
categories of bat presence, or separate bars with standard errors. (See Appendix A.)

Age of enlightenment: effects of aesthetic lights on brown long-eared bats in churches
Rydell et al.
General:
This is a short and clear paper, which provides useful information on a subject of great
conservation importance. It shows that artificial illumination of historical buildings, churches
essentially, is detrimental to Plecotus bats in Sweden, as long as all building walls and sides are
lit. The analysis is based on both longitudinal data (churches previously unlit that have been
equipped with floodlights in between, and how this correlates with abandonment by bats) and a
comparison of contemporaneous lit vs unlit churches in terms of occupancy by bats. Although
these findings have clear implications for bat conservation management, the analysis might be a
bit too much simplistic. In effect, merely splitting the churches in two categories (lit vs unlit)
might mask further underlying mechanisms that may be as detrimental to bats as light
3
installation. In particular, church illumination often takes place simultaneously to general
restoration work, and the transformation of attics and roofs might under some circumstances
represent a greater risk than equipping the building with floodlights. I am quite convinced that
the authors are right in blaming artificial lights but in the absence of information about that other
potentially confounding factors such architectural change it is difficult to be conclusive. I thus
suggest the authors to provide more information on renovation history.
Title:
Perhaps the title should make clear that this is about outdoor aesthetic lights.
Introduction
35 – “particularly when the lights were applied from all directions.” This should be “specifically
when the lights were applied from all directions.”
51– Should be “For nocturnal animals such as most bats”
53 – Suggest modification to include ecological processes too. E.g. “and the bats’ response to light
depends on the species [7], the prevailing conditions [8], and the ecological process involved…”
(e.g. emergence from roost, commuting, feeding or drinking). Supporting references would be:
• Emergence from roost - Downs et al 2003 Biol. Cons. 111: 247-252
• Commuting - Hale et al 2015 Global Change Biology 21, 7, 2467–2478
• Feeding - Shoeman 2015 Anim. Cons. 19: 120-130.
• Drinking – Russo et al. 2017 Anim. Cons. In press
101 – Good that this is noted, but perhaps address this point in the discussion. There is some
evidence that tree cover can mitigate negative lighting effects on bats, e.g.:
• Mathews et al 2014 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 370
• Hale et al 2015 Global Change Biology 21, 7, 2467–2478
And possibly
• Jenkins, (1998). Animal behaviour, 56(4), 909-917.
Materials and methods:
– needs something about the statistics and software, even if they were very basic.
Results:
Figs 2/3 – A nice graphic, but it is difficult to extract the actual numbers of churches from it. Is
the % of churches with bats indicated by the end point of the church roof?
190 – Not sure the second paragraph in the section Colony sizes and behavior in response to light
should go into the results. These are nice observations of the emergence behaviour that support
the key results. However, as there is no clear methodology or empirical data related to the
statement on emergence, it should not be in the results, in my opinion, but would be useful in the
discussion.
Discussion
Very good – nice caveats regarding other disturbance linked to lighting, such as renovation, but I
would like to see real data on that. Try also to better assess the possible effect of other
confounding factors, ruling them out from rationale if no data at hand.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
First, I must say I am not satisfied with the way the authors replied to reviewers' comments in
general. They should have detailed the operated changes in their 'rebuttal' letter in a more
specific way. This means the reviewer is redirected to the whole text that must thus be appraised
in full a second time. Time demanding...
Second, although the new version is certainly ameliorated, I think there remains a serious
problem: no quantitative data is provided regarding renovation work which was probably
carried out between the two very distant temporal surveys at several churches (and not
8
necessarily in parallel to floodlight installation). I had suggested to add such quantitative
information. If not available currently, it can certainly be retrieved from parish and/or
community registers. Without info about this potential confounding factor, the authors cannot be
conclusive in my opinion. I therefore urge them to complete their dataset and analysis by
incorporating this crucial info.
Third, at the least the main objectives of the comparison should be made clearer in the
introduction, with framing some general questioning of the sort:
"Given the potential impact of exterior lighting installations on the persistence of bat colonies in
churches, we undertook a study to address the following questions:
1) Does the frequency of colony presence differ between churches lit by flood lights and churches
that were not lit?
2) Do the frequencies of colony presence differ between churches that were once dark, but
subsequently lit, and churches that have remained dark over time?
As far as we know this is the first study of the long-term consequences of the installation of
aesthetic lights on buildings with bat colonies."
The fact that the study has pioneer character in a very important conservation field and in
addition uses long-term data may justify publication despite the caveats described under point 2,
but the whole would benefit for a better guidance of the reader about the intentions of the article.

This is an important paper for evidence-based conservation. The effects of artifical lighting on
biodiversity have been much researched in recent years, but almost all studies to date have
focussed on streetlights, with little consideration of building lighting. The results of this study
clearly support the hypothesis that artificial light directed on the outside of historic buildings
such as churches can cause bats to desert roost sites. These traditional roost sites my have been
occupied for decades or longer, and if bats move to new sites, there is a high chance that their
fitness may be lowered. This is important as bats have high levels of protection in Europe, and
intentionally disturbing roosting bats can be a criminal offence. The paper will therefore provide
evidence that will provide better protection for bat roosts. The study is based on a unique and
large long-term data set, but has implications for the conservation of light-sensitive bats
worldwide. It also suggests that careful lighting and mitigation may be successful, permitting a
win-win situation for both bats and churches. The manuscript has been reviewed before, and the
authors have dealt with renovation as a possible confounding variable with care. The writing
style is concise and clear, and I have only a few suggestions for further improvement.
1. Is the likelihood of detecting bats in churches dependent on time of the summer, and
was the timing of visits (across months) similar in the historic and 2016 datasets?
2. A few suggestions to improve English a) line 126, change ;’spotted’ to ‘observed’; b) line
261 ‘rephrase ‘On the lighter side’ as this is ambiguous in the current context; c) reference 30
should be ‘Schoeman’.
3. Around line 222 I would make more of the implications for light-sensitive species. Zeale
et al. (2016) showed that light inside churches ‘traps’ bats (Myotis nattereri) inside roosts. I
suspect that the species listed on 222 will be sensitive to external lighting in the same way as
Plecotus studied here, and buildings used by these species should not be subjected to external
lighting as a precautionary measure.
4. Some of the figure/table legends can be improved. There is no legend to Fig. 1, there is
no description of how to interpret the ESM, and the grid lines should be removed from the
graphs.
12
5. The suggested cover image is highly relevant and stunning.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an important paper for evidence-based conservation. The effects of artifical lighting on
biodiversity have been much researched in recent years, but almost all studies to date have
focussed on streetlights, with little consideration of building lighting. The results of this study
clearly support the hypothesis that artificial light directed on the outside of historic buildings
such as churches can cause bats to desert roost sites. These traditional roost sites my have been
occupied for decades or longer, and if bats move to new sites, there is a high chance that their
fitness may be lowered. This is important as bats have high levels of protection in Europe, and
intentionally disturbing roosting bats can be a criminal offence. The paper will therefore provide
evidence that will provide better protection for bat roosts. The study is based on a unique and
large long-term data set, but has implications for the conservation of light-sensitive bats
worldwide. It also suggests that careful lighting and mitigation may be successful, permitting a
win-win situation for both bats and churches. The manuscript has been reviewed before, and the
authors have dealt with renovation as a possible confounding variable with care. The writing
style is concise and clear, and I have only a few suggestions for further improvement.
1. Is the likelihood of detecting bats in churches dependent on time of the summer, and
was the timing of visits (across months) similar in the historic and 2016 datasets?
2. A few suggestions to improve English a) line 126, change ;’spotted’ to ‘observed’; b) line
261 ‘rephrase ‘On the lighter side’ as this is ambiguous in the current context; c) reference 30
should be ‘Schoeman’.
3. Around line 222 I would make more of the implications for light-sensitive species. Zeale
et al. (2016) showed that light inside churches ‘traps’ bats (Myotis nattereri) inside roosts. I
suspect that the species listed on 222 will be sensitive to external lighting in the same way as
Plecotus studied here, and buildings used by these species should not be subjected to external
lighting as a precautionary measure.
4. Some of the figure/table legends can be improved. There is no legend to Fig. 1, there is
no description of how to interpret the ESM, and the grid lines should be removed from the
graphs.
5. The suggested cover image is highly relevant and stunning.

mments on ‘Age of enlightenment: effects of esthetic lights on brown long-eared bats in
rches’
neral thoughts
s is a very useful study providing valuable evidence of conservation importance. However, it
ds some relatively minor changes to the presentation and discussion, and some more
damental revision to the statistical analyses. Fortunately, the results are sufficiently clear-cut
t the main conclusions are unlikely to be altered by the changes to the analysis.
ecific points
e, line 26, line 78, line 106: the words ‘esthetic’, ‘esthetical’ and ‘aesthetical’ are all used. I
uld suggest using ‘aesthetic’ in all cases, reflecting the most common usage in British English.
en first used in the text, it might be sensible to expand on this, explaining the main features of
lights considered. In lines 111-114 you contrast the lights with ‘weaker non-directional lights’,
it would also be worth distinguishing them from floodlights used for security purposes. The
er are frequently mounted high, illuminating downwards, whereas the lights used for aesthetic
sons in Figure 1 point upwards to illuminate the building. I wonder if this difference is important
he bats. See the comments in ref 9 on ‘sky glow’.
oduction: the introduction is very focussed on predation, whereas other recent papers have
cribed a broader range of impacts from lighting, including positive as well as negative effects.
example, see the recent paper by Lewanzik & Voigt in J. Applied Ecology.
e 104: ‘therefore most of the variation remained constant over the study period’. The word
refore’ doesn’t seem appropriate. Maybe rephrase along the lines of ‘it is likely that there is
paratively little temporal variation in habitat and other potential confounding variables’.
e 143: ‘loud’ seems an odd word to use in the context of the quiet calls of this species.
haps ‘relatively loud’?
tistical issues
her’s exact test: according to line 103 the ‘study is essentially a pairwise comparison’, but all
mal testing uses Fisher’s exact test, which is not appropriate for paired data. To exploit the
er of the pairwise design, McNemar’s test is needed. Alternatively, mixed models could be
d, with a random term to allow for the pairing; this offers a number of advantages (e.g. paired
unpaired data could be included in the same analysis), but is perhaps excessive given the size
he dataset and the bias in the initial sample. Fisher’s exact test is, of course, perfectly valid for
lyses using just one of the periods, since there is no pairing of the data.
e 164: including the church where lights had been non-functional for many years in the
minated group seems counter-intuitive.
e 186: ‘md’ needs to be written in full (could be either median or mode).
e 170-175: This seems to be the key evidence presented, but it currently not backed up by any
istical test. This is where McNemar’s test is needed to show that the decline is greater in those
rches where lighting has been installed, compared to those where it hasn’t. Also, since there
some bias in the original selection (line 87), a decline might result from regression to the mean
natural turnover could bring the upwardly biased sample back down towards the mean).
nce it is vital to consider these figures in the context of those from the same sample that were
t, as indeed is done verbally in lines 181-183.
ures 2 and 3: whilst these figures look very attractive and might be ideal for a press release or
graphic, I don’t think they are a good way of conveying the information to a scientific audience.
mparing the relative heights of standard bars is much easier for the reader than is the case with
plex shapes such as the church silhouettes. Using stacked bars would make it clear that those
fresh remains were a subset of those with colonies present. Also, it is necessary to read the
tion to understand the figure properly (I misunderstood it until I read the caption properly),
ereas a standard bar chart with a legend and proper labelling of the axes could be easily
erstood at a glance by a reader flicking through the paper (and of course that is what we all
e to do most of the time, due to the volume of published literature).
pplementary material: the data is a bit messy with lots of question marks and plus symbols. It
uld be better to convert to numeric or categorical columns as far as possible, with a comment
umn to explain anything else. Otherwise it is difficult for the reader to be able to understand
the question marks are interpreted, and hence the analyses cannot be easily reproduced.

Comments to the Author(s)
An important contribution to the literature on bats and lighting that is well worth publishing.
However, the current analysis needs revision since you have used only techniques for unpaired data,
even though you describe the study as 'essentially a pairwise comparison'. In addition, Figures
2 and 3 look superb, but aren't actually very good at conveying information to the reader; they need
eplacing by more functional conventional barcharts, either stacked with respect to the categories
of bat presence, or separate bars with standard errors.
Response: Changed as suggested; revised analysis and new figures.
Reviewer: 2
General:
This is a short and clear paper, which provides useful information on a subject of great conservation
mportance. It shows that artificial illumination of historical buildings, churches essentially,
s detrimental to Plecotus bats in Sweden, as long as all building walls and sides are lit. The analysis
s based on both longitudinal data (churches previously unlit that have been equipped with floodlights
n between, and how this correlates with abandonment by bats) and a comparison of contemporaneous
it vs unlit churches in terms of occupancy by bats. Although these findings have clear implications
or bat conservation management, the analysis might be a bit too much simplistic. In effect, merely
splitting the churches in two categories (lit vs unlit) might mask further underlying mechanisms
hat may be as detrimental to bats as light installation. In particular, church illumination often
akes place simultaneously to general restoration work, and the transformation of attics and roofs
might under some circumstances represent a greater risk than equipping the building with floodlights.
am quite convinced that the authors are right in blaming artificial lights but in the absence of
nformation about that other potentially confounding factors such architectural change it is difficult
o be conclusive. I thus suggest the authors to provide more information on renovation history
Response. We have provided some more info on restoration and we have and tried to sharpen th
discussion on this point (in discussion)
Title:
Perhaps the title should make clear that this is about outdoor aesthetic lights.
Response. Done
ntroduction
35 – “particularly when the lights were applied from all directions.” This should be “specifically
when the lights were applied from all directions.”
Response. No longer applicable because of slight change in the text.
51– Should be “For nocturnal animals such as most bats”
Response. Done
53 – Suggest modification to include ecological processes too. E.g. “and the bats’ response to light
depends on the species [7], the prevailing conditions [8], and the ecological process involved…”
(e.g. emergence from roost, commuting, feeding or drinking). Supporting references would be:
Emergence from roost - Downs et al 2003 Biol. Cons. 111: 247-252
Commuting - Hale et al 2015 Global Change Biology 21, 7, 2467–2478
Feeding - Shoeman 2015 Anim. Cons. 19: 120-130.
Drinking – Russo et al. 2017 Anim. Cons. In press
Response. References added
101 –
Good that this is noted, but perhaps address this point in the discussion. There is some evidence
hat tree cover can mitigate negative lighting effects on bats, e.g.:
Mathews et al 2014 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 370
Hale et al 2015 Global Change Biology 21, 7, 2467–2478
Response. Potential importance of tree cover near the roost is already included in discussion.
The Mathews reference is added there
And possibly
Jenkins, (1998). Animal behaviour, 56(4), 909-917.
Materials and methods:
– needs something about the statistics and software, even if they were very basic.
Response. Done, package specified
Results:
Figs 2/3 – A nice graphic, but it is difficult to extract the actual numbers of churches from it.
Is the % of churches with bats indicated by the end point of the church roof?
Response. New figures made.
190 –Not sure the second paragraph in the section Colony sizes and behavior in response to light
should go into the results. These are nice observations of the emergence behaviour that support
he key results. However, as there is no clear methodology or empirical data related to the statement
on emergence, it should not be in the results, in my opinion, but would be useful in the discussion.
Response. Paragraph moved to discussion as suggested.
Discussion
Very good – nice caveats regarding other disturbance linked to lighting, such as renovation, but
would like to see real data on that. Try also to better assess the possible effect of other confounding
actors, ruling them out from rationale if no data at hand.
Response. We have provided some more info on restoration and other potentially confounding
actors and we have tried to sharpen the discussion on this point.

Appendix C
Dear Reviewer,
Please find our (my) response to your review below.
Response to your comment 1. I am really sorry for this and apologize. Now when I look at
my previous response again, I agree that it was kept unnecessarily short and not very
nformative. I never thought about it then, however, but hopefully learnt something!
Comment 2. Thanks for persisting with this suggestion. We obtained the required
nformation and it resulted in a considerable improvement of the paper, eventually.
The renovation history (after 1980) was obtained for all churches included in the longitudinal
comparison. The data were entered in a new table (table 1) which I think is quite informative.
t shows significant decline of bats only in churches that were not renovated. Renovation can
be ruled out as the reason for bat disappearance in all except the five specific cases where bats
disappeared from churches at which light installation and renovation coincided.
The result shown in table 1 is commented in a new paragraph of the result section (page 7,
ine 195-210) and a new paragraph explaining how we obtained and analysed the renovation
data is added to the Material and Methods (p. 5-6, line 141-151). The discussion paragraph
about renovation has been rewritten totally and the speculative and anecdotal statements
emoved (new paragraph found on p. 9, line 250-259). A new excel table with the renovation
data included has been submitted as ESM.
n the Materials and methods section a short addition on the possible confounding effect of
enovation was also added (p. 4, line 91).
Comment 3. Yes, I certainly agree that an addition like this was needed. The specific aim of
he paper is now stated in the last paragraph of the intro along the lines you suggested, using
wo questions (page 3 line 57-61).
Thanks again for critical and constructive reviewing and for being persistent about the need
of a quantitative analysis of the effect of renovations. We admit that this addition was indeed
crucial and it certainly made our point more convincing.
Sincerely
Jens Rydell

Final comments to reviewer
Please find our response in red
1. Is the likelihood of detecting bats in churches dependent on time of the summer, and
was the timing of visits (across months) similar in the historic and 2016 datasets?
Reply: Good comment that we have not thought about. A paragraph is added to clarify our
view on page 3, line 79-85.
2. A few suggestions to improve English a) line 126, change ;’spotted’ to ‘observed’;
b) line 261 ‘rephrase ‘On the lighter side’ as this is ambiguous in the current context;
c) reference 30 should be ‘Schoeman’.
Reply: Changes made as suggested except that “spotted” was changed to “recorded” instead
of “observed” in order to avoid repetition of “observed”.
3. Around line 222 I would make more of the implications for light-sensitive species.
Zeale et al. (2016) showed that light inside churches ‘traps’ bats (Myotis nattereri)
nside roosts. I suspect that the species listed on 222 will be sensitive to external
ighting in the same way as Plecotus studied here, and buildings used by these species
should not be subjected to external lighting as a precautionary measure.
Reply: Agree that this was a missing point. The suggested addition has been made in the
discussion, page 9, line 256-260.
4. Some of the figure/table legends can be improved. There is no legend to Fig. 1, there
s no description of how to interpret the ESM, and the grid lines should be removed from
he graphs.
Reply: Legend to fig 1 is and the grid lines are removed from the graphs as suggested. The
ESM consists of an excel table and the very basic statistical tests. I am not sure how “a
description of how to interpret” it should be written.
What about this?
The ESM consists of an excel file with all the data used for this study and also include the
statistical analyses. This sentence is submitted along with the other files.
