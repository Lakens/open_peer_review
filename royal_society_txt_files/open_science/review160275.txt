This manuscript represents a very interesting piece of work, as its two targets are important from
both biological and a systems-theoretical point of view: (i) The establishment of the existence of
power-law-like size distribution in the paralog gene families of the human genome; and (ii) More
importantly, the demonstration that ‘sets of genes’ follow a specific type of size distribution (Beta
rank function) is particularly interesting, as this result concerns gene groups with convergent or
mutually-related functional roles. Thus a distributional property is formulated, which directly
implies biological function.
The proposed explanatory mechanism (the split-merge model) offers a causal basis for this
phenomenology and broadens our understanding of the interweaving between genomic
architecture and function. Although the model is initially formulated by materializing the activity
of human curators of gene set data banks “… our two operations can be considered to be extrinsic
ones imposed by curators”, the analysis offered at the end of the Results and in the Discussion
section shows that this reflects true genomic events and that it is of importance in microarray
data analysis.
The two examples offered at the end of the Discussion, concerning transcription factor genes and
drug target genes corroborate the significance of the application of the Beta rank function in the
treatment of specific groups of genomic entities.
Overall, I believe that this manuscript offers an important contribution in the study of substantial
relations between distributional and functional aspects of genomic composition, particularly
related to needs of gene ontology characterization and quantification and to cutting edge
methodologies, like in microarray analysis techniques. Thus, I recommend its publication in
Royal Society Open Science in its present form.

In this reviewer's opinion, the principal advance described in this manuscript is the proposal,
contained in the section "Simulating a Beta rank function by a split-merge model," that curation
may be a major source of the observed deviation from a power law in the size distribution of gene
families.
This is an interesting and provocative observation that justifies the publication of the manuscript.
By the reasoning behind the authors' split-merge model, whose initial condition is a power law,
one might be tempted to further infer that the deviation (characterized by the beta rank function,
as the authors argue) is an -artifact- of curation ("-" for emphasis). Do the authors agree? why not?
The authors' observation on page 10, "It is a common practice to dismiss the tail which does not
conform to a power-law as finite-size effects, based on the assumption that we do not have
enough samples to observe the true value (Newman, 2005). Although we may gradually improve
the fitting performance of Zipf's law by removing the smaller families...we actually removing
common events by doing so, not rare events as implied in the idea of finite-size effects," is right
on the mark.
On the other hand, they might helpfully provide some sqrt(N) error bars in, for example, the
large size (low rank) regime of figure 2(D). Yes, these points are very well-sampled, and their
values should be taken very seriously. Shouldn't we be particularly concerned about the
(systematic, consistent) deviation of the blue line (albeit not as pronounced as that of the red line)
from the data points?
I have one grave concern about the article, although it can be addressed with a minor revision.
Namely, the authors define "size [S]" on page 2, line 38, as "the number of genes (size) in a
paralog," and summarize the literature on size distributions in a variety of contexts, up to page
3,line 21. So far so good. Then unfortunately they cite Gao and Miller (2014) as further example,
4
although in this line of research it is not "number of genes" whose distribution is studied, but
length, in nucleotides, of homology or paralogy. This distribution is neither a ranked list nor does
it have Zipfian character.
Later in the last paragraph of page 11, they cite Koroteev and Miller, 2011; Gao and Miller, 2011;
Massip and Arndt, 2013; in a different context. In contrast, ranked lists and their Zipfian character
are the topic of all other literature cited.
This is rather like confounding "meters" and "dollars." One is a measure of length - it is a physical
dimension; the other is an arbitrary unit. Certainly, there can be common equations and
dynamics that apply to both, but in this particular case the failure to distinguish is in my
judgement an embarrassing blunder that would suggest that authors are manipulating formalism
without regard to physical content.
There may be consequences for a split-merge model in the context of length distributions, as in
the case of length distributions only physical neighbors in the genome can be merged, which
represents a further constraint on the merge dynamics.
We don't claim that the ideas expressed by the authors here are necessarily inapplicable to length
distributions.
One way to resolve the matter would be to delete from the manuscript all references to
Koroteev and Miller, 2011; Gao and Miller (2011, 2014); Massip and Arndt, 2013. I would find this
to be an acceptable solution.
A further concern - but one I really don't want to argue about - is the misleading and self-
defeating paragraph beginning on page 11, line 46, where the authors remark, "idealizing
complicated processes by a theoretical model ... However, realistic models take much more
efforts to construct as many detailed evolutionary mechanisms and parameter values are
uncertain."
I don't see why the authors find it necessarily to provide fodder for the Newman crowd. Natural
science advances by refinement. It is customary to first observe and then account for a dominant
behavior, and later to observe and account for deviations. Indeed, the foundation and initial
condition of the authors' "split-merge" model is a power-law distribution. I don't see why the
authors feel the need to implicitly devalue preceding advances in the study and modeling of size
distributions in gene families, particularly as the current manuscript is subject to the same
philosophical criticism about idealizing complex models. What is a "realistic" model, anyway?
More detailed and accurate descriptions are always possible, but may not always be useful or
necessary.

would like to thank the two reviewers for a careful reading
the manuscript and valuable feedbacks. We have made the
lowing revisions according to reviewers' comments:
+/- square-root(N) error bar is added to Fig.1(D) and Fig.2(D).
is clear that for top-ranking points, this error bar would
affect the observed value. For low-ranking points (smaller
e family sizes), the envelopped shaded area in Fig.1(D)
ntains the straight line (power-law) and that in Fig. 2(D)
ntains the curve (deviation from power-law), indicating that
conclusions would not be affected by the introduction of error bars.
ce the use of square-root(N) error bar is popular mainly in
tain fields (e.g. high-energy physics), we have added a
erence (Aggarwal and Caldwell (2012)) to refer readers to
ther discussion of its validity.
To avoid confusion, previous publications on other unit sizes
ch are not gene family size (such as DNA segment lengths)
l only be mentioned in the modelling part, and a sentence is
ed to explicit remind readers that that don't model gene size
tributions. Our intention to include these references is
t they tend to lead to a power-law distribution, and the
n mechanism is duplication, similar to the modelling of
er-law distribution of paralog sizes.
We certainly don't want to give an impression that theoretical
elling with simple assumptions is not worthwhile, or that we
critical of these types of work (we were not). We completely agree
h the reviewer that to understand or capture a major feature in
ervations, simple model is needed. We have deleted the misleading
tence from the draft.
e 19, 2016
have added the ORCID link for the corresponding author.
have added the "research ethics", "animal ethics", "permission to
ry out fieldwork", "data availability" at the end the paper.
ce our work is based on public domain data, these items do not
lly apply. We have added them to conform to the requirement.
e 30, 2016
have uploaded files used to generate Figs.1, 2, 4,5 to Dryad with the
: 10.5061/dryad.rc1kv
mention this doi address in the manuscript.
ase let us know if it is the way to do it. We were confused about
t we should do as the original data is from the public domain sources.
files uploaded to dryad do represent some processing of the public
ain raw data, and should be easier (more direct) to use if a reader
ts to reproduce these figures.
