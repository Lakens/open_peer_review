This study is a very interesting investigation of the association between precipitous population
declines and changes in song structure. The authors found that honeycreeper song complexity
was lower following population declines, and that the songs of three different honeycreeper
species were more similar following than prior to declines. I found the manuscript to be very well
written and clear, making it a pleasure to read. I have included suggestions for improvement,
outlined below.
1) Honeycreeper populations did not begin to decline precipitously until the early 2000s (line
676). Is there any information on % population declines during the time song recordings (from
2001-2004) were taken? I think it would help to clarify the association between population
declines and your results from the three different time periods. For example, were the 2001-2004
songs sampled prior to population declines or after a significant portion of the population had
already been lost?
2) Throughout the ms it would help to clarify that three different honeycreeper species are being
considered, rather than individuals. For example, Line 691-692, “Have the present day songs of
Kaua‘i honeycreepers become more similar to one another compared to songs in the past?” clarify
that this is a difference between species rather than individuals.
3) Line 698, are these variations in unique syllables fixed across species? Or is there variation
between individuals?
4) Line 752-753: I think it would be useful here to include the mean and range for the number of
songs analysed per individual. I also think that the sample sizes need to be clearer in the main
ms. Currently they are found in Table S2. In addition, how were honeycreepers individually
identified (caption Table S2); or is there a possibility that some individuals were recorded more
than once?
5) Figure 1. This figure caption needs additional information. Please describe the differences in
song structure observed between the 1970s and present day song (similar to what is described at
Line 904-906). The acoustic characteristics measured are displayed across both the 1970s and
present day song which introduces uncertainty as to whether acoustic characteristics are only
specific to songs from each time period. I would suggest focusing on and identifying the
differences between songs here. If need be, a separate figure with all measured acoustic
characteristics displayed on one spectrogram can be included, such a figure would be well suited
to the supplementary documents.
6) Line 809: Please clarify that 3 different time stamps were sampled over a 40 year period. Here,
and throughout the ms this should be clarified since ‘over a 40-year time period’ suggests
consistent sampling over 40 years.
7) Since the three honeycreeper species songs have increased in similarity, and are almost
indistinguishable in some cases, is there any reason to suspect that hybridization rates between
species will increase? Are these species known to hybridize? Perhaps an interesting point to
include in the discussion of possible future impacts of declining song complexity.

This manuscript investigates changes in song over a forty-year period in three Hawaiian
honeycreeper species that have experienced dramatic population declines over the same period.
The authors make use of historical recordings from the 1970’s and early 2000’s and present day
recordings they made to document changes in the acoustic characteristics and population-level
diversity of songs consistent with the loss of learned variants due to cultural bottlenecks, a result
that is generally predicted but has only been documented in a handful of cases. They also find the
novel and intriguing result that the three species have converged on more similar songs over the
same period, due perhaps to a breakdown of species barriers to learning or alternatively, as a
result of similar selection pressures from changes in the habitat they all share. These results are
likely to be of interest to a broad swath of scientists interested in animal communication, cultural
evolution, and conservation.
Overall the study is well designed and the acoustic and statistical approaches are appropriate to
the questions asked. The authors have paid due attention to potential confounds from different
recording equipment from different time periods, which can be an issue when using historical
samples. They have also considered potential issues posed by non-independence of pairwise
comparisons and of variation in the sample size over different species and periods by avoiding
some comparisons and by redoing some analyses with subsampled datasets. Thus, the
interesting patterns they document seem robust. They are certain interesting as a well-
documented case of loss of cultural diversity and of convergence. Most of my concerns are minor,
and mostly have to do with issues of presentation or, in a few cases, interpretation:
L 639-641. Characterizing complexity of songs is tricky, as is documenting its effect on individual
fitness and population viability, and I think there is a less consistent relationship between the two
across the literature than this statement claims. This critique also applies to lines 939-940. See
MacDougall-Shackleton 1997 and Byers and Kroodsma 2009 for reviews. Give the lack of a clear
relationship between repertoire size and fitness I would question what is cause and effect in the
population declines mentioned in 942-945.
4
L 698. It is a little ambiguous what is meant by “low variability among songs”. I think “from
rendition to rendition by individuals” but it could be among individuals or even species.
L775. Bonferroni corrections can be pretty stringent, so consider whether any results that are
marginal after Bonferroni corrections are still work considering as biologically meaningful
patterns.
L800-802. The ANOVA described is the one analysis in which the non-independence of pairwise
comparisons may violate the assumptions of independent samples for the test employed. I
suggest partial Mantel tests or some more sophisticated form of matrix comparison as an
alternative.
L892-894. The result of convergence among the three species is the most novel one in the paper,
so I think it is a mistake to hide the figure illustrating it in the supplement. I suggest converting
figure 2 into a 4 panel figure in which the PCA’s illustrating the change over time with the three
species and the one showing all 4 species combined as the fourth.
L919-922. Density is certainly one factor that affects how many potential tutors a young bird
encounters, but so is pattern and distance of dispersal. Any information on that parameters
among the three species?
L947-949. Give the convergence in song one might eventually predict a breakdown of species
barriers. Any evidence of an increase in heterospecific pairings or hybrid offspring?
Table 1. It would be better to have column headers that described the parameters themselves (e.g.
mean differences, variability) rather than the statistical test used to test for effects in the
parameters.
Table 2. I found this table and the 95% confidence intervals quite a bit of work to parse mentally.
It think it would be much easier for most readers to absorb if it was a figure illustrating the
change in mean±95% CI for each of the three comparisons by the three time periods.
Fig1. I am a fan of spectrograms, so I would like to see spectrograms of all 3 species at the oldest
and most recent time points, as that would give readers a concrete illustration of the acoustic
changes across time both within and among the three species.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Alecia Carter):
Dear authors,
I have now received two reviews of your manuscript. Both reviewers agree that this study is
interesting and well-executed, and I find myself in agreement. Both reviewers include some
minor, constructive suggestions to help further improve an already well-presented study.
When addressing the reviewers’ comments, I would encourage the authors to consider one
further limitation and an alternative explanation of their data. In the first case, I would have
found these data more convincing if a control species / population of honeycreeper (or other
small passerine) was included in the analysis where there was no decline in population and / or
density and the authors could show that there was no change in song complexity. It may be that
some variable other than population density decline is driving song diversity loss in this genus,
and such a control could have been within the authors’ reach and needs to be addressed. (Please
note that I understand that most, if not all, honeycreepers have declined in Kaua’i, but this
control could be broader and should be mentioned or considered.)
In the second case, the lack of the above control allows alternative explanations to be considered.
In particular, loss of song diversity arises through cultural processes alone, rather than
demographic processes that impact on cultural processes. Importantly, increased complexity is
not always the direction that cultural evolution takes. This is exemplified by humpback whale
songs, where “simple” songs are documented to take over in populations, notably without any
population decline.

novaeangliae) from Tonga." Behaviour (2005): 305-328.
Garland, Ellen C., et al. "Dynamic horizontal cultural transmission of humpback whale song at
the ocean basin scale." Current biology 21.8 (2011): 687-691.
Cultural evolution is far more rapid in this species than in the honeyeaters, but this example does
show that cultural change can result in reduced complexity in sexually-selected songs. Please
consider this alternative explanation.

agree with the associate editor that inclusion of a species that does not have population declines
ld allow for a more definitive conclusion regarding the relationship between population decline and
g complexity. We considered this fact when designing the study, however, all honeycreeper
ulations on Kaua’i and even the non-native Japanese White-eyes have shown declines in the last 25
s. Non-native species that occur in the Alaka’i Plateau that have not shown population declines
de the Japanese bush-warbler and Hwamei. However, given large differences in the structure of their
gs (e.g., non-trill) compared to the species included in this study, it would be hard to measure many of
acoustic characteristics used to assess change in song (e.g. frequency change within a syllable,
uency change within a song) in these non-native species. We have included text in the discussion for
a control species was not included in the study (lines 337-341). In addition, we have included text in
discussion about alternative hypotheses for the loss of complexity in song and the humpback whale
mples (lines 266-269).

igure 1. This figure caption needs additional information. Please describe the differences in song

). The acoustic characteristics measured are displayed across both the 1970s and present day song

period. I would suggest focusing on and identifying the differences between songs here. If need be,
parate figure with all measured acoustic characteristics displayed on one spectrogram can be

uggested, we have focused Figure 1 on differences in songs between the 1970s and present day
periods. In addition, as suggested by reviewer 2, we have included example songs from the 1970s
present day time periods for each species. We made a separate figure, included in the supplemental

ments to the Author(s)
manuscript investigates changes in song over a forty-year period in three Hawaiian honeycreeper
cies that have experienced dramatic population declines over the same period. The authors make use
storical recordings from the 1970’s and early 2000’s and present day recordings they made to
ument changes in the acoustic characteristics and population-level diversity of songs consistent with
oss of learned variants due to cultural bottlenecks, a result that is generally predicted but has only
n documented in a handful of cases. They also find the novel and intriguing result that the three
cies have converged on more similar songs over the same period, due perhaps to a breakdown of
cies barriers to learning or alternatively, as a result of similar selection pressures from changes in the
tat they all share. These results are likely to be of interest to a broad swath of scientists interested in
al communication, cultural evolution, and conservation.
rall the study is well designed and the acoustic and statistical approaches are appropriate to the
stions asked. The authors have paid due attention to potential confounds from different recording
pment from different time periods, which can be an issue when using historical samples. They have
considered potential issues posed by non-independence of pairwise comparisons and of variation in
sample size over different species and periods by avoiding some comparisons and by redoing some
yses with subsampled datasets. Thus, the interesting patterns they document seem robust. They are
ain interesting as a well-documented case of loss of cultural diversity and of convergence. Most of my
cerns are minor, and mostly have to do with issues of presentation or, in a few cases, interpretation:
9-641. Characterizing complexity of songs is tricky, as is documenting its effect on individual fitness
population viability, and I think there is a less consistent relationship between the two across the
ature than this statement claims. This critique also applies to lines 939-940. See MacDougall-
ckleton 1997 and Byers and Kroodsma 2009 for reviews. Give the lack of a clear relationship
een repertoire size and fitness I would question what is cause and effect in the population declines
tioned in 942-945.
have adjusted our wording in both the introduction (lines 41-46) and the discussion (lines 309-310) to
ct that not all species show a consistent relationship between song complexity and fitness.
8. It is a little ambiguous what is meant by “low variability among songs”. I think “from rendition to
ition by individuals” but it could be among individuals or even species.
have clarified our wording in the text to indicate that there is low variability among the songs an
idual sings (lines 90-91)

parisons may violate the assumptions of independent samples for the test employed. I suggest

averaged the pairwise comparisons of the syllables contained in a single song so that there was only
value per song used as the response variable in the two-ANOVA, and thus there is no violation of the
umption of independence. We have added text in the methods to make this more clear (lines 180-
).
2-894. The result of convergence among the three species is the most novel one in the paper, so I
k it is a mistake to hide the figure illustrating it in the supplement. I suggest converting figure 2 into a 4

wing all 4 species combined as the fourth.

separate PCAs conducted for the individual species and all three species combined.
9-922. Density is certainly one factor that affects how many potential tutors a young bird encounters,
so is pattern and distance of dispersal. Any information on that parameters among the three species?
do not have any information on the pattern and distance of dispersal for the three species. We have
orded the sentence so as not to indicate that density is the only factor that can affect the probability of
ountering potential tutors (lines 292-295).
7-949. Give the convergence in song one might eventually predict a breakdown of species
iers. Any evidence of an increase in heterospecific pairings or hybrid offspring?
re is no evidence of hybridization in any of the Hawaiian honeycreepers (Knowlton et al 2014). Given
dea of song convergence potentially leading to an increased chance of hybridization we have
ded a sentence in the discussion talking about this concept (lines 310-312).
le 1. It would be better to have column headers that described the parameters themselves (e.g. mean
rences, variability) rather than the statistical test used to test for effects in the parameters.
uggested, we have changed the column headers to describe the parameters tested. The columns are
: “Differences among time periods” and “Variability within time periods”
le 2. I found this table and the 95% confidence intervals quite a bit of work to parse mentally. It think it
ld be much easier for most readers to absorb if it was a figure illustrating the change in mean±95% CI
ach of the three comparisons by the three time periods.
have retained the quantitative data showing the convergence of songs as a Table given that we 1)
ed the supplemental figure showing the convergence of songs among the three species to the main
er – Figure 3, and 2) included representative spectrograms for each species during the 1970s and
ent day time period showing examples of convergence in songs – Figure 1. However, if the editor
s a figure would better represent the data in Table 2, we can easily make this table into a figure.
. I am a fan of spectrograms, so I would like to see spectrograms of all 3 species at the oldest and
t recent time points, as that would give readers a concrete illustration of the acoustic changes across
both within and among the three species.
