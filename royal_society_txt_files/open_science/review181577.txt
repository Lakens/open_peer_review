A position paper/review that compares and contrasts the fields and efforts in the control of
invasive biologicals (plants, insects, others), and those in the control of emerging infectious
diseases. The connections between those fields are still largely distinct, and populated by
different researchers, but they make a good case that there are many connections in the
introduction, initial establishment, emergence and spread of the two types of invasives. Many of
the same skills are used in the two fields, and in modeling the different steps involved, indicating
that the disciplines can share skills and models. They build this around the so-called One Health
model, which is reasonable, and they include some well thought out/diagrammatic models of the
steps involved in analysis and control of each type of invasion/emergence. Overall a useful
contribution to the fields involved, and it will be interesting to see if the cooperation between the
fields can be accomplished.
A few issues to consider;
1) They seem to leave out or at least not explicitly include an important component of the One
Health effort - the medical communities (human and veterinary). Perhaps the invasive studies do
not obviously connect up, but the emerging diseases would do?
2) A few jargon words that I am not immediately sure of the definition - disservices? Maybe those
can be defined or a glossary included.
3) They do not explicitly seem to show how the fields are connected by invasive vectors
(mosquitoes, ticks, others) and that provide a pathway for the diseases that take advantage of
those to spread into new areas.
4) The term pre-adaptation is unclear to me, and perhaps not really an accurate definition of
certain mutations. Not sure what is meant by "eco-evolutionary experience". Mutations arise and
selected in an environment, which may favor spread in another environment - not sure if that is
pre-adaptation as it implies some forshadowing of future selections in other environments?
5) Page 6 - ii) - Compatibility? For disease emergence this would also include population size,
density and connectedness?
6) Page 6 - Would be "as for non-disease-causing invasive..."
7) Page 8 - Not sure that EIDs are typically obligate parasites, or of vertebrates. Many could be
opportunistic; also could equally well emerge in invertebrates (or plants or prokaryotes)?
8) Page 9 - "relatively recently" is cited to a 2001 paper - almost a generation ago.
9) Page 9 - determining parameters of the different components of the emergence/invasion
systems would be needed for proper control strategies?
10) Page 10 - what is the data showing that funding is "orders of magnitude" less for invasion
studies.
11) Page 10 - why is only the European CDCD cited? Most counties have organizations with
similar responsibilities that might be mobilized? What are the organizations that address invasive
transmission?
12) Figure 3 - This is an odd diagram and unclear - perhaps the barriers need to be extended
across the different columns to make it clear what it is showing.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The paper you have submitted says, in the title, that it’s a call for closer collaboration and, on p. 3
line 52, that it’s a review. In p. 3 lines 46-7 you say the ideas are not new. In my view, your paper
is a very useful and thorough survey of some relevant science. The science is embedded in
phrases that say that both invasionists and epidemiologists ‘require’ (p 12 line 7) a joint One
Health approach. You need to say, both in the title and early on, that the paper is both a call and
a review and to connect the two more clearly. In particular you need clearer arguments that
invasion scientists and epidemiologists would produce better results than working separately
and, also, why those two disciplines. Are not e.g. socio-economic factors important in the
management of EIDs and invasions? Is there not an organisation and journal called EcoHealth
working on that? See vol 15 part 2, June 2018 for a symposium on EIDs and economics. Maybe
you should also look at EPPO (The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization)
and give more attention to plant diseases.
I think though that the chief weakness is that you don’t say enough about One Health as an
organisation. What sort of a body is it? What does it do? Has it had any results that have had an
important effect on the management of human and /or animal diseases? Its web site gives the
impression of a sleepy organisation just running meetings and not keeping its web site up to date.
The arguments connecting One Health and a possible new UN (or other) organisation with your
survey could be set out less vaguely, with better examples of how a One Health approach could
help. Maybe you could be explicit about some situations where a One Health approach would
clearly help and others where it would not be useful. For instance, could epidemiology help in
managing pine invasions in the fynbos and, if so, how? And conversely, invasion science and
managing AIDS in Cape Town?
The bulk of your paper is the survey of the similarities and differences between epidemiology
and invasion science. Most of it is excellent and would be very useful to both communities. You
put your over-view into a series of figures of a type that I personally don’t find helpful but many
people do. One Health is based on combing the three fields called Human, Animal and
Environmental in Fig 1, but the joint set of those three is empty in fig 1 (apart from an arrow
passing through). In Fig 2 the boundary of Animal is oddly placed. Fig 3 shows a scheme
4
following one devised by Dr Richardson with barriers and there is an assertion that the first
barrier to cross is a geographical one, as it was with WNV. But I would have thought that most
EIDs have first to cross a species barrier, as HIV had to jump from chimpanzee to man or ebola
from fruit bats (maybe) with no geographical barrier involved. Fig 4 gets as far as management
planning with no management action,
Which brings me to the most disappointing section, on p. 9 ‘B) Differences in risk management
methods’ which is a classified reading list not a review and, in particular no results, no examples
of real management. As the obvious difference between EIDs and classical biological invasions is
the way they have to be managed, this is a major gap that should be filled. This section needs to
be greatly expanded.
The other areas that I think are neglected are, as mentioned above, plant pathogens and, quite
different, insect parasitoids whether introduced for biological control or, occasionally, introduced
pests. And maybe other insect parasites such as leaf-miners.
I would hope that such revisions would make a much more compelling case.

Comments to the Author(s)
A position paper/review that compares and contrasts the fields and efforts in the
control of invasive biologicals (plants, insects, others), and those in the control of
emerging infectious diseases. The connections between those fields are still largely
distinct, and populated by different researchers, but they make a good case that
there are many connections in the introduction, initial establishment, emergence
and spread of the two types of invasives. Many of the same skills are used in the
two fields, and in modeling the different steps involved, indicating that the
disciplines can share skills and models. They build this around the so-called One
Health model, which is reasonable, and they include some well thought
out/diagrammatic models of the steps involved in analysis and control of each type
of invasion/emergence. Overall a useful contribution to the fields involved, and it
will be interesting to see if the cooperation between the fields can be accomplished.
RESPONSE: Thank you for these comments
A few issues to consider;
1) They seem to leave out or at least not explicitly include an important component
of the One Health effort - the medical communities (human and veterinary).
Perhaps the invasive studies do not obviously connect up, but the emerging diseases
would do?
RESPONSE: The reviewer is correct that One Health encompasses a very wide range
of disciplines, and human and veterinary medical communities are important ones.
This is now included (Page 3, Lines 64-65 and Page 4 Lines 102-103).
2) A few jargon words that I am not immediately sure of the definition - disservices?
Maybe those can be defined or a glossary included.
RESPONSE: We have defined these in the text (Page 4 Lines 106-108) and checked
that there are not other terms that go undefined in the text.
3) They do not explicitly seem to show how the fields are connected by invasive
vectors (mosquitoes, ticks, others) and that provide a pathway for the diseases that
take advantage of those to spread into new areas.
RESPONSE: We did not emphasise this as it has been the subject of previous
reviews, although we have changed the text somewhat to indicate that this subject
has been particularly identified as directly linking the disciplines (Page 3 Lines 82-
84).
4) The term pre-adaptation is unclear to me, and perhaps not really an accurate
definition of certain mutations. Not sure what is meant by "eco-evolutionary
experience". Mutations arise and selected in an environment, which may favor
spread in another environment - not sure if that is pre-adaptation as it implies some
forshadowing of future selections in other environments?
RESPONSE: The terms pre-adaptation and eco-evolutionary experience have been
widely used in invasion biology and for that reason we include them here. We hope
now that these terms are better explained on Page 6 Lines 195-203.
5) Page 6 - ii) - Compatibility? For disease emergence this would also include
population size, density and connectedness?
RESPONSE: Transmission of infectious diseases clearly depends on the
characteristics of the pathogen (which we term in this article compatibility) and on
the host population characteristics. The latter we include more specifically as the
“environment” for this article (Page 7 Lines 230-231), but we also emphasise that
while we have separated geography, compatibility and environment for
convenience, the reality is that these are often mutually dependent in determining
invasion/emergence (Page 7 Lines 251-254).
6) Page 6 - Would be "as for non-disease-causing invasive..."
RESPONSE: This has been corrected.
7) Page 8 - Not sure that EIDs are typically obligate parasites, or of vertebrates.
Many could be opportunistic; also could equally well emerge in invertebrates (or
plants or prokaryotes)?
RESPONSE: It is an interesting point to think in the wider context of emerging
infectious diseases, and we have included mention of this in the Background (Page
3, Lines 57-62) and in the One Health section in response to reviewer 2 (Page 4 Lines
117-124). However, this article focuses on EIDs of public health significance (Page 3
Lines 56-57). It is true that some EIDs are not obligate parasites of vertebrates (e.g.
Cryptococcus infection, Vibrios), but many EIDs of public health significance are, and
this has driven an industry of modelling studies. To make this clear we have slightly
re-worded this section (Page 8 Lines 285-286).
8) Page 9 - "relatively recently" is cited to a 2001 paper - almost a generation ago.
RESPONSE: We have changed this from “relatively recently” to “more recently’, as
the comparison is with the work in invasion biology which dates from the 1980s
(Page 9 Line 332).
9) Page 9 - determining parameters of the different components of the
emergence/invasion systems would be needed for proper control strategies?
RESPONSE: Yes that is right – thank you and now included (Page 9 Lines 341-343).
10) Page 10 - what is the data showing that funding is "orders of magnitude" less for
invasion studies.
RESPONSE: Indeed this statement based on perception needs supporting, however
obtaining the data is a long process so in the interest of timeliness we have changed
the text here (Page 10, Lines 385-387).
11) Page 10 - why is only the European CDCD cited? Most counties have
organizations with similar responsibilities that might be mobilized? What are the
organizations that address invasive transmission?
RESPONSE: We have slightly changed this to identify a range of public health
organisations in different countries, and to identify the range of organisations that
are responsible for responding to invasive species (Page 11 Lines 416-427).
12) Figure 3 - This is an odd diagram and unclear - perhaps the barriers need to be
extended across the different columns to make it clear what it is showing.
RESPONSE: We hope the modified version of this figure makes it more clear.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The paper you have submitted says, in the title, that it’s a call for closer
collaboration and, on p. 3 line 52, that it’s a review. In p. 3 lines 46-7 you say the
ideas are not new. In my view, your paper is a very useful and thorough survey of
some relevant science. The science is embedded in phrases that say that both
invasionists and epidemiologists ‘require’ (p 12 line 7) a joint One Health approach.
You need to say, both in the title and early on, that the paper is both a call and a
review and to connect the two more clearly.
RESPONSE: Thanks and good idea. One Health is now included in the title and that
this is both a review and a “call” is included in the last paragraph of the background
section.
In particular you need clearer arguments that invasion scientists and
epidemiologists would produce better results than working separately and, also,
why those two disciplines.
REPONSE: We feel that we have built an argument of the basis that i) the two fields
have very similar skillsets and are working in parallel; and ii) have different ways of
working that may be synergistic if put together. We have included what we hope is a
more punchy final statement (Page 12 Lines 495-496).
Are not e.g. socio-economic factors important in the management of EIDs and
invasions? Is there not an organisation and journal called EcoHealth working on
that? See vol 15 part 2, June 2018 for a symposium on EIDs and economics.
RESPONSE: Yes economics is an important tool in developing policies on EIDs,
although that does not mean that using economics as a tool is a One Health
approach. There are many aspects of One Health involving interdisciplinary
collaborations, and encouragement of integration of sciences is provided by journals
such as EcoHealth. However here we are explicitly looking at the integration of
invasion biology and EID epidemiology. We argue that invasions and EIDs are all part
of One Health, but we are not trying to say that integration of invasion biology and
EID epidemiology defines One Health.
Maybe you should also look at EPPO (The European and Mediterranean Plant
Protection Organization) and give more attention to plant diseases.
RESPONSE: We had included the importance of invasions (including infectious
diseases that do not affect humans) indirectly for human health although we now
emphasise this in the revision (Page 4 Lines 117-124).
I think though that the chief weakness is that you don’t say enough about One
Health as an organisation. What sort of a body is it? What does it do? Has it had
any results that have had an important effect on the management of human and /or
animal diseases? Its web site gives the impression of a sleepy organisation just
running meetings and not keeping its web site up to date.
RESPONSE: One Health is not an organisation but an approach to preventing and
responding to infectious diseases and other health issues
(https://www.who.int/features/qa/one-health/en/). There is a voluntary
organisation called the One Health Initiative but this does not define One Health.
We hope that the substantial revisions to the section on One Health makes this
clearer (Page 4 Lines 99-105).
The arguments connecting One Health and a possible new UN (or other)
organisation with your survey could be set out less vaguely, with better examples of
how a One Health approach could help. Maybe you could be explicit about some
situations where a One Health approach would clearly help and others where it
would not be useful. For instance, could epidemiology help in managing pine
invasions in the fynbos and, if so, how? And conversely, invasion science and
managing AIDS in Cape Town?
RESPONSE: This is a good idea and we have now included three examples as
suggested (Page 12 Lines 458-472).
The bulk of your paper is the survey of the similarities and differences between
epidemiology and invasion science. Most of it is excellent and would be very useful
to both communities. You put your over-view into a series of figures of a type that I
personally don’t find helpful but many people do. One Health is based on combing
the three fields called Human, Animal and Environmental in Fig 1, but the joint set
of those three is empty in fig 1 (apart from an arrow passing through).
RESPONSE: The inclusion of the three fields as “circles” within the One Health
concept (indicated by the green circle) is indeed confusing and the dashed circles
have been removed.
In Fig 2 the boundary of Animal is oddly placed.
RESPONSE: This has been slightly changed but the “animal” circle explicitly
surrounds those aspects (borehole drilling and changes in water consumption) that
are affected by livestock production. The legend has been altered to emphasise this.
Fig 3 shows a scheme following one devised by Dr Richardson with barriers and
there is an assertion that the first barrier to cross is a geographical one, as it was
with WNV. But I would have thought that most EIDs have first to cross a species
barrier, as HIV had to jump from chimpanzee to man or ebola from fruit bats
(maybe) with no geographical barrier involved.
RESPONSE: We make the point that pathogens going from a wild animal to humans
may be one of “compatibility” (i.e. the species barrier) that may require genetic
changes that allow the species barrier to be crossed. However, in some cases, such
as Ebola, there is no detectable inter-species barrier of compatibility, there is simply
a barrier of humans coming into contact with infected wildlife, which is essentially a
“geographic” barrier, albeit at a scale much smaller than generally considered by
invasion biologists. We have emphasised this in the section on geographical barriers
(Page 5 Lines 168-169). We have also clarified this in the legend of Fig 3.
Fig 4 gets as far as management planning with no management action, Which brings
me to the most disappointing section, on p. 9 ‘B) Differences in risk management
methods’ which is a classified reading list not a review and, in particular no results,
no examples of real management. As the obvious difference between EIDs and
classical biological invasions is the way they have to be managed, this is a major gap
that should be filled. This section needs to be greatly expanded.
RESPONSE: We agree that the possibility for collaborations on management of
invasions and EIDs is not covered in any detail in our article, but is worthy of much
exploration. We made the point in the text of the original version that it is a subject
of such a wide scope that it would require a dedicated review (Page 10 Lines 347-
348). However, we have expanded the “Differences in risk management methods”
section in response to this criticism (Page 10 Line 344 to Page 11 Line 427).
The other areas that I think are neglected are, as mentioned above, plant pathogens
and, quite different, insect parasitoids whether introduced for biological control or,
occasionally, introduced pests. And maybe other insect parasites such as leaf-
miners.
RESPONSE: The subject of the article is explicitly EIDs of public health significance.
However the reviewer is correct in inferring that techniques used by EID
epidemiologists are highly applicable to studying plant pathogens, insect parasites
of plants and parasitoids and we now make this point in the text and add a
reference (Page 8, Lines 272-274).
I would hope that such revisions would make a much more compelling case.
RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for his/her insightful comments.
Appendix B
Dear Mr Dunn and Prof. Padian,
Many thanks to you and your reviewer for the comments on our article. We have
made the minor changes you requested and hope these are suitable. Many thanks
for helping us with this article and we look forward to seeing it published
Yours sincerely
Nick Ogden
Response to Reviewer 2 comments:
Thank you for your careful responses. I have just a couple of suggestions for
wording. In lines 37 & 38 you say necessary and requires which have a touch of
hype about them which may make people sceptical.
RESPONSE: These have been changed as follows:
“…approaches encompassing all three components are necessary respond to
threats…” has been changed to “…approaches encompassing all three components
are needed to respond to threats…”
“We argue that sustainable development requires explicit consideration of
biological invasions within One Health.” Has been changed to “We argue that for
sustainable development biological invasions should be explicitly considered within
One Health.”
In lines 103, 881 you say actor which, in English English, is almost always someone
on a stage or in a film. Your usage may be commoner in other English speaking
countries but for a London based publication I would suggest participant or agent
(or even colleague or collaborator).
RESPONSE: These have been changed as follows:
For the first (in the “One Health concept” section), “actors” has been changed to
“collaborators.”
For the second (in the legend of Fig 4), “The rows of boxes represent the different
actors in the fields of EIDs and biological invasions” has been changed to “The rows
of boxes represent the different fields of involved in responding EIDs and biological
invasions.”
