This interesting study addresses the susceptibility of several bivalves and one lobster
microstructures under normal and acidified conditions.
It is well written. The experimental setting and the statistical analyses are competent.
The conclusions are interesting and worth being published.
Nevertheless, I have a few concerns with the study, particularly with regards to the introduction
of the lobster cuticle in the study, which biases all conclusions when the whole set of samples is
considered. It shows by far the largest amount of organic matter and this leads to the false idea
that organic content may influence the rate of dissolution, when it is clear that the critical factor is
the extremely labile ACC content. Although this is discussed in the text, this point should be
stressed further.
<u>Detailed comments</u>
Line 44.- A reference is needed for this last statement.
Lines 127.- Fig. 1D is not such good. Should be improved.
Lines 136-137.- Dissolution of organic envelopes at the same rate as the crystals is not evident
from Fig. 1A, B.
Lines 150-151.- This statement is not evident in Table 2. Refer to Suppl. Material Table 2.
Table 2.- I have concerns with some of the values here. Crystal density in, at least crossed lamellar
and composite aragonitic prisms, depends very much on what you consider a crystallite unit is.
From the data provided, I presume that authors have taken into account the size of the prismatic
units in composite prisms and the sizes of 1st order lamellae in crossed lamellar, which the actual
crystallite size may be much smaller: individual fibers in the former and 3rd order lamellae in the
latter. This has to be taken into account. Another issue that strikes me is the low organic content
in Atrina (1.5%). How many analyses have the authors performed to estimate the organic content?
I tend to think that the value is highly underestimated for this microstructure. Finally, lobster
cuticle (calcite and a-chitin) should be changed to calcite and ACC plus a-chitin or alike, to give
an account of how different is this microstructure from the rest.
Lines 213-216.- These conclusions might have to be changed if, as I expect, the amount of organic
matter in Atrina changed to higher values.

The susceptibility of the shells of calcifying marine organisms to mass loss during life is an
important issue given levels of ocean acidification expected by the end of the century, and
controlled experiments such as described here will be an important component of understanding
that phenomenon. This ms is a scholarly treatment of the issues and of past work, and has a good
scope and structure, including the reactions of 7 bivalve species – each typifying a different major
shell microstructural type across aragonite and calcite common to mollusks – and arthropod
cuticle, which is less heavily calcified but typical of crustacean shellfish. Both current and
‘reduced pH’ conditions are considered, using standard methods of measuring shell mass loss
(change in thickness) after exposure to natural seawater charged with pCO2 to acidify it to target
levels. I was concerned that the methods included sterilizing that SW (with UV), significantly
altering conditions from natural ones by eliminating a major factor in shell disintegration via
microbial maceration of the shell’s organic matrix. Both Harper (2000) and Glover & Kidwell
(1993), both cited here, tested explicitly the effects of sterilizing seawater on shell persistence, and
found significantly lower loss rates (and different patterns of microstructural deterioration) than
when using fully natural, ‘microbially active’ SW. I think the narrow, sterile conditions of these
new experiments has in fact undercut the broader value of the results, where very little of the
variation in observed loss rates could be explained by the variables considered. I must say also
that none of the authors’ ‘after’ photos resembled SEM-resolution damage that I’ve observed on
shells drawn from modern seabeds, even high-latitude seabeds subject to low-saturated overlying
water – the experimentally produced damage here only resembles lab-induced dissolution under
sterile conditions. A comment within the discussion acknowledges this discrepancy, referring to
pers obs of intense endolithic algae in nacre from natural seawater (the refs above could also be
cited). The experimentally generated damage is thus worrisome, including the observation that
organic matrix retreated to the same degree as the mineral phase in their experimental blocks –
that is as hard to explain as is the low power of shell attributes to explain variation in shell loss.
Overall -- Despite extensive attention to calcifiers under OA conditions, little work has actually
been done on microstructural consequences for the carbonate skeleton itself, and so the paper
remains a valuable and publishable contribution despite my concerns RE set up – it is internally
consistent, well documented, and robust. It should, however, be strengthened by clarifying the
limitations of the experimental conditions – a paragraph in the discussion is needed. Some
reasoning for the choice to sterilize the mesocosm would be helpful to other investigators – was it
to reduce the variables, or necessary to protect equipment?

Appendix A
Response to reviewers’ comments
We are very grateful for the constructive and kind reviews provided by the two anonymous reviewers
of our manuscript. The comments are encouraging and we have sought to respond to them with
revisions and clarifications. Please see below, in blue, our detailed response to the comments.
Reviewer 1:
This interesting study addresses the susceptibility of several bivalves and one lobster microstructures
under normal and acidified conditions. It is well written. The experimental setting and the statistical
analyses are competent. The conclusions are interesting and worth being published.
Nevertheless, I have a few concerns with the study, particularly with regards to the introduction of
the lobster cuticle in the study, which biases all conclusions when the whole set of samples is
considered. It shows by far the largest amount of organic matter and this leads to the false idea that
organic content may influence the rate of dissolution, when it is clear that the critical factor is the
extremely labile ACC content. Although this is discussed in the text, this point should be stressed
further.
We have added clarification (lines 212-214) to reiterate the importance of ACC rather than organic
content in the lobster cuticle. We have also stressed that the bivalves show the same trend between
organic content and dissolution.
“The high dissolution of the lobster cuticle may be related to its ACC content rather than its organic
content. However, the bivalve microstructures, with nacre excluded, also show a significant positive
correlation (p<<0.01) between organic content and dissolution.”
Detailed comments
Line 44.- A reference is needed for this last statement.
Taylor & Layman 1972 has now been added.
Lines 127.- Fig. 1D is not such good. Should be improved.
The post dissolution SEM photo has been replaced with one that more clearly shows the dissolution
of the prisms.
Lines 136-137.- Dissolution of organic envelopes at the same rate as the crystals is not evident from
Fig. 1A, B.
We have added a sentence of clarification (lines 142-144) to the main text which explicitly refers to
what the reader should see, and take away from, Figures 1A and 1B.
Lines 150-151.- This statement is not evident in Table 2. Refer to Suppl. Material Table 2.
This reference has been updated.
Table 2.- I have concerns with some of the values here. Crystal density in, at least crossed lamellar and
composite aragonitic prisms, depends very much on what you consider a crystallite unit is. From the
data provided, I presume that authors have taken into account the size of the prismatic units in
composite prisms and the sizes of 1st order lamellae in crossed lamellar, which the actual crystallite
size may be much smaller: individual fibers in the former and 3rd order lamellae in the latter. This has
to be taken into account.
For assessing the risk from OA we suggest that the complete composite prisms and the 1st order
lamellae are the fundamental blocks that will experience dissolution along their perimeters. However,
we appreciate that this decision requires clarification and have added an explanation for these two
microstructures, with accompanying references, to the methodology (lines 91-94).
Another issue that strikes me is the low organic content in Atrina (1.5%). How many analyses have the
authors performed to estimate the organic content? I tend to think that the value is highly
underestimated for this microstructure.
For the organic content of each microstructure 4 analyses were performed using Thermogravimetric
Analysis. The Atrina returned values of 1.46, 1.59, 1.35, 1.51 which are all consistently around 1.5%.
This value is also not substantially less than values in the published literature (e.g. Harper 2000).
Consequently, we have revised Table 2 so that the number of analyses for each microstructural
characteristic is made clear.
Finally, lobster cuticle (calcite and a-chitin) should be changed to calcite and ACC plus a-chitin or alike,
to give an account of how different is this microstructure from the rest.
This has been corrected.
Lines 213-216.- These conclusions might have to be changed if, as I expect, the amount of organic
matter in Atrina changed to higher values.
If we changed the Atrina organic content to the slightly higher values cited in the literature (˜1.8%) it
doesn’t change the overall conclusions or the outlier nature of the nacre organic content.
Reviewer 2:
The susceptibility of the shells of calcifying marine organisms to mass loss during life is an important

that I’ve observed on shells drawn from modern seabeds, even high-latitude seabeds subject to low-
saturated overlying water – the experimentally produced damage here only resembles lab-induced
dissolution under sterile conditions. A comment within the discussion acknowledges this discrepancy,
referring to pers obs of intense endolithic algae in nacre from natural seawater (the refs above could
also be cited). The experimentally generated damage is thus worrisome, including the observation
that organic matrix retreated to the same degree as the mineral phase in their experimental blocks –
that is as hard to explain as is the low power of shell attributes to explain variation in shell loss.
We thank the reviewer for their kind comments on the manuscript. We acknowledge the importance
of making clear the limitations of our experimental setup and have sought to clarify this in lines 221-
228. The ‘sterilisation’ technique employed results only in a partial sterilisation of the water, but
enough to make sure that the material in the exposure mesocosm is not ‘overwhelmed’ by bacterial
growth over an exposure period of weeks and months. There was substantial evidence from the
samples, and from background measurements made when the mesocosm was used for testing live
invertebrates (J.I. Spicer, unpublished observations) that the mesocosm was not actually fully sterile.
We have therefore argued that whilst the non-natural conditions are an important caveat (although
not sterilizing the water also results in non-natural conditions, i.e. dominance of microbes in the
system) they don’t substantially affect our conclusions.
“The mesocosm seawater is not fully ‘natural’ due to the sterilisation and filtering in the experimental
setup. However, the partial sterilisation is necessary to keep overproliferation of microbial life from
occurring over exposure periods of weeks and months. The presence of biofilms and endolithic algae
boring on the post-dissolution samples (personal observation) indicates that the conditions were not
completely sterile. In unsterilized seawater, with a higher microbe activity, high organic contents would
be expected to further promote dissolution than in sterile conditions. Therefore, whilst the conditions
within the mesocosm are an important consideration, our conclusions are still expected to be a faithful,
if possibly conservative, representation of ‘natural’ seawater conditions.”
Overall -- Despite extensive attention to calcifiers under OA conditions, little work has actually been
done on microstructural consequences for the carbonate skeleton itself, and so the paper remains a
valuable and publishable contribution despite my concerns RE set up – it is internally consistent, well
documented, and robust. It should, however, be strengthened by clarifying the limitations of the
experimental conditions – a paragraph in the discussion is needed. Some reasoning for the choice to
sterilize the mesocosm would be helpful to other investigators – was it to reduce the variables, or
necessary to protect equipment?
We have added a sentence to the methodology (lines 113-114) to explain that the partial sterilisation
and filtering are required to prevent the overproliferation of microbial life which has been observed
to occur in the mesocosm otherwise. The same experimental setup is used to investigate the effect of
OA and warming on living organisms, and without the partial sterilisation, there is significant
accumulation of microbial life, and a greater prevalence of disease in the test subjects.
