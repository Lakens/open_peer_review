Review of RSOS-171456 “An overlooked plant-parakeet mutualism counteracts human
overharvesting on an endangered tree” by Karina Speziale et al. submitted for possible
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
The authors investigated the possible role of Austral parakeets (Enicognathus ferrugineus) in
providing seeds of Araucaria araucana an escape from humans. Humans harvest seeds for food
or trade, competing with the parakeets by the seeds. The exploitation of seeds by humans
decrease natural seed abundance and possibly decrease the likelihood of plant recruitment. In
spite parakeets are also seed predators, some seeds are only partially eaten and may rely beneath
the mother plants or are carried away before dropped to the ground. Humans avoid harvesting
those damaged seeds, but they are still able to germinate as demonstrated by authors. Thus, it is
possible that apparent competition between parakeets and humans benefit tree regeneration.
General comments
Introduction
Line 64: As stated in the first paragraph of the Introduction, plant-animal interactions are
complex and often give unexpected outcomes. I would not say that seed dispersal was “fully
described” in the refs indicated. Please check.
I suggest the authors to have a look on the ms by Carlos Peres and co-authors about the possible
impacts of overexploitation of Brazil-nut tree seeds for plant population persistence and long-
term sustainability of seed harvesting in the Amazon (Peres et al. 2003. Demographic threats to
the sustainability of Brazil nut exploitation. Science 302: 2112-2114). Although developed in
another region this study has several points in common with the current ms. Also, is it possible
that seed harvesting by humans decreases seed density and thus enhances seed survival through
relaxing negative-density dependent effects for recruitment?
To illustrate the complexity of biological interactions and how unexpected actors may impact
plant recruitment please consider the following reference Camargo et al. 2016. Bird and ant
synergy increases the dispersal effectiveness of a tropical shrub. Oecologia 181: 507-518. The ms
brings an schematic representation of transition probabilities from subsequent early stages of
plant regeneration, and how the interaction with different vectors influence the likelihood of
survival and regeneration. Since you have estimates for several trees (production, harvest,
predation, survival and germination) consider apply this approach to evaluate the contribution of
parakeets for plant regeneration.
Line 43: Reference 6 is a very nice work, but I feel it does not fit here very well. Please check.
Line 60-63: The tolerance to damage and subsequent capacity of germination is more common for
large seeds. For instance see Mack AL 1998. An advantage of large seed size: Tolerating rather
than succumbing to seed predators. Biotropica 30: 604-608. Thus, plants producing large seeds (as
Araucaria) are more likely to benefit from partial predation than plants producing comparatively
smaller seeds (see your discussion).
Paragraph in lines 64-72: I feel this paragraph is a bit disconnected from the rest of the ms. You
can discuss the potential effectiveness of dispersal by birds and humans in your system, but you
3
did not recover this approach in your discussion. At the same time you are not testing the Janzen-
Connell model, and even recognize that plant regeneration is common beneath mother trees (see
line 127-128 and 159-163).
Lines 95-97: Is there any evidence that humans, apart from seed harvesting, also have enhanced
the regeneration of this tree in some patches? It is suspected that the spatial distribution and
regeneration of several tree species were changed by human exploitation, not only by negative
effects (see Levis et al. 2017 Persistent effects of pre-Columbian plant domestication on
Amazonian forest composition. Science, 2017; 355 (6328): 925 DOI: 10.1126/science.aal0157). At
least humans may behave in a way similar to parrots that accidentally drop some seeds away
from plants and provide dispersal. A measure of this potential effect or a comment based on
existing information seems worthwhile.
Line 109-116 in Introduction is virtually the same in Materials and Methods (lines 171-180). Please
check.
Field sampling: Please provide sample sizes for the number of people interviewed and from
whose seed samples were obtained (lines 190-195). In Results (line 243) you indicated “10
groups” but I do not know if you analyzed data by groups or by each individual person.
Please make it clear if you have two treatment sites (with seed harvesting by humans) and two
control sites (lines 187-190) or three treatment and only one control site (lines 199-202 and also
Figure 2). This has many implications for the results and discussion of the study.
Line 153-155: I could not check the ref 29 (which is incomplete in the ref section). Are there any
other sources of evidence that rodents do not disperse seeds in no masting years? In the
congeneric Araucaria angustifolia rodents are an important source of seed predation, but also
dispersers (for instance please see Iob G & Vieira EM. 2008.Seed predation of Araucaria
angustifolia (Araucariaceae) in the Brazilian Araucaria Forest: influence of deposition site and
comparative role of small and 'large' mammals. Plant Ecology 198: 185-196, and references
therein.
Line 205-206: Please indicate how did you chose the seeds for germination testing and from how
many trees they came from (line 205-206).
Discussion
Please have a look on the article of Peres CA et al. 2003 already indicated above.
Lines 270-272: See also Blanco et al. 2016 Internal seed dispersal by parrots: An overview of a
neglected mutualism. PeerJ 4:e1688 (already cited in ms) and references therein.
Lines 311-313: The recognition that large seeds may be more resistant to damage by seed
predators is recognized in previous experiments (for instance see Lack 1998 above and references
therein). Please consider rewrite.
Are there any initiatives from seed harvesters in nursering seedlings and juveniles of Araucaria
and producing a positive influence in plant regeneration in the long term?

What do the authors mean by ‘significant’ germination? This should be stated, the readers need

Methods
by throwing 10 times a 40x50-cm frame in random directions within the area projected by the
crown of each of the sampled trees, and counting each time the number of intact and partially
predated seeds within the area delimited by the frame – Were the directions really randomly
selected? Or the authors simply throw the frame without particularly selecting the placement
area?
5
We considered as partially predated seeds those with less than 50% of the seed predated
There is not such a thing as partially predated. The authors should revise that, indicating that
they are considering partially damaged seeds
We calculated the germination rate of three different seed types (with 50 replicates each): (1)
intact seeds, (2) seeds partially eaten by parakeets, and (3) seeds in which we simulated the effect
of parakeet partial predation by manually cutting the distal portion of the seed in similar
proportions as those munched by parakeets.
Did the authors use seeds from how many individuals? This is not stated in the methods.
In the data analysis section the authors indicated that they include ‘tree” as a random term to
account for any potential maternal effect in seed quality, which is good. But anyway, the number
of trees used in the experiment should be stated.

another region this study has several points in common with the current ms. Also, is it possible
that seed harvesting by humans decreases seed density and thus enhances seed survival through
relaxing negative-density dependent effects for recruitment?
To illustrate the complexity of biological interactions and how unexpected actors may impact
plant recruitment please consider the following reference Camargo et al. 2016. Bird and ant

brings an schematic representation of transition probabilities from subsequent early stages of
plant regeneration, and how the interaction with different vectors influence the likelihood of
survival and regeneration. Since you have estimates for several trees (production, harvest,
predation, survival and germination) consider apply this approach to evaluate the contribution of
parakeets for plant regeneration.
Line 43: Reference 6 is a very nice work, but I feel it does not fit here very well. Please check.
Line 60-63: The tolerance to damage and subsequent capacity of germination is more common for
large seeds. For instance see Mack AL 1998. An advantage of large seed size: Tolerating rather

Araucaria) are more likely to benefit from partial predation than plants producing comparatively
smaller seeds (see your discussion).
Paragraph in lines 64-72: I feel this paragraph is a bit disconnected from the rest of the ms. You

did not recover this approach in your discussion. At the same time you are not testing the Janzen-

Please make it clear if you have two treatment sites (with seed harvesting by humans) and two

label_comment_3
This is a clearly improved version of the ms compared to the original submission. The authors
have done a good job in improving its clarity and readability, and inserting their ms in a broader
focus.
Below I am inserting some minor points that, I believe, may further help the authors to improve
the clarity and readability of their ms.
Page and line numbers as printed in pdf
Page 6, line 107-109: Replace "k" by "kg". Kg is the standard unit of weight measure. Also indicate
what is the currency used (US$? Pesos?)
Page 7 lines 149-150: Please indicate what are you considering as a "long distance" dispersal. This
is always a matter of conflict among studies. A brief check in ref 27 cited in the ms indicated that
some rodents may remove seeds farther than 40 m, which seems impressive. You probably have
some estimations about distances of seed removal by parakeets. Just let your reader know what
are the scale you consider as "long distance".
Lines 150-153: Consider break sentence in two different ones to improve clarity and readability.
11
Lines 238-239: Consider the possibility to rephrase here. For example "... SDE (41) to provide
estimates of seedling recruitment in four scenarios..." When talking about SDE consider also the
original article suggesting the use of this approach to evaluate dispersal suscess (e.g. Schupp et al.
2010 Seed dispersal effectiveness revisited: a conceptual review. New Phytol 188: 333-353)
Please include some comments about the expectations of SDE outcomes with/without parakeets
and with/without human harvesting of seeds in your introduction (lines 128-134).
Please rephrase sentences in lines 288-291 to clarify your argument to the reader. The increase in
SDE (which is a nice result) occurs only in sites under heavy harvesting by humans.
Lines 291-294: Rephrase sentences to make clear your argument. I suggest you to break sentence
in two. Avoid also the use of "them", as you have parakeets and seeds in same sentence.
Lines 328-330: "Mapuche-Pewenche people have traditionally included A. araucana seeds in their
diet without compromising the species regeneration." To me this sentence seems in contradiction
with some of the main arguments of the text. If plant regeneration is seed limited it is likely that
seed harvesting limits plant regeneration. The argument that parakeets may increase regeneration
by reducing harvesting of partially damaged seeds agree with this and it is the core of the article.
Probably the authors may have some other evidence in this respect (that indigenous people
harvest do not threat the species) but the way you are communicating this here seems in
contradiction with your argument developed before. Maybe a reference here would help. Or
consider rephrase. It would be interesting to listen if indigenous people also avoid harvesting
partially damaged seeds, as this would provide a more long term perspective (from the past) of
the output of parakeet-plant-human interaction.
Fig 1. I have seen that the authors replaced Fig 1a with a human seed collector by the parakeet. I
agree with the change, as the image of the seed collector could potentially bring him in trouble
due to illegal harvesting activities. Fig 1b is very nice and does not allow recognition of
individual people, which seems good. Legend of Fig 1b could stop at "collecting seeds", as more
details are provided in the text.
Fig. 2: make clear to the reader that "N" refers to the number of trees sampled in each site.
I wish the authors the best of luck in the publication of their paper.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a clearly improved version of the ms compared to the original submission. The authors
have done a good job in improving its clarity and readability, and inserting their ms in a broader
focus.
Below I am inserting some minor points that, I believe, may further help the authors to improve
the clarity and readability of their ms.
Page and line numbers as printed in pdf
Page 6, line 107-109: Replace "k" by "kg". Kg is the standard unit of weight measure. Also indicate
what is the currency used (US$? Pesos?)
Page 7 lines 149-150: Please indicate what are you considering as a "long distance" dispersal. This
is always a matter of conflict among studies. A brief check in ref 27 cited in the ms indicated that
some rodents may remove seeds farther than 40 m, which seems impressive. You probably have
some estimations about distances of seed removal by parakeets. Just let your reader know what
are the scale you consider as "long distance".
Lines 150-153: Consider break sentence in two different ones to improve clarity and readability.
Lines 238-239: Consider the possibility to rephrase here. For example "... SDE (41) to provide
estimates of seedling recruitment in four scenarios..." When talking about SDE consider also the
original article suggesting the use of this approach to evaluate dispersal suscess (e.g. Schupp et al.
2010 Seed dispersal effectiveness revisited: a conceptual review. New Phytol 188: 333-353)
Please include some comments about the expectations of SDE outcomes with/without parakeets
and with/without human harvesting of seeds in your introduction (lines 128-134).
Please rephrase sentences in lines 288-291 to clarify your argument to the reader. The increase in
SDE (which is a nice result) occurs only in sites under heavy harvesting by humans.
15
Lines 291-294: Rephrase sentences to make clear your argument. I suggest you to break sentence
in two. Avoid also the use of "them", as you have parakeets and seeds in same sentence.
Lines 328-330: "Mapuche-Pewenche people have traditionally included A. araucana seeds in their
diet without compromising the species regeneration." To me this sentence seems in contradiction
with some of the main arguments of the text. If plant regeneration is seed limited it is likely that
seed harvesting limits plant regeneration. The argument that parakeets may increase regeneration
by reducing harvesting of partially damaged seeds agree with this and it is the core of the article.
Probably the authors may have some other evidence in this respect (that indigenous people
harvest do not threat the species) but the way you are communicating this here seems in
contradiction with your argument developed before. Maybe a reference here would help. Or
consider rephrase. It would be interesting to listen if indigenous people also avoid harvesting
partially damaged seeds, as this would provide a more long term perspective (from the past) of
the output of parakeet-plant-human interaction.
Fig 1. I have seen that the authors replaced Fig 1a with a human seed collector by the parakeet. I
agree with the change, as the image of the seed collector could potentially bring him in trouble
due to illegal harvesting activities. Fig 1b is very nice and does not allow recognition of
individual people, which seems good. Legend of Fig 1b could stop at "collecting seeds", as more
details are provided in the text.
Fig. 2: make clear to the reader that "N" refers to the number of trees sampled in each site.
I wish the authors the best of luck in the publication of their paper.

Appendix A
Dear Alice Power and Kevin Padian
Editor Coordinator and Subject Editor
Royal Society Open Science
Thank you for the comments on our manuscript RSOS-171456 entitled ‘An overlooked plant-
parakeet mutualism counteracts human overharvesting on an endangered tree’. We really
appreciate your and the referee’s feedback. The comments helped us to significantly improve
the manuscript. We are now re-submitting a new version after revising it in line with the
comments. In this response letter we include the referees’ comments followed by our answers.
We will be happy to answer any further query or information you request.
Sincerely,
Karina Speziale (on behalf of the co-authors)
In revising the MS, we have considered each of the Reviewers’ comments to the detail and
provide the following responses:
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
General comments
Introduction
Line 64: As stated in the first paragraph of the Introduction, plant-animal interactions are
complex and often give unexpected outcomes. I would not say that seed dispersal was “fully
described” in the refs indicated. Please check.
Response: The paragraph in which this sentence was included has been removed in the new
version of our MS (see comment below).
I suggest the authors to have a look on the ms by Carlos Peres and co-authors about the
possible impacts of overexploitation of Brazil-nut tree seeds for plant population persistence
and long-term sustainability of seed harvesting in the Amazon (Peres et al. 2003. Demographic
threats to the sustainability of Brazil nut exploitation. Science 302: 2112-2114). Although
developed in another region this study has several points in common with the current ms.
Also, is it possible that seed harvesting by humans decreases seed density and thus enhances
seed survival through relaxing negative-density dependent effects for recruitment?
Response: We have read and included the reference suggested by this reviewer in the
introduction to support our hypothesis (lines 122-124) as follows:
“Human seed collection may impact female fitness negatively because it reduces both
potential regeneration under seed-producing trees [20,25,26] and...”. We also included this
reference in the Discussion as suggested (lines 354-355).
In relation to the second idea, we have considered the possibility of humans relaxing the
negative-density dependent effects of seed density on recruitment, but given we studied
germination potential we do not think it could be a limitation as seeds germinate due to
their own reserves. Moreover, given the lack of information on this type of effects for the
species and the very low density of seeds remaining within areas subject to human seed
collection, we do not consider that human seed collection can have a positive effect in the
study area.
To illustrate the complexity of biological interactions and how unexpected actors may impact
plant recruitment please consider the following reference Camargo et al. 2016. Bird and ant
synergy increases the dispersal effectiveness of a tropical shrub. Oecologia 181: 507-518. The
ms brings a schematic representation of transition probabilities from subsequent early stages
of plant regeneration, and how the interaction with different vectors influence the likelihood
of survival and regeneration. Since you have estimates for several trees (production, harvest,
predation, survival and germination) consider apply this approach to evaluate the contribution
of parakeets for plant regeneration.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We did evaluate the interesting approach proposed
by the Referee, and concluded that the data we count on plus the data available in the
bibliography is not enough to conduct an analysis as the one developed in that paper.
Unfortunately, we did not measure tree productivity (only the density of seeds after human
collection); seeds found on the ground may have fallen due to barochory or by parakeets’
activity, but we cannot disentangle between the two mechanisms. Also, we did not measure
parakeets’ predation of complete seeds (only partial consumption), secondary dispersal or
the proportion of seeds turning seedlings in the field.
However, we did measure the proportion of seeds partially predated by parakeets and their
germination success. Therefore, following the referee’s recommendations, in this new
version of the manuscript we calculated the effective seed dispersal in a comparative way
(control site vs sites with human collection considering both intact and partially consumed
seeds) to highlight the potential rescue effect based on seeds already primarily dispersed
with the data we collected. The analyses and limitation of our estimations has been clearly
stated (see lines 238-253) in the following way: “We then compared A. araucana seed
dispersal efficiency (SDE) [41], and index that provides a maximum estimate of seedling
recruitment, for four scenarios: 1) intact seeds in control area (without human seed
collection), 2) partially consumed seeds in control area 3) intact seeds in areas subject to
human collection, and 4) partially consumed seeds plus intact seeds in areas subject to
human collection. We measured this SDE index only for the seeds primarily dispersed by
barochory or by parakeets under maternal trees. Given that we did not quantify the
proportion of germinated seeds turning into saplings we could only estimate SDE by
considering germination potential of primarily dispersed seeds (i.e. not considering long
distance dispersal by parakeets [21]). As a consequence, this index was estimated by
multiplying the median seed density found under trees in each scenario (a quantitative
component of dispersal) by the germination potential of intact or partially consumed seeds
obtained from our previous results (a qualitative component of dispersal [42]). We expected
that SDE of partially consumed seeds will not contribute to increase total SDE significantly in
control areas. On the other hand, its contribution to total seedling recruitment would be
significant in areas subject to human seed collection given that SDE of intact seeds in this
area would be very low.”
We have included the results of this analysis (lines 274-279) as follows: “Given the median
seeds/m2 and germination success shown above, the SDE was 5.88 seedlings/m2 in control
areas, 0.56 seedlings/m2 in control areas for partially consumed seeds, 0.7 seedlings/m2 for
intact seeds in areas subject to human collection, and 1.26 seedlings/m2 when considering
the combined effect of intact and partially damaged seeds in areas subject to human
collection. Thus, in areas with high seed collection by humans SDE was almost 80% higher
when partially damaged seeds are included.”
Additionally, we projected Araucaria population based on matrix analyses. For this we
analyzed the impact of the increment in the SDE for Araucaria araucana forest regeneration
for populations subject to human seed collection. We used our data on germination success
and density of seeds together with data for saplings’ and adults’ survival of a
phylogenetically related Araucaria species (Araucaria hunsteinii) as no data exists for
Araucaria araucana. The results of these models showed that this important increment in
SDE given by seeds partially consumed by parakeets improved Araucaria forest regeneration
in the long term as we expected. However, we prefer to be conservative on this given we
have no data for our study species. Thus, we consider it better not to include those results as
being too speculative.
We thank the referee for these recommendations that improved the implications of the
article.
Line 43: Reference 6 is a very nice work, but I feel it does not fit here very well. Please check.
Response: we have removed it.
Line 60-63: The tolerance to damage and subsequent capacity of germination is more common
for large seeds. For instance see Mack AL 1998. An advantage of large seed size: Tolerating
rather than succumbing to seed predators. Biotropica 30: 604-608. Thus, plants producing
large seeds (as Araucaria) are more likely to benefit from partial predation than plants
producing comparatively smaller seeds (see your discussion).
Response: Thank you for the important suggestion. We had not seen that important work
before. We have included this reference(lines 64-65 ) as follows: “Large seeds may be more
resistant to damage by seed consumers as they may retain germination potential after being
damaged [15].”
Paragraph in lines 64-72: I feel this paragraph is a bit disconnected from the rest of the ms. You
can discuss the potential effectiveness of dispersal by birds and humans in your system, but
you did not recover this approach in your discussion. At the same time you are not testing the
Janzen-Connell model, and even recognize that plant regeneration is common beneath mother
trees (see line 127-128 and 159-163).
Response: We understand the referee’s point and thus we have removed this paragraph
from the revision.
Lines 95-97: Is there any evidence that humans, apart from seed harvesting, also have
enhanced the regeneration of this tree in some patches? It is suspected that the spatial
distribution and regeneration of several tree species were changed by human exploitation, not
only by negative effects (see Levis et al. 2017 Persistent effects of pre-Columbian plant
domestication on Amazonian forest composition. Science, 2017; 355 (6328): 925 DOI:
10.1126/science.aal0157). At least humans may behave in a way similar to parrots that
accidentally drop some seeds away from plants and provide dispersal. A measure of this
potential effect or a comment based on existing information seems worthwhile.
Response: Thank you for comment. Yes, there is some information suggesting the possibility
of human-mediated dispersal; we have now included a reference to this topic in the
discussion. Please, see below.
Line 109-116 in Introduction is virtually the same in Materials and Methods (lines 171-180).
Please check.
Response: Thank you for highlighting the mistake. We have removed the sentences from
lines 171-180.
Field sampling: Please provide sample sizes for the number of people interviewed and from
whose seed samples were obtained (lines 190-195). In Results (line 245) you indicated “10
groups” but I do not know if you analyzed data by groups or by each individual person.
Response: We analysed data by groups, we have clarified it in the materials and results
sections in lines 185 and 255.
Please make it clear if you have two treatment sites (with seed harvesting by humans) and two
control sites (lines 187-190) or three treatment and only one control site (lines 199-202 and
also Figure 2). This has many implications for the results and discussion of the study.
Response: We are sorry for the mistake. There are three patches subject to anthropogenic
seed collection and one control area. We corrected the mistake in lines 181-184: “Three of
these patches were subject to anthropogenic seed collection while the remaining,
experiencing no collection because of being close to the park ranger station and customs
office, was used as control.”
Line 153-155: I could not check the ref 29 (which is incomplete in the ref section). Are there
any other sources of evidence that rodents do not disperse seeds in no masting years? In the
congeneric Araucaria angustifolia rodents are an important source of seed predation, but also
dispersers (for instance please see Iob G & Vieira EM. 2008.Seed predation of Araucaria
angustifolia (Araucariaceae) in the Brazilian Araucaria Forest: influence of deposition site and
comparative role of small and 'large' mammals. Plant Ecology 198: 185-196, and references
therein.
Response: We have included the volume and number of pages for the reference. We have
also checked all the references cited in this manuscript. We have re-phrased the sentence
including more data from the manuscript cited to support the low contribution of rodent to
potential seed dispersal and germination as follows (see lines 149-153): “Large distance
dispersal is performed by Austral parakeets [21] and rodents. However, only one mice
species (Abrothrix longipilis) deposits seeds in potential good places for germination,
although germination normally occurs when seed are on top soil while this rodent bury them
under soil or leaf litter between 7 and 9.4 cm deep [27].”
Line 205-206: Please indicate how did you chose the seeds for germination testing and from
how many trees they came from (line 205-206).
Response: We included this information to clarify the topic as follows (lines 210-211): “We
randomly selected the seeds from the seed pool collected under 22 seed-producing trees.”
Discussion
Please have a look on the article of Peres CA et al. 2003 already indicated above.
Response: We have read the article and included it in the following way in lines 355-358:
“Also, the study and monitoring of the sustainability of human collection merit special
attention, to better predict its impact on Araucaria forests regeneration potential and to
provide scientific means to regulate harvesting as it is suggested for other tree species in
South America [26]”.
Lines 270-272: See also Blanco et al. 2016 Internal seed dispersal by parrots: An overview of a
neglected mutualism. PeerJ 4:e1688 (already cited in ms) and references therein.
Response: thank you for the suggestion. We included this reference as well as three articles
recently published by some of our coauthors that are relevant to this topic:

mutualism–antagonism continuums increases community robustness. Nat. Ecol. Evol. 1,

dispersal by macaws shapes the landscape of an Amazonian ecosystem. Scientific Reports 7,
7373.
Lines 311-313: The recognition that large seeds may be more resistant to damage by seed
predators is recognized in previous experiments (for instance see Lack 1998 above and
references therein). Please consider rewrite.
Response: we thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We re-phrased the sentence as follows
(lines 343-346): “In particular, the potential germination of partially-eaten seeds has been
rarely addressed [15,46,53,54], and, to our knowledge, partial seed predation never
considered as a possible mechanism rescuing wild plant populations subjected to human
exploitation”.
Are there any initiatives from seed harvesters in nursering seedlings and juveniles of Araucaria
and producing a positive influence in plant regeneration in the long term?
Response: We have found this kind of initiatives in Chile. Despite our intensive search we did
not find similar initiatives in Argentina. We have included the reference to Chile in lines 354-
355 as follows: “. Restoration initiatives are taking place in Chile, where Mapuche
communities are planting seeds and nursering seedlings [28].”
Legend Figure 2,3: Please give sample sizes.
Response: We have clarified sample sizes in lines 543-544 and 551.
Please give information about abbreviations used in suppl. data file
Response: We have now included them. Thank you for the suggestion.
Minor points
Line 190: were used as controls.
Response: Thank you for the comment. We made no change given it was an error you
highlighted before. As we corrected the mistake there is no need to change this now.
Line 109: “Last year” – better replace with date (year). Which government, Chilean or
Argentinian?
Response: We corrected it as follows: “In 2016, by resolution 042/16, the government of
Neuquén province in Argentina allowed a collection rate up to 20 k/ person and 100 k/
family for personal consumption after obtaining a permit that costed 0.35$/k.”
Please double check reference list. Several of them are incomplete (for instance ref. 19, 29, 34,
36, 37,…. ).
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have fully revised the list.
I wish the best luck to the authors in publishing their ms.

Comments to the Author(s)
My specific comments on the manuscript are listed below
Speficic comments
Line 85 secondary dispersal after seed are primarily dispersed by barochory. A recent study. –
after seeds
Response: thank you for pointing out the error. We have now added the “s”.
Line 136-137 … retain significant germination potential
What do the authors mean by ‘significant’ germination? This should be stated, the readers
need to know how their hypothesis would be falsified
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have removed the word “significant” to clarify
that we hypothesise that seeds damaged by parakeets will still germinate.
Methods
by throwing 10 times a 40x50-cm frame in random directions within the area projected by the
crown of each of the sampled trees, and counting each time the number of intact and partially
predated seeds within the area delimited by the frame – Were the directions really randomly
selected? Or the authors simply throw the frame without particularly selecting the placement
area?
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have clarified the point in lines 191-194 as
follows: “We estimated seed density by haphazardly throwing 10 times a 40x50-cm frame
within the area projected by the crown of each of the sampled trees, and counting each time
the number of intact and partially damaged seeds within the area delimited by the frame.”
We considered as partially predated seeds those with less than 50% of the seed predated
There is not such a thing as partially predated. The authors should revise that, indicating that
they are considering partially damaged seeds
Response: thank you for the comment. We changed predated by damaged or other
convenient word as suggested all through the manuscript.
We calculated the germination rate of three different seed types (with 50 replicates each): (1)
intact seeds, (2) seeds partially eaten by parakeets, and (3) seeds in which we simulated the
effect of parakeet partial predation by manually cutting the distal portion of the seed in similar
proportions as those munched by parakeets.
Did the authors use seeds from how many individuals? This is not stated in the methods.
In the data analysis section the authors indicated that they include ‘tree” as a random term to
account for any potential maternal effect in seed quality, which is good. But anyway, the
number of trees used in the experiment should be stated.
Response: Thank you for the comment which was also stated by Reviewer 1. We included a
sentence to clarify the topic suggested in lines 210-211: “We randomly selected the seeds
from the seed pool collected under 22 of the sampled trees.”

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a clearly improved version of the ms compared to the original submission. The authors have done
a good job in improving its clarity and readability, and inserting their ms in a broader focus.
Below I am inserting some minor points that, I believe, may further help the authors to improve the
clarity and readability of their ms. Page and line numbers as printed in pdf
R: We thank the reviewer for the comments. We have included all the suggestions as we state below:
Page 6, line 107-109: Replace "k" by "kg". Kg is the standard unit of weight measure. Also indicate what
is the currency used (US$? Pesos?)
R: thank you for pointing at the mistake. We changed k to kg as indicated and clarify that dollar (US$) is
the currency.
Page 7 lines 149-150: Please indicate what are you considering as a "long distance" dispersal. This is
always a matter of conflict among studies. A brief check in ref 27 cited in the ms indicated that some
rodents may remove seeds farther than 40 m, which seems impressive. You probably have some
estimations about distances of seed removal by parakeets. Just let your reader know what are the scale
you consider as "long distance".
R: we have included what each reference indicates as long distance dispersal as suggested in the
following way:
“Large distance dispersal is performed by Austral parakeets up to at least 50m, but most probably to
longer distances [21], and rodents up to 40m [27].”
Lines 150-153: Consider break sentence in two different ones to improve clarity and readability.
R: We broke the sentence in the following way in lines 151-152:
“However, among rodents, only one mice species (Abrothrix longipilis) deposits seeds in potential good
places for germination. Nevertheless, germination normally occurs when seeds are on top soil while this
rodent buries them under soil or leaf litter between 7 and 9.4 cm deep [27].”
Lines 238-239: Consider the possibility to rephrase here. For example "... SDE (41) to provide estimates
of seedling recruitment in four scenarios..." When talking about SDE consider also the original article
suggesting the use of this approach to evaluate dispersal suscess (e.g. Schupp et al. 2010 Seed
dispersal effectiveness revisited: a conceptual review. New Phytol 188: 333-353)
R: As suggested, we re-phrased the sentence in lines 239-240: “We then compared A. araucana seed
dispersal efficiency (SDE) [41] to provide estimates of seedling recruitment in four scenarios”. We also
cited Schump et al 2010 and include an explanation of the use of SDE as follows: “The analysis of SDE is
a good approach to evaluate dispersal success. [59]”
Please include some comments about the expectations of SDE outcomes with/without parakeets and
with/without human harvesting of seeds in your introduction (lines 128-134).
R: We have included the reviewer’ suggestion as follows: “) the presence of partially damaged seed by
parakeets will increase seed dispersal efficiency (SDE), and 5) this increment in SDE will be more
important in those areas subject to human seed collection.”
Please rephrase sentences in lines 288-291 to clarify your argument to the reader. The increase in SDE
(which is a nice result) occurs only in sites under heavy harvesting by humans.
R: We tried to improve clarity by indicating the increment occurs under human pressure as follows in
lines 291-294: “In areas under heavy harvesting by humans, the increment of almost 80% in SDE of
seeds partially consumed by parakeets could promote a significant demographic effect given that an
increment in recruitment at low seed densities could disproportionally improve growth rate in long-lived
species.”
Lines 291-294: Rephrase sentences to make clear your argument. I suggest you to break sentence in
two. Avoid also the use of "them", as you have parakeets and seeds in same sentence.
R: We clarified the argument as suggested by the reviewer by modifying the sentence as follows in lines
295-297: “Most seeds produced during inter-mast years are expected to be lost due to predation by
parakeets. These birds predate completely up to a 20% of the seeds produced by a tree, and 52% of
seeds are >50% damaged [37].”
Lines 328-330: "Mapuche-Pewenche people have traditionally included A. araucana seeds in their diet
without compromising the species regeneration." To me this sentence seems in contradiction with some
of the main arguments of the text. If plant regeneration is seed limited it is likely that seed harvesting
limits plant regeneration. The argument that parakeets may increase regeneration by reducing
harvesting of partially damaged seeds agree with this and it is the core of the article. Probably the
authors may have some other evidence in this respect (that indigenous people harvest do not threat the
species) but the way you are communicating this here seems in contradiction with your argument
developed before. Maybe a reference here would help. Or consider rephrase. It would be interesting to
listen if indigenous people also avoid harvesting partially damaged seeds, as this would provide a more
long term perspective (from the past) of the output of parakeet-plant-human interaction.
R: We agree with the reviewer. Given we consider that the sustainability of original people seed
collection is not properly assessed we decided to remove that sentence. Now it reads as follows in lines
331-332: “Mapuche-Pewenche people might have acted as seed dispersers while moving them across
the landscape [51].”
Fig 1. I have seen that the authors replaced Fig 1a with a human seed collector by the parakeet. I agree
with the change, as the image of the seed collector could potentially bring him in trouble due to illegal
harvesting activities. Fig 1b is very nice and does not allow recognition of individual people, which seems
good. Legend of Fig 1b could stop at "collecting seeds", as more details are provided in the text.
R: thank you for the comment. We have modified the legend as suggested.
Fig. 2: make clear to the reader that "N" refers to the number of trees sampled in each site.
R: we included the reviewer’s comment as follows: “N= number of trees sampled in each site.”
