The manuscript "Digital diagnosis of severe pathologies in a New Jersey dinosaur" by Anné et al.
presents the first record of a Septic Arthritis in dinosaurs. The paper is well written, straight
forward and the diagnosis is sounded due a detailed comparison with other diseases with similar
appearance. However, I recommend that authors include the information of the Suppl. Info. into
the main manuscript. These information does not need to be excluded from the main text.
Furthermore, I would like see that the authors add a short discussion section, where they put the
pathology in the bigger picture. Specific comments can be found in the pdf attached. I
recommend minor revisions. See Appendix A.

- Because at least part of this project is focused on digital conservation of a specimen that will
deteriorate over time, there should be some long-term archival of the data. This is not currently
mentioned in the paper, but must be (in my view--I do not know what the journal-specific policy
is). A repository such as MorphoSource or Dryad would certainly be appropriate (for both
surface scan and the XMT), or another repository method of the authors' choice. There are
mentions of surface files (STL_Ulna, STL_Radius), but I did not see them with the manuscript
itself. It is of course good that these are included, but the CT slices themselves should also be
available (if they are too large, as I suspect, one of the aforementioned archives would be a good
place to deposit them).

This manuscript provides a succinct and informative description of an anomalous set of dinosaur
bones from New Jersey. It is a useful addition to the primary literature. Overall, the figures and
description are to a high standard, and I only spotted a few specific areas of suggested revision.
These are outlined below.
- I would suggest a rework of the title to be more specific and informative. The real highlight of
the paper is the identification of potential septic arthritis in a dinosaur; the digital diagnosis is
"only" the tool that allowed this. One possibility might be, "First record of septic arthritis in a
dinosaur diagnosed with XMT" or even simply "First record of septic arthritis in a dinosaur."
- I would also suggest a revision of the abstract to include more information, particularly because
this may be the only thing that many readers bother with. What features indicate septic arthritis?
Where exactly was the dinosaur discovered? What formation?
- Additional geological information should be included within the main body of the paper. How
old is the Navesink Formation? What are its stratigraphic relationships? What other organisms
are found there? The relevant text in the supplemental information could be moved into the main
manuscript. In fact, unless there are major length limits imposed by the journal (and I didn't see
any in my quick browse of the instructions to authors), all of the information in the supplemental
information could be moved into the main text.
- A brief statement on how the specimen was assigned to Hadrosauridae should be included. I
have no doubt as to the identification (they really look hadrosaurid, after all), but a sentence or
two on the comparisons would be appropriate. Additionally, please include basic maximum
length measurements for the radius and ulna.
- The description and figures of the bone lesions generally seem to be on point. I did have one
question on the diagnosis, though; given the (presumed) bone infection that the authors note,
would it be more accurate to describe this as septic arthritis with secondary osteomyelitis?
Perhaps someone who is more steeped in the extant veterinary literature than I could weigh in on
this.
- Because at least part of this project is focused on digital conservation of a specimen that will
deteriorate over time, there should be some long-term archival of the data. This is not currently
mentioned in the paper, but must be (in my view). A repository such as MorphoSource or Dryad
would certainly be appropriate (for both surface scan and the XMT), or another repository
method of the authors' choice. There are mentions of surface files in the manuscript (STL_Ulna,
STL_Radius), but I did not see them available with the manuscript itself on the RSOS review
portal. It is of course good that STL's will be included included, but the CT slices themselves
should also be available (if they are too large for supplemental info directly with the paper, as I
suspect, one of the aforementioned archives would be a good place to deposit them).
- p. 5, line 155: I think there is a numbering error, as references 4 and 24 do not seemingly match
wtih the text on hadrosauroid osteomyeltis. Presumably #24 should be #25? In which case you
may want to more specifically cite articles within the hadrosaur volume. Please check the
numbers on the references throughout, to ensure they match.
- p. 5, line 162: rephrase "making this the first documented case of this condition within the
Dinosauria" to specify "non-avian Dinosauria"

15 9 ABSTRACT
16
17 10 The identification and interpretation of pathologies in the fossil record allows for unique insights into
18 11 the life histories of extinct organisms. However, the rarity of such finds limits not only the sample size
19
20 12 for palaeopathologic studies, but also the types of analyses that may be performed. In this study, we
21 13 present the first occurrence of a palaeopathology in a vertebrate from the Mesozoic of the East Coast
22
23 14 of North America (Appalachia), the pathologic ulna and radius of an indeterminate hadrosaur. The
24 15 application of X-Ray MicroTomography (XMT) allowed for both detailed and more accurate
25
26 16 diagnosis of the pathologic condition as well as virtual conservation of the specimen. Based on extant
27 17 archosaurian comparisons, the hadrosaur was diagnosed with severe septic arthritis affecting the
28
29 18 proximal ulna and radius. To our knowledge, this is the first recorded account of septic arthritis in
30
19 dinosaurs. The severity of the pathology suggests the animal suffered with this condition for some
31
32 20 time before death. Unfortunately, only the ulna and radius were found. Thus, the extent to which the
33
21 condition spread to other parts of the body is unknown.

40 25 INTRODUCTION
41 26 The Mesozoic terrestrial fauna of eastern North America is poorly represented in the fossil record,
42
43 27 consisting mostly of trackways and rare skeletal remains [1]. The Late Cretaceous exposures in
44 28 particular produce extremely fragmentary terrestrial remains, which are often attributed to deposition
45
46 29 by “bloat and float” in the marine sediments [1-2]. Despite the condition of the fossils, dinosaurs from
47 30 the Late Cretaceous Appalachia are evolutionarily significant in that they represent an entirely
48
49 31 separate ecosystem from the Laramidian fauna; the western North America Late Cretaceous fauna
50 32 well-known for species such as Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops [1-3]. East coast specimens are also of
51
52 33 historic significance, with the Mesozoic exposures of New Jersey representing the birth place of
53 34 academic vertebrate palaeontology in the Americas [1-3]. Unfortunately, many of the specimens are
54
55 35 not only fragmentary, but are also infected by pyrite disease, which makes them extremely fragile.
56
36 Given the rare state of such fossils, it was a surprise that a pathological specimen, which are rare even

4
38 Gloucester County, New Jersey [2].

6 39
7
40 Palaeopathology, the study of ancient diseases and trauma, offers a unique snapshot into the
8
9 41 immunology and life histories of extinct animals [4-6]. These studies are most prominent in
10
11 42 vertebrates since conditions that affect bone are much more likely to be preserved than soft tissue
12 43 conditions. In addition, the most reliable method for palaeopathological diagnosis is histological
13
14 44 analysis, which often requires destructive sampling via thin section preparation. This limits the
15 45 number of species and specimens that can be sampled, due both to the rarity of the preserved
16
17 46 condition and the desire to conserve specimens for future use through non-destructive analyses. Thus,
18 47 the pathologic New Jersey hadrosaur (NJSM GP11961) represents a very rare find given the
19
20 48 provenance and pathological condition. However, not only is the specimen rare, but it is extremely
21 49 fragile and in danger of “self-destruction”, which has been documented for many of the specimens
22
23 50 collected from this site. This makes thin sectioning impossible, limiting the accuracy of potential
24 51 diagnoses.
25
26 52
27 53 Fortunately, the 21st century has seen a large increase in both the power and availability of non-
28
29 54 destructive analytical techniques such as X-Ray MicroTomography (micro CT, XMT). Such tools
30
55 have allowed palaeopathologists to both increase the sample size and the integrity of their diagnoses
31
32 56 through non-destructive internal analysis [5, 7-10]. Here we present XMT data from the pathological
33
57 hadrosaur ulna and radius (NJSM GP11961) to 1) accurately diagnose the pathological condition and
34
35 58 2) digitally conserve a rare and important specimen.
36
37 59
38 60 METHODS AND MATERIALS
39
40 61 NJSM GP11961 was collected from the Navesink Formation, approximately 1 m below the contact
41 62 with the overlying Hornerstown Formation. The specimen consists of a pathological ulna and radius
42
43 63 from a hadrosaur (family Hadrosauridae), which were fused at the time of discovery, but have since
44 64 been separated. Both skeletal elements were scanned using a Nikon Metrology (X-Tek) HMXST225
45
46 65 MicroCT system at the Center for Nanoscale Systems at Harvard University (Figure S1). Each sample
47 66 was embedded in styrofoam and mounted onto the X-Tek stage to ensure that the bones neither broke
48
49 67 nor moved during scanning. Only the proximal ends (area of interest with pathology) were scanned as
50 68 full scans were not possible due to the size limitations of the X-Tek system. The entire bone may have
51
52 69 been scanned using a medical CT system, but given the importance of high resolution for the
53 70 diagnosis of the pathology, we deemed the use of the XMT scanner justified. The source voltage and
54
55 71 current settings were paired with 0.25 mm Cu filters to minimize beam hardening while maintaining
56
72 the optimal spectral width and intensity (desired transmission through the specimen). The white target
57
58 73 (brightest pixel on the scan) was set to 60,000 counts for the selected gain in order to reduce gain. In

3 74 order to reduce scan time, ring artefacts were not minimized. Integration time was set at 1000 ms to
4
75 achieve maximum imaging resolution. The radius was scanned at a voxel size of 96.82 µm with a
5
6 76 voltage of 130 kV and current of 120 µA. The ulna was scanned at a voxel size of 127.03 µm with a
7
8 77 voltage of 160 kV and current of 135 µA.

10
11 79 After scanning, the samples were imported into the proprietary CTPro3D software paired with the
12
80 HMXST225 MicroCT to create a vgl file from the image stack. The vgl file was then imported into
13
14 81 VGStudioMAX for reconstruction. The scans were modified for optimum contrast and then exported
15
82 as jpg image stacks. These image stacks were then put into Materialize Mimics in order to reduce
16
17 83 triangle count and delete floating objects. Materialize Mimics allows for visualization of slices in
18

20 85 microstructural changes in the bone qualitatively. In Mimics, files were exported into the associated
21
22 86 Materialize 3-matic software in order to generate three-dimensional surface files (Supplemental files
23 87 STL_Ulna, STL_Radius).
24
25 88
26 89 All results from the hadrosaur were then compared to known conditions in extant avians and reptiles
27
28 90 for diagnosis of the pathological condition (Table 1).
29 91
30
31 92 RESULTS
32 93 Ulna: The affected area is most severe for the first ~14 cm of the proximal end, but extends almost
33
34 94 half the total length of the element (~31 cm; Figure 1). There is heavy remodelling resulting in a
35 95 cauliflower-like texture present in some areas, especially around the articulation surfaces (Figure 1).
36
37 96 A large lesion and several smaller lesions evident of necrosis are seen on the proximal articulation
38 97 surface (Figure 1; red circle). XMT scans reveal the extent of the lesions especially within the
39
40 98 expansion along the radius/ulna articular surface (Figure 2B). Along the olecranon process, the
41
99 cortical wall is non-existent except for a small patch on the radial articulation surface. Internal
42
43 100 examination also revealed that the pathology also consists of reactive bone growth (Figure 2). A large
44
101 enthesophyte (abnormal bony projection along tendon/ligament attachments [6]) is located on the
45
46 102 outer surface (Figure 2A). Radial bone growth is seen along the entire medial surface of the ulna,
47
48 103 spreading distally to cover the circumference of the ulna (Figure 2). The radial growth then decreases
49 104 distally, tapering completely away to a small area on the radial articulation surface where there are
50
51 105 two large protrusions on either side of the lateral process (Figure 2C, D). One of these protrusions
52 106 consists of unorganized, random tissue orientation (Figure 2C, circled red). The other is in a more
53
54 107 compact, unidirectional orientation, suggesting a second enthesophyte (Figure 2C, red arrow).

3 109 Radius: The pathological condition of the radius is more localised than in the ulna. Unlike the ulna,
4
110 the pathological bone growth is easily observable, even in gross examination, and has a sharp contact
5
6 111 with the normal bone, creating an easily-discernable outline (Figure 3). XMT revealed that despite the
7
112 clear distinction on the outside, the internal structure of the radius is a mess of ‘frothy’ bone with the
8
9 113 outline of the radius unclear for the first proximal 3 cm (1/3) of the pathology (Figure 4A,B).
10
11 114 Extensive pathological growth is present distally and is composed of two morphologically distinct
12 115 types of tissue. One is very porous; while the other has a wood-like appearance with long struts of
13
14 116 bone that have grains following the circumference of the radius (Figure 4A, B, red arrow).There is a
15 117 large gap between the normal cortical wall of the radius and these “woody” growths, with the possible
16
17 118 origin point for these growths located much more distally. Eventually the typical dense cortical bone
18 119 associated with the normal radius cortex dominates and pathological growth decreases, which persists
19
20 120 up to 20 cm from the proximal end of the radius (Figure 4C, D).
21 121
22
23 122 DIAGNOSIS
24 123 The ulna and radius of NJSM GP11961 show signs of both excessive bone necrosis and reactive
25
26 124 (pathological) bone growth, which can be attributed to several conditions seen in reptiles and birds
27 125 (Table 1). Neoplasia can be excluded since it is both rare (in wild individuals) and is a reactive
28
29 126 (pathological growth) condition [11-15]. Osteopetrosis is another exclusively reactive condition, and
30
127 is only found in the diaphysis of long bones in poultry [16]. Thus, both the location of the pathology
31
32 128 (diaphysis vs joints) and its occurrence only in poultry make it an unlikely cause. Gout, a common
33
129 condition in reptiles, causes lytic lesions within the joints through the deposition of urate crystals [15,
34
35 130 17]. However, gout is strictly destructive and not associated with reactive bone growth. Tuberculosis
36
37 131 can also be ruled out since it is also a strictly destructive condition [14, 18].
38 132
39
40 133 The most likely explanation for the given pathology is a form of osteoarthritis, which is defined as
41 134 any condition affecting moveable joints by deterioration of articular cartilage, osteophyte (bone spur)
42
43 135 formation, bone remodelling and changes in the surrounding joint tissue [19]. Such conditions are
44 136 usually localised in reptiles, unlike in humans where these conditions can spread throughout the body
45
46 137 [20]. Osteoarthritis in avians and reptiles is associated with additional complications such as disease,
47 138 trauma, or infection [14-15, 21]. Two osteoarthritic conditions associated with necrosis and reactive
48
49 139 bone growth are osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. The main difference between the two is that
50 140 osteomyelitis is usually associated with the infection of ossified tissue (e.g. bone), whereas septic
51
52 141 arthritis is usually associated with the infection of non-ossified tissue (e.g. cartilage) [6]. Septic
53 142 arthritis does affect bone tissue as it can result in bone erosion and ankylosing due to the destruction
54
55 143 of articular cartilage [6]. However, this distinction is not always made clear in veterinary cases where
56
144 both conditions are often labelled as osteomyelitis (e.g. [13, 22]).

3 146 In the case of the NJSM GP11961, the erosional attributes, combined with the highly reactive bone
4
147 growth and the fusion of the elements suggest that this condition is septic arthritis. Our interpretation
5
6 148 is necrosis and remodelling of the elbow joint was caused by the loss of articular cartilage due to
7
149 septic arthritis. The weakening and eventual destruction of the joint caused pathological bone growth
8
9 150 and ankylosis of bone acting in response to the pathology in order to strengthen the joint. Destruction
10
11 151 of the olecranon process also resulted in the formation of the two enthesophytes located along the ulna
12 152 for alternative tendon and ligament attachment sites [6].
13
14 153
15 154 Septic arthritis has not been previously noted in dinosaurs, though osteomyelitis has been identified in
16
17 155 all dinosaurian groups including other hadrosauroids [4, 24]. In this study, osteomyelitis was excluded
18 156 due to the location around the elbow joint and reactive nature of the condition since there is little to no
19
20 157 periosteal reactive bone growth associated with osteomyelitis in birds and reptiles [13]. On the other
21 158 hand, septic arthritis is reactive in reptiles and can lead to ankylosis as has been previously noted [24].
22
23 159 Although there are reports of highly reactive osteomyelitis in birds [25], the most reactive forms are
24 160 chronic and fungal arthritis, which may have been initially caused by septic arthritis [13]. Thus, we
25
26 161 interpret septic arthritis as the cause of the pathology found in NJSM GP11961, making this the first
27 162 documented case of this condition within the Dinosauria.
28

164 CONCLUSIONS
31
32 165 Palaeopathological studies allow unique insights into extinct animal physiology through the
33
166 comparative study of conditions and modes of immunity seen in comparable extant species. The
34
35 167 application of non-destructive internal examination through the use of high-resolution XMT scans are
36
37 168 crucial for such studies and allow for the sampling and study of many more specimens and species. In
38 169 this study, XMT scans allowed for the detailed diagnosis of a rare and fragile hadrosaur specimen
39
40 170 from New Jersey. We diagnose the palaeopathology as septic arthritis; the first case documented in
41 171 the Dinosauria. This diagnosis was only possible due to the internal examination of the pathology by
42
43 172 XMT, which has also ensured that such information will not be lost thanks to the digital data now
44 173 being accessible.

30 scanned is indicated on the gross picture insert. Locations for the transverse sections are marked by red
31 lines on the longitudinal section. The original outline of the bone is completely unrecognisable on the
proximal end, with severe, radial bone growth (A-B; red arrow). There is a large gap between the
32 pathological growth and the original cortex of the radius (A-B; red arrows). The outline of the radius
33 becomes clear with the appearance of the normal cortical bone structure moving distally (C-D; original
34 radius outline circled in red). Scale bar represents 10 mm.

Re: Manuscript: “Digital diagnosis of severe pathologies in a New Jersey dinosaur”
Manuscript ID: RSOS-160222
Dear Open Science editorial staff,
Please find attached our revised manuscript, “Digital diagnosis of severe pathologies in a New Jersey
dinosaur” (RSOS-160222) by Anné et al. (Anneetal2016_HadroPath_TrackChanges).
We were happy to see that both reviewers felt that this paper is “well written, straight forward and the
diagnosis is sounded” and that it is “a useful addition to the primary literature”.
The majority of the comments are from reviewer two concerning some more detailed information on
the geology, the assignment of hadrosaur to the specimen, and the assignment of the diagnosis. Both
reviewers agree that the Supplementary Information should be added into the main body. We thank
the reviewers for their constructive comments and we have added their suggestions on these matters.
We have carefully responded to all of the specific comments raised by the reviewers and present this
in a point-by-point list below, as well as through track changes within the manuscript
(Anneetal2016_HadroPath_TrackChanges).
We would like to thank you for accepting our manuscript to Open Science. We hope our
modifications will satisfy both reviewers, and look forward to seeing the final version appear in your
journal.
Sincerely,
Dr. Jennifer Anné et al.

Below we present a detailed response with reviewers’ comments copied in italics and our response in
normal typeface. When referenced, the appropriate page and line number are included referring to the
location of the comment and change.
General Reviewer Comments:
Both reviewers felt that the information presented in the SI should be moved to the main body of the
text. This information is now presented in the Materials and Methods section (Lines 67-104).
Reviewer 1: We would like to thank reviewer 1 for their comment, “The paper is well written,
straight forward and the diagnosis is sounded due a detailed comparison with other diseases with
similar appearance."
Reviewer 1 Specific Comments:
I would like see that the authors add a short discussion section, where they put the pathology in the
bigger picture
We agree with the reviewer that this in a significant result in palaeopathology in that it shows the
importance of 1) internal morphology when interpreting palaeopathologies and 2) the use of reptilian
and avian comparisons for interpretation We have added a few more lines to emphasise these points,
which are mentioned in both the discussion and conclusion (Lines 188-189, 211-212).
Reviewer 2: Again, we would like to thank reviewer 2 for their comment, “It is a useful addition to
the primary literature.” We are also happy to see the reviewer feels that our “figures and description
are to a high standard.”
Most of the comments from reviewer 2 involve reformatting of the title, abstract and some additional
information on the geologic setting. We have acted upon all there comments and feel the manuscript
has been improved as a result.
Reviewer 2 Specific Comments:
I would suggest a rework of the title to be more specific and informative. The real highlight of the
paper is the identification of potential septic arthritis in a dinosaur; the digital diagnosis is "only" the
tool that allowed this. One possibility might be, "First record of septic arthritis in a dinosaur
diagnosed with XMT" or even simply "First record of septic arthritis in a dinosaur."
We thank the reviewer for help us strengthen our title and have revised it to now read: “First diagnosis
of septic arthritis in a dinosaur”
I would also suggest a revision of the abstract to include more information, particularly because this
may be the only thing that many readers bother with. What features indicate septic arthritis? Where
exactly was the dinosaur discovered? What formation?
Again we thank the reviewer for helping us strengthen the abstract. We have revised the abstract to
now include the points addressed in the reviewer’s comments (Lines 14-15, 18-19).
A brief statement on how the specimen was assigned to Hadrosauridae should be included. I have no
doubt as to the identification (they really look hadrosaurid, after all), but a sentence or two on the
comparisons would be appropriate. Additionally, please include basic maximum length measurements
for the radius and ulna.
This has been addressed in Lines 79-82.
The description and figures of the bone lesions generally seem to be on point. I did have one question
on the diagnosis, though; given the (presumed) bone infection that the authors note, would it be more
Page 3
accurate to describe this as septic arthritis with secondary osteomyelitis? Perhaps someone who is
more steeped in the extant veterinary literature than I could weigh in on this.
We understand the confusion seen by the reviewer, as the distinction between these two conditions is
slight and difficult to find in the veterinary literature. The two most distinguishing characters are the
start of the infection (internally for osteomyelitis and externally for septic arthritis) and the lack of
periosteal reaction in osteomyelitis (Table 1). We have kept the two conditions separate, as this is how
they are presented in the literature.
Because at least part of this project is focused on digital conservation of a specimen that will
deteriorate over time, there should be some long-term archival of the data. This is not currently
mentioned in the paper, but must be (in my view). A repository such as MorphoSource or Dryad
would certainly be appropriate (for both surface scan and the XMT), or another repository method of
the authors' choice. There are mentions of surface files in the manuscript (STL_Ulna, STL_Radius),
but I did not see them available with the manuscript itself on the RSOS review portal. It is of course
good that STL's will be included included, but the CT slices themselves should also be available (if
they are too large for supplemental info directly with the paper, as I suspect, one of the
aforementioned archives would be a good place to deposit them).
We completely agree that all data should be made open access. We had initially tried to load some of
the files during the initial submission, but could not due to file size limits. We will make all files
available through Dryad now that the manuscript has been accepted. The Dryad link is sighted in Line
114.
p. 5, line 155: I think there is a numbering error, as references 4 and 24 do not seemingly match wtih
the text on hadrosauroid osteomyeltis. Presumably #24 should be #25? In which case you may want to
more specifically cite articles within the hadrosaur volume. Please check the numbers on the
references throughout, to ensure they match.
We thank the reviewer for finding this mistype. The correct reference numbers should be 4
(Rothschild and Martin, 2006) and 23 (now reference 26; Eberth and Evans, 2014). This has been
changed in the manuscript (Line 187).
p. 5, line 162: rephrase "making this the first documented case of this condition within the
Dinosauria" to specify "non-avian Dinosauria"
This comment has been addressed (Line 194).
