(evaluative) conditioning. This is an issue that has been unresolved for at least 20 years and
continues to be a focus for methodological debate. The present high-powered studies present
drawings of cars for 17 or 1000 msec as CSs associated with pleasant or unpleasant sounds (Exp.
1), cartoon images for 20, 30, or 1000 msec paired with sounds (Exp. 2), and cartoon images for 20
or 1000 msec (Exp. 3). In the first 2 experiments participants’ awareness of the CS was assessed
trial-by-trial using a forced-choice test with 8 (Exp. 1) or 4 (Exp. 2) options. Finally participants
made liking ratings for the CSs.
The main findings are that while clear evaluative conditioning is obtained for the long CSs, it is
absent for the short ones – in other words, no evaluative conditioning is obtained for near-
invisible stimuli. In all cases participants were able to select the correct CS in the trial-by-trial
awareness check. Exp. 3 will be high-powered and will differ from Exp. 2 only in the removal of
the awareness check.
It is clear that this work represents a substantial step forward in terms of power and rigour. The
data analysis is very thorough and the use of Bayesian statistics wholly appropriate given that
null effects are the primary outcome.
I have one significant concern (albeit just about terminology) and some more minor points. The
authors frame the entire study around subliminal evaluative conditioning, but the evidence
across all experiments and conditions shows that – if the forced-choice test is taken as a measure
of visibility – then the stimuli were visible at all presentation durations, even 20 msec. Thus a
better description of what these experiments show is that very brief and near-threshold CSs do
not sustain evaluative conditioning. Saying that they show that subliminal CSs don’t show
conditioning seems an inappropriate conclusion. It simply doesn’t seem accurate to talk about
‘subliminal’ stimuli unless they can be shown to be invisible by whatever method the researchers
choose to use to measure awareness (forced-choice identification in this case).
Of course this does open up the question of why the authors haven’t tried presenting CSs for
even less than 20 msec to achieve genuine invisibility. I do not believe this is a major weakness of
the present research, as it is very hard to imagine that (say) 10 msec but not 20 msec CSs will
sustain evaluative conditioning, but the authors do need to acknowledge that they have not
achieved subliminality.
While the writing is generally very clear, the discussion of past research at the bottom of p3 is
very cryptic and likely to go over the head of a non-expert. The authors need to explain what the
difference is between ‘valence’ and ‘specific’ contingencies, and what “awareness of a given
specific CS-US contingency is controlled for” means.
It is a little confusing that visibility is described before evaluation in the results of Exp. 1 but vice
versa in Exp. 2.

The rationale and significance behind the overall research question is sound.
It is concerning that the CSs at the short duration can be perceived above chance (this is only a
problem if you do find evidence for subliminal EC, as it can be argued that it was not subliminal,
but strengthens your case if you do not find evidence).
Methods are detailed sufficiently.

The manuscript has been reviewed favourably by two expert reviewers. Reviewer 1 recommends
several revisions to improve clarity. Given the above-chance visibility observed, both reviewers
also question the validity of intepreting the study as a test of subliminal evaluative conditioning,
as opposed to near-threshold conditioning. A minor revision prior to awarding in principle
acceptance is recommended.

The authors have completed their pre-registered experiment and analysis according to plan and
the resulting ms. is clearly a contribution to the literature. Although it will not be the final word
on evaluative conditioning with near-threshold stimuli, it clearly takes the debate forward.
I have a couple of minor suggestions. The conditions in Fig. 5 should be plotted the other way
round (20 ms on the left and 1000 ms on the right) for consistency with the other figures.
More importantly, the data graphed in this figure (for the 20 ms condition for rating first
participants) do not allow us to see the distribution of DIFFERENCES between positive and
negative US valences across participants. It would be helpful to add a graph or panel specifically
depicting the distribution of these differences, so the reader can see whether the entire
distribution is shifted slightly above 0, or whether most cluster around 0 with a few tending
towards positive difference scores.

ar Dr. Chambers, dear reviewers,
ank you for the feedback on our manuscript. We are delighted to be given the chance to publish our
earch in 'Royal Society Open Science'. Please find attached the revised manuscript. We have attended to
h of the points that were raised, and we hope the manuscript has improved to the point of being
eptable at Stage 1. Below we outline how we have addressed all issues mentioned in the reviews in order.
ajor comment related to the above-threshold CS visibility noted by both reviewers:
: Thus a better description of what these experiments show is that very brief and near-threshold
s do not sustain evaluative conditioning.
: It is concerning that the CSs at the short duration can be perceived above chance (this is only a
blem if you do find evidence for subliminal EC, as it can be argued that it was not subliminal, but
engthens your case if you do not find evidence).
e first comment focuses on terminology, the second on interpretation. We agree that it is problematic to
cuss subliminal EC, even though CS identification is above chance, and that we have been less than clear
ut it. Our strategy is to investigate the theoretical issue of the possibility of subliminal and automatic EC,
we are implementing slightly above-chance presentation conditions to do so, in order to give automatic
cesses a fair chance. This is now more clearly stated in the introductory section “The present study” (page
ine 178). To clarify terminology, in the revision we use the term “subliminal” only when discussing
oretical claims (e.g., as made by other authors) but refrain from doing so when describing our methods.
nor comments:
e discussion of past research at the bottom of p. 3 is very cryptic
ank you for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer and simplified the wording of that paragraph
h the goal of focusing on the mixed state of the evidence (instead of expanding the discussion of the
erent types of retrospective assessments of awareness).
he figure of 0.93% at line 485 meant to be 93%?
ank you for spotting this error. We changed 0.93 to 93% in the current version.
ibility is described before evaluation in the results of Exp. 1 but vice versa in Exp. 2.
s inconsistency has now been resolved: In the revised manuscript, for both Experiments 1 and 2, a
section “Visibility” first reports CS visibility results, followed by evaluation results.
are looking forward to your response. As mentioned before, all preparations are completed and we are
dy to start the data collection immediately.
cerely,
ias Heycke, Frederik Aust, & Christoph Stahl
Appendix B
Dear Dr. Chambers, dear anonymous reviewers,
attached you will find a revised version of our manuscript including the pre-registered
Experiment 3. We collected the data for Experiment 3 as pre-registered and report our
pre-planned analyses in the section labeled “Confirmatory Analyses”. Additional analyses
are included in the section labeled “Exploratory Analyses”. We had to collect our previously
set maximum of 300 (paid) participants (363 in total) which is the main reason for the
delayed revision. In contrast to previous studies, we find some evidence for an EC effect
with briefly presented CSs in this third Experiment. This finding lends importance to the
used paradigm and we believe it is an important piece in the discussion on EC effects with
briefly presented stimuli.
All data is available at the OSF (https://osf.io/cx5eh/; link also included in the manuscript),
which also includes the analysis script and additional material. The data of Experiment 3
were additionally collected under a Born Open Data protocol in Experiment 3 (i.e., data were
uploaded to a public repository after every day of data collection; see Rouder, 2016). These
data files can be found here: https://github.com/methexp/rawdata/tree/master/croco3.
While revising the manuscript we unfortunately found some minor reporting errors in the
already approved part of the manuscript. These errors are unrelated to the methods used in
the registered Experiment 3, and our conclusions remain unaltered. With your permission,
we would like make the following changes:
(1) Unify the use of cross-modal
We realized we used “cross-modal”, “crossmodal”and “cross modal” interchangeably throughout
the manuscript and now changed it to only state “cross-modal”.
(2) Inconsistency in number of excluded participants in Experiment 1
One participant was accidental counted twice in the outlier analysis. Now the manuscript
correctly states, that 9 participants were excluded (10 previously). This was merely a
reporting error and all reported analyses are correct.
(3) Anchors of slider
The anchors on the sliders used for the dependent variable were labeled as -100 and 100.
We accidentally reported that the anchors were labeled as 0 and 200 (correspondingly to the
numbers that were internally saved and used for the analyses). The manuscript now reads
as follows:
Previously
After the learning task, participants indicated how much they liked each CS
(presented in random order) on a slider ranging from 0 (not at all) to 200 (very
much).
Now [line: 235]
After the learning task, participants indicated how much they liked each CS
(presented in random order) on a slider ranging from -100 (not at all) to 100
(very much; saved as 0 to 200).
(4) Computation of Bayes Factors in the Choice Analyses
We found a minor error in the calculation of Bayes Factors in the choice analysis in Experiment
1. Correcting these errors resulted in negligible changes for all but two Bayes Factors. The
section reporting the notable cases was changed as follows:
Previously
The Bayesian analysis indicated that positively paired CSs were not chosen
more frequently than negatively paired CSs, neither when they were presented
for 17 ms (BF01 = 6.71), d = 0.23, 95% HDI [-0.06, 0.53]) nor for 1000 ms
(BF01 = 6.03, d = 0.25, 95% HDI[-0.05, 0.55].
Now [line: 324]
The Bayesian analysis testing whether positively paired CSs were chosen more
frequently than negatively paired CSs was inconclusive, both for CSs presented
for 17 ms (BF01 = 1.87, d = 0.23, 95% HDI[-0.06, 0.53]) and 1000 ms (BF01 =
1.67, d = 0.25, 95% HDI[-0.05, 0.55]).
(5) Clarification of priors in Bayesian Choice Analysis in text and appendix
In our analysis of the choice data we used sum-to-zero coding (i.e., -1 and 1) for all factors.
The prior was thus placed on half the magnitude of the effect. We now realize that the
wording of the data analysis section may be misunderstood and would like to change the
reported scaling parameter to communicate the prior that we placed on the effect rather
than the “half-effect”. We would additionally like to make the same adjustments in the
visualization of priors in den Appendix in order to visualize the priors of the effect, not the
“half-effect”.
Previously
To compute Bayes factors we used independent Cauchy priors with scaling
parameters r = 0.45 for all experimental factors and r = 1.28 for the intercept
(see Appendix B [39]).
Now [line: 263]
To compute Bayes factors we used independent Cauchy priors with scaling
parameters r = 0.91 for all experimental factors and r = 1.28 for the intercept
(see Appendix B [39]).
We apologize for the inconvenience, but we believe that these changes will improve the
quality of our manuscript. Please let us know if you need any additional information.
Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Chambers, dear anonymous reviewer,
thank you very much for the swift and positive feedback and thank you once again for the
valuable comments. Below you can find our response to the requested changes. We did not
make any additional changes to the manuscript.
Please note that the manuscript was written in RMarkdown (see osf.io/2nj6m) and while
the produced MS Word version should be exactly as we intended, we have attached a PDF
version for referencing purposes.
Sincerely,
Tobias Heycke, Frederik Aust, Christoph Stahl
(1) Registered and Unregistered
To ensure that readers can immediately distinguish the registered and unregistered experiments, please
note briefly (either as a separate sentence or integrated into the existing prose) at the end of the main
Introduction that Experiment 1 and 2 were unregistered, and that only Experiment 3 was preregistered.
On p8 and p14 please also rename Experiment 1 “Unregistered Experiment 1”, and Experiment 2
“Unregistered Experiment 2”.
We changed the headers of Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 accordingly and the sentence at end of
introduction now reads:
“In the unregistered Experiments 1 and 2, we used an online visibility-check task as an index of
contingency awareness; the pre-registered Experiment 3 tested whether near-threshold cross-modal EC
can be found in the absence of an online visibility check.”
(2) Figure 5
The conditions in Fig. 5 should be plotted the other way round (20 ms on the left and 1000 ms on the
right) for consistency with the other figures.
We made the requested adjustment to Figure 5.
(3) Additional figure with effects scores
More importantly, the data graphed in this figure (for the 20 ms condition for rating first participants) do
not allow us to see the distribution of DIFFERENCES between positive and negative US valences across
participants. It would be helpful to add a graph or panel specifically depicting the distribution of these
differences, so the reader can see whether the entire distribution is shifted slightly above 0, or whether
most cluster around 0 with a few tending towards positive difference scores.
We agree that a figure depicting indiviual EC-effect scores would help the reader to understand the data
better. We therefore added a Figure 6 which includes all EC effects from Experiment 1, 2, and 3
depicting (1) individual EC effects, (2) the mean EC effect and (3) the highest density interval (HDI) for
each mean effect. We reference to this figure in the analysis section of Experiment 3 which
now reads:
“Interestingly, we also observed an indication for the presence of an EC effect for briefly presented CSs,
BF10 = 6.88, d = 0.24, 95% HDI [0.07, 0.42], see Figure 5 (and see Figure 6 for a visual comparison of
all EC effects).”
