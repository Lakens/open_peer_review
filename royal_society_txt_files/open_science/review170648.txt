In this paper, the authors introduce an optimal control/Nash game framework for pedestrian
motion modeling. Starting from a microscale stochastic model, a multi-objective optimization
problem is formulated, in which the agents aim at reaching a certain position while avoiding
collisions between them. Then, a Fokker-Planck framework for the evolution of the PDF of the
agents is proposed, and the optimization problem is cast for the macroscale model.
For a two-agent system, the differential game consists of a cost penalizing the distance to the
target, the control energy of each agent, and a coupling term penalizing collisions. The dynamical
constraints are two decoupled FP equations. The simultaneous minimization of the costs
introduces via the control variables acting on the drift.
While the solution of the differential game is a Nash equilibrium, given the particular structure of
the game, it can be characterized through first-order optimality conditions for a composite
optimal control problem. This is also useful from a computational point of view, as the available
machinery for PDE-constrained optimization can be used for the numerical approximation of the
solution of the control problem. Numerical tests obtained by following this latter approach are
qualitatively consistent with experimental results on related settings.
Overall, the paper is well-written and follows a sound modeling approach. Concerning the
solution of the differential game, resorting to an equivalent optimal control formulation is an
adequate idea as it should open the possibility of addressing higher dimensional problems. As
already mentioned, the computational findings are in according with experimental results
reported in the literature, assessing the appropriateness of the proposed modeling framework.
I recommend this article for publication.

The authors present an agent based method for pedestrian avoidance, which is based on an
optimal control problem. They study the interactions of two agents, which try to minimize a
given cost functional. The dynamics of the agents are governed by FP equations for the respective
PDF functions. The optimal strategy determined by the respective Nash equilibrium. The authors
discuss the existence of such minima and present numerical simulations to illustrate the
dynamics.
I find the manuscript quite interesting, but there are several issues which I think should be
addressed before considering it for publication:
1) The authors do not mention a later work by Hoogendorn and Bovy, in which they consider the
dynamics of pedestrians in the presence of Brownian noise. I think it would be good to discuss
the difference of their model to their approach in more detail.
Hoogendorn, S. and Bovy, P.H.L., Pedestrian route choice and activity scheduling theory and
models,Transportation Research B, 2004
2) I don't believe that the two stochastic processes are independent, since the individuals are
trying to avoid each other. Their dynamics are linked, and so are their PDF. Please discuss this
issue in more detail.
3) The authors do not discuss the role of the final time T - how does it influence the results. I
suppose that it has to be sufficiently large to ensure that there exist controls which satisfy the
upper and lower bound stated for u.
4) What is T in all numerical simulations ? How does it influence the simulations ?
5) What do you choose a PDF function which is quid 'wide-spread' ? (Equation 5.1) I suppose that
the simulation results depend on this initial choice - how do they change if they are more
concentrated ?
6) I find the results of the first test case not very intuitive (Figure 3). I would expect that the
individual moving from the left to the right, would rather step up than down (as shown in Figure
3). Why does it go down ? I also don't see how this result is comparable to the experimental data
(Figure 3e) - could you please clarify this issue.
7) Test Case IV: I would expect that another solution should be the other way around - namely
that player B moves faster and slows down afterwards. Did you observe this in your simulations
as well ?
8) You consider two rather 'extreme' values for rho in your simulations - 0.01 or 150/200. What

responses to the Referees’ comments are given below. (Italic – Referee’s comments, non-

manuscript together with comments on pag. 2 and 4.
further comments, in the following, we refer to the above paper of Hoogendorn and Bovy as
nd to our manuscript as [M].
M], we refer to [HB] and remark that, also in this reference, the dynamics of a pedestrian
elled by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) where the control represents the drift (the
y field). Further, in the revision we remark that also in [HB] the cost functional includes
nt terms concerning, in particular, a benefit function.
ever, the differences in the modelling and purpose between [HB] and [M] are considerable
eir discussion in our manuscript would be beyond the scope of our work. Nevertheless, we
like to address these differences in this response and thus address Remarks 1) and 2) of the
e.
RESPONSE TO THE REFEREES’ REPORTS
The authors do not mention a later work by Hoogendorn and Bovy, in which they consider
the dynamics of pedestrians in the presence of Brownian noise. I think it would be good to
discuss the difference of their model to their approach in more detail.
The first difference between the two settings is that in [HB] a single pedestrian is con-
sidered, while in [M] at least two pedestrian enter in the formulation of the problem and
each is modelled by an independent SDE with its own control function. Another difference
concerning the structure of the SDEs in [HB] and [M] is that in the former reference the
control function (v) represents the entire velocity field of the pedestrian, while in [M] the
drift has a given velocity field (also denoted with v), which corresponds to the deterministic
dynamics of the lone pedestrian, and a control field (u) that represents a deviation from
the given velocity field to perform avoidance.
Next, we address the most relevant differences concerning the cost functionals in [HB]
and [M]. In relation to our last remark above, in [HB] the cost of the control, that is,
the cost of the entire velocity field, is penalized in the L2 norm. On the other hand, in
[M] only the avoidance strategy is penalized in the H 1 norm (guaranteeing a continuous
control). This means that in the [M] framework, the pedestrian is free to (plan to) move
as fast as desired while changes from the desired dynamics are sought that are as small
and regular as possible. Another difference between the two functionals is regarding the
interaction with other pedestrian: in [HB] a function describing the expected number of
interactions with other pedestrian is introduced. This function may provide the position of
other pedestrian at a given time. However, this corresponds to the presence of non-reacting
pedestrian who do not try to avoid the pedestrian modelled by the SDE. On the contrary
in [M], the dynamics of all pedestrian enter in the formulation of the problem and, thanks
to the interaction functional, they are all aware of and solve the avoidance problem.
Finally, notice that the presence of walls (and impenetrable obstacles) are modelled
through reflecting boundary conditions for the FP equations. Further, the convex poten-
tials discussed in [M] are similar in spirit to the benefit function <U+03B3> in [HB].
I don’t believe that the two stochastic processes are independent, since the individuals are
trying to avoid each other. Their dynamics are linked, and so are their PDF. Please discuss
this issue in more detail.
The structure of the SDEs in [M] clearly shows that these SDEs are not coupled. In fact,
the random variable (position) of the pedestrian 1, denoted with X (1) , does not appear in
the SDE of pedestrian 2, whose state is represented by the random variable X (2) . Vice-
versa, X (2) does not appear in the SDE of pedestrian 1. Furthermore, the two pedestrian
are subject to stochastically independent Brownian processes.
The only place where a coupling could take place is through the control functions, as
remarked by the Referee in 2). This would be certainly true in a HJB setting (as in [HB]) as
the feedback controls would depend on the states of the processes, i.e. u = u(X (1) , X (2) , t).
However, in our case the controls depend only on time (u = u(t)) and they result from
solving an open-loop Fokker-Planck (FP) control problem. Indeed, the solution of our FP
RESPONSE TO THE REFEREES’ REPORTS
control problem, which includes an interaction functional, provides deterministic avoidance
strategies that are robust since in the FP framework the ensemble of all possible trajec-
tories is encoded in the probability density function. These control strategies can be (and
are) used for all statistically independent Monte Carlo realizations of the processes.
The authors do not discuss the role of the final time T - how does it influence the results.
I suppose that it has to be sufficiently large to ensure that there exist controls which satisfy
the upper and lower bound stated for u.
We thank the Referee for making this point. It is certainly interesting to compare the
avoidance mechanism for different time horizons. For this reason, in the revision we have
added results of numerical experiments considering the Test Case II for a shorter time inter-
val [0, T ] with T = 1. In this case, as expected, we find that in order to perform avoidance
larger controls are required. In particular, we see that the control bounds become active.
This is in contrast to the case when T = 5, where the controls stay well within the bounds.
This difference is depicted in Figure 6 and discussed in the text.
What is T in all numerical simulations ? How does it influence the simulations ?
The value of T varies for the four test cases. Now, we explicitly specify the value of T
in all the experiments. Its influence on the results of simulation is discussed above.
What do you choose a PDF function which is quite ’wide-spread’ ? (Equation 5.1) I sup-
pose that the simulation results depend on this initial choice - how do they change if they
are more concentrated ?
We have also performed experiments with broader, respectively narrower Gaussians. The
results do not change qualitatively as the evolution of the means of the PDFs remain es-
sentially the same.
I find the results of the first test case not very intuitive (Figure 3). I would expect that
the individual moving from the left to the right, would rather step up than down (as shown
in Figure 3). Why does it go down ? I also don’t see how this result is comparable to the
experimental data (Figure 3e) - could you please clarify this issue.
Intuition is important in validating results of human behaviour and, in our context, we
should keep in mind that avoidance takes place in a multitude of different ways.
In fact, in the first test case, we may argue that the pedestrian moving from left to right
would step down so as to stay clear of the other pedestrian. We believe that this solution
and the one suggested by the Referee result from similar reasoning and in this sense they
are comparable and consistent with the result of the real experiment.
Moreover, notice that the non-uniqueness of the Nash equilibria allows different paths to
be taken by the pedestrian to avoid each other. This is clearly remarked in the text after
RESPONSE TO THE REFEREES’ REPORTS
Lemma 4.2.
Test Case IV: I would expect that another solution should be the other way around - namely
that player B moves faster and slows down afterwards. Did you observe this in your simu-
lations as well ?
Yes, we agree. In fact, starting from a different initial guess for our numerical solution
procedure, we obtain that the Player B moves faster and then slows down. Both results
are possible due to the non-uniqueness of Nash equilibria.
You consider two rather ’extreme’ values for rho in your simulations - 0.01 or 150/200.
What happens in the case of intermediate values ?
We have gathered experience with <U+03C1> ranging from 0.01 to 200, considering values like 0.1,
5, 30, 50, 100. For values till 5, we observe collision whereas for higher values avoidance
takes place. In our experiments, we choose these two extreme values to point out the two
distinct cases of non-avoidance and avoidance.
