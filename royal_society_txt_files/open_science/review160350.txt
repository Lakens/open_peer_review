Review:
This paper combines extensive molecular and morphological datasets for the Asian golden cat
with smaller but comparative datasets for the Bornean bay cat in order to review the evolutionary
history of these taxa at both inter- and intra-specific levels.
The analyses conducted are appropriate and comprehensive, resulting in a convincing pattern of
molecular and morphological variation throughout the Asian golden cat distribution, as well as
insights into the variation of bay cats.
The molecular data in particular represents a significant amount of work in the generation and
analysis of whole mtDNA genomes form multiple archived samples.
The paper is very well constructed, easy to understand and the standard of English is high
throughout, although some grammatical/usage errors are present.
The paper will be of interest to a broad range of scientists working on felids, Southeast Asian
biogeography and evolutionary reconstruction. It is also a potentially important contribution to
the conservation management of the focal species. I would therefore be happy to recommend the
paper for submission once the authors have had the opportunity to consider and address my
remarks below.
Major comment
The pelage results for the bay cat are interesting as, following the authors’ argument for the Asian
golden cat, the results do seem to suggest that the bay cat was exposed to / adapted to multiple
environmental conditions. However the authors’ state throughout that the bay cat is an evergreen
forest specialist and hence was less able to adapt to environmental change. If pelage variation
does imply selection for different habitat types, then the implication is that the bay cat may not
have been restricted to the tropical evergreen habitat postulated in the distribution analysis.
Which in turn has implications for the hypothesized speciation event and the overall narrative
regarding restricted bay cat distribution during the LGM.
Can the authors please provide some comment or explanation to this point as there appears to be
some contradiction between the data and its interpretation in the two species.

The conclusions of the paper seem generally well justified. I cannot follow the argumentation of
the authors regarding "multiple colonization events on Sumatra". There are two clear-cut clades,
one containing all Sumatran samples plus the one from Peninsular Malaysia, and I fail to see how
this can provide evidence for multiple colonization events of Sumatra since the Toba eruption.
The evidence of the "tree-like pattern of Sumatran samples in the haplotype network" is at best
circumstantial. In a similar vein, "the sample from Peninsular Malaysia, which is genetically
positioned between samples from Mainland Indochina and those from Sumatra", is the basal-
most branch in the Sumatra clade, which is consistent with a colonization of Sumatra from the
North, but in the absence of more samples from Malaysia this is all that can be said about this, I
believe. I would urge the authors to rephrase these two section of the discussion and back down a
bit on the "multiple colonization" scenario. One minor issue here: I do not see the point of mid-
point rooting - please root the tree in Fig 3 using the bay cat as outgroup. And how can a single
tree be reconstructed using both ML and BI, as the caption implies? Finally, one last minor point:
when referring to museum samples (Fig. S2), please cite them using the full museum accession

*** We agree that our phrasing has been misleading. In contrast to the Asiatic golden cat the
colour morphs of the Bay cat are less distinctive and represent more a gradient from reddish
to greyish. We also think that all three colour variants of the bay cat are actually associated
with closed evergreen forests and red, brown and greyish black are all colourations which
provide in a darker shaded environment a better camouflage. In contrast the much brighter
reddish and spotted Asiatic golden cat morph are clearly adaptations to more open forest
conditions. We have therefore rephrased the discussion about the bay cat to avoid and
confusion here. This section reads now:
L384-391: “For the bay cat, three different coat colours (red, brown and greyish black) have
been recorded intermixed from different regions of Borneo. In contrast to the Asiatic golden
cat’s coat colour morphs, which are highly contrasting and distinctive, the bay cat’s
polymorphism is tonally neutral. Close examination of the pelage of the greyish black morphs
show an underlying reddish coloration (e.g., FMNH 8378) and we suspect that some
individuals may change coloration during their lives as has been recorded for the
polymorphic African golden cat, Caracal aurata (Pocock, 1907). Given that most of the bay
cat’s likely mammalian predators and prey have dichromatic vision, this means that these
colour variants are not visually distinct from each other, especially in the low light levels of
closed-canopy forests. Therefore, this observation supports the species distribution
projections, which suggested that the bay cat has likely been restricted to more homogenous
evergreen rainforests during the Plio- and Pleistocene. In contrast the brighter Asiatic golden
cat morphs could be seen as an adaptation to open deciduous forests.”
FMNH 8378 – photos above show full colour and mixture of red and greyish black
coloration. Photos below show same imags with colour removed so that red and greyish
black appear tonally similar.

***L 59-62 we added this information and the sentence reads now:
In particular the Sunda Shelf which comprises Peninsular, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Bali and
other smaller islands is of great interest to evolutionary biologists [1], as alternating glacial
and interglacial periods resulted in the emergence and submergence of land bridges between
the larger landmasses [2–4].

Therefore these data cannot be integrated in this manuscript. We added however the reference
to the unpublished data in the manuscript (JH Mazák and ACK unpublished data).

The conclusions of the paper seem generally well justified. I cannot follow the argumentation
of the authors regarding "multiple colonization events on Sumatra". There are two clear-cut
clades, one containing all Sumatran samples plus the one from Peninsular Malaysia, and I fail
to see how this can provide evidence for multiple colonization events of Sumatra since the
Toba eruption. The evidence of the "tree-like pattern of Sumatran samples in the haplotype
network" is at best circumstantial. In a similar vein, "the sample from Peninsular Malaysia,
which is genetically positioned between samples from Mainland Indochina and those from
Sumatra", is the basal-most branch in the Sumatra clade, which is consistent with a
colonization of Sumatra from the North, but in the absence of more samples from Malaysia
this is all that can be said about this, I believe. I would urge the authors to rephrase these two
section of the discussion and back down a bit on the "multiple colonization" scenario.
***The position of the Malaysian sample changed, depending on the rooting and the
network. The new tree rooted with the bay cat show that this sample is positioned between
samples from Mainland Indochina and Sumatra. This does not contradict that it is the basal-
most branch to all Sumatran samples. We have clarified this by referring to the network and
figure 3. This sentence reads now:
L349-353 “A probable post-Toba expansion of Asian golden cats from southern China and
northern Indochina, areas which were less or not affected by Toba, is also supported by the
sample from Peninsular Malaysia, which is the basal-most branch of the Sundaic clade and
based on the network (Figure S1) and phylogenetic tree (Figure 3) genetically positioned
between samples from Mainland Indochina and those from Sumatra.”
We also agree that in the absence of additional samples from Peninsular Malaysia it is
difficult to conclude the “multiple colonizations”. We still think that a single colonisation
event would likely have resulted in a much more star-like pattern of the Sumatran samples,
however we agree that the found pattern could have also been explained by a directional e.g.
north-to-south expansion of golden cats in Sumatra. Therefore we have rephrased this section
and it reads now:
L361-367 “The tree-like pattern of the Sumatran samples in the haplotype network (Fig. S1)
indicated either a directional north-to-south expansion of golden cats after a single
colonization. However, multiple colonizations events on Sumatra from the Peninsular
Malaysia cannot be excluded. To test these scenarios additional samples from Peninsular
Malaysia and from Sumatra with precise locality information would be needed. A haplotype
radiation from a few founders in Central Sumatra would have resulted in a star-like pattern
[51] and is thus rather unlikely.”
Minor comment
outgroup.
***We changed the rooting of the phylogenetic tree in Figure 3 and used the Bay cat as an
outgroup
How can a single tree be reconstructed using both ML and BI, as the caption implies?
*** L638 RaXML and MrBayes had identical topologies. The shown phylogenetic tree is
based on RaXML. We have edited the Figure 3 caption and it reads now:
“Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree derived from Asian golden cat mitogenomes using
the Bay cat (Catopuma badia) as outgroup. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree provided
identical topologies. Support values for nodes were obtained from ML analysis (RaXML) and
Bayesian inference (MrBayes). Only values > 80% (RaXML) and > 0.9 (posterior probability
values for Bayesian trees) are shown. Smaller values are denoted with *. Haplotypes and their
origins is listed separately (additional file 1).”
Finally, one last minor point: when referring to museum samples (Fig. S2), please cite them
using the full museum accession numbers including the institutional acronym, not just part of
the number calling it "specimen ID" - this should read, e.g., ZMB Mam. 91060...
***L 670 Figure S2, We added full museum accession numbers including the institutional
acronyms. It now reads as
