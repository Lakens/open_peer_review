I think the anatomical and behavioural observations presented here are splendidly visualized and
carefully detailed, and will represent a fantastic addition to the literature. I only recommend a
couple minor revisions, primarily stylistic.
In the results section, a few points of discussion are raised, including in lines 113, 126-128, 158,
and 171-173, which may be more appropriately placed in the discussion section.
The paper paints a dichotomy between otariids and phocines, but I think this paper could bear
greater significance with a very brief mention of the general forelimb morphology of monachines,
and the possible implications for the (presumed) shared morphologies between monachines and
otarioids.
In Table S2, the columns headings are confusing (are they of different widths?)

This manuscript describes how to seals hold and eat prey, and suggests that the early pinnipeds
fed like modern seals. The description is clear. Provided good movie, illustrations and figures
made the argument strong.
As such, this work is certainly worth publishing in Royal Society Open Science.

My only concern is no-mention of one of three pinniped families, Odobenidae (walruses). If put
walruses information into the figure 2, the work will be completed. This is not essential, but
might be important.

Response to Referees
Associate Editor
Comment 1:
The reviews for your manuscript describing the eating habits of ancient seal ancestors are in and are
notably positive. I am in agreement with the comments of the reviewers and would like to see each
of the short reviews fully addressed. I agree with both reviewers that the addition of information on
a wider phylogeny would be beneficial to your readers.
Author’s Response:
Thank you for the extremely favourable assessment of our manuscript.
We agree that adding some additional discussion that places these results within a wider phylogenetic
context is useful and so have added two new paragraphs in the discussion to address the points raised
by both referees (see below). However, we have decided not to add additional species to the
phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 because these discussion points are somewhat tangential to the main
contention of our article, which is that ancient seals share similar anatomy to phocine seals and so likely
fed in a similar way. The anatomy and behaviour of walrus and southern phocids has little bearing on
this point, and so we feed it would be a distraction away from our main argument if added to the figures.
Referee 1
Comment 2:
In the results section, a few points of discussion are raised, including in lines 113, 126-128, 158, and
171-173, which may be more appropriately placed in the discussion section.
Author’s Response:
We disagree that these four points should be moved from the results and feel that they help to add clarity
to our arguments by making this section easier to follow.
The first two points both describe results that are clearly illustrated in figures 1 and 2, and so we think
are perfectly appropriate to maintain in the results section:
“The anatomy of the phocine paw is less derived than the otariid flipper: otariid forelimb digits are
integrated to form a stiff, wing-like flipper, whereas phocine digits are distinct and mobile (Figure
1a-b).”
“These features are typical of terrestrial carnivorans (e.g., the wolverine Gulo gulo), and so likely
represent the ancestral condition inherited by the earliest pinnipeds from their last obligate
terrestrial ancestors (Figure 2b).”
The second two points are more minor, but do not fit into the broader arguments presented in the
discussion section. Rather than removing them completely, we think they are better left in the results
section:
“Processing performance appeared to depend on individual levels of experience.”
“This difference may be related to the age and size of the individuals, with the harbour
seals being larger (Table S1) and hence presumably able to swallow bigger pieces of prey.”
Comment 3:
The paper paints a dichotomy between otariids and phocines, but I think this paper could bear greater
significance with a very brief mention of the general forelimb morphology of monachines, and the
possible implications for the (presumed) shared morphologies between monachines and otarioids.
Author’s Response:
To address this point, we have added an additional short section discussing the similarities in behaviour
and anatomy between monachines and otarioids:
“Fur seals and sea lions with flipper-like forelimbs instead usually grip prey in their teeth
before shaking or thrashing their food at the water’s surface [8, 9]. This behaviour is also
used by some southern phocids (monchines) including leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx)
and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) [31, 32]. Interestingly, monachines appear to
be converging on otariid-like forelimb morphology, which may explain why they no longer
use their reduced claws to secure prey during processing [33].”
We have refrained from going further into this discussion here, because we also have a new manuscript
currently in preparation directly addressing the question of convergence in morphology and behaviour
between otariids and monachine seals. We hope to submit this new manuscript in the coming months,
so more discussion on this question will be available very soon.
Comment 4:
In Table S2, the columns headings are confusing (are they of different widths?)
Author’s Response:
Thank you for picking up on this. It appears to be a formatting error that was introduced when I
converted the Word document to build the PDF. I have re-formatted that table and re-exported the PDF
which now looks ok.

Comment 5:
This manuscript describes how to seals hold and eat prey, and suggests that the early pinnipeds fed
like modern seals. The description is clear. Provided good movie, illustrations and figures made the
argument strong. As such, this work is certainly worth publishing in Royal Society Open Science.
My only concern is no-mention of one of three pinniped families, Odobenidae (walruses). If put
walruses information into the figure 2, the work will be completed. This is not essential, but might
be important.
Author’s Response:
To address this point, we have added an additional paragraph discussing the anatomy and behaviour of
walruses:
“In addition to otariids and monachines, this trend towards increasing aquatic specialisation of the
forelimb is also present walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) the sole surviving member of the pinniped
family Odobenidae. Like otariids, walruses have reduced claws and cartilage extending each of
their digits [34]. Walruses use their broad flippers to push water, both during swimming and,
somewhat surprisingly, to fan sediment-free water in front of their faces to help them see the seafloor
while searching for buried shellfish [35, 36]. Species with flipper-like forelimbs may still be able to
hold prey by squeezing it between their flat palms [e.g., 9, 37], but this is likely a less effective way
to secure prey compared to the phocine method of gripping and piercing prey using strong claws.”
As mentioned above, we have decided not to include walrus in Figure 2 to avoid adding complications
that do not directly relate to the question of how the earliest seals likely fed.
Additional changes
In addition to the changes suggested by the referees, we have also added an additional funder at the end
of the article, and we fixed a minor error in the caption of Figure 3 where a photo of a grey seal was
miss-labelled as being of a harbour seal.
