This work studies a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model in a meta-population
framework with mobility. The results show how spatial fragmentation and mobility play roles in
the persistence of the disease.
The manuscript is well-structured and scientifically sound in its present form. It's almost ready
for publication, just some minor points should be revised/modified.
1) It's not mentioned according to which algorithm the power law networks are generated.
2) It's not mentioned how initial seeds are distributed on patches. Do they have also a power law
distribution similarly?
3) Is the Fig. 7. averaged over realizations? or it's just one single run? All the averaged plots over
realizations must include the error bars.
4) There are some typos in bibliography.
5) It's also good to mention what is expected intuitively in the case of larger and smaller basic
reproductive number in the final discussions.

In general, meta-population modelling of epidemics is a very powerful and realistic approach to
explore the critical behaviour and possible outcomes of spreading processes evolving in a
population where agents live in meta-populations (cities) and are able to travel between them.
3
Earlier studies has shown that the construction of the meta-population network (determining the
possible travels between cities) determine the concentration of agents in meta-populations and as
well the critical behaviour of the ongoing epidemic process. This work builds on these
advancements but considerably extend them by modelling pathogens which are able to mutate
thus re-infect agents who have been recovered from an earlier infection. To capture reinfection
the authors study the SIRS model where a parameter (\lambda) controls the length of immunity
period (L) of recovered agents. They measure the persistence of the epidemic (the probability of a
process to reach the endemic state) as the function of L and the mobility parameter p to
understand how the spatial structure, coded in the meta-population network plays a role in the
final outcome of the process.
The authors concluded via results obtained from large scale numerical simulations that the
process dynamics exhibits three distinct regime in terms of mobility. In the first regime where the
mobility is limited the network behaves as the meta-populations would be isolated, while for
large mobility paramters the system appears as it would be single network without meta-
populations. The most interesting observations were found for intermediate values of the
mobility parameter p, where the coupled meta-populations enhance the re-injection of epidemics
into already recovered populations which maximise the overall persistence of the ongoing
spreading. In addition they also explored the effects of different population sizes and cases of
different network structures.
Minor comments:
- The authors may discuss briefly the effects of different ways of interventions as vaccinations,
quarantines, or reduction in travelling (removing links from the meta-population network). They
made it clear not to address the effects of seasonality but it would help the reader if they could
elaborate more on the expected behaviour in this case.
- I am aware that the analytical treatment of this model is difficult, but it would be great if the
authors could somewhat more formally define their model by providing the dynamical rate
equations of the process. This has been done for other simple epidemic models as SIS and SIR on
meta-population networks thus I believe it would be a simple extension of these frameworks to
consider the SIRS spreading scheme.

We would like to thank both reviewers for their constructive comments and
recommendation that helped us to improve the paper. We provide here below a
detail reply to the points raised.
Reviewer: 1
1) It's not mentioned according to which algorithm the power law networks are
generated.
We included this information adding the following sentence in the methods section:
The nodes' degree distribution is assumed to be of the form P(k) ~ k^(-gamma) with
no degree-degree correlation present – a random network with these characteristics
was generated by means of the uncorrelated configuration model (Catanzaro et al.
PRE 2005) with gamma=3.0
2) It's not mentioned how initial seeds are distributed on patches. Do they have also
a power law distribution similarly?
All infectious individuals at the beginning of the simulations are distributed in a single
seeding patch that is randomly selected at each run. We made this clearer in the text
and the sentence now reads:
Starting with a fully susceptible population, the disease is seeded in a randomly
chosen node by infecting 0.5% of its population, in such a way that stochastic runs
differ for both the initial seed and the stochastic realisation of the dynamics
3) Is the Fig. 7. averaged over realizations? or it's just one single run? All the
averaged plots over realizations must include the error bars.
Figure 7 was recovered from a single stochastic realization. We made this clear in
the text and the caption of the figure. Averaged quantities are shown only in Figure 6
b), d) and f). Given the large number of curves displayed on each panel we decided
not to show the error bars to avoid confusion.
4) There are some typos in bibliography.
Corrected
5) It's also good to mention what is expected intuitively in the case of larger and
smaller basic reproductive number in the final discussions.
We added the following sentence to the Conclusion:
In order to better focus the analysis to the interplay between mobility and time scale
of waning of immunity, we considered throughout the manuscript a single value of
R_0. We expect different values of R_0 yielding the same qualitative picture with an
increase in the parameter determining a shift of the persistence peak toward smaller
values of p as predicted by Eq. 3.1.
Minor comments:
- The authors may discuss briefly the effects of different ways of interventions as
vaccinations, quarantines, or reduction in travelling (removing links from the meta-
population network). They made it clear not to address the effects of seasonality but
it would help the reader if they could elaborate more on the expected behaviour in
this case.
In order to discuss more in depth the role of seasonality we mentioned in the
discussion some results from the literature of childhood diseases that could be
relevant also in the present case:
The inclusion of seasonality in the studies of childhood diseases and its interplay with
demography showed the emergence of annual and biannual cycles in the dynamics
of the disease (Marguta et al. 2015, Grenfell et al. 2001, Marguta et al. 2016).
We included, in addition, an entire paragraph in the Conclusion to address possible
effects of interventions
Other aspects could alter the results, such as human response and intervention to
the epidemic -- e.g. vaccination, case isolation, travel restrictions. In particular,
phenomena like travel bans or spontaneous reductions of travels often occur during
the initial stage of an outbreak as a consequence of the public concern about the
emerging infection. They were shown, however, to have limited impact on the early
stage invasion (Meloni et al. 2011), given that reductions of orders of magnitude
needed to significantly affect spatial spread are unfeasible in reality (Hollingsworth et
al 2006, Poletto et al 2014). For the same reason we argue that their effect would be
minimal also on pathogen persistence, unless the system is in the intermediate
mobility regime, where probability of persistence is more sensitive to the level of
spatial coupling (Figure 2). Vaccination, on the other hand, by boosting the level of
immunity in the population increases the chance of pathogen extinction and may
profoundly alter the spreading dynamics, affecting the frequency of epidemic waves
(Grenfell et al. 2001). For the case of rapidly mutating pathogens the quantification of
vaccine efficacy and its impact on disease eradication is made complicated by the
fact that immunity caused by vaccination also decays in time when novel virus
variants emerge, and vaccine match with the circulating pathogen is often
compromised due to the difficulty in anticipating virus mutation in the vaccine design
and production (Bedford et al 2014).
- I am aware that the analytical treatment of this model is difficult, but it would be
great if the authors could somewhat more formally define their model by providing
the dynamical rate equations of the process. This has been done for other simple
epidemic models as SIS and SIR on meta-population networks thus I believe it would
be a simple extension of these frameworks to consider the SIRS spreading scheme.
We added rate equations of the combined infection and traveling dynamics as
suggested by the reviewer.
