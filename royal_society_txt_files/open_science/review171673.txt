• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Please note that we cannot publish your manuscript without these end statements included. We
have included a screenshot example of the end statements for reference. If you feel that a given
heading is not relevant to your paper, please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state
that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 01-Nov-2017). If you do not
think you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
3
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Manoj Srinivasan):
The authors have mostly thoughtfully responded to the various reviewer comments (transferred
from the previous journal), while more clearly stating the limitations of the work. In response to
reviewer 4's comments, the authors have provided a very nice figure in their response: plotting
propulsive force vs step length from two different papers using two different protocols (page 5 of
37 of their pdf submission). I would encourage the authors to include this figure in the article,
referring to it in their Discussion sub-section titled "Step length changes".

mments to the Author
authors have mostly thoughtfully responded to the various reviewer comments (transferred
m the previous journal), while more clearly stating the limitations of the work. In response to
iewer 4's comments, the authors have provided a very nice figure in their response: plotting
pulsive force vs step length from two different papers using two different protocols (page 5 of
of their pdf submission). I would encourage the authors to include this figure in the article,
rring to it in their Discussion sub-section titled "Step length changes".
thank the editor for their comment. As suggested, we have added Figure 5, showing
nge in propulsive force versus change in step length, to our revised manuscript. We now
erence this new figure in our discussion section on Line 368: “Conversely, we found here
t increasing FP by 20% yielded a much more subtle 6% increase in step length (Fig. 5).”
copy the updated figure and caption below.
gure 5: Group mean percent (%) change in peak propulsive force versus percent (%)
nge in step length from Experiment 2, plotted against data adapted from Martin and
rsh (1992). We found that subjects increased (decreased) their step lengths by 6.6% (-
%) when targeting a 20% increase

mally. Conversely, Martin and Marsh
92) found that their subjects increased
creased) FP by only 12.2% (-13.0%)
en directly increasing (decreasing) their
p lengths by 10.2% (-7.9%). These results
ply that, although both change
ultaneously, modifying propulsive forces
not biomechanically equivalent to
difying step lengths. Accordingly, we
erpret our findings to allude to direct
cts of modulating push-off intensity and
solely a result of secondary changes in
p length.”
