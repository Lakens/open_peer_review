The authors present the effect of cells and struts sizes on the force displacement response of an
elastomeric structure consisting of an array of cells with square shape cross sections. They show
that the structure with a 9x9 pattern of cells provides the highest force for a given global
displacement of the structure, followed by the 5x5 and 3x3 structures. Local strains at strut level
are analysed by DIC and compared to the strain fields obtained by finite element simulations of
the experiment. In addition, a fixture system is described that enables the structures to freely
reduce in width when uniaxially extended.
In general, the study is well described but a few details are missing in the methods section, and
some of the results are presented in a way that makes their comparison and quantitative
assessment difficult. Moreover, some conclusions seem not quite justified by the results and their
description given. Most critically, however, the manuscript misses a discussion of the results, and
in particular, an explanation of the observed stiffening effect.
Detailed comments:
#1 The authors call the observed behavior “nonlinear scaling effects in the stiffness”. Could they
be more precise in specifying which quantities exactly are related by the non-linear scaling
law(s)?
#2 The paper misses an explanation of the observed effect although the experimental and
computational analyses would probably allow this. At least a hypothesis on the cause of the
structural effect should be formulated, and analyses for validation/rejection should be
performed. For example, it could be interesting to compare with the response of a continuous
structure of identical cross section area.
#3 At several points, the authors report that the effect would not be visible in the “small strain
regime” or for “infinitesimal strain theory” (e.g. p. 1 l. 47, p. 2 l. 47, p.6 , l. 47). However, both the
experiments in Fig. 5 but particularly the simulations in Fig. 11 indicate differences in the initial
slope of the force-displacement curves, i.e. for small strains (even if hard to assess from the given
representation of the data). The claim should thus be reconsidered and be either revised or
substantiated by a more appropriate analysis of the data.
#4 It seems that each experiment (3x3, 5x5 and 9x9) was only conducted once, i.e. n=1. Although
the use of a commercial silicone suggests little variations, a reasonable number of repetitions and
statistical assessment would reveal how large the differences between the structures are
compared to their own variability due to, e.g., fabrication.
#5 Fig. 9 seems not in agreement with the text on p. 5 ls. 22-24: The figure reports “microstrain”,
the text refers to “mean vertical strain” or “certain maximum vertical displacement”.
#6 The order of stiffness and strain magnitude is reported in a confusing way, beginning with the
5x5 structure rather than ordering by increasing/decreasing values. This could be improved.
3
#7 p. 5 ls. 26-35: There are three principal strains, do the authors refer to maximum principal
strain?
#8 Figs. 6-8 would better be presented together in one figure to see the evolution of the strain
field. The scale bars are not readable.
#9 The authors report “excellent agreement” between experiment and FE simulations on p. 6, l.9
for the 9x9 and 5x5 structures. The agreement seems fair but there are noticeable deviations in the
moderate strain regime (Fig. 11) that need a critical discussion, in particular considering the high
degree of definition of this system in terms of material properties and boundary conditions.
#10 It is not clear why the curves in Fig. 11 do not all cross the origin.
#11 The description of the FE simulations misses details: What kind of elements were used in the
FE study? Was near-incompressibility assumed? If yes, how was this implemented?
#12 What is the force level associated with Fig. 12? What are the units in Figs. 9b, 10 (probably
per cent) and how do they relate to the scale bars in Fig. 12. There is a factor of 1000 between the
scale bars.
#13 More details on the following points in the materials and methods section would be helpful:
What was the material of the molds used to cast the structures?
How were Young’s modulus and Poisson's ratio determined (p. 3 l. 16)?
What method is used (by the software) to compute strains from displacements (p. 3 l. 59)?
It should be indicated that “Snazaroo” is a manufacturer/brand name.
The specifications of the “three different camera set-ups” should be given (p. 4 l. 13). Were they
differing in terms of lenses?
Is the “Imetrum video strain gauge” (p. 4 l. 37) part of the Instra4D software mentioned before?

The article written by Wyatt et all. studies a nonlinear scaling effect in the stiffness of soft cellular
structures. They study using experimental and numerical simulations three cellular structure
with square holes, where each structure has a different number of holes. The article is clearly
written, but unfortunately, I believe that the conclusions of an existing nonlinear scaling effect in
stiffness is based on wrong assumptions and the experimental setup, so that with the current
experiments and simulations they don't provide any evidence of this. In fact, I do not see any
reason for a nonlinear scaling effect to exist, as the strains throughout the structure are not
sufficient to result in any nonlinear geometrical effects such as buckling. Below some additional
comments on which I base my conclusions:
1) Each structure tested has a size of 100x100 mmm, with additional beams that connect the
structure to the boundary. For the 3x3 cell structure, the length of these struts is approximately
25mm, so that two additional spring with a volume of 3*25*25/3=25*25 is used (where 25/3 is the
thickness of the beams). For the 5x5 cell structure these additional springs have a volume of
5*15*15/3=25*15, and for the 9x9 structure these two additional springs have a volume of
9*8.33*8.33/3=25*8.33. Thus, the more unit cells used in the cellular structure, the stiffer the total
additional springs that has been used to connect the structure to the boundary. For example, the
stiffness of the additional spring connecting the cellular solid to the boundary equals
k=AE/L=Lz*t*E/L, which for the 3x3, 5x5, 9x9 structure are all equal to k=LzE/3. However, as
there are 3 beams for the 3x3 structure, 5 beams for the 5x5 structure and 9 beams for the 9x9
structure, the stiffness increases linearly with the number of cells. Therefore, I expect that the
change in the stress-strain data comes from the effect of boundary conditions.
2) The authors claim the Finite Element Analysis shows also the non-linear scaling, but the
authors have modeled exactly the same setup as in the experiments, so that also here the
boundary conditions are important and probably are the cause of the nonlinear scaling. While the
authors have applied symmetry conditions in the horizontal direction, to fully check the scaling
of the cell size the authors should have used periodic boundary conditions on all sides, so that
only a Representative Volume Element has to be modeled (effectively simulating an infinitely
large lattice). Given that simulations for these structures are often normalised by length and
stiffness, even in the non-linear case, I do not expect any nonlinear scaling to occur, so that the
stiffness does not change with cell size, as long as the same amount of material is used and the
relative sizes are kept the same.
3) The authors also claim that for small deformations, the results doe not depend on cell size, but
looking closely at e.g. figure 5 shows that the stiffness is already different from the initial loading.
Can the authors plot the effective stiffness to check this?
4) In the introduction, the authors mention that "this behaviour is also predicted by finite element
simulations [14,15,22]", and make this sentence sound like the behaviour has been observed
before in Finite Element Simulations, while the reference only refer to general Finite Element
Analysis implementations.
5) If it turns out that the stiffness does scale nonlinearly with the cell size, I would be very
interested in the reason for this? Can the authors provide argumentation or a physical effect for
this. Also, for is there a limit on how stiff the structures can become, and for which cell size
would this be reached?

The authors are trying to analyze the effect of large strains on varying cell sizes and overall
stiffness response. Their studies involve a structure with 3x3, 5x5, and 9x9 cells. The results are
interesting and the authors should address the comments listed below.
-Finite element analysis lacks details on mesh information (total number of nodes and elements)
and meshing of the sample overall (number of elements throughout the thickness versus along
other dimensions.
-Details about the DIC settings should be provided in processing images to compute
displacements and strains. Also, the resolution of the strain field from the DIC measurements
should be given.
-authors state that the differences in figure 5 may be attributed to changes in mixture ratio to
create the silicone. For an experiment such as this, one may expect the same material being
used/mixed for all samples. Another listed reason is temperature, but silicone is not very
10
sensitive to temperature changes, unless it is significant and would not be expected to happen
here.
-There are several problems with the statement “… that the stiffness in cell walls made from an
isotropic nonlinear hyperplastic material increases when the number of cells…” made by the
authors. One is that the stiffness in cell walls does not change, but the overall stiffness of the
entire structure. Second is that the term “stiffness” is a vague term for nonlinear behavior and
should be precisely defined in this context. Third is that the stiffness only changes at large
deformations and not small deformations and has not been explicitly written in the conclusion in
that same sentence.
-Looking at Figure 5, there are big variations between the samples used for the 9x9 structure
(solid versus dashed curve) and for the 3x3 samples. The difference for the 5x5 curve is minimal
though. If the difference in curves for the 5x5 structure were significant, the entire analysis in this
manuscript would be inconclusive.
-The authors stated that from past studies the stiffness at small deformations did not change with
the cell size. Looking at figure 5 and figure 9, it appears to have some changes for small
deformations as well.

Appendix A
Nonlinear scaling effects in the stiffness of soft cellular
structures
Responses to Referees
Hayley Wyatt (on behalf of all authors)
We thank the Editor and the Referees for their constructive and careful feed-back on
our research paper entitled "Nonlinear scaling effects in the stiffness of soft cellular
structures" submitted for publication to Royal Society Open Science (RSOS). We have
revised the manuscript taking into consideration their recommendations and
included below our detailed responses to their comments. Our responses and the
corresponding changes in the revised paper appear in blue colour.
Responses (R1.x) to Comments (C1.x) from Referee 1
C1.1. The authors call the observed behavior “nonlinear scaling effects in the
stiffness”. Could they be more precise in specifying which quantities exactly are
related by the non-linear scaling law(s)?
C1.2. The paper misses an explanation of the observed effect although the
experimental and computational analyses would probably allow this. At least a
hypothesis on the cause of the structural effect should be formulated, and analyses
for validation/rejection should be performed. For example, it could be interesting to
compare with the response of a continuous structure of identical cross section area.
R1.1.-R1.2. We thank the Referee for these comments. First of all, we note that, for
different cellular structures with linear elastic cell walls, containing the same volume
of solid material, which is distributed either as a small number of large cells or as a
larger number of smaller cells, when the ratio between the thickness and the length
of a wall is the same, the stiffness of the corresponding structure would be the same
[10]. This behaviour appears reasonable for similar structures with nonlinear elastic
cell walls under small strains as well. However, in real structures, under sufficiently
large strains, the cell size is expected to have a more independent effect, even though
this effect may be relatively minor or harder to separate from other mechanical
responses [1,26].
The scope of our paper is to separate the cell size effect from other nonlinear
mechanical responses when the size of the cells and the size of the structure are
comparable (i.e. the cells are not infinitesimally small relative to the cellular sample).
Specifically, for cellular structures with uniform cell size, shape, and distribution, we
demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the stiffness in cell walls made
from an isotropic nonlinear hyperelastic material increases when the number of cells
increases while the volume of solid material and the ratio between the thickness and
the length of the wall remain fixed. Additional analysis was conducted on the FEA
models to understand this behaviour. Within the paper an additional section (5c) and
an additional figure, Figure 11, have been added. This analysis shows that the cell
joints exhibit a different nonlinear behaviour when compared to the cell walls, this is
thought to be due to additional constraints. Therefore when there are more joints
present within a structure you change the overall response of the structure. The
difference in response between the joints and walls is not seen within the small strain
regime, but is instead seen at larger deformations. In addition to the finite element
results presented in this paper, the computational and theoretical results published
by our group in [17,19] also confirm this nonlinear elastic effect.
We have now emphasised that the aim of the present paper is not to make the cell
size go to zero, as it would be the case for a continuous structure, but rather to
separate the cell size effect from other nonlinear effects when the size of the cells
and the size of the structure are comparable.
C1.3. At several points, the authors report that the effect would not be visible in the
“small strain regime” or for “infinitesimal strain theory” (e.g. p. 1 l. 47, p. 2 l. 47, p. 6
l. 47). However, both the experiments in Fig. 5 but particularly the simulations in Fig.
11 indicate differences in the initial slope of the force-displacement curves, i.e. for
small strains (even if hard to assess from the given representation of the data). The
claim should thus be reconsidered and be either revised or substantiated by a more
appropriate analysis of the data.
R1.3. The differences seen in Figures 5 and 11 are caused by the variation in the
overall size of the specimen due to the loading tabs and therefore the data is not
representative of strain between the different specimens. The data within Figure 6
and 7(b) show the difference in strain between the different specimens. Within both
of these figures, there is very little difference within the strains of the cell walls in the
small strain regime (typically this is classified as below 4% or 40 mstrain). Figure 7b,
shows the strain within the cell walls beginning to vary at approx. 15%. Please see
also our response R1.2.
C1.4. It seems that each experiment (3x3, 5x5 and 9x9) was only conducted once, i.e.
n=1. Although the use of a commercial silicone suggests little variations, a reasonable
number of repetitions and statistical assessment would reveal how large the
differences between the structures are compared to their own variability due to, e.g.,
fabrication.
R1.4. We thank the Referee for this suggestion. Additional specimens were
manufactured for testing, one for each structure type taking the number of
specimens tested to 2, n=2. The authors accept this is a limitation of the current study,
and the additional tests did show some variation within the data, however, all
structures tested found the same trend, with the 9x9 structure always been stiffer
than the 5x5 which in turn was always stiffer than the 3x3 structure demonstrating
the effect or trend the paper is based upon. The text has been modified to reflect this
additional testing, and reasons for the variation within the data are now discussed.
We would also like to point out that:
<U+F0B7> In addition to the finite element results shown in this paper, preliminary
computational results published by our group in [17,19] also indicate a similar
behaviour.
<U+F0B7> Moreover, a statistical analysis is possible only if sufficient experimental data
are available, with more samples being required. Our group is currently
developing stochastic approaches which we hope to incorporate in our future
work in due course (see Mihai LA, Woolley TE, Goriely A. 2018. Stochastic
isotropic hyperelastic materials: constitutive calibration and model selection,
Proceedings of the Royal Society A 474, 20170858). However, this is beyond
the immediate scope of our current paper.
C1.5. Fig. 9 seems not in agreement with the text on p. 5 ls. 22-24: The figure reports
“microstrain”, the text refers to “mean vertical strain” or “certain maximum vertical
displacement”.
C1.6. The order of stiffness and strain magnitude is reported in a confusing way,
beginning with the 5x5 structure rather than ordering by increasing/decreasing
values. This could be improved.
R1.5.-R1.6. The text on p. 5 was modified to reflect the terminology used within Figure
9, namely Lagrange axial strain. Additionally, the text was modified to report the
strain magnitude in decreasing values to make the presentation of the results clearer.
C1.7. p. 5 ls. 26-35: There are three principal strains, do the authors refer to maximum
principal strain?
R1.7. The authors were referring to the maximum principal strain on p.5 ls 26-25. The
text has been modified to clarify this.
C1.8. Figs. 6-8 would better be presented together in one figure to see the evolution
of the strain field. The scale bars are not readable.
R1.8. The Figures were combined to be included in one Figure as suggested.
Additionally, the scale bars were enlarged, with fewer increments included, and text
was made larger to improve the clarity. Figure numbers were modified to reflect
these changes.
C1.9. The authors report “excellent agreement” between experiment and FE
simulations on p. 6, l.9 for the 9x9 and 5x5 structures. The agreement seems fair but
there are noticeable deviations in the moderate strain regime (Fig. 11) that need a
critical discussion, in particular considering the high degree of definition of this
system in terms of material properties and boundary conditions.
R1.9. The statement was changed to read ‘general agreement’, following the
recommendation. An additional paragraph was added to this section of the paper to
discuss possible reasons for the differences between the experimental data and finite
element simulations.
C1.10. It is not clear why the curves in Fig. 11 do not all cross the origin.
R1.10. The curves from the FEM do pass through the origin. However, the
experimental curves do not pass through the origin due to a small pre-load of 1N that
was applied during testing. This pre-load was essential to take the slack out of the
system and specimen set-up. The test methodology section has been modified to
include this additional information.
C1.11. The description of the FE simulations misses details: What kind of elements
were used in the FE study? Was near-incompressibility assumed? If yes, how was this
implemented?
R1.11. Additional detail on the FE simulations were added on p. 5 including details on
the type of element used, assumptions for the incompressibility of the material.
C1.12. What is the force level associated with Fig. 12? What are the units in Figs. 9b,
10 (probably per cent) and how do they relate to the scale bars in Fig. 12. There is a
factor of 1000 between the scale bars.
R1.12. Figure 12 was taken at 50N force. The Figure caption has been modified to
include this information. We are grateful to the Referee for noticing the inconsistency
within the units of strain presented throughout the report. This has been edited to
ensure each Figure presenting strain data uses the units of mstrain or millistrain.
C1.13. More details on the following points in the materials and methods section
would be helpful:
What was the material of the molds used to cast the structures? How were Young’s
modulus and Poisson's ratio determined (p. 3 l. 16)? What method is used (by the
software) to compute strains from displacements (p. 3 l. 59)? It should be indicated
that “Snazaroo” is a manufacturer/brand name.
The specifications of the “three different camera set-ups” should be given (p. 4 l. 13).
Were they differing in terms of lenses? Is the “Imetrum video strain gauge” (p. 4 l. 37)
part of the Instra4D software mentioned before?
R1.13. Additional experimental details relating the points in comment 1.13 were
added to the paper. The details to address each of the points can be found bullet
pointed below in the same order:
<U+F0B7> The molds were manufactured from Aluminium.
<U+F0B7> The Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio were determined using an inverse
analysis method of uniaxial tensile testing and compression testing data.
<U+F0B7> A generic description of the method has been provided, and details of how
the software computes strains using affine transformation and the gradients
of the deformation.
<U+F0B7> Snazaroo was places in brackets to indicate it is a brand.
<U+F0B7> The camera set-up varied only in the field of view for each structure. The
exact same equipment, including calibration targets and lenses, were used
for each set up.
<U+F0B7> The Imetrum video strain gauge system is a separate system to the Instra4D
software. The set-up for this system was originally detailed in Experimental
Methods (c). However the section has been re-worded to provide a general
introduction to the DIC technique, before detailing the two methods.
Responses (R2.x) to Comments (C2.x) from Referee 2
C2.1. Each structure tested has a size of 100x100 mmm, with additional beams that
connect the structure to the boundary. For the 3x3 cell structure, the length of these
struts is approximately 25mm, so that two additional spring with a volume of
3*25*25/3=25*25 is used (where 25/3 is the thickness of the beams). For the 5x5 cell
structure these additional springs have a volume of 5*15*15/3=25*15, and for the
9x9 structure these two additional springs have a volume of 9*8.33*8.33/3=25*8.33.
Thus, the more unit cells used in the cellular structure, the stiffer the total additional
springs that has been used to connect the structure to the boundary. For example,
the stiffness of the additional spring connecting the cellular solid to the boundary
equals k=AE/L=Lz*t*E/L, which for the 3x3, 5x5, 9x9 structure are all equal to k=LzE/3.
However, as there are 3 beams for the 3x3 structure, 5 beams for the 5x5 structure
and 9 beams for the 9x9 structure, the stiffness increases linearly with the number of
cells. Therefore, I expect that the change in the stress-strain data comes from the
effect of boundary conditions.
R2.1. We note that, here, the Referee makes theoretical references to equations from
linear elasticity, which is based on Hooke’s law. These would be valid if the cell walls
were made from a linear elastic material (e.g. ceramics or metal). However, for the
structures of nonlinear elastic material that we consider, those equations would be
applicable only in the small strain regime, while under finite large strains, the
nonlinear field theory applies. Furthermore, Figure 7(b) shows little or no difference
between the three structures within the small strain regime and it is under large
strains that these structures exhibit the different strain behaviours. This is explained
in more detail in R1.3.
C2.2. The authors claim the Finite Element Analysis shows also the non-linear scaling,
but the authors have modeled exactly the same setup as in the experiments, so that
also here the boundary conditions are important and probably are the cause of the
nonlinear scaling. While the authors have applied symmetry conditions in the
horizontal direction, to fully check the scaling of the cell size the authors should have
used periodic boundary conditions on all sides, so that only a Representative Volume
Element has to be modeled (effectively simulating an infinitely large lattice). Given
that simulations for these structures are often normalised by length and stiffness,
even in the non-linear case, I do not expect any nonlinear scaling to occur, so that the
stiffness does not change with cell size, as long as the same amount of material is
used and the relative sizes are kept the same.
R2.2. Previous publications by our research group (reference 17,19) confirm the
nonlinear scaling effect both computationally and theoretically. Within these studies
the additional beams used within this study for experimentation were not included
and these previous studies used boundary conditions that were closer to periodic
boundary conditions. The computational modelling method in the previous studies
used the same software and, in some cases, used the same material properties. The
validation of the modelling work conducted within this current study provides greater
confidence in the results of these previous studies.
Furthermore, whilst this study does not use periodic boundary conditions, the
structures were tested under purely uniaxial tensile loading conditions, meaning that
the ends of the structures are free to move horizontally and any edge effects are
minimised, presenting similar conditions to periodic boundary conditions. Using the
boundary conditions presented within this current study allowed these structures to
be tested experimentally in an achievable way.
C2.3. The authors also claim that for small deformations, the results does not depend
on cell size, but looking closely at e.g. figure 5 shows that the stiffness is already
different from the initial loading. Can the authors plot the effective stiffness to check
this?
R2.3. This is a fair comment. Please see our response R1.3. Additionally the authors
investigated structure stiffness, using force displacement data from the tensile test
of the whole structures. Due to the methods involved there was a lot of noise present
within the data at low strains making it impossible to evaluate structure stiffness in
the small strain regime using the methods within this study.
C2.4. In the introduction, the authors mention that "this behaviour is also predicted
by finite element simulations [14,15,22]", and make this sentence sound like the
behaviour has been observed before in Finite Element Simulations, while the
reference only refer to general Finite Element Analysis implementations.
R2.4. This has now been corrected. Please see also our response below.
C2.5. If it turns out that the stiffness does scale nonlinearly with the cell size, I would
be very interested in the reason for this? Can the authors provide argumentation or
a physical effect for this. Also, for is there a limit on how stiff the structures can
become, and for which cell size would this be reached?
R2.5. We thank the Referee for all of the comments. First of all, we note that, for
different cellular structures with linear elastic cell walls, containing the same volume
of solid material, which is distributed either as a small number of large cells or as a
larger number of smaller cells, when the ratio between the thickness and the length
of a wall is the same, the stiffness of the corresponding structure would be the same
[10]. This behaviour appears reasonable for similar structures with nonlinear elastic
cell walls under small strains as well. However, in real structures, under sufficiently
large strains, the cell size is expected to have a more independent effect, even though
this effect may be relatively minor or harder to separate from other mechanical
responses [1,26]. Please refer to R1.1.-R1.2 for a detailed explanation of what causes
this nonlinear scaling effect.
We have now emphasised that the aim of the present paper is to separate the cell
size effect from other nonlinear effects when the size of the cells and the size of the
structure are comparable. This inevitably opens the door to further important
questions, one of which concerns the limiting behaviour that the Referee mentions
and which can only be concluded upon after further extensive testing and suitable
theoretical investigation. We are grateful to the Referee for this comment and we
shall bear it in mind for our future work.

Nonlinear scaling effects in the stiffness of soft cellular
structures
Responses to Referee’s report
Hayley Wyatt (on behalf of all authors)
We thank the Editor and the Referees for their constructive and careful feed-back on
our research paper entitled "Nonlinear scaling effects in the stiffness of soft cellular
structures" re-submitted for publication to Royal Society Open Science (RSOS). We
have further revised the manuscript taking into consideration all the new
recommendations and included below our detailed responses to the Referees’
comments. Our responses and the corresponding changes in the revised paper
appear in blue colour. For completeness, our responses to the previous comments
from the Referees’ of our original submission have been included at the end of this
document as well.
Responses (R3.x) to Comments (C3.x) from Referee 3
C3.1. The authors state up front that they are investigation a neo-Hookean material.
Is it therefore any surprise that there are nonlinear scaling effects? The same goes for
the finite element simulations. Is the point that if the same material had been used
in a non-cellular configuration (i.e just in bulk), one would also have seen nonlinear
behaviour, but at much greater displacements (forces)?
R3.1. Our study concerns the nonlinear elastic behaviour of cellular structures, which
is due to the distribution of the given material within each structure, as well as the
nonlinear elasticity of the cell walls. In particular, we show that, under sufficiently
large strains, the stiffness of the structures with nonlinear elastic cell wall varies with
the cell size [17,19], in contrast to the results predicted for structures with linear
elastic cell walls [10], given that the same volume of material is used for each
structure, and that the thickness to length ratio for the cell walls remains the same.
For example, the structure with 9x9 cells is stiffer in behaviour than that with 5x5 cells
despite being constructed from the same volume of material and having their cell
walls with the same thickness to length ratio. – This has been further emphasised in
the introduction.
C3.2. The section on finite element simulation leaves a lot unsaid. It would be useful
if there were a schematic of the computational domain, so that we can see how it
links to Figs. 1,3(a),4(a). The authors mention symmetry boundary conditions, but
what is actually being simulated – one quarter of Fig. 1?
R3.2. An additional figure, Figure 9, has been added to the paper. As per the referee’s
request, this Figure shows a schematic of the boundary conditions applied to the
structure and also a 3D view of the model with the rigid rods in place. Additional
information has been added to the main body of text to provide further clarity on the
finite element simulation.
C3.3. In Fig. 9 why are there two experimental curves for each structure but only one
theoretical curve? For the theoretical curve, I presume the model computes the
normal stress, among other things, and that this has been integrated over the surface
of the cylindrical rods to give the force.
R3.3. In old Figure 9 (new Figure 12) there are two experimental curves due to
repetition of the tests and variation within the experimental results. The theoretical
curve was calculated based on the computed outputs of the reaction force from
within the FEBio software. These were computed for each of the rigid rods used to
constrain the structures. To calculate the total reaction force the reaction force for all
rigid rods within the structure were totalled together, and then doubled due to the
symmetry assumption. This description has been added to the main body of text.
C3.4. It sounds like 3D computations were carried out, but this is never stated
explicitly. Mesh independence is touched on but never quantified. Some results
showing that the simulations really are mesh independent is needed. This should
indicate the number of elements used, and which quantity was used to judge that the
results really are mesh independent.
R3.4. An additional figure, Figure 10, has been added to the paper to display the
results for the mesh dependency of each of the structures. Additional detail has been
added to the main body of text about the total reaction force as the quantity used for
the assessment of the mesh dependency of the results. Furthermore, a table has
been added, Table 3, detailing the final details of the mesh used for each structure.
This table includes the total number of elements, total number of nodes and the
element type.
C3.5. It is unclear which material model was used for the simulation and what the
parameters were. The Young’s modulus and the Poisson ratio have been given, but
since the model used was not just the simplest elastic one, there must be other model
parameters also. It would be useful to see the equations of the model used. No doubt
these are given in refs. [17,19], but a short description would be useful here too.
R3.5. The constitutive law for the neo-Hookean hyperelastic material model was
added to the main body of text, and the corresponding model parameters were
clearly defined as well. Note that this is the simplest nonlinear hyperelastic model,
originally proposed to characterise the nonlinear elastic behaviour of rubberlike
material in [25,30].
C3.6. Fig. 11 seems to be the time evolution of strain, but were all the earlier figures
for some steady state, or were they also for some value of time? Indeed, this brings
into question the nature of the simulations in item 4 above – were they run until a
steady state was reached?
R3.6. Figure 11 (Figure 14 in the revised paper) showed strain against time, this was
because the structure was been stretched over a period of 1 second, so as the stretch
of the structure increased the strain within the structure walls also increased. The
figure has been modified to display the overall structure displacement against the
strain for the joint and for the cell walls to try and clarify the manuscript.

Responses (R4.x) to Comments (C4.x) from Referee 4
C4.1. Finite element analysis lacks details on mesh information (total number of
nodes and elements) and meshing of the sample overall (number of elements
throughout the thickness versus along other dimensions.
R4.1. Additional details of the mesh have been added to the paper, this has included
an additional figure, Figure 10, showing the results of the mesh sensitivity study and
Table 3, showing the final number of elements and nodes for each mesh. The mesh
used for each structure was made up of tetrahedral elements, and therefore it was
not possible to quantify the number of elements throughout the thickness versus
along other dimensions, therefore an additional figure, Figure 11, was included to
show an example of the mesh for the 5x5 structure.
C4.2. Details about the DIC settings should be provided in processing images to
compute displacements and strains. Also, the resolution of the strain field from the
DIC measurements should be given.
R4.2. Table 2 includes many details surrounding the data collections and processing
for the DIC. Additionally, the spatial resolution and the strain noise have been added
to this table.
C4.3. Authors state that the differences in Figure 5 may be attributed to changes in
mixture ratio to create the silicone. For an experiment such as this, one may expect
the same material being used/ mixed for all samples. Another listed reason is
temperature, but silicone is not very sensitive to temperature changes, unless it is
significant and would not be expected to happen here.
R4.3. The same material was used to create all the structures evaluated. However,
they were made from different batches of the same silicone due to only one mould
for each structure being made. Whilst the same material was used, small variations
in the material properties would be possible due to small variations in the mixture.
This difference in mixture is one possible explanation for the slight variation in
structure properties seen in Figure 5. The temperature statement has been modified
in the main body of text to read as follows: “Another possible explanation between
the variations in experimental results is changes in the testing environment between
samples, for example, tests were not conducted in a temperature-controlled
environment.” This is to highlight a possible reason for variation as the testing
environment.
C4.4. There are several problems with the statement “…that the stiffness in cell walls
made from an isotropic nonlinear hyperplastic material increases when the number
of cells…” made by the authors. One is that the stiffness in the cell walls does not
change, but the overall stiffness of the entire structure. Second is that the term
“stiffness” is a vague term for nonlinear behaviour and should be precisely defined in
this context. This is that the stiffness only changes at large deformations and not small
deformations and has not been explicitly written in the conclusions in that same
sentence.
R4.4. The statement has been edited to explicitly include the phase under large
deformations.
C4.5. Looking at Figure 5, there are big variations between the samples used for the
9x9 structure (solid versus dashed curve) and for the 3x3 samples. The different for
the 5x5 curve is minimal though. If the difference in curves for the 5x5 structure were
significant, the entire analysis in this manuscript would be inconclusive.
R4.5. The authors take the Referee’s feedback on board regarding the scatter of the
data and will seek to improve upon the experimental work in future research.
C4.6. The authors stated that from past studies the stiffness at small deformations
did not change with the cell size. Looking at Figure 5 and Figure 9, it appears to have
some changes for small deformations as well.
R4.6. Both Figures 5 and Figure 12 (Figure 9 in the old manuscript) show force against
displacement for each of the structures. However, it is important to note that all
structures are different in overall height due to the length of the tabs for loading.
When looking at Figure 7(b), showing the Force versus axial strain for the three
structure, there is no or little difference in the behaviour of the structures in the small
strain regime, with the difference in stiffness of the structures becoming increasingly
pronounced at larger deformations.
The following responses relate to the comments from the Referees’ of our original
submission of the manuscript. These comments were addressed prior to the re-
submission of the manuscript and have been included here for completeness.
Responses (R1.x) to Comments (C1.x) from Referee 1
C1.1. The authors call the observed behavior “nonlinear scaling effects in the
stiffness”. Could they be more precise in specifying which quantities exactly are
related by the non-linear scaling law(s)?
C1.2. The paper misses an explanation of the observed effect although the
experimental and computational analyses would probably allow this. At least a
hypothesis on the cause of the structural effect should be formulated, and analyses
for validation/rejection should be performed. For example, it could be interesting to
compare with the response of a continuous structure of identical cross section area.
R1.1.-R1.2. We thank the Referee for these comments. First of all, we note that, for
different cellular structures with linear elastic cell walls, containing the same volume
of solid material, which is distributed either as a small number of large cells or as a
larger number of smaller cells, when the ratio between the thickness and the length
of a wall is the same, the stiffness of the corresponding structure would be the same
[10]. This behaviour appears reasonable for similar structures with nonlinear elastic
cell walls under small strains as well. However, in real structures, under sufficiently
large strains, the cell size is expected to have a more independent effect, even though
this effect may be relatively minor or harder to separate from other mechanical
responses [1,26].
The scope of our paper is to separate the cell size effect from other nonlinear
mechanical responses when the size of the cells and the size of the structure are
comparable (i.e. the cells are not infinitesimally small relative to the cellular sample).
Specifically, for cellular structures with uniform cell size, shape, and distribution, we
demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the stiffness in cell walls made
from an isotropic nonlinear hyperelastic material increases when the number of cells
increases while the volume of solid material and the ratio between the thickness and
the length of the wall remain fixed. Additional analysis was conducted on the FEA
models to understand this behaviour. Within the paper an additional section (5c) and
an additional figure, Figure 11, have been added. This analysis shows that the cell
joints exhibit a different nonlinear behaviour when compared to the cell walls, this is
thought to be due to additional constraints. Therefore when there are more joints
present within a structure you change the overall response of the structure. The
difference in response between the joints and walls is not seen within the small strain
regime, but is instead seen at larger deformations. In addition to the finite element
results presented in this paper, the computational and theoretical results published
by our group in [17,19] also confirm this nonlinear elastic effect.
We have now emphasised that the aim of the present paper is not to make the cell
size go to zero, as it would be the case for a continuous structure, but rather to
separate the cell size effect from other nonlinear effects when the size of the cells
and the size of the structure are comparable.
C1.3. At several points, the authors report that the effect would not be visible in the
“small strain regime” or for “infinitesimal strain theory” (e.g. p. 1 l. 47, p. 2 l. 47, p. 6
l. 47). However, both the experiments in Fig. 5 but particularly the simulations in Fig.
11 indicate differences in the initial slope of the force-displacement curves, i.e. for
small strains (even if hard to assess from the given representation of the data). The
claim should thus be reconsidered and be either revised or substantiated by a more
appropriate analysis of the data.
R1.3. The differences seen in Figures 5 and 11 are caused by the variation in the
overall size of the specimen due to the loading tabs and therefore the data is not
representative of strain between the different specimens. The data within Figure 6
and 7(b) show the difference in strain between the different specimens. Within both
of these figures, there is very little difference within the strains of the cell walls in the
small strain regime (typically this is classified as below 4% or 40 mstrain). Figure 7b,
shows the strain within the cell walls beginning to vary at approx. 15%. Please see
also our response R1.2.
C1.4. It seems that each experiment (3x3, 5x5 and 9x9) was only conducted once, i.e.
n=1. Although the use of a commercial silicone suggests little variations, a reasonable
number of repetitions and statistical assessment would reveal how large the
differences between the structures are compared to their own variability due to, e.g.,
fabrication.
R1.4. We thank the Referee for this suggestion. Additional specimens were
manufactured for testing, one for each structure type taking the number of
specimens tested to 2, n=2. The authors accept this is a limitation of the current study,
and the additional tests did show some variation within the data, however, all
structures tested found the same trend, with the 9x9 structure always been stiffer
than the 5x5 which in turn was always stiffer than the 3x3 structure demonstrating
the effect or trend the paper is based upon. The text has been modified to reflect this
additional testing, and reasons for the variation within the data are now discussed.
We would also like to point out that:
<U+F0B7> In addition to the finite element results shown in this paper, preliminary
computational results published by our group in [17,19] also indicate a similar
behaviour.
<U+F0B7> Moreover, a statistical analysis is possible only if sufficient experimental data
are available, with more samples being required. Our group is currently
developing stochastic approaches which we hope to incorporate in our future
work in due course (see Mihai LA, Woolley TE, Goriely A. 2018. Stochastic
isotropic hyperelastic materials: constitutive calibration and model selection,
Proceedings of the Royal Society A 474, 20170858). However, this is beyond
the immediate scope of our current paper.
C1.5. Fig. 9 seems not in agreement with the text on p. 5 ls. 22-24: The figure reports
“microstrain”, the text refers to “mean vertical strain” or “certain maximum vertical
displacement”.
C1.6. The order of stiffness and strain magnitude is reported in a confusing way,
beginning with the 5x5 structure rather than ordering by increasing/decreasing
values. This could be improved.
R1.5.-R1.6. The text on p. 5 was modified to reflect the terminology used within Figure
9, namely Lagrange axial strain. Additionally, the text was modified to report the
strain magnitude in decreasing values to make the presentation of the results clearer.
C1.7. p. 5 ls. 26-35: There are three principal strains, do the authors refer to maximum
principal strain?
R1.7. The authors were referring to the maximum principal strain on p.5 ls 26-25. The
text has been modified to clarify this.
C1.8. Figs. 6-8 would better be presented together in one figure to see the evolution
of the strain field. The scale bars are not readable.
R1.8. The Figures were combined to be included in one Figure as suggested.
Additionally, the scale bars were enlarged, with fewer increments included, and text
was made larger to improve the clarity. Figure numbers were modified to reflect
these changes.
C1.9. The authors report “excellent agreement” between experiment and FE
simulations on p. 6, l.9 for the 9x9 and 5x5 structures. The agreement seems fair but
there are noticeable deviations in the moderate strain regime (Fig. 11) that need a
critical discussion, in particular considering the high degree of definition of this
system in terms of material properties and boundary conditions.
R1.9. The statement was changed to read ‘general agreement’, following the
recommendation. An additional paragraph was added to this section of the paper to
discuss possible reasons for the differences between the experimental data and finite
element simulations.
C1.10. It is not clear why the curves in Fig. 11 do not all cross the origin.
R1.10. The curves from the FEM do pass through the origin. However, the
experimental curves do not pass through the origin due to a small pre-load of 1N that
was applied during testing. This pre-load was essential to take the slack out of the
system and specimen set-up. The test methodology section has been modified to
include this additional information.
C1.11. The description of the FE simulations misses details: What kind of elements
were used in the FE study? Was near-incompressibility assumed? If yes, how was this
implemented?
R1.11. Additional detail on the FE simulations were added on p. 5 including details on
the type of element used, assumptions for the incompressibility of the material.
C1.12. What is the force level associated with Fig. 12? What are the units in Figs. 9b,
10 (probably per cent) and how do they relate to the scale bars in Fig. 12. There is a
factor of 1000 between the scale bars.
R1.12. Figure 12 was taken at 50N force. The Figure caption has been modified to
include this information. We are grateful to the Referee for noticing the inconsistency
within the units of strain presented throughout the report. This has been edited to
ensure each Figure presenting strain data uses the units of mstrain or millistrain.
C1.13. More details on the following points in the materials and methods section
would be helpful:
What was the material of the molds used to cast the structures? How were Young’s
modulus and Poisson's ratio determined (p. 3 l. 16)? What method is used (by the
software) to compute strains from displacements (p. 3 l. 59)? It should be indicated
that “Snazaroo” is a manufacturer/brand name.
The specifications of the “three different camera set-ups” should be given (p. 4 l. 13).
Were they differing in terms of lenses? Is the “Imetrum video strain gauge” (p. 4 l. 37)
part of the Instra4D software mentioned before?
R1.13. Additional experimental details relating the points in comment 1.13 were
added to the paper. The details to address each of the points can be found bullet
pointed below in the same order:
<U+F0B7> The molds were manufactured from Aluminium.
<U+F0B7> The Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio were determined using an inverse
analysis method of uniaxial tensile testing and compression testing data.
<U+F0B7> A generic description of the method has been provided, and details of how
the software computes strains using affine transformation and the gradients
of the deformation.
<U+F0B7> Snazaroo was places in brackets to indicate it is a brand.
<U+F0B7> The camera set-up varied only in the field of view for each structure. The
exact same equipment, including calibration targets and lenses, were used
for each set up.
<U+F0B7> The Imetrum video strain gauge system is a separate system to the Instra4D
software. The set-up for this system was originally detailed in Experimental
Methods (c). However the section has been re-worded to provide a general
introduction to the DIC technique, before detailing the two methods.
Responses (R2.x) to Comments (C2.x) from Referee 2
C2.1. Each structure tested has a size of 100x100 mmm, with additional beams that
connect the structure to the boundary. For the 3x3 cell structure, the length of these
struts is approximately 25mm, so that two additional spring with a volume of
3*25*25/3=25*25 is used (where 25/3 is the thickness of the beams). For the 5x5 cell
structure these additional springs have a volume of 5*15*15/3=25*15, and for the
9x9 structure these two additional springs have a volume of 9*8.33*8.33/3=25*8.33.
Thus, the more unit cells used in the cellular structure, the stiffer the total additional
springs that has been used to connect the structure to the boundary. For example,
the stiffness of the additional spring connecting the cellular solid to the boundary
equals k=AE/L=Lz*t*E/L, which for the 3x3, 5x5, 9x9 structure are all equal to k=LzE/3.
However, as there are 3 beams for the 3x3 structure, 5 beams for the 5x5 structure
and 9 beams for the 9x9 structure, the stiffness increases linearly with the number of
cells. Therefore, I expect that the change in the stress-strain data comes from the
effect of boundary conditions.
R2.1. We note that, here, the Referee makes theoretical references to equations from
linear elasticity, which is based on Hooke’s law. These would be valid if the cell walls
were made from a linear elastic material (e.g. ceramics or metal). However, for the
structures of nonlinear elastic material that we consider, those equations would be
applicable only in the small strain regime, while under finite large strains, the
nonlinear field theory applies. Furthermore, Figure 7(b) shows little or no difference
between the three structures within the small strain regime and it is under large
strains that these structures exhibit the different strain behaviours. This is explained
in more detail in R1.3.
C2.2. The authors claim the Finite Element Analysis shows also the non-linear scaling,
but the authors have modeled exactly the same setup as in the experiments, so that
also here the boundary conditions are important and probably are the cause of the
nonlinear scaling. While the authors have applied symmetry conditions in the
horizontal direction, to fully check the scaling of the cell size the authors should have
used periodic boundary conditions on all sides, so that only a Representative Volume
Element has to be modeled (effectively simulating an infinitely large lattice). Given
that simulations for these structures are often normalised by length and stiffness,
even in the non-linear case, I do not expect any nonlinear scaling to occur, so that the
stiffness does not change with cell size, as long as the same amount of material is
used and the relative sizes are kept the same.
R2.2. Previous publications by our research group (reference 17,19) confirm the
nonlinear scaling effect both computationally and theoretically. Within these studies
the additional beams used within this study for experimentation were not included
and these previous studies used boundary conditions that were closer to periodic
boundary conditions. The computational modelling method in the previous studies
used the same software and, in some cases, used the same material properties. The
validation of the modelling work conducted within this current study provides greater
confidence in the results of these previous studies.
Furthermore, whilst this study does not use periodic boundary conditions, the
structures were tested under purely uniaxial tensile loading conditions, meaning that
the ends of the structures are free to move horizontally and any edge effects are
minimised, presenting similar conditions to periodic boundary conditions. Using the
boundary conditions presented within this current study allowed these structures to
be tested experimentally in an achievable way.
C2.3. The authors also claim that for small deformations, the results does not depend
on cell size, but looking closely at e.g. figure 5 shows that the stiffness is already
different from the initial loading. Can the authors plot the effective stiffness to check
this?
R2.3. This is a fair comment. Please see our response R1.3. Additionally the authors
investigated structure stiffness, using force displacement data from the tensile test
of the whole structures. Due to the methods involved there was a lot of noise present
within the data at low strains making it impossible to evaluate structure stiffness in
the small strain regime using the methods within this study.
C2.4. In the introduction, the authors mention that "this behaviour is also predicted
by finite element simulations [14,15,22]", and make this sentence sound like the
behaviour has been observed before in Finite Element Simulations, while the
reference only refer to general Finite Element Analysis implementations.
R2.4. This has now been corrected. Please see also our response below.
C2.5. If it turns out that the stiffness does scale nonlinearly with the cell size, I would
be very interested in the reason for this? Can the authors provide argumentation or
a physical effect for this. Also, for is there a limit on how stiff the structures can
become, and for which cell size would this be reached?
R2.5. We thank the Referee for all of the comments. First of all, we note that, for
different cellular structures with linear elastic cell walls, containing the same volume
of solid material, which is distributed either as a small number of large cells or as a
larger number of smaller cells, when the ratio between the thickness and the length
of a wall is the same, the stiffness of the corresponding structure would be the same
[10]. This behaviour appears reasonable for similar structures with nonlinear elastic
cell walls under small strains as well. However, in real structures, under sufficiently
large strains, the cell size is expected to have a more independent effect, even though
this effect may be relatively minor or harder to separate from other mechanical
responses [1,26]. Please refer to R1.1.-R1.2 for a detailed explanation of what causes
this nonlinear scaling effect.
We have now emphasised that the aim of the present paper is to separate the cell
size effect from other nonlinear effects when the size of the cells and the size of the
structure are comparable. This inevitably opens the door to further important
questions, one of which concerns the limiting behaviour that the Referee mentions
and which can only be concluded upon after further extensive testing and suitable
theoretical investigation. We are grateful to the Referee for this comment and we
shall bear it in mind for our future work.
