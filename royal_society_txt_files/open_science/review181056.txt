An interesting discovery. Figures of Acanthostega and Densignathus were switched in Fig. 2, also
a couple of other minor inaccuracies. At least one results from choosing the scan over the
drawing of the specimen for your data. A few upper and lower case letters need to be amended.
Should not there be a ZooBank ID erected for your new genus?

This is a very interesting and valuable paper that carefully examines material from an iconic fossil
assemblage - the Joggins tetrapod fauna - to unmask its true diversity, identifying the presence of
an aistopod in the Joggins. This brings the Joggins into line with other faunal communities of the
times. Additionally, the specimen exhibits numerous primitive features that place it at the base of
Aistopoda and supports earlier work by the authors that aistopods are basal within Tetrapoda. A
very nice piece of work.
There are a few minor typos throughout the manuscript; please see annotated PDF (Appendix A).
Additionally, I would suggest a few other minor changes prior to publication:
1. The is virtually no description of the splenial and no mention of the postsplenial in the
description, even though they are both figured. A brief description of both elements would be
useful.
3
2. Is there any information available on the nature of the contacts (overlapping, interdigitated)
between the bones?
3. The Meckelian ossification is discussed in the text but not labelled in Figure 1 - could this be
added?
4. I think that e and f are reversed (in terms of the taxa that they are identified as) in Figure 2 -
please check.
Congratulations on a nice paper!

29
13 Earliest Pennsylvanian (Bashkirian) vertebrate fossil assemblages of the Joggins Formation
30
31 14 (Cumberland Group) of Nova Scotia, Canada, have long been noted for the unique representation of the
32
33 15 earliest known crown amniotes, but the overall vertebrate fauna remains poorly-understood. The vast
34
35 16 majority of Joggins vertebrates have historically been assigned to the Microsauria, a group originally
36
37 17 established by Dawson specifically to accommodate the abundant, diminutive fossils of the Joggins
38
39 18 Formation. As the Microsauria concept has evolved, some Joggins taxa (e.g. the eureptile Hylonomus
40
41 19 lyelli) have been removed from the group, but many of the Joggins ‘microsaurs’ remain unrevised,
42
43 20 obscuring the true diversity of the earliest Pennsylvanian tetrapod fauna. Here we amend part of this
44
45
21 problem by revisiting the morphology of Dawson’s ‘microsaur’ Hylerpeton longidentatum. This taxon,
46
47
48
22 represented by the anterior half of a left hemimandible, is here reinterpreted as a plesiomorphic aïstopod
49
50 23 and assigned to a new genus, Andersonerpeton. A. longidentatum shows a surprisingly primitive anatomy
51
52 24 of the lower jaw, retaining a parasymphyseal fang pair on the dentary, an adsymphyseal bone bearing a
53
54 25 denticle field, fangs on all coronoids, and parasymphyseal foramina, as well as a prearticular which
55
56 26 extends far anterior along the coronoid series. However, several aïstopod characters can also be seen,
57

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 2 of 16

2
3 27 including a lack of sculpturing on the dentary and a reduced number of recurved, weakly-socketed teeth.
4
5 28 The anatomy of A. longidentatum corroborates recent phylogenetic work which has placed the origin of
6
7
29 aïstopods within the Devonian fin-to-limb transition but preserves a mosaic of characteristics suggesting
8
9
10 30 an even earlier divergence. The presence of an aïstopod in the Joggins fauna expands the taxonomic
11
12 31 diversity of the Joggins fauna and suggests that Joggins may preserve a more typical Carboniferous fauna
13
14 32 than previously thought.

26
38
27
28
29
39 The transition between the lower Carboniferous (Mississippian) and upper Carboniferous
30
31 40 (Pennsylvanian) marks the transition from faunas dominated by archaic tetrapod groups spanning the
32
33 41 assembly of the tetrapod body plan to faunas dominated by representatives of the tetrapod crown group
34
35 42 which preserve the origin and diversification of major tetrapod lineages (sauropsids, synapsids, and
36
37 43 lissamphibians). This interval is represented by only a handful of tetrapod-bearing localities. Of these, the
38
39 44 best-understood is the classical tetrapod fauna of Joggins, Nova Scotia [1-4]. The Joggins fauna preserves
40
41 45 a variety of early tetrapods, including an assortment of stem tetrapods and stem-amphibians as well as the
42
43 46 earliest members of the reptile (Hylonomus lyelli) and mammal (Protoclepsydrops haplous) lineages [4].
44
45
47 Despite the importance of the Joggins fauna, much of its diversity remains uncertain. Dawson
46
47
48
48 assigned much of the diversity to the Microsauria [1-3], a higher taxon he established to accommodate
49
50 49 several species each of Hylonomus and Hylerpeton [2]. Steen [5] updated much of this taxonomy,
51
52 50 assigning many of Dawson’s ‘microsaurs’ to the better-accepted Lepospondyli [6] and establishing
53
54 51 several new genera, but recognizing that many of Dawson’s “microsaurs” were not definitively assignable
55
56 52 to any particular taxon. Carroll [7,8] further revised the taxonomy, acknowledging that many of the
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 3 of 16 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 53 historic ‘microsaurs’ were likely not assignable to that group. Despite this history of work, many of the
4
5 54 taxa established by Dawson (Hylonomus, Hylerpeton, Dendrerpeton) remain incompletely revised, likely
6
7
55 obscuring the full diversity present at Joggins. Subsequent revisions of Joggins amniotes have suggested
8
9
10 56 that at least some taxa attributed to early eureptiles (e.g. Archerpeton) may instead belong to ‘microsaurs’
11
12 57 [9] and vice versa [4] although recent phylogenetic studies have shown that the distinction between these
13
14 58 two groups may be artificial [10]. However, many of the remaining taxa have not been revisited for some
15
16 59 time, with taxonomic identifications reliant on obsolete phylogenetic frameworks. As a result, the
17
18 60 ecological (upland vs. lowland) and paleobiogeographical context in which the earliest amniotes evolved
19
20 61 remains largely uncertain.
21
22 62 While revising the Joggins ‘microsaurs’, we examined the holotype of Hylerpeton longidentatum
23
24 63 Dawson 1876. This jaw was first reported by Dawson [2] as a jaw attributable to the ‘microsaur’
25
26
64 Hylerpeton, but distinguishable from the type species Hylerpeton dawsoni by the long, recurved dentition.
27
28
29
65 Steen [5] and Carroll [8] both expressed doubts to the microsaurian nature of the specimen, but both
30
31 66 withholding judgment to its taxonomic identity, although Carroll [8] noted some similarities with non-
32
33 67 tetrapod sarcopterygians. This specimen, which consists of the anterior half of a left lower jaw, is
34
35 68 definitively not attributable to Hylonomus, ‘microsaurs’, or any temnospondyl, and instead represents the
36
37 69 first aïstopod from Joggins, and from Canada more generally. Aïstopods are highly-specialized limbless
38
39 70 snake-like early tetrapods found abundantly in Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian fossil localities
40
41 71 across North America and Europe [11-13] and are one of the most abundant tetrapodamorph fossils found
42
43 72 in some Carboniferous-aged sites including Mazon Creek, Illinois, Linton, Ohio and Five Points, Ohio.
44
45
73 Aïstopods are present but rare in the Lower Carboniferous of Scotland [14,15], but recent assessment of
46
47
48
74 their morphology and phylogenetics suggests this lineage had a Devonian origin among ichthyostegalian-
49
50 75 grade stem-tetrapods [10]. We here describe the Joggins aïstopod, finding surprisingly primitive
51
52 76 morphology not previously reported in an aïstopod. This new fossil bridges the morphological gap
53
54 77 between the fish-like stem-tetrapod outgroups and the snake-like Permo-Carboniferous aïstopods.

117 Comments: Aside from this lower jaw, a number of other fossil tetrapod elements are present in the
30
31 118 Joggins tree stump and are accessioned under the specimen number RM 2.1129. These remains include a
32
33 119 number of fragmentary postcranial remains including ribs, an interclavicle, vertebrae, and several isoated
34
35 120 cranial bones. None of these appear attributable to an aïstopod or aïstopod-like tetrapod, however, and
36
37 121 likely represent a small eureptile, such as Hylonomus, or a recumbirostran.

45
125 The dentary is relatively narrow and thin in lateral aspect and tapers slightly anteriorly (Figure 1).
46
47
48
126 The external surface of the dentary is generally unornamented but shows a dense field of foramina ventral
49
50 127 to the tooth row. A small row of pustular ornament is present lateral to the tooth row along the anterior
51
52 128 quarter of the jaw (Figure 1B). The symphysial region is dorsally recurved such that the occlusal surface
53
54 129 of the symphyseal region faces somewhat posterodorsally rather than directly dorsally. The symphysis is
55
56 130 composed primarily of the dentary, without an obvious contribution of the splenial on the lateral surface.

5 132 parasymphyseal fang is present lateral to the symphysis (Figure 1C); the fang is approximately the same
6
7
133 size as the marginal teeth. Marginal teeth are long and recurved without substantial heterodonty. Marginal
8
9
10 134 teeth are all loosely connected to the underlying dentary, and many fold posteromedially exaggerating the
11
12 135 recurved appearance of the dentition. A similar weak articulation between the teeth and jaw can be seen in
13
14 136 the aïstopod Coloraderpeton brilli [10,13] and possibly in an unnamed phlegethontiid from Montceau-
15
16 137 les-Mines [16], and is observable in other oestocephalids [11], but has not to our knowledge been reported
17
18 138 elsewhere in early tetrapods.
19
20 139 Just posterior to the parasymphyseal fang, an adsymphyseal sits in articulation with the dentary
21
22 140 (Figure 1C). The adsymphyseal is covered by a shagreen of denticles and extends posteriorly medial to
23
24 141 the lateral parasymphyseal foramina to contact the anterior coronoid. The anterior coronoid is large and
25
26
142 exhibits a prominent fang pair at its anteriormost extent. The coronoid fangs are approximately as large as
27
28
29
143 the marginal teeth, and are similarly folded posteriorly, suggesting a similar weak implantation zone. A
30
31 144 broad denticle field posterior to the first coronoid represents the middle and posterior coronoid. A fang-pit
32
33 145 pair is present on the anterior portion of the second coronoid, but no conspicuous fang-pit pair is present
34
35 146 on the third coronoid. All three coronoids are separated from the tooth row by a trough of the dentary,
36
37 147 which may have held the successional dental lamina and associated tissues. The anterior coronoid is
38
39 148 bounded medially by a lamina of the splenial, whereas the middle and posterior coronoid are bounded
40
41 149 medially by the prearticular.

2
3 156 Andersonerpeton longidentatum shows several conspicuous aïstopod-like characteristics,
4
5 157 particularly the weak, possibly ligamentous, articulation between the anterior dentary teeth and the
6
7
158 underlying dentary bone. This is seen also in ophiderpetontids [11] and the specialized basal aïstopod
8
9
10 159 Coloraderpeton brilli [10,13] and gives the appearance of a highly-recurved anterior dentition. A similar
11
12 160 weak contact between the marginal dentition and the underlying bone has also been reported in a
13
14 161 phlegethontiid from Montceau-les-Mines [16]. Although parallels have been drawn between this weak
15
16 162 implantation zone and lissamphibian pedicelly [16], no orthodentine pedicels are present, and instead
17
18 163 mature teeth implant into alveoli in a manner comparable to that seen in snakes [17,18]. Interestingly, the
19
20 164 marginal dentition of the elginerpetontids Elginerpeton pancheni and Obruchevichthys gracilis is
21
22 165 typically absent, with most tooth loci represented only by open alveoli comparable in some ways to the
23
24 166 aïstopod condition [19,20].
25
26
167 This is consistent with other features of A. longidentatum which suggest not only a basal position
27
28
29
168 within Aïstopoda, but also a basal position within tetrapods more broadly. Conspicuously, teeth of A.
30
31 169 longidentatum show labyrinthine infolding. Labyrinthine infolding is plesiomorphic for tetrapods but is
32
33 170 absent in ophiderpetontids and Coloraderpeton brilli and is presumed to be absent in Lethiscus stocki and
34
35 171 phlegethontiids. The presence of prominent parasymphyseal and coronoid fangs is unique and unexpected
36
37 172 among aistopods as well but is consistent with the morphology seen in some stem tetrapods (Figure 2),
38
39 173 particularly Elginerpeton pancheni, Densignathus rowei, Metaxygnathus denticulatus, Ventastega
40
41 174 curonica, and, to a lesser degree, Ichthyostega [21]. The presence of a robust Meckelian ossification
42
43 175 exposed medially, dividing the prearticular from the postdentary bones, specifically supports a close
44
45
176 relationship with early stem-tetrapods, suggesting that the aïstopod lineage diverged from crown tetrapods
46
47
48
177 as early as the late Frasnian. Comparison with Coloraderpeton brilli [10,13] suggests a similar condition
49
50 178 in that taxon, albeit with the Meckel’s bone fused to the overlapping prearticular and, possibly, the
51
52 179 articular. This compound bone may correspond to the “posterior element” of phlegethontiids as well.
53
54 180 One specifically interesting character that should receive further attention is the fine pustular
55
56 181 ornament just lateral to the dentary tooth row. Early tetrapodomorphs typically show a row of small
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 16
1
2
3 182 denticles lateral to the dentary tooth row [22], but these denticles are lost early in the fin-to-limb
4
5 183 transition, essentially appearing only in Elginerpeton pancheni [19]. The ornament in Andersonerpeton
6
7
184 longidentatum is similar in appearance, but it is unclear whether these pustules represent actual denticles,
8
9
10 185 or simply pustular ornament similar to that seen in an assortment of taxa spanning the fin-to-limb
11
12 186 transition. If these pustules are in fact dental in origin, this would suggest an even earlier origin of
13
14 187 aïstopods within the tetrapod stem, with aïstopods diverging from the tetrapod stem lineage prior to the
15
16 188 divergence of ichthyostegalids, metaxygnathids, and whatcheeriids. Given the absence of articulated
17
18 189 autopodia in elginerpetontids, and the absence of differentiated digits in all taxa stemward of
19
20 190 Elginerpeton [23], it may be worth considering whether the limbless aïstopods diverged from tetrapods
21
22 191 prior to the origin of digits.
23
24 192
25
26
193 Aïstopods in the Joggins Fauna
27
28
29
194
30
31 195 Aïstopods show a number of characteristics associated with an aquatic lifestyle such as well-
32
33 196 developed cranial lateral line canals and a spiracle [10] and are typically associated with aquatic-
34
35 197 dominated faunas such as Mazon Creek, Linton, N<U+1EF3>rany, and Montceau-les-Mines [12, 16], although they
36
37 198 do sometimes occur in terrestrial-dominated faunas such as the Interval 300 Quarry [13] and Dolese
38
39 199 Quarry [24,25] faunas, leading to uncertainty over how terrestrial aïstopods actually were [12,16]. The
40
41 200 presence of an aïstopod in the Old Forest layer at Joggins follows this pattern of uncertain depositional
42
43 201 environment. Andersonerpeton longidentatum comes from a bone-bearing deposit within an upright -
44
45
202 lycopsid stump along with other tetrapod remains. Although the stump deposits are thought to represent
46
47
48
203 entirely terrestrial faunas, including terrestrial eureptiles [26], synapsids [4], ‘microsaurs’ [7], and
49
50 204 temnospondyls [27], the stump-bearing horizons also contain aquatic embolomeres [28] as well as a range
51
52 205 of chondrichthyans, dipnoans, and actinopterygians [29], including fish and embolomere material within
53
54 206 the stumps themselves (pers. obs. AM & JDP, 2018). Although the upright stump assemblages have been
55
56 207 traditionally interpreted as evidence of refuge-seeking by terrestrial animals during forest fires [30], the
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 9 of 16 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 208 abundance of aquatic material suggests this is a mixed attritional assemblage with both aquatic and
4
5 209 terrestrial components, and that A. longidentatum could plausibly belong to either an aquatic or terrestrial
6
7
210 component of the overall Joggins fauna.
8
9
10 211 The presence of an aïstopod in the Joggins fauna brings Joggins more in line with faunal
11
12 212 communities of the Upper Mississippian (e.g. East Kirkton) as well as typical faunas of the
13
14 213 Carboniferous-Permian Transition. This is essentially expected given the presence of two aïstopods (the
15
16 214 plesiomorphic aïstopod Lethiscus stocki from Wardie Shale [14] and the ophiderpetontid Ophiderpeton
17
18 215 kirktonense from East Kirkton [15]) in the Viséan of Scotland, and the diverse aïstopods of the
19
20 216 Carboniferous-Permian Transition but fills a gap in the interval spanning the Serpukhovian and
21
22 217 Bashkirian in which aïstopods and other small tetrapods are poorly-represented. Although
23
24 218 Andersonerpeton longidentatum is only a single record, this record nonetheless shows that previous
25
26
219 workers have underestimated the taxonomic diversity of the Joggins fauna by placing most small-bodied
27
28
29
220 vertebrates into unrevised wastebasket taxa. We expect that careful taxonomic revision of the Joggins
30
31 221 material will continue to bring the Joggins fauna in line with both classic vertebrate assemblages from
32
33 222 both the late Mississippian as well as the Carboniferous-Permian Transition.

Appendix B
Dear Editor,
Please see our revised manuscript. We have taken care to address all reviewer
comments. In particular, we have revised Figure 1 to more clearly figure the
Meckelian bone (unclear in the original drawings) and have revised Figure 2 to
correct taxonomic confusion and to address some minor anatomical differences that
one of the reviewers noted. We have also included a zoobank ID to associate with
the nomenclatural act made in this manuscript.
