The paper presents an interesting method to improve dielectric properties of composites based on
polymers and ceramics which can be used in the electronic industry. The following changes must
be made in the article:
The wording of the abstract should be revised.
The word "Ahout" does not exist.
The word "compomsites" does not exist.
The word "expermental" does not exist.
Units and quantities must be separated.
Technical variables must be emphasized using italic fonts.
In FTIR analysis the presence of alumina must be emphasized.
In dielectric properties a more exhaustive list of papers where different models for determining
electrical permittivity or electrical conductivity must be included by example “Analysis of DC
Electrical Conductivity

account
8
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Response to Reviewer 1
We sincerely thank the reviewer for reviewing our manuscript and constructive
suggestions. This reviewer raised a few questions about details. Following are our
replies.
Question: Some corrections
We have carefully revised the misused words and expressions accordingly.
1.We revised the words: "about", "composites", "experimental”.
2.We made all units and quantities separated.
3.We changed “I-Al2O3”and “S-Al2O3” to “i-Al2O3”and “s-Al2O3”,which "i" and "s" are
italic fonts.
4.We changed “a”, “ß1” and “ß2” from non-italic fonts to italic fonts.
5.We analysis the characteristic peaks of alumina in FTIR analysis. Please find the
results and the description in the revised manuscript (Page 3).
6.We added the refereences “33-37” and “42” to further justify the rationality of the
experimental results.
