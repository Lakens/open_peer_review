The UTP14 gene has undegone retrotransposition in mammals, which generated a functional
gene (called retrogene). The author of this manuscript as well as another group previously
revealed that this retrogene is essential for spermatogenesis. In this manuscript, the author
searched copies of UTP14 retrogenes in genomic sequences of mammals, yielding a list of this
retrogene family in a variety of mammalian species. The author found multiple independent
retrotransposition as well as loss (although less frequent) of the retrogene in mammalian lineages.
Although many genomes analyzed are not completely assembled, the author was able to identify
the human syntenic regions for the retrogene insertion, which allowed discussion of the
evolutionary fates of individual insertions. The manuscript is well written and provides a
fundamental dataset for future studies on the UTP14 retrogenes in their function as well as the
evolution of mammalian spermatogenesis. On considering its publication, I have only a minor
suggestion to improve the manuscript.
<Minor comment>
Although stated in Conclusions, it is unclear in the Introduction if the UTP14 retrogenes are
experimentally shown to be functional by experiments. Thus, the brief description about what
have been revealed in ref.11, 12 and 13 would help the readers to understand why these
retrogenes are focused and interesting.

In this work, Rohozinski performs a series of bioinformatic analyses of UTP14 retrogenes in an
extended mammalian phylogeny. The paper is very clearly written and the analyses are
straightforward to follow. The evolutionary "ebb and flow" of UTP14 makes for an interesting
3
story and I think this would be interesting to readers. I had only two relatively minor suggestions
to improve the manuscript:
1) In addition to inheriting the spiced exonic sequence of the parental gene, a retrogene will
normally be flanked by target site duplications (TSDs). By analyzing the TSDs associated with
each retrogene, the author could further solidify some of the relationships (e.g. if several UTP14
retrogenes share the same TSD sequence they will likely also share a recent common ancestor).
2) More recent pseudogene literature could be cited in the introduction. There are for example
some relevant papers reporting recent pseudogene polymorphisms in human populations (e.g.
PMID: 23497673).

We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement

Please note that we cannot publish your manuscript without these end statements included. We
have included a screenshot example of the end statements for reference. If you feel that a given
heading is not relevant to your paper, please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state
that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 25-Oct-2017). If you do not think

ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account

4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-171049)
I have addressed the reviewers comments and added the required disclosures.
Reviewer 1.
I have introduced evidence of biological function into the introduction.
Reviewer 2.
I have searched for target site duplications without success. They either do not occur ore are
degraded to the point of being unrecognizable with time. These would have been useful for
identifying homology within groups where sequence data is incomplete.
I have added the suggested reference in the conclusions as evidence that retrogenes and
associated structural variation within mammalian genomes may be useful for resolving
phylogenetic relationships.
