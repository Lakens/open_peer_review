Title:Low reversed cyclic loading tests for integrated precast structure of lightweight wall with
single-row reinforcement under a lightweight steel frame
General comments: This paper presents the low reversed cyclic loading tests about the integrated
precast structure of lightweight recycled concrete wall with single-row reinforcement under a
lightweight steel frame. The failure modes, hysteretic curves, skeleton curves, ductility and
energy dissipation capacity of the frame were analyzed in detail. The research is meaningful for
the development of precast structures for the low-rise residential buildings. The paper has some
originality and research meaning. However, the research on the integrated precast structure of
lightweight wall with single-row reinforcement under a lightweight steel frame in this paper is
not deep enough specific, especially the theoretical analysis. Therefore, this manuscript must be
augmenting the theoretical analysis on the integrated precast structure, for example, the
calculation method of the horizontal bearing capacity of the specimens. In view of this, the
manuscript needs to be reviewed again.
Besides, other evaluations and questions about this manuscript are as follow:
1) In introduction of the manuscript, the descriptive analysis on the research status of new precast
structures is not enough. The content should be supplemented in the paper.
2) In order to understand the construction of the specimens better, the pictures of dimensions and
structures of the specimens are better drew with 3D drawing software.
3) In Chapter 2.2,the photos of nine specimens of integrated precast structure should be listed in
the paper in order to have a more intuitive understanding in the preparation of the experiment.
4) The figure of the arrangement of the measurement points on specimens was not well made, the
authors are invited to redo.
5) How much is the axial compression ratio of the specimen? How to determine its value?
6) Fig. 10 is not clear, the author needs to update. The analysis of the hysteresis curve of the
specimens was not detailed enough. In particular, the effect of design parameters on hysteretic
curves of specimens.
7) In Table 4, How to define the ductility factor ? How to determine the yield load and ultimate
load of specimens? Based on table 4, the ductility of most of the specimens is more than 3, which
means that the ductility of the specimens is good. But from the hysteresis curves, the deformation
capacity of the specimen is not good enough. How to explain this contradiction?
8) How to calculate the initial stiffness of the specimen in Fig. 12?
9) How to evaluate the energy dissipation capacity of the specimens?
10) The conclusion of the paper was tedious and needs refining.
11) The text displays some mistakes in grammar, so the language expression of this
manuscript must be modified for improving the standard of English.

This manuscript presents the results of an experimental study on nine integrated precast wall
specimens under cyclic loading. The test results showed that the integrated precast walls
exhibited good seismic resistance and possessed “two seismic lines of defense”. The topic of the
study is interesting and valuable to the practice. However, the manuscript has not been written
well enough and some of the English is difficult to understand. The authors are suggested to
improve the manuscript before it can be accepted. More specifically, the authors are suggested to
address the following comments when revising the manuscript:
1. Abstract: the authors stated that “the recycled concrete increases the seismic resistance of the
structure”. However, no comparison was make on two structures with and without recycled
concrete and how was this conclusion drawn?
2. More details on the recycled concrete aggregates (e.g., how and where were they obtained?
What was the original compressive strength?) should be provided.
3. The authors stated that the precast walls have lightweight steel pipes and lightweight concrete.
How did the authors define “lightweight”? To what were they compared to be “lightweight”?
Please elaborate on this issue.
4. Section 2.1: More detailed descriptions (e.g., using figures) on the concealed bracing (rebar
bracing and steel plate bracing) should be given. What were the shapes and dimensions of the
steel plates? How were the steel plates connected to the “frame plate”?
5. X1 and X2 in Figure 6 should be swapped?
6. Page 8, Line 29: “the loading was repeated until the horizontal loading dropped to less than
85% of the peak value”. However, from Figure 10, it seems that the residual loads are far less than
85% of the peak values. Please explain this inconsistence.
7. How could we see the “two seismic lines of defense” from the test results or the hysteretic
load-displacement curves of the test specimens? A detailed explanation on this term is necessary.
8. A comparison of the specimens with different rebar spacing values (i.e., comparison between
envelope curves of B1, B2, and B3) is suggested.
9. Conclusion #3: Why did the rebar bracing work better with recycled concrete?
10. Conclusions: Too many detailed conclusions were drawn by the authors. It is suggested that
only general and/or important conclusions be listed.

A new type of structure consisting of lightweight recycled concrete wall and lightweight steel
frame infilled with recycled concrete was developed. The low-cycle cyclic loading tests on nine
specimens were carried out to verify the seismic performance. It is a good idea to integrate the
two different structures into a new one with improved performance. The work is valuable. The
following comments are for the improvement of the manuscript:
1. The English writing could be improved.
2. There is no Figure 1 in the paper.
3. The lines in Figure 10 are too thick.
4. In Table 4 it is not reasonable to adopt the failure displacement to determine the ductility
coefficient. At that point the remaining load-carrying capacity is too low.
5. In the last part of conclusions it could be better if how the parameters in the three groups of
specimens affect the seismic performance of this type of new structure is provided.

All my concerns have been addressed by the authors in the revised version.
Appendix A
Reviewer: 1
1) In introduction of the manuscript, the descriptive analysis on the research status of
new precast structures is not enough. The content should be supplemented in the
paper.
Answer: The content has been supplemented in “Introduction”,
at line 87-111 (Yellow marking).
2) In order to understand the construction of the specimens better, the pictures of
dimensions and structures of the specimens are better drew with 3D drawing software.
Answer: Please see Figure 1a: 3D dimensions and structures, in line 216-251.
3) In Chapter 2.2,the photos of nine specimens of integrated precast structure should
be listed in the paper in order to have a more intuitive understanding in the preparation
of the experiment.
Answer: Please see Figure 4: Loading site of the specimens (nine specimens), in line
325-348.
4) The figure of the arrangement of the measurement points on specimens was not well
made, the authors are invited to redo.
Answer: Please see Figure 6: Arrangement of the measurement points: (a) Outer frame
and (b) Steel skeleton of the wall, in line 364-369.
5) How much is the axial compression ratio of the specimen? How to determine its
value?
Answer: The axial compressive ratio of the column—0.35 to be exact—was determined
in accordance with the standard value of the material strength. Therefore, it
represented the experimental ratio. If the calculation was carried out in light of the
designed value, the axial compressive ratio would stand at 0.59. (in line 302-305).
6) Fig. 10 is not clear, the author needs to update. The analysis of the hysteresis curve
of the specimens was not detailed enough. In particular, the effect of design
parameters on hysteretic curves of specimens.
Answer: Please see Figure 10, in line 541-570.
The analysis of the hysteresis curve of the specimens: It can be observed in Figure 10
that given the butterfly shape of the hysteretic curves obtained, the structure displays
two distinct seismic lines of defence: the lightweight recycled-concrete wall with single-
row reinforcement and the lightweight steel pipe frame filled with recycled concrete. As
the lightweight recycled-concrete wall with single-row reinforcement gradually phases
out its role of force bearing, the hysteretic curves descend rapidly. As the curve
reaches the lower limit of force bearing, the first line of defence failed and the second
line—the lightweight steel frame—worked with the concealed bracing—either rebar
bracing or steel-plate bracing—forming a truss system of force bearing. In other words,
the setting of the bracing leads to fuller hysteretic curves. Because the bond strength
between rebars and recycled concrete exceeds that between steel plates and recycled
concrete, it can be concluded that the rebar bracing outshines its counterpart in energy
consumption, making it a preferable design. It should be noted that smaller spacing
between the arranged rebars translates into fuller hysteretic curves and higher energy
consumption.
7) In Table 4, How to define the ductility factor ? How to determine the yield load and
ultimate load of specimens? Based on table 4, the ductility of most of the specimens is
more than 3, which means that the ductility of the specimens is good. But from the
hysteresis curves, the deformation capacity of the specimen is not good enough. How
to explain this contradiction?
Answer:
The cracking status refers to the loading and displacement observed as more minor
cracks start to appear on the wall. The peak status and failure status are determined
based on the data collected, and the yielding status is calculated using the energy
equivalence method.
The paper takes reference from the rules on displacement ductility ratio specified in the
Specification of Test Methods for Earthquake Resistant Buildings (JGJ101-1996,1996)
to study the ductility performance of the specimens. To be more specific, the
displacement ductility ratio is as follows:
µ=<U+0394>u/<U+0394>y (1)
where the elastic–plastic displacement of the specimens <U+0394>u represents the
displacement as the horizontal loading drops to 85% of the peak values (Fm), and <U+0394>y is
the yield displacement.
The calculation of ductility ratio according to formula (1), ductility ratio has been
revised in Table 4.(in line 613-614)
The rebar bracing elevates the overall performance of the structure, which then
translates into better ductility. On the other hand, given the limited bond strength of
the plate-type bracing and the recycled concrete, the plate-type bracing undermines
the deformation performance of the structure. Exceedingly wide spacing can undermine
the integrity and ductility of the overall specimens.
8) How to calculate the initial stiffness of the specimen in Fig. 12?
Answer:
Secant stiffness Ki of the specimen is calculated as follows:
(2)
where:
i is cyclic progression; Ki is the secant stiffness at cyclic progression i;
Fi is the loading peak at cyclic progression i;
<U+0394>i is the displacement at cyclic progression i;
+ or – is the positive or negative direction of horizontal force, respectively.
9) How to evaluate the energy dissipation capacity of the specimens?
Answer:
The total area of the hysteretic curves is introduced to measure the energy absorption
of the specimen subject to repeated seismic influence, and the accumulated energy
consumption is calculated by adding the area of each hysteretic curve obtained at the
characteristic points amid and prior to cyclic loading.
10) The conclusion of the paper was tedious and needs refining.
Answer: The conclusion of the paper has been refined. Please see 817-845.
11) The text displays some mistakes in grammar, so the language expression of this
manuscript must be modified for improving the standard of English.
Answer: The language expression of this manuscript has been modified.
Besides, the theoretical analysis was supplemented, please see “3.7 Force-bearing
Analysis of the Inclined Section” in the article. (in line 726-824)
Reviewer: 2
1) Abstract: the authors stated that “the recycled concrete increases the seismic
resistance of the structure”. However, no comparison was make on two structures with
and without recycled concrete and how was this conclusion drawn?
Answer: The research team compared the performance of recycle-concrete-filled steel-
pipe frame to that of a steel pipe frame (with no concrete filling) of the same dimension
and manufacture by the same technique. And the results show that the former
promises much better performance in terms of seismic resistance.

2) More details on the recycled concrete aggregates (e.g., how and where were they
obtained? What was the original compressive strength?) should be provided.
Answer:
The recycled concrete filled inside the steel pipe—identical to the concrete of the wall—
was made of recycled coarse aggregate with a grain size of 5–10 mm (replacement rate
100%), natural sand, ordinary Portland cement, water, mineral powder, fly ash, and
water reducer. All ingredients were mixed at a pre-defined ratio in a mixer. Table 2
presents the mechanical performance of the recycled concrete measured onsite.

3) The authors stated that the precast walls have lightweight steel pipes and
lightweight concrete. How did the authors define “lightweight”? To what were they
compared to be “lightweight”? Please elaborate on this issue.
Answer:
The lightweight steel pipe – a term determined in accordance with Technical

In this paper, “lightweight” refers to walls that registers limited weight per unit volume.
The reason is that the wall is made of recycled concrete and only one row of
reinforcement. Therefore, it is a rather thin panel, the thickness of which (60mm) is
much less than that of reinforced concrete walls in general (at least 160mm in
thickness).
4) Section 2.1: More detailed descriptions (e.g., using figures) on the concealed bracing
(rebar bracing and steel plate bracing) should be given. What were the shapes and
dimensions of the steel plates? How were the steel plates connected to the “frame
plate”?
Answer:
The steel skeleton of the wall was composed of 4-mm-thick and 40-mm-wide frame
plates, 5-mm-diameter rebars for both directions, and concealed bracing—either rebar
bracing or plate-type bracing. In the steel skeleton, the concealed bracings were
arranged at both sides of the single-row reinforcement in a crisscrossed fashion and
then fastened by 1-mm-diameter steel wires. It should be noted that bracing could also
be welded to the reinforcement for engineering application. The cross section of the
plate-type bracing—40 mm in height and 4 mm in thickness—was identical to that of
the rebar bracing—10 mm in diameter—in terms of total area. The frame plate of the
wall with bolt holes was connected to the steel lathings of the beams and columns via
M10 bolts.
The steel lathings, with a thickness of 4 mm and a height of 40 mm, were welded to
the frame columns and frame beams for connection to the wall. In other words, the
lathings on the columns and the beams were bolted to the bar-type steel plates of the
recycled-concrete wall with single-row reinforcement. The construction is shown in
Figure1a
5) X1 and X2 in Figure 6 should be swapped?
Answer: Yes, has been revised in Figure 6a.
6) Page 8, Line 29: “the loading was repeated until the horizontal loading dropped to
less than 85% of the peak value”. However, from Figure 10, it seems that the residual
loads are far less than 85% of the peak values. Please explain this inconsistence.
Answer: The loading cycle was then repeated once until the experiment ended, at
which point, the specimen failed, it was impossible to continue the loading, or the
horizontal loading dropped to less than 85% of the peak value.
7) How could we see the “two seismic lines of defense” from the test results or the
hysteretic load-displacement curves of the test specimens? A detailed explanation on
this term is necessary.
Answer: It can be observed in Figure 10 that given the butterfly shape of the hysteretic
curves obtained, the structure displays two distinct seismic lines of defence: the
lightweight recycled-concrete wall with single-row reinforcement and the lightweight
steel pipe frame filled with recycled concrete. As the lightweight recycled-concrete wall
with single-row reinforcement gradually phases out its role of force bearing, the
hysteretic curves descend rapidly. As the curve reaches the lower limit of force bearing,
the first line of defence failed and the second line—the lightweight steel frame—worked
with the concealed bracing—either rebar bracing or steel-plate bracing—forming a truss
system of force bearing.
8) A comparison of the specimens with different rebar spacing values (i.e., comparison
between envelope curves of B1, B2, and B3) is suggested.
Answer: It should be noted that the decrease of the reinforcement spacing leads to a
surge in crack loading, yield loading, and loading peak, whereas the widening of the
spacing most affects crack loading, because the smaller spacing of arranged
reinforcement results in closer and more evenly distributed cracks, the width of which
is evidently smaller. Exceedingly wide spacing can undermine the integrity and ductility
of the overall specimens.
9) Conclusion #3: Why did the rebar bracing work better with recycled concrete?
Answer: Because the bond strength between rebars and recycled concrete exceeds that
between steel plates and recycled concrete, it can be concluded that the rebar bracing
outshines its counterpart in energy consumption, making it a preferable design.
10) Conclusions: Too many detailed conclusions were drawn by the authors. It is
suggested that only general and or important conclusions be listed.
Answer: The conclusion of the paper has been refined. Please see 817-845.
Besides, the language expression of this manuscript has been modified.

4) In Table 4 it is not reasonable to adopt the failure displacement to determine the
ductility coefficient. At that point the remaining load-carrying capacity is too low.
Answer: In Table 4, the ductility coefficient has been revised.
The paper takes reference from the rules on displacement ductility ratio specified in the
Specification of Test Methods for Earthquake Resistant Buildings (JGJ101-1996,1996)
to study the ductility performance of the specimens. To be more specific, the
displacement ductility ratio is as follows:
µ=<U+0394>u/<U+0394>y (1)
where the elastic–plastic displacement of the specimens <U+0394>u represents the
displacement as the horizontal loading drops to 85% of the peak values (Fm), and <U+0394>y is
the yield displacement.
5) In the last part of conclusions it could be better if how the parameters in the three
groups of specimens affect the seismic performance of this type of new structure is
provided.
Answer: In the last part of conclusions have been revised.
(1) Amid the process of force bearing, the recycled concrete wall withstands the shear
force, and the lightweight steel frame bears the vertical loading. The structure shows
two distinct seismic lines of defence, with the first being the lightweight recycled
concrete wall restrained by the lightweight steel frame and the second being the
lightweight steel frame. In the case of seismic incidence, the first line plays an
important role in sliding resistance, but its role gradually declines as the damage
increases. Afterwards, the lightweight steel frame bears the loading. Because of the
well-structured design, the integrated structure can absorb the seismic energy at each
stage. Because of the rib-reinforced joints connecting the lightweight steel pipe beams
and columns (filled with recycled concrete), the specimens exhibited better
performance in terms of both bending resistance and distortion resistance at the beam–
column joints.
(2) The setting of the bracing leads to fuller curves. Because the bond strength
between rebars and recycled concrete exceeds that of between steel plates and
recycled concrete, it can be concluded that the rebar bracing outshines its counterpart
in energy consumption. In addition, the rebar bracing elevates the overall performance
of the structure, which then translates into better ductility, and the plate-type bracing
undermines the deformation performance of the structure. Therefore, the rebar bracing
design stands out as a preferable choice.
(3) The smaller spacing of reinforcement results in closer and more evenly distributed
cracks, the width of which is evidently smaller. Therefore, the decrease of the
reinforcement spacing leads to a surge in crack loading, yield loading, and loading
peak, and the widening of the spacing most affects crack loading. Exceedingly wide
spacing can undermine both the integrity and the ductility of the overall specimens.
(4) The average displacement angle between elastic–plastic layers of the integrated
structure of precast lightweight steel frame–lightweight wall is 1/24, which means that
the structure promises good performance in force bearing, ductility, and energy
consumption. In engineering application, 1/24 can be introduced as the critical
controlling parameter for collapse resistance.
