Dear Authors
In your report you demonstrated the results of investigation of physicochemical properties of
Dicationic Ionic Liquids, such of [C4(MIM)2][PF6]2, [C5(MIM)2][PF6]2, [C6(MIM)2][PF6]2 and
[C4(PYR)2][PF6]2. Results are useful and required for the chemists working with ILs.
Unfortunately, several comments and questions appeared after reading manuscript.
Title
In my opinion Title of manuscript does not demonstrates the main goal of your investigation. I
suggest to change Title, for example, Synthesis and investigation of physicochemical properties of
dicationic ionic liquids.
Introduction
The main goal of investigation should be described in detail. At present the main problems in
chemistry of studied IL are unclear
Results and discussion
- Page 3, Lines 20-21. You wrote that “As mentioned in the experimental section, yields of ionic
liquids followed the order of [C6(MIM)2][PF6]2 (90.39%) >[C4(MIM)2][PF6]2 (73.66%)
>[C5(MIM)2][PF6]2 (57.66%)”. I am not sure that you can write 77.66 or 90.39%, because the low
precision of measurement. Probably, it should be 90, 78 and 58%
-
- Figure2 (Miscibility of dicationic ILs and water at different temperatures). In this Figure you
demonstrated correlations between amount content (ml) and temperature. It will be better to re-
build Y-axis as ratio of H2O/ILs (g/ml or g/g)
- Figure3. Caption is unclear. As I understand you allocate IL from ILs/H2O solution at 100oC by
cooling solution. Note that amount of H2O in mixture should be added
I suggest to revise, for example, The recovery of dicationic ILs
- Figure 4 (Miscibility of dicationic ILs with water and acetonitrile at room temperature). Figure is
unclear. I think that this Figure can be deleted.

In this manuscript, Sun, Y. et al. prepared a series of dicationic ionic liquids and investigated the
miscibilities of these ionic liquids with water. They tested the thermal stability and melting points
of these ionic liquids and studied their solubilities and recovery rates. In this re-submitted
version, authors didn't address my previous comments seriously and properly. The writing is
worse, and authors even didn't delete the journal template instruction in the second paragraph.
Many spaces between words are missed. More importantly, in my previous comments, I asked
the authors to explain why monocationic pyridinium-based ILs had higher decomposition
temperature than that of dicationic pyridinium-based ILs with the same anion, while dicationic
imidazolium-based ILs had higher decomposition temperatures than that of monocationic
imidazolium-based ILs. It is not a suitable way to address this comment by simply deleting the
discussion of the decomposition temperatures of monocationic and dicationic pyridinium-based
ILs. Based on the above comments, I don't consider this manuscript as a serious scientific paper.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers,
Thank you for your advice. All advice is important to us. We have corrected all
the contents according to reviewers’ suggestions. We also did further
experiments. We really appreciated if you can give us an opportunity. Thank you
for your help.
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer 1:
Title
In my opinion Title of manuscript does not demonstrates the main goal of your
investigation. I suggest to change Title, for example, Synthesis and investigation
of physicochemical properties of dicationic ionic liquids.
Introduction
The main goal of investigation should be described in detail. At present the main
problems in chemistry of studied IL are unclear.
Results and discussion
- Page 3, Lines 20-21. You wrote that “As mentioned in the experimental section,
yields of ionic liquids followed the order of [C6(MIM)2][PF6]2
(90.39%) >[C4(MIM)2][PF6]2 (73.66%) >[C5(MIM)2][PF6]2 (57.66%)”. I am not
sure that you can write 77.66 or 90.39%, because the low precision of
measurement. Probably, it should be 90, 78 and 58%.
- Figure 2. (Miscibility of dicationic ILs and water at different temperatures). In
this Figure you demonstrated correlations between amount content (ml) and
temperature. It will be better to re-build Y-axis as ratio of H2O/ILs (g/ml or g/g).
- Figure 3. Caption is unclear. As I understand you allocate IL from ILs/H2O
solution at 100 oC by cooling solution. Note that amount of H2O in mixture
should be added.
I suggest to revise, for example, The recovery of dicationic ILs.
- Figure 4. (Miscibility of dicationic ILs with water and acetonitrile at room
temperature). Figure is unclear. I think that this Figure can be deleted.
1. Answer: we have changed the title as “Synthesis and Investigation of
Physicochemical Properties of Dicationic Ionic Liquids”.
2. Answer: we re-write the introductions and make the reach goal clearer.
3. Answer: we have corrected the data as “90%, 78%, 58%”.
4. Answer: we have re-build the Y-axis of Figure 2 as the ratio of H2O/ILs (g/g).
5. Answer: we have corrected the caption of Figure 3 as suggested.
6. Answer: Figure 4 was deleted as suggested.
Reviewer 2:
In this manuscript, Sun, Y. et al. prepared a series of dicationic ionic liquids and
investigated the miscibilities of these ionic liquids with water. They tested the
thermal stability and melting points of these ionic liquids and studied their
solubilities and recovery rates. In this re-submitted version, authors didn't
address my previous comments seriously and properly. The writing is worse, and
authors even didn't delete the journal template instruction in the second
paragraph. Many spaces between words are missed. More importantly, in my
previous comments, I asked the authors to explain why monocationic
pyridinium-based ILs had higher decomposition temperature than that of
dicationic pyridinium-based ILs with the same anion, while dicationic
imidazolium-based ILs had higher decomposition temperatures than that of
monocationic imidazolium-based ILs. It is not a suitable way to address this
comment by simply deleting the discussion of the decomposition temperatures of
monocationic and dicationic pyridinium-based ILs. Based on the above
comments, I don't consider this manuscript as a serious scientific paper.
Answer:
We are really sorry about the version of the manuscript. When we uploaded our
manuscript, all the formations of the file were changed, because we used a
“WPS” word system, leading to the missing of many spaces between words. It is
our fault and we are sorry for the inconvenience to read. We really appreciate
you still could give us an opportunity.
Thank you for your previous comments. You asked us to explain why
monocationic pyridinium-based ILs had higher decomposition temperature than
that of dicationic pyridinium-based ILs with the same anion, while dicationic
imidazolium-based ILs had higher decomposition temperatures than that of
monocationic imidazolium-based ILs. It is really not a suitable way to simply
deleting the discussion. However, could you give us an opportunity to explain it
please?
In our original manuscript, we described the above discussion, because wecited a
literature (Mahrova M, Pagano F, Pejakovic V, Valea A, Kalin M, Igartua A,
Tojoet E. 2015 Pyridinium based dicationic ionic liquids as base lubricants or
lubricant additives. Tribol. Int.82,245–54. doi:10.1016/j.triboint.2014.10.018). In
this paper, it was described that “dicationic ILs were found to be less stable than
those monocationic ILs.” For example, “monocationic [C1Py][C1SO4] present
the Td,onset at 601 K, the DIL (dicationic) [C1Py(CH2OCH2)3C1Py][C1SO4]2
shows the Td,onset at 483K. Monocationic [C1Py][NTf2] presented the Td,onset at
704 K, the DIL (dicationic) [C1Py(CH2OCH2)3C1Py][NTf2] shows the Td,onset at
483 K.” However, the author emphasized “Unexpected results were observed”
with these two ILs, because very few pyridinium-based ionic liquids were found
in this case compared with most other literatures. These dicationic
pyridinium-based ILs have low thermal stability, because there is an ether bond
in the linkage chain of their dications that is unstable, which are different with
the chemical structure of ILs in our work. Thus, we cited wrong information in
our original manuscript and that is why we deleted the discussion in the
re-submitted manuscript. Fortunately, you help us to find our mistake and thank
you very much for your reminding.
In order to identify the thermal stability of monocationic ILs and dicationic ILs
for both imidazolium based ILs and pyridinium based ILs, we did further
experiments to confirm this. In our work, [C4(MIM)]PF6 presented Tonset at
426–427 oC. Dicationic imidazolium-based ILs generated the thermal stability in
a range of 443–445 oC, which were higher than monocationic ILs. In a similar
case, dicationic [C4(PYR)2][PF6]2 exhibited Tonset at 414 oC, which was higher
than monocationic [C4(PYR)]PF6 at 395–396 oC. It was reported that the thermal
stability of 39 types of dicationic ionic liquids were found to be significantly
higher than those that have been observed for many traditional
imdazolium-based ionic liquids. (Anderson JL, Ding R, Ellern A, Armstrong DW.
2005 Structure and properties of high stability geminal dicationic ionic liquids. J.
Am. Chem. Soc.127,593–604. doi:10.1021/ja046521u). In their paper, the highest
thermal stability (> 400 oC was obtained with [C9(mpy)2]NTf2
(1-methylpyrrolidinium dication) and the lowest decomposition temperature
(330 oC) was observed for [C9(bpy)2]NTf2 (1-butylpyrrolidium dication. Our
work was consistent with Dr. Anderson et al. We have described all data in the
manuscript. Thank you.
Your advice is very important to us. We really appreciate for all your help.

Introduction
I suggest to specify the main goal of your investigation. For example, “The main goal of this
investigation was to increase knowledge in physicochemical properties of dicationic Ionic
Liquids. The main attentions were focused on the investigations (a) its thermal stability, (b) its
melting points and (c) its solubility in water and water-organic mixtures. All these parameters
can be important in a future their applying as solvents or catalysts”.
We have corrected the Introduction according to reviewer’s advices.
Thank you for your help.
Figure3 was not revised. What do you mean when write “IL recovery rate” (Y-axis)? Percent
(%) can be dimension of rate (!!!).
We have modified Figure 3 and re-write the contents in 4.6.

- Page 1, Lines 29-32. You added phrase “The recovered ILs by altering the
temperature were obtained in high yields of [C4(MIM)2][PF6]2 (0.98 g),
[C5(MIM)2][PF6]2 (0.97 g), [C6(MIM)2][PF6]2 (0.98 g) and [C4(PYR)2][PF6]2 (0.94
g).”. I suggest to write percentage yield.
- Page 4, Lines 42-44. You wrote “As shown in Figure 3, high yields of
[C4(MIM)2][PF6]2 (0.98 g), [C5(MIM)2][PF6]2 (0.97 g), [C6(MIM)2][PF6]2 (0.98 g)
and [C4(PYR)2][PF6]2 (0.94 g) were achieved.” I suggest to write percentage yield
Answer: We have corrected the Page 1 and Page 4 according to reviewer’s
advices. Page 1 “The recovered ILs by altering the temperature were obtained in
high percentage yields of [C4(MIM)2][PF6]2 (97.6%), [C5(MIM)2][PF6]2 (97.3%),
[C6(MIM)2][PF6]2 (98.0%) and [C4(PYR)2][PF6]2 (94.2%).” Page 4 “As shown in
Figure 3, high percentage yields of [C4(MIM)2][PF6]2 (97.6%), [C5(MIM)2][PF6]2
(97.3%), [C6(MIM)2][PF6]2 (98.0%) and [C4(PYR)2][PF6]2 (94.2%) were achieved.”
- Figure3 was revised; however, it will be better to write “Yield, (%)”.
Answer: We have modified Figure 3 and Y-axis is revised to “Yields of
recovered ILs (%)”
If we still have mistake to understand the coments at this time, could you help us
to tell us in more detail please, and we will try our best to correct it. Thank you for
all your help. Thank you for your help.
