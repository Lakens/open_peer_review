This work reported a new fabricated process of alginate microfibers with grooves via microfluidic
spinning technique, and further discussed the formation mechanism of this grooved-structure.
This work is interesting and have the chances to be published in Royal Society Open Science after
minor revision considering the followings.
1. Why the author utilized the microfluidic spinning technology? What are the advantages of
microfluidic spinning technology compared with conventional spinning technology?
2. Some important references, which is significant in microfluidic synthesis of fibers should be

This manuscript was transferred from RSC Advances with previous review comments. While the
authors have addressed some concerns in the previous referees' reports, as a new referee I agree
with much of the previous referees' comments and feel that the revised manuscript did not
address the major concerns.
My major concern is that the main purpose of this study is not clear, therefore dramatically
dilutes the novelty of the report in its current format. The authors acknowledge in the response
letter that MST is a well characterized and widely reported technique, and the novelty in the
3
current study is to include a collector, with the control of rotation rate etc, to form fibers and
potential dressing structure with further cross-linking. Including a collector for MST is not
impressive, but if that makes big difference, the main content of the report should be how the this
new addition has made the fiber differently (better efficiency? new feature?). On the other hand,
if the report wants to focus on the grooved feature on individual fibers (as the title hints), the
authors should report extensively with experimental data and series discussion on the
mechanism of the groove formation (the current discussion is very brief and not convincing
without data to support the vague claim of double diffusion, e.g., how the double diffusion create
the groove surface?). On the other hand, extensive characterization of the individual fibers and
polymer solutions is nothing new and unnecessary. Rather it gives the impression of a lousy
study with clumsy data but without careful plan.
Now talking about the potential dressing structure, how will these be different from a previous
paper that has fabricated the alginate microfiber with grooves for scaffolds by MST in one step
(Advanced Materials 24.31 (2012): 4271-4277)? Obviously, the word groove in that paper and this
manuscript means differently (the dressing sheet vs. shrinkage of individual fiber surface). I
don't see how the fiber in this report is characterized as 3D as claimed by the authors while the
groove sheet in that paper is 2D.
Meanwhile, some more revisions are required as below for possible re-submission:
Q1. The dimension of the microfluidic channels should be measured, which influences the size of
alginate fibers and its grooves. Also, the design of spinneret as shown in Figure 1 (c), especially
how CaCl2 and alginate meet, should be stated clearly. This would be one of the possible reasons
for grooves formation.
Q2. The authors thought reasons for grooves are the shrinkage of alginate fiber after solvent
evaporation and the double diffusion between CaCl2 and alginate solution. But there is no
evidence or experiments to prove it, which is strongly needed.
Q3. In discussion 3.3, the stated working conditions were fuzzy and confusing in each case, which
makes conclusion unconvincing. In Figure 4, what were the core and sheath flow rates when the
concentration of alginate varied? In Figure 5, what was the concentration of alginate and CaCl2,
and which flow rate was varied as the value shown on images?
Q4. There are problems in figures. There is no discussion about Figure 10 and what does the y
axis mean in Figure 10? In Figure 11, all three graphs should have the same axis range that can
clearly show the difference. Distinct figure explanation should be applied in Figure 12.
Q5. In authors’ design, ethanol was used as solvent for the sheath flow, 3% (w/v) CaCl2, to
induce the gelation of alginate. Therefore there is ethanol residua in the generated alginate fiber.
But ethanol should be avoided in applications for cell culture like wound dressing or tissue
scaffold because of cytotoxicity. There may be problem in its possible biomedical applications.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors represent a way to fabricate alginate hydrogel fiber based on concentration and flow
rate. However, the data was not represented and poorly organized. The author should largely
improve the format.
1. The author mentioned the viscosity dependent fabrication of microfiber. From Figure 5a, it
looks like these parameters affect the cross-section morphology of fibers. Can the author show a
cross-section projection image, how it was being affected by concentrations and flow rates.
2. In figure 6 caption, the author mentioned the “curvature of fiber diameter”, but in the figure, it
is only the diameter. I just wonder what will be the curvature. And does the curvature on the
microfiber is uniform?
3. What does Figure 7 provide? it looks like it just saying “the alginate fiber is alginate“
4. The same story with XRD. What does it provide?
5. The authors claimed that they have a groove structure on fiber from Figure 9. But their scale is
even in tens of micron. We can not see any micron or submicron structure. SEM can easily go to
sub micron and nanometers, please do a better image of fibers.
6. Figure 10 has a similar information to Figure 6.
7. Does AFM image on Figure 11 only show one groove on the fiber? But that scale is too large for
a single groove. If it is the fiber? It is too small for a single fiber shown in Figure 10.

LOA: Results and discussions
LOA 2: Discussion 3.1: “How CaCl2 and alginate meet as shown in Figure 1 (c)?”
has been added and highlighted in the manuscript.
As shown in Figure 1(c), alginate solution and CaCl2 solution was orderly pumped
into syringe, PTFE tubes and microfluidic channels, then both solutions in the end of
micro-channels would meet to form the fibers. That was the result of chelation between
the carboxyl group of alginate molecular chain and the calcium ion of CaCl2 solution
to make alginate form the “egg-box” structure. The buckled chain of guluronic acid
units acting as a two-dimensional analogue of corrugated egg-box with interstices in
the calcium ions packed and coordinated to form fiber.
LOA 3: Discussion 3.1: “The dimension of the microfluidic channels?” has been
added and highlight in the manuscript.
Spinning solution consisted of alginate solution as the core flow and CaCl2
solution acted as the sheath flow, were respectively loaded into two syringes (10 ml)
mounted a 23 G and 17G stainless steel needle. The diameter of core and sheath channel
was 340 µm and 490 µm, respectively.
LOA 4: Discussion 3.3: “In Figure 4, what were the core and sheath flow rates
when the concentration of alginate varied?” has been added and highlighted in the
manuscript.
Morphological structure of fibers fabricated by various alginate concentration
were investigated as displayed in Figure 4, with core and sheath flow rates being 1.5
mL/min and 3 mL/min.
LOA 5: Discussion 3.3: “In Figure 5, what was the concentration of alginate and
CaCl2? ” has been added and highlighted in the manuscript.
Morphological structure of fibers fabricated by diverse flow rates were
investigated as displayed in Figure 5, with the concentration of alginate and CaCl2
solution being 2% and 3%.
LOA 6: Discussion 3.3: “In Figure 5: which flow rate was varied as the value shown
on images? ” has been added and highlighted in the manuscript.
The diameter of fiber increased from 31.98±0.83 µm to 47.72±1.15 µm as the core
and sheath flow rates varied from1.5 mL/min to 6.5 mL/min, as shown in Figure 5.
LOA 7: Discussion 3.3: “Can the author show a cross-section projection image,
how it was being affected by concentrations and flow rates? ” has been added and
highlighted in the manuscript.
The morphology structure of alginate fiber clearly demonstrated that polymer
concentration and flow rates not only affected the fibrous diameter, but also acted as
the key parameter to the processing. Hence, the cross-section morphology of fibers
fabricated by various concentration of alginate solution and flow rates were investigated.
As shown in Figure 7 and 8, the cross-section of fibers was circular with a sunken
segment and the grooves could be observed, which was affected by the alginate
concentration and flow rates. The dimension of grooves increased with an increasing in
the alginate solution and flow rates under a certain condition, and then exhibited a
decreased tendency. The bigger alginate concentration and flow rates improved the rate
of double diffusion, resulting in the clear grooves. However, fibers formed quickly with
the concentration and flow rates being high, impeding the double diffusion. That was
not beneficial to the formation of grooves.
Figure 7. Cross-section images of fibers fabricated by various alginate solution
Figure 8. Cross-section images of fibers fabricated at diverse flow rates
LOA 8: Discussion 3.6: “Characterization of the fibers diameter and surface
structure” has been amended and highlighted in the manuscript.
The surface structure and diameter distribution of fibers fabricated by 1%, 1.5%
and 2% alginate solution were analyzed by SEM and Image Pro Plus software, as
described in Figure 11 and Figure 12. It could be clearly observed that the surface of all
the fibers exhibited grooved structure and the fiber fabricated with higher alginate
concentration demonstrated bigger depth and width of grooves, as depicted in Figure
11. The rate of ion-exchange between Ca2+ and Na+ was proportional to concentration
of polymer, impacting on the formation of fibers and grooves. The higher concentration
resulted in the larger ion-exchange rate, inducing the faster forming process of grooves
and then generating the bigger dimension of grooves.
LOA 9: Discussion 3.6: “There is no discussion about Figure 10?” has been
corrected and highlighted in the manuscript.
The diameter distribution of fibers fabricated by the concentration of 1%, 1.5%
and 2% alginate were exhibited in Figure 12. It could be found that the diameter of 1%
alginate fiber was chiefly between 23 µm and 26 µm, whereas that of 1.5% alginate
fiber being mainly around 27 µm. For 2% alginate fiber, the diameter was widespread,
ranging from 29 µm to 32 µm. It could be clearly found that the diameter distribution
of fibers was proportional to the alginate concentration. Overall, the fibrous diameter
exhibited an increasing tendency with increasing the alginate polymer solution.

alginate solutions
LOA 10: Discussion 3.6: “The authors claimed that they have a groove structure
on fiber from Figure 9. But their scale is even in tens of micron. We can not see
any micron or submicron structure. SEM can easily go to sub micron and
nanometers, please do a better image of fibers?” has been corrected and
highlighted in the manuscript.

1%, (b) 1.5% and (c) 2% alginate solutions
LOA 11: Discussion 3.6: “There is no discussion about Figure 10?” has been added
and highlighted in the manuscript.
The diameter distribution of fibers fabricated by the concentration of 1%, 1.5%
and 2% alginate were exhibited in Figure 10. It could be found that the diameter of 1%
alginate fiber was chiefly between 23 µm and 26 µm, whereas that of 1.5% alginate
fiber being mainly around 27 µm. For 2% alginate fiber, the diameter was widespread,
ranging from 29 µm to 32 µm. It could be clearly found that the diameter distribution
of fibers was proportional to the alginate concentration. Overall, the fibrous diameter
exhibited an increasing tendency with increasing the alginate polymer solution.
LOA 12: Discussion 3.7: “Does AFM image on Figure 11 only show one groove on
the fiber? But that scale is too large for a single groove. If it is the fiber? It is too
small for a single fiber shown in Figure 10?” has been corrected and highlighted
in the manuscript.
The microgroove depths of 1% and 1.5% alginate fiber was 278.37±2.23 nm and
683.69±3.18 nm respectively, whilst that of 2% alginate fiber being 727.52±3.52 nm.
Furthermore, the widths of groove for 1%, 1.5% and 2% samples was 251.33±1.67 nm,
419.67±2.82 nm and 730.67±3.12 nm, respectively. AFM image on Figure 11 exhibited
one groove on the fibers, and the scan scale was between 4 µm and 10 µm, which was
determined by the width and depth of grooves. And the diameter distribution of fibers
was majorly between 20 µm and 32 µm.
LOA 13: Discussion 3.7: “the cross-section images of fibers with grooved structure”
has been added and highlighted in the manuscript.
Figure 13. SEM images of grooved structure on the fibers of 1%, 1.5% and 2%
alginate solution
LOA 14: Discussion 3.8:“Distinct figure explanation should be applied in Figure
12” has been added and highlighted in the manuscript.
As exhibited in Figure 15, the W1% and W2% was corresponding to 1.5% and 1%
alginate solution. The higher concentration of alginate solution improved the rate of
ion-exchange, promoting the double diffusion. That was more beneficial to form the
groove on fibers, as shown the bigger grooves of 1.5% alginate solution than that of 1%
in the following figures.

Comments:
This work reported a new fabricated process of alginate microfibers with grooves via
microfluidic spinning technique, and further discussed the formation mechanism of this
grooved-structure. This work is interesting and have the chances to be published in
Royal Society Open Science after minor revision considering the followings.
1. Why the author utilized the microfluidic spinning technology? What are the
advantages of microfluidic spinning technology compared with conventional spinning
technology?
As we know, melt spinning, wet spinning, and electrospinning are common
methods to produce microfibers. However, melt spinning needs bulky and heavy
equipment for its high temperature process, while the electrospinning involves volatile
organic solvents, rendering them unacceptable for the fabrication of wound dressing.
Especially, the alginate couldn’t be fabricated by the water as solvent via the
electrospinning technology. The process of wet spinning was very complicate and old,
which was not facilitate to fabricate the fibers with special structure as the core-shell,
hollow, double-layered and grooved structure, et al. However, the microfluidic spinning
technology is simple, cost-effective and compatible with biological materials and thus
an alternative method for producing the fibers with many different structure. In addition,
the microfluidic spinning devices design is simple, flexibility and efficient to fabricate
grooved microfibers using a one-step continuous process. The diameters of microfibers
and grooves could be tuned by adjusting the spinning parameters. Thus, it was the best
choice that the microfluidic spinning technology was used to fabricate the alginate
fibers with grooved structure.
2. Some important references, which is significant in microfluidic synthesis of fibers
should be cited. (Nature Communications, DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-06914-7. J.

Comments to the Author(s)
My major concern is that the main purpose of this study is not clear, therefore
dramatically dilutes the novelty of the report in its current format. The authors
acknowledge in the response letter that MST is a well characterized and widely reported
technique, and the novelty in the current study is to include a collector, with the control
of rotation rate etc, to form fibers and potential dressing structure with further cross-
linking. Including a collector for MST is not impressive, but if that makes big difference,
the main content of the report should be how this new addition has made the fiber
differently (better efficiency? new feature?). On the other hand, if the report wants to
focus on the grooved feature on individual fibers (as the title hints), the authors should
report extensively with experimental data and series discussion on the mechanism of
the groove formation (the current discussion is very brief and not convincing without
data to support the vague claim of double diffusion, e.g., how the double diffusion
create the groove surface?). On the other hand, extensive characterization of the
individual fibers and polymer solutions is nothing new and unnecessary. Rather it
gives the impression of a lousy study with clumsy data but without careful plan.
This manuscript was to fabricate the alginate fibers with groove by the
microfluidic spinning technology (MST), characterize the structure and disclose the
forming mechanism of grooves. The MST was better efficiency to fabricate fiber
dressing or fabric dressing in one step by various collector with adjustable rotation rate
and movement velocity. Furthermore, MST facilitate to fabricate fibers with new
feature including hollow, double-layered, core-shell and grooved structure et al. To
investigate the grooves on the fiber surface better, some supplementary experiment
about the grooves and some study on the fabrication of fibers and grooves have been
added and highlighted in the manuscript.
Now talking about the potential dressing structure, how will these be different from a
previous paper that has fabricated the alginate microfiber with grooves for scaffolds by
MST in one step (Advanced Materials 24.31 (2012): 4271-4277)? Obviously, the word
groove in that paper and this manuscript means differently (the dressing sheet vs.
shrinkage of individual fiber surface). I don't see how the fiber in this report is
characterized as 3D as claimed by the authors while the groove sheet in that paper is
2D.
That paper (Advanced Materials 24.31 (2012): 4271-4277) fabricated the fibers
with grooves via the design of microchannel. A PDMS slit channel with microgrooves
was fabricated using standard soft lithography methods. The co-axial grooved slit
channel was constructed by aligning and bonding two grooved PDMS channels by
oxygen plasma treatment. However, this manuscript fabricated the fibers with grooves
by adjust the solution concentration and flow rates. Grooved structure was analyzed at
three dimensional point including the groove width and depth, and grooves on the fiber
surface to form three dimensional structure. But, after I read the comments carefully
and considered the question put forward by the reviewer again and again, I agreed with
the reviewer and thought the fibers being not characterized as 3D materials. Thus, I
have corrected it in the manuscript.
Q1. The dimension of the microfluidic channels should be measured, which influences
the size of alginate fibers and its grooves. Also, the design of spinneret as shown in
Figure 1 (c), especially how CaCl2 and alginate meet, should be stated clearly. This
would be one of the possible reasons for grooves formation.
The diameters of core and sheath channels was 340 µm and 490 µm, respectively.
As shown in Figure 1(c), alginate solution and CaCl2 solution was orderly pumped into
syringe, PTFE tubes and microfluidic channels, then both solutions in the end of micro-
channels would meet to form the fibers. That was the result of chelation between the
carboxyl group of alginate molecular chain and the calcium ion of CaCl2 solution to
make alginate form the “egg-box” structure. The buckled chain of guluronic acid units
acting as a two-dimensional analogue of corrugated egg-box with interstices in the
calcium ions packed and coordinated to form fiber.
Q2. The authors thought reasons for grooves are the shrinkage of alginate fiber after
solvent evaporation and the double diffusion between CaCl2 and alginate solution. But
there is no evidence or experiments to prove it, which is strongly needed.
Both the roles of shrink and double diffusion led to the formation of grooves.
When alginate solution contacted with CaCl2 solution, Ca2+ ion and water molecular of
CaCl2 solution diffused into the alginate solution whereas the Na+ ion of alginate
solution diffused into CaCl2 solution. This double diffusion resulted in the ion-exchange
between Na+ of alginate and Ca2+ of CaCl2 solution to form alginate fiber. However,
the diffusion rates of ions were different and the solvent evaporated, which caused the
shrink of fibrous cortex. Hence, the surface of fiber generated wrinkle and then V-
shaped or concaved groove was obtained, as exhibited in the image of SEM. That could
be proved by the analysis of Ca and Na element content of grooves with EDS, as
displayed in Figure S1. It could be calculated that the ratio of Ca and Na element content
of alginate fiber was 76.38% and 16.13% respectively, indicating the double diffusion
between CaCl2 and alginate, and the bigger diffusion rate of Ca than that of Na.
Figure S1 EDS image of alginate fiber with grooves
Q3. In discussion 3.3, the stated working conditions were fuzzy and confusing in each
case, which makes conclusion unconvincing. In Figure 4, what were the core and sheath
flow rates when the concentration of alginate varied? In Figure 5, what was the
concentration of alginate and CaCl2, and which flow rate was varied as the value shown
on images?
In Figure 4, the core and sheath flow rates was 1.5 mL/min and 3 mL/min
respectively, when the concentration of alginate varied. In Figure 5, the concentration
of alginate and CaCl2 was 2% and 3% respectively, both core and sheath flow rates
were varied as the value shown on images.
Q4. There are problems in figures. There is no discussion about Figure 10 and what
does the y axis mean in Figure 10? In Figure 11, all three graphs should have the same
axis range that can clearly show the difference. Distinct figure explanation should be
applied in Figure 12.
The y axis meant the distribution of fibers diameters. The diameter distribution of
fibers fabricated by the concentration of 1%, 1.5% and 2% alginate were exhibited in
Figure 10 by the Image Pro Plus software. It could be found that the diameter of 1%
alginate fiber was chiefly between 23 µm and 26 µm, whereas that of 1.5% alginate
fiber being mainly around 27 µm. For 2% alginate fiber, the diameter was widespread,
ranging from 29 µm to 32 µm. It could be concluded that the diameter distribution of
fibers was proportional to the alginate concentration. Overall, the fibrous diameter
exhibited an increasing tendency with increasing the alginate polymer solution.
Figure 10. Diameter distribution of fibers spun at (a) 1%, (b) 1.5% and (c) 2%
alginate solutions
Figure 11 was marked as Figure 14. Three AFM images displayed different axis
range in Figure 14, because the probe used to scan the specimen at a set range to ensure
the probe work well. Various width and depth of grooves should be with a mixed
scanning range, resulting in the different axis range in the AFM graphs. If all the
specimen were scanned at the same axis range, the probe would be broke off when it
scanned various width and depth of grooves. Though, the axis range were different in
Figure 14, AFM was to measure the depth and width of grooves. I promise that I will
try my best to keep the same axis range as possible in the future work, which is more
beneficial to analyze and compare the datum.
Figure 12 was marked as Figure 15. The comments “Distinct figure explanation
should be applied in Figure 12” put forward by the reviewer has been added and
highlighted in the manuscript, as following: As exhibited in Figure 15, the W1% and
W2% was corresponding to 1.5% and 1% alginate solution respectively. The higher
concentration of alginate solution improved the rate of ion-exchange, promoting the
double diffusion. That was more beneficial to form the groove on fibers, as shown the
bigger grooves of 1.5% alginate solution than that of 1% in Figure 15.
Q5. In authors’ design, ethanol was used as solvent for the sheath flow, 3% (w/v) CaCl2,
to induce the gelation of alginate. Therefore there is ethanol residua in the generated
alginate fiber. But ethanol should be avoided in applications for cell culture like wound
dressing or tissue scaffold because of cytotoxicity. There may be problem in its possible
biomedical applications.
Ethanol should be avoided in application for cell culture like wound dressings or
tissue scaffold because of cytotoxicity. This question remind me that the nontoxicity is
significant for biomaterials and I will try my best to avoid choosing the cytotoxicity
solution. Although, ethanol used as solvent for the fabrication of alginate fiber and it
was all gone after a few days, which was proved as the research as previously done
(RSC Advs, 2017, 7(62): 39349-39358).

Dear Reviewer 3,
Thanks for your valuable advice, which is beneficial to my research. After read
the comments you put forward again and again, I have tried my best to add some
experiments and did some improvement as follow. The cross-section of fiber varied
with flow rates and concentrations have been added and highlighted in the manuscript,
and sub micro or nanometers of SEM images of grooves have been carried out again
and corrected in the manuscript. I promise that I will try to work hard and improve the
research level.
Thanks again, and I hope that I can learn much more knowledge from you.
If you have any question about this paper, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
Best regards,
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors represent a way to fabricate alginate hydrogel fiber based on concentration
and flow rate. However, the data was not represented and poorly organized. The author
should largely improve the format.
1. The author mentioned the viscosity dependent fabrication of microfiber. From Figure
5a, it looks like these parameters affect the cross-section morphology of fibers. Can the
author show a cross-section projection image, how it was being affected by
concentrations and flow rates.
The morphology structure of alginate fiber clearly demonstrated that polymer
concentration and flow rates not only affected the fibrous diameter, but also acted as
the key parameter to the processing. Hence, the cross-section morphology of fibers
fabricated by various concentration of alginate solution and flow rates were investigated.
As shown in Figure 7 and 8, the cross-section of fibers was circular with a sunken
segment and the grooves could be observed, which was affected by the alginate
concentration and flow rates. The dimension of grooves increased with an increasing in
the alginate solution and flow rates under a certain condition, and then exhibited a
decreased tendency. The bigger alginate concentration and flow rates improved the rate
of double diffusion, resulting in the clear grooves. However, fibers formed quickly with
the concentration and flow rates being high, impeding the double diffusion. That was
not beneficial to the formation of grooves, corresponding to the grooves change
displayed in the cross-section images of Figure 7 and 8.

Figure 8. Cross-section images of fibers fabricated at diverse flow rates
2. In figure 6 caption, the author mentioned the “curvature of fiber diameter”, but in the
figure, it is only the diameter. I just wonder what will be the curvature. And does the
curvature on the microfiber is uniform?
I’m so sorry that the discussion in figure 6 caption mislead you. I just study the
effect of flow rates on the fibers diameters and the curves of fiber dimeter were
displayed in figure 6. The curves of fiber diameter was not the curvature of fiber
diameter, and the curvature of fiber diameter was not the research point for this work.
But I am going to investigate the curvature of various fiber diameter in next research.
Anyway, I’m appreciate this question you proposed, which must be helpful for my
research in future.
3. What does Figure 7 provide? it looks like it just saying “the alginate fiber is alginate“
4. The same story with XRD. What does it provide?
Figure 7 and 8 was marked as Figure 9 and 10, respectively. FTIR spectra of
alginate polymer and fibers fabricated with diverse concentration of alginate solution
in Figure 9 (a) and (b). Figure 9 (a) proved that the alginate polymer and fiber exhibited
the similar absorption bands, and there were a slight variation of some peaks intensity
because of the egg-box structure of alginate fibers. But, there were no additional new
peaks as displayed in Figure 9 (a), indicating the unchanged molecular chain structure.
Figure 9 (b) illustrated the alginate solution concentration had little influence on the
chemical groups of fibers, resulting in the similar FTIR spectra of all fibers. Thus, few
noticeable shifts of absorption bands were observed in Figure 9, implying the alginate
solution concentration impacting on the groove structure whereas no generation of new
groups or chemical reaction.
The section in X-ray diffraction were investigated the crystal structure of alginate
fibers and polymer, and the degree of crystallinity were exhibited in Figure 10 (a) and
(b). Figure 10 (a) illustrated the alginate polymer and fibers displayed the same
2<U+03B8>=23.60 in the spectra, indicating the same phase composition agreed with the analysis
of FTIR spectra. But the crystallinity of fiber was higher than that of polymer, which
was the tanglesome roll structure of polymer turned to the straight chain structure in the
forming process of fibers. The crystallinity of fibers fabricated by 1%, 1.5% and 2%
alginate concentration demonstrated a similar behavior in Figure 10 (b), verifying the
little influence of concentration on the crystal behavior. Hence, the analysis of XRD
was further validated that there was no generation of new chemical groups during the
formation of alginate fibers, compared with the polymer. Furthermore, it was also
demonstrated that the alginate concentration impacted on the grooves dimension.
5. The authors claimed that they have a groove structure on fiber from Figure 9. But
their scale is even in tens of micron. We can not see any micron or submicron structure.
SEM can easily go to submicron and nanometers, please do a better image of fibers.
After read the comments carefully, the suggestion put forward by reviewer was
absolutely correct and I agree with more. Hence, the groove structure on fibers fabricate
by 1%, 1.5% and 2% alginate concentration was scanned again by SEM, as shown in
Figure 11. To observe the clearer groove structure, the scale was set as displayed in the
figure.
Figure 11. SEM image of groove with diverse width and depth on the fiber spun at (a)
1%, (b) 1.5% and (c) 2% alginate solutions
6. Figure 10 has a similar information to Figure 6.
Figure 10 was marked as Figure 12. Both Figure 6 and 12 investigated the fibers
diameter. The variation tendency of fiber diameters with flow rates were displayed in
Figure 6, and the distribution of fiber diameters were exhibited in Figure 12. The
discussion in Figure 6 was aimed to illustrate the influence of core and sheath flow rate
on fibers diameters and provided the change tendency of fiber diameter. But, the
discussion in Figure 12 was to explore the effect of alginate concentration on fiber
diameters and the diameters distribution of fiber fabricated with 1%, 1.5% and 2%
alginate solution were exhibited. The fiber diameters were studied in both figures,
whereas the different research point and objective in both figures.
7. Does AFM image on Figure 11 only show one groove on the fiber? But that scale is
too large for a single groove. If it is the fiber? It is too small for a single fiber shown in
Figure 10.
AFM image on Figure 11 was marked as Figure 14. I’m so sorry that the unit of grooves
depth and width in the discussion of AFM analysis from Figure 14 made a mistake, and
I have corrected as “The microgroove depths of 1% and 1.5% alginate fiber was
278.37±2.23 nm and 683.69±3.18 nm respectively, whilst that of 2% alginate fiber
being 727.52±3.52 nm. Furthermore, the widths of groove for 1%, 1.5% and 2%
samples was 251.33±1.67 nm, 419.67±2.82 nm and 730.67±3.12 nm, respectively.”
AFM image on Figure 14 exhibited one groove on the fibers, and the scan scale was
between 4 µm and 10 µm, which was determined by the width and depth of grooves.
And the diameter distribution of fibers was majorly between 20 µm and 32 µm.
