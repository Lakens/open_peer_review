General comments
The purpose of the present study was to describe biomechanical differences between well-trained
young and adult sprinters during the first step of a sprint run. Furthermore, the authors tried to
link acceleration performance aspects with muscle tendon unit (MTU) length and velocity
parameters.
While the overall presentation of the study motivation and results is good, I have some major
concerns regarding the calculations performed during the study. Furthermore, in my opinion the
speculations which the authors derive from their MTU results are too far reaching and not
supported by the data the authors present. In particular, the speculations regarding energy
storage and return made based on entire MTU behavior are clearly lacking support.
In my opinion the presentation of the MTU lengths and rates of length change in absolute values
(mm) is also critical since there is a clear difference in height between the two groups of athletes
of roughly 6 cm (adult athletes are taller). Therefore, the differences with respect to MTU length
changes might at least in part be related to differences in height. Nonetheless the authors did not
normalize their MTU lengths or tried to include body height as a covariate in their statistical
analysis.
Based on the results presented, the overall quality of either the center of mass calculations
performed or the force plate measurements needs to be challenged based on the results presented
in table Tables I and II. This is because the mass normalized horizontal GRF impulse should equal
the Change in horizontal COM velocity. Furthermore, horizontal GRF impulse can be calculated
by Contact Time multiplied with mean horizontal GRF. Taking the values from table I and II for
the young athletes group I calculate 0.199 s (contact time) x 5.43 N/kg (mean horizontal GRF) =
1.08 m/s. For the adult group: 0.191 s x 4.21 N/kg = 0.80 m/s. The values described for the
change in horizontal COM velocity in Table I are 1.17 m/s and 1.25 m/s, respectively. This means
that there is an 8% and 36% difference between the two values which based on Newton’s laws
should be identical. Acknowledging the simplifications always involved in any model, the 8%
difference for the young group might be considered a tolerable difference. Still, the 35%
difference in the adult group is indicative for a problem involved in the calculations or force
measurements.
Based on the above I feel that the quality of the manuscript is not meeting the standards of Royal
Society Open Science.

GENERAL COMMENTS:
This study examines the differences in Muscle-tendon unit length changes between young
and adult sprinters in first stance phase of sprint running. The paper is generally well designed
and data are generally well analysed. The work has relevance in sports biomechanics of sprinting
but the rationale/justification for the study could be more explicitly stated. There are various
places where the clarity of expression and conformity with journal guidelines could be improved
and these are described in the specific comments below. In general these focus mainly on minor
textual issues

Appendix A
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Your manuscript has been reviewed by two experts. While reviewer 2 raises only minor points for
evision, reviewer 1 raises more serious concerns about the quality of the data, consistency of variables
with respect to physical absolutes, and normalization of the data to account for variations related to
ubject body size.
Considering the concerns raised by reviewer 1, I cannot recommend the paper for publication in RSOS
However, I would be willing to consider a resubmission that it substantially revised to fully address the
ssues raised concerning data quality and analysis.
A: We thank the editor for the time and effort put into the reviewing process of the manuscript
and for allowing us to resubmit the revised version. We have addressed most of the issues
raised by reviewer 1 and reviewer 2. With regards to the comments by reviewer 1, we have
double-checked the analyses and no mistakes were made. However, we agree with the
reviewer that there was an inconsistency with regards to the output values when comparing
the two methods mentioned by the reviewer. This however, is not due to any mistakes made
in the analysis or due to the collection of the data but solely due to the assumptions made in
the musculoskeletal model (one example is the modelling of the trunk and head as one rigid
segment). However, we agree that this may lead to confusion with the reader and as such, have
decided to calculate the changes in the centre-of-mass velocity based on the ground-reaction
force method (impulse) and not by using the musculoskeletal modelling workflow. This
however changed the outcome of the statistical comparison with regards to this parameter
and we have therefore made some changes to the interpretation of this outcome, mainly in
the discussion section. As such, we are thankful to the reviewer for pointing out this
inconsistency and we hope that the interpretation of the results is now more straightforward.
However, we believe that some of the other remarks from reviewer 1 did not require changes
in the manuscript but rather explanation to the reviewer, as the concern is raised that we did
not normalise our muscle-tendon unit lengths. However, we did do this, and it was stated in
the methods section of the original manuscript as well as in the figures and figure captions.
We also do not fully agree that we have gone too far in our speculations with regards to elastic
energy storage as we believe we provide sufficient argumentation and citations. Yet, we have
removed some of the sections that could be seen as the most speculative.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:

Comments to the Author(s)
General comments
The purpose of the present study was to describe biomechanical differences between well-trained
young and adult sprinters during the first step of a sprint run. Furthermore, the authors tried to link
acceleration performance aspects with muscle tendon unit (MTU) length and velocity parameters.
While the overall presentation of the study motivation and results is good, I have some major concerns
egarding the calculations performed during the study. Furthermore, in my opinion the speculations
which the authors derive from their MTU results are too far reaching and not supported by the data
he authors present. In particular, the speculations regarding energy storage and return made based
on entire MTU behavior are clearly lacking support.
A: We agree that some sections were too speculative and as such have removed a few
sentences. However, we believe that in the remaining sections, we provide sufficient
argumentation and citations to previous work and point out several times that some parts are
speculative and not supported by our data. We believe therefore that it should be clear to the
reader that these sections are to stimulate future research rather than to claim them as solid
truth.
n my opinion the presentation of the MTU lengths and rates of length change in absolute values (mm)
s also critical since there is a clear difference in height between the two groups of athletes of roughly 6
cm (adult athletes are taller). Therefore, the differences with respect to MTU length changes might at
east in part be related to differences in height. Nonetheless the authors did not normalize their MTU
engths or tried to include body height as a covariate in their statistical analysis.
A: We agree with the reviewer that differences in body length should be taken into account
when looking at MTU lengths. However, this was done in the original manuscript as stated in
the methods section on line 141-144 “Reference MTU lengths were calculated with each scaled
model placed in anatomical position (i.e. all angles equal 0°). Then, for each participant, these
reference MTU lengths were subtracted from the MTU lengths of the first stance phase.” and
this was also presented in this manner in the figures. We believe that this method is valid as
we were interested in differences in relative length changes and by subtracting the baseline
MTU lengths (which are scaled as mentioned) we account for differences in body length. We
have added “The lengths of the MTUs were scaled in the scaling step of this workflow [13].” to
avoid any confusion to the reader. Normalisation by dividing by resting MTU length or body
height would be less relevant as the length changes that we sought to compare would only be
influenced by joint angles and moment arms. The moment arms (which should be impacted
the most by body height) are also scaled for each subject.
Based on the results presented, the overall quality of either the center of mass calculations performed
or the force plate measurements needs to be challenged based on the results presented in table Tables
and II. This is because the mass normalized horizontal GRF impulse should equal the Change in
horizontal COM velocity. Furthermore, horizontal GRF impulse can be calculated by Contact Time
multiplied with mean horizontal GRF. Taking the values from table I and II for the young athletes group
calculate 0.199 s (contact time) x 5.43 N/kg (mean horizontal GRF) = 1.08 m/s. For the adult group:
0.191 s x 4.21 N/kg = 0.80 m/s. The values described for the change in horizontal COM velocity in Table
are 1.17 m/s and 1.25 m/s, respectively. This means that there is an 8% and 36% difference between
he two values which based on Newton’s laws should be identical. Acknowledging the simplifications
always involved in any model, the 8% difference for the young group might be considered a tolerable
difference. Still, the 35% difference in the adult group is indicative for a problem involved in the
calculations or force measurements.
A: we agree with the reviewer that there was an inconsistency with regards to the output values
when comparing the two methods mentioned by the reviewer. This is not due to any mistakes
made in the analysis or due to the collection of the data but solely due to the assumptions
made in the musculoskeletal model (one example is the modelling of the trunk and head as

this parameter and we have therefore made some changes to the interpretation of this
outcome, mainly in the discussion section. As such, we are thankful to the reviewer for pointing
out this inconsistency and we hope that the interpretation of the results in now more
straightforward.
Based on the above I feel that the quality of the manuscript is not meeting the standards of Royal Society
Open Science.

Comments to the Author(s)
GENERAL COMMENTS:
This study examines the differences in Muscle-tendon unit length changes between young
and adult sprinters in first stance phase of sprint running. The paper is generally well designed and data
are generally well analysed. The work has relevance in sports biomechanics of sprinting but the
ationale/justification for the study could be more explicitly stated. There are various places where
he clarity of expression and conformity with journal guidelines could be improved and these are
described in the specific comments below. In general these focus mainly on minor textual issues
A: We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and have made most suggested changes.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:
P2 ln 9: Abbreviation RF used but not previously defined
A: This has been changed in the manuscript.
P 2 ln 12:....stance phase and... (rather than stance phase or)
A: This has been changed in the manuscript.
P2 ln14: While or although rather than even though
A: This has been changed in the manuscript.
p2 ln16 : MTUs provide (not further provide)
A: This has been changed in the manuscript.
P2 ln 26: Perhaps you should state accelerate at maximum effort?
A: This has been added to the manuscript.
P3 ln 30 perhaps therefore rather than "as such"
A: This has been changed in the manuscript.
P3 ln 31 perhaps omit this first instance
A: This has been changed in the manuscript.
p3 ln 38 perhaps omit "in a recent study however"
A: We thank the reviewer for this suggestions, however, we would like to emphasize that only
recently the first study looked at young versus adult sprinters in this context. As such we have
kept the “in a recent study” in this sentence. We do agree that this is not necessarily a
contradicting statement to the previous sentence and have therefore removed the “however”.
P3 ln 44 Altered relative contributions.... Relative to what?
A: We agree that this was confusing and have added “compared to the adult athletes”.
P3 56 Impact performance ... Need to be more specific .. impact what aspect of performance?
A: We have changed this to “the ability to accelerate the body COM”.
n 67-70: The lack of studies is not sufficient to justify the work.. I think you need to establish a clear
ationale for the study at this point. I fully appreciate the value and need for this work but you need to
make this clear.
A: We have removed the “lack of studies” part and emphasize the fact that it remains unknown
whether the ‘previously highlighted performance parameters’ differ between young and adult
athletes. We believe that the rationale for why this is important to know comes forth from the
previous paragraphs, justifying the study.
n 84 and throughout. The number unit convention is number space unit (10 m not 100m) please check
and correct this throughout.
A: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and we have changed this throughout the
manuscript.
n 92 : how long prior...?
A: “three to six weeks” has been added to the manuscript.
n97 please indicate min and max recovery time
A: “six minutes recovery time” has been added to the manuscript.
n 104: Should be 1000 Hz not 1000HZ
A: This has been changed throughout the manuscript.
n 110 : perhaps include some more specific detail as this is very important in your study.
A: We are uncertain to what the reviewer is making a reference to here and have therefore not
made any changes in this section at the moment. We believe that we elaborate on the most
important analyses steps here and only make reference to previous studies for readers that are
interested in reading more studies regarding these parameters. A single sentence has been
added specifically referring to figure 1, which shows the RF values over a stance phase. We
hope that this will help in understanding of this section.
n 113: do you mean the horizontal component of ground reaction force?
A: “[horizontal] component of the [GRF]” has been added to the manuscript.
n omit "in order"
A: This has been changed in the manuscript.
n 130 insert comma after this method,
A: This has been changed in the manuscript.
n 138: It is good to see that these slops have been separated rather than pooled, however this implies
hat the joint stiffness did not behave as a ideal spring (energy was dissipated...) therefore can we
consider joint stiffness to be a valid measure under these conditions (R^2 <0.7)?
A: We agree that the joints during human movement never actually behave as ideal springs.
As such, the stiffness that we calculate is not an exact stiffness as seen in classical mechanics.
However, this term has been used previously and is a generally well-accepted term in the field
of human movement biomechanics. Furthermore, it has been used in this sense in a couple of
previous studies that are cited in our manuscript and we therefore prefer using this term as it
allows for easy comparison by the reader with other studies.
n 162 -1< = < 1 is a confusing expression
A: This has been changed to “values lower than -1 or greater than 1”.
n 173 and throughout. You had no consideration of effect sizes. Perhaps this could have enhanced the
nterpretation of results especially when you have small groups and some effects looked (my estimate)
medium to large when p values were marginally greater than 0.05. Interpretation of the magnitude of
he effects could enhance your analysis rather than relying solely on p values.
A: We appreciate the suggestion of the reviewer. However, we believe that our groups are
arge enough to have sufficient power in order to find statistically relevant differences. Our main
purpose was to compare the young and adult sprinters and not to assess the importance of these
parameters (as this was done for some in previous studies cited in the manuscript). We have
calculated all the effect sizes as asked by the reviewer, but the results only follow the p-value for
he comparisons (significant differences all have high effect sizes, statistical trends have moderate
o low effect sizes and non-significant comparisons all have low effect sizes). As such, we were
eluctant to add effect sizes as we are not fully convinced this would make the manuscript
tronger and we believe that there are already a high number of results in this manuscript. We
hope the reviewer will support this reasoning. I have added a Matlab file with the effect size
esults for the reviewer.
n 176: is this reasonable given the small data set? What about consideration of effect sizes?
A: Please see previous answer.
n 211: spelling US or UK consistency
A: We thank the reviewer for noticing. We have gone through the manuscript and hope to
have found all inconsistencies and have made changes accordingly.
n 225 "not only..." The sentence structure is awkward here.
A: These sentences have been changed in the manuscript to make the reading easier.
