This looks to be a good piece of research, although note that the QSAR and bioassay work are
beyond my expertise, hence my comments are limited to the synthetic chemistry. With minor
revision, I am happy that the work be published, but it is important that the QSAR aspects are
also appraised by another reviewer before final acceptance.
For designed compounds 'a' and 'b', full experimental procedures should be provided so that a
skilled synthetic chemist could repeat their work and make the same compounds. This would
also help to clarify in what form the compounds were made (e.g. the data suggest as a bis-
potassium salt, but in Fig 6 no counterions are shown- it would be better if their ambiguity was
cleared up). The authors should also revise the 1H NMR data for compound 'a'- for example, the
signal at 7.28 is quoted as a 3H dt with J = 25.1, 7.3, which cannot be correct. Overlapping signals
may well give the appearance of this, but it is not correct to report it in this way. I am also
sceptical of the way the data are reported for the peaks at 4.10 and 2.61, but without the raw
spectral data I am unable to comment further. I suggest the authors revise their NMR data,
perhaps in consulatation with an experienced synthetic organic chemist.

This work is well organized and represents a helpful contribution to the field of cinnamaldehyde
applications. I recommend accepting this paper for publication, after the suggested revisions are
implemented.

1. All the abbreviation should be defined when it appears the first time, for example, on
Page 1, line 29. “Aspergillus niger and Penicillium citrinum” could be revised as “Aspergillus
niger (A. niger) and Penicillium citrinum (P. niger)”.
2. On Page 1, the first paragraph in “Introduction” (line 35-37) needs to be deleted.
3. The synthesis route of Schiff base compounds could be added for better understanding
of these compounds.
4. Page 2, line 38, 40. “dT, dC” could be revised as “dT, dC”.
5. Page 2, line 46, 56. The number of compounds used for QSAR calculations is different
from the number of compounds showed in Table 1 and 2. The number of compounds needs to be
revised.
6. Page 3, line 17 to 20. The sentence of “These four descriptors parameters and statistical
data corresponding to the optimal QSAR models were listed in Table 3, and the definition and
analysis for each descriptor parameter were presented in Results and Discussion subsection.” is
repeated twice, one of them needs to be deleted.
7. Page 3, line 52 to 53. “As shown in Table 3, RNCG negatively contributed to the AR
against P. citrinum.” should be revised as “As shown in Table 3, RNCG negatively contributed to
the AR against A.niger.”
8. On page 4, the structure names need to be given for new designed compounds, and the
abbreviation of design compounds should be consistent in manuscript.
9. On page 26, the structure name showed in Figure 6 should take into account the
geometric configuration.

Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you very much for your comments concerning our manuscript entitled "Design of
cinnamaldehyde amino acids Schiff base compounds based on the quantitative structure activity
relationship". The comments are all valued and very helpful for revising and improving our paper.
We have studied the comments carefully and tried our best to revise the manuscript according to
the comments. Revised text is marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and
the responses to the reviewers’ comments are as follows:
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
This looks to be a good piece of research, although note that the QSAR and bioassay work are beyond
my expertise, hence my comments are limited to the synthetic chemistry. With minor revision, I am
happy that the work be published, but it is important that the QSAR aspects are also appraised by
another reviewer before final acceptance.
For designed compounds 'a' and 'b', full experimental procedures should be provided so that a skilled
synthetic chemist could repeat their work and make the same compounds. This would also help to
clarify in what form the compounds were made (e.g. the data suggest as a bis-potassium salt, but in Fig
6 no counterions are shown- it would be better if their ambiguity was cleared up). The authors should
also revise the 1H NMR data for compound 'a'- for example, the signal at 7.28 is quoted as a 3H dt with
J = 25.1, 7.3, which cannot be correct. Overlapping signals may well give the appearance of this, but it
is not correct to report it in this way. I am also sceptical of the way the data are reported for the peaks
at 4.10 and 2.61, but without the raw spectral data I am unable to comment further. I suggest the
authors revise their NMR data, perhaps in consulatation with an experienced synthetic organic
chemist.
Response:
(1)Thanks for your good suggestion. We had re-drawn the Figure 6, and this figure was marked as
Fig.7 in resubmitted manuscript.
(2)A full experimental procedure about synthesis of new compounds was provided in Supplementary
Material. Please check. The synthesis methods as follows:
Equal malar ratio cinnamaldehyde and aspartic acid (0.0067mol) were added into 30 mL methanol.
Then, 0.0134mol potassium hydroxide was added in to 20 mL methanol to prepare the potassium
hydroxide methanol solution. Under stirring, potassium hydroxide methanol solution added into
cinnamaldehyde aspartic acid mixture drop by drop until aspartic acid completely dissolved. After that,
keep stirring the mixture for 5 hours at room temperature. Finally, the solvent was removed by rotary
evaporation at 35 °C. The target compounds will be gained by added 15 mL diethyl ether. Then, the
precipitate was washed three times and vacuum dried for 6 hours.
(3) The NMR date of new designed compounds was revised in resubmitted manuscript, and the
raw spectral data given in Supplementary Material. Please check the 4th page.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.

1. All the abbreviation should be defined when it appears the first time, for example, on Page 1, line 29.
“Aspergillus niger and Penicillium citrinum” could be revised as “Aspergillus niger (A. niger) and
Penicillium citrinum (P. citrinum)”.
Response: Accepted, we have revised all the abbreviation.
2. On Page 1, the first paragraph in “Introduction” (line 35-37) needs to be deleted.
Response: we are very sorry for our negligence, the first paragraph in “Introduction” was deleted.
Please Check.
3. The synthesis route of Schiff base compounds could be added for better understanding of these
compounds.
Response: Thanks for your good suggestion, we had added the synthesis route of cinnamaldehyde
Schiff base compounds and described as Figure 1.
4. Page 2, line 38, 40. “dT, dC” could be revised as “dT, dC”.
Response: Accepted, we had revised “dT, dC”.
5. Page 2, line 46, 56. The number of compounds used for QSAR calculations is different from the
number of compounds showed in Table 1 and 2. The number of compounds needs to be revised.
Response: Accepted, we had corrected the number of compounds.
6. Page 3, line 17 to 20. The sentence of “These four descriptors parameters and statistical data
corresponding to the optimal QSAR models were listed in Table 3, and the definition and analysis for
each descriptor parameter were presented in Results and Discussion subsection.” is repeated twice, one
of them needs to be deleted.
Response: Accepted, we had deleted that sentence.
7. Page 3, line 52 to 53. “As shown in Table 3, RNCG negatively contributed to the AR against P.
citrinum.” should be revised as “As shown in Table 3, RNCG negatively contributed to the AR against
A.niger.”
Response: Accepted, we had corrected it.
8. On page 4, the structure names need to be given for new designed compounds, and the abbreviation
of design compounds should be consistent in manuscript.
Response: Accepted, the designed compounds marked as “Da” and “Db”. The structure names of two
designed compounds were given on 4th page.
9. On page 26, the structure name showed in Figure 6 should take into account the geometric
configuration.
Response: Accepted, the structure names of designed compounds showed in Figure 6 were replaced,
and new figure was marked as Fig. 7.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
