Title: Dust evolution, a global view: II. Top-down branching, nano-particle fragmentation and the
mystery of the diffuse interstellar band carriers.
Author: Anthony Jones
Reviewer: Adolf N. Witt, University of Toledo
Summary
This paper represents the first in-depth conceptual study of the top-down fragmentation process
of interstellar nano-particles as a source of the carrier molecules responsible for the diffuse
interstellar bands (DIB). ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE is an ideal platform for this type of
discussion, and I am strongly in favor of seeing this paper published. However, there are a few
issues that need to be addressed in more detail. I will enumerate these issues below.
I propose that the author expand an otherwise excellent manuscript by discussing these issues
along the lines suggested below.
Major Issues
There are three major issues that should be addressed in a more consistent fashion. These are:
a) size of the DIB carriers
b) abundance of DIB carriers
c) stability or lifetime of DIB carriers
a. It is being suggested at several points in the manuscript that only particles with ~50 atoms or
more are likely to survive in the ISM dominated by a radiation field with photons of E < 13.6 eV.
This appears indeed to be the case with PAH particles in the reflection nebula NGC 7023 (Croiset
et al, arXiv:1603.02577), although the density of the radiation field in this object is several 10^2
times higher than that found in the diffuse ISM. An analysis of the energetics of extended red
emission (ERE) in the diffuse ISM by Duley (2009, ApJ, 705, 446) suggests that the particles
responsible for this ubiquitous emission process are most likely in the range 20 < N < 28, where N
is the number of carbon atoms per particle. Most recently, work by Huang & Oka (2016,
arXiv:1603.03119) concludes that the carrier of the strong DIB5797.1 most likely consists of a
molecule with between 5 and 7 carbon atoms.
This suggests to me that size is only one factor that determines the survival of a small particle in
the presence of energetic UV photons. A useful reference in this regard is the paper by Leger et al.
(1989, A&A, 213, 351) entitled “Photo-thermo-dissociation. I. A general mechanism for destroying
molecules”.
The absorption of a far-UV photon by a highly isolated molecule or molecular ion (N < 60) sets
up the possibility for several competing processes, some of which leading to decreased stability,
while others may preserve stability. Processes in the first category are second ionization of photo-
fragmentation (de-hydrogenation or ejection of C2 fragments), while processes of the second
category are cooling by emission of mid-IR photons generated in vibrational modes (slow) or
cooling by inverse internal conversion, resulting in the emission of one or more low energy
optical photons (fast). Whether or not a particle in the N < 60 domain survives or not may
therefore depend less on size but more on the balance between de-stabilizing vs. stabilizing
cooling processes. An interesting example
3
was discussed by Ito et al. (2014, PRL, 112, 183001), who contrasted the cooling dynamics of
photo-excited C6- and C6H- molecular ions. The fast radiative cooling via emission of optical
photons is dominant in systems with low-lying electronic states, which can be populated through
inverse internal conversion in highly excited isolated molecules or molecular ions (Nitzan &
Jortner 1979, JChemPhys, 71, 3524; Leger et al. 1988, PRL, 60, 921; Chandrasekaran et al. 2014,
JPhysChemLett, 5(23), 4078; Ebara et al. 2015, JPhys, Conf. Ser. 635, 032095).
b. While the author correctly points out (Sect. 2) that the number of structural variants among
particles with N ~ 30 produced by top-down fragmentation could easily reach several 10^6, it is
left unclear, how many of these variants could persist with significant abundances in the ISM. In
fact, the cosmic abundance of carbon relative to hydrogen in the ISM sets stringent constraints.
DIB carriers like the recently identified C60+ have estimated column densities ~ 2 x 10^13 cm^-2
in a line of sight with N(H) ~ 7 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Walker et al. 2015, ApJL, 812, L8). With
reasonable estimates for the amount of carbon not in the atom/ion or dust phase and thus
available for unaccounted-for molecular structures, on finds that only ~10^3 such structural
variants can be present with abundances high enough to produce observable DIBs. This is
approximately the same order of magnitude as the number of observed DIBs. One should,
therefore, focus on those structural variants that have the highest degree of stability under harsh
conditions. In this context, the work by R. O. Jones (1999, JChemPhys, 110, 5189) on the relative
stability of small carbon clusters, the paper by Yuan et al. (2012, J.Am.Chem.Soc., 134, 2970) on
“magic” carbon clusters, the study by J. M. L. Martin (1996, Chem.Phys.Lett. 255, 1) on C28,
possibly the smallest stable fullerene, and the publication by Kosimov et al. (2010, PhysRev B, 81,
195414) may be of interest.
c. Based on the considerations above, one is led to the conclusion that only a tiny fraction (<~10^-
3) of structural variants survives long enough to build up significant abundances in the ISM,
whereas the vast majority of structures are extremely short-lived and purely transient.
By contrast, the DIB carriers are more likely long-lived species. If they were not, the top-down
process would destroy carbonaceous dust on a very rapid time scale, which would then require
equally rapid reformation and injection of new carbonaceous dust into the ISM, which might be
contradicted by observational evidence on the rate of dust formation in galaxies.
Minor Issues
1. The idea of top-down production of large interstellar molecules through processing of
carbonaceous grains or grain mantles is not new and has been discussed for at least a decade.
Reference might be made to earlier works by Duley (2006, Faraday Discuss. 133, 415), Zhen et al.
(2014, ApJL, 797, L30), and Guzman et al. (2015, ApJL, 800, L33).
2. Sect. 6.(c)
The second sentence in this section is misleading. It suggests that the mid-IR emission bands
(often attributed to PAHs) are observed only in special regions of the ISM. In fact, the emission
bands are observed everywhere where there is interstellar dust and an abundance of UV photons,
with the sole exception of the interior of H II regions and supernova remnants, where the carriers
appear to be entirely destroyed.
In particular, the mid-IR bands are emitted throughout the diffuse ISM (see Onaka 2004, ASP
Conf. Ser. 309, 163). More importantly, the intensity of the mid-IR emission bands in the diffuse
ISM, when measured per unit column density and per unit UV exciting photons, is at least one
order of magnitude larger than the intensity of the same bands in reflection nebulae (RN) and
PDRs, where observations of the emission bands are most commonly conducted. This suggests
4
that a very large fraction of the carriers that are able to survive in the diffuse ISM with a standard
interstellar radiation field can no longer exist in RN and PDRs, where the radiation density is
typically a few 10^2 times higher.
3. Sect. 7.(a)
The statement “.... the dust emission, as measured by the 12 µm continuum.” may be misleading.
IRTS spectra of the diffuse ISM (see Onaka, referenced above) show that the emission in the 12 µm
band (either IRAS 12 µm or WISE W3) is composed mainly mid-IR band emission, not
continuum (note: the WISE W3 band, which forms the basis for the all-sky 12 µm map of
Meisner & Finkbeiner (2014, ApJ, 781, 5) extends roughly from 7 µm to 17 µm in wavelength
and includes major bands at 7.7 µm, 8.6 µm, 11.2 µm, and 12.7 µm).
Text-Editing Issues
1. The first sentence in the abstract has a slight problem. It could be changed to:

>>> I thank the referee for his kind words and, in particular, for the suggestions that have led to some
significant, and hopefully interesting, additions to the manuscript (see below).
All changes and additions have been highlighted in blue throughout.
Major Issues
There are three major issues that should be addressed in a more consistent fashion. These are:
a) size of the DIB carriers
b) abundance of DIB carriers
c) stability or lifetime of DIB carriers
>>> These critical issues raised by the referee have now been addressed in the new sections 6(e) and
6(f) with three accompanying new figures. The text has, as a result, also undergone other modifications
and additions in sections 6(b) and 6(c). I thanks the referee for pointing me towards some key works in
this area.
a. It is being suggested at several points in the manuscript that only particles with ~50 atoms or more
are likely to survive in the ISM dominated by a radiation field with photons of E < 13.6 eV. This appears
indeed to be the case with PAH particles in the reflection nebula NGC 7023 (Croiset et al,
arXiv:1603.02577), although the density of the radiation field in this object is several 10^2 times higher
than that found in the diffuse ISM. An analysis of the energetics of extended red emission (ERE) in the
diffuse ISM by Duley (2009, ApJ, 705, 446) suggests that the particles responsible for this ubiquitous
emission process are most likely in the range 20 < N < 28, where N is the number of carbon atoms per
particle. Most recently, work by Huang & Oka (2016, arXiv:1603.03119) concludes that the carrier of the
strong DIB5797.1 most likely consists of a molecule with between 5 and 7 carbon atoms.
This suggests to me that size is only one factor that determines the survival of a small particle in the
presence of energetic UV photons. A useful reference in this regard is the paper by Leger et al. (1989,
A&A, 213, 351) entitled “Photo-thermo-dissociation. I. A general mechanism for destroying molecules”.
The absorption of a far-UV photon by a highly isolated molecule or molecular ion (N < 60) sets up the
possibility for several competing processes, some of which leading to decreased stability, while others
may preserve stability. Processes in the first category are second ionization of photo-fragmentation (de-
hydrogenation or ejection of C2 fragments), while processes of the second category are cooling by
emission of mid-IR photons generated in vibrational modes (slow) or cooling by inverse internal
conversion, resulting in the emission of one or more low energy optical photons (fast). Whether or not a
particle in the N < 60 domain survives or not may therefore depend less on size but more on the
balance between de-stabilizing vs. stabilizing cooling processes. An interesting example
was discussed by Ito et al. (2014, PRL, 112, 183001), who contrasted the cooling dynamics of photo-
excited C6- and C6H- molecular ions. The fast radiative cooling via emission of optical photons is
dominant in systems with low-lying electronic states, which can be populated through inverse internal
conversion in highly excited isolated molecules or molecular ions (Nitzan & Jortner 1979, JChemPhys,
Ebara et al. 2015, JPhys, Conf. Ser. 635, 032095).

that discusses carrier stability has been added along with three new figures and the relevant
bibliography.
b. While the author correctly points out (Sect. 2) that the number of structural variants among particles
with N ~ 30 produced by top-down fragmentation could easily reach several 10^6, it is left unclear, how
many of these variants could persist with significant abundances in the ISM. In fact, the cosmic
abundance of carbon relative to hydrogen in the ISM sets stringent constraints. DIB carriers like the
recently identified C60+ have estimated column densities ~ 2 x 10^13 cm^-2 in a line of sight with
N(H) ~ 7 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Walker et al. 2015, ApJL, 812, L8). With reasonable estimates for the
amount of carbon not in the atom/ion or dust phase and thus available for unaccounted-for molecular
structures, on finds that only ~10^3 such structural variants can be present with abundances high
enough to produce observable DIBs. This is approximately the same order of magnitude as the number
of observed DIBs. One should, therefore, focus on those structural variants that have the highest degree
of stability under harsh conditions. In this context, the work by R. O. Jones (1999, JChemPhys, 110,
5189) on the relative stability of small carbon clusters, the paper by Yuan et al. (2012, J.Am.Chem.Soc.,
134, 2970) on “magic” carbon clusters, the study by J. M. L. Martin (1996, Chem.Phys.Lett. 255, 1) on
C28, possibly the smallest stable fullerene, and the publication by Kosimov et al. (2010, PhysRev B, 81,
195414) may be of interest.
>>> These issues are now discussed in more detail in sections 6(e) and 6(f). However, it has been
made clear in the revised version that, independent of stability, the number of structural isomers, for a
species with a given number of heavy atoms, is independent of its abundance. However, this is not the
same as the number of stable species, which must be considerably less.
Based on the idea that C_60^+ could be typical of the DIB carriers is has been possible to estimate that
a significant fraction of C (~20 ppm) must be locked up in the DIB carriers. I thank the referee for
raising these key issues.
c. Based on the considerations above, one is led to the conclusion that only a tiny fraction (<~10^-3) of
structural variants survives long enough to build up significant abundances in the ISM, whereas the vast
majority of structures are extremely short-lived and purely transient.
By contrast, the DIB carriers are more likely long-lived species. If they were not, the top-down process
would destroy carbonaceous dust on a very rapid time scale, which would then require equally rapid
reformation and injection of new carbonaceous dust into the ISM, which might be contradicted by
observational evidence on the rate of dust formation in galaxies.
>>> The issue of DIB carrier lifetime and associated issues are now discussed in the new section 6(f).
Minor Issues
1. The idea of top-down production of large interstellar molecules through processing of carbonaceous
grains or grain mantles is not new and has been discussed for at least a decade. Reference might be
made to earlier works by Duley (2006, Faraday Discuss. 133, 415), Zhen et al. (2014, ApJL, 797, L30),
and Guzman et al. (2015, ApJL, 800, L33).
>>> These references to earlier mentions of top-down formation have now been cited.
2. Sect. 6.(c)
The second sentence in this section is misleading. It suggests that the mid-IR emission bands (often
attributed to PAHs) are observed only in special regions of the ISM. In fact, the emission bands are
observed everywhere where there is interstellar dust and an abundance of UV photons, with the sole
exception of the interior of H II regions and supernova remnants, where the carriers appear to be
entirely destroyed.
In particular, the mid-IR bands are emitted throughout the diffuse ISM (see Onaka 2004, ASP Conf. Ser.
309, 163). More importantly, the intensity of the mid-IR emission bands in the diffuse ISM, when
measured per unit column density and per unit UV exciting photons, is at least one order of magnitude
larger than the intensity of the same bands in reflection nebulae (RN) and PDRs, where observations of
the emission bands are most commonly conducted. This suggests that a very large fraction of the
longer exist in RN and PDRs, where the radiation density is typically a few 10^2 times higher.
>>> In fact the IR emission bands are also absent in dense regions as well as HII regions and SNRs.
This has been clarified and simplified and the loss of IR emission band carriers in dense regions is now
also mentioned and referenced. The fact that the bands are under-abundant in PDRs could indeed be
due to their destruction but it could also be due to their not being liberated from the dust coming from
the denser regions adjacent to the PDRs. I think that the jury is still out on this point. I decided not to
go into the details here but have tried to clarify matters where necessary.
3. Sect. 7.(a)
The statement “.... the dust emission, as measured by the 12 µm continuum.” may be misleading. IRTS
spectra of the diffuse ISM (see Onaka, referenced above) show that the emission in the 12 µm band
(either IRAS 12 µm or WISE W3) is composed mainly mid-IR band emission, not continuum (note: the
WISE W3 band, which forms the basis for the all-sky 12 µm map of Meisner & Finkbeiner (2014, ApJ,
781, 5) extends roughly from 7µm to 17 µm in wavelength and includes major bands at 7.7 µm, 8.6 µm,
11.2 µm, and 12.7 µm).
>>> This has now been simplified to just state that there is a correlation with dust emission without
going into any of the details. In fact, the association with dust emission is probably rather trivial because
the DIBs, in part, correlate with extinction and dust emission is directly correlated with extinction.
