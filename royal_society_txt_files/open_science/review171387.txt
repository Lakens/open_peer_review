The present manuscript reported on two experimental studies examining the effects of exposure
to images of women at different ends of the weight spectrum. I have a number of concerns about
the manuscript in its current form including
Overall comments: Throughout the report, I would suggest some changes in terms of the
framing. For example, study 1 reports to use “healthy” women as compared to the women with
“high body dissatisfaction” recruited for study 2. The implication is that body dissatisfaction is
“unhealthy.” It is indeed an important concerns associated with increased risk for other physical
and psychological disorders, however “unhealthy” is an odd description.
Similarly, I would suggest considering providing more framing to the terms “normal weight,”
“overweight,” “normal,” “attractive,” and “fatter.”

Abstract:
- it was unclear to me from the description of study 1 how may conditions there were.
Introduction:
- Overall the introduction provides a good overview of the literature, however, there is a need to
be more specific in use of terminology, as well as clarifying the gap filled by the current study.
- For example, on page 4, line 64, the authors interpret the findings from the studies mentioned as
suggesting that “body size perceptions may transfer across identities”. What exactly is meant by
identities?
- Similarly, the relationship between body image and eating disorder needs to be clarified.
Relatedly, when the authors describe that a study decreased eating disorder symptoms for 2
weeks, are these behavioral symptoms or more body image related ones.
- How is the sentence at the bottom of page 4 regarding behavioral outcomes (food consumption)
related to this study? This needs further contextualization. The link between eating behavior and
body image should be clarified.
- Given that the current study focuses only on women, it would be good to have a little more
consideration of gender. For example, on page 3, line 55 the authors describe some research
among males- how does this fit in with the current study.
- In the introduction line 41, it is odd to say that treatments for eating disorders have had little
success in treating body image, as body image disturbance in the context of an eating disorder
may be different to body image in other contexts.
- The sentence page 5, line 88 is confusing to me
- Why chocolate? This needs more detail as chocolate is a particular food in the context of
disordered eating in that it is particularly craved, and also is often perceived as an unhealthy
food.
Methods:
- The authors should describe each of the measures in more detail including the scoring, an
example item, support for its psychometric properties from past studies, as well as the
psychometric properties in the current study.
- Did the authors do any piloting with the stimuli to see if the widened and narrowed bodies
were perceived by participants as realistic?
- Can the authors speak to the ethnic identity and body shapes (muscularity etc.) of the 10
women chosen to provide the stimuli for the study?
- Why was BMI restricted to 19-25 in study 1?
- Why was 35 chosen as a cutoff for the BDI scale in study 2?
Results:
- It would be helpful to number the hypotheses listed at the end of the introduction and then refer
back to them in this way in the results section.
- Unless I am missing a methodological reason for this not being possible, I would suggest
combining the participants from studies 1 and 2 so as to increase statistical power and observe
whether body dissatisfaction moderated the changes in body size perception and satisfaction.
Discussion:
- Again in the discussion section it would be good to clarify which of the findings are novel and
how they build upon previous work.
- My reading of the literature suggests that the finding that repeated exposure to underweight
models orients individuals to lower body weight norms is not a novel one.

Many thanks for addressing my comments, your changes and clarifications have improved the
manuscript. However, I still have several concerns that require attention.
8
-Lines 17-18: sentence beginning "Exposure to different..": This sentence lacks clarity, and could
be explained more simply (e.g. Exposure to bodies of different sizes etc). The use of "normal
weight" doesn't feel quite right, it may be clearer to use the word "normal" within speech marks.
-Lines 43-44: Only one study has been cited regarding prevalence, please consider a greater body
of research.
-Lines 44-46: Given that your research is conducted with adult women, please consider research
demonstrating a desire for thinness among this group too.
Lines 46-48: This is an odd and unfamiliar description of internalisation. Consider that coined by
Thompson et al., 1999 - which is commonly employed and understood within the wider body
image field.
Line 77: Given that this limitation in previous research forms part of the rationale for the current
study, please expand on the factors by which the models differed beyond their size. Also, I find
your argument somewhat contradictory of your final implications - given that you use "non-
model" women who have not been made to look glamorous as your experimental stimuli, yet
your study implications are for advertising - which includes professional glamorous models. So
can you infer these implications?
Lines 80-88: I wonder whether discussion of this study is better places in the discussion, in
conjunction with future research. I feel it is oddly placed here, as you are not including a sample
of women with disordered eating/an eating disorder. Alternatively, perhaps you could focus on
the group with baseline body dissatisfaction. Also, how does this study differ substantially from
the current study?
Lines 91-93: This statement is misleading, as each eating disorder has different characteristics
with regard to eating. Findings from the current study would not inform whether and if so,
which, eating disorder the individual may develop. Arguably, someone with body dissatisfaction
may eat more chocolate and eventually go on to develop bulimia or binge eating disorder, or
they may eat none and eventually go one to develop anorexia. So the amount of chocolate eaten
will not actually inform us of whether someone is more likely to develop an eating disorder.
Given that this is the case, and that the measure of chocolate consumption is the aspect of your
study which differentiates it from previous studies, I question the true useful novelty of your
study.
-Lines 412-413: Please consider why no differences where found in chocolate consumption.
Lines 476-479: It is too much of a leap to suggest such an intervention for groups with an eating
disorder. Surely the first step would be to conduct the current study among this group?

The authors have been very responsive to the feedback provided on their manuscript, which is
much improved. However, I have some additional suggestions before recommending the
manuscript for publication.
- I think that the additions that the authors have made to the beginning paragraph of the
manuscript are useful for situating the current study, however, I wonder if the implications are
more for the alteration of perception of desired body size rather than actual size? As the authors
highlight, it is the comparison with the thin-ideal that generally leads to body dissatisfaction
rather than very inaccurate body size perception.
- The study that is described lines 52-60 seems to be illustrating change in body size evaluation
(as being attractive etc.) rather than perception I think? This seems similar to the authors’
hypothesis regarding effects of the manipulation on body satisfaction. In contrast the study
described lines 62-70 does indeed look at body size perception. This seems closer to the
hypothesis regarding the size-perception of the bodies of others. Here too it would be good to be
very specific.
- Line 320, could the authors clarify what is meant by a mega-analysis?
- Line 468, I commend the authors for clarifying that data suggest that using average size women
in advertising does not compromise effectiveness. I suggest also highlighting here that these data
also supported that advertisements with average size women were protective of body image.

Appendix A
I thank the authors for giving me the opportunity to review their paper, which examines the
influence of viewing different-sized bodies on the perception of both one’s own and others’ body
size, and satisfaction with one’s own body size. This is an important area which warrants attention.
The methodological rigour employed by the authors is pleasing (e.g. blinding, randomisation,
sensitivity analyses), and the paper’s findings highlight the potential benefits of including greater
body shape diversity in advertising. Nonetheless, I feel there are a number of points to be addressed
before the paper can be accepted for publication.
Abstract
• The second sentence (lines 17-18) requires greater clarity. What is meant by “normal”?
• Please include follow-up time (i.e. 24 hours, line 23).
• The description of the methodology would benefit from greater clarity, e.g. what was the 15
minute task? The testing by chocolate consumption could also be included here.
Keywords
• “Body size” might be a helpful keyword to add.

Appendix B
Dear Alice Power,
Re: Manuscript RSOS-171387: Effects of exposure to bodies of different sizes on perception
of and satisfaction with own body size: two randomised studies.
Many thanks for giving us the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ comments on our
paper, which we address individually below.
Reviewer: 1
1. I thank the authors for giving me the opportunity to review their paper, which
examines the influence of viewing different-sized bodies on the perception of both
one’s own and others’ body size, and satisfaction with one’s own body size. This is an
important area which warrants attention. The methodological rigour employed by
the authors is pleasing (e.g. blinding, randomisation, sensitivity analyses), and the
paper’s findings highlight the potential benefits of including greater body shape
diversity in advertising. Nonetheless, I feel there are a number of points to be
addressed before the paper can be accepted for publication.
Authors’ Response: Thank you for this positive input. We address your specific points
individually below.
Abstract
1. The second sentence (lines 17-18) requires greater clarity. What is meant by
“normal”?
Authors’ Response: We have clarified this as follows: “Exposure to different-sized bodies has
been suggested to change body size perceived as normal weight in others.”
2. Please include follow-up time (i.e. 24 hours, line 23).
Authors’ Response: We have amended this as requested.
3. The description of the methodology would benefit from greater clarity, e.g. what
was the 15 minute task? The testing by chocolate consumption could also be
included here.
Authors’ Response: We have added that the task is a two-back task, and that the amount of
chocolate the participants consumed was also measured.
Keywords
1. “Body size” might be a helpful keyword to add.
Authors’ Response: We have added this keyword.
Background
1. Lines 38-39: Please specify the population you are referring to with regard to the
consequences of body dissatisfaction – is this among adults, men/women,
adolescents?
Authors’ Response: We have clarified this by adding “in adolescents and young adults of
both genders”
2. Lines 40-41 and 44-45 are repetitive in their relating of body dissatisfaction to a
desire to be thinner. Think about rearranging the first two paragraphs to improve
clarity and build the rationale.
Authors’ Response: We have restructured and combined these paragraphs as suggested.
3. I would also like greater reflection upon the reasons why women wish to be thinner
(e.g. exposure to, and internalisation of, the “thin ideal”), since this is central to the
argument for the paper and the implications of its findings.
Authors’ Response: We have rewritten the first paragraph as follows: “One main component
of body dissatisfaction relates to body size, with over 75% of adolescent girls reporting a
wish to be thinner (7), and this is often ascribed to “internalisation of the thin ideal” (the
idea that people compare themselves with internalised cultural beliefs about ideal body size)
(8)”
4. I believe the rationale for, and potential implications of, the paper, are more
appropriately placed for women in the general population, as opposed to the clinical
subsample with eating disorders, especially given the study sample. Whilst Study 2
included participants with high levels of body dissatisfaction, they were not assessed
for other symptoms of disordered eating, and it is therefore unfounded to suggest
that the findings could be applied a clinical groups with eating disorders.
Authors’ Response: We acknowledge that we haven’t tested this in a clinical population and
have removed the suggestion that this might be useful in such a population from the
introduction.
5. Lines 52-53: Careful with the use of “normal” and “ideal” – these could be actually
be considered have very different meanings with regard to appearance.
Authors’ Response: We have removed these terms from lines 52-53.
6. Line 54: Please replace the use of “fatter” with “larger”, as the former can have
negative connotations.
Authors’ Response: We have amended this as suggested.
7. Line 55: What does “normal” mean? In terms of BMI category? “Viewing
photographs of obese, as opposed..” – viewing by who?
Authors’ Response: We have clarified this as follows: “Viewing photographs of males whose
body mass index (BMI) was in the obese, as opposed to normal, category leads to both male
and female participants judging a man with a BMI in the overweight range to have a
healthy, normal weight.”
8. Lines 64-65: Please explain the potential benefits if body size perception may indeed
transfer across identities.
Authors’ Response: We have rewritten this in response to your comment and that of
Reviewer 2 as follows: “This suggests that photographs of others may change perception of
own size, but the studies were too small to be confident that these results did not arise by
chance.”
9. Lines 67-70: The description of this study and its findings is currently rather unclear –
please clarify.
Authors’ Response: We have rewritten the description of this study and hope that this has
made the description clearer.
10. Line 73: What eating disorders did the 20 patients have? (e.g. anorexia nervosa or
bulimia?)
Authors’ Response: We have clarified this as follows: “The studies included one group of 40
participants with high baseline body dissatisfaction and one group of 20 patients with
atypical anorexia nervosa”.
11. Lines 74-76: I think there needs to be a clearer consideration of why in addition to
perception of body size, it is equally (or perhaps more) important to examine
satisfaction with body size.
Authors’ Response: We have expanded our discussion on this point as follows: “In addition to
whether exposure to bodies of different sizes changes perception of own body size, another
important question is whether this changes satisfaction with own body size. Meta-analysis
concludes that in general women feel less satisfied with their bodies after viewing
photographs of thin models compared to neutral images or normal-sized models, however
these studies used models who differed from each other on more factors than simply size
(16); the use of fashion models also introduces more complexity in comparison to using
images of women who have not been made to look glamorous.”
12. Line 79: Why would food consumption be an important outcome?
Authors’ Response: We have added the following: “Whether food consumption increases or
decreases might enhance our understanding of how body dissatisfaction can influence
subsequent eating disorders or weight gain.”
13. Line 82: What does “normal” mean?
Authors’ Response: We have clarified this as “photographs of the same women whose BMI
was in the middle of the normal range”
14. Line 83: Are the weight categories in relation to BMI?
Authors’ Response: No – the stimuli were modified by increasing or decreasing the widths of
the bodies. The creation of the stimuli is described in detail in section 2.
15. Line 91: Why was chocolate selected?
Authors’ Response: We have discussed this choice in the Methods section as follows:
“Maltesers were chosen as they are a palatable snack food that most people like, and since
they are individually quite small, people might choose to eat a variable quantity.” However
we acknowledge that the choice of a chocolate snack may not have been ideal, and we have
added this to the discussion of limitations as follows: “the choice of chocolate as a snack may
not have been ideal, both because it is a food that some people crave, and because the
craving often involves both approach and avoidance, as well as feelings of guilt
Methods: Study One
1. Line 113: Please specify the BMI category for this range (e.g. normal?)
Authors’ Response: We have added that this is the normal range.
2. Lines 117-118: How many items comprise these measures? What is their internal
reliability?
Authors’ Response: We have expanded this section to include these details as follows:
“Participants completed the Body Dissatisfaction subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory
(EDI) (18) online before attending the session. The Body Dissatisfaction subscale comprises 9
items, and we scored them as suggested for a non-clinical population (19): four from 1
(Never) to 6 (Always) (e.g. “I think that my thighs are too large”), and five from 1 (Always) to
6 (Never) (e.g. “I think that my hips are just the right size”). The Body Dissatisfaction
subscale of the EDI has an internal reliability of 0.90 in a clinical, and 0.94 in a non-clinical,
sample (19). Participants completed the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) (20) during
the session, before completing the task, as mood may impact on body dissatisfaction(21, 22).
The PHQ-9 is a 9 item depression measure consisting of questions which score the DSM-IV
depression criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The scale has an internal
reliability of 0.89. “
3. Line 119: Please specify whether it is the Body Dissatisfaction subscale or PHQ-9
which captures mood, and provide a reference for the statement concerning the
influence of mood upon body dissatisfaction.
Authors’ Response: We have amended this to make it clear that the PHQ-9 is the mood
measure and provided references for the impact of mood on body dissatisfaction.
4. Lines 122-124: Were the two images from the task stimuli clothed or not?
Authors’ Response: We have clarified in the text that the task stimuli “ were dressed like the
task stimuli in a sports bra and shorts”.
5. It is concerning that the perceived size of the stimuli and one’s own body were
measured inconsistently (i.e. slightly underweight v too thin). “Too fat” could be
interpreted very differently to “slightly overweight”, as it could actually be
considered a measure of satisfaction with own body size, rather than a perception of
size.
Authors’ Response: We acknowledge the potential limitation of the wording of our question
regarding participant size. We have added the following statement to the list of limitations
of the study: “the wording of the task in which participants judged their own size included
the phrases “too fat” and “too thin”, which may have drawn on their feelings of satisfaction
with their body as well as their perception of their actual size.”
6. Line 152 – what did the training consist of?
Authors’ Response: The training is described in lines 166-175.
7. Line 196: Add “which” in between “available” and “restricted”.
Authors’ Response: We have rephrased this as “are available with restricted access”.
Results: Study One
1. Please include the demographics of your sample (and for Study 2).
Authors’ Response: We did not collect demographic data other than age and a requirement
that they have English as their first language. We have clarified this and added as a
potential limitation of the study: “we do not have data on their ethnicity or socio-economic
status; they therefore may not be representative of the national population of 18-25 year
olds.”
2. Line 238: Please provide figures for the binary group of ‘no’ versus ‘any’ chocolate
(also for Study 2 please).
Authors’ Response: We have added these.
Results: Study Two
1. Line 327: How were missing data addressed? (e.g. intent-to-treat analysis).
Authors’ Response: We have clarified this as follows: “Analysing using only data from those
participants who attended on both day, we found that…” and also added the following
analysis: “Repeating analyses including all participants, carrying forward the last available
observation (i.e. those collected immediately after the task) in those who did not attend
follow up, did not alter substantially alter these results.”
2. Lines 329-335: Please add findings relating to the follow-up to Table 1.
Authors’ Response: We have done so.
Discussion
1. Please include an introductory paragraph summarising the aims of the study, and
highlighting the novelty and importance of the study.
Authors’ Response: We have added an introductory paragraph as requested.
2. In addition to supporting previous research, please also consider how the study
findings may contrast with previous findings.
Authors’ Response: We did not feel that our findings did contrast with previous findings,
except in terms of methodology which we feel we have already covered.
3. Lines 353-355: There was no significant finding (i.e. p<0.05) for Study 1, so stating
there was “some evidence” is misleading. I would focus on the significance of the
findings for participants with baseline body dissatisfaction.
Authors’ Response: We have removed the suggestion that we found “some evidence”.
4. It was interesting to find that exposure to underweight images decreased the
perceived size of one’s own body – it might be interesting to reflect on this.
Authors’ Response: This looks as though it might be interesting, but the 95% confidence
intervals include the possibility that exposure to underweight images leads to perceiving own
size as larger, and we therefore don’t want to speculate about this for fear of over-
interpretation. We do note, however, that the changes in perception of size seem
predominantly to be driven by decreases in perception of own size following exposure to
normal or overweight images, and speculate as to why this might be.
5. Lines 356-358: Study 1 participants exposed to normal weight images actually
experiences greater satisfaction with their own body size compared with those
exposed to the overweight images – please acknowledge and consider why this may
be.
Authors’ Response: Again, although the point values suggest that the results are in this
direction, the difference between the group exposed to normal weight and the group
exposed to overweight images includes the possibility of no difference between groups (and
p=0.217). We don’t want to over-interpret this apparent difference.
6. It is also very interesting that exposure to underweight images led to increased
satisfaction with one’s own body size, and contrasts with previous research – please
acknowledge this positive effect
Authors’ Response: Again, although it seems that there is some increase in satisfaction
following exposure to underweight images, in both Study 1 and 2 the 95% Confidence
Intervals include the possibility of no change in satisfaction and we don’t want to over-
interpret our findings.
7. Limitations: The follow-up time could have been extended beyond 24 hours.
Authors’ Response: We have added the following to our list of limitations: “Sixth, the follow-
up time was only 24 hours, and we therefore do not know whether effects may last longer
than this.”
8. Lines 401-409: Given that findings were more evident for women with baseline
levels of body dissatisfaction, I think the implications of these findings for this group
can be drawn out further. How could media outlets be persuaded to change the size
of their models? Is there research suggesting that this wouldn’t affect sales?
Authors’ Response: Thank you. We have added that there is evidence to suggest that using
larger models would not alter sales from advertising.
9. Lines 413-416: I don’t think the findings can be applied to patients with eating
disorders, given the study sample. However, the authors might consider implications
for intervention for women at increased risk of an eating disorder (this also stands
for lines 422-424).
Authors’ Response: We have removed this suggestion and consider its potential use in
reducing high levels of body dissatisfaction with the aim of preventing eating disorders.
10. It would be pleasing for the authors to consider avenues for future research, one of
which may be to assess these disordered eating symptoms as an outcome.
Authors’ Response: We have added this as suggested.
Figures and Tables
1. Table 1: Please add the units of measurement for height and weight, and the results
for the follow-up assessment, and chocolate consumed.
Authors’ Response: We have done this.
Reviewer: 2
1. The present manuscript reported on two experimental studies examining the effects
of exposure to images of women at different ends of the weight spectrum. I have a
number of concerns about the manuscript in its current form including (Overall
comments) Throughout the report, I would suggest some changes in terms of the
framing. For example, study 1 reports to use “healthy” women as compared to the
women with “high body dissatisfaction” recruited for study 2. The implication is that
body dissatisfaction is “unhealthy.” It is indeed an important concerns associated
with increased risk for other physical and psychological disorders, however
“unhealthy” is an odd description. Similarly, I would suggest considering providing
more framing to the terms “normal weight,” “overweight,” “normal,” “attractive,”
and “fatter.”
Authors’ Response: Thank you for this useful feedback. We address your concerns
individually below.
In terms of the framing of the study, we have removed the term “healthy” from our
description of Study 1 women, which we feel removes the implication that the Study 2
women with high body dissatisfaction are “unhealthy”.
We now describe “normal weight”, “overweight” and “underweight” in our first mention of
these in relation to our studies, and thereafter use the terms in inverted commas. Our single
use of the word “attractive” is in relation to a specific study which used that word with its
participants. We now also use the term in inverted commas.
Abstract:
1. it was unclear to me from the description of study 1 how may conditions there were.
Authors’ Response: We have clarified this as follows: “women with normal BMI were
randomised into one of three groups to complete a 15 min two-back task”
Introduction:
1. Overall the introduction provides a good overview of the literature, however, there
is a need to be more specific in use of terminology, as well as clarifying the gap filled
by the current study.
Authors’ Response: We have rewritten much of the introduction to be more specific about
previous findings, and have added the following to the beginning of the introduction
describing what our study adds: “The studies presented here build on the previous literature
to investigate whether the change in perception of body size of others extends to perception
of and satisfaction with own body size, and how long such effects last.”
2. For example, on page 4, line 64, the authors interpret the findings from the studies
mentioned as suggesting that “body size perceptions may transfer across identities”.
What exactly is meant by identities?
Authors’ Response: We agree that this was unclear and have rewritten it as follows: “This
suggests that photographs of others may change perception of own size, but the studies
were too small to be confident that these results did not arise by chance.”
3. Similarly, the relationship between body image and eating disorder needs to be
clarified. Relatedly, when the authors describe that a study decreased eating
disorder symptoms for 2 weeks, are these behavioral symptoms or more body image
related ones.
Authors’ Response: Following feedback from both reviewers, we have removed our
suggestion that the current work is immediately applicable to people with an eating
disorder. However we have included the description of the Gledhill 2017 study as it is directly
relevant to the perception of body size. We have clarified the symptoms of eating disorders
which showed change following the intervention as follows: “Doing so resulted in decreased
levels of eating disorder symptoms (shape, weight and eating concerns), which were
sustained for two weeks (17).”
4. How is the sentence at the bottom of page 4 regarding behavioral outcomes (food
consumption) related to this study? This needs further contextualization. The link
between eating behavior and body image should be clarified.
Authors’ Response: We have added the following regarding the contextualisation of eating
as a behavioural outcome: “Whether food consumption increases or decreases might
enhance our understanding of how body dissatisfaction can influence subsequent eating
disorders or weight gain.”
5. Given that the current study focuses only on women, it would be good to have a
little more consideration of gender. For example, on page 3, line 55 the authors
describe some research among males- how does this fit in with the current study.
Authors’ Response: With regard to the study including male subjects, we have amended the
paragraph as follows: “There is some evidence that exposing people to images of bodies of
different sizes does alter their perception of others’ body size. The female body size viewed
by women as being most “normal” and “attractive” becomes thinner after exposure to
thinner bodies, and larger following exposure to larger bodies (10, 11). Viewing photographs
of males whose body mass index (BMI) was in the obese, as opposed to normal, category
leads to both male and female participants judging a man with a BMI in the overweight
range to have a healthy, normal weight (12, 13). Although two of these studies included only
images of women, and two only images of men, the results across both were consistent in
terms of a change in perception of body size.”
With regard to defending our focus on women, we have added: “Given the higher prevalence
of body dissatisfaction in women than men, we decided that these studies would focus on
women only.”
6. In the introduction line 41, it is odd to say that treatments for eating disorders have
had little success in treating body image, as body image disturbance in the context of
an eating disorder may be different to body image in other contexts.
Authors’ Response: As both reviewers felt that our current work is not applicable to people
with an eating disorder, we have removed this statement from the first paragraph.
7. The sentence page 5, line 88 is confusing to me
Authors’ Response: We have rewritten the sentence as follows: “We then tested whether
such exposure to different sized bodies, can change satisfaction with own body size.”
8. Why chocolate? This needs more detail as chocolate is a particular food in the
context of disordered eating in that it is particularly craved, and also is often
perceived as an unhealthy food.
Authors’ Response: Please see our response to reviewer one, where we explain our choice
and also acknowledge this choice as a potential limitation.
Methods:
1. The authors should describe each of the measures in more detail including the
scoring, an example item, support for its psychometric properties from past studies,
as well as the psychometric properties in the current study.
Authors’ Response: We have described these measures in detail as requested by both
reviewers.
2. Did the authors do any piloting with the stimuli to see if the widened and narrowed
bodies were perceived by participants as realistic?
Authors’ Response: We didn’t do any pilot work of this kind, which is a possible limitation of
the study and we have added the following to our section on limitations: “we did not pilot
the images to see whether they were viewed as realistic.”
3. Can the authors speak to the ethnic identity and body shapes (muscularity etc.) of
the 10 women chosen to provide the stimuli for the study?
Authors’ Response: All the women in the images were White as this was what was available
in the dataset we were using. We have added this to the description and to the potential
limitations. We would be happy to provide the stimuli set online for interested readers;
please let us know if you feel that would be helpful.
4. Why was BMI restricted to 19-25 in study 1?
Authors’ Response: This was chosen as a normal range of values. In retrospect more inclusive
values would have been better and that is why this range was extended in Study 2.
5. Why was 35 chosen as a cutoff for the BDI scale in study 2?
Authors’ Response: We have amended Study 2 methods to add: “this value was chosen as it
corresponded to the top quartile of scores in Study 1”.
Results:
1. It would be helpful to number the hypotheses listed at the end of the introduction
and then refer back to them in this way in the results section.
Authors’ Response: Thank you for this helpful suggestion, we have done so.
2. Unless I am missing a methodological reason for this not being possible, I would
suggest combining the participants from studies 1 and 2 so as to increase statistical
power and observe whether body dissatisfaction moderated the changes in body
size perception and satisfaction.
Authors’ Response: Thank you for this suggestion, we have added to our methodology a
description of running a “mega-analysis”, incorporating results from both studies as well as
a variable to indicate whether each data point was from Study 1 or 2. We have added the
results from this further analysis to the Study 2 results, tables, abstract and discussion.
Discussion:
1. Again in the discussion section it would be good to clarify which of the findings are
novel and how they build upon previous work.
Authors’ Response: In response to both this comment and the comment from Reviewer 1, we
have added a new first paragraph highlighting our novel findings and explaining how they
build on previous work.
2. My reading of the literature suggests that the finding that repeated exposure to
underweight models orients individuals to lower body weight norms is not a novel
one.
Authors’ Response: We acknowledge that the literature has demonstrated that exposure to
underweight models changes perception of weight of others. We believe the novelty of our
results is in the finding that this generalises both to perception of own size (previously only
found in small samples of N=14/16), and to satisfaction with own size, and that changes in
satisfaction with own size last until at least 24 hours later. We hope that our new first
paragraph of the Discussion makes this clearer.
Appendix C
Dear Alice Power,
Re: Manuscript RSOS-171387.R1: Effects of exposure to bodies of different sizes on
perception of and satisfaction with own body size: two randomised studies.
Many thanks for giving us the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ further comments
on our paper, which we address individually below.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Antonia Hamilton)
1. There are still a few more important changes to be made in line with the reviewer
comments
Authors’ Response: We address the reviewers’ specific comments below.
Reviewer: 1
1. Many thanks for addressing my comments, your changes and clarifications have
improved the manuscript. However, I still have several concerns that require attention.
Authors’ Response: Thank you for this positive input. We address your specific concerns
individually below.
2. Lines 17-18: sentence beginning "Exposure to different..": This sentence lacks clarity,
and could be explained more simply (e.g. Exposure to bodies of different sizes etc). The
use of "normal weight" doesn't feel quite right, it may be clearer to use the word
"normal" within speech marks.
Authors’ Response: We have rewritten this as suggested: “Exposure to images of bodies of
different sizes has been suggested to change the perception of “normal” body size in others.”
3. Lines 43-44: Only one study has been cited regarding prevalence, please consider a
greater body of research.
Authors’ Response: We have added the following, “It is common, with prevalence studies
finding 35% of adolescent girls (6), and two thirds of adult women (7) are dissatisfied with
their bodies”, and we have also expanded the references with regard to desire for thinness,
in response to your comment below.
4. Lines 44-46: Given that your research is conducted with adult women, please consider
research demonstrating a desire for thinness among this group too.
Authors’ Response: We have added the following regarding this desire in an adult women
group: “One main component of body dissatisfaction relates to body size, with over 75% of
adolescent girls, (7) and over 95% of adult women (8) reporting a wish to be thinner, and
74% of adult women reporting a wish to lose weight (9).”
5. Lines 46-48: This is an odd and unfamiliar description of internalisation. Consider that
coined by Thompson et al., 1999 - which is commonly employed and understood
within the wider body image field.
Authors’ Response: We have rewritten this as follows and referenced Thompson et al’s work
as well as that by Stice which pre-dates it: “the idea that individuals, to differing amounts,
try to conform to, media-driven, socially-defined ideas of attractiveness, including body size”.
6. Line 77: Given that this limitation in previous research forms part of the rationale for
the current study, please expand on the factors by which the models differed beyond
their size. Also, I find your argument somewhat contradictory of your final implications
- given that you use "non-model" women who have not been made to look glamorous
as your experimental stimuli, yet your study implications are for advertising - which
includes professional glamorous models. So can you infer these implications?
Authors’ Response: We have expanded our description of the limitations in previous research
as follows: “Meta-analysis (18) concludes that in general women feel less satisfied with their
bodies after viewing photographs of thin models compared to neutral images or normal-
sized models. However, of the 80 studies included in the meta-analysis, 75 either had no
control group, or compared viewing thin models with neutral images of some sort, including
two which used images of older men and women, and infants and children playing (19, 20),
which does not give insight into what aspects of the women’s bodies might be having this
effect. Of those using women’s bodies in the control group, one study used images which
were chosen to vary according to attractiveness rather than weight (21), and one used
television footage of “thin and attractive” women in the experimental group and compared
this with “not thin or attractive” women in the control group (22), again leaving it uncertain
whether the differences were due to factors relating to attractiveness or to weight. Two
studies used clothing adverts or fashion models from women’s magazines in the
experimental group, but compared them with “pictures from specialised women’s clothing
catalogs” for “more amply furnished women” in one case (23), and “overweight bordering
on obese women” from other magazines in the other (24). It seems likely that such images
would vary in terms of the attractiveness and glamour of the images as well as their size and
weight. Only one study attempted to look at the effects of body satisfaction of photographs
which varied on weight alone, using the face of one woman pasted onto either a relatively
slim or an overweight body (25). This study found lower levels of body satisfaction in the
group shown a single overweight image. However, the study did not measure baseline levels
of body satisfaction, so it is possible that these differences between groups were pre-
existing. Interpreting the results is further complicated by the study scenario, in which the
women were told that they were about to meet a male participant who would choose
whether he would rather go on a date with her or another woman, whose photograph they
were purportedly being shown. One further small study (N=40, randomised into four groups)
used a single black and white print advert for Kraft cheese, featuring an “attractive female
model” in two conditions, and a version using the model altered to appear overweight using
Adobe Photoshop (no further details of the manipulation are reported) in a further two
conditions; participants rated self-attractiveness after viewing the image for 15 seconds.
Self-attractiveness ratings were lower following exposure to the “overweight” models, but
again no baseline measurements were taken (27).”
We have removed the argument that the use of fashion models may introduce more
complexity as we take your point about this contradicting our conclusions.
7. Lines 80-88: I wonder whether discussion of this study is better places in the
discussion, in conjunction with future research. I feel it is oddly placed here, as you are
not including a sample of women with disordered eating/an eating disorder.
Alternatively, perhaps you could focus on the group with baseline body dissatisfaction.
Also, how does this study differ substantially from the current study?
Authors’ Response: As you have suggested, we have shifted the focus of the description of
this study to describe in more detail the results for a group with high baseline body
dissatisfaction, which is analogous to our Study 2, as follows: “One recent paper has
examined whether giving feedback on participants’ judgement as to the size of others’
bodies can reduce clinical eating disorder symptom scores. Forty participants with high
baseline body dissatisfaction were shown a series of CGI images of women’s bodies and
asked to rate each of them as “fat” or “thin”. They were then randomised to either
complete a “training” task in which they were given feedback regarding whether their
response was correct or not, with the aim of shifting the threshold where they began to
perceive a body as fat, or a control task where the feedback was consistent with their
baseline judgements. The training task successfully shifted their perception of the cut off
between “fat” and “thin” bodies within the task, and resulted in decreased levels of eating
disorder symptoms (shape, weight and eating concerns), which were sustained for two
weeks (26). Results were replicated in 20 patients with atypical anorexia nervosa,
raising the possibility that such interventions may be a useful adjunct in eating disorder
treatment.”
Hopefully our more detailed description of this study makes the difference from our study
(namely, explicit training on which images are “fat” and which “thin”) clearer. We have
also clarified this difference further on in the introduction as follows: “The studies
presented here build on the previous literature to investigate whether the change in
perception of body size of others extends to perception of and satisfaction with own body
size, even without giving explicit “training” instructions about which bodies are “fat” or
“thin”…”
8. Lines 91-93: This statement is misleading, as each eating disorder has different
characteristics with regard to eating. Findings from the current study would not inform
whether and if so, which, eating disorder the individual may develop. Arguably,
someone with body dissatisfaction may eat more chocolate and eventually go on to
develop bulimia or binge eating disorder, or they may eat none and eventually go one
to develop anorexia. So the amount of chocolate eaten will not actually inform us of
whether someone is more likely to develop an eating disorder. Given that this is the
case, and that the measure of chocolate consumption is the aspect of your study which
differentiates it from previous studies, I question the true useful novelty of your study.
Authors’ Response: We agree that it is hard to predict whether participants would eat more
or less chocolate according to whether they felt more or less satisfied with their body, but we
felt that it would be interesting to see which (if either) was the case. That is why we stated
“Whether food consumption increases or decreases might enhance our understanding of
how body dissatisfaction can influence subsequent eating disorders or weight gain.”
We disagree that chocolate consumption is the only aspect of our study which differentiates
it from previous studies. We have extensively critiqued the existing literature and have
described the limitations of previous studies and what our study adds. Briefly, both our
studies are 6 times larger than previous studies, which were underpowered to test whether
exposure to different-sized, but otherwise identical, images of women’s bodies, changes
perception of own body size. Ours is the only study to use simple exposure to bodies of
different sizes to test whether this changes in satisfaction with own size, using baseline and
follow up measures of satisfaction. It is also novel in testing whether any such changes are
still present at 24 hour follow up.
9. Lines 412-413: Please consider why no differences were found in chocolate
consumption.
Authors’ Response: We have added the following, which also touches on your comment 8
above: “We did not find any overall effect of exposure to images of different sizes on
chocolate consumption, which may be due to individual variation in whether a change in
satisfaction with own size leads to the consumption of more or less chocolate.”
We have also highlighted the potential limitation of the use of chocolate as follows:
“Eighth, the choice of chocolate as a snack may not have been ideal, both because it is a
food that some people crave, and because the craving often involves both approach and
avoidance, as well as feelings of guilt (35).”
10. Lines 476-479: It is too much of a leap to suggest such an intervention for groups with
an eating disorder. Surely the first step would be to conduct the current study among
this group?
Authors’ Response: We agree that there is no current evidence to use this intervention with
people with an eating disorder, and we meant to suggest what you have described, namely
that a study in this population would be useful. We have re written this to make it clearer,
as follows: “Future research could usefully investigate whether such an intervention is
effective in patients with a diagnosed eating disorder.”
Reviewer: 2
1. The authors have been very responsive to the feedback provided on their
manuscript, which is much improved. However, I have some additional suggestions
before recommending the manuscript for publication.
Authors’ Response: Thank you. We have responded to your additional suggestions below.
2. I think that the additions that the authors have made to the beginning paragraph of
the manuscript are useful for situating the current study, however, I wonder if the
implications are more for the alteration of perception of desired body size rather
than actual size? As the authors highlight, it is the comparison with the thin-ideal
that generally leads to body dissatisfaction rather than very inaccurate body size
perception.
Authors’ Response: In our study, we were interested in testing the hypothesis that
exposure to bodies of different sizes changes actual perception of, as well as satisfaction
with, own size, so we have not changed this hypothesis within the introduction. However,
as you point out, it is possible that the effects we found with relation to satisfaction with
body size were due to a change in the “thin ideal”. We have added this possible
explanation to the Discussion as follows: “It is possible that the change in satisfaction
with own size may be due to exposure to different sized bodies changing the internalised
“ideal” body size to which women compare their own bodies, as well as to a change in
perceived own size.”
3. The study that is described lines 52-60 seems to be illustrating change in body size
evaluation (as being attractive etc.) rather than perception I think? This seems
similar to the authors’ hypothesis regarding effects of the manipulation on body
satisfaction. In contrast the study described lines 62-70 does indeed look at body size
perception. This seems closer to the hypothesis regarding the size-perception of the
bodies of others. Here too it would be good to be very specific.
Authors’ Response: The four papers described in lines 52-60 include both size-based and
evaluative judgments of others’ bodies. We have rewritten the paragraph in order to
clarify these two distinct ideas, as follows: “There is some evidence that exposing people
to images of bodies of different sizes alters their perception of others’ body size, in that it
changes their idea of what is considered to be a “normal” size for others’ bodies. The
female body size viewed as being most “normal” becomes thinner after exposure to
thinner bodies, and larger following exposure to larger bodies (12, 13). Viewing
photographs of males whose body mass index (BMI) was in the obese, as opposed to
normal, category leads to both male and female participants judging a man with a BMI
in the overweight range to have a healthy, normal weight (14, 15). Although two of these
studies included only images of women, and two only images of men, the results across
both were consistent in terms of a change in what constitutes a “normal” body size in
others. The body size perceived as most attractive also became smaller following
exposure to thinner as opposed to larger bodies (12, 13).”
4. Line 320, could the authors clarify what is meant by a mega-analysis?
Authors’ Response: We have clarified this as follows: “We also subsequently conducted a
series of mega-analyses, in which we repeated all the analyses we have described,
incorporating the results from both Study One and Study Two into each analysis. The
analyses were identical to those described for the individual studies, except that we included
a variable to indicate whether each data point was from Study One or Study Two.
5. Line 468, I commend the authors for clarifying that data suggest that using average
size women in advertising does not compromise effectiveness. I suggest also
highlighting here that these data also supported that advertisements with average
size women were protective of body image.
Authors’ Response: Thank you. We have clarified this as follows: “The results of our study
suggest that encouraging media outlets to choose models of a normal body size would be
likely to lead to women perceiving their own size as smaller, and feeling more positive about
their own body size”
