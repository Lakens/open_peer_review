By means of three clever psychophysical experiments, Mather and Sharman investigated whether
adaptation to implied motion mainly occurs at the sensory or at the decision level. They adapted
to implied motion by means of uncorrelated static images depicting left or right motion direction
(in different sessions), and then measured the threshold (mean amount of displacement needed to
reach 82% of correct responses) for discriminating leftward vs. rightward motion in a RDK-like
stimulus.
Results showed that adaptation to implied motion is able to shift the threshold depending on the
direction of adapting and test stimulus (direction-selective adaptation). However, when the shift
in threshold was measured with a non-directional task (reporting the location of the coherently
moving dots, irrespective of their direction), no signs adaptation were found. This suggests that
adaptation to implied motion occurs at the decision level.
This is an intriguing and well-designed study that can shed some light on the true nature of
motion adaptation to static images (yet depicting motion), and on the level of processing at which
such adaptation occurs.
I have the following minor comments:
The introduction or the discussion section could benefit from the discussion of a recent study by
Faivre & Kock (2014), where adaptation to implied motion occurs with visible but not with
invisible adapting stimuli, thus possibly suggesting an high-level source for the representation of
implied motion.
Also, how does a decision-level explanation of adaptation to implied motion fit with the finding
that implied motion also influences the perceived position of stationary objects (Pavan et al.,
2011)?
It could be nice to test the sensory- vs. decision-level adaptation to implied motion using TMS
over sensory/perceptual areas coding for visual motion during a short interval between adapting
and test stimulus.
In the methods section it is not clear how many sessions and how many trials per session were
administered for each participant.
Please specify if in Experiment 2 and 3 the same one-tailed two-factor repeated measures
ANOVA was used, as in Experiment 1.

Regarding details:
Can you report the mean and variability of age among your observers?
I can infer that the eight participants took part in all three experiments, though this is not
explicitly stated. Did they all perform the experiments in the same order?
I can infer that, for each experiment, one session was performed with leftward implied motion
and one session with rightward implied motion. This is a little fuzzy when you say, “In half of
the sessions the adapting stimuli implied rightwards motion, and in the remaining sessions the
adapting stimuli implied leftwards motion.” (italics mine) If there were more than one each this
should be explicit.
I similarly infer that, for a given session, exactly one staircase was used to estimate threshold for
leftward motion and exactly one staircase was used to estimate threshold for rightward motion.
Regarding significance:
Many would argue against discussing main effect significance in the presence of a significant
interaction. The main effect of test direction could be justified by virtue of the fact that both L test
thresholds are higher than both R test thresholds, so its significance can stand despite the
significant interaction. This might be worth highlighting. The non-significant main effect of
adapting direction may not be worth detailing given the difference in magnitude of test direction
effect for the two adapt conditions (i.e. the interaction).
Regarding conditions:
The inherent bias in thresholds, what would become your main effect of test direction, may not
have been expected, however it seems an obvious omission to not include a non-adapt or neutral
adapt (equal measures of leftward and rightward implied motion) condition. This could have
more cleanly established the inherent bias in thresholds, and obviate the need to establish a main
effect of test direction from the adaptation conditions.
This was a well executed experiment and a good write up. My own proclivities leave me
wanting more details, but the presentation is pleasantly clean and clear. I would encourage only
minor revisions as suggested above.

Abstract: Prolonged exposure to visual stimuli causes a bias in observers’ responses to
subsequent stimuli. Such adaptation-induced biases are usually explained in terms of changes in
the relative activity of sensory neurons in the visual system which respond selectively to the
properties of visual stimuli. However, the bias could also be due to a shift in the observer’s
criterion for selecting one response rather than the alternative; adaptation at the decision level of
processing rather than the sensory level. We investigated whether adaptation to implied motion
is best attributed to sensory-level or decision-level bias. Three experiments sought to isolate
decision factors by changing the nature of the participants’ task while keeping the sensory
stimulus unchanged. Results showed that adaptation-induced bias in reported stimulus direction
only occurred when the participant’s task involved a directional judgement, and disappeared
when adaptation was measured using a non-directional task (reporting where motion was
present in the display, regardless of its direction). We conclude that adaptation to implied motion
is due to decision-level bias, and that a propensity towards such biases may be widespread in
sensory decision-making.

COMMENT The introduction or the discussion section could
benefit from the discussion of a recent study by Faivre & Kock
(2014), where adaptation to implied motion occurs with visible
but not with invisible adapting stimuli, thus possibly
suggesting an high-level source for the representation of
implied motion.
RESPONSE We have added this citation to the Introduction, as
suggested.
COMMENT Also, how does a decision-level explanation of
adaptation to implied motion fit with the finding that implied
motion also influences the perceived position of stationary
objects (Pavan et al., 2011)?
RESPONSE We have added a comment in the Discussion indicating
that decision-level adaptation may have contributed to the
position shift effect reported by Pavan et al. (2011), because
the participants’ task in that study was directional.
COMMENT It could be nice to test the sensory- vs. decision-
level adaptation to implied motion using TMS over
sensory/perceptual areas coding for visual motion during a
short interval between adapting and test stimulus.
RESPONSE Thank you for this suggestion, which is a good idea
that we will pursue in the lab.
