This manuscript aims to examine in chimpanzees whether atypical early experiences, especially
the extent of interactions with humans, are related to hair cortisol – an integrative measure of
cortisol concentrations across a moderate time period – later in life. The study utilizes an
impressive longitudinal dataset to answer a question that is likely to be of interest to a wide range
of people, from those who are interested in the role of more naturalistic early life adversity to
those who are interested in animal welfare. Although I think this manuscript could make a
meaningful contribution to the literature, I have a few major concerns with the manuscript in its
current form, as well as several more minor concerns and suggestions, listed below:
(1) The rationale for examining the role of atypical experience on stress physiology is currently
inadequate. To make the reason for examining hair cortisol clearer, the authors should make
more explicit links between stress physiology and social behavior and deficits, as well as long-
term health and welfare. A bit more discussion of what the HPA axis does, the functional role of
glucocorticoids, and what it means to have “high” or “low” (basal) cortisol would also be helpful,
given that it’s your primary outcome measure.
(2) Accordingly, there is a major focus in the current manuscript on the effects of atypical
experience on social behaviors (rather than focusing on the effects of atypical experience on stress
physiology). It seems like the authors have both the cortisol and social behavior/deficit data, so
why not look at the relation of hair cortisol to social behaviors/deficits in adulthood? (if they do
in fact have both datasets, which I realize I am simply assuming!) In my opinion, making a link
between these two outcomes would substantially strengthen the manuscript.
(3) Please add a bit more information on CHI Index in the Method for those unfamiliar with the
previous paper references. For example, were data collected the same way across all testing sites,
were these scan or detailed behavioral data, how frequently, etc? This would be helpful in
clarifying what precisely a score of .25 (or .30, or .75, etc.) really means for a chimpanzee. Also,
was there full lifespan data available for all chimpanzees, or for some individuals were there
significant missing periods of time?
(4) Along these lines, the index is currently described as indicating “the degree to which
individuals were exposed to humans and/or chimpanzees throughout their life”. But the
Introduction focuses heavily on the role of atypical experiences early in life and at
developmentally sensitive periods. There should be some discussion, whether in the
Introduction, Discussion, or both, on whether these atypical experiences might have different
effects depending upon when they occurred in the lifespan, and/or how long atypical
experiences lasted.
(5) How consistent were cortisol concentrations within an individual, across testing times? Given
that hair cortisol is an integrative biomarker indicative of long-term cortisol, it would be really
interesting to know this. I’m also curious as to whether the relation between CHI and cortisol
concentration are relatively consistent within an individual across these different testing period.
(6) Was there an effect of testing site (arm or back) on cortisol concentrations? This could easily be
included in the model, or at least tested and ruled out.
(7) Given that both sex and CHI independently predict hair cortisol, I would suggest examining
whether sex moderates the effect of CHI on hair cortisol concentrations. Also, although it
shouldn’t change the overall results, would be helpful to know whether sex was associated with
CHI (e.g., if males had significantly higher CHI indices than females), even if there was no
evidence for collinearity in the model itself.
(8) In the data posted online, each subject is represented by a single row, and I assume that the
single cortisol value reported there is the logged average cortisol concentration across all testing
periods. Were these the data used in analyses, or was a long form data set used instead (in which
3
each subject was represented multiple times and the cortisol concentration would be the logged
value from that particular hair cortisol testing session)? The way the analyses are currently
described makes it sound like a long form data set was used, and if this is the case, then I would
suggest the authors post that original data. If not, then the Analysis section should be amended,
or (preferably) the analyses should be redone on the long form data.
(9) Finally, the Discussion feels a bit unnecessarily speculative and focused on social behaviors
and deficits, instead of properly interpreting the results the authors present in this manuscript.
Again, I’d either suggest incorporating some behavioral data and the relation between cortisol
and social behavior (if the data are available) or refocusing on the actual relations and
physiological results presented.

This study describes the effects of early life experience on chimpanzee hair cortisol levels. The
study revealed that individuals who had atypical early life history showed higher level of hair
cortisol level as adults in both sexes. I think this study is quite important and I have positive
impression overall, but several points should be clarified before publication.
Introduction
1. L62-70: The authours discussed the effects of humans on the behaviors on chimpanzees. I think
there are various types of interaction when the chimpanzees were reared during infancy. For
example, intensive hand-rearing by humans can differ from more neglected types of hand-
rearing practices. They just mentioned the enculturation effects from intensive early interactions
but there should be more. It can also be included here or in discussion section as this study
mainly discuss the differences in human exposure levels of chimpanzees.
2. L102: I think the study found the effects of early experience on hair cortisol levels irrespective
of their relocation status, so it might be better to remove “after relocation”.
Methods
1. L136-140: I understand the authours already published the previous studies related to CHI, but
it might be better to include some more information. For example, how many years of records the
4
authours collected for each chimp? How much information could be collected for each chimp? I
guess there were missing information for some chimpanzees because the authours also included
the old chimpanzees which might lack some of the detailed information.
2. L144-146: The authours collected hair samples from two body locations. The previous studies
suggested the differences of the HC levels depending on the body locations. It is better to include
the variables into statistical analysis.
3. Please include the data on intra- and inter- assay variability.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The authors have revised the manuscript in accordance with reviewer comments, however, I
would like to see three of reviewer #1's comments addressed more fully:
My response to how comment 4 was addressed by authors: The introduction should be revised in
places to draw the focus somewhat away from early life experiences or at least to relate these to
behaviour later in life that could be relevant to analysing cortisol samples throughout life (see
also comment 9 below).
My response to how comment 5 was addressed by authors: This comment should be addressed
more adequately for example with a supplementary table or figure?
My response to how comment 9 was addressed by authors: The authors do more to focus on the
HPA axis in discussing their results. In particular in making the link between atypical
experiences and heightened cortisol levels and what these mean for later life - here there is work
in humans and outside of primates as well (e.g., mice) that can be accessed.

he rationale for examining the role of atypical experience on stress physiology is currently
equate. To make the reason for examining hair cortisol clearer, the authors should make more
icit links between stress physiology and social behavior and deficits, as well as long-term health and
fare. A bit more discussion of what the HPA axis does, the functional role of glucocorticoids, and
t it means to have “high” or “low” (basal) cortisol would also be helpful, given that it’s your primary
come measure.
have added more information about the HPA axis to address this issue (lines 93-101).
Accordingly, there is a major focus in the current manuscript on the effects of atypical experience on
al behaviors (rather than focusing on the effects of atypical experience on stress physiology). It
ms like the authors have both the cortisol and social behavior/deficit data, so why not look at the
tion of hair cortisol to social behaviors/deficits in adulthood? (if they do in fact have both datasets,
ch I realize I am simply assuming!) In my opinion, making a link between these two outcomes would
stantially strengthen the manuscript.
al behavior data was presented in a previous manuscript in relation to the CHI index for some of the
panzee population, but unfortunately combining this with the cortisol data is not logistically feasible
this dataset.
Please add a bit more information on CHI Index in the Method for those unfamiliar with the previous
er references. For example, were data collected the same way across all testing sites, were these
or detailed behavioral data, how frequently, etc? This would be helpful in clarifying what precisely
ore of .25 (or .30, or .75, etc.) really means for a chimpanzee. Also, was there full lifespan data
lable for all chimpanzees, or for some individuals were there significant missing periods of time?
have added details about the CHI index to the methods section (lines 141-151). This is a broad
gorization of exposure based on the chimpanzee’s known situation at the time, not requiring any
iled historical records. The location of each chimpanzee was known throughout their lifetime.
Along these lines, the index is currently described as indicating “the degree to which individuals were
osed to humans and/or chimpanzees throughout their life”. But the Introduction focuses heavily on
role of atypical experiences early in life and at developmentally sensitive periods. There should be
e discussion, whether in the Introduction, Discussion, or both, on whether these atypical
eriences might have different effects depending upon when they occurred in the lifespan, and/or
long atypical experiences lasted.
agree that the timing of these experiences could have a more significant impact if they occur in the
elopmental period, so we have added this point to our discussion (lines 279-281). The CHI index does
into account the length of the exposure to humans, so we believe we have addressed this aspect.
have also changed the title of the manuscript to reflect the broader focus on experiences throughout
life of the chimpanzees rather than just during their early life.
How consistent were cortisol concentrations within an individual, across testing times? Given that
cortisol is an integrative biomarker indicative of long-term cortisol, it would be really interesting to
w this. I’m also curious as to whether the relation between CHI and cortisol concentration are
tively consistent within an individual across these different testing period.
average, the range between cortisol concentrations for an individual was 5.46 ng/mg.
Was there an effect of testing site (arm or back) on cortisol concentrations? This could easily be
uded in the model, or at least tested and ruled out.
ortunately we were unable to include this variable in analysis due to insufficient reporting about the
tion of samples from the institutions. We agree that it could improve analysis, but think it is unlikely
a difference in sample location would drive our results.
Given that both sex and CHI independently predict hair cortisol, I would suggest examining whether
moderates the effect of CHI on hair cortisol concentrations. Also, although it shouldn’t change the
rall results, would be helpful to know whether sex was associated with CHI (e.g., if males had
ificantly higher CHI indices than females), even if there was no evidence for collinearity in the model
f.
model with the interaction between sex and CHI was not significantly different from the model
out the interaction. We agree that this is important information to include and have added this
lt (lines 208-209).
n the data posted online, each subject is represented by a single row, and I assume that the single
isol value reported there is the logged average cortisol concentration across all testing periods.
e these the data used in analyses, or was a long form data set used instead (in which each subject
represented multiple times and the cortisol concentration would be the logged value from that
icular hair cortisol testing session)? The way the analyses are currently described makes it sound like
ng form data set was used, and if this is the case, then I would suggest the authors post that original
. If not, then the Analysis section should be amended, or (preferably) the analyses should be redone
he long form data.
dataset that was originally posted was the wrong version and we attempted to send in an updated
ion, but it appears it was not made available to the reviewers. The correct dataset with the long form
a which was used in analysis, has now been updated with Dryad.
inally, the Discussion feels a bit unnecessarily speculative and focused on social behaviors and
cits, instead of properly interpreting the results the authors present in this manuscript. Again, I’d
er suggest incorporating some behavioral data and the relation between cortisol and social behavior
he data are available) or refocusing on the actual relations and physiological results presented.
have added some discussion of what these physiological results mean for the wellbeing of the
viduals (lines 215-217). We have also refocused other parts of our discussion on the physiological
lts (lines 237-238, 251-254) in an attempt to address the concern.

62-70: The authours discussed the effects of humans on the behaviors on chimpanzees. I think there
various types of interaction when the chimpanzees were reared during infancy. For example,
nsive hand-rearing by humans can differ from more neglected types of hand-rearing practices. They
mentioned the enculturation effects from intensive early interactions but there should be more. It
also be included here or in discussion section as this study mainly discuss the differences in human
osure levels of chimpanzees.
have added hand rearing interactions to the introduction (lines 62-64).
102: I think the study found the effects of early experience on hair cortisol levels irrespective of their
cation status, so it might be better to remove “after relocation”.
r review of the manuscript by Yamanashi et al., we decided to remove “after relocation” as
gested (lines 106-108).
hods
136-140: I understand the authours already published the previous studies related to CHI, but it
ht be better to include some more information. For example, how many years of records the
hours collected for each chimp? How much information could be collected for each chimp? I guess
e were missing information for some chimpanzees because the authours also included the old
panzees which might lack some of the detailed information.
have added more detail to our methods section about how CHI was calculated using historical
rds (lines 141-151). This is a broad categorization of exposure based on the chimpanzees’ known
ation at the time, not requiring any detailed historical records. The location of each chimpanzee was
wn throughout their lifetime.
144-146: The authours collected hair samples from two body locations. The previous studies
gested the differences of the HC levels depending on the body locations. It is better to include the
ables into statistical analysis.
tated in our response to Reviewer 1, we were unable to include this variable in analysis due to
fficient reporting from the participating institutions. While we recognize the potential that body
tion has to influence cortisol concentrations in general, we feel it is unlikely to affect the results from
sample.
lease include the data on intra- and inter- assay variability.
intra- and inter-assay variabilities have been added to the methods section (lines 181-182).

ponse to the Editor
authors have revised the manuscript in accordance with reviewer comments, however, I would like
ee three of reviewer #1's comments addressed more fully:
response to how comment 4 was addressed by authors: The introduction should be revised in places
raw the focus somewhat away from early life experiences or at least to relate these to behaviour
r in life that could be relevant to analysing cortisol samples throughout life (see also comment 9
w).
have changed a lot of the language in the introduction to shift the focus away from early life to
eriences throughout the life.
response to how comment 5 was addressed by authors: This comment should be addressed more
quately for example with a supplementary table or figure?
have uploaded a supplementary table and cited it in the manuscript lines 184-5.
response to how comment 9 was addressed by authors: The authors do more to focus on the HPA
in discussing their results. In particular in making the link between atypical experiences and
htened cortisol levels and what these mean for later life - here there is work in humans and outside
rimates as well (e.g., mice) that can be accessed.
have added some supporting evidence from humans and rats in the Discussion lines 216-219.
