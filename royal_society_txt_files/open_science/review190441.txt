Comments:
In this work the behavior of Re, W, and Co werestudied using molecular dynamics and ab-initio
calculations.The detailed analyses on energiesof each atom and bonding between atoms were
discussed and compared.The physics were well conducted and the conclusions were consistent in
the manuscript.However, there are some doubts and misunderstandings in the manuscript. This
work could be accepted as a journal in Royal Society Open Science if the authors improve the
current manuscript. The questions and suggestions are as follows:
1. Upon adding Re, W, and Co into the systems, the lattice parameters will change. If the systems
still use the lattice parameters of pure Ni, there will be extra stress introduced into the systems
due to the different solute radius compared with that of Ni atom. The changes in their respective
lattice parameters should be considered. The proper lattice parameters in the simulation would
provide reliable results. Thus, whether the authors used the models with the lattice parameters of
pure Ni or used the models with lattice parameters after adding alloying atoms is unclear and
should be given in the manuscript.
2. There are many different crystallographic planes and cracks in the system, the reason for
adopting the (11¯1)[1¯1 0]crack system in the simulation should be given.
3. When the dislocation passes the W atom in the middle of Figure 8(d), the <U+0394>E_jfor this W atom
is relatively higher and the <U+0394>E_jat this atomic site is not decreased, I think reasonable
explanation is needed.
4. Regarding the details of the manuscript, some careful editing in the manuscript are needed:
(1) The unit “eV” in article should not be presented as italic font and there should be space
between the numerical value and the unit. For example, in the last line of page 4, The “6.32eV”
should be “6.32 eV”, and here the italic font of the unit eV should also be corrected.
(2) In the first line of page 12, the overline of [112] should not be consecutive, and should be [¯1
¯1 ¯2] instead.
(3) There should be a period in the caption of each table in the main article and the
supplementary material.
(4) There shouldn’t have spaces before theexpression “where equation (3.1)” in page 9.

The paper by Wang et al studied and compared the effect of Re, W, and Co on dislocation

that the ability of Re, W, and Co in improving the ductility of the Ni crack system is in the order
W>Re>Co, which is consistent with their previous publications. In this sense, I think the authors
should discuss how their results compare with experiments. I have other comments below.
1. Both (111) and (11-1) are slip planes in Ni. I don’t see the reason why authors ignore the (11-1)

Response to Referees hID: RSOS-190441i
Dear Editor(s) and Reviewers:
Thank you for your kind letter and the reviewers’ comments concerning
our manuscript entitled “Effects of Re, W, and Co on dislocation nucleation
at the crack tip in the gamma phase of Ni-based single crystal superalloys
by atomistic simulation”. (ID: RSOS-190441). The comments are all very
helpful for revising and improving our paper. We have studied the comments
carefully and have given a detailed explanation which we hope will meet with
approval. The responds to the reviewers’ comments and the main corrections
(the modifications are highlighted in the revised manuscript) are as follows:
Comments by Reviewer #1
1. Upon adding Re, W, and Co into the systems, the
lattice parameters will change. If the systems still
use the lattice parameters of pure Ni, there will be
extra stress introduced into the systems due to the
different solute radius compared with that of Ni atom.
The changes in their respective lattice parameters should
be considered. The proper lattice parameters in the
simulation would provide reliable results. Thus, whether
the authors used the models with the lattice parameters of
pure Ni or used the models with lattice parameters after
adding alloying atoms is unclear and should be given in
the manuscript.
Response to Reviewer#1 comment No.1:
After doping with alloying elements, the lattice parameter of the lattice
will change. When building the models, the different lattice constants for the
systems with 1 at. % or 2 at. % X (X=Re, W, or Co) are considered. The
calculated lattice parameters are 3.520, 3.524, 3.527, 3.525, 3.530, 3.519, 3.519
for system without alloying elements and systems with 1at.%Re, 2at.%Re,
1at.%W, 2at.%W, 1at.%Co, and 2at.%Co, respectively. This is consistent
with the result of the previous calculation by Liu et al. [Shu-Lan Liu et al.
RSC Adv. 2015]. According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, the corresponding
description is added in paragraph 3 of section 2 of the revised manuscript:
“The crack systems with alloying...introduced in the following section.” and
in second paragraph of section 3-(d) of the revised manuscript: “The lattice
parameters for...with the previous result.”.
2. There are many different crystallographic planes
and cracks in the system, the reason for adopting the
(11-1)[1-10] crack system in the simulation should be
given.
Response to Reviewer#1 comment No.2:
The crack system (1 1 1)[1 1 0] is chosen because it is experimentally ob-
served that the cracks propagation and dislocation nucleation happen easily
for this crack system. According to the Reviewer’s suggestion the related
description and supportive references are added in the revised manuscript.
Please see the second paragraph of section 2 in the revised manuscript: “This
crack system is chosen...for this crack system”.
3. When the dislocation passes the W atom in the middle
of Figure 8(d), the <U+2206>Ej for this W atom is relatively
higher and the <U+2206>Ej at this atomic site is not decreased,
I think reasonable explanation is needed.
Response to Reviewer#1 comment No.3:
This may be resulted from two alloying elements being too close. The
relatively higher <U+2206>Ej does not change the general trend of most alloying W
atoms decrease the <U+2206>Ej and the increase in the value of <U+2206>Ej is not so large
because the atoms at the dislocation core have a relatively higher background
<U+2206>Ej . This relatively higer ”background” <U+2206>Ej in the dislocation core and
2
the relatively low possibility of two alloying elements being too close (for
the concentration in current study) makes the contribution of the increase in
<U+2206>Ej by special W atoms have little effect on the overall energy decrease of
<U+2206>Eact . According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we added the corresponding
explanation in the second paragraph of section 3-(c) in the revised manuscript:
“We observe that at some...overall energy decrease of <U+2206>Eact ”.
4. Regarding the details of the manuscript, some careful
editing in the manuscript are needed:
(1) The unit ‘‘eV’’ in article should not be presented
as italic font and there should be space between the
numerical value and the unit. For example, in the last
line of page 4, The ‘‘6.32eV’’ should be ‘‘6.32 eV’’,
and here the italic font of the unit eV should also be
corrected.
(2) In the first line of page 12, the overline of [112]
should not be consecutive, and should be [-1 -1 2]
instead.
(3) There should be a period in the caption of each table
in the main article and the supplementary material.
(4) There shouldn’t have spaces before the expression
‘‘where equation (3.1)’’ in page 9.
Response to Reviewer#1 comment No.4 (1):
We are very sorry for our carelessness in expressions and symbols. Accord-
ing to the Reviewer’s suggestion we checked the whole manuscript and make
sure there was a space between the numerical value and the unit. To avoid
similar errors, we checked all the symbols in the manuscript and corrected
the similar expressions.
Response to Reviewer#1 comment No.4 (2):
We consulted the relevant books and references and found that the crys-
tallography directions are indeed written in this form. We checked the whole
manuscript and corrected the relating expressions according to the Reviewer’s
suggestion.
Response to Reviewer#1 comment No.4 (3):
According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we added periods at each caption
of the tables in the revised manuscript and the revised supplementary material.
3
To avoid similar errors, we also checked all the captions of the figures in the
manuscript and added periods at each caption of the figures in the revised
manuscript.
Response to Reviewer#1 comment No.4 (4):
According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, the spaces before the expression
“where equation (3.1)” in page 9 is removed. We also checked other places in
the manuscript to avoid similar errors.

Comments by Reviewer #2
The paper by Wang et al. studied and compared the effect
of Re, W, and Co on dislocation nucleation at the crack
tip in Ni, extending their previous studies for Re in
Ni. The results show that the ability of Re, W, and Co
in improving the ductility of the Ni crack system is in
the order W>Re>Co, which is consistent with their previous
publications. In this sense, I think the authors should
discuss how their results compare with experiments.
Response to Reviewer#2 comment No.0:
Considering the comparison of our simulation results with the experiments.
P. Li et al. [P. Li et al. Int. J. Fatigue, 2014] studied the low-cycle-fatigue
behaviours of the Ni-based single crystal superalloys without (0 wt.%) and
with Re addition (3 wt.%), however the behaviour of dislocation nucleation
from the crack tip is not addressed. Y. B. Xu et al. [Y. B. Xu, R. J. Wang,
and Z. G. Wang, Phys. Stat. Sol. (a), 1994][Z. G. Wang and Y. B. Xu, Defect
and Diffusion Forum, 1997] studied the Ni-based single crystal superalloy
DD8 during deformation by in-situ experiments. Although they observed the
evidence of dislocation emission from the crack tip, the crack deformation
mode for the dislocation emission in their study is mode III and does not
directly support our simulation results. Moreover, their study also did not
elucidate the alloying effects on the dislocation nucleation behaviour at the
crack tip. Until now, the direct experimental result of alloying element effects
on the dislocation nucleation at the crack tip is scarce to our knowledge. Due
to the importance of failure and fracture mechanisms in the materials and the
fact that the direct experimental analyses of alloying effects on dislocation
nucleation from the crack tip related in our study is still lacking, we hope
our simulation results will stimulate the experimental efforts in this field.
According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, the related description is added in the
last paragraph of section 3: “Finally, it should be pointed out ... experimental
efforts in this field.”.
1. Both (111) and (11-1) are slip planes in Ni. I don’t
see the reason why authors ignore the (11-1) plane slip
which does not make sense.
5
Response to Reviewer#2 comment No.1:
This issue can be elucidated from two aspects.
First, the dislocation nucleation will happen in a plane which subjects to
high shear stress. The (1 1 1) plane is coplaner with the crack plane in our
study. Under mode I loading, the slip plane with the highest shear stress
happens at the plane that forms an angle <U+03B8>=70.53<U+25E6> with the crack plane, i.e.
the dislocation nucleation plane is not coplaner (<U+03B8>=0<U+25E6> ) with the crack plane
[James R. Rice, J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 1992]. Thus, if the crack plane lies in
(1 1 1) plane, the dislocation nucleation plane will be in the (1 1 1) plane.
Second, the {1 1 1} slip planes in FCC structure includes 4 sets of octahe-
dral planes, each set of octahedral planes includes two parallel planes. The 4
sets of octahedral planes are (1 1 1), (1 1 1), (1 1 1) and (1 1 1) planes. When
the crack plane lies in either of these 4 planes, the dislocation nucleation and
slip will happen on the plane that forms an angle <U+03B8>=70.53<U+25E6> with the crack
plane under mode I loading.
From the above two aspects, the model with the dislocation nucleating at
(1 1 1) plane from the (1 1 1) crack plane is reasonable.
2. Since the outer region of the simulation model is
fixed, the author should comment on the size effect and
how this fixed layer affects their results.
Response to Reviewer#2 comment No.2:
Our study focused on the comparative study of the effects of Re, W, and Co
on dislocation nucleation behavior at the crack tip, which mainly discussed
the configurations and energetics relating to the saddle state during the
dislocation nucleation process. As can be seen from Fig.5 in the main article,
the dislocation loop near the crack tip is localized in the saddle state. Thus, the
fixed boundary effect on our transition state should be weak and the in-plain
radius R in our model is reasonable from this respect. The fixed boundary
condition should have strong influence on the final state configuration (the
dislocation moves far away from the crack tip) and energetics, which is not our
concern in current study. Regarding the model size along the crack front length,
the activation energy of dislocation nucleation grows almost linearly with the
crack front length in the pure Ni system under the condition KI = 0.64KIc ,
which is shown in Figure 1 in the revised supplementary material. This
result is reasonable as the saddle state dislocation spans the whole crack front
6
length and the dislocation nucleation is expected to be more difficult with
the increase of the dislocation line length. Thus, the current model size is
reasonable and it also makes the simulations computationally feasible in our
study. According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, the related comments on the
size and fixed layer effects are added in the second paragraph of section 3-(b)
in the revised manuscript: “It can also be seen that the dislocation loop ... in
our model is reasonable from this respect.” and in the revised supplementary
material: “The test of the model size ... activation energy of an isolated
dislocation.”. The Figure 1 in the revised supplementary material is also
added as the supporting material.
3. The simulations for each concentration of randomly
doped alloying element are repeated three times. So it is
helpful to provide the standard error for the calculated
Eact in table 1 and Fig.3.
Response to Reviewer#2 comment No.3:
According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, the error bar of the standard error
is added into Fig.3 of the revised manuscript and the values of the standard
errors are added into Table 1 of the revised manuscript.
4. What interpolation method is used for Fig.3?
Response to Reviewer#2 comment No.4:
We are very sorry for the omission of mentioning the interpolation method
in Fig.3. The interpolation method in Fig.3 we use is the cubic-spline
interpolation. According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, the related description
is added in the second paragraph of section 3-(a) in the revised manuscript:
“, in which the cubic-spline interpolation is used.”.
5. Why the larger ratio of surface energy to usf, the
stronger ability of in promoting dislocation nucleation?
Response to Reviewer#2 comment No.5:
The factors that can affect the toughness and/or ductile include dislocation
mobility and crack tip blunting [James R. Rice and Robb Thomson, Philos.
Mag., 1974]. The description of the brittle vs. ductile behaviour should not
7
only consider the effect of cleavage decohesion, but also should include the
dislocation emission process. In terms of the Rice-Thomson approach [James
R. Rice and Robb Thomson, Philos. Mag. 1974, James R. Rice, J Mech Phys
Solids, 1992], the brittle vs. ductile behaviour is based on a comparative
analysis of two competing process: (1) The opening of the crack, and (2) The
dislocation emission at the crack tip.
The resistance to dislocation emission at the crack tip can be measured
with the maximum energy related with the sliding of the atomic planes (<U+03B3>us )
[James R. Rice, J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 1992]. The larger the <U+03B3>us is, the more
difficult the dislocation nucleation at the crack tip.
The cleavage decohesion is related with the magnitude of the surface energy.
The larger the surface energy, the more difficult the cleavage decohesion will
be and the more difficult two new surfaces will form. Either the dislocation
nucleation at the crack tip or cleavage decohesion can release the induced
stress and strain in the system. As mentioned above, the ductile-brittle
response is neither solely the result of dislocation emission nor the solely
result of the cleavage decohesion, but the result of the competition between the
two processes. Thus, the comparative analysis of the two competing processes
can be combined (by adopting the ratio of <U+03B3>s and <U+03B3>us ) to characterize the
ease of the dislocation nucleation.
6. The results suggest that doping actually promoting
dislocation. Can the author comment on how this
correlates with solid solute strengthening effect?
Response to Reviewer#2 comment No.6:
The possible mechanisms for solid solution strengthening are: (1) The
ability of the alloying effects in decreasing the diffusivity and the stacking
fault energy [Ernst Fleischmann et al. Acta Mater. 2015]. (2). The combined
effect of the solid solution strengthener in partitioning in the <U+03B3> phase and the
strong interaction of solid solution strengthener with the dislocation in the <U+03B3>
phase and retard the dislocation motion [M. Pro¨bstle et al. Mater. Sci. Eng.
A, 2016][Feng-Hua Liu and Chong-Yu Wang, RSC Adv. 2017]. (3) Other
mechanisms may also include the Cottrell atomosphere of alloying elements
in pinning the dislocations etc.
The solid solution strengthener may induce the strengthening effect to
the alloys by the above possible mechanisms, which mainly lies in the effects
8
of alloying elements in decreasing the diffusivity, stacking fault energy and
retarding dislocation motions etc.
From the microscopic view, the two categories (solid solution strengthening
and the dislocation nucleation at the crack tip) have different mechanisms in
influencing the mechanical properties of the material. From the macroscopic
view, they have some connections. The “strengthening” of the material does
not necessarily mean the material is more “brittle”.
The final rupture of the material is usually displayed with the cracks.
The ductile vs. brittle behaviour of the material can be explained by the
competition between the dislocation nucleation and cleavage in the alloys.
The alloying elements Re, W, and Co can promote the dislocation nucleation
against the cleavage process, which can suppress the extension and propagation
of the crack. Thus, the ability of resisting the cleavage failure is improved. It is
desired for material to have reasonable ductility to prevent the components and
structures from catastrophic failure during service. This is not contradictory
to the solute solution strengthening effect, as the resistance to cleavage failure
and the solute solution strengthening can both be beneficial to the material.

Other modifications made to the revised manuscript:
1. In our revised manuscript, the use of more factual data and arguments
are added to enhance the article rigor and persuasiveness. To this end,
we give another simulation result with a different doping. The results
and conclusions of the article are not affected by the factual data added.
The data is added as Table 4 in the revised supplementary material
and the corresponding arguments and descriptions are added in the
second paragraph of section 3-(a) in the revised manuscript: “...are
repeated four times” and “(We also observe the phenomena ... random
fluctuation of atoms.)”. The Table1, Figure 3, Figure 13, and Figure 14
are updated at the same time. The results are reasonable and consistent
with our conclusion.
2. All the text “Fig.” in the article are modified to “Figure” in the revised
manuscript.
3. We added spaces between the texts and the left parentheses “(” in the
revised manuscript. For example, “X(X=Re, W, or Co)” is modified to
“ X (X=Re, W, or Co)”.
4. An author Tao Yu has been added in our article, who contributed
to the discussion, editing the manuscript and improvements of the
article. The content of the section “Authors’ Contributions” is modified
as: “Chongyu Wang and Tao Yu provided discussions and edited the
manuscript.”
5. The email address for the author Chongyu Wang is corrected from
cywang@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn to cywang@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn.
6. The grant number is modified as “The work was supported by the
National Key R&D Program of China (Grants No.2017YFB0701501).”
7. In the “References” section, we added references which is labeled with
the reference numbers of 34, 35, and 36.
8. In the supplementary material, the Figure 1, Table 4 and the corre-
sponding description are added.
9. Other grammatical and spelling mistakes (including those pointed out
by the Reviewers) are corrected and highlighted (red colored texts) in
the main article.
