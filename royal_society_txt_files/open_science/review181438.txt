1. Why has the manuscript been uploaded twice?
2. Throughout the manuscript, no detailed information was provided regarding the experimental
of strains and the permeability. Simply, they were mentioned rather than any proper information.
Authors are advised to add detailed information.
3. No chemical analysis of the studied coal was included in the manuscript.
4. For the measurement of permeability, CO2 was utilized. Authors might be aware of the
swelling nature of coal during the interaction with the carbon dioxide. So, while measuring the
permeability was the swelling factor was considered.
5. What can be the possible cause for the increase in the permeability of the coal after a certain
value of the intermediate stress?
6. Can the PR of the coal be up to 0.5? Please verify with the calculations.

The manuscript presented an interesting investigation on permeability and deformation
properties of coals containing bedding planes under true triaxial stress conditions. The
manuscript seems organized well. The approach taken and result are interesting and useful for
3
potential readers. Specific comments for revision are as follows,
(1) In abstract, the language is confused and the logic is not clear, so it needs to be completely
revised.
(2) Why not consider the effective stress effect?
(3) How did you make sure that flow regime was dominated by Darcy flow during experiment?
(4) For the rigid loading, the end effect inevitably exist, which can affect the deformation
measurement results of the specimen. What methods did you use to reduce the end friction
effect?
(5) How did you measure sample deformation in each direction, especially for volumetric strain?
(6) Please provide in-situ stress conditions in the operation field where you took this specimen
from?
(7) Explain why the gas pressure in this paper is 3 MPa?
(8) I recommended the author delete the figure about (e1-e2) and (e2-e3) in Fig. 12.
(9) Please indicate the beddings in the coal specimen.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
It is very confused regarding the primary objective of the study. Do the authors wanna figure out
the role of bedding planes in fluid flow in coal reservoirs? The main problem with the study is
that it lacks novelty. Some detailed comments are as follows:
1. Line 39: this is a completely incorrect statement. Lots of studies have proved that bedding
planes of coal have little influence on coal permeability.
2. In Introduction, more than 90% of the content is about sandstone and shale. The goal of the
study is to investigate the mechanical behavior and coal permeability, so the authors should pay
their attention to coal. Considering the significant difference in reservoir structure between coal
and other reservoir rocks, the studies on other rocks and the corresponding findings cannot be
simply embezzled to coal.
3. How many specimens were prepared and tested?
4
4. Section 2.3, the experimental process is far from clear. What is the purpose for each step? More
importantly, what kind of gas was used for testing? Different conclusions can be drawn when
using different test gases.
5. Line 159-160: it is impossible to get the conclusion from Fig. 5.
6. In Conclusion: "the strain variation was largest, regardless of loading or unloading in the
direction vertical to bedding". This conclusion is incorrect when it comes to coal if using non-
sorptive gas as the test gas.
7. No new findings are reported in this study.

Associate Editor's comments:
Thank you for the submission. We have now received three reports on your paper. Each reviewer
has matters they would like to see addressed before the paper may be considered for publication.
In particular, you will note one of the reviewers questions the degree of novelty your work
represents. Royal Society Open Science requires manuscripts to represent a meaningful
contribution to the literature -- at present, it is not clear how your paper fulfills this criterion.
Please address the concerns of the reviews, and this last point in particular. If your revision does
not persuade the referee that your paper represents an advance on existing knowledge, we regret
it will not be possible to consider the paper further for publication. Good luck and we look
forward to receiving your response.

Manuscript Number: RSOS-181438
Paper Title: Influence of Principal Stress Effect on Deformation and Permeability of Coal
Containing beddings under True Triaxial Stress Conditions
Authors: Jiahui Dai, Chao Liu, Minghui Li and Zhenlong Song
Dear editors and reviewers,
Special thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their careful reviews and valuable
comments. We have carefully checked these comments and made necessary corrections and
modifications. We tried our best to improve the manuscript.
Improvements and clarifications have been made in the current manuscript. These
changes are marked by red words. English grammar errors and inaccurate expressions are
modified and rephrased.
We appreciate for the editors and reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the
manuscript after the corrections can satisfy the requirements for publication. Once again, thank
you very much for your comments and suggestions.
Point-by-point Responses to the reviewers’ comments
Reviewer #1:
Comment 1: Why has the manuscript been uploaded twice?
Response:
Thanks for the comment. We are very sorry for it. Since we are the first to the Journal:
Royal Society Open Science, we are not familiar with the submission system. It's also
related to our carelessness. If we have the opportunity to submit new manuscripts to the
journal, we will strictly comply with the requirements of the submission system and avoid
such mistakes.
Comment 2: Throughout the manuscript, no detailed information was provided
regarding the experimental of strains and the permeability. Simply, they were mentioned
rather than any proper information. Authors are advised to add detailed information.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. The coals extracted from the well were processed to get the
cube specimens, and then we started the experiment. The experimental steps are as follows:
(1) Place the specimen on the loading plate, and then put on a heat-shrinkable tube,
which should cover the sealing washer of the loading plate (Fig. R1). The heat-shrinkable
tube is tightly attached to the surface of the specimen with a hot air gun. Then the heat-
shrinkable tube is tightly fastened at the sealing washer to prevent air leakage during the
experiment.
(2) The specimen is fed into the loading cell, and the LVDT is installed and connected.
The force of the true triaxial control system is cleared and the loading plate is moved
slowly towards the specimen by displacement control. Meanwhile, the indicator changes
of the LVDT displayed on the system are observed. When the system shows that the force
of the six loading plates is 0. 5 kN to 2. 5 kN (indicating that the loading plate has been in
contact with the specimen) and the LVDT is within -1 mm ~ +1mm (the range of LVDT is
-5 mm ~ +5mm), the installation of the LVDT is feasible. Otherwise, the LVDT will be
readjusted (Measurements of the specimen’s deformation are made independently along
each principal stress axis using the linear variable displacement transducers as shown in
Fig. R2).
(3) Seal the loading cell and fill it with hydraulic oil. When it is full, close the intake
valve. The hydraulic oil was pressurized to 5 MPa by the servo valve (according to the
principle of force and reaction force, the stress designed by the experiment is
correspondingly reduced by 5 MPa) and the oil pressure should be greater than the gas
pressure in the experiment to prevent the heat-shrinkable tube from bursting. Then enter
the gas and adjust the pressure valve to 3 MPa.
(4) The experiment is carried out according to the designed stress path. When the
stress reaches each stress point, the change of the LVDT and the flow rate of the flowmeter
are observed. The next step can only be taken after the displacement and flow are stable.

In the experiment, what we are most concerned about is the change of LVDT. The
strain can be obtained by the displacement data recorded by the data acquisition system,
which is the basis of the mechanical analysis.
We applied steady state method to measure permeability. For steady state gas flow
measurements, the inlet pressure was kept constant while the gas on the outlet side was at
atmospheric pressure (Pout=0.1 MPa). The inlet and outlet pressure data were recorded in
short intervals (1.2 s for the control and data acquisition system of the multifunctional true
triaxial geophysical apparatus) using the pressure transducers. The gas flow rate at the
outlet side was monitored using a mass flow meter with the precision of 1mL/min. To start
a steady state measurement, the inlet pressure was adjusted to a desired pressure (it is 3
MPa in the paper) using the pressure regulator connected to the gas cylinder. Once the
steady state flow conditions were reached, the flow rates were recorded and a higher stress
was applied in accordance with the stress path. Then the permeability was calculated by
Darcy’s law.
Comment 3: No chemical analysis of the studied coal was included in the
manuscript.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. Hu et al. (2018) concluded that in situ stresses have a direct
impact on the potential for fracture shear failure, the evolution of stress-dependent
aperture and the corresponding evolution of permeability [1]. Therefore, in the paper, the
purpose of the research is to investigate the deformation mechanism of the coal and gas
migration in various directions under the effect of bedding. For studied coal, we only
conducted proximate analysis as shown in Table R1.

Comment 4: For the measurement of permeability, CO2 was utilized. Authors might
be aware of the swelling nature of coal during the interaction with the carbon dioxide. So,
while measuring the permeability was the swelling factor was considered.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. It is true that CO2 adsorption will cause the coal matrix
swelling. Hence, the total strain and permeability of the coal are affected by CO2
adsorption. However, it is very difficult to figure out the actual effects of CO2 adsorption
on the deformation and permeability quantitatively. Besides, in our experiments, the gas
pressure was constant (3 MPa). During the whole permeability measurements, the inlet
pressure kept at 3 MPa and the outlet pressure kept at 0.1 MPa. As the gas pressure kept
constant, the effects of CO2 adsorption on the deformation and permeability kept constant
as well. Therefore, the measured strain and permeability were under comprehensive
conditions, which can reflect the real field situations. Thank you again for the comment.
Comment 5: What can be the possible cause for the increase in the permeability of
the coal after a certain value of the intermediate stress?
Response:
Thanks for the comment. Rock strength firstly increases and subsequently decreases
with the increase of intermediate principal stress [2]. When the intermediate principal
stress increases to the critical value, the resistance to deformation of coals is weakened,
which makes the pores and cracks in coal body tend to open from the original closed state,
and finally show an increase in permeability.

Comment 6: Can the PR of the coal be up to 0.5? Please verify with the calculations.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. In this paper, we conducted triaxial compression
experiments, not uniaxial compression. Therefore, it is more appropriate to refer to µ as
the lateral expansion coefficient. Substituting the true triaxial experimental data into Eqs.
(13) and (14) of original manuscript, we obtain the variation of the lateral expansion
coefficient versus the intermediate principal stress. Under conventional triaxial
compression experiments, Figure (18) in original manuscript is derived from the following
Eqs. :
<U+F06D> B<U+F073> 1 <U+F073> 3 / <U+F073> 3 2B 1 <U+F073>1 (R1)
B <U+F065> 3 / <U+F065>1 (R2)
The Poisson's ratio in the full text is changed to the lateral expansion coefficient.
Reviewer #2:
Comment 1: In abstract, the language is confused and the logic is not clear, so it
needs to be completely revised.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the abstract is
modified as follows: In-situ stress is generally an anisotropic/true triaxial stress (s1<U+FE65>s2<U+FE65>
s3). Bedding weaken the continuity and integrity of coal. It is critical to understand the
mechanical behavior and gas migration of coal under true triaxial stress conditions. We
performed experiments of cubic coal samples to investigate the permeability evolution and
mechanical behavior of coal under true triaxial stress conditions by using newly developed
true triaxial geophysical (TTG) apparatus. We analyzed the effect of principal stresses on
deformation and permeability characteristics of coal containing bedding planes. The
results show that volumetric strain, stress states and bedding directions determine the
permeability comprehensively. The variable quantity of strain was the largest in the
direction normal to the bedding plane. The expansion or compression degree were
characterized by the difference between the major and minor principal strain (e1-e3).
Essentially, this represents the difficulty degree with regard to coal being compressed at
the initial stress state, and the deformation degree in e1 and e3 direction. The variation of
(e1-e3) was consistent to that of permeability. Under an identical true triaxial stress
condition, permeability was smaller when larger stress was applied in the direction normal
to the bedding plane. Additionally, stress level in the direction parallel to the bedding
planes and the directions between stresses in the direction paralleling to the bedding
planes and the flow direction also affect the permeability and strain. By solving lateral
expansion coefficient, coal also exhibited anisotropic properties.
Comment 2: Why not consider the effective stress effect?
Response:
Thank you for this comment. In our experiments, the gas pressure was constant (3
MPa). During the whole permeability measurements, the inlet pressure kept at 3 MPa and
the outlet pressure kept at 0.1 MPa. As the gas pressure kept constant, the variations of
total stress and effective stress were the same. The overall trends of the curves plotting in
terms of total stress and effective stress are the same. Therefore, we used total stress in the
manuscript.
Comment 3: How did you make sure that flow regime was dominated by Darcy
flow during experiment?
Response:
Thanks for the comment. Fracture permeability is generally governed by Darcy’s law
[1, 2, 3]. Zhang and Wang also believed that the Darcy flow works within macropores (pore
width>50 nm) and fractures [4]. Wu et al. concluded that the flow rate, q, of 8.33×10-7 m3/s
is sufficiently low to achieve the steady-state flow [5]. The magnitude of flow rate under
true triaxial conditions we measured is also between 10-6 and 10-7, which indicates that the
gas flow through the coal body is in steady-state. The Darcy’s flow equation has been
widely used in the field to estimate fluid permeability through porous media under
steady-state flow conditions [6].
In addition, we have measured the coal flow rate, q, under different stresses and gas
pressures. As shown in Fig. R3, the flow rate and gas pressure are linearly fitted with a
correlation coefficient, R2 of 0.9981 and 0.9987. It also proves that we use the rationality of
Darcy's law equation.

Comment 4: For the rigid loading, the end effect inevitably exist, which can affect
the deformation measurement results of the specimen. What methods did you use to
reduce the end friction effect?
Response:
Thanks for the comment. The mismatch in the elastic parameters (Young's modulus
and Poisson's ratio) between the coal specimen and the metal platens of Multi-functional
true triaxial geophysical apparatus produces an interface friction when loaded in six
direnctions, which results in a non-uniform stress distribution at the end of the specimen.
Based on the rigid loading mode, this situation is inevitable, and we call it the end friction
effect [7]. Lubrication is an effective method to decrease the friction between metal loading-
platens and specimen faces by applying anti-friction agent. In this paper, the first step is
to wrap the coal specimen with a heat-shrinkable tube, and then use a heat air gun to
tighten the heat-shrinkable tube to the coal specimen. Finally, daub lithium grease evenly
on four horizontal loading platens. Due to ventilation for permeability experiment, no
lubricant is applied to the vertical surface.

Comment 5: How did you measure sample deformation in each direction,
especially for volumetric strain?
Response:
Thanks for the comment. The coals extracted from the well were processed to get the
cube specimens, and then we started the experiment. The experimental steps are as follows:
(1) Place the specimen on the loading plate, and then put on a heat-shrinkable tube,
which should cover the sealing washer of the loading plate (Fig. R1). The heat-shrinkable
tube is tightly attached to the surface of the specimen with a hot air gun. Then the heat-
shrinkable tube is tightly fastened at the sealing washer to prevent air leakage during the
experiment.
(2) The specimen is fed into the loading cell, and the LVDT is installed and connected.
The force of the true triaxial control system is cleared and the loading plate is moved
slowly towards the specimen by displacement control. Meanwhile, the indicator changes
of the LVDT displayed on the system are observed. When the system shows that the force
of the six loading plates is 0. 5 kN to 2. 5 kN (indicating that the loading plate has been in
contact with the specimen) and the LVDT is within -1 mm ~ +1mm (the range of LVDT is
-5 mm ~ +5mm), the installation of the LVDT is feasible. Otherwise, the LVDT will be
readjusted (Measurements of the specimen’s deformation are made independently along
each principal stress axis using the linear variable displacement transducers as shown in
Fig. R2).
(3) Seal the loading cell and fill it with hydraulic oil. When it is full, close the intake
valve. The hydraulic oil was pressurized to 5 MPa by the servo valve (according to the
principle of force and reaction force, the stress designed by the experiment is
correspondingly reduced by 5 MPa) and the oil pressure should be greater than the gas
pressure in the experiment to prevent the heat-shrinkable tube from bursting. Then enter
the gas and adjust the pressure valve to 3 MPa.
(4) The experiment is carried out according to the designed stress path. When the
stress reaches each stress point, the change of the LVDT and the flow rate of the flowmeter
are observed. The next step can only be taken after the displacement and flow are stable.
Finally, the volumetric strain eV is obtained according to the volumetric strain
expression eV=e1+e2+e3.
Comment 6: Please provide in-situ stress conditions in the operation field where
you took this specimen from?

2461 of outburst coal seam C1 is shown in Table R2.

Comment 7: Explain why the gas pressure in this paper is 3 MPa?
Response:
Thanks for the comment. Based on the gas pressure of coal seam between 1.57 and 3.2
MPa, the experimental gas pressure was set to 3 MPa.

Reviewer #3:
Comment 1: Line 39: this is a completely incorrect statement. Lots of studies have
proved that bedding planes of coal have little influence on coal permeability.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. Coal cleats are of two types: face cleats and butt cleat, which
are often normal to the bedding plane and may be perpendicular to each other [1, 2, 3].
Fordsham and Gayer concluded that bedding plane slipping fractures are also tectonically
induced and are widespread in coal seams, commonly associated with cleat [4]. It is well
known that the coal permeability decrease significantly with cleat closure [5]. However, a
lot of researches have been done on the effect of bedding on permeability and mechanical
properties. The permeability varies extensively between di fferent orientations, especially
in the vertical and parallel directions of coal bedding [3, 6, 7]. Koenig et al. conducted
permeability experiments on coals obtained from the Warrior Basin in the United States.
The permeability ratio of different bedding directions reached a maximum of 17 : 1 [6].
Pomeroy et al. used water for the seepage test and found that when the confining pressure
was perpendicular to the bedding plane, the permeability changed significantly [8]. Liu et
al. and Li et al. carried out permeability tests under different bedding and joint conditions.
They pointed out that the bedding and joint structure had an important influence on the
permeability and deformation [7, 9]. Pan et al. took coal with different bedding directions
as the research object, and studied the law of the permeability evolution during the loading
process. It was concluded that drilling across bedding planes for gas extraction achieved
better effects, at last reduce gas release and gas disasters [10]. Liang et al. conducted
uniaxial compression tests on salt rock and coal specimens to obtain relevant basic
mechanical parameters and strength characteristics of salt rock and coal in different
bedding directions [11]. Therefore, the understanding of the contribution of bedding on
seepage and deformation properties of coals containing beddings is both important and
necessary.

Comment 2: In Introduction, more than 90% of the content is about sandstone and
shale. The goal of the study is to investigate the mechanical behavior and coal permeability,
so the authors should pay their attention to coal. Considering the significant difference in
reservoir structure between coal and other reservoir rocks, the studies on other rocks and
the corresponding findings cannot be simply embezzled to coal.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. We have added some literatures about the influence of
bedding in coals on deformation and permeability evolutions, and deleted some literatures
which are not relevant to the subject. The modified introduction are written in revised
manuscript by red words.
Comment 3: How many specimens were prepared and tested?
Response:
Thank you for this comment. We performed the same experiments using two
specimens. The results show similar deformation behaviors and permeability evolutions
of the specimen.
Comment 4: Section 2.3, the experimental process is far from clear. What is the
purpose for each step? More importantly, what kind of gas was used for testing? Different
conclusions can be drawn when using different test gases.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. The experimental process was as following
The coals extracted from the well were processed to get the cube specimens, and then
we started the experiment. The experimental steps are as follows:
(1) Place the specimen on the loading plate, and then put on a heat-shrinkable tube,
which should cover the sealing washer of the loading plate (Fig. R1). The heat-shrinkable
tube is tightly attached to the surface of the specimen with a hot air gun. Then the heat-
shrinkable tube is tightly fastened at the sealing washer to prevent air leakage during the
experiment.
(2) The specimen is fed into the loading cell, and the LVDT is installed and connected.
The force of the true triaxial control system is cleared and the loading plate is moved
slowly towards the specimen by displacement control. Meanwhile, the indicator changes
of the LVDT displayed on the system are observed. When the system shows that the force
of the six loading plates is 0. 5 kN to 2. 5 kN (indicating that the loading plate has been in
contact with the specimen) and the LVDT is within -1 mm ~ +1mm (the range of LVDT is
-5 mm ~ +5mm), the installation of the LVDT is feasible. Otherwise, the LVDT will be
readjusted (Measurements of the specimen’s deformation are made independently along
each principal stress axis using the linear variable displacement transducers as shown in
Fig. R2).
(3) Seal the loading cell and fill it with hydraulic oil. When it is full, close the intake
valve. The hydraulic oil was pressurized to 5 MPa by the servo valve (according to the
principle of force and reaction force, the stress designed by the experiment is
correspondingly reduced by 5 MPa) and the oil pressure should be greater than the gas
pressure in the experiment to prevent the heat-shrinkable tube from bursting. Then enter
the gas and adjust the pressure valve to 3 MPa.
(4) The experiment is carried out according to the designed stress path. When the
stress reaches each stress point, the change of the LVDT and the flow rate of the flowmeter
are observed. The next step can only be taken after the displacement and flow are stable.
We conducted the experimental scheme of loading and unloading the intermediate
principal stress while fixing the major and minor principal stresses by considering the
relative positions of principal stress and bedding direction. The differences among the
permeability evolution and deformation properties in all directions were discussed to
investigate the bedding effect. This was the purpose of each step.
The gas environment was CO2 with 3 MPa in the experiment.
Comment 5: Line 159-160: it is impossible to get the conclusion from Fig. 5.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. According to the counting rule of the multi-functional true
triaxial geophysical apparatus system, the strain increases when the specimen is
compressed in one direction, and decreases when it expands. Figure 5 in original
manuscript shows the variation of eV and k during the entire experimental process. eV and
k basically comply to the following rules: with the increase of eV, a decrease in k induced
by the compaction and closure of micro-porosities and microcracks occurred, and vice
versa. Similarly, Yin et al. also obtained similar conclusions in the conventional triaxial test
[12].

Comment 6: In Conclusion: "the strain variation was largest, regardless of loading
or unloading in the direction vertical to bedding". This conclusion is incorrect when it
comes to coal if using non-sorptive gas as the test gas.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. We have revised this conclusion to ‘The conclusion ‘the
strain variation was largest of coal saturating CO2 under applied stress and keeping gas
pressure unchanged , regardless of loading or unloading in the direction vertical to
bedding’.
Comment 7: No new findings are reported in this study.
Response:
Thanks for the comment. Coal is a kind of sedimentary rock with obvious beddings
[13], especially for normal coals [14]. The existence of beddings weaken the continuity
and integrity of coal and makes it heterogeneity [15, 16, 17]. With respect to underground
reservoirs, the in situ stress is generally anisotropic (s1>s2>s3), and the hydrostatic stress
and triaxial stress (i.e. varying confining stress) do not replicate the true in situ stress [18,
19, 20, 21]. Therefore, we performed experiments of cubic coal samples to investigate the
permeability evolution and mechanical behavior of coal under true triaxial stress
conditions by using newly developed true triaxial geophysical (TTG) apparatus.
The results show that volumetric strain, stress states and bedding directions
determine the permeability comprehensively. The variable quantity of strain was the
largest in the direction normal to the bedding plane. The expansion or compression degree
were characterized by the difference between the major and minor principal strain (e1-e3).
Essentially, this represents the difficulty degree with regard to coal being compressed at
the initial stress state and the deformation degree in e1 and e3 direction. Under an identical
true triaxial stress condition, permeability was smaller when larger stress was applied in
the direction normal to the bedding plane. Additionally, stress level in the direction
parallel to the bedding planes and the directions between stresses in the direction
paralleling to the bedding planes and the flow direction also affect the permeability and
strain.
This study can more realistically reflect the permeability and deformation evolutions
of coals containing bedding under true triaxial conditions.
