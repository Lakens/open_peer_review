This manuscript investigates several possible structures of “Novichok” agents and attempts to
evaluate the possible mechanisms of their toxicity. It provides some computational data for these
structures in regard to their NPA charges and reaction thermodynamics with serine. However
this report suffers from several intrinsic problems (as shown below), and therefore it should be
rejected in the current form.
1. For a computational study, reaction kinetics can not be simply inferred based on the positive
charge on a certain atom. At least a reaction path, including the energy barrier and transition
state(s) should be investigated and provided.
2. 6-311++G** basis set is not sufficient for free energy calculation. Larger basis set should have
been used.
3. The Gibbs Freee Energy change for A230, A232 and A234 are all very close (Table 1, within 1
kcal/mol), thus it is questionable to conclude that reaction with A234 is the most
thermodynamically favored; such a conclusion might easily be proven wrong if larger basis sets
or more realistic water models (rather than a continuum) are used.

General Comments
The manuscript reported on a theoretical study on the toxicity of “Novichok” agent candidates.
The authors have done excellent work and this is the first theoretical study on the subject.
However, a major revision is necessary before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.
Specific comments
The authors must validate the theory used in the computation. Firstly, they should validate the
DFT functionals and basis sets used in this study with other functionals and basis set. There
should be reproducible results close to the experimental bond length, bond angle and dihedral
angles of similar systems.

Theoretical study on the toxicity of “Novichok” agent candidates
General comments
The authors have improved the manuscript substantially. However, they have not addressed
some major concerns on the theoretical accuracy of the DFT functionals and basis sets used in this
work. The discussion is too shallow and not detailed enough. More work needs to be conducted
to ensure accuracy of the results and also the theoretical details and the discussion should be
expanded. I will recommend major revision to enhance this work.
Specific comments
1. The authors stated: All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian16W software package
[19]. In reference [19], in the list of references, the author used Gaussian 09 documentation while
in the manuscript they wrote Gaussian 16W. Kindly clarify.
2. The authors must validate the theory used in the computation. Firstly, they should validate the
DFT functionals and basis sets used in this study with other functionals and basis set. They
should use a similar structural system to compute the bond length, bond angle and dihedral

should then select the best functional and basis set after this computation for further theoretical
calculation. This will validate the level of DFT theory used.
3. In the theoretical methods there is no mentioned of the accuracy of the computation such as the
convergence criteria- Energy, Force and displacements. Also there is no mentioned of whether
frequency calculations were conducted in order to determine if the molecules were at a minimum
in the potential energy surface. All these procedures must be reported for the benefit of readers.

nhong Jeong, Junwon Choi
r Editor, Dr. Laura Smith
ong with my coauthor, would like to re-submit the attached research article entitled “Theoretical study
he toxicity of “Novichok” agent candidates” for publication in highly-regarded Royal Society Open
nce. The manuscript ID is RSOS-190414.
manuscript has been carefully rechecked and appropriate changes have been made in accordance with
reviewers’ suggestions after additional extensive quantum calculations. The responses to their
ments are attached herewith.

ment 1: For a computational study, reaction kinetics can not be simply inferred based on the positive
ge on a certain atom. At least a reaction path, including the energy barrier and transition state(s)
ld be investigated and provided.
ponse: We would like to thank the reviewer for this valuable and reasonable comment. We agree with
referee that the reaction kinetic is not simple to derive from the positive charge of phosphorus. And
stigating energy barrier and transition states would be the good way of estimating the reaction kinetic.
ever, we did not consider doing those expensive calculations because charge on the central
sphorus atom is considered as the reactivity descriptor, which can be calculated with reliable method
O) with efficient method. Therefore, we added the comments with some citations in the manuscript as
wing;
ough extensive structural and energy calculations on the transition state of each reaction pathway
ld be another way of estimating the kinetic parameters, as indicated in several other reports23,24,
ge on the central phosphorus atom is used for evaluating the reactivity of the nerve agent.

J. R. Cox and O. B. Ramsay, Chem. Rev., 1964, 64, 317–352.
ment 2: 6-311++G** basis set is not sufficient for free energy calculation. Larger basis set should
e been used.
1
sponse: We would like to thank the reviewer for this valuable and reasonable comment. We agree
the referee that a larger basis set and appropriate DFT functional would providebe provide more
ble for the estimation of the free energy estimationprediction. We used B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level
heory since several research papersrecent papersresearchers have recently used the same level of
ry for the estimation ofing many reliable properties including the energies. However, we agree with
reviewer’s comment;, therefore, we performed additionally calculationsed with a larger basis set and
tional , B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) and M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory and compared the
lts to try to provide better insights on the real data.
ment 3: The Gibbs Freee Energy change for A230, A232 and A234 are all very close (Table 1,
in 1 kcal/mol), thus it is questionable to conclude that reaction with A234 is the most
modynamically favored; such a conclusion might easily be proven wrong if larger basis sets or more
stic water models (rather than a continuum) are used.
sponse: We are grateful to the reviewer for raising this pertinent point. The energy values are very
e; hence, we have additionally described in the discussion. As we noted in the previous response, we
ormed additional calculations with more expensive methods and interestingly, the +/- sign was found
e different at different levels of the theory., Bbut the thermodynamic favorability is still consistent.
refore, we have included more discussions on the results of this calculation. In terms of the water
el, the first shell water coordination with the continuum model would be a better method as the
ewer pointed out; however, as the reviewer understands, the way the first shell coordinates and the
ntations of the coordinating molecules in different structures are all largely related to the energy,
ch would result in the worst comparison of the data.
the B3LYP2 (B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)) level of calculations, there are no negative <U+0394>G values, and
negative values of <U+0394>G are obtained with the M06-2X2 (B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)) level of theory.
se series of theoretical calculations do not provide its spontaneity in the reactivity, however, A234 has
owest <U+0394>G value among all studied structures.

ment : The authors must validate the theory used in the computation. Firstly, they should validate the
functionals and basis sets used in this study with other functionals and basis set. There should be
oducible results close to the experimental bond length, bond angle and dihedral angles of similar
ems.

sponse: We are grateful to the reviewer for raising this pertinent point comment. We used B3LYP/6-
++G(d,p) level of theory since several recent articles have used report the papers used of the same
l of theory for estimating many reliable properties including the structures. However, we agree with
reviewer’s comment, and therefore, we carried out additionally calculationsed with a larger basis set
functional, B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) and M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory and compared
results so as to try to provide better insights on the real data. Thanks to the reviewer’s comment,
er comparison of the results with those obtained with higher levels of calculations, we could
irmed our conclusions with a higher precision. We appreciate the reviewer’s valuable comment.

ies and the following reported two studies. Novelty and benefits of current study are the main

sponse: We are grateful for the reviewer’s valuable suggestion. After the careful investigation of these
great papers, we have now included more discussions on the novelty and benefits of our new study
appropriate citations. We emphasize our study by discussing the novelties of the first theoretical
y on the reactivity of Novichok candidates and propose new types of aging mechanisms. In terms of
efits, we emphasize the merits of theoretical studies of studying toxic and dangerous materials
retically before carrying out experiments. Moreover, more expensive calculations with comparison
ld provide more insights for researchers who develop antidotes to overcome the toxicity of Novichok
ts for a peaceful world in the future. We have included several comments in the manuscript,
uding the following ones:
ong some recently proposed organophosphate structures of Novichok agents17,18, in this study, we
sed only on the chemical structures of A230, A232, and A234 proposed by Hoenig and Ellison
use their aging, which is known to be the loss of one of the groups bound to the phosphorus atom,
r inhibiting acetylcholinesterase seems to be extremely faster than that of the Mirzayanov structure
their secondary reaction is possible, which we refer to as a new type of aging mechanism (see the SI
he structure of A234 proposed by Mirzayanov)

hough theoretical studies on only acetylcholine esterase inhibition do not explain all the toxic effects
he nerve agents, the main plausible reason for their toxicity is their rendering the acetylcholinesterase
tive and thus causing neurotoxicity. Moreover, detoxification methods for developing remedies are
sed on the activation of acetylcholine esterase. Significantly, theoretical studies, which can be
ormed without having to encounter dangerous situations in dealing with such lethal materials, can
d valuable and reliable data that can useful in practical experimental studies and contribute to the
dening of the scope of the knowledge.

The authors stated: All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian16W software
kage [19]. In reference [19], in the list of references, the author used Gaussian 09
umentation while in the manuscript they wrote Gaussian 16W. Kindly clarify.
would like to thank the reviewer for this accurate and valuable comment. We corrected it.
The authors must validate the theory used in the computation. Firstly, they should validate
DFT functionals and basis sets used in this study with other functionals and basis set. They
uld use a similar structural system to compute the bond length, bond angle and dihedral
les and compare the computations to the experimental values for the same structure. They
uld then select the best functional and basis set after this computation for further theoretical
ulation. This will validate the level of DFT theory used.
would like to thank the reviewer for this valuable and reasonable comment. We agree with the referee
evaluating the level of theory is important in the theoretical study. To our best knowledge, it is
ossible to adopt the bond length information of the nerve agent that we investigated here. Therefore,
compared the theoretical IR spectra data with experimental data for GA, GB, GD, and VX. The
ing factor depends on its level of theory; therefore, R-squared values could be used to evaluate the
hod for choosing reliable level of theory in the theoretical studies. We additionally calculated IR
ches of GA, GB, GD, and VX in gas phase with three levels of theory and compared with reported
erimental IR data.

se analysis showed that the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p), and M06-2X/6-
++G(2d,2p) level of theory showed good agreement on the frequency calculations with a good R-
red value, and it is also supported by the other publication, which calculated for various nerve agents
its simulants at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. Therefore, we added the comments in the
uscript as following with sufficient supporting information in ESM;
dditionally, it needs to evaluate the level of theory used in this calculation study due to the lack of
ble theoretical information over the studied structures. Therefore, we assessed the quality of the levels
eory which were implemented. Due to the lack of structural information of nerve agents including bond
ths, we compared the theoretical IR spectra data with experimental data. Because the scaling factor
nds on its level of theory, R-squared values were compared for assessing the level of theories.
restingly, B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p), and M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) levels of
ry showed good agreement on the frequency calculations with high R-squared values (0.9925, 0.9942,
0.9826, respectively) along with small scaling factor (see ESM for detailed information). Although
-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory showed the least correlation between theory and experiment, it is
idered as the more expensive and accurate than any other levels in terms of non-covalent interactions.
hermore, calculated frequency of P=O bond stretch, which is the most important functional group in this
y, showed a good match between calculated result and experimental result for all levels of theory. Based
hese results, we concluded that all calculation levels could be suitable to be applied in this study.
In the theoretical methods there is no mentioned of the accuracy of the computation such
he convergence criteria- Energy, Force and displacements. Also there is no mentioned of
ther frequency calculations were conducted in order to determine if the molecules were at a
imum in the potential energy surface. All these procedures must be reported for the benefit
eaders.
are grateful for the reviewer’s valuable suggestion. We added more detailed information in the
uscript on calculation procedures as follows;
quadratically convergent SCF procedure was used, and the symmetry was turned off by external
est in order to obtain the reliable structures. Harmonic vibrational frequency calculation on each
cture was performed to confirm the global minimum structures.
thank you and the reviewer for your thoughtful suggestions and insights, which aided us to improve
manuscript and provide a more balanced and better account of the research. We hope that the revised
uscript is now suitable for publication in your journal.
