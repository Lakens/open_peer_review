The authors disclosed the preparation of rGO by modified Hummer's method and discussed the
influences of the drying temperature to the properties of rGO product. The morphology, BET and
C/O ratio of the material have been investigated. Though these points have been discussed and
written comprehensively in the manuscript, there are still some issues requiring to be considered.
1) rGO in this paper was synthesized by a modified Hummer's method. Which is the difference
between the process used in this paper and previous reports. Is there any difference of the rGO
properties compared to that of published before?
2) Table 1 listed the element content of as-synthesized products. Why the oxygen content
increased from 22.81% of rGO-250 to 24.46% of rGO-300? Pleased discussed in detail.
3) As shown in the SEM images from Figure 1, the rGO aggregated very much. This would effect
the performance of the electrochemical properties. Is there any method to separate the layers of
the rGO and obtain the fine dispersion?
4) After 50 cycles, the reversible specific capacity of the half-cell remained at 53%. This is quite
poor! Why did the cycle stability deteriorate so quickly?

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors disclosed the preparation of rGO by modified Hummer's method
and discussed the influences of the drying temperature to the properties of rGO
product. The morphology, BET and C/O ratio of the material have been
investigated. Though these points have been discussed and written
comprehensively in the manuscript, there are still some issues requiring to be
considered.
Comment 1: rGO in this paper was synthesized by a modified Hummer's
method. Which is the difference between the process used in this paper and
previous reports. Is there any difference of the rGO properties compared to that
of published before?
The authors wish to thank the reviewer for the valuable time, favorable
and useful comments/suggestions toward the publication of this manuscript.
The Hummer’s method is usually followed to prepare reduced graphite oxide.
During the final washing/filtering with water, the solvent molecules tend to
occupy the interlayer galleries of the hydrophilic graphite oxide. Upon
subsequent annealing of the as-prepared product, the trapped molecules
facilitate the formation of the porous morphology in the final graphite oxide
powder. Since the porous features of the graphite oxide powder influences their
physico-chemical properties, researchers have used various solvents like HBr,
NH3 with different vapor pressures to control the porous morphology and
thereby enhance their electrochemical properties. A very recent report indicated
that the use of HCl with high vapor pressure (than water) as the final filtering
solvent aid in enhancing their porous morphology and simultaneously
facilitating partial reduction during the subsequent drying process at only 120
<U+F0B0>C. This study demonstrated the enhanced electrochemical properties with
respect to rechargeable lithium batteries.
Inspired by the earlier work on HCl, the present work performed a
systematic study on using concentrated HCl as the filtering solvent to prepare
the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) at various drying temperatures of 120, 200,
250, and 300 <U+F0B0>C. The variation of the drying temperatures on the porous
morphology and electrochemical properties in the rGO material was studied in
detail for rechargeable lithium, sodium and potassium battery applications. As
expected, our work confirmed that the drying temperatures also significantly
influenced the surface and electrochemical properties. All these statements have
been included in the revised manuscript. The authors are sincerely thankful to
the reviewer for raising up this valuable point as the motivation and the
uniqueness of the present work could be stated more clearly.
Comment 2: Table 1 listed the element content of as-synthesized products. Why
the oxygen content increased from 22.81% of rGO-250 to 24.46% of rGO-300?
Pleased discussed in detail.
The authors thank the reviewer for the comment. The authors wish to
state that, in addition to drying temperature, annealing environment also can
influence the thermal reduction of GO. Usually, controlled reaction
environments like inert air atmosphere or vacuum conditions are followed for
the thermal reduction of GO. In the present case, as the surface functional
groups containing oxygen groups are removed at high temperatures in open-air
conditions. In general, the absorbed water are evaporated and
hydroxyl/carboxyl group are decomposed under 250 <U+F0B0>C. Given that the open-
air conditions are oxidizing atmospheres, there can be increase in oxygen
content via some chemical reactions like the chemisorption of oxygen by the
active surface carbon. Also, it is possible that the impurities present in open air
could interfere with the sample and cause undesired reactions. Hence, more
studies are required and currently underway to identify the exact reasons for the
slight increase in the oxygen content at 300 <U+F0B0>C. Nevertheless, the authors are
sincerely thankful to the reviewer for his careful analysis of our data and
providing crucial comments for the authors to dwell upon and increase the
quality of the manuscript.
Statements included in the revised manuscript:
“Interestingly, the oxygen content slightly higher for the rGO prepared at 300
<U+F0B0>C than that prepared at 250 <U+F0B0>C. This can be related to the open-air
environments used for the drying process in the present study as the annealing
environment can influence the thermal reduction of GO. Usually, controlled
reaction environments like inert air atmosphere or vacuum conditions are
followed for the thermal reduction of GO. In the present case, the surface
functional groups containing oxygen (absorbed water and hydroxyl/carboxyl
group) are decomposed at temperatures under 250 <U+F0B0>C.22 Given that the open-air
conditions are oxidizing atmospheres, there can be a slight increase in oxygen
content via some chemical reactions like the chemisorption of oxygen by the
active surface carbon. Also, it is possible that the impurities present in open air
could interfere with the sample and cause undesired reactions. Hence, more
studies are required to identify the exact reasons for the slight increase in the
oxygen content at 300 <U+F0B0>C.”
Comment 3: As shown in the SEM images from Figure 1, the rGO aggregated
very much. This would effect the performance of the electrochemical properties.
Is there any method to separate the layers of the rGO and obtain the fine
dispersion?
The authors wish to thank the reviewer for the comment. In this work,
we were tried to use ‘ultra-sonication’ before drying at moderate temperatures.
However, it appears that this method was less effective to separate the layers of
the rGO and obtain the fine dispersion. This can be one of the reasons for the
slight cycling instability observed in the prepared samples. Therefore, an
addition step towards exfoliating the sheets need to be considered as an
immediate direction of research with these materials. Strategies of performing
solvents/surfactants-assisted ultra-sonication or mechanical or thermal methods
to improve the exfoliation in the rGO materials. These statements have been
included in the revised manuscript. However, the authors are sincerely thankful
to the reviewer again for the very useful comment since it has helped to not only
improve the quality of the manuscript but also help in finding inroads to
improve the properties of the prepared materials.
Statements included in the revised manuscript:
“Overall, the SEM images reveal the slight aggregation of the layers in the
prepared samples, especially for the lower temperature samples.”
“Although the aspect of gradual specific capacity decrease, in general, under
repeated cycling is most likely related to the aggregated layers in the rGO
samples, there is room for further improvement in the electrochemical
properties using simple strategies like solvent/surfactant-assisted ultra-
sonication and/or mechanical/thermal methods.”
Comment 4: After 50 cycles, the reversible specific capacity of the half-cell
remained at 53%. This is quite poor! Why did the cycle stability deteriorate so
quickly?
The authors wish to thank the reviewer for the comment. The authors
agree to the reviewer that the electrochemical property is still subject to
improvement. The initial decrease in the specific capacity during cycling is
mostly related to the stabilization of the SEI film formed. The SEI layer was
formed as a result of the reaction of transport ions (Li+, Na+, K+) with residual
oxygen containing functional groups on the electrode surface. The probable
case for the decrease in capacity on short-term cycling is probably related to the
irreversible ion-insertion. This can be related to the possibility that the reduced
graphene oxide layers require to be more separated to facilitate stable insertion.
This is an area that needs to be understood and more studies are underway to
improve their electrochemical properties as this work is only a part of the major
work aimed to find the practical potentiality of these materials in the field of
rechargeable batteries. The present work is only an attempt to show the effect
of the drying temperatures upon the electrochemical properties of the prepared
rGO samples as anodes in rechargeable battery applications. Finally, the
discussed points have been included in the revised manuscript. Nevertheless,
the authors wish to sincerely thank the reviewer for raising up this issue and
encouraging us to dwell deep on the subject of further improving the
electrochemical property of the prepared samples.
Statements included in the revised manuscript:
“The general decrease in the specific capacities during the initial few cycles of
the present samples can arise from the stabilization of the solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI) layer on the electrode surface.8 However, the slight instability
in the specific capacities during repeated cycling can be related to the slightly
aggregated layers in the prepared electrode samples and further investigations
towards layer exfoliation in the rGO samples via chemical or mechanical or
thermal methods are required.”
Comment 5: The author should state the novelty of this work more clearly, such
as process of preparation, properties of product, or electrochemical
performance.
The authors thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. In this work,
we have synthesized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by a modified Hummer’s
method using HCl with higher vapor pressure (than water) as the filtration
solvent followed by subsequent drying in air at various temperatures. The
influence of the drying temperatures upon the porous morphology and the
electrochemical properties of the prepared rGO samples as anode materials
have been investigated in detail for lithium, sodium and potassium battery
applications. This study clearly showed that the drying temperature of 250 <U+F0B0>C
promoted the formation of optimum pore-sizes in the mesopore range and the
corresponding rGO material has potential as anode for emerging rechargeable
battery applications, especially, in NIBs and KIBs. Moreover, the presentation
of a simple drying process with no further chemical/thermal reduction processes
to enhance the porous morphology and improve the electrochemical properties
in graphene oxide electrodes for useful energy storage applications is promising.
These points have been included in the revised manuscript
The authors are thankful again for the comment as it enabled the
description of the work in detail with the purpose and the achievement and
thereby improve the readability of the manuscript.
Statements included in the revised manuscript:
“Moreover, recently, the solvent molecules from the water washing/filtration
step in the Hummer’s method was identified to remain in the interlayers of the
hydrophilic as-prepared product. Upon subsequent annealing, the trapped
molecules facilitate the formation of the porous morphology in the final product.
Since porosity features are known to influence electrochemical properties,
various solvents (other than water) like HBr, NH3 and recently, HCl with
different vapour pressures were utilized to tune the porous formation of GO and
thereby enhance their electrochemical performances. Specifically, the use of
HCl with high vapor pressure (than water) enabled to obtain porous morphology
and simultaneously promote partial reduction in the GO material during drying
at 120 <U+F0B0>C for anode application in rechargeable lithium batteries.
Inspired by these works, the present work performed a systematic study
on using concentrated HCl as the filtering solvent in a modified Hummer’s
method13 to prepare reduced graphene oxide (rGO) at various drying
temperatures of 120, 200, 250, and 300 <U+F0B0>C. No further chemical/thermal
reduction procedure is followed. Electron microscopy and surface analyses
confirmed the accordion-morphology of rGO and their mesoporous
characteristics. The variation of the drying temperatures on the porous
morphology and electrochemical properties in the rGO material was studied in
detail. In other words, the feasibility of using the prepared rGO host for the
insertion/de-insertion of various carrier ions (such as Li+, Na+, and K+) for
energy storage applications is demonstrated. As expected, our work confirmed
that the drying temperatures also significantly influenced the surface and
electrochemical properties. The present study thus showcases the possibility of
using rGO as an electrode material for alternative energy storage systems.”

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript shows a facile synthesis of reduced graphene oxide by
modified Hummer’s method as anode materials. It seems interesting and there
is lot of work. But this manuscript still needs to be revised before it can be
accepted.
Comment 1: In the manuscript, there are few literatures in latest three year
(from 2017). I used “rGO” and “battery” to search in Web of Science, I found
lots of relate literatures. Such as:
APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE, 2019, 465: 470-477. It would be better if the
author can add more latest relate literatures.
Firstly, the authors wish to thank the reviewer for the favorable
comments and suggestions toward the publications of the manuscript. In
accordance to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have included a few references in
the Introduction section. The suggested/above said reference has also been
included in the revised manuscript. The authors are thankful to the reviewer for
suggestion of adequate literature and providing a reference to be cited too.
Comment 2: It would be better, if the authors can put four figures in Fig. 5
together to see the difference of different samples.
The authors are thankful to the reviewer for the comment. In
accordance, the figure was merged in the revised manuscript.
Comment 3: It would be better, if the authors can compare their BET result and
anode capacity with other literatures.
The authors thank the reviewer for the comment. In agreement to the
reviewer’s suggestion, the BET results of a few reduced graphene oxide
prepared for various applications have been mentioned in the revised
manuscript. In addition, one specific result on the rGO used as anode for sodium
battery has been included in the revised manuscript. These points have been
included in the manuscript. Overall, the authors thank the reviewer for the very
useful suggestion and giving us a clear discourse on preparing for the high
quality readership of the esteemed journal.
Statements included in the revised manuscript:
“The maximum surface area values obtained here are competitive to those
reported for the case of reduced graphene oxide prepared for various
applications.32-35”
“For example, Wang et al.,35 developed porous reduced graphene oxide with
high surface area (~330 m2 g-1) and the electrochemical measurement revealed
that reversible sodium storage capacities of 174 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C. Although the
surface area is higher than that measured in the present case, the reversible
specific capacity attained here is quite competitive with the value reported.”
Comment 4. For the electrochemical performance, the authors should provide
the CV curve and the Nyquist plots.
The authors thank the reviewer for the comment. In accordance, the CV
curves for three samples have been provided in the Supporting Information of
the revised manuscript. As expected, the higher the drying temperature, greater
was the charge capacity stored by the electrode sample for the lithium test cells.
Also, the Nyquist plots were compared for the test cells, which were fabricated
using all the prepared electrode samples, after completing the 1st charge cycle.
The results have indicated that although there is no much variation in the charge
transfer resistances at the electrode/electrolyte interface of the test cells, the
slightly improved ion-diffusion in the bulk of the cell with the 250 <U+F0B0>C sample
clearly support the electrochemical data presented for the samples. The detailed
explanation of the results have been provided in the revised manuscript. The
authors are sincerely thankful to the reviewer for raising up such a valuable
issue and making the manuscript better towards its publication.
Statements included in the revised manuscript:
“The cyclic voltammetry profiles recorded for the lithium test cells (Fig. S1)
clearly support the trend of the voltage profiles showing increased specific
capacity for higher drying temperatures.”
“Nevertheless, the reasoning for the slightly better electrochemical
performance of the rGO sample prepared at 250 <U+F0B0>C, especially for sodium and
potassium test cells, was attempted. To clearly understand the influence of the
drying temperature toward the electrochemical performance of rGO electrode
in coin cell, PEIS measurement was performed for all rGO samples with Na
metal anode under a determined voltage range of 0.02-2.0V and 0.5C (187.5
mA g-1) current density. Fig. 7(a) represents the Nyquist plot of the first-charge
impedance behavior in the frequency range of 1MHz-10mHz. The compressed
semicircle magnitude is steadily enlarged with raising temperatures and ended
at 28.3, 38.7 and 48.9 ohm for the rGO- 120, 200 and 300 samples, respectively.
Interestingly, the rGO-250 sample exhibited an out-of-trend behavior thereby
suggesting a different mechanism. Hence, an electrical equivalent circuit (EEC)
analysis was performed using Z-VIEW software, providing a closet analog
description of the electrochemical kinetics. Accordingly, the EEC contained a
resistor Rs in series with two parallel RC combinations (RSEI + CPE1, RCT +
CPE2), and connected to a Warburg element, WDiffusion, as shown in Fig. 7 (a)
(inset). The detailed information of these components is listed in Table 3.
According to our previous study, the physical meaning of the EEC elements
that describe the steps for lithium-ion insertion are proposed as follows: (i) Rs
is attributed to the ion transport inside the separator and the electrolyte; (ii) the
RSEI + CPE1combination represents lithium migration through the SEI layer;
(iii) the RCT + CPE2 group reflects the charge-transfer at the
electrode/electrolyte interface; and (iv) WDiffusion illustrates the lithium-ion
diffusion inside the bulk phase of the active material.39,40 Taking a cue from
these, the variations of RS, RSEI, RCT, and RDiffusion values at the first-charge state
regarding different temperature samples for the sodium-ion test cells are
provided in Fig. 7 (b). The system (RS) and SEI layer (RSEI) resistances occupy
a minor distribution in the total resistance, which steadily retained for all
samples. Furthermore, the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) tends to increase at
the higher temperature of 200 and 300ºC samples. Most importantly, the
diffusion resistance (RDiffusion) of rGO-250 sample shows the lowest values of
16.8 ohm more than three-fold less than rGO-300 samples (56.49 ohm). This
implies a drastic improvement in the ion-diffusion conductivity due to the
optimized drying temperature of 250ºC. This PEIS study matches well with the
galvanostatic results in previous sections. Additionally, the best performance is
related to their high specific surface area and optimum pore-size distribution,
as indicated in Table 2.”
Comment 5: It seems that, the performance in this manuscript is not good
enough.
a) The author should compare the performance of the anode using the
Hummer’s method.
The authors thank the reviewer for the comment. The authors agree that
comparing the performances of the samples prepared from the original
Hummer’s method is understandable. However, the sample prepared by this
method is not sufficient to enhance graphite oxide property generally. Since this
result is well-known, the authors have avoided the inclusion of this sample in
the manuscript. Instead, we have attempted to make a meaningful comparison
of the electrochemical properties of the prepared samples with the
commercially available graphite powder.
b) Why only temperature was chosen to do sensitivity?
Inspired by the previous work of using HCl as a filtration solvent for
the preparation of rGO samples n a modified Hummer’s reaction, the present
work performed a systematic study on using concentrated HCl as the filtering
solvent to prepare the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) at various drying
temperatures of 120, 200, 250, and 300 <U+F0B0>C. The variation of the drying
temperatures on the porous morphology and electrochemical properties in the
rGO material was studied in detail for rechargeable lithium, sodium and
potassium battery applications. As expected, our work confirmed that the
drying temperatures also significantly influenced the surface and
electrochemical properties. Further studies are underway to understand the
other variation parameters and will be studied in detail in the near future.
However, the authors are sincerely thankful to the reviewer again for the very
useful comment as it will help in improving further the properties of the
prepared materials.
c) Please give some comment on how to further improve the performance?
The authors are thankful to the reviewer for the comment. The authors
agree to the reviewer that the electrochemical property is still subject to
improvement. The performance instability can be related to the observation of
slightly aggregated rGO layers. It could be that the method of ultra-sonication
used was not very effective to completely separate the layers of the rGO and
obtain the fine dispersion. This can be one of the reasons for the slight cycling
instability observed in the prepared samples. Therefore, an addition step
towards exfoliating the sheets need to be considered as an immediate direction
of research with these materials. Strategies of performing solvents/surfactants-
assisted ultra-sonication or mechanical or thermal methods to improve the
exfoliation in the rGO materials. All these statements have been included in the
revised manuscript. The authors wish to sincerely thank the reviewer again for
the valuable comment to tune-up the article quality for better readership.
Statements included in the revised manuscript:
“Although the aspect of gradual specific capacity decrease, in general, under
repeated cycling is most likely related to the aggregated layers in the rGO
samples, there is room for further improvement in the electrochemical
properties using simple strategies like solvent/surfactant-assisted ultra-
sonication and/or mechanical/thermal methods. In addition, the possibility of
tuning other parameters including the annealing environment and heating rate
could also be adopted to arrive at enhanced electrochemical properties.”
In conclusion, we wish to state that all these changes performed are
highlighted in yellow in the re-submitted manuscript for easy identification.
Also, we have included all the above references in the revised manuscript. We
strongly believe that we have considered the recommendation of the reviewers
and have performed the changes required in the manuscript and thereby
enhanced the manuscript by modifying some of the original sentences and
including new sentences to provide an adequate literature review. We are hugely
indebted to the reviewers for their patience in providing us very valuable
comments towards making our manuscript better for publication.
