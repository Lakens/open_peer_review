In this paper, various characteristics related to soil and plant in different plots are studied, and
the relationship between them is further analyzed, which certainly are of great scientific values
for land reclamation and ecological restoration in western China with fragile eco-environment.
However, there still exist some improvements. Followings are the specific suggestion:
1. The Introduction can be further persuasive. For example, for paragraph 1, how about adding
some explicit negative effects or data to illustrate the destruction of eco-environment.
2. The interaction of soil and plant is the main part of the article, so in Introduction, more research
reviews about relation between soil and plant can be made to make readers gain an overall
understanding about this field. The following references can help authors to improve this issue.
Effects of vegetation on runoff and soil erosion on reclaimed land in an opencast coal-mine dump
in a loess area
Use of Reclaimed Mine Soil Index (RMSI) for screening of tree species for reclamation of coal
mine degraded land.
Changes in carbon sink value based on RS and GIS in the Heidaigou opencast coal mine.
3. P3L36: Soil classification should use international soil classification.
4. P4L40: remove “and”.
5. In terms of Results and discussion, part 5.1, 0.8 and 1.2 were selected to compare the value of
Vi/Si, is there any scientific evidence of that?
6. Furthermore, in Results and discussion part, if soil was found to be lagged developed, further
explanation can be made to find out why soil is developed lagged and what kind of nutrient is
the restraint factor.

Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Quantitative correlations between soil and plants in reclaimed
mining dumps using coupling coordination degree model” (ID: RSOS-180484).
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our
paper. We have studied comments carefully and have made correction which we
hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The main
corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as
flowing:
Reviewer #1:
[1]. The Introduction can be further persuasive. For example, for paragraph 1, how
about adding some explicit negative effects or data to illustrate the destruction of
eco-environment.
Response:
Thanks for Reviewer #1’s suggestion. We added some explicit results of
researches to illustrate the negative effects in Introduction Part. The following
references have been added.
5 Li, S., Di, X., Wu, D., Zhang, J. 2013 Effects of sewage sludge and nitrogen
fertilizer on herbage growth and soil fertility improvement in restoration of the
abandoned opencast mining areas in Shanxi, China. Environmental Earth Sciences.

C, N and P of mine spoils in a dry tropical environment. Canadian Journal of Soil
Science. 69, 849-855.
[2]. The interaction of soil and plant is the main part of the article, so in
Introduction, more research reviews about relation between soil and plant can be
made to make readers gain an overall understanding about this field. The following
references can help authors to improve this issue.
Effects of vegetation on runoff and soil erosion on reclaimed land in an opencast
coal-mine dump in a loess area
Use of Reclaimed Mine Soil Index (RMSI) for screening of tree species for
reclamation of coal mine degraded land.
Changes in carbon sink value based on RS and GIS in the Heidaigou opencast coal
mine.
Response:
We studied the three papers above carefully and selected the most related one to
reveal the relation between soil and plant in paragraph 3 of Introduction. The
following reference has been added.
16 Mukhopadhyay, S., Maiti, S. K., Masto, R. E. 2013 Use of Reclaimed Mine
Soil Index (RMSI) for screening of tree species for reclamation of coal mine
degraded land. Ecological Engineering. 57, 133-142.
[3]. P3L36: Soil classification should use international soil classification.
Response:
We have changed the Chinese soil classification to international soil classification.
[4]. P4L40: remove “and”.
Response:
We have removed the “and” in the paper.
[5]. In terms of Results and discussion, part 5.1, 0.8 and 1.2 were selected to
compare the value of Vi/Si, is there any scientific evidence of that?
Response:
For there is no standard to evaluate the value of Vi/Si, we just referred to previous
research to explain the result in our paper.
[6]. Furthermore, in Results and discussion part, if soil was found to be lagged
developed, further explanation can be made to find out why soil is developed
lagged and what kind of nutrient is the restraint factor.
Response:
We have concluded the key points from the results and explained in Result and
discussion part.
[7]. P11L14: “WuXiao, ZhenqiHu, JingLi, HeyuZhang, JialiangHu”, Please check
it.
Response:
We have revised the format of Reference 41.
[8]. P11L14: “Scientific Reports. 6,” <U+2192> “Scientific Reports. 6,22058”
Response:
We have made revision of Reference 52.
[9]. P11L14: Zhen-Wei, H. E., It should be “He, Z. W.”
Response:
We have checked the format of Reference 53 and revised it.
[10]. Figure 1 is not clear.
Response:
We have made a new figure to replace the old one.
Other Revisions
[1]. In the process of modifying the graphics, Ruicong Xu gave me a hand, so we
have added Ruicong Xu as one of the authors.
[2]. Authors’ contributions Part: we added the contribution of our new author.
