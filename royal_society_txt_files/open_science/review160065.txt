Thank you for the opportunity to review this revision.
The study builds evidence of the presence of thixotropic characterises in the transition phase
between static and movement. This seems to be consistent with the current models of
understanding the modulation of muscle fibre mechanical characteristics.
The scope and coverage of the literature is relevant and appropriate.
It is my opinion that the wavelet assessments are valid and in general the design and analysis are
consistent with the purpose of the report. The SD error bars seem small for the sample size.
I believe that the writing style is appropriate (but novel) as I am not used to results being
presented in the introduction.
There is one facet of the paper that may warrant consideration since it may influence the results
and hence the discussion.
1. The change in the frequency of the EMG signal is a very small magnitude. Some of the
associations between EMG frequency and other DV were weak and unlikely to be separated out
by the position (finger angle) covariate (i.e. the position is likely to have a collinearity with the
other variables hence difficult to separate out). This observation forms the basis of some of the
evidence for the hypothesised thixotropy. Although I believe that this hypothesis is a likely to be
valid the authors should acknowledge (or investigate in future studies) the possibility that this
may have been measurement artefact rather than a true biological or drive output variable. The
case for this is simple - is the change in the frequency 0.81Hz over the range of 30 degrees
associated with the change in muscle fibre orientation relative to the bipolar surface EMG
electrodes?
2. It would be my opinion that other factors (noted in the text) that may influence the EMG
signal outputs i.e. a) the recruitment b) rate encoding and c) electromechanical delay – [nullified
due to the Phase plane assessment techniques of the FFT / Wavelet] would be relatively smaller
than the potential of the EMG signal shift for the electrode orientation.
3. Adding a small load / angle to modulate the effects of gravity to control for the resonant
frequency would also allow an analysis of the tremor / stiffness and EMG frequency drive to
determine if stiffness changes between passive and movement initiation.
Relating the mechanism to function.
It is applicable to provide valid example for the reader ‘stationary to movement’ transition , but
the Standing to Walking example is very general.
In reality the greatest functional impact probably lies at single joints where there is a need to
maintain static joint orientation (stability) and then shift to dynamic tasks at an appropriate time.
i.e. transfer of angular momentum (inertial forces) in kinetic chain movements
Further discussion ( future research)
One aspect of the biological function that may be related to muscle thixotrophy is that associated
with motor control in both afferent and efferent domains. The transition from static to movement
in the sensory domain is a critical feature of optimising the functional capacity. Hence the
evidence of the thixotropic modulation of stiffness just prior to the initiation of movement could
be argued to play a role in optimising the joint position feedback just prior to the initiation of
movement. This is an unexplored area of research. In the static situation joint position sense
(including feedback on the level of muscle activation) is critical for forward planning. This is
important in dynamic movements because there are situation where sub-elements of the kinetic
chain are relatively static or very stiff and this is required for optimal transfer of angular
3
momentum (for example) . Dynamic JPS is an order of magnitude poorer than static JPS.. muscle
thixotropic behaviours may contribute. (Just saying probably not important for the paper but
interesting for the science).
Overall, very interesting, well studied and contributing to the body of knowledge.

Title: Physiological tremor reveals how thixotropy adapts skeletal muscle for posture and
movement
The aim of this study was to describe the effect of transitions between posture and movement on
muscle properties. Tremor about the middle finger was used to indicate muscle output. The
movement task entailed the performance of postural (tremor) tasks whereby subjects transitioned
to an alternating (flexion/extension) action. For this task, subjects used their middle finger while
the remaining digits of the hand were secured. Surface EMG activity as obtained from a single
muscle, extensor digitorum communis (EDC). Overall the experiment was well designed, the
analyses appropriate and, in general, the manuscript was well written. Consequently, the
concerns I had should be relatively simple to address.
One aspect that was missing from the current submission were any clear aims or hypotheses.
While these are not critical, some outlining of the general aim(s) of this study would help guide
the reader as to the overall rationale for this study.
The only major concern related to this manuscript is the “all-or-nothing” perspective which tends
to dominate the discussion (this point was also raised in another reviewers comments). While the
results presented are certainly of interest, the explanation provided tends to be dominated by a
4
black-and-white portrayal of the data. There are several examples of this practice that are worth
highlighting.
[1] The argument is made that “There is no simple relationship between the frequency of the
acceleration (which alters a lot) and the frequency of the EMG (which alters only a little). This
suggests that finger tremor is not generated by a specific neural input. Hence, the alternative
possibility seems more likely – the characteristics of finger tremor are determined by the
mechanical properties of the limb”. This statement tends to fly counter to many other tremor
studies that argue that tremor itself is derived from the combination of influences including
central/peripheral neural influences and mechanical aspects (note that no single input is
completely eliminated). The fact that EMG activity cannot explain all of the tremor does not
mean that its origin must be mechanical.
[2] The statement is made that “movement which cannot easily be attributed to concomitant
change in the EMG which drives the muscle”. However, this claim is overstated for a number of
reasons.
Firstly, EMG activity was only recorded form a single muscle even though the movement task
involves both an extension and flexion component. Although mention is made with regards to
recording from the finger flexor (page 10) there is no data/evidence to support the claims made.
Rather the reader is left to believe the authors that activity in the flexor hardly exceeded the
background activity. Typically, when performing flexion/extension actions of a discrete nature,
a biphasic/triphasic pattern of muscle activity is evident. If the movement is of sufficient
velocity, then some activity in the flexor would be expected to assist with either initiating the
flexion action or braking the extensor action of the movement. Alternatively, for slower
movements (which may be more likely for the current study), the amplitude of any antagonist
activity is often reduced since the limb movements can be braked by the passive mechanical
properties of the limb itself (for example, see some of the older work on the triphasic EMG by
Lestienne, Polit & Bizzi (1980), Mustard and Lee (1987), Brown & Gilleard (1991) etc.,). What
these studies collectively highlight is that the muscle responses during very slow, discrete
movements (and the rationale behind the lack of activity) is already relatively well known and
documented in the literature. With this body of research in mind, it would be worthwhile
tempering some of the statements made throughout the discussion regarding the link between
the mechanical aspects of finger tremor and movement.
Overall, I would encourage the authors to tone down statements such as these (and others) to
provide a more even evaluation of their data. While their results are certainly of interest and
merit, the unequivocal manner in which they are presented seems heavy handed.
Other Comments
[1] The authors also seem to have an a-priori assumption that postural tremor and movement
dynamics are one in the same thing (page 10) rather than considering the view that the movement
profile could be a distinct entity from tremor. The protocol used in this study is similar in many
contexts to that employed for isometric force production where both sinusoidal and constant
tracking tasks are performed. For these tasks, the movement component (i.e. the target force) is
typically subtracted from the force production aspect which leaves the force fluctuation (tremor)
component for further analysis. For this protocol, the assumption is that it is necessary to clearly
delineate between the movement production aspect and the tremor component. I would be
interested to know why the authors did not consider such as procedure for this data.
[2] One methodological issue relates to the selection of the middle finger for this task (the index
and ring fingers were externally secured). Given that EDC works over all these three segments,
restricting the motion of two would have a limiting response on the movement potential of the
middle finger for this task (i.e. it is difficult to move the middle finger through a full range of
5
motion while the other fingers are secured since now). It is entirely possible that the described
results may (in part) be due to the inability of the EDC muscle to operate fully since its action
would be limited by the restrictions of the index and ring fingers.
[3] It is not entirely correct that the “the transition (between movement and posture) has not been
characterized”. There are other studies which have attempted to assess the relation between
tremor and movement. For example, Goodman and Kelso (1983) assessed the relation between
tremor and finger motion (see Goodman & Kelso, Exploring the functional significance of
physiological tremor: A biospectroscopic approach. EBR, 1983. 49: p. 419-431). Similarly,
Wessburg and Vallbo (J Physiol, 1995), and Morrison et al (Motor Control, 2012) have also
assessed the differences between tremor/posture and movement (albeit using different tasks).
Collectively these previous studies report a number of similar findings with regards to the
acceleration and EMG frequency results reported in this study. Although none of these studies
have addressed the issue of the transition from posture to movement in exactly the same context,
they do show that other studies have examined this issue so it is not correct to state that no other
study has characterized the transition (please note this is not to imply that these studies should be
added, simply that it would be better if it were toned down).
[4] The term “movement” is used in a number of different context which confuses some of the
issues within the current manuscript. It is used to describe movement of the muscles themselves
(i.e., “…differences between muscles when they are moving…” page 3) and in the context of the
overall global context of movement of a limb or body part. While there is certainly movement
within muscle during its activation, this is different (in context and in amount) from the motion
of a given limb segment as described for the finger action. Given how this study is designed I
would suggest the authors restrict their use of the term to limb movement per se rather than
jump from one context to another.
[5] Is there a reason why the EMG signal as downsampled to 100 Hz? Even with rectification,
there is the possibility that aspects of the signal may have been eliminated. A simple way to
resolve this would be to include a simple representative figure of the EMG and acceleration
frequency spectrum for the movement and holding components of the task separately.
[6] What filtering was performed for the position data?
[7] What were the “target frequencies” mentioned for the filtering of the acceleration signal?

Thank you for submitting your revised manuscript. I have read the revised version and your
point-by-point response, and I am satisfied that you have fully addressed the concerns raised by
the reviewers.
One minor comment on the revised version:
On line 79, the word ‘parsimoniously’, might be better than ‘economically’ be in this context,
since ‘economically’ might be interpreted as a reference to energetics of the task, which I don’t
think is intended here.

Thank you for the opportunity to review this revision.
The study builds evidence of the presence of thixotropic characterises in the transition phase between
tatic and movement. This seems to be consistent with the current models of understanding the
modulation of muscle fibre mechanical characteristics.
The scope and coverage of the literature is relevant and appropriate.
t is my opinion that the wavelet assessments are valid and in general the design and analysis are
consistent with the purpose of the report. The SD error bars seem small for the sample size.
believe that the writing style is appropriate (but novel) as I am not used to results being presented in
he introduction.
We thank the reviewer for their time and for their positive words
There is one facet of the paper that may warrant consideration since it may influence the results and
hence the discussion.
1. The change in the frequency of the EMG signal is a very small magnitude. Some of the
associations between EMG frequency and other DV were weak and unlikely to be separated out by the
position (finger angle) covariate (i.e. the position is likely to have a collinearity with the other
variables hence difficult to separate out). This observation forms the basis of some of the evidence for
he hypothesised thixotropy. Although I believe that this hypothesis is a likely to be valid the authors
hould acknowledge (or investigate in future studies) the possibility that this may have been
measurement artefact rather than a true biological or drive output variable. The case for this is simple
is the change in the frequency 0.81Hz over the range of 30 degrees associated with the change in
muscle fibre orientation relative to the bipolar surface EMG electrodes?
We agree that there is always uncertainty in interpreting changes in the spectrum of EMG. In
principle, shifts in the relative position of the muscle and the recording electrodes might produce
changes in the spectral content. Our experiments involved a fixed wrist combined with finger
movement limited to 30 degrees, which is quite a small proportion of the total range of the EDC
muscle. Nevertheless, there is potential for this to alter the shape of the EMG spectrum. This would be
particularly an issue in the spectrum of the surface interference pattern. By analysing the spectrum of
produced by central control or reflexive drive (although we fully accept that this is not a perfect
olution – for example as reviewed by Farina et al. 2004. J Applied Physiol. 96, p1486-1495). Without
making control measurements at different muscle lengths under isometric conditions, it is impossible
o eliminate effects produced by altered position. And in that case there is the difficulty of knowing
what force to choose to match the isotonic conditions.
We show that as the finger position rises and falls, the EMG changes. It becomes bigger overall as the
inger rises and its peak frequency also increases from about 12 to 14 Hz. These changes probably
epresent the increased force demand, as it is argued in the manuscript. However, the referee is correct
hat they might alternatively be caused by movement of muscle with respect to the
electrodes. However, we do not see this as a major problem. We were merely stating that the change in
EMG was indeed small and not directly related to changes we found in tremor (figure 4).
We have redrafted the paper so that we include the possibility that the shift in spectral shape is due to
muscle position changes (for instance see line 270 - 273). However, we feel that our central point
emains: there is a mismatch between the frequency of the relatively sharply peaked frequency of the
acceleration and the rounded peak of the demodulated EMG. If the small change in EMG frequency
would indeed turn out to be artefactual, we feel that this would not detract from our conclusions
elating to the mechanical origin of tremor.
2. It would be my opinion that other factors (noted in the text) that may influence the EMG signal
outputs i.e. a) the recruitment b) rate encoding and c) electromechanical delay – [nullified due to the
Phase plane assessment techniques of the FFT / Wavelet] would be relatively smaller than the
potential of the EMG signal shift for the electrode orientation.
t is difficult to determine with certainty the exact cause of the changes in the EMG signal. As the
magnitude of the EMG signal seems to be very strongly and positively related to the finger position,
we think an increase in force demand (as described above) would be the most likely candidate. Also,
as further expanded upon in response to the reviewer’s comment underneath, in our previous
experiment force demand increased while electrode orientation did not. This experiment gave us
imilar results with regards to EMG magnitude and frequency to those currently reported. All the
ame, our main point is that the changes in tremor characteristics are not directly linked to changes in
EMG characteristics, independent of the cause of the EMG changes.
3. Adding a small load / angle to modulate the effects of gravity to control for the resonant
requency would also allow an analysis of the tremor / stiffness and EMG frequency drive to
determine if stiffness changes between passive and movement initiation.
We appreciate the suggestion about experimentally manipulating the load, and in fact this was the
ubject of a recent paper (Lakie et al. 2015. J Physiol 593, p4411-4422) in which we span subjects in a
centrifuge to alter their postural load. An interesting finding was that as gravitational field increased,
remor size and its frequency also increased. At the same time, there was little change in the frequency
of the EMG. EMG size got bigger overall and its frequency seemed to rise with a similar range of
requencies as reported in the current manuscript (see figure 6 and 7 of Lakie et al., 2015). These
esults manifested under conditions where there was no change in muscle length. We interpreted this
as an increase in motor output (increasing tremor size) and an increase in stiffness (increasing tremor
requency), while there would not be large muscle position shifts. Therefore, we conclude that changes
hat this is not the case.
Relating the mechanism to function.
t is applicable to provide valid example for the reader ‘stationary to movement’ transition, but the
Standing to Walking example is very general. In reality the greatest functional impact probably lies at
ingle joints where there is a need to maintain static joint orientation (stability) and then shift to
dynamic tasks at an appropriate time. i.e. transfer of angular momentum (inertial forces) in kinetic
chain movements
We agree that the manuscript would benefit from an example relating the thixotropy mechanism to
unction. We now refer to the example of a man raising a gun in the last paragraph of the discussion.
This task generates a conflict between movement and stability. The marksman’s muscles are not very
tiff when the gun is raised to enable a large angular momentum. His muscles then get very stiff when
he takes aim to maintain joint orientation. The transition in muscle stiffness solves the conflicting
equirements of flexibility and speed during fast action, and accuracy and stability at rest.
Further discussion (future research)
One aspect of the biological function that may be related to muscle thixotrophy is that associated with
motor control in both afferent and efferent domains. The transition from static to movement in the
ensory domain is a critical feature of optimising the functional capacity. Hence the evidence of the
hixotropic modulation of stiffness just prior to the initiation of movement could be argued to play a
ole in optimising the joint position feedback just prior to the initiation of movement. This is an
unexplored area of research. In the static situation joint position sense (including feedback on the level
of muscle activation) is critical for forward planning. This is important in dynamic movements
because there are situation where sub-elements of the kinetic chain are relatively static or very stiff
and this is required for optimal transfer of angular momentum (for example) . Dynamic JPS is an
order of magnitude poorer than static JPS.. muscle thixotropic behaviours may contribute. (Just
aying probably not important for the paper but interesting for the science).
We thank the referee for this comment. There is a general belief that sensory inflow is attenuated
during movement (e.g. Collins et al. 1998. J Physiol 508, p.635-643). As muscle begins to move it
becomes less stiff. So it might appear that the sensitivity of muscle spindles is likely to increase, which
of course might be expected to produce increased sensitivity rather than decreased sensitivity. It may
be that the neural system actively gates the sensory signal to prevent overload as suggested by Collins
et al. This is something that we hope to investigate soon.
Overall, very interesting, well studied and contributing to the body of knowledge.

Title: Physiological tremor reveals how thixotropy adapts skeletal muscle for posture and movement
muscle properties. Tremor about the middle finger was used to indicate muscle output. The
movement task entailed the performance of postural (tremor) tasks whereby subjects transitioned to an
alternating (flexion/extension) action. For this task, subjects used their middle finger while the
emaining digits of the hand were secured. Surface EMG activity as obtained from a single muscle,
extensor digitorum communis (EDC). Overall the experiment was well designed, the analyses
appropriate and, in general, the manuscript was well written. Consequently, the concerns I had should
be relatively simple to address.
We thank the reviewer for their time and for their positive words
One aspect that was missing from the current submission were any clear aims or hypotheses. While
hese are not critical, some outlining of the general aim(s) of this study would help guide the reader as
o the overall rationale for this study.
We have now added the following hypotheses to our introduction (line 73-76):
1) tremor frequency will be modulated as a limb alternates between posture and movement
2) the frequency modulation can be economically explained by mechanical changes in muscle tissue
3) EMG magnitude will reflect the load but its frequency composition will not relate to tremor
requency
The only major concern related to this manuscript is the “all-or-nothing” perspective which tends to
dominate the discussion (this point was also raised in another reviewers comments). While the results
presented are certainly of interest, the explanation provided tends to be dominated by a black-and-
white portrayal of the data. There are several examples of this practice that are worth highlighting.
1] The argument is made that “There is no simple relationship between the frequency of the
acceleration (which alters a lot) and the frequency of the EMG (which alters only a little). This
uggests that finger tremor is not generated by a specific neural input. Hence, the alternative
possibility seems more likely – the characteristics of finger tremor are determined by the mechanical
properties of the limb”. This statement tends to fly counter to many other tremor studies that argue
hat tremor itself is derived from the combination of influences including central/peripheral neural
nfluences and mechanical aspects (note that no single input is completely eliminated). The fact that
EMG activity cannot explain all of the tremor does not mean that its origin must be mechanical.
The reviewer is of course correct. Maybe we have gotten a bit too enthusiastic. The fact that any
alterations in our EMG signals could not directly or easily be linked to the alterations in the tremor
characteristics does not unequivocally imply that tremor is unrelated to the EMG input. Specifically in
cases like fatiguing and certain pathological conditions, where the EMG spectrum shows very specific
and sharp frequencies, there is an undeniable clear influence of EMG on tremor characteristics.
However, our results of this and previous studies seem to suggest that in normal, healthy
circumstances, where not too much force is required, the size and frequency of the EMG did not seem
o have much of an influence on tremor.
To avoid dogmatism, we have now reformulated our argument as an open question so that readers may
consider the evidence and make up their own minds. (see for instance line 240-243 and line 255-257)
2] The statement is made that “movement which cannot easily be attributed to concomitant change in
he EMG which drives the muscle”. However, this claim is overstated for a number of reasons.
Firstly, EMG activity was only recorded form a single muscle even though the movement task
nvolves both an extension and flexion component. Although mention is made with regards to
made. Rather the reader is left to believe the authors that activity in the flexor hardly exceeded the
background activity. Typically, when performing flexion/extension actions of a discrete nature, a
biphasic/triphasic pattern of muscle activity is evident. If the movement is of sufficient velocity, then
ome activity in the flexor would be expected to assist with either initiating the flexion action or
braking the extensor action of the movement. Alternatively, for slower movements (which may be
more likely for the current study), the amplitude of any antagonist activity is often reduced since the
imb movements can be braked by the passive mechanical properties of the limb itself (for example,
ee some of the older work on the triphasic EMG by Lestienne, Polit & Bizzi (1980), Mustard and Lee
1987), Brown & Gilleard (1991) etc.,). What these studies collectively highlight is that the muscle
esponses during very slow, discrete movements (and the rationale behind the lack of activity) is
already relatively well known and documented in the literature. With this body of research in mind, it
would be worthwhile tempering some of the statements made throughout the discussion regarding the
ink between the mechanical aspects of finger tremor and movement.
The triphasic response is mainly a feature of rapid movement initiation. The maximal movement
velocity (which was attained slowly) was only 3 deg/sec which is extremely slow. This probably
explains why we were unable to record any meaningful signal from the finger flexor muscles. For the
peeds that we studied, as the reviewer says, the braking forces were almost certainly passive and
mechanical. However, we do accept the main point which is that we should avoid dogmatism. In our
defence, we would emphasise that there has been a tendency in the literature to discuss “10 Hz tremor”
as though it provides “a window into the operation of the nervous system” (indeed this is a quote from
a recent review). What this study demonstrates is that systematic and quite large alterations in tremor
requency can be generated (in this case by movement, in a recently published paper by altered
gravitational field) and it is not at all easy to explain these changes as being produced by a neurogenic
oscillator. On the other hand, it is quite easy to attribute them to mechanical causes. Perhaps in our
enthusiasm we tended to overstate our case. We have now reformulated our conclusions as open
questions so that readers may consider the evidence and make up their own minds. (see for instance
ine 233-243 and line 255-257)
Overall, I would encourage the authors to tone down statements such as these (and others) to provide a
more even evaluation of their data. While their results are certainly of interest and merit, the
unequivocal manner in which they are presented seems heavy handed.
We have toned down our statement and have reformulated our conclusions as questions. We hope that
his seems less heavy handed.
Other Comments
1] The authors also seem to have an a-priori assumption that postural tremor and movement dynamics
are one in the same thing (page 10) rather than considering the view that the movement profile could
be a distinct entity from tremor. The protocol used in this study is similar in many contexts to that
employed for isometric force production where both sinusoidal and constant tracking tasks are
performed. For these tasks, the movement component (i.e. the target force) is typically subtracted
rom the force production aspect which leaves the force fluctuation (tremor) component for further
analysis. For this protocol, the assumption is that it is necessary to clearly delineate between the
movement production aspect and the tremor component. I would be interested to know why the
authors did not consider such as procedure for this data.
The reviewer is suggesting that the target represents a certain acceleration profile. The tremor is the
otal amount of acceleration. Some of the total is therefore intentional (imposed by following the
acceleration profile from the total acceleration but it makes negligible difference because the intended
acceleration is so tiny. In practice, a more significant issue is tilt of the accelerometer being registered
as an acceleration signal. In this paper we high-pass filtered the acceleration signal at 0.1 Hz (twice the
maximal frequency of movement) so that any acceleration relating to the movement profile was
eliminated.
2] One methodological issue relates to the selection of the middle finger for this task (the index and
ing fingers were externally secured). Given that EDC works over all these three segments, restricting
he motion of two would have a limiting response on the movement potential of the middle finger for
his task (i.e. it is difficult to move the middle finger through a full range of motion while the other
ingers are secured since now). It is entirely possible that the described results may (in part) be due to
he inability of the EDC muscle to operate fully since its action would be limited by the restrictions of
he index and ring fingers.
n our experiment, the wrist, the index finger and the ring finger were taped to a static device while the
middle finger was free to move. Whereas the EDC muscle activates all of these fingers, a quick test
where the ring and index fingers are not taped but are supported (for instance by the left hand) reveals
hat actually it is very easy to move the middle finger separately from the others over a range that is
much larger than the 30 degrees asked in the experiment (up to ~90 degrees). Therefore, we are
positive that the requested movement was well within the limits of the subjects comfortable range of
motion in this setup (which is now also stated in the manuscript in line 111).
[3] It is not entirely correct that the “the transition (between movement and posture) has not been
characterized”. There are other studies which have attempted to assess the relation between tremor
and movement. For example, Goodman and Kelso (1983) assessed the relation between tremor and
inger motion (see Goodman & Kelso, Exploring the functional significance of physiological tremor:
A biospectroscopic approach. EBR, 1983. 49: p. 419-431). Similarly, Wessburg and Vallbo (J
Physiol, 1995), and Morrison et al (Motor Control, 2012) have also assessed the differences between
remor/posture and movement (albeit using different tasks). Collectively these previous studies report
a number of similar findings with regards to the acceleration and EMG frequency results reported in
his study. Although none of these studies have addressed the issue of the transition from posture to
movement in exactly the same context, they do show that other studies have examined this issue so it
s not correct to state that no other study has characterized the transition (please note this is not to
mply that these studies should be added, simply that it would be better if it were toned down).
The reviewer correctly states that there are several studies which have looked at the relationship
between tremor and finger motion (including one by one of the present authors (Lakie and Combes
2000, J Physiol, 523, 515-522). However, none of these studies look at the gradual evolution from
postural to kinetic tremor, which was the main aim and novelty of our current study. The quoted
tudies all looked at either very rapid movement compared to posture or looked at both posture and
apid (triphasic type) voluntary movement. Although these studies have added significant knowledge
on the relationship between tremor and finger movement, we are unaware of any study examining
remor specifically during the transition between posture and movement.
The complete statement the reviewer quotes reads: ‘This is important because although tremor during
slow) movement has been claimed to be fundamentally different from postural tremor [21], the
ransition has not been characterised.’ To our knowledge this is still correct. Nevertheless, we have
now altered this sentence to include that the relationship between tremor and movement has been
tudied before to emphasise our focus. (see line 230 - 233)
within the current manuscript. It is used to describe movement of the muscles themselves (i.e.,
“…differences between muscles when they are moving…” page 3) and in the context of the overall
global context of movement of a limb or body part. While there is certainly movement within muscle
during its activation, this is different (in context and in amount) from the motion of a given limb
egment as described for the finger action. Given how this study is designed I would suggest the
authors restrict their use of the term to limb movement per se rather than jump from one context to
another.
We agree that we should avoid any confusion in this respect. We have now changed any reference of
muscle movement’ to ‘muscle lengthening or shortening’ throughout the manuscript.
5] Is there a reason why the EMG signal as downsampled to 100 Hz? Even with rectification, there is
he possibility that aspects of the signal may have been eliminated. A simple way to resolve this
would be to include a simple representative figure of the EMG and acceleration frequency spectrum
or the movement and holding components of the task separately.
We have downsampled our EMG signal to 100Hz as we were not interested in frequencies >50Hz. A
benefit was that downsampling the EMG to 100Hz made the wavelet analysis much faster. We do
however understand the point of the reviewer that a representative figure including EMG and
acceleration FFTs of different parts of the task would improve the clarity and overall understanding of
he paper. We have now added the figure proposed by the reviewer to our manuscript. The new figure
s discussed in the methods and results section (see figure 2, line 125 – 129 and line 166 – 171).
6] What filtering was performed for the position data?
Position was downsampled to 100Hz. This signal was used for correlation calculations. It was then
averaged over subjects and trials and smoothed with a running average of 0.4s for plotting purposes
only. (see line 130 and line 155 - 157)
7] What were the “target frequencies” mentioned for the filtering of the acceleration signal?
The target started with a stationary neutral position (0 Hz) after which it moved into a vertically
oriented sinusoid with a frequency linearly increasing to 0.05 Hz. The target then decelerated in a
mirror image to the neutral position (0 Hz). The frequencies incorporated in the target signal thus vary
between 0 and 0.05 Hz. As we high-pass filtered the acceleration signal at 0.1 Hz (twice the maximal
arget frequency), we eliminated any movement artefacts due to the prescribed finger movement. We
ympathise with the point made by the reviewer that it can be difficult to consider a tracking task in
erms of target frequencies. In our manuscript, we have therefore altered the text explaining the target
waveform and emphasised that it was a stereotyped positional waveform (as shown in fig 1), after
which we explain its details in frequency domain as exemplified above (see line 103 - 111).
