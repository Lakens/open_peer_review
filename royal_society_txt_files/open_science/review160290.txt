I enjoyed reading this ms. It takes an unusual data set that was collected some years ago at a
whaling station and examines the seasonal changes in oil yield in humpback and sperm whales.
While there are issues with the way the data were collected, (they were collected by commercial
whalers), the authors do about as good a job as anyone could presenting the potential errors and
or biases. Further, given the likely error in the data some very interesting patterns come out.
First them make an interesting comparison between a capital breeder (humpback) and income
breeder (sperm whale). While the results are consistent with what one might expect, it is really
important to have empirical data to support our understanding. Finally, given that these data are
never likely to be collected again, it is important to get as much out of these archives as possible.
I have some rather minor suggestions, mostly clerical comments. I also have provided some
other references that the authors may or may not be aware of, but I think they should consider
including some of them, as they speak directly to the value of this approach. In particular the
book by Rice and Wolman, is one of the few reports where scientific whaling was carried out and
actual measurements of mass change and lipid content were made. (Appendix A.)

Irvine et al. look in depth at whale catch records from a land-based whaling station in Southern
Australia. The authors demonstrate that lipid stores vary not just by animal size, but also by
gender, reproductive state and, in humpbacks, by time of year in which they were caught. The
authors effectively take advantage of a historical record to elicit new and interesting results.
Overall the paper is well constructed, well-written, uses appropriate methodology and is easy to
follow. Generally the passages relating to sperm whales and the comparisons of sperm whales to
humpback whales are clear and concise.
Despite clear prose in each individual paragraph, however, the overall context of the results,
especially the seasonal findings of the humpback whale lipid yields, is hard to interpret. For
instance, it is not clear until it is alluded to close to the end of the discussion that the whaling
station is itself not on a breeding ground but only a quarter of the way from Antarctica to the
breeding ground. This fact makes a big difference in interpreting results and should be more
thoroughly described early in the manuscript since the proximity of the whaling station to the
feeding ground will not be apparent to most readers. If the results had come from a breeding
ground, then the observed results of increasing lipid stores as the season progressed would be
very surprising as they would be the opposite of what would be expected.
To read more clearly, I recommend a more hypothesis-driven approach to the introduction.
What would be expected of humpback whale lipid stores based on known life-history patterns
and how do the observed results compare? One framework that may be helpful would be
emphasizing throughout the humpback whale sections the known order of migration from the
literature and placing the results from the paper within the context of those results as they arise.
The biggest surprise when reading this paper was that the authors chose to emphasize as a key
takeaway what should be the most intuitively obvious result: that longer whales have more
stored lipids than shorter whales. The authors’ data is rife with other interesting nuggets,
including their observations regarding pregnant whales and the presence of seasonal differences
in humpback whale lipid stores when sperm whales do not demonstrate the same seasonality; a
greater emphasis on these results could increase the import and impact of the paper.
Finally, although I am not a GLMM expert, I found the lack of significance testing in the models
surprising. Many of the reported models are very similar (same R^2, hardly different AICs), yet
the authors report small differences (i.e. seasonal differences in Sperm whale models, monthly
differences in the slopes of the humpback whale male models). Are these small differences
statistically significant? Or could they likely be due to random effects? Many of the authors’
suggestions explaining these differences is that some small group of animals biased the results. If
such were the case, I would expect those differences to be non-statistically significant. Please
describe what objective criteria were used to determine whether a difference in models was small
but significant or small and insignificant.
General comments:
Throughout the manuscript, including the title, the authors refer to capital and income breeders.
These terms, however, are often applied mostly to reproducing females (e.g. Jonsson 1997). A
point should be made that male humpbacks demonstrate the same feast/fast seasonal life history
stages.
One of the more interesting results was the finding that humpbacks caught later in the season
had more lipids than humpbacks caught earlier in the season. Can this trend be more thoroughly
explored and perhaps matched to the expectation that whales on the feeding ground are
4
increasing in lipid stores by 1.5 barrels/week? Additional analyses to this effect could be a plot
of catch date vs lipid volume/foot, or mean lipid volume over time binned by length classes.
Similarly, the findings that the slopes of the regression relationships change over time is
interesting and not well discussed in the text. The explanation given, that the slope changes are
driven by a few whales of a certain class, is not well-supported. If the hypothesized outliers are
removed from the dataset, does the slope relationship change? Regardless, the manuscript would
be strengthened if a biological basis could be hypothesized that would explain the observed
results. Perhaps it points to the stability of lipids in larger organisms? Do they show less change
over time than smaller whales?
Do you foresee any potential bias in your results regarding what size class of whales were easier
to catch? Were healthier, more robust whales more likely to escape? Or more likely to be
targeted?
Finally - although I appreciate the novelty of archaic units - there seems to be no reason why
units were not all converted to SI units. For increased applicability, particularly of the regression
relationships, using SI units would be preferred.
Specific Comments:
Line 72,75,120: Awkward citations
77-79: has this variability based on measurement site been demonstrated in baleen whales as
well?
80-81: is this dataset publicly available or citable? Along with the publication of this work, the
authors may wish to make this dataset available as a supplement.
85: what other biological data was recorded?
96-98: hypotheses for these tests could be laid out here.
110: Do the authors suppose that sperm whales are absent during the peak humpback months?
Or were they not targeted because humpbacks were available? Can contemporary movement
patterns confirm one or the other idea?
112: From the length of the fetus, can pregnancy state of each pregnant female captured be
calculated? How would that data contribute to some of the lipid patterns noted?
115: Is there evidence in the literature for this assumption? How would it change results if not
true?
137: but is this dimorphism not accounted for in length? Are males also more robust/unit
length?
151: Would using length^3 affect any of the statistical significances of the results? It would
reduce the slopes of the regression equations.
182: What is the source for converting whale oil volume to mass? Is it not different in the two
species? Please cite.
195: Figure 3?
200-203: I am unconvinced by these explanations. The small whales seem to be a small % of the
total. Also, these points seem to belong more in discussion than results.
5
206: recommend using “larger” instead of “longer” for clarity as longer can also refer to time
scales
238: For this data set, describe the processing done at the station. Was the entire whale converted
to oil (supporting the author’s assertion that their measurements represent the total body lipid)?
Or was some set aside for meat?
260: when highlighting the usefulness of the dataset, point out future research that could
potentially be done with it.
269: Worth mentioning that R^2 is the same with or without seasonality, so the seasonal offset is
not that strong. Is it even a statistically significant difference?
297-298: Are these numbers adjusted for size class?
301-302: reiterate other drivers
305: lead the migration in which direction? Both? Discuss timing- the way it is described as
“middle of the herd” etc. makes the reader think it is a single formation.
308-309: How does this jive with the idea that lactating females need to build up energy stores?
310: worth reiterating that lactating females are a missing reproductive class from the data as they
were not targeted by whalers.
315-317: Besides asking the reader to count the dots in Figure 4, I did not see evidence presented
that larger whales arrive first. Can you make this explicit with a table or citing mean length by
catch date?
321-322: conflicts with earlier statement that immature males are at the beginning of the
migration.
322-324: this statement should be reconciled with the idea that better condition whales were
caught later in the season.
333-334: Would recommend binning data by size class and time and reporting means to better
make this point. Also- can the size of the fetus be used to report how near-term the pregnancies
were?
337: perhaps inappropriate citations here. Humpback whales have different foraging strategies
than elephant seals. Unless it has been shown that foraging success in humpback whales differs
by size, this line of reasoning is not supported
344: functionality?
345-352: could be explained in one sentence
364: and has a thermoregulatory purpose
374: 11% on average
375-376: Discuss implications that the slope of the length relationship is the same in both species.
Does it come from a base level of body fat in humpbacks- perhaps the lipid stores in the muscles?
6
383-385: this is the first mention in the paper that the sampling site is not itself a breeding locale,
but a stop along the northward migration route.
389-396: There are some missing pieces to this comparison that endanger its utility. Why was the
endpoint of 42.3 barrels in February chosen? If a whale leaves in late-April, how much lipid
would it be expected to lose before arriving at Cheynes Beach?
400: 15.6 would be an underestimate for whales at their maximum, but perhaps an overestimate
of whales at their minimum? Does your data and research support any estimate of yearly
minimum hw lipid stores? How would that compare to sperm whale averages?
Conclusion: Please summarize results in conclusion, not methods.

Comments to the Author:
This is a creative and potentially very useful study utilizing a historical data set to examine lipid
storage in humpback and sperm whales, and tie this to breeding strategies. However, it requires
substantial revision before it can be considered acceptable. In addition to the very useful
comments of the second referee (which the authors must address in a revision), I note a
potentially significant issue with the data set as it relates to the reliability of length frequencies
(see below). The authors need to look at this problem more closely than they have, and try to
assess whether it is a trivial issue or one which potentially compromises their analysis. A
suggestion for how to accomplish this is given below.
Line 50: I would not count seals among “the largest animals”. Reword.
Line 58: This should read “Many baleen whales, including humpbacks, move...” Predictable
seasonal movement between widely separated feeding and breeding grounds is not typical of all
species, and patterns of migration vary among taxa.
Lione 103: Remove the open parenthesis before “The humpback whale dataset”.
Line 106, 107, 168, 169: Replace “harvested” with “hunted”. The first word is a whaling industry
euphemism and should not be used (corn is harvested, whales are killed).
Lines 165 ff: The opening to results repeats information given in Methods. Pick a section in
which to retain these data and delete the duplicate text.
Lines 173 ff: The supposed occurrence of very few whales under 35 feet is potentially a problem.
These length data are almost certainly false to at least some extent. “Stretching” - reporting an
undersized whale as longer than it actually was to avoid an infraction of the minimum size
regulation - was common in the industry, and indeed Graeme Chittleborough got into some
trouble for raising this issue when he working at Australian whaling stations. Accordingly, the
use of the term “strict” on line 253 is inappropriate - there is good evidence for considerable
cheating in this regard at least in some whaling operations (see for example, Ivashchenko and
Clapham 2015, 2016 in press).
One way to look at whether this may be biasing your results to a significant extent is to
construct a histogram of length frequencies and see if there is a notable peak at or just above 35
feet; if there is, the data are unreliable, and I would recommend ignoring any lengths that depart
from a roughly normal distribution. This may mean re-running analyses.
Also, looking at individual records may be instructive: if many of your 35-foot animals look like
they have low oil yields, that would suggest that the animals concerned were actually smaller
than reported. (I note in passing that this was obvious in aggregate for Japanese catches of sperm
whales, because while the whalers were routinely falsifying length data they did not attempt to
change oil yield, with the result that - as was pointed out at the IWC in the 1960s - the average oil
production was abnormally low for the reported lengths).
The same problem potentially relates - even more so - to the sperm whales in the study, for
which the minimum length was 10.7 m for land stations (I don’t recall when this restriction went
into place; it might have been with the Convention, but it was certainly in effect by 1960).
The authors note the stretching problem in Discussion (lines 256-7) but do not attempt to assess
how much of an issue it is for their analysis. Showing length frequencies would help with this
issue.
Lines 361-2: Sperm whales are really not a “unique cetacean” in their deep diving. All ziphiids
share this characteristic, although the cranial anatomy is different.

This is a much improved version of the paper, and the authors have done an excellent job
restructuring the paper and including additional analyses to address the comments from myself
and other reviewers. Conclusions are generally solid and much more clearly described.
Implications for the results have been much more explicitly drawn out in the introduction and
conclusions. The regression equations and the species comparisons in particular should be useful
for future studies. Only some minor comments below.
General Comments:
The additional analysis done to determine if whalers had stretched the data is important.
However, it is not clear from your description why female sperm whales were excluded on the
basis of histogram examination but male humpbacks were not. There seems to be a similar
shoulder effect on the small side of the maximum in the plot. Perhaps different bin sizes would
more effectively show the effect you are talking about?
Interesting that month was not a significant effect on lipid density- perhaps suggests that whales
are leaving the feeding ground once they have reached an ideal size?
Specific Comments:
Title: Recommend linking breeding type with whale type (i.e. “Quantifying the energy stores of
capital breeding humpback whales and income breeding sperm whales using…”
Lines 57-59: Awkward sentence
Line 126: Perhaps rephrase: “median water depth when caught”
Line 142: check reference for nlme
Line 238: Fig. S1 does not include month data…
Line 269: Can you refer to a figure or table that shows this result about sperm whales?
Line 438-439, confusingly worded, sounds like you’re saying an individual increased lipid stores
on the northward migration.
Line 301, Line 451, etc.: Referring to “kl of energy” is not really accurate. Can describe as “Energy
required for migration was derived from 2.49 kl of body lipid” for example, or do a conversion
from lipid to energy in kJ.
Line 330-339: Consider moving to methods if appropriate
Is Figure 6 necessary? (same information is in figure 3?)
Or does Figure 3 include female sperm whales? (I thought they were excluded?)
Why are the two figures and equations slightly different? Captions suggest they should be the
same.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
This is an excellent paper which utilizes a unique data set, the like of which we’ll never see again.
The authors have done a very good job of addressing referee comments, and if they can deal with
a few relatively minor issues this will be ready for publication.
L 17. Abstract: include the dates for the humpback and sperm whale catches after “...records from
Western Australia”.
L 19. Abstract: include the sample sizes for each species.
L 99 ff. Intro and link to Discussion: I would like to see the authors restructure the Discussion to
specifically address the hypotheses they enumerate in the last para of the Introduction. For
example, in Discussion you would have a separate section headed “Hypothesis 1: mature, non-
pregnant females will have variable energy stores due to their varying reproductive states.”
(Discuss).
Methods: you bring this up much later, but there should be explicit mention in the Methods
section of two points: 1) that the humpbacks were taken on the northward migration, but not on
the southward as they returned to the Antarctic; and 2) that sperm whale oil yields included
spermaceti from the case (add “the implications of this are discussed later” or something similar).
L 123. Should read “data are” not “data is”.
L 177. I would reword this to say “...due to the temporally staggered migration of this
population.” The use of “segregation” implies that different classes were quite separate in their
migratory timing, and it isn’t that distinct.
L 201. Amend to “...minimum catch length set by the IWC, the regulatory body... etc”
L 330-339. This belongs in Methods, not here (though a brief reiteration of the point could be
made in Discussion)
L 342-3. The point about potential bias resulting from targeting large whales first is probably not
relevant, and certainly not for the latter years of this station when the population was highly
depleted by illegal whaling (notably for humpbacks). Presumably you can examine this by
looking at the length distribution over the course of the whaling period - was there a significant
difference in the mean or median lengths of animals in the early years? But given that you’re
17
looking here at oil yields by length, it shouldn’t matter if you had more large animals in earlier
years. Catch bias isn't going to affect the physical state of the whale.
L 408. Missing word: “due TO the energetic...”
Figure S1. Redo with the X axis clearly and completely labeled all the way across and a label
showing that (presumably) females are on the left and males on the right of each panel. Right
now we’re left to assume that the X axis values for males are the same as those for females.

Dear Andrew Dunn and Alice Power
Thank you for considering the manuscript Quantifying the energy stores of capital and income breeding
humpback and sperm whales using historical whaling records* (please note the slight change in title,
previously ‘The use of historical whaling records to contrast energy stores of capital and income breeding
humpback and sperm whales’) by Lyn G. Irvine, Michele Thums, Christine Hanson, Clive R. McMahon
and Mark A. Hindell.
As requested, we have conducted substantial revisions of the manuscript including the following:
• Additional analyses confirming the reliability of length frequencies (including the removal of a small
amount of suspect data), suggested by the associate editor
• Improved articulation of hypotheses and additional analyses to better address hypotheses, suggested
by reviewer 2
• Restructure and rewording of the discussion to emphasize the important and interesting ‘nuggets’
highlighted by reviewer 2
• Correction of the model criteria used, suggested by reviewer 2
• Slight change in title to mirror the modifications in the analyses and discussion
We feel the paper is much improved for these efforts. The comments from each reviewer are specifically
addressed below, and all changes to the document are cross-referenced with the line numbers indicated
in the manuscript. I hope you will find this revised version suitable for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
Yours sincerely,
Lyn Irvine
Associate Editor: 1
This is a creative and potentially very useful study utilizing a historical data set to examine lipid storage
in humpback and sperm whales, and tie this to breeding strategies. However, it requires substantial
revision before it can be considered acceptable. In addition to the very useful comments of the second
referee (which the authors must address in a revision), I note a potentially significant issue with the
data set as it relates to the reliability of length frequencies (see below). The authors need to look at this
problem more closely than they have, and try to assess whether it is a trivial issue or one which
potentially compromises their analysis. A suggestion for how to accomplish this is given below.
This length issue has now been addressed, as outlined in the ‘detailed comments’ section below.
Detailed comments:
• Line 50 (now line 53): I would not count seals among “the largest animals”. Reword.
- Reworded to “large animals” (line 53).
• Line 58 (now line 62): This should read “Many baleen whales, including humpbacks, move...”
Predictable seasonal movement between widely separated feeding and breeding grounds is not typical of
all species, and patterns of migration vary among taxa.
- Reworded accordingly. Sentence now reads “Many baleen whales, including humpbacks, move...” (line
62).
• Line 103: Remove the open parenthesis before “The humpback whale dataset”.
- Lines 103 – 111 are actually the first lines of the results section. It appears that these lines were
accidentally duplicated into the Materials and Methods section during the submission process. These
lines, including the open parenthesis, have now been removed from the Materials and Methods section.
• Line 106, 107, 168, 169 (Now lines 194, 195): Replace “harvested” with “hunted”. The first word is a
whaling industry euphemism and should not be used (corn is harvested, whales are killed).
removed due to the duplication noted above.
• Lines 165 ff: The opening to results repeats information given in Methods. Pick a section in which to
retain these data and delete the duplicate text.
- The duplicate text has been removed from the Materials and Methods section – please see comments
under Line 103
• Lines 173 ff: The supposed occurrence of very few whales under 35 feet is potentially a problem.
These length data are almost certainly false to at least some extent. “Stretching” - reporting an
undersized whale as longer than it actually was to avoid an infraction of the minimum size regulation -
was common in the industry, and indeed Graeme Chittleborough got into some trouble for raising this
issue when he working at Australian whaling stations. Accordingly, the use of the term “strict” on line
253 (now line 345) is inappropriate - there is good evidence for considerable cheating in this regard at
least in some whaling operations (see for example, Ivashchenko and Clapham 2015, 2016 in press).
- We have now examined the potential problem of “stretching” (see below). The word “strict” has been
removed accordingly (now line 345)
• One way to look at whether this may be biasing your results to a significant extent is to construct a
histogram of length frequencies and see if there is a notable peak at or just above 35 feet; if there is,
the data are unreliable, and I would recommend ignoring any lengths that depart from a roughly normal
distribution. This may mean re-running analyses.
• Also, looking at individual records may be instructive: if many of your 35-foot animals look like they
have low oil yields, that would suggest that the animals concerned were actually smaller than reported.
(I note in passing that this was obvious in aggregate for Japanese catches of sperm whales, because
while the whalers were routinely falsifying length data they did not attempt to change oil yield, with the
result that - as was pointed out at the IWC in the 1960s - the average oil production was abnormally low
for the reported lengths).
• The same problem potentially relates - even more so - to the sperm whales in the study, for which the
minimum length was 10.7 m for land stations (I don’t recall when this restriction went into place; it
might have been with the Convention, but it was certainly in effect by 1960).
• The authors note the stretching problem in Discussion (lines 256-7) but do not attempt to assess how
much of an issue it is for their analysis. Showing length frequencies would help with this issue.
- We have now made histograms of length for each species and class which are presented in the
supplementary material. It appears that stretching was an issue for female sperm whales (only), and
these have subsequently been deleted from the analysis; this is detailed in lines 130 - 135. Stretching
was not identified as an issue for any of the other categories analysed in the manuscript. The relevant
text reads “All data were checked for potential ‘stretching’, whereby whalers reported an undersized
whale as longer than the actual size to avoid an infraction of the minimum size regulation (35 feet or
10.7 m) [32, 38]. We did this by constructing histograms of length and assessing the distribution to see
if there was a notable peak around this minimum. Stretching was only identified for the female sperm
whale data, and this was subsequently excluded from the analysis (accounting for 4% of total sperm
whale data) (Figure S1)."
• Lines 361-2 (now line 316): Sperm whales are really not a “unique cetacean” in their deep diving. All
ziphiids share this characteristic, although the cranial anatomy is different.
- Wording in the text has been changed to “Sperm whales, in contrast, are specialised for deep diving.”
(Line 374)
Reviewer 1
I enjoyed reading this ms. It takes an unusual data set that was collected some years ago at a whaling
station and examines the seasonal changes in oil yield in humpback and sperm whales. While there are
issues with the way the data were collected, (they were collected by commercial whalers), the authors
do about as good a job as anyone could presenting the potential errors and or biases. Further, given the
likely error in the data some very interesting patterns come out. First them make an interesting
comparison between a capital breeder (humpback) and income breeder (sperm whale). While the results
are consistent with what one might expect, it is really important to have empirical data to support our
as much out of these archives as possible.
I have some rather minor suggestions, mostly clerical comments. I also have provided some other
references that the authors may or may not be aware of, but I think they should consider including
some of them, as they speak directly to the value of this approach. In particular the book by Rice and
Wolman, is one of the few reports where scientific whaling was carried out and actual measurements of
mass change and lipid content were made.
Thank you for suggesting these references. We have read all of the references suggested and included

Comments to the Author(s)
Irvine et al. look in depth at whale catch records from a land-based whaling station in Southern
Australia. The authors demonstrate that lipid stores vary not just by animal size, but also by gender,
reproductive state and, in humpbacks, by time of year in which they were caught. The authors
effectively take advantage of a historical record to elicit new and interesting results.
Overall the paper is well constructed, well-written, uses appropriate methodology and is easy to follow.
Generally the passages relating to sperm whales and the comparisons of sperm whales to humpback
whales are clear and concise.
Despite clear prose in each individual paragraph, however, the overall context of the results, especially
the seasonal findings of the humpback whale lipid yields, is hard to interpret. For instance, it is not clear
until it is alluded to close to the end of the discussion that the whaling station is itself not on a breeding
ground but only a quarter of the way from Antarctica to the breeding ground. This fact makes a big
difference in interpreting results and should be more thoroughly described early in the manuscript since
the proximity of the whaling station to the feeding ground will not be apparent to most readers. If the
results had come from a breeding ground, then the observed results of increasing lipid stores as the
season progressed would be very surprising as they would be the opposite of what would be expected.
In the introduction, we now make clear the position of the whaling station in reference to the breeding
grounds (Lines 87-89). We have also discussed differences in lipid stores found in previous studies in the
breeding grounds and how this relates to our findings (lines 437-461).
be expected of humpback whale lipid stores based on known life-history patterns and how do the
observed results compare? One framework that may be helpful would be emphasizing throughout the
humpback whale sections the known order of migration from the literature and placing the results from
the paper within the context of those results as they arise.
Thank you for this suggestion. We have now articulated hypotheses in relation to the energy demands of
each reproductive group and the time spent in the Antarctic feeding grounds (lines 109-117). We have
added some new analyses that model body lipid as a function of length and month of catch, for each
reproductive class, to more clearly test these hypotheses (lines 175-181). We have discussed the results
with reference to these new hypotheses in the discussion (Lines 414-461).
The biggest surprise when reading this paper was that the authors chose to emphasize as a key
takeaway what should be the most intuitively obvious result: that longer whales have more stored lipids
than shorter whales. The authors’ data is rife with other interesting nuggets, including their observations
regarding pregnant whales and the presence of seasonal differences in humpback whale lipid stores
when sperm whales do not demonstrate the same seasonality; a greater emphasis on these results
could increase the import and impact of the paper.
Thank you for this observation. We have restructured and reworded the manuscript throughout to
highlight the other ‘interesting nuggets’ as suggested.
Finally, although I am not a GLMM expert, I found the lack of significance testing in the models
surprising. Many of the reported models are very similar (same R^2, hardly different AICs), yet the
authors report small differences (i.e. seasonal differences in Sperm whale models, monthly differences in
the slopes of the humpback whale male models). Are these small differences statistically significant? Or
could they likely be due to random effects? Many of the authors’ suggestions explaining these
differences is that some small group of animals biased the results. If such were the case, I would expect
those differences to be non-statistically significant. Please describe what objective criteria were used to
determine whether a difference in models was small but significant or small and insignificant.
We initially assessed our models using the information theoretic approach which is based on strength of
evidence, rather than significance testing. This approach allows the generation of multiple alternative
hypotheses, rather than just one alternative hypothesis. We used Akaike’s Information Criteria, (AIC)
and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) weights to quantify and rank each hypotheses, rather than
using a P value to indicate significance.
We realised that the AIC was the incorrect criteria by which to rank the sperm whale models as the
sample size was so large (n = 1965) and AIC has a tendency to choose the most complex model. We
reanalysed the data using Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) and the top model no longer included
seasonality for the sperm whales. This agrees with your observation of similar R2 for the models that
included seasonality and those that did not.
In addition, we now also use Akaikes Information Criteria, corrected for small sample size, (AICc) to
rank all models, (instead of AIC) as the humpback whale dataset is much smaller than that for sperm
whales, particularly when each reproductive class is analysed separately (Table 4).
General comments:
Throughout the manuscript, including the title, the authors refer to capital and income breeders. These
terms, however, are often applied mostly to reproducing females (e.g. Jonsson 1997). A point should be
made that male humpbacks demonstrate the same feast/fast seasonal life history stages.
We have added text referring to the feast / fast cycle of the capital breeding life history into the
introduction (Lines 46-48).
One of the more interesting results was the finding that humpbacks caught later in the season had more
lipids than humpbacks caught earlier in the season. Can this trend be more thoroughly explored and
perhaps matched to the expectation that whales on the feeding ground are increasing in lipid stores by
1.5 barrels/week? Additional analyses to this effect could be a plot of catch date vs lipid volume/foot, or
mean lipid volume over time binned by length classes.
stores of each reproductive class with month of sampling (Lines 175-181; Table 4). The results of this
analysis are reported in Lines 228-239 and discussed in Lines 414-461.
Similarly, the findings that the slopes of the regression relationships change over time is interesting and
not well discussed in the text. The explanation given, that the slope changes are driven by a few whales
of a certain class, is not well-supported. If the hypothesized outliers are removed from the dataset, does
the slope relationship change? Regardless, the manuscript would be strengthened if a biological basis
could be hypothesized that would explain the observed results. Perhaps it points to the stability of lipids
in larger organisms? Do they show less change over time than smaller whales?
As above, we have now redone this analysis which has shown that the regression relationship changes
over time for the pregnant females only. We have hypothesized that this may be due to a combination
of delayed migration to maximise energy stores but limited energy storage capabilities and foraging
efficiency of the smaller pregnant females (Lines 429-432).
Do you foresee any potential bias in your results regarding what size class of whales were easier to
catch? Were healthier, more robust whales more likely to escape? Or more likely to be targeted?
We have mentioned in the discussion that the data set is biased by the largest whales being targeted
before the smaller whales and the size restrictions (minimum length 10.67m (35ft)) the whaling industry
operated under (Lines 342-343).
Finally - although I appreciate the novelty of archaic units - there seems to be no reason why units were
not all converted to SI units. For increased applicability, particularly of the regression relationships,
using SI units would be preferred.
All units have been converted to SI units - this includes all tables and figures plus values in text. Values
in the text list the SI units followed by the original units in brackets.
Specific Comments:
Line 72, 75, 120 (now lines 79, 85): Awkward citations
- Citations have been modified accordingly (lines 78 and 81; reference previously on line 120 has been
removed).
77-79 (now lines 82-84): has this variability based on measurement site been demonstrated in baleen
whales as well?
- This variability has in fact been demonstrated in baleen whales as well. Three appropriate references
have been added into the text (lines 82-84).
80-81 (now line 87): is this dataset publicly available or citable? Along with the publication of this work,
the authors may wish to make this dataset available as a supplement.
- This dataset was located, and is publicly available, at the Western Australian State Records Office
www.sro.wa.gov.au These contact details will be published in the manuscript.
85 (now line 92): what other biological data was recorded?
- Other biological information recorded consisted of the following: body length (recorded in feet), sex,
and foetus length and sex. This information is documented in the materials and methods section (lines
128 – 129) and we have also added “length and sex” into the introduction (line 92).
96-98 (now lines 105-117): hypotheses for these tests could be laid out here.
- Thank you for this suggestion. We have now articulated hypotheses for these tests in the introduction
(lines 105-117).
110: Do the authors suppose that sperm whales are absent during the peak humpback months? Or were
they not targeted because humpbacks were available? Can contemporary movement patterns confirm
one or the other idea?
- Sperm whale catches were influenced by the local availability of humpback whales during winter. This
information has been added to the text with the appropriate references (Lines 196-198).
112: From the length of the fetus, can pregnancy state of each pregnant female captured be calculated?
How would that data contribute to some of the lipid patterns noted?
- All pregnant females in this data set are near-term pregnant females (Chittleborough 1965)
115: Is there evidence in the literature for this assumption? How would it change results if not true?
- We have not been able to find any information regarding this in the literature. However oil production
figures from Durban demonstrated that 11% of the total oil extracted from sperm whales was
spermaceti oil (Clarke 1978), and thus the assumption is unnecessary. We have removed the
assumption from the Materials and Methods section (line 106-111) and have instead discussed the
different oils in the sperm whale more completely in the discussion (lines 303-310).
137: but is this dimorphism not accounted for in length? Are males also more robust/unit length?
- Female sperm whales have now been removed from the analysis due to their unreliable length
measurements, so this comment is no longer valid.
151: Would using length^3 affect any of the statistical significances of the results? It would reduce the
slopes of the regression equations.
- This comment is no longer valid as the section has been removed.
182 (now line 212): What is the source for converting whale oil volume to mass? Is it not different in the
two species? Please cite.
- We have realised that converting volume to mass is problematic with sperm whale oil yield as sperm
whales have different types of oils in the body which were not separated during the extraction process.
As the proportion of each of these different oils was not recorded, a volume to mass conversion is not
possible - hence lipid mass has been deleted from the text (now line 212). We have instead expressed
the higher humpback whale lipid volume as a percentage over that of sperm whales.
195: Figure 3?
- The text referring to this figure has now been removed due to the new analyses that have been added
to the manuscript.
200-203: I am unconvinced by these explanations. The small whales seem to be a small % of the total.
Also, these points seem to belong more in discussion than results.
- We have added a new set of analyses into the manuscript and these previous lines have been deleted
from the text.
206: recommend using “larger” instead of “longer” for clarity as longer can also refer to time scales
- This line has been deleted due to the new analyses, but in the text in general, we have chosen to use
‘longer’ rather than ‘larger’ as larger could also be interpreted as fatter. We wanted to avoid any
confusion between length and girth.
238: For this data set, describe the processing done at the station. Was the entire whale converted to oil
(supporting the author’s assertion that their measurements represent the total body lipid)? Or was some
set aside for meat?
- A statement of the processing carried out at Cheynes Beach Whaling Station has been added to the
introduction (lines 91-93) including a footnote to support the statement. The wording added to the text
reads as follows: “This whaling station, located on the south coast of Western Australia about halfway
along the migratory corridor (31), extracted oil from the entire carcass , thus providing information on
total body lipid”. A more detailed description of the extraction process is given in the discussion (Lines
was a two-step process carried out in large digesters: firstly, the carcass was flensed and oil extracted
from the blubber and placed in a settling tank; the remainder of the body was then sawn into pieces and
rendered for oil extraction from the muscle, bones and viscera . Once the oil was recovered and placed
in the settling tank, meat meal and whale solubles were produced from the remaining residue [57]. Raw
products such as whale meat were not produced at the Cheynes Beach Whaling Station [57]”.
260: when highlighting the usefulness of the dataset, point out future research that could potentially be
done with it.
- We had already mentioned the usefulness of the data for bioenergetics modelling in the abstract (lines
32-34), and have now also added it to the discussion (lines 256-259) and conclusion (lines 474-476).
The following text has been added to the discussion “Importantly, we developed equations describing
the relationship between body lipid and length that can be used both for bioenergetics modelling (e.g.
[49-51]) and for predicting body lipid in the extensive historical whaling data sets held by the
International Whaling Commission [52], which typically include data on length and sex but not body
lipid.” The following text has been added to the conclusion “…and the relationships we have quantified
will be useful in bioenergetics modelling and in understanding the potential impacts of environmental
change”.
269: Worth mentioning that R^2 is the same with or without seasonality, so the seasonal offset is not
that strong. Is it even a statistically significant difference?
- Our new analysis that uses BIC, rather than AIC, to rank the models illustrates that seasonality is not
included in the top model. The results (lines 242-243) and discussion (lines 357-362) have been
modified accordingly.
297-298: Are these numbers adjusted for size class?
- These numbers were not adjusted for size, but we have now modified this accordingly and made it
clear in the results section (lines 224 – 226). The text now reads “Pregnant female humpback whales
stored up to twice as much body lipid as other whales of the same body length (Figure 4), and on
average stored 26.2% and 37.4% more body lipid (per metre) than non-pregnant females and mature
males respectively (Table 1).”
301-302: reiterate other drivers
- This comment related to reiterating the drivers of variability in energy stores. Our discussion has been
reworded markedly to match the new hypotheses and analyses. These lines are no longer in the text but
we now discuss in detail the effect of sampling date on the variation in energy stores (lines 414-461).
305: lead the migration in which direction? Both? Discuss timing- the way it is described as “middle of
the herd” etc. makes the reader think it is a single formation.
- As stated above, the discussion has been almost completely re-written to match the new hypotheses
and analyses that we have added to the manuscript. These new analyses have demonstrated individual
variability within each reproductive class and consequently we have taken emphasis away from the
migration timing and put more emphasis on individual variation. This is now expressed as variability in
residency times in the Antarctic, rather than migration timing as it is more relevant to effects on energy
stores (lines 414-461).
308-309: How does this jive with the idea that lactating females need to build up energy stores?
- It is interesting that the lactating females, those with the highest energy demands, stay in the feeding
grounds for the least amount of time. This is presumably to minimise the time their calves are exposed
to the cold Antarctic waters. This has been added to the text and now reads “Lactating females are a
very interesting reproductive group as they have the highest energetic costs [14, 16], but the shortest
duration in the Antarctic feeding grounds [37]. As this is energetically detrimental to the mothers [17,
18, 23, 65], it has been suggested that limiting the time in the Antarctic feeding grounds must be
advantageous for the dependent calves, presumably by minimising their exposure to the cold Antarctic
waters [37]” (lines 399-403).
were not targeted by whalers.
- This has been reiterated in the text and now reads “It must be noted here that lactating females are a
missing reproductive class from this dataset, due to their protection under whaling industry regulations
[48], and thus the variation we found would have been even larger if lactating females were sampled”
(lines 396-399).
315-317: Besides asking the reader to count the dots in Figure 4, I did not see evidence presented that
larger whales arrive first. Can you make this explicit with a table or citing mean length by catch date?
- This part of the discussion has been removed as we no longer refer to migration timing, according to
reproductive class, in the discussion as the variability we found with the new analysis was individual
variation within each reproductive class.
321-322: conflicts with earlier statement that immature males are at the beginning of the migration.
- This part of the discussion has been removed for the reasons outlined above.
322-324: this statement should be reconciled with the idea that better condition whales were caught
later in the season.
- This part of the discussion has been removed for the reasons outlined above.
333-334: Would recommend binning data by size class and time and reporting means to better make
this point. Also- can the size of the fetus be used to report how near-term the pregnancies were?
- To address this, we have added an analysis to investigate the variation in energy stores according to
length and month of catch (lines 175-181) and have reported mean energy stores/unit body length for
June and July for the pregnant females. As above, all pregnant females in this dataset are near-term
(Chittleborough 1965).
337: perhaps inappropriate citations here. Humpback whales have different foraging strategies than
elephant seals. Unless it has been shown that foraging success in humpback whales differs by size, this
line of reasoning is not supported
- Thank you for pointing this out. We have changed the reference to one that refers to allometric
foraging efficiency of baleen whales (Goldbogen et al. 2010; line 432).
344 (now line 373): functionality?
- Functionality has been changed to ‘lipid storage’ to be more specific (line 313-314).
345-352: could be explained in one sentence
- The discussion has been modified substantially and these lines have been removed completely
364 (now line 315): and has a thermoregulatory purpose
- The thermoregulatory role has been added into the sentence – it now reads “Their blubber plays a role
in thermoregulation, but is primarily an energy storage depot [21, 28]” (line 315).
374 (now lines 307-08): 11% on average
- This has been added to the text. Text now reads “Given that an average of 11% of the total oil
produced from a sperm whale is spermaceti oil…” (lines 307-308)
375-376: Discuss implications that the slope of the length relationship is the same in both species. Does
it come from a base level of body fat in humpbacks- perhaps the lipid stores in the muscles?
- We have now discussed this in terms of energy required for the humpback migration (lines 262-266),
including implications for different size classes of humpback whales.
383-385: this is the first mention in the paper that the sampling site is not itself a breeding locale, but a
stop along the northward migration route.
- A description of the location of the whaling station along the migratory corridor has now been added to
the introduction (lines 88-89) “This whaling station, located about halfway along the migratory corridor
of the Breeding Stock D (BSD) humpback whales…” It is also further elaborated on the discussion with
the following text: “More specifically, the sampling location (Cheynes Beach Whaling Station) is located
approximately 3000 km north of the BSD feeding grounds …” (lines 272-273).
389-396 (now lines 285-293): There are some missing pieces to this comparison that endanger its
utility. Why was the endpoint of 42.3 barrels in February chosen? If a whale leaves in late-April, how
much lipid would it be expected to lose before arriving at Cheynes Beach?
- February was the last sampling date in the Antarctic feeding grounds and was thus chosen as the value
to extrapolate on. The text has been reworded to explain this more clearly (285-293).
400 (now lines 268-282): 15.6 would be an underestimate for whales at their maximum, but perhaps an
overestimate of whales at their minimum? Does your data and research support any estimate of yearly
minimum hw lipid stores? How would that compare to sperm whale averages?
- Our data does not give any indication of humpback oil yields at their minimum as they were sampled
during their northern migration only, however we have added the following text to elaborate on this
point “As the energy stores of the BSD humpback whales decline through the breeding season [32], and
those of sperm whales are stable throughout the year (demonstrated in this study), the body lipid
difference we found between the two species (2.49 kl) is likely an underestimate of the difference that
would be expected when the humpbacks depart their feeding grounds, carrying maximum energy stores.
More specifically, the sampling location (Cheynes Beach Whaling Station) is located approximately 3000
km north of the BSD feeding grounds [32] and, contrary to that observed in some other humpback
whale populations [53], there is no evidence of feeding along the migration path. The energy difference
at the beginning of the migration should decrease continually throughout the season [32], until the
humpback whales return to their feeding grounds and resume foraging. We suggest that by the time the
humpback whales return to their Antarctic feeding grounds and resume foraging, the energy difference
between humpback and sperm whales may be much smaller and possibly even close to zero.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to investigate the energy stores of humpback whales on the return
journey to their feeding grounds, as they do not pass Cheynes Beach Whaling Station on their
southward migration, and oil yields of individuals were not recorded at the other whaling stations along
the Western Australian coast [32]” (lines 268-282).
Conclusion: Please summarize results in conclusion, not methods.
- We have reworded the conclusion to include more detail about our results. The conclusion now reads
“Quantifying the body condition of large marine mammals is not straightforward and is rarely possible
given the difficulties of measuring animals directly. Using the unique data set data from Cheynes Beach
Whaling Station we demonstrate that capital breeding humpback whales store substantially more body
lipid than income breeding sperm whales to fuel their annual migration. Although consistent with
expectations, we were able to provide the first quantification of the additional lipid stores required by
humpback whale males during their breeding fast, and also those of breeding females who must satisfy
the high energy demands of gestation and lactation. If these additional energy stores cannot be
accumulated in the Antarctic feeding grounds, completion of the annual migration, including all
reproductive activities, may be compromised as there are limited feeding opportunities along the
migratory route. This could affect all components of the population, but particularly the smaller breeding
females who are most vulnerable to nutritional stress during the migration. Our study has provided new
insights into the life history strategies of large cetaceans, and the relationships we have quantified will
be useful in bioenergetics modelling and in understanding the potential impacts of environmental
change.”
Response to referees: RSOS-160290 - Irvine et al - The use of historical whaling records to contrast
energy stores of capital and income breeding humpback and sperm whales
We thank the Associate editor and reviewer for their time and constructive comments on the
manuscript. We have completed the revisions suggestions for the manuscript and have added a few
additional minor adjustments to the text to improve clarity and readability. We feel the paper is now
ready for publication. Please see below for our responses to the reviews and the modifications that
we have made.
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
This is an excellent paper which utilizes a unique data set, the like of which we’ll never see again.
The authors have done a very good job of addressing referee comments, and if they can deal with
a few relatively minor issues this will be ready for publication.
<U+F0B7> L 17. Abstract: include the dates for the humpback and sperm whale catches after
“...records from Western Australia”.
- Dates have been added accordingly. Text now reads “Using a unique set of historical whaling
records from Western Australia (1952 – 1963)… (Line 18).
<U+F0B7> L 19. Abstract: include the sample sizes for each species.
- Sample sizes have been added accordingly. Text now reads “… quantified the relationship
between total body lipid and length for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (n = 905)
and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) (n = 1961). (Lines 20-21)
<U+F0B7> L 99 ff. Intro and link to Discussion: I would like to see the authors restructure the
Discussion to specifically address the hypotheses they enumerate in the last para of the
Introduction. For example, in Discussion you would have a separate section headed
“Hypothesis 1: mature, non-pregnant females will have variable energy stores due to their
varying reproductive states.” (Discuss).
- The discussion has been re-structured with the appropriate headings (Lines 401ff). Additional
text has been added to these sections to elaborate on each hypothesis separately.
<U+F0B7> Methods: you bring this up much later, but there should be explicit mention in the
Methods section of two points: 1) that the humpbacks were taken on the northward
migration, but not on the southward as they returned to the Antarctic; and 2) that sperm
whale oil yields included spermaceti from the case (add “the implications of this are
discussed later” or something similar).
- Appropriate text has been added into the methods section. The text reads as follows:
1) “All humpbacks were caught on their northward migration between the Antarctic feeding
grounds and lower latitude breeding grounds as this population does not pass Cheynes Beach
Whaling Station on their return journey to Antarctic waters [32]” (Lines 130 - 132); and
2) “Due to this extraction process, the oil yields for sperm whales included sperm oil from the
body as well as spermaceti oil from the spermaceti organ. The implications of this are discussed
in a later section.” (Lines 154 - 156).
<U+F0B7> L 123. Should read “data are” not “data is”.
- We could not find this text in the manuscript
<U+F0B7> L 177. I would reword this to say “...due to the temporally staggered migration of this
population.” The use of “segregation” implies that different classes were quite separate in
their migratory timing, and it isn’t that distinct.
- Reworded accordingly. Text now reads: “We analysed each reproductive class separately due
to the temporally staggered migration of this population” (Line 198 - 199).
<U+F0B7> L 201. Amend to “...minimum catch length set by the IWC, the regulatory body... etc”
- Sentence has been amended accordingly. Text now reads “… minimum catch length set by the
International Whaling Commission (IWC), the regulatory body for the commercial whaling
industry.” (Lines 221-222).
<U+F0B7> L 330-339. This belongs in Methods, not here (though a brief reiteration of the point could
be made in Discussion)
- These lines have now been moved into the methods section (Lines 148-156).
<U+F0B7> L 342-3. The point about potential bias resulting from targeting large whales first is
probably not relevant, and certainly not for the latter years of this station when the
population was highly depleted by illegal whaling (notably for humpbacks). Presumably
you can examine this by looking at the length distribution over the course of the whaling
period - was there a significant difference in the mean or median lengths of animals in the
early years? But given that you’re looking here at oil yields by length, it shouldn’t matter
if you had more large animals in earlier years. Catch bias isn't going to affect the physical
state of the whale.
- The text has been removed accordingly.
<U+F0B7> L 408. Missing word: “due TO the energetic...”
- Thank you for pointing this out. The word “to” has been added to the sentence which now
reads: “… have greater energy demands than adults due to the energetic costs of body
growth…” (Line 429).
<U+F0B7> Figure S1. Redo with the X axis clearly and completely labelled all the way across and a
label showing that (presumably) females are on the left and males on the right of each
panel. Right now we’re left to assume that the X axis values for males are the same as
those for females.
- This figure has been redone accordingly.
Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a much improved version of the paper, and the authors have done an excellent job
restructuring the paper and including additional analyses to address the comments from myself
and other reviewers. Conclusions are generally solid and much more clearly described.
Implications for the results have been much more explicitly drawn out in the introduction and
for future studies. Only some minor comments below.
General Comments:
<U+F0B7> The additional analysis done to determine if whalers had stretched the data is important.
However, it is not clear from your description why female sperm whales were excluded on
the basis of histogram examination but male humpbacks were not. There seems to be a
similar shoulder effect on the small side of the maximum in the plot. Perhaps different bin
sizes would more effectively show the effect you are talking about?
- The female sperm whale were removed from the analysis as there was a clear spike in numbers
in the 35-36ft size class. In fact the majority of the female sperm whales were in this size
category. As you have observed, there does appear to be a small shoulder effect in the 35-36ft
size category in the male humpback whales, suggesting that some of the whales may have been
“stretched”. However, we have judged that this number is a small percentage of the dataset
and that it would have negligible effect on the analysis. The distribution generally fits a normal
distribution and as such, we have judged the size data to be usable. We have redone the plots
to show the distribution more clearly. The plots now have two “x” axes: the top axis is scaled in
feet (ft) (consistent with the measurements of the original data and thus not confounded by
rounding during conversion to meters); the bottom axis is scaled in meters (SI units) (Figure S1 in
appendix S2).
<U+F0B7> Interesting that month was not a significant effect on lipid density- perhaps suggests that
whales are leaving the feeding ground once they have reached an ideal size?
- Good point – thank you for pointing this out. We have included this in the discussion, with
particular focus on the males (Lines 422-424).
Specific Comments:
<U+F0B7> Title: Recommend linking breeding type with whale type (i.e. “Quantifying the energy
stores of capital breeding humpback whales and income breeding sperm whales using…”
- Reworded title accordingly. Title now reads “Quantifying the energy stores of capital breeding
humpback whales and income breeding sperm whales using historical whaling records”.
<U+F0B7> Lines 57-59: Awkward sentence
- Sentence has been reworded accordingly. Text now reads “However in practice, this large
body size combined with their marine existence prevents capture for measurement, making
quantification of cetacean energy stores extremely difficult. (Lines 57-59).
<U+F0B7> Line 126: Perhaps rephrase: “median water depth when caught”
- Sentence has been rephrased. Text now reads “i) Humpback whales were captured over the
continental shelf, in waters generally < 50 m deep (median = 13 m), while sperm whales were
captured over the continental slope in waters generally 200 - 3000 m deep (median = 1067 m)
(Figure 1).” (Lines 125 - 127).
<U+F0B7> Line 142: check reference for nlme
- Thank you for pointing out this mistake. The text now cites the correct reference (Pinheiro et
al. 2013). (Line 163).
<U+F0B7> Line 238: Fig. S1 does not include month data…
- Thank you for pointing this out. The text now refers to the correct figure (Figure S2 in appendix
S2). (Line 258).
- We have now cited Table 5 in the appropriate text. (Line 291).
<U+F0B7> Line 438-439, confusingly worded, sounds like you’re saying an individual increased lipid
stores on the northward migration.
- This entire section has been reworded to improve clarity. (Lines 449ff).
<U+F0B7> Line 301, Line 451, etc.: Referring to “kl of energy” is not really accurate. Can describe as
“Energy required for migration was derived from 2.49 kl of body lipid” for example, or do a
conversion from lipid to energy in kJ.
- Sentences have been rephrased accordingly. The text now reads: “…the energy required for
the annual humpback whale migration is likely to be derived from at least 2.49 kl of body lipid.”
(Line 322-323); “Given that humpback whales accrue 200 l of body lipid per week in the feeding
grounds…” (Line 453).
<U+F0B7> Line 330-339: Consider moving to methods if appropriate
- These lines have now been moved into the methods section (lines 148 -156).
<U+F0B7> Is Figure 6 necessary? (same information is in figure 3?) Or does Figure 3 include female
sperm whales? (I thought they were excluded?) Why are the two figures and equations
slightly different? Captions suggest they should be the same.
- Figure 6 contains the full dataset for the male sperm whales while Figure 3 illustrates a
truncated data set. The sperm whale dataset needed to be truncated to match the length data
of the male humpback whales, in order to meet the assumptions of the model being fitted. This
was previously stated in the text (lines 265 - 267). We have now also made this clear in the
captions for both figure 3 and figure 6.
