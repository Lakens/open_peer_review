This is an exciting paper as it examines the neurological infrastructure of the visual system of the
rare giant squid
A long standing problem in the study of these deep water animals is that one must base
conclusions on very few specimen. However, there is no way around it.
Over all the methodology is well suited for the question asked and the conclusions are based in
the results. Yes, one may ask the questions- how large is too large? And are proportions always
needed?
But this is not in the scope of this paper nor should it be.

ppendix A
e topic of this paper will be of great general interest in biology as well as many
er disciplines and to the general public since this is an iconic animal for which
y little actual data exist.
reover, this is a very rare opportunity to have received fresh material for
entific analysis - there are few areas in the world where this could occur and the
wanese scientific team have taken good advantage of this serendipitous nearby
ding of Architeuthis.
is is a novel anatomical study that improves our knowledge of the enigmatic
nt squid. The idea of measuring the volume and density of the optic lobe
dulla and cortex with two other well-known and studied cephalopods is a good
e.
elieve there are several ways the ms could be improved. The main distraction in
ms are the two “hypotheses.” Both should be deleted in favor of simple
larative sentences that state what the finding is. As presented, these
ypotheses” seem as if they were concocted ex post facto and that weakens the
per.
e first hypothesis - Line 57 in the abstract - is rather banal; after all, where else
uld one expect visual info to be processed?
e second hypothesis - Line 208 in discussion - need not be invoked; there are
ually two items hypothesized there: that large eyes have well developed
cessing; and that they are probably used to detect predators at far distances. The
t is rather self evident, and the second has been developed by previous authors
d this present paper does not support such an optical effect. Moreover, this
pothesis is different from the one in the abstract. Best to delete this hypothesis
gle - the morphological study presented here tells an interesting story on its own.
e anatomical analysis here is adequate given that the squid was caught at sea and
on ice for quite a while (6 hrs); that is, there were not scientists on board the
hing vessel who could dissect and properly fix the freshest tissue with correct
micals. Thus there is no opportunity to do EM work, silver staining, etc. Using
omparative basis to look at size/volume of these brain parts was clever and
ful as compared to the nearshore species - no one has used MRI scanning and
reconstruction of specific brain parts of cephs before (at least as far as I know).
SULTS
1- Slightly odd statement because the white body does more than hold the
ball in place. It is a hematopoietic organ (this is mentioned in discussion - altho
hors should cite the paper by M Claus on this.).
0, 203 - authors have a good approach to compare to well known other cephs but
d a more thorough and convincing comparison. They could/ should talk up the
histication of oval squid and cuttlefish brain and behavior - readers will not be
e to appreciate how visually well endowed they are unless you spell it out a bit.
SCUSSION
2 - Begin a new paragraph with “The medulla of the optic lobe …” because this
seminal feature of this paper.
8 - [this point about hypotheses has already been cited above in this review]. A
estion that arises is how the authors can make the leap from saying cortex/
dulla ratio is different but that it helps better detection properties? This is too
culative to go from form (anatomy) to function (visual perception and
havioral action). This needs to be soft-pedaled.
3 - “living in poor light.” …. rather say “living in dim light from
luminescence for most of their life cycle.” After all, these squids may live in
hted environments for the first portion of their life cycle and this relatively small
cimen was captured in 20m water !
erall, the ms would benefit from general tightening up to make the key points
re clear and concise. Also, I notice that the captions are sometimes redundant
h the text.
ure 2B - what size scale is the bar?
summary, I find this to be a very interesting paper and a firm contribution to the
logy of the giant squid in particular, and deep-sea biology and general.

Review #1
This is an exciting paper as it examines the neurological infrastructure of the visual
system of the rare giant squid A long standing problem in the study of these deep
water animals is that one must base conclusions on very few specimen. However,
there is no way around it. Over all the methodology is well suited for the question
asked and the conclusions are based in the results. Yes, one may ask the questions-
how large is too large? And are proportions always needed? But this is not in the
scope of this paper nor should it be.
Reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s supportive view. Indeed, whether the size of optic
lobe has to be proportionally to the size of the eye in cephalopods is an interesting
question. We don’t have evidence to support or against it, thus we leave it open
without any speculation.
Review #2
The topic of this paper will be of great general interest in biology as well as many
other disciplines and to the general public since this is an iconic animal for which
very little actual data exist. Moreover, this is a very rare opportunity to have received
fresh material for scientific analysis - there are few areas in the world where this
could occur and the Taiwanese scientific team have taken good advantage of this
serendipitous nearby landing of Architeuthis. This is a novel anatomical study that
improves our knowledge of the enigmatic giant squid. The idea of measuring the
volume and density of the optic lobe medulla and cortex with two other well-known
and studied cephalopods is a good one.
Reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s support and encouragement.
I believe there are several ways the ms could be improved. The main distraction in the
ms are the two “hypotheses.” Both should be deleted in favor of simple declarative
sentences that state what the finding is. As presented, these “hypotheses” seem as if
they were concocted ex post facto and that weakens the paper. The first hypothesis -
Line 57 in the abstract - is rather banal; after all, where else would one expect visual
info to be processed? The second hypothesis - Line 208 in discussion - need not be
invoked; there are actually two items hypothesized there: that large eyes have well
developed processing; and that they are probably used to detect predators at far
distances. The first is rather self evident, and the second has been developed by
previous authors and this present paper does not support such an optical effect.
Moreover, this hypothesis is different from the one in the abstract. Best to delete this
hypothesis angle - the morphological study presented here tells an interesting story on
its own.
Reply: We agree with the reviewer that these hypotheses are not necessary in the
manuscript. We have removed both of them in the Abstract and Discussion.
The anatomical analysis here is adequate given that the squid was caught at sea and
put on ice for quite a while (6 hrs); that is, there were not scientists on board the
fishing vessel who could dissect and properly fix the freshest tissue with correct
chemicals. Thus there is no opportunity to do EM work, silver staining, etc. Using a
comparative basis to look at size/volume of these brain parts was clever and useful as
compared to the nearshore species - no one has used MRI scanning and 3D
reconstruction of specific brain parts of cephs before (at least as far as I know).
Reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s appreciation of our approach.
RESULTS 151- Slightly odd statement because the white body does more than hold
the eyeball in place. It is a hematopoietic organ (this is mentioned in discussion - altho
authors should cite the paper by M Claus on this.).
Reply: We have added “the white body is a hematopoietic organ” in this sentence. We
have also cited the paper by MF Claes (Functional morphology of the white bodies of
the cephalopod mollusc Sepia officinalis) in this section and Discussion.
160, 203 - authors have a good approach to compare to well known other cephs but
need a more thorough and convincing comparison. They could/ should talk up the
sophistication of oval squid and cuttlefish brain and behavior - readers will not be able
to appreciate how visually well endowed they are unless you spell it out a bit.
Reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s reminder. We have added a few words in this section
to emphasize the sophistication of oval squid and cuttlefish brain and behavior. It now
reads “These morphological features in the optic lobe of the giant squid are more
pronounced when compared with other two shallow water cephalopod species, oval
squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana and cuttlefish Sepia pharaonis, whose dynamic body
patterning for communication and camouflage is sophisticated [24]”.
DISCUSSION
202 - Begin a new paragraph with “The medulla of the optic lobe …” because this is a
seminal feature of this paper.
Reply: Done.
208 - [this point about hypotheses has already been cited above in this review]. A
question that arises is how the authors can make the leap from saying cortex/ medulla
ratio is different but that it helps better detection properties? This is too speculative to
go from form (anatomy) to function (visual perception and behavioral action). This
needs to be soft-pedaled.
Reply: Agree. We have removed this hypothesis in the Discussion.
213 - “living in poor light.” …. rather say “living in dim light from bioluminescence
for most of their life cycle.” After all, these squids may live in lighted environments
for the first portion of their life cycle and this relatively small specimen was captured
in 20m water !
Reply: We have modified this sentence according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
Overall, the ms would benefit from general tightening up to make the key points more
clear and concise. Also, I notice that the captions are sometimes redundant with the
text.
Reply: We have revised this manuscript slightly to make the key points more clear
and concise. For the captions, we aimed to make each figure standalone, thus some
redundancy with the text is necessary. We hope the reviewer and editor allow us to
keep these wordings. Thanks.
Figure 2B - what size scale is the bar?
Reply: Scale bar, 1 cm. We have added this info in the figure legend.
In summary, I find this to be a very interesting paper and a firm contribution to the
biology of the giant squid in particular, and deep-sea biology and general.
Reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s praise.
