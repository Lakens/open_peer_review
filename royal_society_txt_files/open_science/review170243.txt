label_comment_1
Thank you for asking me to review this paper. I’ll begin by noting that it was more difficult to
evaluate than it should have been because Figure 1 is missing from the PDF. Putting that to one
side, I think it will be a useful contribution to the literature, but it’s not quite ready for
publication yet. I have four main concerns:
1) The psychological stress hypothesis is not adequately developed at the moment. In particular, I
think the author needs to specify a mechanistic link between psychological stress and cravings.
It’s not immediately obvious why the former should lead to the latter. At the moment, it seems
plausible that psychological stress and cravings are associated because of a third, unmeasured
variable. Consequently, I think the author needs to clarify the logic of the hypothesis. In addition,
I think it is a mistake to set up the psychological stress hypothesis in opposition to evolutionary
explanations. I think it would be better for the author to rephrase the psychological stress
hypothesis in evolutionary terms, and to alter the title too.
2) I’m also not convinced by the author’s test of the psychological stress hypothesis. I don’t think
it’s adequate to simply posit that psychological stress prompts cravings. The cravings clearly
aren’t random, so the total number of cravings and the presence/absence of cravings are less
important than the pattern of cravings. So, I think the author needs to outline what the
psychological stress hypothesis predicts vis-à-vis pattern of cravings, and then test that
prediction. That is, she needs to make the test of the psychological stress hypothesis more like the
test of the first two hypotheses.
3) The last point also holds for the resource scarcity hypothesis. Again, because the cravings
aren’t random, the total number of cravings and the presence/absence of cravings is less
important than the pattern of cravings. As before, the key question is, what are the predictions of
the resource scarcity hypothesis for the pattern of cravings?
4) I’m concerned that the test of the resource scarcity hypothesis is confounded by the nature of
some of the items craved. The author discounted the hypothesis because the items with the
highest calories were not preferentially selected. However, the items in question—fish curry and
biriyani—are normally prepared with strongly-flavored spices, and there is reason to expect
pregnant women to develop aversions to strong-tasting plant foods. Such flavours often indicate
the presence of chemicals produced by plants as a deterrent against consumption by other
organism, i.e. toxic chemicals (Flaxman and Sherman, 2000). Thus, the expectation that fish curry
and biriyani should be craved more than mango and tamarind may not be reasonable. With this
in mind, I think the analysis needs to be redone after incorporating a control for the presence of
potentially toxic chemicals.
I also have a minor suggestion, which is that it would be really helpful for the author to include a
table that summarizes the variables included in each model. Backing out the details of the models
from the text is not straightforward, so a summary table would really help for the reader.

Introduction
Page 2:
„The aim of the present study is…“ should be „The aim of the present study was“ as past tense
should be used when describing what was done.
Page 4:
The statement “In Western societies, cravings and gestational weight gain are interrelated.”
requires a citation, maybe Orloff et al. (2016). Food cravings in pregnancy: Preliminary evidence
for a role in excess gestational weight gain. Appetite.
Methods
Page 7:
“Since” should not be used in the sense of “as” or “because” to avoid confusion.
Page 8:
I don’t see why the variables names “cravings_total”, “cravingsYN”, “unripe_mangoYN”, etc. are
necessary. While the information how the dichotomous variables were coded is relevant to the
reader, the information how the variable names were in your data file is irrelevant. Furthermore,
the variables names are not used in the present manuscript (except in Table 1, where they can
also be deleted), so it is not necessary to introduce them anyway.
Results
Page 10:
“Pregnant women were on average age of 23.29”: maybe it should read “pregnant women had an
average age of 23.29 years”?
“had completed an average 9.20 years of school”: maybe it should read “had completed an
average of 9.20 years of school”?

Page 11:
“The correlation … was inversely, but weakly correlated” is nonsensical.
“calories per serving of craved foods were positively, but weakly correlated”: with what? What
was the other variable?
“unripe mango was positively and weakly correlated with months pregnant”: what is “unripe
mango”? should it read “the number of cravings for unripe mango”?
In the second paragraph, several correlations are described as “weak”. However, all p-values are
> .42. That is, none of these correlations are statistically significant. Thus, it should read that all
these variables were uncorrelated and not that they were weakly correlated.
Reference to Table 1 in the third paragraph should probably read “Table 2”.
Page 12:
“exploratory models were conducted…”, “The model included the total score…”: all this
information stating which kind of analyses were conducted should be already presented in the
data analyses section and not in the results section.
Tables
The “variable” column in Table 1 is superfluous and, thus, can be deleted.
Tables and figures should be self-explanatory, that is, readers should understand their content
without having to read the main text. This means that all abbreviations used in a table should be
explained in the table notes (e.g., FStotal, Ktotal, BMI, Y/N). Alternatively, I suggesting avoid
abbreviations completely and writing out all terms in full.
Why are there no values for triceps, FStotal, and BMI in Table 2? What’s the point of including
these rows when they do not include any statistical values?
The singular of triceps is triceps and not tricep

Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. I found the paper interesting and
informative, weaving together literature and empirical work effectively. It was clear and well-
written. I thought the paper was publishable as is, without need for additional revisions (I saw
that I am seeing a second round of the paper, and appreciated the comments of the previous
reviewer). While I could not adequately assess the quality of the quantitative analysis, it seems
robust.
In my own, very small qualitative piece of work on the consumption of clay during pregnancy
amongst cross-border migrants to South Africa, I felt that the social and cultural experience of
pregnancy has sometimes been de-emphasized in favour of focusing on biological motivations or
consequences. Trying to understand the idea of "bargaining" --
as you begin to here-- might show how cravings are a window on broader pregnancy
experiences, and experiences of being a woman in a specific time and place. To me, the impact of
these experiences on health-- the contexts in which cravings play out-- loom much larger than
any health impact of fulfilling the cravings themselves.
In this spirit, and only if space allows, I would encourage the author to consider expanding the
closing two sentences (maybe cutting that last sentence, unless expanded quite a bit: to me that
sounds like a call for a big longitudinal food consumption study, and leaves me guessing more
than it needs to). I agree that cravings have public health implications, and would be interested to
hear the authors' perspective on what these implications might be, and how to relate to them. To
me this would be a good time to return to perspectives/voice of respondents in the study. This is
a very minor comment and does not require action unless it feels helpful.

Dear Editor,
Thank you for the acceptance of my manuscript. I have read the comments made by the reviewer,
and feel as though the reviewer made an excellent point that biological explanations of diet in
pregnancy are insufficient to understand the complex experience of pregnant women. As per the
reviewer's suggestion, I have included this in the concluding paragraph and have removed the
last sentence from the previous version of the manuscript. Please let me know if there are any
additional changes you need from me at this time.

s is the revised version of manuscript RSOS-170243. I have addressed all comments and
gestions made by reviewers, and have made several revisions to improve the manuscript.
cifically, the “cultural distress” hypothesis has now been reframed in evolutionary terms as a
ial bargaining model with specific predictions about the types of items women should crave
er this hypothesis. In addition, I reframed the resource scarcity model to target nutritional
ds rather than cravings more generally. After incorporating these changes, the results still
vide support for the social bargaining model. The implications for these results are discussed.

e, I think it will be a useful contribution to the literature, but it’s not quite ready for
lication yet. I have four main concerns:
The psychological stress hypothesis is not adequately developed at the moment. In particular,
ink the author needs to specify a mechanistic link between psychological stress and cravings.
not immediately obvious why the former should lead to the latter. At the moment, it seems
usible that psychological stress and cravings are associated because of a third, unmeasured
iable. Consequently, I think the author needs to clarify the logic of the hypothesis. In addition,
ink it is a mistake to set up the psychological stress hypothesis in opposition to evolutionary
lanations. I think it would be better for the author to rephrase the psychological stress
othesis in evolutionary terms, and to alter the title too.
nk you for this suggestion. The psychological distress hypothesis has now been reframed as a
ial bargaining strategy, such that women who cannot conform to cultural standards of the
al family crave abortifacients from both and evolutionarily and social perspective. The title
also been changed.
’m also not convinced by the author’s test of the psychological stress hypothesis. I don’t
k it’s adequate to simply posit that psychological stress prompts cravings. The cravings
arly aren’t random, so the total number of cravings and the presence/absence of cravings are
important than the pattern of cravings. So, I think the author needs to outline what the
chological stress hypothesis predicts vis-à-vis pattern of cravings, and then test that
diction. That is, she needs to make the test of the psychological stress hypothesis more like
test of the first two hypotheses.
ve now included a more specific test of the psychological distress hypothesis. I predict that
men will crave food items that are considered abortifacients: toxic and/or pathogenic items,
culturally-proscribed items: “hot” foods, unripe mango, unripe tamarind.
The last point also holds for the resource scarcity hypothesis. Again, because the cravings
n’t random, the total number of cravings and the presence/absence of cravings is less
ortant than the pattern of cravings. As before, the key question is, what are the predictions of
resource scarcity hypothesis for the pattern of cravings?
s hypothesis is now reframed to predict that women will crave nutritious items to buffer the
cts of inadequate access to resources.
’m concerned that the test of the resource scarcity hypothesis is confounded by the nature of
e of the items craved. The author discounted the hypothesis because the items with the
hest calories were not preferentially selected. However, the items in question—fish curry and
yani—are normally prepared with strongly-flavored spices, and there is reason to expect
gnant women to develop aversions to strong-tasting plant foods. Such flavours often indicate
presence of chemicals produced by plants as a deterrent against consumption by other
anism, i.e. toxic chemicals (Flaxman and Sherman, 2000). Thus, the expectation that fish
ry and biriyani should be craved more than mango and tamarind may not be reasonable. With
in mind, I think the analysis needs to be redone after incorporating a control for the presence
otentially toxic chemicals.
ve included a measure that captures both toxicity and pathogenicity of craved food items
ce both can serve as a threat to the fetus. As the reviewer suspected, this is a confounding
iable. I discuss the implications of this result in the discussion.
so have a minor suggestion, which is that it would be really helpful for the author to include a
e that summarizes the variables included in each model. Backing out the details of the models
m the text is not straightforward, so a summary table would really help for the reader.
od suggestion. A table is now included.
