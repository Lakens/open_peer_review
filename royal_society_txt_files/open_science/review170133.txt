I have only very minimal comments to make on this manuscript.
Introduction: While I appreciate a concise manuscript, I think the introduction could use just a bit
of expansion to familiarize the reader with an unfamiliar piece of anatomy. In the statement “As
shown in Figure 1, the morphology observed in the knee joint of ostriches is unique in many
ways…”, could you expand briefly on how they are unique, summarizing a few points from
Chadwick et al. 2014? Just a couple of sentences I think would make a difference for
understanding the uniqueness of this anatomical structure.
Discussion: During my first read-through of the paper, I didn’t see an obvious link between the
hypothesis, results, and discussion, and I think that’s because only the first paragraph of the
discussion deals with the hypothesis presented in the introduction. I think the discussion might
need to be just slightly expanded in order to strengthen the discussion of the key results of the
FEA analyses of the tendon model and how they align with the observed morphology of the
ostrich patella. I was really interested in the transformation diagram in figure 2, but I didn’t feel
like your results were discussed with reference to that diagram very much. Could you frame
some of your discussion around how the results relate to those transformations? I see that these
are mentioned sporadically in the results section, but given that some readers will probably head
straight for the discussion and bypass the results, I think reiterating the most important aspects of
the results in the discussion is important.
General figure comments: Additional labels and more detailed figure captions will probably be
appreciated by readers. Labels indicating the patellae, femur, and tibia, tendon, muscle groups,
etc. will help orient the reader. In Figure 4, I wasn’t totally sure what I was looking at in the
bottom row, although I assume the red areas are the patellae? Labels on the diagram, or a colour
legend for the bottom row, would be really helpful. I’d also just copy over the description of
figure 4 for figure 5, rather than make people flip back to an earlier figure for a description of
what they’re looking at. For these figures, could you also add a label indicating where in the knee
the section is located – so, medial, midline, lateral, or something along those lines?
Other than these comments, I like the approach used in this paper on an interesting aspect of
vertebrate anatomy, and look forward to seeing the final version published!

I enjoyed reading this paper presenting a hypothesis for the existence of two patellae in ostriches.
I have a number of minor comments that I'd like the authors to address or comment on prior to
publication.
Title - in my view the title does not hint at the main hypothesis of the paper, so the authors may
wish to consider changing this with a focus on the patellae.
Abstract - "roughly effective predictor" - this seems to be a bit of a half-way house, either it has
the potential to be an effective predictor or not.
Lines 104 to 108 - please give more details of the mesh convergence study. What parameter was
used to assess convergence. The refined mesh has 100x the number of elements as the adopted
mesh. What mesh sizes were used in between to confirm convergence at the lower number of
elements
Lines 119 to 123 - the use of a complete musculoskeletal model suggests that load cases from a
large number of frames could have been used. How was the load case that was used decided on
and were significant changes to the strain distributions noticed for other load cases?
Around line 131 - although the model is made available it might be helpful for those not familiar
with ostrich anatomy to label muscles on figure 1.
Figure 2 and results (Figures 4 to 6) - while I appreciate that specific values of the strain
distributions could be obtained form the model I think it reasonable that broad ranges could be
indicated for the benefit of readers who will not have access to FE software to check the reported
distributions against. I feel it is important to demonstrate that the tissue differentiation the
authors are proposing could occur at reasonable strain values.
Without adaptive modelling of tissue properties the study feels slightly incomplete. While this
would be beyond the current scope, perhaps further comment could be added with the use
Figure 1 to illustrate how a change of material property would be expected to influence the strain
distribution in a manner that would go from soft tissue to fibrocartilage to bone (unless I have
misunderstood this second transition).

Two experts have reviewed your paper on the patellae of the ostrich and recommend publication
subject to minor revisions. They both found the hypothesis for the existence of two patellae in the
ostrich to be interesting and compelling, and both suggest this might make a more interesting
focus for the title of the paper. Reviewer 1 raises a couple of additional points for improving the
logical flow and clarity of the manuscript, and reviewer 2 requests the addition of a few more
methodological details and asks whether the authors have scope to comment more on the
adaptive modelling of tissues and specifically how a shift from soft-tissue to fibrocartilage to

Thank you for thoroughly addressing the comments of the referees. I'm happy to accept the
revised version of the manuscript, but do have one additional point for further clarification in the
revised manuscript.
One line 312-313: The added text 'This unusual evolutionary history further justifies the diverse
loading conditions we used in our study.’ could use slight revision to be clear what you mean by
10
‘diverse loading conditions’ because your current study focused on one specific instant in
locomotion of an adult ostrich. I think the authors are referring here to the proximal, distal and
full loading models? If so, explicitly stating this would help.

Introduction: While I appreciate a concise manuscript, I think the introduction could use just a bit of

couple of sentences I think would make a difference for understanding the uniqueness of this anatomical
structure.
Good point- we have added several more sentences here as requested, giving some broader context
about sesamoids and ostrich knees.
Discussion: During my first read-through of the paper, I didn’t see an obvious link between the
hypothesis, results, and discussion, and I think that’s because only the first paragraph of the discussion
deals with the hypothesis presented in the introduction. I think the discussion might need to be just
slightly expanded in order to strengthen the discussion of the key results of the FEA analyses of the

section, but given that some readers will probably head straight for the discussion and bypass the
results, I think reiterating the most important aspects of the results in the discussion is important.
Another good point (also raised by the other reviewer), which we have now addressed.
General figure comments: Additional labels and more detailed figure captions will probably be
appreciated by readers. Labels indicating the patellae, femur, and tibia, tendon, muscle groups, etc. will
help orient the reader. In Figure 4, I wasn’t totally sure what I was looking at in the bottom row,
although I assume the red areas are the patellae? Labels on the diagram, or a colour legend for the
bottom row, would be really helpful. I’d also just copy over the description of figure 4 for figure 5, rather
than make people flip back to an earlier figure for a description of what they’re looking at. For these
figures, could you also add a label indicating where in the knee the section is located – so, medial,
midline, lateral, or something along those lines?
We have revised Figures 2 and 4-6 accordingly, and also improved Figure 7.
Other than these comments, I like the approach used in this paper on an interesting aspect of vertebrate

I enjoyed reading this paper presenting a hypothesis for the existence of two patellae in ostriches. I
have a number of minor comments that I'd like the authors to address or comment on prior to
publication.
Title - in my view the title does not hint at the main hypothesis of the paper, so the authors may wish to
consider changing this with a focus on the patellae.
We agree: we have changed the title.
Abstract - "roughly effective predictor" - this seems to be a bit of a half-way house, either it has the
potential to be an effective predictor or not.
We feel that we have to be vague here as our analysis shows that the tissue differentiation approach
works OK for the proximal patella but not so much for the distal patella. And even when it does predict
where a non-tendinous patella might be favoured, the match between the high compressive and shear
strains and the actual morphology is not perfect – nor would we expect it to be, for many reasons. We
have addressed the major reasons for this mismatch in the Discussion and feel that the wording in the
abstract is the right wording- “roughly effective predictor” conveys the uncertainty involved; it is not a
binary perfect/imperfect issue. And, to be clear, our study addresses whether stress and strain are
homogeneous throughout the patellar tendon or heterogeneous. The latter outcome is more consistent
with the predictions of mechanobiology (e.g. tissue differentiation theory) in regards to finding multiple
locations where tissue transformation would be favoured by mechanical loading conditions; regardless of
adult patellar morphology.
Lines 104 to 108 - please give more details of the mesh convergence study. What parameter was used
to assess convergence. The refined mesh has 100x the number of elements as the adopted mesh. What
mesh sizes were used in between to confirm convergence at the lower number of elements?
We did not do a detailed convergence study but used a much larger mesh to test if the results differed,
which they did not, so we feel this is more than adequate given the goals of our study (e.g. not
predicting precise loads or safety factors); however, we have removed the term “convergence of” before
“patterns” and replaced it with “similar”, to avoid implying that an exhaustive convergence analysis was
done across a spectrum of mesh sizes.
Lines 119 to 123 - the use of a complete musculoskeletal model suggests that load cases from a large
number of frames could have been used. How was the load case that was used decided on and were
significant changes to the strain distributions noticed for other load cases?
We have added some explanation for our decisions in the analysis, to the Methods and Discussion. More
frames and loads could be studied in the future but that would be beyond the scope of this study. Our
open data allow others to inspect a wide range of possible loads or other mechanisms in follow-up
studies, too.
Around line 131 - although the model is made available it might be helpful for those not familiar with
ostrich anatomy to label muscles on figure 1.
Done
Figure 2 and results (Figures 4 to 6) - while I appreciate that specific values of the strain distributions
could be obtained form the model I think it reasonable that broad ranges could be indicated for the
benefit of readers who will not have access to FE software to check the reported distributions against. I
feel it is important to demonstrate that the tissue differentiation the authors are proposing could occur
at reasonable strain values.
Good point; we have done so for Figures 4-6. For Figure 2, qualitative axes are ideal because it is a
theoretical construct that could potentially work for any reasonable range of axis values.
Without adaptive modelling of tissue properties the study feels slightly incomplete. While this would be
beyond the current scope, perhaps further comment could be added with the use Figure 1 to illustrate
how a change of material property would be expected to influence the strain distribution in a manner
that would go from soft tissue to fibrocartilage to bone (unless I have misunderstood this second
transition).
We have now addressed this (in text) at the end of the study, which is an important point to make clear
and we thank the reviewer for raising this. We have also clarified how our results do and do not address
the issue of exactly where patellae are located in our adult ostrich vs. where mechanobiology might
favour them.
